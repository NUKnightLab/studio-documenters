A very rough pass at looking at documents that contain money references.

Right now just lists monetary values and keywords for documents that contain money references. Select a money value to see docs that contain that value with doc summaries.

```
 $ cp env.example .env
 $ pip install -r requirements.txt
 $ flask run
```

Alternatively, set environment variables via `export` instead of using .env


Be sure to have a document set wherever you have defined DOCS_DIR to be.
