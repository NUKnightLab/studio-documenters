Financial Statements as of June 30, 2018

Abel Rodriguez led the group through the 2018 SSA#1-2015 Budget Summary (Second Quarter Financial
Statement) as of June 30, 2018. The first column of the document contained the yellow highlighted Proposed
Changes to the Budget. The second column held the original budget. The third column detailed the Actual
2018 Totals to Date, their percentage of completion, and the balance. The 2018 budget feeds into the 2019

 budget. The line item of SSA Late Collections and Interest is $177,720 under the Proposed 2018 Amended
Budget. Since the audit has been completed, this is a hard number. However, the original budget allotted
$190,000 for this line item, so the proposal is to change this to the actual number and reduce some of the line
items by a little over $12,000.
The second line item change proposed was Geocentric, who does website development and ongoing upgrades.
Last year (2017) the Commission approved $105,000 for a new website. We only spent about $55,000 of that
and added the rest to carry-over in 2018. But we still needed $46,000 to complete the website and no money
was allocated in the 2018 budget for that. So, the amended budget would take that money back out of the carryover. The total project cost will still be $105,000 between 2017 and 2018. The new website launches next
month.
Under public way aesthetics, graffiti removal was at $15,000 in 2018. We were buying special wipes, but the
Clean Team exhausted that supply and began using their own spray remover, so we don’t need the money in
this line item in the amended budget. We will remove that amount.
Often when we create the yearly budget we put everything in the carry-over under Infrastructure Maintenance.
But now that we have a hard number, we are going to reallocate that carry-over. $43,000 was taken out of the
$109,960 allocated for sidewalks in 2018 in order to put it back into website development, leaving us with
$66,960 in that sidewalk line in the amended budget.
On the second page of the Budget Summary, we had budgeted $50,000 as start-up costs for the Police
Engagement (off-duty) program. However, the cost of hours in the first month (March) alone was $12,500
because of the court time involved. So, to maintain the level of security services for the remainder of the year
(2 officers/guards for 3 days—a total of 24 hours-- a week plus court appearances) the budget was increased
to $112,500 for 2018. This year’s budget had allocated funding for hiring 2 more street ambassadors, however
there has been difficulty finding the right candidates, so the money we would have used for the salary of one
of those individuals can be reallocated to the police engagement program. (Commissioner Greenberg asked
if real estate taxes didn’t pay for a police presence. Chair Voshel responded that we have had many discussions
about this; stakeholders were not happy with what the city provided and desired additional security.)
At the bottom of page 2 of the 2018 SSA #1-2015 Budget Summary was a column of items showing how we
arrived at the projected carry-over:
• $26,000 was budgeted for a public relations firm on an as-needed basis, but CLA hired a full-time inhouse person and there appears to be no need for a firm for the rest of the year. We can’t just take it
out of the budget, but we know that we’re not going to use it.
• Under Lightscape programming, we ran into a glitch with the person that we hired to develop and
update software. The contract was terminated by mutual agreement, the work was not completed (we
did receive a beta test version), and they refunded us the money back ($8,000.)
• Inland Marine Insurance is going to cost us $3,000. That’s a hard number and we will not be seeing
any more bills coming in.
• We will not be using $4,000 for sidewalk cleaning and snow removal; that was a contingency amount
set aside in case snow exceeded the contractually allowed 48”.
• Contingency funding is also the reason why there were $14,000 unused dollars in the Pressure Washing
line item. It was there to cover any unscheduled cleaning that might be needed if one of our sports
teams won a series/season or if there was construction or accident clean-up.
• It was decided not to do the Strategic Plan Refresh ($17,335.) We believe we are still on the right path.
• We have not hired the additional ambassador yet, so we split the allocated salary by half to reflect
wages we did not pay for the first part of the year ($27,000.)
• Under the Homeless Outreach and Panhandling Program, we’ve already paid for guides that will last
us for the rest of the year, and there was an additional $6,000 remaining.

 This all totals to be $105,335 in carry-over for next year’s 2019 budget. We like to be cautiously optimistic,
so we will be using the figure of $110,000 in 2019 budget development. Hearing no questions, Chair Voshel
asked for a vote to accept the budget amendments. The motion was made by Commissioner Greenberg and
seconded by Commissioner Davids. It passed unanimously.
The 2nd Quarter Performance Review/Metrics spreadsheet was sent out to Commissioners prior to the meeting
for their review, and then also included in meeting packets. There were no surprises and no questions. A
motion to accept them was made by Commissioner Davids and seconded by Commissioner Cameron. The
motion passed unanimously.

Sole Service Provider Report: 2019 SSA Final Budget Draft and Retention of CLA

Michael Edwards explained that the City of Chicago has a robust timeline to put SSA budgets together. At the
direction of the State Street Commission, the Sole Service Provider, Chicago Loop Alliance, developed the
first 2019 budget draft to comply with their request that it should be a zero-based budget containing only what
was necessary. This draft was submitted to the Commission, who discussed and refined it, knowing it might
change again because this year’s EAV had yet to be released.
Meeting packets contained a final draft of SSA#1-2015’s budget for 2019 requiring the approval of
Commissioners. Items highlighted in yellow indicated the changes that were made since the Commissioners
saw the budget the last time, prior to the EAV’s release.
When the new EAV finally did come out, we found it had increased by over 12% from last year, bringing in
new revenue. The EAV went from $765 million to $858 million. Honoring the Commission’s dictate to keep
the .3465% special service area rate the same still allowed CLA to take advantage of the increased revenue
and add additional needs to the draft budget. Even though the rate itself did not change, the amount of money
we will receive automatically did, which means we are required to have a public community meeting. Anytime
the SSA budget goes up by more than 5% (due to a new EAV or any other reason) we are required to have a
public meeting prior to City Council approval.
Edwards commented on some of the 2019 budget changes and additions. CLA has talked at length about
developing additional marketing to address the crises in the retail market and how we can remain vital; $20,000
more was added to that line item. We’ve also discussed a Re-Imagine State Street Visioning Plan to address
our crumbling infrastructure and prepare State Street for different mixed needs in the future. The project was
originally budgeted at $125,000 but the decision was made to do only Phase 1 of the visioning plan at this
time, which is data gathering. It is estimated to cost $75,000 – a cost proposed to be split 50/50 by CLA and
the SSA ($37,500 each). The CLA Board also talked about increasing the percentage allotted for salaries and
staffing from 3% to 4%. Two contracts are up for new RFPs – landscaping and power-washing – and those
costs are expected to rise so that line item rose by a 20% allocation. Edwards said that he believes this budget
is fair and respects everyone’s viewpoints. The rate was not raised last year and we left money on the table.
Commissioners debated the increases of various services and the budget itself. Commissioner Greenberg felt
that it was the city’s responsibility to provide police protection, questioning increasing our budget for off-duty
police/guards. Commissioner Davids said that it was laudable that we were not increasing the rate, but he
advocated for keeping the total budget the same as last year, which would mean shaving off approximately
$190,000 to get below that budget number. He suggested cuts at the previous meeting; saving money where
we can be a good thing, especially in the current tax environment. Commissioner Cameron stated that he
didn’t understand why we were debating $190,000; we have had these conversations before. Participation is
important on a regular basis. Abel Rodriguez added that even picking and choosing cuts, we will still probably
have to hold a community meeting.

 Chair Voshel asked Michael Edwards what he would cut to achieve a $190,000 reduction. Items included:
• $19,827 from Marketing
• $40,000 from Banners
• $21,800 from Landscaping
• $15,000 from Aggregate
• $10,000 from Infrastructure Maintenance
• $25,000 from Economic Studies
• $ 5,000 from Springboard
• $57,000 from the Street Team
Commissioners debated and decided to remove the following amounts from the above list: economic study,
marketing and the Street Team (the elimination of hiring the second additional ambassador; the first additional
ambassador position’s salary had already been reallocated to the off-duty program.)
A motion to approve the 2019 SSA #1-2105 with the above changes was made by Commissioner Davids and
seconded by Commissioner Cameron. It passed unanimously.
Another motion was made by Commissioner Fitzpatrick to retain the Chicago Loop Alliance (CLA) as the sole
service provider for 2019. It was seconded by Commissioner Davids, and it also passed unanimously.
