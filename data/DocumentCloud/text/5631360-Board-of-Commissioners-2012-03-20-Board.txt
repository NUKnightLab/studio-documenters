Question/Comment

Response

This is about a contract that was awarded. The guy
who got the contract for $40 million of work at Cabrini.
90% of the people on his staff were Hispanic. I didn't
see where he hired one resident under Section 3. A
lot of people get rewarded over and over and do the
same thing. It is not equitable, what is happening to
public housing residents.

We believe the specific contract you are referencing is for
Friedler Construction, for the renovation of Cabrini Homes. This
$25,033,903 contract had a commitment of 14 Section 3 hires.
Friedler exceeded this commitment with 26 Section 3 hires.

I would like to speak about senior engagement. I
have attended more meetings since the last Board
meeting. I want to salute the CEO for the 2.0 input
meetings. I would also like to advocate on behalf of
seniors and I would like seniors to become more
involved with technology. Seniors could start the
morning with reports to their families. This could be
the start of health awareness for seniors. I look
forward to continuing work with Donna Dixon, who is
on the front lines.

Resident Service Coordinators (RSC) are in all senior buildings
and their focus and responsibility is to improve the quality of life
for senior residents. In addition, RSCs will work with resident
leadership to provide additional services and activities if
residents show interest.

Qualification for a Section 3 hire is not dependent on race.
