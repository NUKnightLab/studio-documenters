BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF COOK COUNTY
PRESIDENT
VETOES
Transmitting a Communication, dated May 11, 2009 from
TODD H. STROGER, President, Cook County Board of Commissioners
In accordance with the authority granted to me by section 2-6008 of the Counties Code and for the
reasons stated herein, I hereby transmit to you my veto of an amendment made to the Home Rule County
Retailer’s Occupation Tax (Chapter 74 Taxation, Article IV, Sections 74-150 through 74-152) passed by
the Board of Commissioners on May 5, 2009. Please place my veto message on the agenda for the next
meeting of the Cook County Board of Commissioners, May 19, 2009.
Please be advised that I am exercising my veto authority as President of the Board of Commissioners and
hereby veto Item No. 6 from the May 5, 2009, Cook County Board Meeting Agenda wherein the Cook
County Board of Commissioners amended the Home Rule County Retailer’s Occupation Tax reducing
the retailer’s occupation tax by 1% effective, January 1, 2010.

1524

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 19, 2009
When I took office in December, 2006, Cook County was facing a deficit of over $500 million in a
budget of approximately $3 billion. Ratification of union contracts with yearly pay increases and other
enhancements with no identified source of revenue to pay for them contributed heavily to that budget
deficit—actions taken before I took office. To solve the Fiscal Year 2007 budget crisis, I called on
everyone in Cook County Government to cut 17% from offices across the board. My office led the way
with a 19% reduction from what was budgeted in FY 2006.
In Fiscal Year 2008, after cutting more than $125 million from initial budget shortfall estimates and
holding the line on property taxes, I asked the Cook County taxpayer to pay more in sales tax to pay for a
public health system and for vital services.
Before taxpayers were asked for one penny more in taxes, my Administration made substantial cuts in
county government spending. This was also the 12th year that Cook County did not raise the property tax
levy on its homeowners. After much debate, the majority of the Board of Commissioners voted to raise
the Cook County portion of the sales tax by one penny for the Fiscal Year 2008 budget. I truly believe the
one penny increase was the responsible course of action to take and obviously a majority of the Board of
Commissioners agreed with me.
When the Board of Commissioners agreed to raise the sales tax, I stood before the people of Cook County
and pledged to reduce that tax in the future if revenues increased in other areas to offset that reduction.
The approval of a new, five-year hospital assessment bill in Springfield and Washington DC that will
provide Cook County hospitals with tens of millions of dollars in new funding and an increase in funds
from a temporary FMAP increase from the federal stimulus bill allowed me to propose reducing the sales
tax by ¼%; this proposal is currently sitting in the Finance Committee. As I promised, when revenues to
replace a portion of that tax were identified, I moved to lower the tax burden on our residents.
On May 5, 2009, a majority of Cook County Commissioners voted to repeal the one penny sales tax
increase without identifying sources of revenue replacement or corresponding service reductions to close
the deficit that the government will face in Fiscal Year 2010. Those commissioners voted to eliminate
revenue that is needed to pay for county services.
Before taking this action, there was no attempt by those commissioners to gather information from other
Cook County elected officials or the Cook County Health and Hospitals System on the viability and
ramification of this action on the criminal justice and health systems.
I stand firm in my commitment to support County services and to provide adequate funding in order to
protect and provide for our County residents. I remain committed to reductions in the sales tax; however
said reductions must only be made at the appropriate intervals with a complete understanding of the
revenues needed to fund County services.
While I hereby veto the action of the Board of Commissioners on May 5, 2009, I do so with the
commitment to gather appropriate information from other Cook County elected officials and the Cook
County Health and Hospitals System. It is important to fully understand the viability and ramification of
reductions of the Home Rule County Retailer’s Occupation Tax to the criminal justice and health systems
in order to effectively address amendments to the Home Rule County Retailer’s Occupation Tax currently
sitting in the Finance Committee, including my ordinance amendment which seeks a 1/4% reduction in
the Home Rule County Retailer’s Occupation Tax.

1525

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 19, 2009
We will have the opportunity after full debate, disclosure and discussion, to reconsider this issue in a
responsible manner before the October 1, 2009 statutory deadline to alter the sales tax rate beginning
January 1, 2010.
For these reasons I urge you to reconsider your support of the repeal of the Cook County Retailer’s
Occupation Tax.

in 1948 he fought against “restrictive covenants,” a legal device which kept African-Americans out of
traditionally white neighborhoods; and
WHEREAS, also in 1948, Mr. Despres represented the American Civil Liberties Union and arranged a
showing in Chicago of “The Respectful Prostitute,” a Jean-Paul Sarte play that the Chicago police had
banned as “immoral;” later while he was an Alderman, the City Council introduced a Resolution which
included “unqualified condemnation” of Wright Junior College for including James Baldwin’s novel,
Another Country, as part of a reading list for a contemporary literature class; only two others voted with
Alderman Despres against this Resolution; and
WHEREAS, after leaving the Chicago City Council voluntarily in 1975, Mr. Despres served from 1979
to 1987 as its Parliamentarian; he also served on Chicago’s Plan Commission during this period; he
remained active in civic affairs and he and his wife, Marian, were very involved working on behalf of the
arts community; and
WHEREAS, several years ago his memoirs were published and, at the age of 100, he began writing an
online diary for the website, Slate; and
WHEREAS, in losing The Honorable Leon Despres, we have lost a true Chicago icon and a liberal
idealist of the finest caliber; and
WHEREAS, The Honorable Leon Despres is predeceased by his wife of over seventy-five years, Marian,
and leaves to mourn his son, Robert, daughter, Linda Baskin, and a grandson.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that The Honorable Leon Despres’ memory shall be
cherished in all of the hearts of the people he touched and loved; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners, on behalf of the more
than five million residents of Cook County, does hereby express its deepest condolences and most
heartfelt sympathy to the family as well as the many friends and loved ones of The Honorable Leon
Despres, and may a suitable copy of this Resolution be tendered herewith.

WHEREAS, the Comprehensive Regional Planning Fund (CRPF) is essential for the Chicago
Metropolitan Agency for Planning (CMAP) and other Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPO’s)
across the state to continue to conduct integrated planning of land use, transportation, housing, water,
natural resources, economic development, and more; and
WHEREAS, in 2005, the General Assembly and the Governor passed legislation to create the Regional
Planning Board (now named CMAP) by combining the Chicago Area Transportation Study (CATS) and
the Northeastern Illinois Planning Commission (NIPC). The bill received broad support from local
elected leaders and the civic and business communities to integrate planning for land use and
transportation in the seven-county region; and
WHEREAS, CMAP is developing the first comprehensive regional plan since Daniel Burnham’s Plan of
Chicago in 1901 through the agency’s GO TO2040 process. CMAP is coming to be viewed across the
seven counties of metropolitan Chicago as the best hope for accommodating an additional 2.8 million
residents expected by 2040; and
WHEREAS, the Comprehensive Regional Planning Fund was created by Public Act 95-0677. Funds are
disbursed by the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) providing $5 million annually to support
regional planning in Illinois, of which $3.5 million is for CMAP. As the federally designated MPO for
our region, CMAP has an overall budget that relies primarily on $11 million in U.S. Department of
Transportation funds, which federal law requires be spent for regional transportation planning, with a 20
percent matching requirement; and
WHEREAS, Illinois and the Chicago region are preparing for long-overdue infrastructure investments
that depend on billions in federal stimulus and transportation funding. The Comprehensive Regional
Planning Fund is a guaranteed cost-effective way for Illinois to help ensure that taxpayers get
accountability and transparency in how public investments are made; and
WHEREAS, loss of the CRPF will seriously reduce regional planning capacity and cause a disastrous
“domino effect” whereby our region’s forfeit of $11 million in federal planning funds would render
CMAP unable to manage the regional Transportation Improvement Program (TIP), jeopardizing all of the
region’s federal transportation dollars and projects which total $2 billion annually as well as all of the
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) economic stimulus funds and any new state capital
bill intended to leverage federally appropriated dollars; and
WHEREAS, the Comprehensive Regional Planning Fund is a critical component of funding for essential
regional planning and accountability, the loss of which would cause significant harm to the region and the
state.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County urges
Governor Quinn and the General Assembly to fully reinstate the Comprehensive Regional Planning Fund
to the State of Illinois FY10 budget; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a suitable copy of this Resolution be tendered to Governor Pat
Quinn, the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT), and the members of the Illinois General
Assembly representing Cook County and may it also be spread upon the official proceedings of this
Honorable Body.
Approved and adopted this 19th day of May 2009.

COUNTY COMMISSIONERS
A RESOLUTION CALLING FOR AN UPDATE TO THE STATE ROAD FUNDING FORMULA
TO REFLECT A SIGNIFICANT SHIFT IN STATE DEMOGRAPHICS
WHEREAS, Illinois’ existing road funding formula does not address the shifting demographics in the
state over the last 50 years; and
WHEREAS, according to a report from the General Assembly’s Legislative Research Unit requested by
Senator Martin Sandoval, Chairman of the Illinois Senate Transportation Committee, more than 63
percent of Illinoisans live in the Chicago area, which accounts for more than half the vehicles and miles
traveled in the state. About half of the more than 6 billion gallons of motor fuel sold in Illinois in fiscal
2008 were used in the six-county Chicago region; and
WHEREAS, this demographic shift clearly indicates that Northeastern Illinois, the third largest
metropolitan region in the country, deserves a much larger distribution of state road funds than the 45
percent it is now allocated from the current formula; and
WHEREAS, the addition of 2.8 million residents expected by the year 2040 in the six counties of
metropolitan Chicago further intensifies the justification to change the formula; and
WHEREAS, from 1999 to 2007, state road fund allocations in the six-county Chicago area ranged from
about 32 percent of the statewide total to about 44 percent. In 2008, 37.5 percent of the total spent
amounted to $725.6 million. Spending outside the Chicago region for 2008 was 62.5 percent or $1.2
billion; and
WHEREAS, it is the responsibility of local and state governments to cooperate in the planning and
funding allocation process necessary for improvements to Illinois’ transportation infrastructure; and
WHEREAS, sweeping changes are necessary in the current state highway spending formula used for
road allocations in the fiscal 2010 state transportation budget. Allocations should be reversed in order to
reflect the most current demographic and economic data and to provide a fair share of funding to
Northeastern Illinois.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County calls
upon Governor Quinn, the General Assembly and the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) to
study the road funding formula and make the appropriate changes indicated by current state
demographics; and

COOK COUNTY GREEN CONSTRUCTION ORDINANCE (PROPOSED
ORDINANCE). Transmitting a Communication from Roberto Maldonado, County
Commissioner:
submitted is the proposed Cook County Green Construction Ordinance that would require
all Cook County contractors working on public construction contracts, budgeted at $2
million or more, to use cleaner diesel fuel and pollution controls on their vehicles and
equipment. I will introduce this ordinance at the April 15 Board meeting and refer it to
the Construction Committee.
Diesel pollution is known to cause lung cancer, asthma attacks, heart attacks, strokes, and
premature death. Our efforts to help clean up diesel pollution will improve the County’s
air quality, protect the health of the residents of Cook County, and, ultimately, reduce the
burden of health care on our public health system.
The Green Construction Ordinance will have a modest impact on construction costs. For
most green construction projects, the total costs of using cleaner fuels and pollution
controls has cost less than 1% of the total project cost.
Air pollution continues to be a serious problem in Cook County. This ordinance will help
the County meet federal air quality standards, which the County continues to violate.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 19, 2009
ARTICLE IX. GREEN CONSTRUCTION
Sec. 30-950.

Board of Commissioners findings.

(a)
Diesel exhaust particle pollution poses a clear and present health
risk to the people of Cook County. The United States Environmental Protection
Agency has classified diesel exhaust as a likely human carcinogen, and has
identified diesel particulate matter and diesel exhaust organic gases as toxic air
pollutants. Diesel exhaust is also a prime contributor to airborne fine particle
pollution that is linked to premature death and other serious cardiovascular and
pulmonary problems such as heart attacks, abnormal heart rhythms,
atherosclerosis, stroke, asthma attacks, permanent respiratory damage and
retardation of lung growth in children.
(b)
Cook County is a US EPA designated non-attainment area for
fine particulate matter pollution.
(c)
The health impacts from diesel emissions particularly affect
children, the elderly, and people with weakened immune systems.
(d)
Particularly high concentrations of diesel emissions often occur
in heavily traveled transportation corridors, intermodal yards, bus depots, and
construction sites; these diesel “hot spots” often are found in densely populated,
urban areas, disproportionately impacting ethnic minorities and people of lower
economic status.
(e)
Diesel engine crankcases also are a source of emissions that can
seep into the cabin and expose vehicle drivers and passengers to harmful diesel
emissions.
(f)
Diesel exhaust also contains black carbon emissions, which
contribute to global climate change.
(g)
Reduction of diesel emissions can help address these human
health and environmental problems.
(h)
The United States Environmental Protection Agency has enacted
requirements over the past few years requiring the substantial reduction of
emissions from new diesel engines in both heavy-duty highway vehicles and
land-based non-road equipment. However, these regulations do not apply to any
of the over 11 million existing diesel engines in the United States, most of which
emit substantially more pollution and often remain in service for 10 to 30 years,
depending on the type of engine and equipment.
(i)
Practical, cost-effective measures to substantially reduce diesel
particulate emissions are available today, and can be applied to many existing
diesel engines. The same technology that limits diesel pollution from new diesel
engines can be retrofitted onto existing engines or applied in new replacement
engines to reduce diesel emissions by 85% or better.

1616

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 19, 2009
(j)
Therefore, the purpose of this ordinance is to minimize the
public health risks from exposure to diesel particulate emissions as expeditiously
as practicable.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 19, 2009
COOK COUNTY GREEN CONSTRUCTION ORDINANCE
BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that Chapter 30 Environment, Article
IX Green Construction, Sections 30-950 through 30-955 of the Cook County Code are hereby enacted as
follows:
ARTICLE IX. GREEN CONSTRUCTION
Sec. 30-950.

Board of Commissioners findings.

(a)
Diesel exhaust particle pollution poses a clear and present health risk to the people of
Cook County. The United States Environmental Protection Agency has classified diesel exhaust as a
likely human carcinogen, and has identified diesel particulate matter and diesel exhaust organic gases as
toxic air pollutants. Diesel exhaust is also a prime contributor to airborne fine particle pollution that is
linked to premature death and other serious cardiovascular and pulmonary problems such as heart attacks,
abnormal heart rhythms, atherosclerosis, stroke, asthma attacks, permanent respiratory damage and
retardation of lung growth in children.
(b)
pollution.

Cook County is a US EPA designated non-attainment area for fine particulate matter

(c)
The health impacts from diesel emissions particularly affect children, the elderly, and
people with weakened immune systems.
(d)
Particularly high concentrations of diesel emissions often occur in heavily traveled
transportation corridors, intermodal yards, bus depots, and construction sites; these diesel “hot spots”
often are found in densely populated, urban areas, disproportionately impacting ethnic minorities and
people of lower economic status.
(e)
Diesel engine crankcases also are a source of emissions that can seep into the cabin and
expose vehicle drivers and passengers to harmful diesel emissions.
(f)

Diesel exhaust also contains black carbon emissions, which contribute to global climate

(g)
problems.

Reduction of diesel emissions can help address these human health and environmental

change.

(h)
The United States Environmental Protection Agency has enacted requirements over the
past few years requiring the substantial reduction of emissions from new diesel engines in both heavyduty highway vehicles and land-based non-road equipment. However, these regulations do not apply to
any of the over 11 million existing diesel engines in the United States, most of which emit substantially
more pollution and often remain in service for 10 to 30 years, depending on the type of engine and
equipment.
(i)
Practical, cost-effective measures to substantially reduce diesel particulate emissions are
available today, and can be applied to many existing diesel engines. The same technology that limits
diesel pollution from new diesel engines can be retrofitted onto existing engines or applied in new
replacement engines to reduce diesel emissions by 85% or better.

1623

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 19, 2009
(j)
Therefore, the purpose of this ordinance is to minimize the public health risks from
exposure to diesel particulate emissions as expeditiously as practicable.

TEMPORARY DETENTION CENTER AND THE COOK COUNTY JAIL
(PROPOSED RESOLUTION). Submitting a Proposed Resolution sponsored by Earlean
Collins, County Commissioner.
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
REVIEW OF THE COOK COUNTY JUVENILE TEMPORARY
DETENTION CENTER AND THE COOK COUNTY JAIL
WHEREAS, Cook County is a home rule unit of local government pursuant to Article
VII, Section 6 (a) of the 1970 Illinois Constitution, and as such may exercise any power
and perform any function pertaining to its government and affairs; and

1629

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 19, 2009
WHEREAS, on April 14, 2009 a meeting was held at the Cook County Juvenile
Temporary Detention Center (“CCJTDC”) at which time Transitional Administrator Earl
Dunlap presented a progress report on the state of the facility; and
WHEREAS, the guests were provided with information on the changes and
improvements that have occurred at the CCJTDC since the arrival of Transitional
Administrator Earl L. Dunlap in additional to future plans and continuing development of
the facility; and
WHEREAS, this information is valuable in evaluating our compliance with the
Memorandum of Agreement and should be presented to the Cook County Board of
Commissioners; and
WHEREAS, we are also under a Federal Consent Decree regarding the Cook County Jail
and are in need of a progress report in determining our compliance with that decree.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that this Board conduct quarterly hearings
of the Cook County Juvenile Temporary Detention Center and the Cook County Jail.
*Referred to the Committee on Criminal Justice 05/05/09.
*Note: The above item can also be found under the Board of Commissioners in this Journal of
Proceedings, page 1535.
Patrick T. Driscoll, Jr. - Deputy State’s Attorney, Chief, Civil Actions Bureau, stated that Doe v. The
Juvenile Temporary Detention Center is pending in United States District Court before Chief Judge
Holderman who has the case on reassignment from Judge Nordberg. This case started in 1999 and was
filed by the ACLU as a class action covering all detainees at the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center
(JTDC). In 2002 there was an original agreement entered into by Cook County and the plaintiffs that was
modified again in November 2005. The 2006 Agreed Supplemental Order Modified Implementation Plan
was filed in May 2007. The plaintiffs were not satisfied with the progress that was being made and
moved to ask for the court to take further action to ensure compliance in order to avoid a very protracted
trial and to continue to go forward. The County and the plaintiffs entered into an agreement resulting in a
court order being entered on August 14, 2007 appointing Earl L. Dunlap as Transitional Administrator to
take over the operation of the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center, in order to put the JTDC in
substantial compliance with the prior agreements that had been entered into by the County - not just
partial compliance - to ensure all agreements are being honored.
The Illinois State legislature passed a statute that transferred the control of the Juvenile Temporary
Detention Center from the Office of the President to the Chief Judge of the Circuit Court of Cook County.
Chief Judge Evans by statute is the employer at the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center - Mr. Dunlap is
the agent of the court.
DSA Driscoll stated that the daily population at the jail is 9,000 inmates. There are 9,751 available beds
and the inmates are no longer bunking on the floors. The Cook County Board of Commissioners has

RESOLUTION REGARDING REVIEW OF FEDERAL STIMULUS DOLLARS FOR
COOK COUNTY’S UNEMPLOYED ADULTS, DISLOCATED WORKERS AND
YOUTH (PROPOSED RESOLUTION). Submitting a Proposed Resolution sponsored
by Earlean Collins, County Commissioner.
RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, Cook County is a home rule unit of local government pursuant to Article
VII, Section 6 (a) of the 1970 Illinois Constitution, and as such may exercise any power
and perform any function pertaining to its government and affairs; and
WHEREAS, the President’s Office of Employment Training (“P.O.E.T”) along with the
Cook County Workforce Investment Board (“WIA”) are committed to assisting the
residents of suburban Cook County through the administration of the federally supported
WIA program which provides residents with employment training, job placement, and
educational opportunities; and
WHEREAS, statistics show that long term unemployment individuals are more likely to
turn to crime and with unemployment rates in Cook County above the national average it
is paramount that P.O.E.T. along with the Workforce Investment Board utilize the 15.5
million dollars from the Federal Economic Stimulus Package dollars effectively.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that this Board conduct a public hearing to
discuss the allocation of 15.5 million dollars for Cook County’s unemployed adults,
dislocated workers and youth.
*Referred to the Committee on Criminal Justice 05/05/09.

*Note: The above item can also be found under the Board of Commissioners in this Journal of
Proceedings, page 1534.
Charles Jenrich, Chairman of the Cook County Workforce Investment Board (WIB), stated it is an honor
to have been chosen for the task at hand. The role of the WIB is to oversee those dollars that come to us
for the South and West of Cook County. The WIB is approximately 54% private enterprise. The WIB
looks for directions from the President’s Office of Employment Training. The monies are mandated
through the Federal and State Governments. A percentage of the dollars must go to dislocated workers,
as well as to adult and youth funding programs. The WIB has set up an oversight committee that’s
constantly evaluating the activities of the vendors and providers for their services and if they are meeting
performance expectations. The WIB has a unique opportunity this year; it is receiving 15 million dollars
which is being given to us during the stimulus period of time for activities over and above the normal
yearly plan. These dollars are provided for dislocated workers and the adult and youth population.
Karen S. Crawford, Director, President’s Office of Employment Training (P.O.E.T.), stated on February
17, 2009, President Obama signed into law the American Recovery and Re-Investment Act. P.O.E.T.
received 15.5 million dollars in American Recovery and Re-Investment Act funding to be spent in a 120
days which is by June 30, 2010. The Workforce Investment Board met last month to determine how the
funding should be utilized. Stimulus funding of 2.5 million dollars came to P.O.E.T for adult services.
The WIB, as a function of their work last month, determined that the entire 2.5 million dollars of adult
funding should be spent on apprenticeship opportunities for adults in south and west suburban Cook
County. P.O.E.T. will put out a Request for Proposal (RFP) for agencies, service providers and
companies that can facilitate apprenticeship programs, so the adult population being served can “earn as
they learn”.

1634

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 19, 2009
Director Crawford continued to state that with the youth funding, the Workforce Investment Board voted
to reactivate President Stroger’s Summer Youth Program. The WIB elected to spend 100% of funding on
summer jobs this year. P.O.E.T. put out a Request for Proposal (RFP) and in the process of gearing up
for over a thousand young people to work across Cook County in the summer jobs program. The
dislocated worker program is the largest pool of funding at 7.2 million. The WIB’s decision for the
dislocated workers’ money was to use that to focus on apprenticeships, on job training opportunities,
incumbent worker opportunities and traditional services for dislocated workers.
Chairman Collins asked the Secretary to the Board to call upon the registered public speakers, in

GRANT AWARD
Transmitting a Communication from
MAURICE S. JONES, Director, Department of Planning and Development
Re:

Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP)

transmitted herewith is a request for the approval to accept a U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD) grant for the purposes of the Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP), authorized
under Title III of the Housing Economic Recovery Act 2008 (HERA). The purpose of the Neighborhood
Stabilization Program is to assist communities that have been or are likely to be affected by foreclosed
and/or abandoned properties. The program will provide affordable rental and home ownership
opportunities to eligible income households. Cook County has been allocated $28,156,321.00 for
implementation in suburban Cook County communities with the greatest need. Cook County utilized
HUD foreclosure and abandonment data to determine priority areas that are eligible for funding.
Cook County plans to enter into NSP agreements with municipalities, non-profits, and pre-qualified
organizations to coordinate NSP activities and stabilization strategies. Cook County also anticipates that
it will leverage this grant with existing CDBG and HOME funded projects.
I respectfully request approval to accept this grant award and that the Chief of the Bureau of Capital,
Planning and Facilities Management, or his designee, is authorized to execute on behalf of the County of
Cook, any and all documents necessary to facilitate administration of the program approved here in,
including but not limited to the NSP grant agreement and any modifications thereto. The approval of this
award for administration of the program by this Honorable Body will permit the Neighborhood
Stabilization Program to move forward.
Fiscal Impact: None. Grant Award: $28,156,321.00.
The Budget Department has received all requisite documents and determined the fiscal impact on Cook
County, if any.

HOME INVESTMENT PARTNERSHIPS PROGRAMS
Transmitting a Communication from

Re:

HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME Program)

requesting re-approval of a HOME Investment Partnerships Program Loan to International Development
Equities Associates, Inc. (IDEA) for the substantial rehabilitation and conversion of the former American
Baptist Retirement Home located at 316 West Randolph, Maywood, Illinois. The original HOME Loan
was approved by the County Board of Commissioners on January 23, 2007. The first loan approval was

1658

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 19, 2009
to the Heritage Development Group which has since sold its ownership interest in the Maywood
Supportive Care I, L.P. to IDEA, Inc. The requested increase in HOME funds is a result of escalating
construction and financing cost, and the withdrawal of first mortgage financing. The additional
$1,175,000.00 in HOME funds is necessary to make the project economically feasible.
As originally presented, the rehabilitated structure was projected to have 137 supportive living units, with
78-units as HOME assisted. However, due to changes in the construction configuration, the building will
now contain 130 supportive units of which 75 will be HOME assisted. In addition to the HOME funds,
other anticipated financing will include a FHA-insured first mortgage, equity raised through the sale of
Low Income Housing Tax Credits and deferred developer fees. The development budget is now projected
at $30,786,481.00 of which the new HOME loan amount of $3,000,000.00 accounts for approximately
9.7% of the total project costs.
The terms of the HOME Program loan will be structured as a 40-year amortized loan at 1% interest that
in-keeping with the FHA-insured mortgage requirements will be subject to the availability of surplus cash
flow. It is anticipated that the County will receive annual principal and interest payments of $91,032.00
