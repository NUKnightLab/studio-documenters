How did we get here?
•

Benefit enhancements and early retirement programs enacted repeatedly since the County
statutory maximum employer match of employee contributions of 154% was set in 1984

•

Two market crashes in the past decade also caused significant shortfall in funded levels

•

County has always budgeted for the statutory maximum contribution

•

Lack of Actuarially based funding further exacerbates the issue as no automatic adjustments
were in place when market crashes occurred or benefits were increased

 Addressing Pension Fund Liabilities
•

•

The County has an Intergovernmental Agreement (“IGA”) with the Pension Fund each year
which provides for a supplemental payment in addition to the statutorily required maximum
Since 2016, the County has made supplemental payments:
Fiscal Year
2016
2017
2018
2019

•

The primary drivers of the decrease in the contribution amount from FY18 to FY19 are:
I.
II.

Assumption changes from the Experience study performed in February 2018
Investment returns during 2017

The IGA calls for the Pension Fund to provide an actuarial based funding request for 2019
The Pension Fund agrees that during Fiscal Year 2018 it will provide a calculation of additional funds
calculated by its independent actuary on the basis of the amount needed to amortize the Fund’s
Pension Liability on a 30-year basis starting in 2017 and concluding in 2047, with said amortization
payments reflecting an annual escalation factor of two-percent, and reflecting a discount rate for all
liabilities consistent with the assumed investment rate of return on fund assets and five-year
smoothing of the value of actuarial assets… the Pension Fund would provide a calculation that
anticipates layered amortization of any further actuarial losses in a period of thirty years, reflecting a
similar two-percent escalation factor for future layers.

•

Cook County’s base property tax levy has not increased in over 20 years

•

Most local governments increase their levies annually by the rate of natural growth

•

If Cook County took natural growth over the last 20 years, the base levy would be $1.18B
