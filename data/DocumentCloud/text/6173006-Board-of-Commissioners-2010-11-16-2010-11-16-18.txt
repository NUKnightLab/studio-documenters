EXPLANATION
The CHA and HACC both administer Project Based Voucher programs in Chicago and Cook County
respectively. HACC, together with its instrumentality Turnstone, is developing a 52-unit project (the
“Project”) in the City of Riverdale [Riverdale Corner Elderly Housing], of which seventeen (17)
units will be designated with project based vouchers (the “PBV Units”). The CHA, under its
Housing Choice Voucher (“HCV”) programs performs HQS unit inspections and determination of
rent reasonableness, through an independent contractor, on units rented or to be rented by its HCV
holders from private landlords
To comply with 24 CFR 983.59 and 24 CFR 983.103, which requires a housing authority to obtain
independent HQS inspection services for project based units owned by the housing authority, HACC
desires to enter into this IGA to allow CHA to serve as the independent entity to perform the HQS
inspections and determine initial rent reasonableness for the PBV Units in the Project.
When requested by HACC, CHA will perform unit inspections pursuant to 24 CFR Part 982, HQS
Special Requirements, and the Inspection Process as indicated by HACC’s Section 8 Administrative
Plan. Also, during any initial inspection, and when requested by HACC, CHA will determine rent
reasonableness. HACC will pay the CHA for the inspections performed as stated by the terms of the
agreement.
Based on the foregoing, it is in the best interest of the CHA to authorize the Chief Executive Officer
or his designee to give authorization for Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) to enter into an
Intergovernmental Agreement with The Housing Authority of Cook County (HACC).
