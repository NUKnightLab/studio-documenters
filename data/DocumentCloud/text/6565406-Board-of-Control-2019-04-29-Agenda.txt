 BC2019-324
The Department of Public Works is requesting approval of an RFP Exemption for an informal bid that was
conducting for Laundry Washers for Jail II and approval of a Recommendation of Award to the lowest and
best bidder, Belenky, Inc in the amount of $101,907.00.
These washers are needed to replace the old washers that are currently installed. The washer that are
being used now are in very poor shape and could go down at any time and be deemed unrepairable. This
process was deemed a priority and expedited to avoid any potential issues if these machines fail and
cannot be repaired. The procurement guidelines were following and this a deemed to be the quickest
and most competitive option.
The procurement method for this project was an informal bid through BuySpeed. The bid was sent to a
total of 16 vendors both through Buyspeed notifications and e-mail. All known vendors that we could find
were contacted via e-mail and encouraged to supply pricing for machines that would fit the footprint
provided in the bid document and all vendors registered for this commodity received notification from
BuySpeed regarding the opportunity to bid.
The bid was issued on March 19th and closed on March 26th.
There was 1 bid submitted for review, Belenky, Inc. The machines that they are quoting are acceptable
to the County based on the footprint provided and the machines themselves.
Contractor and Project Information
Belenky, Inc.
1601 Frederick Blvd
Akron, Ohio 44320
The Principal for the Vendor is Robert Minster.
These washers should last approximately 15 years. A service contract will be bid out once warranty
periods are over.
The project is on a critical action path because the machines that are currently installed are feared to go
down at any given time and not be repairable. If this would happen, there would be delays in getting
inmate laundry washed and costs associated with remedying the issue in a timely manner.
The project is funded by Capital Emergency Funds.
The schedule of payments is by invoice.

This is a sponsorship for a 30-minute documentary on "The college myth", presented by ideastream. The
documentary offers clear explanations of intricate data, along with insights from experts in the fields of
education, economics, workforce development, and high-growth industries facing labor shortages who
are striving to better align Ohio's education system with the needs of its workforce and economy.
Misconception about Career and Technical Education are contributing to a skills gap and labor shortage
in Ohio and across the nation. The effects will have serious impacts on Ohio's students, workforce, and
economy. American economic growth is highly dependent on the quality and quantity of workers but at
the current production rate, this country will fall short by 5 million workers with appropriate
postsecondary education.
This documentary will raise awareness of the skills gap and labor shortage. Career and Technical
Education could pave the path to a solution.
The Cleveland-Cuyahoga County Workforce Board decided to become a sponsor for this documentary
because career and technical training is an important part of our workforce development system.
ideastream is located in Cuyahoga County and the documentary will be broadcast with WVIZ, WOSU and
WCET.
An RFP exemption is being used as the County is a sponsor for the documentary, WVIZ was seeking
sponsorship to secure their portion of the funds needed to produce the documentary. The request to
31

 become a sponsor for the documentary was evaluated internally and approved based on our funding
availability. This was not competitively bid as this is not an on-going project.

24' logistics truck in 2016 for disaster response capabilities. This forklift nearly completes the logistic
response capability project for the team. The problem for the OHR2 USAR team is managing the logistics
of equipment from the first call to on-scene. The forklift is an important part of meeting response time
and thus response efforts for victims of disaster.
The solution to the problem is the truck-mounted forklift. The machine will efficiently load bulk
equipment and supplies onto the truck and accompany the truck to the scene. The forklift will efficiently
unload the truck and can bring materials over considerable terrain should the truck not be able to reach
the site of command/base camp.
The solution was determined by assessment from the OHR2 USAR team and approved by the Cuyahoga
County Emergency Services Advisory Board (CCESAB), Ohio EMA and FEMA. No other solution was
considered. The vendor was selected following the third formal advertised bid opportunity.
The forklift will be used by the OHR2 USAR team covering Cuyahoga, Ashtabula, Geauga, Lake and Lorain
Counties. The team is capable of responding to a disaster throughout the state of Ohio and can be
deployed as national disaster response asset. Standard 1-year manufacturer's warranty
The purchase is entirely funded by the FY16 Urban Area Security Initiative Grant. Cost of ownership is
incurred by the OHR2 USAR team, with fiscal management through the Cuyahoga County Fire Chiefs
Association.
