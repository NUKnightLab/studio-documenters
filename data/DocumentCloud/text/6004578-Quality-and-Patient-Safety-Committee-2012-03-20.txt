Report from System Chief Medical Officer
Update on the Get Yourself Tested Initiative
Dr. Terry Mason, System Chief Medical Officer, introduced Dr. Ashlesha Patel, of John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital
of Cook County; Dr. Patel provided an update on the activities relating to the Get Yourself Tested (GYT)
initiatives (Attachment #1). The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
Dr. Mason stated that one of the goals previously discussed was to partner with the City of Chicago’s
Department of Public Health to implement a model similar to that used by the City of Philadelphia; under this
type of model, screenings for sexually transmitted diseases would be done for all of the students in the high
schools. He stated that this type of program needs to be done and needs to be funded every year. He added that
it should be started in the high schools; however, he noted that there is data that suggests that perhaps middle
school would also be a good place to implement such a program. When this type of program was previously
discussed, the funding for such a program, just for the City of Chicago, was estimated to cost approximately $3
million per year; Dr. Mason indicated that a program such as this is not cheap, but it is a step in the right
direction.

Report from System Chief Medical Officer (continued)
Director Butler inquired whether this is an area in which other hospitals could participate. Dr. Mason responded
affirmatively. He stated that, in the past, there has been some interest in participation by other hospitals. He
added that support that has been received is episodic; this requires a multi-year effort. Dr. Ansell noted that
Rush is in three school-based clinics; that could be a commitment that Rush could make around those
institutions to do a screening of the students; he added that, as a public health measure, it would be worthwhile
pursuing.
Dr. Linda Rae Murray, Chief Medical Officer of the Cook County Department of Public Health, noted that
reducing sexually transmitted diseases in young people is one of the health priorities of the Cook County
Department of Public Health; she added that small amounts of funding have been received for the purpose of
focusing on enhanced surveillance, which involves tracking down a case and tracking down a network.
Chairman Ansell suggested that Dr. Mason, Dr. Patel and Dr. Murray further review the subject.
Update on North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Summit Preparations
Dr. Mason provided an update on NATO Summit preparations. He stated that the incident action plan for
Stroger Hospital is being prepared. There are a couple of drills that will take place; he added that one of the
issues that is currently being reviewed is a potential use for Provident Hospital for surgery capacity. In addition
to that, from a public health point of view, there will be an increased surveillance for infectious diseases.
Update on Care Coordination Subcommittee for Section 1115 Waiver
Dr. Mason provided an update on the activities of the Care Coordination Subcommittee for the Section 1115
Waiver. He stated that the Subcommittee is looking at the entire organization, to review opportunities for
enhanced or increased capacity, to be able to better deal with the nearly one hundred thousand patients that the
System hopes to enroll. He stated that Frank Borgers, who is representing all of the unions with the exception
of the National Nurses Organizing Committee (NNOC), and Emilie Junge, who is representing the SEIU
Doctors Council, have been involved as the System has moved through this preparation.
A. Update on transition activities for Oak Forest Health Center
Carol Schneider, System Chief Operating Officer, provided the update on the transition activities for the
Oak Forest Health Center. She stated that an Open House event was held at the Oak Forest Campus last
Thursday afternoon; guests invited to the event included elected officials, representatives from area
hospitals, employees and subcommittee members who have been working on the project. She stated that
blueprint drawings were presented; she added that they are very basic and are in draft form. Draft forms of
all of the floors of the E Building were presented as they are envisioned going forward, based on the
availability of future capital. Also presented were the guiding principles regarding the patient care plans for
the campus, and the initial plans for the Imaging Center. Ms. Schneider stated that this information will be
provided in a presentation at the next System Board Meeting on March 29th.

Report from System Interim Chief Nursing Officer
Tanda Russell, System Interim Chief Nursing Officer, provided an update on the subject of bed closures at
Stroger Hospital. As reported to the Committee in January, a significant number of retirements that occurred in
the month of December impacted the nursing units; as a result of this, twenty-four to twenty-eight beds in the
Medical-Surgical units were closed in order to provide safe staffing levels. It was reported at the February
Committee Meeting that fourteen of the twenty-eight beds were re-opened. Ms. Russell provided additional
information on the continuing efforts to recruit nurses; she added that twelve beds currently remain closed.
Ms. Russell noted that at the February Committee meeting, a request was made for the development of a
dashboard for nurse staffing and nursing hours standards; she stated that she is working on the development of
this with Barbara Farrell, System Director of Quality and Patient Safety.

V.

Report from System Director of Quality and Patient Safety
Barbara Farrell, System Director of Quality and Patient Safety, presented her report. She stated that last week, a
bill was sent to the Illinois House Health Care Availability and Accessibility Committee; this bill (HB3772) is
proposing an amendment to revise the existing listing of serious events under the 2005 Adverse Events Health
Care law. She stated that she will continue to provide updates as further information is received.
Ms. Farrell stated that one of the goals related to Quality and Patient Safety was to add a System-wide nursing
quality council; activity on this subject began in January. She stated that this has representation from all of the
affiliates; the goal is to bring more substantive quality-driven initiatives from the front-line nursing staff.
A. Quality report from John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County
Dr. Claudia Fegan, Chief Medical Officer of the John H. Stroger Hospital of Cook County, stated that
presentations from the Department of Trauma and Burns and the Department of Critical Care will be
provided in this report. She provided information on the following three quality-related issues, on which
she and her staff have been working: infusion center – there is an issue with staffing and a large volume of
patients; management of patients with alcohol withdrawal – she stated that the problem is that there needs to
be more rigor in treating it as another diagnosis, rather than just a symptom; and patients with significant
complications of anticoagulation therapy –there is a problem with getting patients in to be seen when they
are in their most vulnerable period, which is the first ninety days of therapy. She provided information on
how these issues were reviewed, and what corrective measures have been taken. Chairman Ansell noted
that for issues such as these, when improvement is achieved, the next year’s quality improvement plan will
reflect this in processes implemented.
Dr. Faran Bokhari, Chair of the Department of Trauma and Burns, presented the Trauma/Burn Quality
Assurance 2011 Report (Attachment #2). Included in the presentation was information on the following
subjects: Encounters by Injury Type; Trauma Dashboard 2011; Burn Center Data 2011; and Future
Directions.
Dr. Fegan presented the report from the Department of Critical Care (included in Attachment #2). Included
in the presentation was information on the following subjects: Critical Care Mortality Data; Example:
Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) Mortality Data 2011; Improving Physician, Nurse, Therapist
Communications – Daily Rounds Sheets; Daily Rounds Sheets Compliance; and Future Plans for Critical
Care.

Recommendations, Discussion/Information Item
A. Reports from the Medical Staff Executive Committees
i. Provident Hospital of Cook County
ii. John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County
Dr. Pierre Wakim, President of the Executive Medical Staff of Provident Hospital of Cook County,
presented a report on the following subjects: Report on Task Force-Increase OP Surgical Cases
(Gynecology); Virtual Bed Update; Next Provident Task Force - Gastroenterology Backlog; and Provident
Hospital’s Role in System Waiver Approval - Inpatient Beds.
Dr. David Goldberg, President of the Executive Medical Staff of John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook
County, presented his report. He stated that the Executive Medical Staff (EMS) meeting was held on March
13th; at this meeting, information technology infrastructure hardware-related issues were discussed. Dan
Howard, System Chief Information Officer, was present at the meeting; this discussion was helpful for EMS
and for Mr. Howard and his team to understand some of the issues.
Dr. Mason noted that Stroger Hospital recently celebrated the 75th Anniversary of the founding of the Blood
Bank by Dr. Bernard Fantus; a number of activities were held to honor this important event.

VII. Action Items
A. Minutes of the Quality and Patient Safety Committee Meeting, February 21, 2012
Director Butler, seconded by Chairman Ansell, moved to accept the Minutes of the
Quality and Patient Safety Committee Meeting of February 21, 2012. THE MOTION
CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

B. Approval of 2012 Quality Improvement Plans for the following:
i. John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County (Attachment #3)
ii. Provident Hospital of Cook County (Attachment #4)
iii. Ambulatory and Community Health Network of Cook County (ACHN) (Attachment #5)
Ms. Farrell presented the three quality plans for the Committee’s consideration and approval. She stated
that there are measures in each of the plans; however, the measures are separated out in the plan for ACHN,
because ACHN is now in the phase of meeting meaningful use requirements, and is also going through an
electronic records upgrade. ACHN is trying to align all of those pieces with what is required from the
Federal government to what is required from the entities with whom it partners.
Chairman Ansell stated that in the future, the quality plans should have a similar format across the entities.
He added that it would be helpful for him to see what is being worked on and why for each of the areas.
Director Butler, seconded by Chairman Ansell, moved to approve the three (3) 2012
Quality Improvement Plans presented. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
C. Any items listed under Sections VI, VII and VIII

Assessment:
At specific intervals, data collected concerning important
aspects, functions, processes of care should be assessed
at the unit level. This includes an analysis of trends and
patterns in the data collected. When a threshold for
evaluations is crossed or negative trend observed, the
evaluation should determine whether there is an opportunity
to improve care or address the problem. When review of care
provided by a practitioner is undertaken, a review by peer
is necessary.
V.

Improvement Action:
In reviewing this information, the responsible unit or
Committee, shall identify opportunities to improve care and
recommend appropriate actions be implemented to improve
care/processes. If a needed action exceeds the authority of
the unit, recommendations are forwarded to the body that has
the authority to act.
Improvement Action Continued:
Such action may include, but are not limited to the
following:
1. Education and training
2. Development and implementation of new or revised policy
and procedures;
3. Staffing changes;
4. Equipment or facility changes;
5. Allocation of administrative resources and support; or
6. Peer review and other performance evaluation procedures
7. Performance Improvement Teams
8. Process redesign
9. Informatics redesign
If a recommendation or corrective action arising from such
Quality Assessment and Improvement activities results in the
alteration and/or suspension of credentialed staff members'
clinical privilege, such recommendation or action is to be
reported to the Medical Director for review.

VI. Evaluation and Documentation of Improvement
After actions have been taken, the QAIC or its
representative shall assess the effectiveness of improvement
efforts. The reevaluation of data occurs at appropriate
intervals as consistent with the severity of the problem.
The assessment or reevaluation of actions taken shall insure
that the action was effective in improving care or resolving
the identified problem and shall be documented and reflected
in the minutes of the QAIC.
Evaluation of the effectiveness of QAIC Program shall be
provided to the Executive Medical Staff and to the Board
16
Page 64 of 105

 through the Joint Conference Committee. The reappraisal
will identify components of the Quality Assessment and
Improvement Program that need to be added, deleted, or
revised. During this evaluation, emphasis will be placed on
the objectives, scope, organization, and overall
effectiveness of the program.
VII. Communication:

 Cook County Health and Hospitals System
Ambulatory and Community Heath Network
Quality Improvement Plan
2012
I. FOUNDATION OF THE CCHHS AMBULATORY QUALITY PLAN
The Cook County Health & Hospitals System (CCHHS) Ambulatory Quality Plan and related quality improvement
activities are created and developed based on the mission and vision of the CCHHS.
The CCHHS AMBULATORY & COMMUNITY HEALTH NETWORK MISSION
To deliver integrated health services with dignity and respect regardless of the patient’s
ability to pay; foster partnerships with other health care providers and communities to
enhance the health of the public; and advocate for policies which promote and protect
physical, mental, and social well being of the people of Cook County.
VISION
In support of its public health mission, CCHHS will be recognized, locally, regionally,
and nationally – and by patients and employees – as a progressively evolving model for
an accessible, integrated, patient-centered, and fiscally responsible health care system
focused on assuring high-quality care and improving the health of the residents of Cook
County.
II. PURPOSE OF THE QUALITY PLAN
• To demonstrate evidence of the commitment of the CCHHS Ambulatory & Community
Health Network (ACHN) to the delivery of quality care.
• To outline the framework and structure for identification, implementation, and
evaluation of improvements for all clinical and support services in the ambulatory
network.
• To establish the reporting and review frameworks that will be used by the Medical
Staff, Nursing, and Ancillary Services to systemically report and review the quality
and appropriateness of care provided at all of the Ambulatory sites.
1

Page 90 of 105

 In order to assure that the CCHHS Ambulatory and Community Health Network is dynamically responding to the ongoing
needs of its patients, staff, and health care delivery system, with the approval of the CCHHS leadership, the plan,
frameworks, and structure of its quality program may need to be modified during the calendar year.
III. GOALS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE CCHHS AMBULATORY COMMUNITY
NETWORK QUALITY PLAN
The overall goal is to facilitate the mission of the CCHHS and to implement the CCHHS Board's goals and objectives in
order to
promote organizational and clinical excellence,
maximize patient safety
provide access to care, and environmental safety
achieve high levels of patient and staff satisfaction
The CCHHS Ambulatory Quality Plan is designed to:
A. Coordinate improvement efforts and projects to ensure that capital, staff, facilities
and technologies are aligned with strategic priorities for performance improvement.
B. Implement a quality program with performance priorities
C. Enable processes and systems that identify and resolve issues and events that may
adversely impact patient care and services throughout the Ambulatory Network.
D. Identify and implement best practices for the provision of safe, cost effective care
and services. Benchmark ambulatory services against similar health care delivery
systems.
E. Meet the expectations of our patients, staff, and other stakeholders to improve and
maintain patient and staff satisfaction.
F. Continually assess and monitor ambulatory performance.
G. Meet accreditation and certification requirements.
H. Support compliance with all regulatory and licensure requirements.
I. Track, trend, and communicate patient care and clinical outcomes.
J. Establish a schedule for reporting of quality measurements, patient care statistics,
and improvement projects.
2

Page 91 of 105

 K. Create an atmosphere of blameless and non-punitive, sustainable
quality improvement.
L. Foster the use of interdisciplinary problem solving throughout the Ambulatory
Community Health Network.
The Quality Plan framework utilizes those qualities and values from the work of the Institute of Medicine (IOM, 2001):
• Safe – avoiding injuries to patients from the care that is intended to help them;
• Effective – providing services based on scientific knowledge to those who
would benefit, and refraining from providing services to those not likely to benefit;
• Patient Centered – providing care that is respectful of, and responsive to,
individual patient preferences, needs, and values and ensuring that patient
values guide all clinical decisions;
• Timely – reducing waits and potential harmful delays;
• Efficient – avoiding waste, including waste of equipment, supplies, ideas, and
energy; and
• Equitable – providing care that does not vary in quality because of personal
characteristics such as gender, ethnicity, geographic location, and
socioeconomic status

IV. SCOPE
To achieve the goal of delivering high quality care, all CCHHS employees are given
the responsibility and authority to participate in the quality improvement program. The
Quality Program includes the following activities:
Data related to the following are collected, analyzed and reported to the appropriate
committees/departments/individuals:
•
•
•

Adverse Events
Adverse Events related to moderate or deep sedation or anesthesia
Significant medication errors
3

Page 92 of 105

 •
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Significant adverse drug reactions
Patient perception of the safety and quality of care
Patient Satisfaction
Employee Engagement
Infection control surveillance and reporting
National Patient Safety Goals
Quality Control related to Lab
Performance measures related to the Environment of Care Management Plans
Other measures as determined by Ambulatory staff and leadership the System

Data related to the required measures and patient safety is measured in a number of
ways including: monitoring of indicators or processes, patient and staff surveys, reported events, root cause analysis, and
other analyses.
V. PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT SELECTION
Selection of opportunities for improvement may include one or more of the following
mechanisms:
• incorporate goals or important functions of the CCHHS ambulatory network
• evaluation of findings from root cause or failure mode effect analysis
• data, from internal or external sources, which indicate performance problems in a
given process and affects a substantial proportion of patients or employees or
represents a substantial risk
• risk management
• external data or feedback from various customer or supplier groups related to the
process
• data indicating performance or resource utilization problems from department quality
improvement activities
Criteria for prioritization include:
• significant potential to improve patient safety
• significant potential to improve the quality of care
4

Page 93 of 105

 • significant potential to increase patient and staff satisfaction
• significant potential to impact efficiency
• significant potential to impact expense or revenue
• processes that cross multiple departments
• advances capabilities to do future improvement projects (such as pilot programs)
• significant potential to achieve strategic goals of system or affiliate
Should there be competition for resources, elective projects will be determined
using a weighted matrix of risk and benefit.
VI Comparative Databases and Benchmarks
The Ambulatory and Community Health Network utilizes comparative databases to incorporate a process for continuous
assessment with similar organizations, standards, and best practices. This assessment can then lead to actions for
improvement, as necessary. Databases that are utilized on an ongoing, routine basis include:
• Illinois Health Connect
• Press Ganey, Inc.
Illinois Comprehensive Automated Immunization Registry (ICARE)
• Centers for Medicare & Medicaid
• Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)
Medical Event Reporting System(MERS)
SQL server
Cerner Power Insight
VII. METHODOLOGY
The methodology utilized for improvement is based on the type of project, goals, timeline and scope. The general method
for quality improvement in the CCHHS Ambulatory Network is the Define, Measure, Assess, Improve, Control, (DMAIC)
approach for improvement activities. The simplest improvement approach will be applied to a problem or issue. The rapid
cycle Plan, Do, Study Act (PDSA) improvement processes are encouraged when feasible and appropriate. The Quality
Plan recognizes that more complex projects with a wide range of services and staff will require a more structured
approach.
