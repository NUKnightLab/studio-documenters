Bulletin Publishing Company ("Law Bulletin") for an amount not-to-exceed $47,016 to allow the
Office of the General Counsel continued necessary access to the Law Bulletin's on-line public court
records including court dockets, case histories and scheduling information.

GENERAL BACKGROUND
The OGC requires on-line services to access case history, court dockets and scheduling
information as it relates to legal matters to support its in-house litigation staff. The CHA has
contracted with the Law Bulletin on a non-competitive basis since 1989 to provide the Office of
the General Counsel access to the public court dockets, case histories and scheduling information.

 The Law Bulletin is the sole source authorized by the court systems to provide private entities with
online access to public court records. On January 1, 2013, after negotiations with the Law
Bulletin, CHA awarded a new contract to them for the base term of January 1, 2013 through
December 31, 2014 for an amount not-to-exceed $88,332, with a priced option for an additional
year for an amount not-to-exceed $47,016. Since the current contract will expire unless CHA
exercises the option term, and the OGC still requires access to the Law Bulletin's on-line public
court records including court dockets, case histories and scheduling information to conduct
litigation on behalf of the CHA, it is in CHA's best interest of the CHA to exercise the Contract's
option year.
The Board action recommended in this item, complies in all material respects with all applicable
Chicago Housing Authority board policies and all applicable federal (HUD) procurement laws.
The Chief Legal Officer concurs with the recommendation to exercise the 1-year option with the
Law Bulletin in the amount of $47,016 for the period of January 1, 2015 through December 31,
2015.
The Chief Executive Officer recommends the Board approve the exercise the 1-year option with
the Law Bulletin in the amount of $47,016 for the period of January 1, 2015 through December 31,
2015.
