Per Commissioner Markowski, the Operations
Committee held its regular meeting on Wednesday, June 11, 2014 at approximately 1:05 p.m. at the 60
3

 E. Van Buren Corporate Offices. Present at the meeting were Commissioners Harris, Reidy,
Washington and Commissioner Markowski. The Committee then discussed, voted and recommended
for board approval the 3 items appearing on the agenda.
On behalf of the Operations Committee, Commissioner Markowski then presented an Omnibus
Motion for the approval of Items 5 through 7.
(Item 5)
The resolution for Item 5 approves an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with the City of Chicago
Department of Administrative Hearing (DOAH) for reports of cases involving alleged City of Chicago
Building Code violations. One of the key priorities of the HCV program is to ensure that all HCVsubsidized units are safe and decent. To this end, HCV conducts annual inspections of all units
subsidized through the program. The inspection criteria that HCV inspectors use are HUD’s Housing
Quality Standards (HQS), which differ in some ways from the Chicago Building Code. Because the
Chicago Building Code and HQS differ, an HCV property could fail an HQS inspection and pass a
building code inspection (or vice versa). Currently, there is no process in place for HCV program
administrators to receive routine notice of building code citations affecting HCV properties and HCV
staff learns of these citations on a case-by-case basis. As such, HCV does not have a full
understanding of how many and which HCV-subsidized buildings are cited for building code
violations and what type of violations are being cited. Through the IGA with DOAH, CHA’s HCV
program administration team will begin to routinely collect information on building code violations
from DOAH’s case records in order to gain a better understanding of the extent of the issue and to
determine if operational changes are needed to address the issue. As the designated administrative
tribunal for building code violation cases, DOAH represents the City of Chicago’s office of record for
violation cases and their ultimate disposition, and DOAH’s records can be utilized to review the
existence and nature of building code violation cases for a given property, as well as each case’s status
or disposition. In the short-term, HCV will assess and analyze the DOAH data records and determine
what, if any, changes need to be made to HCV inspection processes. Depending on the results of the
analysis, a long-term impact might be that HCV would amend its inspection practices or adopt
different inspection standards. HCV anticipates little to no impact on residents and owners in the short
term, while staff are analyzing the data and determining how to use this data to improve the inspection
process. A potential long-term impact is that HCV residents and owners will benefit from better, more
efficient inspection practices.
RESOLUTION NO. 2014-CHA-60
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated June 11, 2014 entitled
“AUTHORIZATION TO ENTER INTO AN INTERGOVERNMENTAL
AGREEMENT WITH THE CITY OF CHICAGO DEPARTMENT OF
ADMINISTRATIVE HEARINGS”;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to
enter into an intergovernmental agreement with the City of Chicago Department of
Administrative Hearings (DOAH) to obtain regular reports from DOAH on building
code violation matters affecting properties in the HCV program.

 (Item 6)
The resolution for Item 6 approves the First Option Year of Contract No. 11304 with Gilbane Building
Company and amends the contract for the current base term for Authority Wide Program Construction
Management Services. In July 2013, CHA executed contract number 11304 with Gilbane Building
Company. The base one year contract with Gilbane will expire on July 9, 2014. The CHA continues
to require the construction and program management services of Gilbane to meet the CHA’s critical
goals for Senior Housing Life Safety/Capital Maintenance, ADA/504 Federal requirements, and
Scattered Sites and Unit acquisition projects for 2014 and 2015. Gilbane's role will be to continue to
support CCD’s “in-house” staff, which is not of sufficient size to handle CHA's projected construction
projects. Therefore, Gilbane has become an integral part of the Capital Construction Department
management team and has provided satisfactory service during its base year, and the continuation of
their construction management services contract continues to be important to the timely achievement
of the CHA’s Plan Forward. Gilbane and CHA have reviewed Gilbane's staffing levels and have
agreed to adjust them accordingly based on the revised number of projected projects. For the base
year, the staffing level increased from 21 to 24 requiring an increase in the contract not-to-exceed
amount for the base term from $3,963,823 to $4,073,583. Further analysis is underway for the
staffing requirements that will be needed for Option Year 1 and an amendment for the Option Year
will be presented at the July 2014 Board meeting. Staff has reviewed the proposed costs, and has
determined that the proposed costs are in accordance with industry standards.
RESOLUTION NO. 2014-CHA-61
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated June 11, 2014 entitled
“AUTHORIZATION TO EXERCISE FIRST OPTION YEAR AND EXECUTE AN
AMENDMENT TO INCREASE THE NOT-TO-EXCEED AMOUNT OF

THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to
execute Amendment No. 1 to Contract No. 11304 with Gilbane Building Company to:
(1) increase the not-to-exceed amount of the base year by $109,760, for the base term;
and (2) exercise the Contract’s Option Year 1 for an amount not-to-exceed $4,083,934,
as set forth in the Contract for the period of 7/10/14 to 7/9/15 to provide Authority Wide
Program/Construction Management Services. The new aggregate total compensation
amount of the Contract will be an amount not-to-exceed $8,157,517

(Item 7)
In February 2014 CHA issued an Invitation for Bid to provide construction services for the renovations
to Caroline Hedger Apartments. The advertisement ran in the Chicago Sun-Times, the Chicago
Defender, Extra, on the CHA website, and on BuySpeed Online. The CHA received and opened 4 bids
on April 15, 2014, and of the bidders, 2 were M/W/DBE vendors. The apparent low bidder was
Madison Construction. Accordingly, the resolution for Item 7 approves an award of contract to
Madison Construction in the amount of the winning bid of $30,437,000 + $1,826,220 in contingency
(6%, which is in line with industry standards) for a total not-to-exceed amount of $32,263,220. Use of
5

 this contingency fund will be subject to the established change order process and will require approval
by the Change Order Committee of the Capital Construction Department. Its use is strictly limited to
change orders justified as due to discovered conditions or code compliance issues. Caroline Hedger
Apartments is a senior development located at 6400 N. Sheridan Avenue. Built in 1973, the building is
26 stories tall, covering 450 unit, and is located in the 49th Ward. In 2008 selected units were
remodeled to meet current accessibility requirements, the community room was completely renovated,
and exterior windows and doors were upgraded. The scope of work for this project consists of site
improvements, (parking lot, entrance driveway, planting/landscaping) and the following building
improvements: replacement windows and façade treatment; mechanical, electrical and plumbing
improvements; new fan coil units, new domestic water lines, new horizontal and vertical sanitary lines,
new kitchen waste lines, new vent lines; new cabinets, countertops, sinks, fixtures, flooring and
appliances; new shower stalls, toilets (as needed), sinks, fixtures, flooring and bathroom accessories;
The Life Safety Program is the CHA’s ongoing commitment to having all of our high-rise buildings
compliant with the city of Chicago’s High-Rise Safety Code. The City of Chicago Code requires fully
sprinkled life safety building systems to be code compliant by January 1, 2017. Life Safety

(Item 8)
The resolution for Item 8 approves a Preliminary Commitment Letter for Property Rental Assistance
for eight units in the development known as Back of the Yards Residences & Dance Studio. This
preliminary letter of commitment will be valid for one year in order to allow the developer to secure
development and construction financing from other sources. Once all financing is secured, the full
development plans will be submitted to CHA Board prior to execution of any contract. The proposed
new development consists of new construction of 6-story elevator building containing 30 units in the
Brighton Park community area consisting of 9 one-bedroom, 10 two-bedroom and 11 three-bedroom
units. Two one-bedroom, 3 two-bedroom and 3 three-bedroom units will be PRA for working
families. Building amenities include a community room and kitchen, a secured entry, laundry
facilities, on-site management and a dance studio on the first floor. The developer, UP Development,
LLC was established in 2007 and has built a team with over 25 years of combined experience in
developing and managing affordable housing. They currently own and operate 484 units in Chicago
and the state of Illinois with an additional 133 units under construction. Back of the Yards
Neighborhood Council (BYNC) was founded in 1939 and is one of the oldest community
organizations in the country. BYNC currently operates 4 retail and industrial Special Service Areas, a
community newspaper, and a range of services for seniors. BYNC’s after school program serves over
300 children and youth which offers tutoring, computer classes and Mexican Ballet Folkloric dance.
The property will be managed by Hallmark & Johnson. It is the intent of the owner/manager of Back
of the Yards Residences & Dance Studio to lease all of the PRA assisted units to eligible working

(Item 11)
In April, 2013, Metra approached the CHA with an interest of purchasing adjacent vacant land located
on the Harry Schneider Senior Apartments development site. Historically, the vacant land has been
used as a garden by the Schneider Apartments residents. Metra’s original request was to purchase

Union Pacific north line’s Peterson and Ridge commuter train station. However, Metra has since
revised its request to acquire CHA land and now desires to purchase 31,672 SF of vacant land.
Improvements to the site will include a paved cul-de-sac, ADA parking, bike racks and outdoor
seating. The site is bounded on the north by Ridge Avenue, on the south by Peterson Avenue,
immediately west by the raised Chicago and Northwestern Railroad tracks. Several community
