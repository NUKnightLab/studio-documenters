PROPOSED RESOLUTION
TO AUTHORIZE THE DISTRICT TO ENTER INTO A LOCAL AGENCY AGREEMENT AND
PAY THE ILLINOIS DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION (IDOT) THE LOCAL SHARE OF
CONSTRUCTION COSTS FOR THE NORTH BRANCH BICYCLE TRAIL SOUTHERN
EXTENSION-STAGE 2
WHEREAS the Forest Preserve District of Cook County (the “District”) has sought, and been awarded,
funds from the Congestion Mitigation Air Quality (“CMAQ”) federal grant program administered by the
Illinois Department of Transportation (“IDOT”) for the construction of a 2.96 mile southern extension of
the North Branch Bicycle Trail (hereafter the “Project”);
WHEREAS, due to the amount of available funding the project will be constructed in two stages: Stage 1
from Devon and Caldwell Avenue to Forest Glen Avenue and, pending available funding, Stage 2 from
Forest Glen to Foster & Kostner Avenues; and
WHEREAS, on October 10, 2014, the Board of Commissioners authorized the District to enter into a local
agency agreement (the “Local Agency Agreement”), with the Illinois Department of Transportation
(“IDOT”) to pay 20% of the Phase III Construction Engineering ($530,000) and total estimated
Construction costs ($6,710,000) associated with the Project; and
WHEREAS, due to increased construction estimates the District requested and was awarded
$1,600,000.00 in additional funds under the Transportation Alternatives program (TAP) program to
supplement the existing CMAQ funds. This increase in federal funding allows for construction of Stage 2
construction.
WHEREAS, to proceed with Stage 2 construction and confirmation of costs “IDOT” requires an additional
Local Agency Agreement. The Local Agency Agreement provides for the division of construction costs
for the Project and payment of 20% of the construction costs to IDOT by the District as the Local Agency;
and
WHEREAS, the grant award was based on an estimated construction cost of $2,000,000.00 of which
IDOT will be responsible for 80% ($1,600,000.00) maximum participation and the Local Agency 20%
($400,000.00); and
NOW, THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that the Board of Commissioners of the Forest Preserve
District of Cook County hereby authorize the District to enter into the Local Agency Agreement and
authorize payment not to exceed 20% or $400,000.00 of the construction cost to IDOT pursuant to the
Local Agency Agreement. The total estimated construction cost for the Project is now $8,710,000 and the
District is responsible for 20% of such amount or $1,742,000.

REPORT
Department: Planning & Development
Request: Receive and File
Report Title: Gateway Master Plan
Report Period: 2015
Summary: The Gateway Master Plan was developed in response to a challenge identified in the Next
Century Conservation Plan that many residents are unaware of forest preserves nearby and have
difficulty finding their way once they arrive. This report identifies 30 special forest preserve sites in
highly visible, high-traffic locations throughout Cook County that have special qualities, access, support
amenities and partnership opportunities. The Plan recommends enhanced signage, way-finding, art and
other amenities, as well as programs and marketing to encourage people to get outdoors and get healthy
at these sites. Major support for the Plan was provided by the Cook County Department of Public Health
through a Partners in Community Healthy (PICH) grant from the federal Center for Disease Control.
