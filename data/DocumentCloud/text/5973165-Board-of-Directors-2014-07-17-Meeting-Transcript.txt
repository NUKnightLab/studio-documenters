CHAIRMAN BELL:

I'd like to call the

2

meeting to order.

I thank everyone for taking

3

the time out to participate in this I think

4

important project and program with us, but we've

5

got a lot to cover today so I'd like to get

6

started right away, Steve, so why don't we just

7

jump right in?

8

MR. BEITLER:

9

CHAIRMAN BELL:

10

MR. BEITLER:

Yes, sir.
Go ahead.

Mr. Chairman, the first

11

order of business is the approval of the

12

June 12th minutes.

16

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Are there any comments,

questions, revisions to the minutes?
(No response.)
Could I have a motion?

17

MS. FERGUSON:

18

ALDERMAN POPE:

Seconded.

19

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Okay.

20

MR. BEITLER:

21
22

So moved.

Passed.

Thank you.

Next I'll turn it over to Vivian
Funches to introduce the audit team.

23

CHAIRMAN BELL:

24

MS. FUNCHES:

Good morning, Vivian.

Good morning.

I would

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 3
1

like to introduce the auditing team that we have

2

for the Trust 12/31/2013 audit.

3

Jeff Dowd with CohnResnick who will then

4

introduce the rest of his name.

The partner is

5

MR. DOWD:

6

name is Jeff Dowd.

7

partner for the Chicago Infrastructure Trust

8

with the accounting firm of CohnReznick.

CohnReznick is a national accounting firm, one

10

Good morning, everyone.

My

I'm the audit engagement

of the largest firms in the nation.

11

As far as this audit goes, the audit

12

here as presented, we'll go a little bit into

13

the results here, but the highlights are that

14

we're issuing an unqualified opinion so we have

15

no modifications to report.

16

The financial statement is that the

17

Trust is in its early stages here so there's

18

really not much to report on.

19

amount of cash and payables we'll go through

20

real quick.

21

We have a small

This is my audit team, Ervin Rabor

22

and Kate Ernst, so they'll go through the

23

presentation real quick.

24

MR. RABOR:

So we're going to start off

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 4
1

with just a rundown of what we're going to talk

2

about.

3

letter, our communications which is our required

4

documentation that we have to provide you under

5

our responsibilities under the Generally

6

Accepted Accounting Standards, and there's

7

certain information related to planned scope and

8

timing of our audit.

We'll go through the status 2014, our

9

Then we'll talk about the numbers

10

and we'll go into the statement of financial

11

position as well.

12

So our qualitative aspects of the

13

accounting practices, we noted no transactions

14

entered into by CIT during the year for which

15

there's a lack of authoritative guidance or

16

consensus.

17

been recognized in the financial statements in

18

the proper period.

19

All significant transactions have

As for management judgment and

20

estimates, we evaluated the key factors and

21

assumptions used to develop these estimates in

22

determining that they are reasonable in

23

relation to the financial statements taken as a

24

whole.

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 5
1

We encountered no significant

2

difficulties in dealing with management in

3

performing and completing our audit, as well as

4

we are pleased to report that there were no

5

disagreements during the course of our audit as

6

well.

7

Any corrected and uncorrected

8

misstatements, none of the audit corrected

9

misstatements detected as a result of the audit

10

procedures were material, either individually or

11

in the aggregate, to the financial statements

12

taken as a whole.

13

these adjustments which are listed in the packet

14

provided.

15

Management has passed on

For any other audit findings or

16

issues, there were no matters of significant

17

discussion that affected our retention as CIT's

18

auditors.

19

So as Jeff said, there isn't really

20

much activity in 2013.

Our audit period

21

consisted of April 24, 2012 through

22

December 31st, 2013.

23

of mostly startup costs as well as

24

organizational costs, meetings and such forth.

That primarily consisted

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 6
1

If we take a look at the statement

2

of financial positions, you know, everything is

3

pretty straight forward.

4

receivable, obviously the Trust's main source of

5

revenue is the City of Chicago grant.

6

there they have to go through a whole entire

7

process to submit these voucher packages in

8

order to pay the vendors and such forth.

9

You know, grants

From

So this is a statement of

10

activities.

11

again is based off of the City of Chicago grant,

12

100 percent of the, you know, activity in 2013,

13

and, you know, this is just a listing of the

14

expenses and total activity as well.

15

The revenue, the grant revenue

If you guys have any questions, you

16

know, I'll be, you know, happy to answer, but

17

again we're in the startup phase.

18

forward to 2014.

19

activity.

20

has any questions.

21
22
23
24

We're looking

There will be a lot more

It's open for discussion if anyone

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Thank you.

Any

questions for the independent audit team?
(No response.)
Thank you.

McGuire's Reporting Service

MR. DOWD:

I just have a couple of

2

things to add.

3

probably one of the simplest audits that you can

4

get to, and obviously you're in a very early

5

startup phase here so there's not much in the

6

way of activity.

7

As far as audits go, this is

There is one thing that I'd like to

8

point out as you look into the future.

9

Recently, about a month ago, the Financial

10

Accounting Standard Board has decided to merge

11

the standards with the International Accounting

12

Standards, and the significance here is that it

13

comes to revenue recognition.

14

As the Trust moves forward and it

15

starts doing projects that happen to have -- the

16

big issue becomes revenue recognition and how we

17

should recognize that revenue.

18

standards in GAAP, it's a very prescriptive

19

method that you have a set of rules that you

20

follow.

21

certain things happened.

22

Under the old

You don't recognize revenue until

Under the Industrial Accounting

23

Standards, it's more liberal, and you follow

24

things that are, you know, how you think that

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 8
1

they should be recognized.

So it's very much

2

subjective in how you do things.

3

The standard doesn't -- you can take

4

early adoption in 2016 and mandatory adoption in

5

2017, so there would be some time before this

6

happens, but it is a pretty major overhaul in

7

how revenue will get recognized in looking in

8

the future.

9

So that's about the only thing I

10

see going forward that would have any impact on

11

the Trust, nothing now but as a role in the

12

future.

13
14

So any other questions, comments or
concerns?

15

CHAIRMAN BELL:

16

MR. DOWD:

17

CHAIRMAN BELL:

18

MS. FUNCHES:

Thank you.

Thank you.
You did a good job.

Now we would like for the

19

Board to approve the audit as it's been

20

reported.

21

ALDERMAN POPE:

Move do pass.

22

MS. FERGUSON:

Move approval.

23

CHAIRMAN BELL:

24

Second.

(A chorus of ayes.)

McGuire's Reporting Service

CHAIRMAN BELL:

2

MS. FUNCHES:

3
4

Good.

We'd like to thank you

guys, CohnReznick, for your presentation.
Moving forward to --

5

(WHEREUPON, discussion was had

6

off the record.)

7

MR. BEITLER:

We got it.

8

MS. FUNCHES:

Page 17, we're on the

9

statement of financial position for the first

10

half of 2014.

11

We took 200,594 in cash and then we have a

12

license, software implementation of 65,000.

13

Those are the large items that affect assets.

14

We have total assets of $314,586.

Our total liabilities, which are all

15

current, is 264,586 with 137,000 being the

16

largest in accounts payable which is the vendor

17

we owe for the software license.

18

total equity which is 50,000 which represents

19

our fees for Retrofit 1.

20

and equity is at 314,586.

21

And then our

The total liabilities

Page 18 is a budget overview.

The

22

auditors presented the first year of 2013 so

23

I'll bypass that, but the first half of 2014

24

we're budgeted at 688,000, and our actual came

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 10
1

in at half of the budget at 345,000 with the

2

respective percentages 94,000 for payroll

3

expenses, 7,000 for finance and audit, 181,000

4

for special feels, insurance 38, and all other

5

is 26,000.

6

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Just a question here.

7

Did we manage to what the City funded or did we

8

manage to what we were trying to get done or did

9

they happen to coincide?

10

MR. BEITLER:

Actually, sir, not really

11

either because in a way we managed the cash

12

flow, so we're spending less than we should be

13

spending, but it was a function at this point of

14

cash in and cash out.

15
16
17

CHAIRMAN BELL:

When you saying we're

spending less than we should be spending -MR. BEITLER:

We should be spending

18

more money on salaries and have more staff, but

19

we didn't have regular cash flows to facilitate

20

that, so we'll transition over time to a

21

full-time work force as opposed to a part-time

22

work force.

23
24

CHAIRMAN BELL:

So in terms of work

accomplished, is it pretty much where you think

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 11
1

we ought to be half way through the year or are

2

we delaying things we ought to be doing?

3

MR. BEITLER:

We're probably delaying

4

some things we ought to be doing, but I'd say we

5

have accomplished an extraordinary amount of

6

work, and I know that everybody works very hard,

7

so I think we've accomplished an extraordinary

8

amount of work.

9

accomplished it in a more easy manner had we had

10
11

We probably could have

regular cash flows.
MS. FUNCHES:

The last column shows our

12

forecast throughout the rest of the year.

13

total annual budget is 1.4 million, and we're

14

looking to come in at 68 to 70 percent of that

15

budget, with 30 percent being salaries,

16

44 percent being professional fees and

17

12 percent being insurance.

18

costs that we're anticipating during the rest of

19

the year.

20

MS. FERGUSON:

The

Those are the large

Vivian, could you just

21

amplify what's the second half professional fee

22

expenditure?

23
24

MR. BEITLER:

Well, basically we --

because we use part-time people, a lot of the

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 12
1

part-timers show up in --

2
3

CHAIRMAN BELL:

It's contract labor

basically.

4

MR. BEITLER:

Right.

5

MS. FUNCHES:

And as we move forward in

6

operations, we're going to start using website

7

design and the other consultants more, software,

8

IT.

9

CHAIRMAN BELL:

You know, it's hard to

10

believe you can double our spend rate in six

11

months.

12

know we're obligated to pay that's a big hitter

13

that's going to happen in the second half.

14

Are there things that today we already

MR. BEITLER:

We're moving into our

15

office next month and we will have some

16

computer, electronics type expenses for moving

17

into the office, and we will have different

18

service expenses, in other words, how we pay for

19

Internet modems and things like that, but those

20

are a one time expense.

21

And then we will also begin to hire,

22

and that will change the profile as well.

Now,

23

the hiring pace is to be determined.

24

number to your point could be lower because we

So the 995

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 13
1

may not be able to hire as rapidly as we would

2

like.

3

hire the right people with the right skills.

4

We don't want to rush it.

CHAIRMAN BELL:

We want to

So the 995 is what the

5

City has available to fund us this year and

6

so --

7
8
9
10

MR. BEITLER:

The City basically has

950 available to fund us this year.
CHAIRMAN BELL:

MR. BEITLER:

12

CHAIRMAN BELL:

13

MS. FUNCHES:

14

CHAIRMAN BELL:

15

MS. FUNCHES:

17
18

And that

shouldn't be a problem getting that?

11

16

Okay.

No.
Okay.

Any other questions?
You're done.

Move on.

Now, I'll turn it back

over to Steve.
MR. BEITLER:

Thanks, Vivian.

So, Mr. Chairman, you had asked for

19

an update on the projects that we've been

20

pursuing and so we've broken that up into three

21

slides on the same two-by-two chart that

22

basically show projects that are discarded,

23

projects that are in-process or approved and

24

projects for the future, and so this is the

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 14
1

first of the three charts.

2

projects that --

3

CHAIRMAN BELL:

This actually shows

Steve, before you do

4

that, let me just talk a little bit about why I

5

asked you to do that.

6

You know, obviously we have to be

7

mindful of the funds we have available to expend

8

over the period we have and we have to make sure

9

we're tracking, you know, what we accomplished

10

with that expenditure, and so what I've been

11

talking to Steve about is that a lot of projects

12

just come into the Trust and we have to have a

13

way to decide as a Board which ones we think we

14

want to go forward with before we expend too

15

much resources, and so that was the whole

16

discussion he and I had and how to best bring

17

that forward and then at least get tacit

18

approval on some of the projects that we think

19

have highest sight.

20

That doesn't mean we can't come back

21

and ask for approval on others, but, you know,

22

he's got a run rate that he's spending money on,

23

and we need to make sure that we're all

24

comfortable with it.

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 15
1

And, by the way, the timelines move

2

on these things pretty quickly.

3

to give the staff some coverage that, you know,

4

they spent money that we're pretty much in

5

agreement that that's the right thing to spend

6

money on.

7

dealing with.

8
9

We have to try

So that's what this discussion is

MR. BEITLER:

So this first chart shows

discarded ideas which doesn't mean that they

10

were bad ideas necessarily, but for one reason

11

or another, perhaps the City wasn't prepared to

12

do something yet, perhaps the idea itself would

13

meet some regulatory hurdle, the financial model

14

didn't turn out or all of the above.

15

So solar would have been on this

16

portion of the chart at one point, but with the

17

passing of a subsidy for the Illinois Power

18

Agency, solar is now back as an active project,

19

so because the financial model can potentially

20

turn out correctly now that there's some subsidy

21

available to get the grid parody.

22

So the projects could move on and

23

off a list depending upon various circumstances,

24

but this is a list of projects that we have

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 16
1

reviewed and discarded for one of the reasons

2

that -- types of reasons that I mentioned.

3

MS. FERGUSON:

So maybe, this is a

4

small point, but maybe discarded is not the

5

right word but deferred.

6
7

MR. BEITLER:

We'll change the

term.

8

MS. FERGUSON:

9

going to pop back on.

10

MR. BEITLER:

11

Yes.

Especially if they're

Right.

So we'll change

that term.

12

MR. RAMIREZ:

Not right.

13

CHAIRMAN BELL:

You got a list of 10,

14

they could either fall to 11, or they could come

15

back in.

16

MR. BEITLER:

That's right.

So then

17

these would be approved or proposed projects,

18

meaning the Board has either approved the

19

project or we would be coming to the Board at

20

some point for approval of these projects, and

21

so we'll spend a little bit of time here.

22

On the upper left hand quadrant you

23

can see Municipal Retrofit 1 which is underway

24

and which we'll give you a brief update on

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 17
1

later, there's a couple of slides, so I'll move

2

on, and the same for aquatic centers that's

3

underway, and we'll give you a brief update on

4

that.

5

CTA 4G we will be presenting today

6

for approval so we'll go through that in some

7

depth in a little bit, and we're looking at a

8

number of alternative energy projects, solar,

9

cogeneration, battery energy storage and

10

waste-to-energy.

11

There's PACE we will go into detail

12

today; streetlights which we are in the process

13

of preparing an RFI for that project which would

14

be replacement of 400,000 streetlights.

15

would become the largest streetlight replacement

16

project ever done.

17

gas which we'll give you a brief update on after

18

these charts as well.

19

which we will go over in executive section.

20

It

And then compressed natural

MR. HOFFMAN:

And then two projects

Steve, quick question

21

about this chart and the other ones.

So, first

22

of all, I commend you and Chairman Bell for

23

putting it together this way.

24

helpful.

I think it's very

I think it's a really good idea, and I

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 18
1

think we will all appreciate this going forward

2

as well.

3

Can you explain a little bit more

4

about the X and Y axis?

5

generate is pretty self explanatory, although a

6

quick explanation about that would be useful,

7

but I'm especially interested in how -- when you

8

say project complexity what you mean and how you

9

think you'll be determining on where that falls

10
11

I think net fees

on the axis.
MR. BEITLER:

Well, the net fees

12

generated is obviously more absolute than

13

project complexity in the sense that project

14

complexity is more of a judgment as opposed to

15

net fees generated where, you know, it's going

16

to generate X fee or Y fee and is that enough.

17

So when we look at projects now, we

18

look in terms of what is the fee that's likely

19

to be generated, what are the costs that are

20

likely to be associated with the project, is

21

there an adequate margin to enable the Trust to

22

become self sustaining because our goal -- we're

23

required to become self sustaining.

24

MR. HOFFMAN:

I just asked in followup

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 19
1

on what that map has decided.

2

I want to ask, when you look at what the fees

3

might be, you're anticipating, I think the

4

project would be X size, the financing would be

5

X amount, and I'm multiplying that by a

6

percentage of what I think would be the

7

percentage of fees that we would receive.

8

understand it right?

9

MR. BEITLER:

Yes.

I'm assuming, but

Am I

We tend to look at

10

market rates for fees to determine in a

11

particular project or a historical rate to

12

determine what would be a likely fee that we

13

would be able to charge and then go through that

14

math exercise.

15

MR. HOFFMAN:

And a fee would be

16

charged to the institution that's providing --

17

the entity that's providing the financing?

18

MR. BEITLER:

Not necessarily.

It

19

depends on the project.

So there could be a

20

transactional fee in the traditional sense of

21

completing a deal transaction, but there could

22

also be a fee -- so in the case of CNG, we might

23

get a fee on every gas gallon equivalent that's

24

pumped, so it would be a different kind of fee

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 20
1

depending upon the project.

There could also be

2

transaction fees in the CNG project.

3

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Which in that case

4

would be borne by the customer?

5

MR. BEITLER:

6

CHAIRMAN BELL:

7

MR. BEITLER:

That's right.
The end user.

So the fees may be

8

different and may be a different combination

9

project by project.

10

In terms of project complexity, it's

11

a little bit of a combination of factors and

12

it's not as absolute as on the fee side.

13

look at things like construction issues or

14

regulatory issues and make a determination, you

15

know, does -- are we doing a project where

16

there's a regulatory regime set up or do we have

17

to create a regulatory regime in order to do

18

that project.

19

So we

Are we doing a project that is

20

fairly standard?

21

do every day or is it some sort of unique

22

construction that people don't do every day?

23
24

Is it construction that people

MR. HOFFMAN:

I think maybe the best

way to answer this, if you can in not more than

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 21
1

a minute because I don't want to take a lot of

2

time, but I see you've got Retrofit 1.0 way up

3

high and aquatic centers much lower.

4

can explain how you see the complexities

5

differently.

6

MR. BEITLER:

Maybe you

Retrofit 1 was the first

7

project, and there was a lot of complexity

8

simply because it was the first project and we

9

had to get everybody on the same page, agree on

10

a transaction methodology.

11

And as I'm saying this, I'm not

12

talking about staff and Board, I'm talking about

13

Trust and City and other parties that

14

participated, the private companies and so on.

15

So there are many, many parties that needed to

16

be involved in order to take that project

17

forward.

18

The aquatics centers is also an ESA.

19

It's the same type of project.

There are some

20

similarities and some dissimilarities.

21

interestingly people are more aware of ESAs

22

because of the work that we've done as the

23

Trust, however, when we did Municipal Retrofit 1

24

we were largely involved with City agencies,

So

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 22
1

city proper.

2

With aquatic centers we're involved

3

with parks and schools, and parks and schools

4

did not go through the same process

5

transactionally as the City went through for

6

Municipal Retrofit 1.

7

So we have a new cast, if you will,

8

of people who need to become acquainted and

9

taken through all the eccentricities of this

10

type of transaction which creates some

11

complexity, even though having done one already

12

that reduced complexity.

13

judgment as to where it falls onto the graph.

14

CHAIRMAN BELL:

So then we're making a

So it sounds like that

15

the way you make that determination, it talks

16

about the degree of difficulty the Trust is

17

going to have putting the deal in place as well

18

as the project itself because if you looked at

19

Retrofit 1, if it's the tenth project, it

20

probably wouldn't have that degree of

21

complexity.

22

MR. BEITLER:

23

CHAIRMAN BELL:

24

That's correct.
The project itself was

not that complicated.

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 23
1

MR. BEITLER:

It would not.

In fact,

2

in both of these projects, the physical

3

construction that will occur, there's nothing

4

unique about it.

5

construction all the time.

6

little complexity from a construction standpoint

7

for either project.

People are doing this kind of
So there's very

8

MR. HOFFMAN:

Thank you.

9

MR. BEITLER:

You're welcome.

10

So then potential projects, there

11

are several that we'll discuss in the executive

12

session and then there are two that we're

13

investigating.

14

One interestingly as we were working

15

with the CTA on 4G for the subways, the carriers

16

suggested looking at putting 4G in the Pedway in

17

the City, so we'll be looking at that project.

18

And then we're also looking at larger municipal

19

retrofits.

20

So in this particular case for

21

schools, for example, the aquatics center

22

project, which is half schools, will serve as an

23

analytical basis for looking at a larger

24

retrofit at schools.

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 24
1

We're also investigating Water

2

Department liens to determine how we can do

3

these projects within the framework of the

4

paperwork that we have to analyze to figure it

5

out.

6

So with that, I'll ask Claire to

7

take us through Retrofit 1 and we'll move onto

8

some other projects after that.

9

you need to change the slide.

10

MS. TRAMM:

11

Okay.

Just tell me if

Sounds good.

Just to summarize again,

12

Retrofit 1 is now underway.

13

closed March, April of this year and is actually

14

breaking ground in late July in 60 buildings or

15

"breaking ground" in the sense that we are

16

upgrading buildings, not building new ones.

17

That transaction

And then next slide, please, Steve,

18

this is the proposed score card.

19

here because, in fact, at this time we just

20

received our first invoices from our project

21

manager, the PBC, so all of the funds have not

22

yet been deployed and we will commence being

23

deployed later this July.

24

I put proposed

And then in terms of projects under

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 25
1

way, we're getting through the change order

2

management process and all of the pre approvals

3

that 2FM had to negotiate with the ESCOs and

4

PBC, so that sort of wraps up here in late July.

5

It takes a couple months to do that stuff before

6

you can actually get in buildings.

7

So again projects are on track,

8

funds are on track but not underway yet.

9

a quick update on Retrofit 1.

10

Next slide, please, Steve.

That's

So the

11

transaction that was approved in our last

12

meeting is the aquatic centers upgrade or

13

Retrofit 2.

14

underway in both schools and parks with Level 1

15

energy audits.

16

We are, I'm pleased to say,

So we have our selected firm,

17

Siemens, actually walking the grounds as they've

18

started over the past few weeks and both sister

19

agencies to take a look at what are -- basically

20

a quick look, not a full investment grade audit,

21

but a quick look at what are likely the cost

22

effective upgrades in all 141 buildings with

23

pools in them owned by the schools and parks.

24

We've also kicked off a contracting

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 26
1

work stream and are beginning negotiations with

2

Siemens Financial Services as well as schools

3

and parks about how their boards need to approve

4

these kinds of things, what are their concerns

5

and conditions that they want to include in the

6

contract in various phases.

7

Page 26, Steve, this just talks

8

about exactly where we are so I'll highlight

9

July which is in red going forward.

Right now

10

we expect the Phase 1 audit to be completed

11

sometime in August, and then we hope to bring

12

two documents for the school board and parks

13

Board approval sometime late August, September.

14

One is the contingent investment

15

grade audit so it allows them to go forward with

16

the full engineering services and if they -- at

17

the end of that full engineering review in

18

sometime like December, which it takes three or

19

four months, at the end of that if they decide

20

not to move forward with the project, they're on

21

the hook essentially for compensating Siemens

22

for their time for doing those deeper

23

engineering reviews, and secondly, the

24

intergovernmental agreement with us.

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 27
1

So everything is on track there and

2

we're getting a lot of support.

3

seems like there's going to be plenty of

4

opportunities in schools, and we're still

5

interested to see how the Phase 1 audits come

6

out on parks facilities because they, as a parks

7

and sustainability minded organization, had

8

taken the advantage of a lot of the low hanging

9

fruit already.

10

Offhand it

So that's where we're at on

pools.

11

CHAIRMAN BELL:

On the pool part, do we

12

still have to negotiate what our fee is on this

13

project?

14

MS. TRAMM:

15

CHAIRMAN BELL:

16

Yes.

Yes.

And who do we negotiate

with?

17

MR. BEITLER:

It's a transactional fee

18

so it will be with the three parties to the

19

contract, pools, schools -- parks, schools and

20

Siemens.

21

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Okay.

And are we --

22

have we entered into those discussions, so do we

23

have a sense of what we're going to end up here

24

yet?

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 28
1

MR. BEITLER:

Well, we're anticipating

2

a standard fee based on similar types of

3

transactions.

4
5

CHAIRMAN BELL:
What about it --

6

MR. BEITLER:

7

CHAIRMAN BELL:

8

MR. BEITLER:

9

CHAIRMAN BELL:

10

Standard fee of what?

MS. TRAMM:

Up to 1 percent.
1 percent?

Yes.
Thank you.

So without any further

11

questions on pools, let's review streetlights

12

which is the next slide, Steve.

13

So streetlights, we're actually in

14

the draft phases of our RFI and bouncing the

15

draft around now internally before we get to the

16

City and some of the stakeholders there that

17

will review it.

18

The goal again is retrofit the

19

City's 400,000 outdoor streetlights which would

20

be the largest project of its kind in the world

21

were we to actually find it cost effective to

22

replace all of these streetlights, but all of

23

them are currently in play and under review, and

24

I think we are very optimistic that the, you

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 29
1

know, Efficiency Service Agreement or ESA

2

contract structure will help us and be

3

applicable for this kind of a project.

4

in addition to the City, are the two agencies or

5

departments in play and both are very eager to

6

see this happen.

7
8
9
10
11

Parks,

So Page 28 just shows -CHAIRMAN BELL:

So today we're able to

isolate the cost of the lighting throughout the
City as 400,000 lights?
MS. TRAMM:

So the City has a very

12

detailed inventory of the lights and we're

13

working on getting the actual cost for all the

14

different myriad actual lights because there

15

are, as you can imagine, many different types of

16

bulbs and lighting structures.

17
18

CHAIRMAN BELL:

So that's the cost of

replacement?

19

MS. TRAMM:

Yeah.

20

CHAIRMAN BELL:

I'm more interested in

21

knowing today does the City have the ability to

22

isolate what the energy cost is associated with

23

running all those lights?

24

MS. TRAMM:

Oh, yes.

We're good with

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 30
1

that.

2

CHAIRMAN BELL:

So we'll have a clear

3

objective way to know that we're making the

4

same --

5

MR. BEITLER:

6

MS. TRAMM:

Yes, we do.

Yes.

We've got most of

7

that data in.

We're making sure we're releasing

8

that as part of the RFI so we can get maximally

9

helpful responses to the RFI.

10

MR. BEITLER:

The time spent on the RFI

11

really has not been in writing the RFI, it's

12

been in collecting that data.

13

MS. TRAMM:

So development timeline for

14

this, we hope to issue the RFI --

15

CHAIRMAN BELL:

16

MR. SILVERS:

I'm sorry.

Damon?

Just a quick question

17

about this.

18

corner, the platform, how are you thinking about

19

designing the RFI in relation to that broader --

20

that potentially broader mandate?

21

That little thing down in the

Are you thinking about these in

22

stages or are you thinking we're going to go

23

with this whole package?

24

MS. TRAMM:

The way we're thinking

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 31
1

about it in terms of the RFI draft itself are

2

sort of in two parts; one, talking about

3

upgrading the infrastructure to make it more

4

efficient; and then the second is what else can

5

you do besides just making it more energy

6

efficient.

7

So whether it's automated metering,

8

whether it's solar on top of the streetlights,

9

whether it's video, et cetera, what else can you

10

do.

11

essentially list the things we heard of at least

12

comprehensively in a mutually exclusive,

13

collectively exhaustive sort of list and say if

14

you have anything that falls into these

15

categories, let us know.

16

doesn't fall into categories, let us know, and

17

we'd be very interested to hear what's out

18

there.

19

And what we're going to try and do is

Also, you know, if it

And then the way we think about this

20

in terms of as we move towards the RFP stage,

21

which on the next page we're hoping to happen by

22

the end of this year, we moved to RFP, we'd like

23

to review all of those ideas about a platform

24

uses of the streetlights as well as the energy

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 32
1

efficiency economics of these various categories

2

of lighting that are within our overall system

3

because we may phase a project, for instance, to

4

pull a few of the very synergistic projects that

5

come from the platform side into the Phase 1 of

6

the streetlights or, for instance, as we're

7

going through the streetlight energy efficiency

8

upgrades, we may want to enable certain aspects

9

of the platform so that later we can go back and

10

decide for sure do we want to add these elements

11

to our platform.

12

So we sort of need to take -- hear

13

what we got or see what we get back in terms of

14

responses and then think about how these

15

contingencies over time will play out because

16

the first step in this has to be mindful I think

17

of some of the later decisions and phases and

18

capabilities that the infrastructure needs to

19

have.

20

MR. SILVERS:

Could I just make a

21

comment about this?

There is an enormous sort

22

of opportunity in this kind of thing.

23

think Claire was alluding to, there's a lot of

24

path dependency.

As I

If you lock into an

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 33
1

obsolescent technology at the beginning --

2

CHAIRMAN BELL:

3

MR. SILVERS:

You get lemons.

-- you're going to be

4

stuck with it in that case.

5

huge -- streetlights themselves are relatively

6

straight forward in terms of the kinds of things

7

that the Trust is seeking to do and the issues

8

involved, pretty simple.

9

There's also

When you take advantage of all of

10

these opportunities then you're into a series of

11

rather complex public policy issues, and so I'm

12

not suggesting to the Board that we ought to shy

13

away from that because the potential is so

14

great, but we just need to be thoughtful about

15

the public policy issues that then arise as you

16

go on.

17

MS. TRAMM:

Yeah, I think what we'll

18

try and do after the RFI is try and lay out in

19

somewhat of a two by two, right, the project

20

complexity on the Y axis on those previous

21

slides.

22

what are the other things besides economics,

23

what are the other axes on which we want to

24

evaluate some of these other platform

I think we need to think in terms of

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 34
1

opportunities.

2

MR. HOFFMAN:

If I may.

What is the

3

timing on when you expect the RFI to go out, and

4

if you have a timeline -- There you go.

5

you.

6

you have thought about the RFP?

7

Thank

When would you expect responses, and if

MS. TRAMM:

We're hoping the RFI can

8

get out by July, August, although it looks like

9

the City just moved a meeting, a key meeting

10

that we need to have before it goes out until

11

mid August, so that may get pushed back now

12

until the end of August when we issue it.

13

I would expect we're going to give

14

the private sector four to six weeks to respond

15

and make sure that this goes out to as broad an

16

array of potential respondents as possible, and

17

then I would expect another probably 6 to

18

12 weeks internally spent reviewing and then

19

syndicating and talking about the strategy with

20

the various stakeholders of the City and Park.

21

MR. HOFFMAN:

When the RFI goes out, to

22

Damon's point, will you send a copy to the Board

23

and the Advisory Board?

24

thinking about the points that Damon has alluded

I think reading it and

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 35
1

to would be helpful.

2

MS. TRAMM:

Absolutely.

3

MR. HOFFMAN:

4

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Thank you.
And who would make the

5

decisions as to what enhancements we would be

6

looking at?

7

standpoint, it would appear we would sort of be

8

limited to the efficiency approval.

9

I mean, from the Trust's

MR. BEITLER:

Well, there's a very

10

senior group of executives at the City who are

11

involved in these meetings that Claire was

12

alluding to, and we have been interviewing all

13

of the departments in the City to see what their

14

requirements are.

15

There are certain departments whose

16

requirements are more preeminent than others.

17

So, for example, the Police Department has some

18

specific requirements that would probably be

19

important to incorporate, and then there are

20

other things that we could do on the lights that

21

are more discretionary, if you will.

22

So to give you an example, the

23

police often plug their command centers into the

24

base of the light to get power, so when we redo

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 36
1

these, they have to still be able to plug their

2

command center into the base of the light, and

3

they'd like to be able to plug it into more

4

bases of lights rather than the limited numbers

5

that are available today.

6

So there would be that kind of

7

requirements and then there would be

8

discretionary --

9

CHAIRMAN BELL:

10

paid back by efficiency.

11

does that --

12

MR. BEITLER:

So that doesn't get
That's the point.

How

Well, all four cellular

13

carriers would like to put cellular nodes onto

14

the streetlights, and that would, in turn,

15

significantly subsidize some of the other

16

activities that would occur.

17

So one of the things that we have to

18

look at as we go forward is which activities are

19

revenue generating and how do they subsidize

20

other activities that may not be revenue

21

generating but may be a requirement, and simply

22

changing the light pole and saving energy may

23

not subsidize the full cost of all of those

24

requirements.

MS. BARRETT:

3

CHAIRMAN BELL:

4

MS. BARRETT:

Okay.

Chairman Bell?
Yes.

Just a quick followup to

5

Damon's question.

Because this is such an

6

emerging field, kind of that nexus of urbanism

7

and technology, there's a lot of great minds

8

connected to the Trust.

9

innovation that we would get through the RFI

There's a lot of

10

process, but then there are others.

11

whole just kind of entrepreneurial community.

12

There's the

I'm wondering if there's some way we

13

can build in tapping into some of the

14

innovations, exchanges, Agent 71, Chicago

15

Innovation Exchange, et cetera just to explore

16

the possibility.

17

MR. BEITLER:

We're actually already

18

anticipating throughout the country, and this

19

will be the first project for which we do a full

20

scale PR component because there is such a large

21

community out there that is innovating in terms

22

of lighting.

23
24

So there are light bulbs now that
can change brightness based on phases of the

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 38
1

moon.

I mean, there's just all kinds of

2

products out there now, and some of them are by

3

startups and some are not.

4

We do have to be a little bit

5

careful though.

6

and it's a very significant project, and it

7

seems to me to be not very likely that some

8

small startup is going to -- they might be able

9

to be a subcontractor but --

10

This is a very large project,

MS. BARRETT:

I'm not thinking so much

11

as bidders but as things that we want

12

information on.

13

to ask for on parking management, for example,

14

but that could be a revenue generator.

15

You know, we may not know what

MR. BEITLER:

This will be the first

16

project where we do a full PR approach to the

17

project to try to reach out as broadly as

18

possible to accomplish exactly.

19

CHAIRMAN BELL:

20

MR. RAMIREZ:

Jorge?

Yeah, I just think this

21

is the kind of project that the Trust should be

22

looking at.

23

you know, understanding what the concerns are

24

and just handling it straight on, but I like

I think we should run to this and,

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 39
1

that we're not digging up things and stuff like

2

that, yet creating essentially a network,

3

potential for a network as well.

4

And I think it would -- a lot of

5

folks would have a lot of interest in this,

6

folks that are, I'll speak for myself, much

7

smarter than me, will look at this and see the

technological advantages that this can bring for

9

the next generation ideas and things in terms of

10

communications and how things operate in the

11

system.

12

This would end up being a great

13

experiment I think and a great feather in our

14

caps to move in this direction.

15

one.

16

MS. TRAMM:

Okay.

It's a good

Well, thank you all

17

for your comments on the energy project.

18

turn it over to Nick to talk about CNG.

19

MR. EPSTEIN:

I'll

I'm going to give a brief

20

update on the compressed natural gas program.

21

We introduced this idea a few months ago, and we

22

have been doing some more exploratory work on

23

this project.

24

And the basic idea here is that

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 40
1

compressed natural gas is a much cheaper, much

2

more environmentally friendly fuel than gasoline

3

and diesel, and the reason why you don't see

4

more adoption among municipal fleets and private

5

fleets is that there is a lack of fueling

6

infrastructure.

7

The fueling providers who own

8

stations are hesitant to build that

9

infrastructure because they're not sure who's

10

going to come and fuel at their stations, and

11

the private fleets and the municipal fleets are

12

afraid to make the investment in natural gas

13

vehicles because they're unsure if they'll be

14

able to acquire the necessary fuel to power

15

their vehicles.

16

MR. BEITLER:

The chicken and the egg.

17

MR. EPSTEIN:

The chicken and the egg,

18

right.

19

We have been working with Fleet and Facility

20

Management.

21

next page.

22

So we've been meeting for months now.

Steve, if you want to go to the

We have been conducting what we call

23

a listening tour.

We've been meeting with Fleet

24

and Facility Management to develop a natural gas

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 41
1

vehicle acquisition plan that we think will

2

maximize the potential cost savings for the

3

City.

4

2FM actually recently acquired

5

seven natural gas refuse trucks that they're

6

unsure if the City owned CNG fueling

7

infrastructure will be able to properly fuel

8

these new vehicles, so they have a definite

9

interest in a privately financed public access

10

station, network of stations that we're looking

11

at facilitating.

12

We have also spoken to six or seven

13

private sector fleets, large corporate fleets in

14

Chicago that are interested in pursuing this

15

program that if we were able to get a network of

16

stations built that they would make the

17

investments in acquiring natural gas vehicles.

18

So the idea here is that we

19

essentially line up enough demand to incentivize

20

one or more natural gas fueling providers to

21

make an investment and build a number of

22

stations, and we are expecting submission of one

23

or more unsolicited proposals from natural gas

24

fueling providers I think at the end of the

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 42
1

month who are interested in being the fueling

2

provider for this program.

3

stands.

4

CHAIRMAN BELL:

That's where that

Well, how do we deliver

5

the demand though?

6

have to have some of these fleets sign up?

7

I mean, how do we -- Do we

MR. BEITLER:

Well, the City fleet

8

would be the first fleet that would enable us to

9

do that.

10
11
12

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Would that be

sufficient enough as far as that goes?
MR. BEITLER:

The savings -- we're

13

working on jointly a model with the City and the

14

savings potentially looks significant, so it

15

seems like there would be a very good reason for

16

the City to convert the model focused initially

17

on light duty vehicles which is actually not the

18

sweet spot.

19

So we believe that when we focus on

20

heavy duty vehicles, which is the sweet spot,

21

that there will be even greater savings, and we

22

will put together a plan to convert City

23

vehicles, and the station providers would, in

24

turn, build stations.

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 43

MR. HOFFMAN:

I have some really basic

2

probably dumb questions.

3

which is not a hybrid, can't -- just a regular

4

car cannot run on CNG unless there's some

5

conversion that takes place?

6
7

10

MR. BEITLER:

Or you purchase a CNG

MR. HOFFMAN:

Does the City currently

vehicle.

8
9

Regular -- my car

have a significant fleet of CNG equipped
vehicles?

11

MR. BEITLER:

Interestingly, the

12

suburbs do, but the City does not because the

13

filling stations don't exist in the City for the

14

most part, but they do in suburban areas.

15

MR. HOFFMAN:

Moving in this way, if

16

we can be the catalyst to help the chicken and

17

egg problem, great.

18

going to be alive for years and work, that's

19

great.

20

If it's a technology that's

One, again, you know, possibly

21

uninformed concern or question would be, you

22

know, we see a lot more electric cars, so we

23

sitting here won't be able to have the knowledge

24

of the future in what technology would become

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 44
1

dominant in two years or five years from now.

2

So one concern would be that we're

3

helping the City move in a direction that

4

ultimately will be wasteful because two to five

5

years from now someone is going to say why did

6

you go to CNG, it's all electric now, even for

7

buses.

8

develop.

We don't know how the technology will

9

So this is not an effort to throw

10

cold water on it, but it's an effort to ask

11

are we sort of potentially moving toward

12

building --

13

MR. BEITLER:

We actually do know how

14

the technology will develop though, and we're

15

aware of what the timelines are.

16

with, as part of this project, with several

17

truck manufacturers, with several vehicle

18

manufacturers.

19
20

MR. HOFFMAN:

We're working

So what is the answer on

the timeline?

21

MR. BEITLER:

15 years, maybe longer.

22

MR. HOFFMAN:

15 years there is

23

confidence that CNG is actually going to be a

24

useful and most efficient alternative fuel?

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 45
1

MR. BEITLER:

Yes.

2

CHAIRMAN BELL:

And that's only because

3

of the big find of Shell Gas lately that says

4

that we have this managed in the U.S. for years

5

to come, if we don't give it away.

6

other caveat.

That's one

We can very well do that.

7

MR. HOFFMAN:

Fracking dependent.

8

MR. EPSTEIN:

CNG is about $2 cheaper

9

on a gallon of gasoline equivalent than the --

10

MR. RAMIREZ:

Could you repeat that?

11

MR. EPSTEIN:

CNG is $2 cheaper on a

12

gallon of gasoline equivalent as the unit of

13

measurement.

14

MR. BEITLER:

This can potentially be

15

an extremely important program for all levels of

16

business because a small business owner who owns

17

say five Ford F150 pickup trucks, Ford makes all

18

their F150 trucks now as CNG trucks, so you

19

could actually convert your vehicles as a small

20

business owner, say you own a small construction

21

firm, to CNG F150s and start saving $2 a gallon

22

which would very quickly add up.

23
24

So this is not only a program for
the Fed Exes of the world or city fleets but

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 46
1

also for our small business person in the City,

2

and there are some vehicle manufacturers now who

3

are building commercial sedans, so, you know, a

4

small four passenger vehicle that you can

5

purchase as an OEM CNG vehicle now.

6

So as just residents of the City

7

you can purchase a CNG vehicle and save a

8

significant amount of money on filling up at the

9

pump.

10

MR. HOFFMAN:

Sure, or you can have an

11

electric car and you're having troubling

12

figuring out where to charge it, is it easy to

13

bolt onto this project -- we're potentially

14

putting stations together, is it easy to bolt on

15

to that project that 5 or 10 percent of the

16

space is also available for members of the

17

public to charge their car?

18
19
20

MR. BEITLER:

We are looking exactly at

that potential.
CHAIRMAN BELL:

I guess the thing

21

though is that -- because I think people wonder

22

why now are we all of a sudden talking about

23

natural gas.

24

we just realized we have this big reserve in the

It's because of the advantage that

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 47
1

U.S., and that's why it's on the table, and

2

that's why it's now competing with electrical

3

because it's cheap.

4

MR. BEITLER:

We actually went over the

5

demand curves about two board meetings ago so I

6

can now forward you the demand curves.

7

MR. SILVERS:

Mr. Chairman, I just want

8

to followup on your point about if we don't give

9

it away.

10

CHAIRMAN BELL:

11

MR. SILVERS:

Yes.

Just to say to the Board

12

that, you know, David's point about, you know,

13

add on electric stations I think is a very fine

14

point, but the thing we really got to watch out

15

for on this, which is in every -- as far as I

16

can see a fine project and it will do exactly --

17

if successful, will do what was just being

18

discussed which is you get a critical mass that

19

will then enable all kinds of people to dock on,

20

but the critical issue is to the extent that

21

payback for that financing is long-term, you

22

really got to have a clear understanding of the

23

long-term trajectory of natural gas prices, and

24

the impact of two things, one is the plans for

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 48
1

exporting and globalizing the price which I

2

think, Mr. Chairman, was your point.

3

CHAIRMAN BELL:

4

MR. SILVERS:

Yeah.

Got it.

And the other is that

5

what the pricing factor is going to be of

6

everyone behaving the way that we're behaving.

7

You know, you've got natural gas prices being

8

set by a certain type of usage.

9

up electric power use of natural gas.

We're ramping
We're

10

ramping up a lot of things.

11

long term and we've got to look at whether

12

there's ways in which the Trust can layoff the

13

risk.

14

MR. BEITLER:

We got to think

Just to be clear, by

15

doing this program in this manner, it is

16

possible to enter into long-term supply

17

contracts at particular prices.

18

MR. EPSTEIN:

That's the risk, correct.

19

MR. SILVERS:

That's what I'm getting

MR. BEITLER:

So that is a definite

20
21

at.

22

component of this program that would benefit the

23

City in a very specific manner for an extended

24

period of time.

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 49
1

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Well, I mean, to me the

2

key risk is being able to deliver that critical

3

mass initially and guarantee that to the

4

provider station.

5

MR. BEITLER:

So a station provider is

6

generally willing to build a station on the

7

basis of 30 converted vehicles being available

8

in the vicinity of that station, so they just

9

view that as sort of the startup number of

10

vehicles necessary, and at this point in the

11

light duty City fleet alone, there's 4,000

12

potential vehicles to run.

13

CHAIRMAN BELL:

I just don't know what

14

that cost is and if the City has the money and

15

will they --

16

MR. BEITLER:

There would actually be a

17

significant savings.

We're running through the

18

model at this point.

The savings look

19

excellent.

20

CHAIRMAN BELL:

21

MR. BEITLER:

Okay.

So now we'll move into

22

our first project for which we will be asking

23

the Board to vote.

24

MR. EPSTEIN:

So the CTA in November of

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 50
1

last year, John Flynn, the CTA's chief

2

technology officer, reached out to the Trust to

3

ask if we could help them assist in identifying

4

alternatives and cost effective financing for a

5

new 4G distributed antenna system for the

6

Chicago subways.

7

A 4G DAS, the installation will

8

allow for high speed 4G wireless access in the

9

City's 24 miles of subway, tunnels and stations.

10

Prior to our involvement, the CTA was planning

11

on either issuing debt to pay for the project or

12

paying for it through their capital improvement

13

budget and directing the funds from other

14

projects such as buying new railcars.

15

After we were engaged -- I'll go to

16

the next slide.

17

demographics on the Blue and Red Lines so you

18

get an idea of the population that would benefit

19

from an upgraded wireless cellular architecture

20

in the subways.

21

Here is just some basic

We also did some statistical

22

analysis and calculated what we think the total

23

demand in ridership, the growth in ridership

24

over the next 15 years based on growth in the

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 51
1

last ten years, and we think that the Red Line

2

will be between a little over a billion,

3

1.2 billion riders and on the Blue Line between

4

670 and 814 million riders cumulatively over the

5

next 15 years.

6

rail system.

7

This slide is for the entire

We also calculated what we call

8

network demand times.

So if you think about a

9

passenger waiting for 10 minutes for a subway

10

train and then traveling on the train for 15

11

minutes, that's potentially 25 minutes that they

12

could be using a mobile device, so we calculated

13

the total wait and travel segments, multiplied

14

that by the expected ridership growth, and this

15

is the total amount network demand hours for

16

mobile devices that we think are going to grow

17

in the next 15 years as well.

18

MR. RAMIREZ:

It's depressing.

19

MR. BEITLER:

One of our attorneys is

20

very excited about being able to bill in 15

21

increments.

22

MR. EPSTEIN:

And here is projected

23

network demand time for the entire CTA rail

24

system.

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 52
1

So overall we thought that there was

2

a great case for private businesses to make the

3

investment instead of the CTA for this project.

4

There are several billion riders projected to be

5

using the subways in the next 10 to 15 years

6

when 4G is still a viable technology, and

7

hundreds of millions of hours of projected

8

demand time.

9

We did months of research looking at

10

how these projects were financed in other

11

cities, and what we discovered is that in one

12

form or another the Metra authorities in the

13

various cities have approached the wireless

14

carriers to collectively fund the system because

15

they're not just subway passengers, but they are

16

cellular customers and the cellular -- the

17

wireless companies want to provide optimal

18

service no matter where their customers are.

19

So there were two basic models that

20

we found that had worked in other cities.

One

21

is a third party model where a wireless or a

22

Metro authority would enter into a contract with

23

the third party to design, build and finance the

24

entire DAS system and then enter into individual

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 53
1

contracts with the wireless carriers to get

2

capital and licensing funds.

3

And then the second model is what we

4

call the wireless consortium model where the

5

wireless carriers come together as a business

6

consortium and directly engage the Metra

7

authority to design and build the system and

8

provide the financing.

9

CHAIRMAN BELL:

This is the thing that

10

I'm always trying to figure out on this project.

11

So the revenue creating end of it for us in the

12

City is that we provide the capability for them

13

to have our riders spend more time on their

14

system which would provide more revenue for

15

them, and we charge them a fee for that, is that

16

it?

17

MR. BEITLER:

The CTA would charge them

18

a fee for it, yes, sir.

19

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Or a fee for it.

Part

20

of the fee though would it be -- the carriers

21

will make the initial investment to put it in

22

place, but part of going forward we'd have to

23

maintain it at some certain level?

24

MR. BEITLER:

Well, some of these

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 54
1

things are to be determined such as who does

2

what maintenance, but basically there's two

3

major components.

4

avoidance and the other is licensing fee.

5

basically instead of the CTA paying to install

6

the system, the carrier is paying to install the

7

system.

8

One is capital expense

CHAIRMAN BELL:

So

Why would the CTA ever

9

pay to do it anyway?

10

the rider experience?

11

MS. BARRETT:

Correct.

12

MR. BEITLER:

Yes.

13

MR. RAMIREZ:

They can charge on the

14
15

I mean, just to improve

back end though.
CHAIRMAN BELL:

But if they just did

16

that without the carriers, they wouldn't charge

17

the riders for having Wi-Fi, would they?

18

MR. BEITLER:

No.

The riders would

19

still approach that system through their

20

carriers through the phone that their carriers

21

provide them.

22

MR. EPSTEIN:

There's also a public

23

safety aspect of first responders having access

24

to more of the network in the subways.

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 55
1

CHAIRMAN BELL:

2

MR. EPSTEIN:

Okay.

So the CTA by the time we

3

had gotten involved had already issued a -- gone

4

through their RFI, RFQ, RFP process to select

5

the contractor to perform the design, build and

6

install work.

7

We then entered into an engagement

8

contract with the CTA and then we were

9

authorized to go out and pursue the financing

10

for this project.

11

So from late April through June we

12

met with the four major wireless carriers, AT&T,

13

Sprint, T Mobile and Verizon.

14

with our research and we asked them to

15

participate in the project by collectively

16

funding the upfront capital expenditures.

17

We presented them

In the last week we received a

18

commitment, nonbinding statement of principals

19

where the carriers have agreed to fund, pending

20

further negotiations, the full cost of the

21

system.

22

So again the CTA was planning on

23

paying for it themselves in one form or another,

24

and now we're getting it 100 percent financed by

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 56
1

the carriers pending consensus on the design of

2

the system.

3

CHAIRMAN BELL:

So would the CTA

4

consider that a win even if they didn't get an

5

annual fee?

6
7
8
9
10

MR. HOFFMAN:

I would hope so.

But, I

mean, it's a good question.
CHAIRMAN BELL:

Or do we also have to

have the revenue stream?
MR. BEITLER:

Well, annual fees are a

11

market component of this type of transaction, so

12

in negotiation we would expect that an annual

13

fee would be -- a fee of some sort would be

14

negotiated.

15

There are different bases in

16

different subway systems for how that fee is

17

negotiated, but there is precedence that the fee

18

exists so we would expect that --

19
20
21

MS. FERGUSON:

I think capital

avoidance by the CTA is a good thing.
CHAIRMAN BELL:

Will they be happy if

22

we were able to structure a deal that they just

23

got the infrastructure installed and they didn't

24

have to pay for it?

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 57
1
2

MR. BEITLER:

Yes, I believe they would

MR. HOFFMAN:

Now, on the fees you're

be.

3
4

talking -- I looked at the New York and D.C.

5

options you have listed here, your point is that

6

both contain fees that the transient agency gets

7

paid by the carriers, in addition to the

8

carriers building out the capital?

9

MR. BEITLER:

That's correct.

For the

10

2G system that exists right now, the CTA does

11

receive a fee from the carriers for that system,

12

although the carriers did not pay to install

13

that system.

14
15

MR. HOFFMAN:

So if you cut to the

chase --

16

CHAIRMAN BELL:

17

MR. BEITLER:

Correct.

18

MR. EPSTEIN:

The CTA paid for the full

19
20

They did not pay?

system 2G in 2005.
CHAIRMAN BELL:

In those other models,

21

the City paid or the CTA of those cities paid

22

for the installation?

23

MR. BEITLER:

24

CHAIRMAN BELL:

In the 2G system.
We're asking them to

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 58
1

pay for it and pay a fee.

2

MR. BEITLER:

3

happening in the other cities.

4
5

Right, which is what's

CHAIRMAN BELL:
mind.

I don't mind.

I mean, I like that.

6

ALDERMAN THOMAS:

7

doing it in other cities.

8

New York and D.C.

I don't

I'm just saying --

They are already
They're doing it in

9

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Good.

And they're

10

getting it done in other cities?

11

MR. BEITLER:

Right.

12

MR. EPSTEIN:

Generally there's a

13

licensing fee to use the City's subway

14

architecture to provide the cellular service,

15

and then there's like an operational or

16

maintenance fee that's on a monthly or annual

17

basis.

18
19
20

MR. BEITLER:

I'm sorry, go ahead,

MR. HOFFMAN:

Very quick on the

please.

21

maintenance point.

It was asked earlier.

When

22

I hear that, it sounds like that suggests,

23

although you said it's to be negotiated, it

24

suggests that one outcome is the CTA may be

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 59
1

responsible for maintenance, but they'll be

2

getting a fee that is designed to cover the

3

operations or a maintenance fee, is that the

4

general idea?

5
6
7

MR. EPSTEIN:

That is my understanding

of how it works in other cities.
MR. BEITLER:

There are issues, just to

8

be clear though, in terms of, for example, who's

9

responsible for upgrading the system as new

10
11
12
13
14
15

technology becomes available.
CHAIRMAN BELL:

Maintenance and upgrade

are two different things.
MR. BEITLER:

Yes.

And that is to be

negotiated between the carriers and the CTA.
MR. HOFFMAN:

Although this principals

16

agreement that you gave us says each company

17

will bear the cost of any carrier's specific

18

feature of any system upgrade.

19

specific, and when you get into the details, the

20

CTA may have some costs relating to upgrades.

21

MR. BEITLER:

So it's

They may.

It's not

22

necessarily the case that the carriers will pay

23

for everything because there may be some things

24

that are specific only to the CTA, and really

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 60
1

have nothing to do with the carriers such as

2

related to the private radio network that the

3

CTA uses for its even communications.

4

MR. HOFFMAN:

So just having read this

5

agreement in principal, can you describe what --

6

so, first of all, it sounds like, although you

7

may be reluctant to pat yourselves on the back,

8

it sounds like you have moved the ball a

9

tremendous amount down the field in a way that's

10

beneficial to the City and to moving this

11

forward?

12

In and of itself that seems very good.
What is the -- this had some vague

13

language in here about what the Trust's role

14

would be going forward in this.

15

about that a little bit?

16
17

MR. BEITLER:

CHAIRMAN BELL:

MR. BEITLER:

24

That's exactly what I'm

We presented two options

to the carrier.

22
23

So we

saying.

20
21

We don't know yet.

presented two options.

18
19

Could you talk

CHAIRMAN BELL:

The devil is in the

details.
MR. BEITLER:

We took the approach

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 61
1

during this process that the Trust would be

2

Switzerland sort of, and so we presented two

3

options to the carriers.

4

continue to utilize the Trust for the purpose of

5

bringing this project to conclusion, and the

6

second option was to not utilize the Trust and

7

to deal directly with the CTA, and that's

8

because there is one option where there is no

9

intermediary that is working on doing these

10

types of projects.

11

to the carriers.

12

One option was to

So we offered both options

The carriers just completed the

13

agreement in principal this past week, and now

14

we will be going -- after this meeting, should

15

the Board approve this as an official project,

16

we would go back to the carriers to make a

17

determination as to whether or not the Trust

18

will continue in this role or whether they would

19

prefer to go their own way.

20

But we didn't want to get into that

21

particular discussion until we had presented it

22

to the Board.

23
24

MR. HOFFMAN:
with that.

I think I'm satisfied

I think it sounds good.

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 62
1

Let me just make one -- I don't want

2

to get off the nuts and bolts of this, but let

3

me take the opportunity to make one broader

4

point for anyone who's listening behind these

5

tables.

6

As I understand this, you're saying

7

that the staff of the Trust through it's

8

research was able to determine that there were

9

other alternatives that were not at the time

10

being considered, suggest those alternatives,

11

come to an agreement with the carriers and the

12

CTA and then moved this to where we are on.

13

it was because of the staff's research and work

14

that that occurred.

15

it.

16

But

I don't want to overstate

MR. BEITLER:

In conjunction with the

17

office of the CTO of the CTA who originally

18

approached us because he was aware that there

19

were other things going -- other alternatives

20

out there but didn't have the ability to

21

research those on let's say a financial,

22

transactional perspective.

23
24

MR. HOFFMAN:
absolutely.

Sure.

So shared credit,

This is a point about our budget

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 63
1

and about City funding.

2

long-term vision is that we would be self

3

sustaining and that's a great vision.

4

I understand that the

But it seems to me that this is a

5

great example if you have truly funded full-time

6

people like Claire and Nick who are there and

7

you have double or triple the number of Claires

8

and Nicks, and we don't have many of them, that

9

the benefit to the City is going to be quite

10
11

great.
This is a tremendous benefit it

12

seems to me that was moved because the CTO of

13

the CTA reached out to you and said I don't have

14

the bandwidth to do some research here, can you

15

help with this, and look what happened.

16

So for those who are listening about

17

funding from the City in the short-term, it

18

seems to me that there's a clear return on

19

investment that as a startup here, adding some

20

money to provide some additional research would

21

be very useful.

22

MR. BEITLER:

So directly to your

23

point, if you look at this chart which we showed

24

earlier, you can see that the CTA 4G project has

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 64
1

very low fee potential.

2

CHAIRMAN BELL:

3

MR. BEITLER:

For the Trust.

For the Trust, but is not

4

particularly complex either to accomplish, so

5

it's definitely what I would call a public good

6

project which I think is what you're alluding to

7

or not alluding to, being very specific about.

8

MR. HOFFMAN:

Sure.

9

MR. BEITLER:

And the CTA has agreed to

10
11
12

Yes.

reimburse us for our expenses so we're -CHAIRMAN BELL:

Definitely the right

thing to do.

13

MR. BEITLER:

Right.

14

CHAIRMAN BELL:

In either model,

15

whether they want us involved and we can niche

16

out a role we think we can do and get a revenue

17

stream or if they don't want us involved, it's

18

clearly the right thing for us to help them.

19

ALDERMAN THOMAS:

20

CHAIRMAN BELL:

21

ALDERMAN THOMAS:

Mr. Chairman.

Yes.
With the CTA

22

reimbursing for costs, that is exactly what the

23

City Council was looking for when we see self

24

sufficiency, not for more City dollars, but

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 65
1

having whatever you do be paid for and the CTA

2

is -- gets tax dollars and so that's their

3

budget.

4

have tax dollars.

5

sufficient, this Trust self sufficient.

6

City has tax dollars.

Public schools

But it makes this fund self

MR. EPSTEIN:

I think one point that we

7

should make, I think an unanticipated outcome of

8

this project is with the carriers involved with

9

the design of the system, we think we will end

10

up with a far superior system in terms of

11

quality, something that will provide better

12

service in the out years compared to what the

13

CTA would have been able to design on their own.

14

MR. BEITLER:

The carriers are very

15

motivated because if you can't make a phone call

16

in the subway, you don't call the CTA, you call

17

the carrier.

18
19

MR. HOFFMAN:

That would drive the

maintenance you would think.

20

CHAIRMAN BELL:

21

MR. EPSTEIN:

Okay.

So the carriers expressed

22

an interest in the consortium approach, and

23

we're currently working on -- they have in place

24

what's called a national teaming agreement which

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 66
1

has been in place for more than ten years which

2

allows them to collectively fund and work on

3

projects without arising of any antitrust

4

issues.

5

So they are currently working on

6

internally how they want to structure this

7

particular project and who will be the lead

8

carrier.

9

carriers that's designated to kind of spearhead

10

There's usually one of the four

the carriers' efforts.

11

MR. RAMIREZ:

I was giggling because I

12

think it's great that they now see the wisdom of

13

collective action.

14

CHAIRMAN BELL:

15

MR. BEITLER:

Okay.

Now we'll go back to

16

Claire to discuss property assessed clean

17

energy, and there will be a conclusion to the

18

CTA 4G project in the executive session.

19

CHAIRMAN BELL:

20

for the vote on that?

21

MR. BEITLER:

When are going to ask

We could ask for it now.

22

We were going to ask for it in the executive

23

session.

24

CHAIRMAN BELL:

I'm asking you that

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 67
1
2
3
4

because David has to leave at 11:30.
MR. BEITLER:

There's no reason not to

do it now.
CHAIRMAN BELL:

Is there anything in

5

the -- Let me ask you this:

Is there anything

6

in the executive session, Steve, that would be

7

information that would affect the vote on that?

8

MR. BEITLER:

9

contract related information.

10
11
12
13
14

No, it's strictly

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Just more detail

that's -MR. BEITLER:

Not publicly disclosable

because it's proprietary or contracting related.
MR. BEITLER:

As you can see in your

15

dec that the slides related to it are at Page 62

16

which goes into costs and 63 and then Page 64 is

17

the resolution.

18

MS. TRAMM:

We won't show the other

19

two, but the resolution is here.

20

CHAIRMAN BELL:

I would like to do it

21

while the full Board is here, unless anyone else

22

has an objection to it, but looking at the

23

charts --

24

MR. BEITLER:

The two other charts are

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 68
1
2

not material.

They are just more detail.

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Just more detail.

I

3

think you've talked through pretty much the

4

benefit of both of these projects and what --

5

you know, what we know about our role now and

6

obviously you have an opportunity to come back

7

and weigh in as negotiations proceed, whether

8

we're going to continue or not, but I think

9

right now with what we see, I think that's where

10

you'd like us to have a vote.

11

MR. RAMIREZ:

12

MS. FERGUSON:

13

CHAIRMAN BELL:

14

Motion.
Seconded.
All in favor?

(A chorus of ayes.)

15

Great.

16

MR. BEITLER:

Thank you.

17

Now, we will ask Claire to take us

18

through the PACE presentation, and then should

19

you care to, we can also -- again there's a

20

couple of slides in executive session for PACE,

21

but they are also similarly detailed slides, and

22

we could, depending upon your desires, flip to

23

that resolution and then go back.

24

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Okay.

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 69
1

MS. TRAMM:

Okay.

So I think we've

2

covered the basics of what a PACE program looks

3

like so I'll try and be brief, but overall, to

4

summarize, the idea is to leverage the City's

5

property tax collection mechanism in service of

6

private sector individual opt in choices by

7

building owners to do energy efficiency and

8

renewable energy types of upgrades to their

9

buildings.

10

And so we just enable our mechanisms

11

to be a collections mechanism which are senior

12

to the mortgage and thus highly secure and

13

getting the financing rates down and of longer

14

term than they could otherwise access.

15

that's the basic approach.

16

So

It increases the nonoperating

17

income, lowers operating expenses, if you're a

18

renter, et cetera.

19

economically.

20

So this is a win/win

It lowers the cost of doing business

21

in the City.

It certainly advances the Mayor's

22

2015 sustainability plans in reducing --

23

improving citywide energy efficiency, and I

24

think it's something that is a great usage of

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 70
1

the City's operational transactions to enable a

2

private sector program like this in the

3

infrastructure space.

4

So Page 46 just shows the

5

development timeline of this program.

6

been in R and D since mid last year.

7

received an unsolicited proposal in January and

8

then proceeded, after you reviewed this in

9

February, we proceeded to an open bidding

We have
We

10

process that was spurred by that unsolicited

11

proposal in May.

12

We received a number of responses

13

back by June 26th and are now evaluating those

14

to create the program.

15

Also I should mention on here the

16

city energy benchmarking ordinance was

17

implemented on June 1st which means that all of

18

these big commercial property owners are having

19

to disclose how much energy they're using and

20

are essentially now in competition or being

21

rated and there's more consciousness of this.

22

So I think this follows in an

23

extremely timely manner to offer people a tool

24

financially to actually do something about that

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 71
1

energy usage in their building if they're

2

finding it's much higher than they expected.

3

So our hope is that today we can get

4

your blessing to move ahead with the selection

5

of these program administrators and financiers

6

and other partners because it's quite an

7

interesting group that you pull together to do a

8

project like this and then begin with program

9

set up and again bring us to the City Council in

10

roughly November -- October, November time

11

frame.

12

So just to -MR. HOFFMAN:

What are the logistics of

13

that, Claire?

14

them or what is the mechanism that you issue or

15

do to choose them?

16

Do you issue an RFP to choose

MS. TRAMM:

So that was the open

17

bidding process that commenced in May and

18

wrapped up on June 26th.

19

the question and answer period on the proposals

20

we received.

21

20 and 150 pages so they are traditional sort of

22

RFP responses, and we posted to our website what

23

looks an awful lot like a traditional RFP, so I

24

believe it's still up there so you can review it

Now we're sort of in

I mean, these vary between about

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 72
1
2

at any time.
MR. HOFFMAN:

The open bidding process

3

the people sent in responses for their bids was

4

in response to what?

5

MR. BEITLER:

6

that we received.

7

proposal.

8
9
10

What did we issue?
An unsolicited proposal

We received an unsolicited

MR. HOFFMAN:

We issued something to

let the world know you should bid.
MR. BEITLER:

We do the open bidding

11

process which says to the world we received an

12

unsolicited proposal, anybody who would like to

13

submit their own proposal may do so.

14
15

MR. HOFFMAN:

Right, that's the thing.

What do you call that?

16

MR. BEITLER:

Open bidding process.

17

MR. HOFFMAN:

So on the timeline it

18

says OBP begins, that's when we issued the open

19

bidding process?

20

MS. TRAMM:

Exactly.

And that was

21

posted in mid May on the website, and then also

22

I accompanied that with an email to everyone who

23

expressed interest in this program, along with

24

the national association of folks that are

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 73
1

involved with PACE programs across the country.

2

So Page 47 just shows the proposed

3

transaction structure diagram, although this may

4

change in response to the actual program design

5

help that we're bringing on board when we select

6

them in the future.

7

MS. FERGUSON:

What's the difference,

8

Claire, does the building owner see in their tax

9

break?

10
11

Is there a line item?
MS. TRAMM:

It's a line item.

It's an

additional line item.

12

MS. FERGUSON:

So there is a new line

13

item that appears that is incremental or

14

replaces something else?

15

MS. TRAMM:

It is incremental.

It is

16

not a substitute for anything on the tax bill.

17

Again it's opt in so only with your full consent

18

and lots of project development to get to this

19

point do you see that item on your tax bill.

20

It's not, you know, a TIF or by

21

majority vote in your district.

None of that

22

stuff.

23

then your commensurate bill that goes down is

24

your energy bill.

This is particular to your building, and

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 74
1

ALDERMAN POPE:

Claire, I just had a

2

question.

3

of the property have, if any, to tenants?

4

there some formal notification that we're

5

planning to participate in this program, you'll

6

see an incremental increase in your real estate

7

tax bill?

8
9

What kind of disclosure do the owners

MS. TRAMM:

Is

Yeah, it's a great

question, disclosure to tenants.

What we do

10

show in one of the later slides is sort of which

11

markets this would effect so I'll show on 52.

12

CHAIRMAN BELL:

It would be in your

13

lease fees, I mean, if they're going to put it

14

in there.

15

MS. TRAMM:

What's happening is

16

basically your property tax is a pass through to

17

your lessees already, and so, you know, they'll

18

be notified basically that one is going to go up

19

and the other is going to go down and that they

20

will be commensurate.

21

MR. RAMIREZ:

Claire, it's important

22

that we remember as well that the City

23

benchmarking ordinance, I see it in every

24

building I get into practically, they pop it on

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 75
1

the screen if it's got one of those screens

2

inside the elevator, talk about how much energy

3

they saved this year and how many trees they

4

saved and blah, blah, blah.

5

MS. TRAMM:

6

MR. RAMIREZ:

Yes.
So it's there.

I mean,

7

they're bragging about it and reporting it and

8

trying to use it as a tool for telling tenants

9

that we're a very efficient building.

10

MR. BEITLER:

I don't think there's a

11

notification issue because in every lease there

12

would be a requirement for notification.

13

would basically follow the requirements that

14

exist in the lease.

15

MS. TRAMM:

You

We believe that even if the

16

building owner makes these decisions it's going

17

to net net benefit the lessee.

18

So that's the transaction structure.

19

It's a little complicated, but on the left side,

20

you know, we're showing basically the

21

relationship between the building owner, the

22

contractor that they select to actually do the

23

work and then their mortgage lender whose

24

approval they need to be able to put a first

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 76
1

lien above the mortgage, and I believe it's now

2

two banks and counting that have approved first

3

liens.

4

CHAIRMAN BELL:

5

approve that?

6

great.

I saw that data.

7

MR. BEITLER:

8

MS. TRAMM:

9

CHAIRMAN BELL:

10

Why on earth would they

MS. TRAMM:

I said that's

They're in the business.

There's two reasons.
Lending, okay.

It actually improves the

11

net operating income of the building because

12

you're lowering the overall expenses, so you're

13

actually improving your mortgage lendee's

14

ability to pay when you do this.

15

And, number two, it's starting to

16

become a competitive market, so if you don't do

17

it, they might take their whole mortgage

18

somewhere else.

19

MR. HOFFMAN:

I want to ask about the

20

risk, if any, to the City.

21

some bullets.

22

slightly.

23

Claire?

24

On 51 you've got

The first one gets to this point

Can you address that question,

MS. TRAMM:

Which one?

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 77
1

MR. HOFFMAN:

The overall question as

2

to whether there's any risk to the City from our

3

approving this, and, if so, how would you define

4

that.

5

says to City and County, does not impact credit

6

or balance sheet.

7

that out a little bit.

On 51 you've got it cash flow neutral

I just wanted you to flush

8

MS. TRAMM:

9

go down to Page 51.

10
11

Absolutely.

MR. HOFFMAN:

I guess I'll

Sorry to take you off

topic.

12

MS. TRAMM:

13

to the City and the County.

14

just a pass through.

15

operational pass through.

16

no responsibility to pay these before the PACE

17

liens on any individual property owner's tax

18

bills if those property owners don't pay them.

19

So it is cash flow neutral
It's essentially

They are acting as an
They have absolutely

You're simply assigning the

20

collected amount that's, you know, coming from a

21

specific property owner on a specific building

22

and passing that through to the financier with

23

whom, you know, we are negotiating the program

24

finances to come from.

So they are just acting

as a conduit.

2

no overhead costs.

issued.

4
5

It does not affect them.

There's

There's no bonds being

MR. HOFFMAN:

No ultimate liability for

anything.

6

MS. TRAMM:

No.

7

MR. HOFFMAN:

I mean, when I'm

8

listening to this, right, my understanding of

9

PACE programs is that the answer to the question

10

is there isn't any.

11

MS. TRAMM:

12

MR. HOFFMAN:

Yes.
There's isn't a material

13

risk to the City.

I wanted to ask that to

14

confirm that.

15

similar fashion, is really as it seems like

16

facilitator.

And our role here, in a somewhat

17

MR. BEITLER:

Program administrator.

18

MR. HOFFMAN:

Another way of saying it.

19

MR. BEITLER:

Yes.

20

MR. HOFFMAN:

To both bring the City --

21

you know, take advantage of the City's ordinance

22

and bring the idea forward into something that's

23

concrete and then act as an administrator with

24

the selected administrators to move forward.

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 79
1

MS. TRAMM:

2

MR. HOFFMAN:

3

Exactly.
With that understanding,

it seems like a really good thing.

4

CHAIRMAN BELL:

I think the only risk

5

would make the property tax billing system more

6

complex which is nothing I would think.

7
8

MR. HOFFMAN:

For the property owners

who opt in.

9

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Well, for the City,

10

County administrator that has to process the tax

11

papers.

12

MR. BEITLER:

One of the things as part

13

of the program though is processing is actually

14

incorporated in the program so we absorb that

15

processing requirement.

16

MS. TRAMM:

Again, I mean, it's

17

completely opt in, so if no one wants to use

18

this program for whatever reason, it just sits

19

there.

20

behalf.

21

believe will help the private sector.

22

we've brought on a different group of

23

stakeholders to advise us as we shape this

24

program so that, you know, is most useable to

It's not accruing any costs on our
We're enabling a capability that we

them.

2

MR. BEITLER:

3

back to 49.

4

just 49.

5

I think you should go

We have covered everything else but

MS. TRAMM:

So 49 just shows that this

6

is actually a huge trend in the last two to

7

three years now nationwide, that commercial PACE

8

programs have really taken off and in particular

9

I think Connecticut has done a great job of

10

issuing about $20 million last year in new PACE

11

projects, and the LA County PACE program also

12

did I think one of the largest projects,

13

$7 million on a Hilton Hotel there, so this is

14

picking up steam.

15

$72 million of deals that have been closed and

16

several hundred more million dollars in

17

pipeline.

18

There's over 7200 --

It has been used -- on Page 50, it

19

has been used across a number of different types

20

of buildings and for mostly energy efficiency

21

upgrades, although also renewable energy, so

22

things like solar or geothermal can be funded

23

with this.

24

So back to 51, I think we sort of

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 81
1

talked about bullet one here, but the second two

2

are -- you know, what's cool about this is that

3

normally the property owners don't necessarily

4

want to spend additional money to upgrade a

5

building when their tenants see the energy

6

savings, and so this sort of resolves that lack

7

of incentive alignment by putting it in a part

8

of the capital structure for the building owner

9

that gets passed through back to the tenants, so

10
11

that's great.
And then, as I mentioned, the PACE

12

lien takes a senior position to the mortgage,

13

but we've -- we believe that this is not proven

14

now to be a huge barrier to the markets opening.

15

MR. HOFFMAN:

I'm curious in these

16

other places around the country where there's a

17

PACE program, is there a Chicago Infrastructure

18

Trust equivalent or any other kind of

19

governmental or independent facilitator?

20

MS. TRAMM:

Interestingly there is.

It

21

comes in a variety of formats, but for

22

Connecticut it's the Connecticut Green Bank and

23

what's known as CEFIA, I forget what the exact

24

acronym stands for, but they have a bank that is

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 82
1

essentially offering the revolving loans and

2

providing a line of working capital to finance

3

construction, and then they go take it and

4

finance it and securitize it in a big portfolio

5

of PACE loans.

6

We won't provide that as far as our

7

program.

8

and someone else will warehouse it.

9

created the structure and they did the program

10

administration and hired on all of the various

11

players that would need to happen and sort of

12

manage the political process, they were

13

instrumental to that.

14

the board.

15

forward.

16

We're doing things on a one off basis
They

So you see that across

There has to be somebody moving it

So, Page 52, just a quick overview

17

of the segmentation about who we think it's

18

going to apply to.

19

leased on the left-hand side buildings we

20

believe this will benefit with the one caveat

21

that in leased buildings where it's basically

22

modified gross leases, where it's a specific

23

type of lease where there isn't that clear

24

energy savings alignment and the building owners

Both owner occupied and

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 83
1

might not have an incentive right now to do

2

this, those are the ones where you need some

3

sort of energy aligned lease provision tacked on

4

to make this make sense, but most leases, triple

5

net or full service gross leases would already

6

be aligned incentive wise with this kind of a

7

program.

8

We also believe that it will apply

9

across the scale of Class A through Class D real

10

estate, and as we go down to some of the smaller

11

projects, the key things that we're going to

12

make sure we make -- we are thinking about as we

13

do program design are, number one, if you're

14

only doing a 5 or $10,000 project that we make

15

sure that our chosen financiers can actually do

16

projects of that small size and that they are on

17

the hook not just for the big guys but also to

18

serve our small guys.

19

And then, secondly, with the smaller

20

folks that they understand, you know, totally

21

what they're getting into.

22

lot of marketing material that will apply, you

23

know, for decision makers of all these various

24

size entity.

So we're creating a

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 84
1

The other thing that's interesting

2

is in the second couple columns, not for profit

3

and government, we found that the Port Authority

4

of Toledo, Ohio as well as some -- a few other

5

areas that have PACE programs have figured out a

6

way to essentially have an opt in property tax

7

that enables PACE to apply for not for profits

8

and government entities that aren't normally

9

property taxed, so we are trying to figure out

10

how we might copy what they did to enable a

11

broader array of entities to opt in to these

12

kind of assessments.

13

Then obviously we're avoiding right

14

now residential and that's due to the FHFA's

15

essentially rejection of the idea of having this

16

kind of lien trump residential mortgages which

17

have a different back end on the securitization

18

market.

19

CHAIRMAN BELL:

20

MS. TRAMM:

Okay.

Page 53 just shows people

21

are excited about this.

22

being done elsewhere, 7 million at the Hilton in

23

LA.

24

There's huge projects

I believe that's it for our main session.
CHAIRMAN BELL:

You need a motion?

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 85

MR. BEITLER:

So if you maybe, Claire,

2

if you would take this to the page that's

page --

4

MS. TRAMM:
the resolution?

6
7

MR. BEITLER:

No.

No.

No.

Page 65,

thank you.

8
9

A motion to end or go to

MS. TRAMM:

So this is the PACE

resolution which would authorize us to negotiate

10

and enter into contracts with a combination of

11

the respondents we have for different pieces of

12

the program.

13

MR. BEITLER:

And to be clear here for

14

this particular procurement, most likely this

15

never ends, all right, so that as we go forward

16

with this program, we will constantly be

17

selecting contractors to enter into the program,

18

and we may ask some contractors to leave

19

depending upon performance.

20

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Got it.

Okay.

Any

21

questions, comments for the group or can I get a

22

motion?

23

ALDERMAN POPE:

24

MS. FERGUSON:

Move do pass.
Second.

CHAIRMAN BELL:

2

(A chorus of ayes.)

3

Okay.

4

MR. HOFFMAN:

5

I'm sorry to the Board

CHAIRMAN BELL:
see Scott.

8

Great.

Members, I have to leave.

6
7

All in favor.

All right.

I didn't

Is he here?

MR. BEITLER:

No, he's at a partner

meeting so Steve Butler is here as his stand in.

10

CHAIRMAN BELL:

All right.

So we need

11

to have public comment, is that the next thing?

12

So are there any public comments before we go

13

into our executive session?

14
15
16

MR. ARCHIE:

Me again.

I'm a bed

penny.
CHAIRMAN BELL:

Okay.

Could you

17

introduce yourself so that the stenographer can

18

get your name?

19

Go up here.

MR. ARCHIE:

I'm Mike Archie.

I'm with

20

GTM Strategies is my own development company.

21

Two points.

22

I didn't want to interrupt, but with CNG risk

23

profile, a couple things, comments that I have

24

from being in the market.

One that came up from earlier that

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 87
1

One, at a $2 per GG fuel cost

2

productivity, are you ever considering the risk

3

that you're not moving fast enough?

4

lot of fuel products going to be there.

5

There's a

As far at the commodity risk, LNG

6

Export, yeah, that's a long way away.

7

going to be opening up the global markets for

8

the pricing, but there are billion investments

9

and takes years to come online.

10

Yes, it's

When you're talking about vehicles,

11

that comes right back to asset risk.

12

are six to ten year replacement cycles.

13

a manageable asset risk.

14

The assets
That's

Today's point on electrification and

15

technology, I see it as all of the above.

It's

16

a portfolio and diversification.

17

power plants have their places depending on the

18

duty cycle.

19

but it does fit a certain amount of duty cycles.

Each of the

CNG is not -- if doesn't fit all,

20

And then, lastly, Chairman, you

21

asked about the conversion of fleet and the

22

investment.

23

much cash flow.

24

don't have to do that.

The City wouldn't have to invest
It can get structured so they

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 88
1

Lastly, I guess the most important

2

thing I want to bring up, and it's something

3

that I brought up last time, it's how to work

4

with the CIT, at least the staff.

5

I can see you guys have a role as

6

an overseer.

7

CIT more of as a competitor than a collaborator.

8

Do they have exclusive access to the City and

9

the City's assets and their infrastructure, and

10
11
12
13

Right now I see the staff or the

have they been dubbed having that?
CHAIRMAN BELL:

No.

No.

We don't have

exclusivity with the City.
MR. ARCHIE:

Okay.

Obviously it's

14

very -- it functions very well because now you

15

do have access to all of the different things.

16

It's more efficient that way.

17

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Yeah, we have access to

18

more than we'd like.

We really would like it to

19

be a little more streamlined.

20

MR. ARCHIE:

My challenge and/or what

21

I'm trying to bring paradigm here is that there

22

are plenty of ideas.

23

carrier, right?

24

this room and they were able to take an idea and

They nailed it with the

You got some good thinkers in

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 89
1

make it better.

2

Will they be able to do that for

3

every situation?

Are they subject matter

4

experts?

5

outside community, entrepreneurs come in and

6

bring creative ideas that might be creative to

7

the staff, to you, to the City, but also allow

8

the entrepreneur to monetize that value?

Are they creative?

Or how can the

9

Right now there's not a process in

10

place for us to participate and take advantage

11

and get value for our ideas, and that's

12

continuing -- we need to try to fix that.

13

CHAIRMAN BELL:

You do have access to

14

Steve, and I hear what you're saying.

You view

15

the Trust as somewhat of a competitor.

We'll

16

just have to work through that, and I don't know

17

what that means, if we can in all cases, but

18

clearly, I mean, we're open to new ideas.

19

Now, if you want to get paid for

20

your idea, that's a different story, and I don't

21

know that we have that to be able to do that

22

yet.

23
24

And in terms of access to the City,
you know, there are representatives from the

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 90
1

City here that should give you their cards, and

2

I just don't know how that process works.

3

MR. ARCHIE:

Yeah, neither do I.

4

That's why I'm getting clarification.

5

I'm a capitalist.

6

not going to give my ideas away because if I

7

give the ideas on an RFI, I give an idea and

8

then it gets RFP and somehow, some way I get

9

disenfranchised.

10

Chairman,

I'm here to make money.

I'm

I probably should keep the

ideas.

11

CHAIRMAN BELL:

No, I hear you, but we

12

have to have an open process.

13

documented on the website.

Steve or the staff

14

can elaborate more on that.

You just got to

15

decide.

16

MR. ARCHIE:

Okay.

It is what we've

I appreciate it.

I

17

will tell you I have put FOIAs in and I've tried

18

to contact the staff, and I've not gotten

19

response.

20

it's a startup.

21

going to be things.

22

So that part of the process -- I know
There's no problem.

There's

But again the exclusion of the

23

entrepreneurs and innovators that are out there,

24

hey, my ideas might be stupid and you might

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 91
1

never adopt them, I would at least like to get a

2

shot.

3

CHAIRMAN BELL:

For the record, we

4

don't want to exclude entrepreneurs and thought

5

leaders.

6

our goal.

7

We do not want to do that.

That's not

You can limit us because you want to

8

be paid for your thoughts and ideas which we

9

don't have the capability to do, but we sure as

10

heck will listen to them.

11

clear on that for the record.

12

MR. ARCHIE:

13

CHAIRMAN BELL:

14

MR. ARCHIE:

15

CHAIRMAN BELL:

16
17

I just want you to be

Okay.
Thank you for comments.

Thank you.
Any other comments?

(No response.)
All right.

Steve, why don't you

18

walk us through the closure and cite what

19

article that puts us into executive session?

20

MR. BUTLER:

21

Steve Butler.

22

work for the Trust.

23
24

Absolutely.

My name is

I'm from Kirkland & Ellis.

I do

So Section 2(c)(7) of the Illinois
Open Meetings Acts states that a public meeting

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 92
1

or a public body may hold closed meetings to

2

consider items such as the sale or purchase of

3

securities, investments or investment contracts.

4

The remainder of today's meeting

5

involves confidential procurement and investment

6

matters that fall within that exception, so we

7

have the authorization to convene a closed

8

meeting at this point.

9

CHAIRMAN BELL:

10

motion to close the open meeting?

11
12

MR. RAMIREZ:

Okay.

So can I have a

We have to move pursuant

to that specific section that you read out.

13

MR. BUTLER:

Pursuant to

14

Section 2(c)(7) of the Illinois Open Meetings

15

Act.

16

CHAIRMAN BELL:

17

MR. RAMIREZ:

18

Did you remember that?

But it has to be -- we

have to say it specifically so yeah.

19

CHAIRMAN BELL:

20

MS. FERGUSON:

So moved.

21

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Second?

22

ALDERMAN POPE:

Seconded.

23

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Okay.

24

Okay.

Do I have a motion?

The public

version of this meeting is ended, and we will go

about?

Now we are back in open

Any other new business we should talk

Any other comments?

(No response.)

14

Hey, great job, team.

15

really on the briefings and on the data, you

16

guys provided, both of you.

complex projects and I think you really provided

some clarity.

Yes, sir.
You were going to get

something out because you thought you might need

some in the interim.

3

MR. BEITLER:

Well, we're going to send

4

out a request for scheduling for the upcoming

5

year.

6

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Okay.

So you think you

7

have enough scheduled meetings for now?

8

in good shape?

9
10

MR. BEITLER:

You're

We're in good shape.

Okay.

If there is
