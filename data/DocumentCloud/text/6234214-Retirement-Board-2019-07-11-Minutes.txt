2. Review and Consideration of:
a. Bills, Payroll Records
The trustees noted that the submitted request to pay an annual regulatory fee under the
Affordable Care Act (“ACA) totaled nearly $30,000, and has been increasing regularly. The
payment supports the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Initiative to study patients’
evaluations of treatment within the healthcare system. It is commonly referred to as the
“PCORI” fee and is calculated based upon the number of persons covered under the Fund’s
Retiree Health Plan. Fund fiduciary counsel was asked to determine if pending litigation
challenging the constitutionality of the ACA would impact the continued imposition of the
PCORI fee.
It was moved by Trustee McFadden and seconded by Trustee Nevius, that the action taken by
Fund staff in remitting the indicated payments for the presented bills and payroll records in
June, 2019, the Board having received confirmation from Fund staff that the payments were
consistent with the approved 2019 administrative budget, that the payments be ratified.

3. Benefit Matters
a. Calculation Considerations
Regina Tuczak, Executive Director, stated that the recent legislation allowing the purchase of
service and/or earnings credit for employees on furlough from December 1, 2017, through
November 30, 2018, became effective on June 7, 2019 as P.A. 101-0011 (“Furlough
3

 Legislation”). The legislation allows employees who had received salary reductions and/or
furlough periods during the stated time period to purchase additional salary and/or service
credit which may ultimately increase their annuity benefit. Under the Furlough Legislation,
employees are required to purchase the credit while they are still employed. Because several
members with planned retirement dates in June expressed interest in purchasing the credit,
Fund staff developed a calculation method and certification form to be utilized that was
consistent with the Furlough Legislation and which calculated how much the employee
needed to pay the Fund before they withdrew from service. Ms. Tuczak stated that during
the processing of these initial requests, it was noted that the salary reductions reflected in the
Fund’s pension administration system (“PBMS”) were sometimes lower than the salary
reductions certified by the employer, perhaps due to different interpretations of what
constituted a salary reduction. In some instances, the employer’s calculation required the
employee to pay a higher amount to purchase the additional salary under the Furlough
Legislation, and ultimately receive a higher annuity.
The trustees discussed the term ‘salary reduction’ as used in the legislation and whether it
included scheduled raises that were not implemented on December 1, 2017. John McCabe,
the Legislative Representative, stated that there was no discussion of the term ‘salary
reduction’ in the legislative history of the Furlough Legislation. The trustees discussed the
certification needed from the employer to comply with the legislation and the calculation of
the payment due from the employee if there is a discrepancy in the salary reduction as
certified by the employer versus the payroll data received by the Fund. Fund staff was
directed to get confirmation from the County’s Comptroller regarding the employer’s
certified salary reduction amount if a discrepancy exists.
It was moved by Trustee Fitzgerald and seconded by Trustee McFadden that the Fund staff
should continue to utilize the calculation of the ‘salary reduction’ for payment due based
upon the payroll information provided by the employer to the Fund and reflected in PBMS. If
the amount of the ‘salary reduction’ separately certified by the County is different from the
Fund’s calculation resulting in a higher payment due from the employee, then Fund staff
shall rely upon the County’s certification until such time as the differences between the
calculation methods can be resolved.

MOTION ADOPTED

b. Communication Considerations
The Executive Director stated that in some instances, employers sent letters or emails to
employees regarding the Furlough Legislation and she provided a sample of such a
communication to the trustees. She stated that the Fund posted information about the
Furlough Legislation on its website, but that the employer communications were neither
requested nor approved by the Fund staff. The Executive Director stated that a draft letter
4

 had been prepared for the trustees’ consideration which could be mailed to all active
members advising them about the Furlough Legislation.
The trustees discussed the proposed letter, possible revisions and how it might be
disseminated. The trustees directed that the communication be emailed to the County’s
timekeepers and department heads so that it could be posted and made available to active
members.
4. Discussion and Possible Action Regarding Legislative Matters
The Executive Director stated that the Board had requested draft legislation for both the County
Fund and the Forest Fund that would provide for actuarial-based funding and would situate the
Funds in a similar funding position with other public retirement systems in the State of Illinois. She
stated that that Ms. Mary Pat Burns, Fund fiduciary counsel, was asked to draft such proposed
legislation and that the Fund’s actuary, Larry Langer of Cavanaugh MacDonald Consulting, LLC
was to provide the employers’ required annual contributions for the ramp years of 2022, 2023 and
2024. She added that while the actuary provided calculations for the County Fund, the liability for
retiree health care benefits was not included. Calculations for the Forest Fund legislation had not yet
been requested or calculated by Cavanaugh MacDonald, LLC. The actuary also provided a letter for
the Board summarizing his analysis of the proposed legislation. The trustees discussed that the
actuarial calculations for the County Fund needed to be revised to include the healthcare liability and
that the actuary needed to provide similar calculations for the Forest Fund.
Mr. John McCabe, the Fund’s legislative representative, stated that if the employer agreed to the
proposed legislation, that it would be possible to have it passed when the General Assembly was in
session next November. He noted that without the employer’s consent, the legislation was not likely
to move through the General Assembly.
The Executive Director stated that the actuary was requesting fees between $7,000 and $9,000 for
the work already performed. The trustees discussed whether there should be separate billing from
the actuary for the work requested and asked the Fund’s fiduciary counsel to review the actuary’s
agreement and to prepare a follow up letter for the actuary.
It was moved by Trustee McFadden and seconded by Trustee Kouruklis that the Executive Director
be authorized to engage the actuary to revise the County’s required annual contributions for the
ramp years of 2022, 2023 and 2024 to include the healthcare liability for the proposed legislation for
the County Fund and to engage the actuary to provide the Forest Preserve District’s required annual
contributions, including healthcare liability, for the ramp years of 2022, 2023 and 2024 for the
proposed legislation for the Forest Fund.

Illinois Supreme Court and it was further moved that the firm of Burke, Burns & Pinelli, Ltd. be

It was moved by Trustee Goode and seconded by Trustee DeGraff that the effective date of the
policy change adopted by the Board at their meeting on June 6, 2019, prohibiting members who drop
coverage under the Retiree Health Plan from re-enrolling at a later date, be amended from January 1,
2020 to some later date as the Board might determine.

6. Election Matters

Independent Election Administrator (“IEA”) for the elections to be held in 2019 and 2020
had been executed on behalf of the vendor and had been approved as to form by the Fund’s
fiduciary counsel. The Board asked that the IEA confirm its approval of the services to be
provided by Timothy Walsh and Associates as an election consultant, particularly the
requirement that mail-in ballots will be picked up from the Post Office each day 11:00 AM
CST, including the Election Day. The trustees asked that any communications to members
about mail-in voting provide that ballots must be received by 11:00 AM CST on the Election
Day in order to be counted.
It was moved by Trustee Fitzgerald and seconded by Trustee Goode that the Board authorize
the Fund to execute the agreement with Simon & Griseta through December 31, 2020, to
6

 provide services at an hourly rate of $205, but not to exceed a cumulative amount of
$200,000 without a written agreement and to acknowledge that mail-in ballots will be picked

the Fund to execute the agreement with Timothy Walsh and Associates to provide services as

 7. Administrative Matters
a. Approval of Referral of Matter Pursuant to 40 ILCS §5/1-135
The Executive Director reported that there were four falsified checks that had been presented
to the Custodian for payment in June, 2019. The checks bear the correct name of the account
holder (the Fund) and a correct account number, but none of the intended payees were
members of the Fund. She added that while none of the checks were honored because of
security controls that are in place, the trustees should consider whether the incident should be
referred to the Cook County State’s Attorney pursuant to Section1-135 of the Illinois Pension
Code.
It was moved by Trustee Fitzgerald and seconded by Trustee McFadden that the Board find
that there is a reasonable suspicion that the four identified checks presented for payment to
BNY/Mellon between June 5, 2019 and June 7, 2019, constitute falsified records within the
meaning of Section 1-135 of the Illinois Pension Code and in accordance with 40 ILCS 5/9135, that the incidents be reported to the Cook County State’s Attorney.

MOTION ADOPTED BY VOICE VOTE

It was moved by Trustee McFadden and seconded by Trustee Kouruklis, as is
consistent with the authority previously given to the Executive Director, that the
presented amendment to the subscription agreement with BoardEffect reducing the
number of users and thereby decreasing the annual subscription fee from $4,961 to

agreement be approved and that the Executive Director be authorized to execute and

The Executive Director reported that Commissioner Gainer requested that the Fund make a
presentation before the Pension Committee on July 18, 2019, to address 2018 investment

Tuczak noted some disclosures that were not complete when the financials were presented at

Fund’s website. Hardcopies or PDF versions of these reports will be provided to any trustee
who might so request.

 The Executive Director had been recently made aware of an invoice due to the Fund’s former
actuary related to services rendered during the transition to the new actuary. The invoice
requested additional fees of $8,900 and was believed to have been sent as an attachment to an
email to the Fund’s former executive director. The trustees discussed the nature of the
services provided by the former actuary in the transition. The Executive Director was
directed to contact the former actuary and obtain more detail about the services rendered to
support the requested fees.
The trustees also inquired about the procedures for reviewing emails sent to the former
executive director after she had separated from service. In a response to a question, the
Director of Administrative Services stated that she had not received emails sent to the former
executive director. The trustees directed the Executive Director to determine how the emails
to the former executive director were managed after her employment with the Fund ended.
The Executive Director reported that Commissioner Gainer had requested a meeting with her
prior to the presentation before the Pension Committee. She would advise the trustees at
their next meeting of any significant topics that might be discussed.
The trustees were reminded that the Investment Committee would meet on July 25, 2019.
She also stated that the Legislative Committee meeting scheduled for July 25, 2019, had been
cancelled at the direction of the Committee’s Chairperson.
