RE: CHWMAAH

As per Sharon Rose?s response memo dtd. 14 Mar 2018, please identify and allocate $3.5 million in the FY
2019-20 budget to fund the Charles H. Wright Museum ofAfrican American History. This is a $l.6
million increase over the FY 2018-19 budget. The increase should be used in the following manner: $1.1
million should be classi?ed as a capital improvement for the repair of the museum?s roof and the additional
$500k should be used for operations. My of?ce will work with the OCFO to identify $1.6 million to fund
this new expenditure.

As we look to care for our cultural gems it becomes ever more critical that we provide the proper ?nancial
support for our institutions and ensure these organizations are able to provide programing to the Metro-
Detroit region?s residents without fear of the roof falling in, or the inability to provide a safe and
comfortable environment. I believe it is a regional shortcoming that this cultural gem, designed to tell the
story of America?s African descendants, does not have a dedicated revenue stream, i.e. millage, like its
neighbor the Detroit Institute of Arts. Ms. Rose?s memo response to the museum?s capital improvement
need is inserted below.

1) Please briefly explain the new capital funding requests MAAH is planning to
implement in FY 2019. Please provide which Appropriation/Cost Center the new
initiatives will affect in FY 2019.

The museum desires to replace the 21-year old roof system that is original to the
building. The roof has exceeded it life expectancy and is exhibiting signs of
shrinkage and deterioration. Once the membrane begins to degrade to this point, the
seams beneath the ballast stone become more stressed, creating the potential for large
seam failures. Unfortunately with a single ballasted EPDM roof system, there are
no options for restoring the roof and repairs/maintenance costs are typically expensive
due to the amount of labor required to find the leak area, remove the ballast stone,
properly clean the membrane, and finally make the repair. Once the roof system reaches
the end of its life, there are no other options other than replacement. There would be
considerable cost, structural and potential health issues if the roof leaks are not
addressed. Although some roof repairs have just been made, it was only designed to get
the museum by until the necessary roof replacement is started. The total roof
replacement cost is estimated at between $900,000 and $1.2 million
