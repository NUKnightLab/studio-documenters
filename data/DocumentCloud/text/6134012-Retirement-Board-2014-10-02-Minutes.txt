c. Annuities, Spouse and Child Annuities and Refunds
The Fund’s staff presented their recommendations to the Board regarding the applications for
annuities, spouse and child annuities and refunds and confirmed that they followed the
Fund’s procedures in reviewing and processing the applications in making their
recommendations. The Fund staff noted for the Board that the application submitted for a
spouse annuity under Office Number 176357, a former Cook County employee who had
been convicted of a felony related to her own County employment. The member forfeited her
right to annuity benefits under Section 9-235 of the Illinois Pension Code in 2010. She was
now requesting a spouse annuity based upon the service of her recently deceased husband.
[Trustee Herrera stated that she would recuse herself from any discussion or consideration of
the application for a spouse annuity submitted under Office Number 176357.]
The Fund staff noted for the Board a decision made by the Illinois Appellate Court, First
District, under Article 8 of the Pension Code, [Cirignani v. Municipal Employees’, Officers’
and Officials’ Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago, 317 Ill. App.3d 732 (1st Dist. 2000] in
which the court held that a surviving spouse was entitled to a spouse annuity benefit,
notwithstanding the forfeiture of the surviving spouse’s own annuity benefits because of a
felony conviction. The trustees discussed the impact of the Cirignani decision and it was
suggested that the Board defer action on the application for a spouse annuity submitted under
Office Number 176357 for further review.
It was then moved by Trustee McFadden and seconded by Trustee Goode, after due
consideration of the applications presented to the Board, with the exception of the application
for a spouse annuity submitted under Office Number 176357, and having received
confirmation from the staff that they followed the Fund’s procedures in reviewing and
processing the applications, that the recommendations for the presented annuities and refunds
be approved.

the 2014 Annual Conference for Asian American Investment Professionals in San Francisco,
California on October 7-8, 2014, in San Francisco, California.

 b. Status report from Independent Election Administrator
The Executive Director summarized the report from the Independent Election Administrator
regarding the status of the election of the County Employee Member position. Two
candidates had filed nominating petitions for the office and no challenges had been made.
The IEA had sent notices of the process for voting by mail and for voting in person. The
election will proceed on October 29, 2014.
c. Fund Office Space Upgrades
The Executive Director reported the need for the Fund to address the long-term space
requirements for Document Management, IT, Investments and Member Privacy. Because the
scanning of the documents retained in the 10th Floor file room was nearly completed, the
space could be reconfigured to centralize IT and Document Management work areas. Other
space would then be available to provide added privacy for members when in conference
with counselors and to obtain other efficiencies in the use of the Fund’s available work space
for Investments. The Fund’s lease requires that any construction work would need to be
performed by a vendor approved by the landlord.
It was moved by Trustee McFadden and seconded by Trustee Nester that the Board retain
Bear Construction, to provide construction services at an estimated cost of $41,000, and
Hendrickson Furniture, to provide design services and furniture at an estimated cost of
$33,500, to implement the proposed reconfiguration of the Fund’s office space. It is further
moved that Fund staff be authorized to take all steps reasonably necessary to effectuate the
foregoing including the execution and delivery of related written agreements on behalf of the
Fund by the Executive Director.

d. IT Infrastructure Upgrade
Michael Maratea, Director of Finance, described the Fund’s IT infrastructure needs. Mr.
Maratea reported that the while the Fund has implemented upgrades to both hardware and
software as needed, the focus has frequently addressed only short-term issues. As a result,
the present infrastructure configuration is at maximum capacity and has no room for growth.
Mr. Maratea stated that a more unified infrastructure will allow the Fund to reduce the
number of servers, to improve onsite and disaster recovery storage and will allow other
efficiencies in testing and deployment.
It was moved by Trustee Lewandowski and seconded by Trustee McFadden that the Board
approve the implementation of upgrades and enhancements to the Fund’s IT infrastructure as

 presented, at a total estimated cost of $75,500.00 for hardware, software and external IT
support from the identified vendors. It is further moved that the Fund staff be authorized to
take all steps reasonably necessary to effectuate the foregoing including the execution and
delivery of related written agreements on behalf of the Fund by the Executive Director.

3. Duty Disability Consideration
Gary LeDonne, Senior Benefits Advisor, addressed the Board about applications received from two
members for duty disability benefits for injuries that were incurred more than 10 years before the
applications were received. Each of the members, Mr. Joseph Stanfa and Mr. Robert Warren, had
received benefits under the Illinois Workers’ Compensation Act (“IWCA”) for the periods of duty
disability that they were requesting from the Fund and submitted the required Attending Physician
Statements. The County Physician did not dispute the Attending Physicians’ evaluations regarding
the periods of disability, but notified the Fund that it would no longer provide recommendations
regarding disability for injuries that were incurred more than 10 years before the applications were
received. Mr. LeDonne noted that the members had provided the required medical documentation
about their periods of disability that were corroborated by the payments made under the IWCA, but
were not able to obtain the recommendation of the County Physician as required by Section 9-158 of
the Illinois Pension Code, as proof of their disability.
It was discussed whether the Board should adopt a policy to address applications raising these issues
or consider them on a case-by-case basis.
a. Joseph Stanfa
It was moved by Trustee Lewandowski and seconded by Trustee Goode, because the
submitted Attending Physician Statements regarding the periods of disability and the periods
for which Workers’ Compensation benefits were paid to the member are consistent with one
another and not disputed by the County physician that, for these limited circumstances, the
support for the Attending Physician Statements submitted by Mr. Joseph Stanfa be treated as
reports of a Board physician his duty disability for purposes of Section 9-158 of the Illinois
Pension Code and that the Board find that Mr. Stanfa is eligible for the duty disability
benefits requested.

b. Robert Warren
It was moved by Trustee Lewandowski and seconded by Trustee Goode, because the
submitted Attending Physician Statements regarding the periods of disability and the periods
for which Workers’ Compensation benefits were paid to the member are consistent with one
another and not disputed by the County physician that, for these limited circumstances, the
Board accept the Attending Physician Statements submitted by Mr. Robert Warren as proof
of his duty disability for purposes of Section 9-158 of the Illinois Pension Code and that the
Board find that Mr. Warren is eligible for the duty disability benefits requested.

4. Legal Report
a. Reappoint Sullivan
Margaret M. Fahrenbach, Legal Advisor, stated that the Fund had received a letter and
resume from Retired Judge James Sullivan stating that he was available to serve as a hearing
officer for administrative hearings at the Fund.
b. Request to Appoint Hearing Officer – Leslie Robbins
Ms. Fahrenbach then reported that Ms. Leslie Robbins filed a request for an administrative
hearing and asserted that the date she was eligible to receive cost of living adjustments was
not properly determined under Section 9-133. Ms. Robbins further asserted that her service
credit and final average salary were not correctly calculated. The board acknowledged the
submission and requested credential from additional candidates.
It was moved by Trustee Fitzgerald and seconded by Trustee McFadden that the Board
appoint Mr. Patrick Driscoll to serve as the hearing officer for the administrative hearing
requested by Ms. Leslie Robbins to consider whether her annuity benefit and eligibility for
cost of living adjustments were correctly determined.

December 31, 2014. Mr. Maratea stated that the County Fund required $120 million and that
the Forest Fund required $3.5 million to meet their respective obligations through December
31, 2014.

Manager search and the focus on non-core and REIT strategies. Adelante Capital Management was
selected above other finalists and was asked to make a presentation to Investment Committee at their
meeting on September 23, 2014. Callan and Fund Investment Staff then conducted final due
diligence on Adelante. The trustees discussed the active REIT strategy Adelante proposed and the
amount to be allocated to the investment by the County Fund.
It was moved by Trustee McFadden and seconded by Trustee Nester that the Board select Adelante
Capital Management for a $70 million active REIT mandate for the County Fund to be funded from
the Russell real estate ETF, subject to satisfactory completion of successful contract negotiations. It
is further moved that the Fund Investment Staff and Executive Director be authorized to take all

7. Old Business/New Business
The Board discussed the status of the County’s change to a new payroll system and inquired about
any impact the transition had on the Fund. Paul Rzeszutko, Director of Benefits, reported that the
Fund was experiencing delays in payroll reporting and that there were errors in the reports that had
been received. These problems have impeded the Fund’s ability to process annuities, disability
benefits and refunds. Trustee Wilson reported that the County has focused on accurately reporting
payroll records and has voiced the need to provide correct reports to the Fund. The Board then
asked Fund staff to prepare a letter for the County Board on its behalf describing the status of the
payroll transition and its effect on the Fund.
8. Adjournment
There being no further business before the Board, it was moved and seconded and that the trustees
adjourn the meeting.
The next Board meeting is scheduled for November 6, 2014, at 9:30 a.m.
