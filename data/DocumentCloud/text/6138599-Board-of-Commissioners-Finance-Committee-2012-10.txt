Budget Presentation of Cook County Clerk David Orr
October 29, 2012

Good afternoon Chairman Daley and County Commissioners. Thank you for your
continued support for time? and money?saving initiatives in the Cook County Clerk?s office.
I am pleased to present you with our budget for 2013

BUDGET: We are indeed doing more with less. We have undertaken
many new projects at the same time that our budget has been reduced:

Our total budget is down 13 percent since 2009, the last comparable election year.

Our 524 Elections account has been cut by 16 percent since 2009, the last year
comparable to 2013.

Our 110 account, which funds major departments other than Elections, is down 4
percent from 2012 to 2013.

Our head count has been reduced by 7 percent since 2010.

Our revenues, however, have remained steady. As attached charts will show, our Vital
Records sales have been bolstered by new products. Genealogy sales continue to climb. Our
Ethics revenues have gone up dramatically due to a combination of new fees, and online late
fee collection through our new, web?based lobbyist and SEI ?ling portals. Our overall
revenues for 2012 are on track, despite a smaller tax sale.

Our long?term strategic plan for adopting new technology, and cross?training staff to work
in several divisions has also paid off. At a time when elections are more demanding than

ever, it has enabled us to take on new responsibilities without increasing our budget or
positions. As just one example, Mail Voting is now available to all voters and the number of
requests is more than double what it was in 2008.

What?s more, our ongoing collaboration with the Chicago Board of Elections on
expenditures such as public notices will be saving money for the County as a whole.

Here are a few highlights from this year and next which illustrate our new initiatives:

HIGH-SPEED MAIL VOTE PROCESSING: In 2012 in the Elections Division, we
prepared for high volume mail voting during the March primary with the purchase of an
innovative high?speed mail ballot sorting system after the Illinois laws governing absentee
voting were changed. This was paid for with grant money, rather than county tax dollars.

certi?cates, which will appeal to partners with different last names, frequent travelers, and
same?sex couples. We hope to introduce commemorative birth certi?cates in late 2013.

GENEALOGY ENHANCEMENT: Also in the Bureau of Vital Records, we have
scanned and are indexing one million new genealogical records to market through our
Genealogy Online portal. These are our oldest records, and therefore the most coveted by
genealogists. As they become available for 24/7 purchase by genealogists world?wide, we
anticipate a bump in revenue for that portal, which has brought in $1.7 million since its
launch in July 2008?an 850 percent return on our initial investment.

ELECTRONIC POLLBOOKS: We are also adopting an innovation in 2013 in the
Elections Division in the form of e-pollbooks, which will be introduced in a trial for the
April Consolidated Election. Electronic pollbooks deployed in each precinct on Election
Day will give our judges real?time information on the status of every voter in their precinct,
without having to consult several different documents.

For example, for voters in the wrong precinct, the e-pollbook helps judges redirect them to
correct precincts in just seconds. With an e?pollbook, a judge need not consult the paper list
to tell whether someone voted early?that information will immediately appear on their
check?in screen. The e?pollbook will save on printing and delivery costs and reduce calls to
our central office on Election Day, while providing better service to voters. Finally, like the
high speed mail sorter, the e?pollbook project will be paid for largely from grants, making it a
fiscal home run.

Thank you. I am happy to answer any questions.

THE POLITICAL SCENE

THE VOTER-FRAUD MYTH

The man 10/30 1m; sfa/zedf?ar 625702;: z'mposz?orx at t/yepo?s.

BY JANE MAYER

Teresa Sharp is ?fty-three years old

and has lived in a modest single?
family house on Millsdale Street, in a
suburb of Cincinnati, for nearly thirty?
three years. A lifelong Democrat, she
has voted in every Presidential election
since she turned eighteen. So she was
agitated when an of?cial summons from

the Hamilton County Board of Elec-

tions arrived in the mail last month.
Hamilton County, which includes Cin?
cinnati, is one of the most populous re?
gions of the most ?ercely contested state
in the 2012 election. No Republican
candidate has ever won the Presidency
without carrying Ohio, and recent polls
show Barack Obama and Mitt Romney
almost even in the state- Every vote may

matter, including those cast by the seven
members of the Sharp family?Teresa,
her husband, four grown children, and
an elderly aunt?living in the lVlillsdale
Street house.

The letter, which Cited arcane legal
statutes and was printed on government
letterhead, was dated September 4th.
?You are hereby noti?ed that your right

to vote has been challenged by a quali?ed
elector,? it said. ?The Hamilton County
Board of Elections has scheduled a hear?
ing regarding your right to vote on Mon?
day, September 10th, 2012, at 8:30 AM. . . .
You have the right to appear and tes-
tify, call witnesses and be represented
by counsel.?

about her eligibility after consulting a
government?compiled list of local prop-
erties and mistakenly identifying her
house as a vacant lot.

The Sharp household had ?rst been
identi?ed as su3picious by computer soft?
ware that had been provided to the Ohio
Voter integrity Project by a national or?
ganization called True the Vote. The
software, which has been distributed to

similar groups around the country, is
used to ?ag certain households, includ-
ing those with six or more registered vot'
ers. This approach inevitably pinpointS
many lower-income residents, students,
and extended families.

True the Vote, which was founded in
2003 and is based in Houston, describes

itself as a nonpro?t organization, creatfid

?by citizens for citizens,? that aims to pro?
tect ?the rights of legitimate voters, re?
gardless of their political party.? Al?
though the group has a spontaneous
grassroots aura, it was founded by a local
Tea Party activist, Catherine Engel?
brecht, and from the start it has received
guidance ?om intensely partisan election
lawyers and political operatives, who
have spent years stoking fear about elec?
tion fraud. This cohort?Which Roll Call
has calledithe r?fvoter fraud brain mist?:?
has ?led lawsuits, released studies, tes?
ti?ed before Congress, and written opeed
columns and books. Since 2011, the
effort has spurred legislative initiatives in
thirty-seven states to require photo
identification to vote.

Engelbrecht has received especially
valuable counsel ?om one member of the
group: Hans von Spakovsky. A Republi?
can lawyer who served in the Bush Ad?
ministration, he is now a senior legal fel-
low at the Heritage Foundation, the
conservative think tank. ?Hans is very,
very helpful,? Engelbrecht said. ?He?s one
of the senior advisers on our advisory
council.? Von Spakovsky, who frequently
appears on Fox News, is the co?author,
with the columnist John Fund, of the re-
cent book ?VVho?s CountingP,? which ar?
gues that America is facing an electoral-
security crisis. ?Election fraud, whether'it?s
phony voter registrations, illegal absentee
ballots, vote?buying, shady recounts, or
old?fashioned ballot?box stuf?ng, can be
found in every part of the United States,?
tlreywrite. The book connects these mod-
ern threats with sordid episodes from the
American past: crooked inner?city ma-
chines, corrupt black bosses in the Deep
South. Von Spakovsky and Fund con-
clude that electoral fraud is a ?spreading?
danger, and declare that True the Vote
serves ?an obvious need.?

Mainstream election experts say that
Spakovsky has had an irnprobably large
impact. Richard L. Hasen, a law profes-
sor at the University of California at It?
vine, and the author of a recent book,
?The Voting Wars,? says, ?Before 2000,
there were some rumblings about Dem??
ocratic voter fraud, but it really wasn?t
part of the main discourse. But thanks to
von Spakovsky and the ?ame?fanning of
a few others, the that Democratic
voter fraud is common, and that it helps
Democrats win elections, has become

part of the Republican orthodoxy.? In

December, Reince Priebus, the chairman
of the Republican National Committee,
wrote, ?Election fraud is a real and per-
sistent threat to our electoral system.? He
accused Democrats of ?standing up for
potential trand?presumahly her-arise
ending it would rlisen?'anrhise at least
two of its Core constituencies: the de?
ceased and double-voters.? Hasen be?
lieves that Democrats, for their part, have
made exaggerated claims about the num?
ber of voters who may bedisenfranchised
by Republican election-security meae
sures. But he regards the conservative
alarmists as more success?rl. ?Their job is
really done,? Hasen says. ?It?s common
now to assert that there is a need for voter
l.D.s, even without any evidence.?

In Hamilton County alone, the new
citizens? groups have challenged more
than a thousand names since March.
Some challenges, such as those aiming to
disqualify college students who failed to
include their dorm-room numbers on
their registration forms, were tossed out
immediately. But the board accepted
nearly two hundred challenges, induding
those to twenty?six voters registered at a
trailer park that no longer existed.

In Ohio, if voters whose eligibility has
been challenged come to the polls in No~
vember, they may be forced to use a pro?
visional ballot, which will be counted
only if of?cials sanction it?"after 
tion Day. Some experts worry that voters
who have been needlessly challenged will
feel too intimidated even to show up.
?People have other things to do with
their lives than respond to inaccurate
complaints accusing them of being crim-
inals,? Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola
Law School in Los Angeles, said.

Alex Trianta?lou, a Republican mem?
ber of the county? 5 Board of Elections,
maintains that the challenges have been
nonpartisan. But Caleb Faux, a Demo?
crat on the board, says, don?t buy it. The
True the Vote people are clearly going after
Democratic voters: African-Americans,
students, and other groups they think are
likely to vote Democratic.?

Von Spakovsky recently sat down with
me in a conference room at the Heritage
Foundation, wearing rimless eyeglasses
and a sports jacket with a crisp white
pocket square. In our conversation, and
in later phone calls and e?mails, he ex--
pressed himselfwith lawyerly reserve. He
said of True the Vote and its affiliates,

?They?re doing a great job.? Earlier this
year, he noted, the Pew Center on the
States found that more than 1.8 million
people who had died were still registered
to vote in America, and that 2.75 million
people were registered to vote in multiple
states. How many of these errors trans?
late into fraudulent votes? ?It is impossi?
ble to answer,? he said. ?We don?t have
the tools in place.? But he cited a 2000 in-
vestigation, by the Atlanta journal?Con?
stitution, of voting in Georgia
over the previous two decades; the paper
reported that it had turned up ?fty?four
hundred instances of dead people being
recorded as having voted. ?That seems
pretty substantial to me,? he said.

He did not mention that the article's
?ndings were later revised. The journal?
Constitution ran a follow-up article after
the Georgia Secretary ofState?s of?ce indi-
cated that the vast majority of the cases ap?
peared to re?ect clerical errors. Upon closer
inspection, the paper admitted, its only
speci?c example of a deceased voter casti ng
a ballot didn?t hold up. The ballot of a 1ij
ing voter had been attributed to a dead
man whose name was nearly identical-

the appointed day this fall, Teresa

. Sharp drove to Cincinnati and ap-
peared before the Board of Elections.
Dressed in a T?shirt and jeans, and ac-
companied by six family members, Sharp
moved to the front of the room when her
name was called. She then ?slammed her
purse and papers on the table,? according
to Faux, who was present.

Sharp told me, ?It was like a kangaroo
court. There were, like, ninety?four peoF
ple being challenged, and my family and
I were the only ones contesting it! I
looked around. The board members and
the stenngraphcr, they were all white
people. The lady hriuging these chal-
lenges, she was white, and reminded me
of Gladys nosy neighbor
on the sitcom ?Bewitched.?

When Sharp heard her house de?
scribed as a vacant lot, and learned that
Marlene Kocher??the member of the
Ohio Voter Integrity Project who had
filed the challenge against hermhad not
bothered to visit her address, she exploded.
?This lady has nothing else better to do??
she said. think she needs to get a life'?

Faux recalled that Kocher ?apologized
and kind of shrunk back.?

made a mistake,? Mary Siegel, 2

THE NEW YOBKER, (VTOBFH 29 F: NOVEMBER 5. 20I2 

 

an:

 

leader of the Ohio Voter Integrity Proj?
ect, who has been involved in a local Tea
Party group, told me. ?We?re just here to
protect the voter. We have no idea when
We look at the registrations what color or
creed or party you are. We just look at
where your property is and how many
people are living there.?

Sharp said, think they want to stop
as many black people as they can from vot-
ing. I won?t even know until Election Day
if I got the right to vote. But if they tell me
I can?t vote?it is over. They are going to

have to call the police. I am going to jail!?

At the Heritage Foundation, von Spa?
kovsky emphasized that his devo?
tion to safeguarding voter integrity had
nothing to do with racial discrimination
or partisan gain: ?I?m not in this because
I?m on a team. I believe in having fair
elections, and I would never be willing to
do anything that would encourage or
allow cheating in an election. My inter-
est is in making sure that the person who
people vote for the most wins.?

Yet many Democrats see his cause as
a voter?suppression effort in disguise.

Thirty?three states have passed some form

ofvoter?ID. law, the most severe versions
of which demand government?issued
cards with photographs and expiration
dates. A driver? 3 license typically quali?es,
but many students, elderly people, and
poor urban residents do not have one.

According to a study by the Brennan
Center for Justice, a liberal nonpro?t in-
stitute at N.Y.U. Law School, eleven per
cent of the voting?age population lacks
the kind of ID. cards required by the
strictest states. Eighteen per cent of
Americans over the age of sixty-?ve d9
not have such documentation; among Af-
rican-Americans the ?gure is twenty??ve
per cent. Von Spakovsky criticized the
study for focussing not on registered vot-
ers but on all Americans who are eligible
to vote. He cites rival studies indicating
that the number of registered voters with?
out I.D.s is negligible.

The vast majority of the lawmakers
who have pushed for voter I.D.s have
been Republicans. As Bill Clinton has put
it, ?This is not rocket science. They are
trying to make the 2012 electorate look
more like the 2010 electorate?~?when
many young and minority voters stayed

home??than the 2008 electorate.? Clin?

ton said that the ?effort to limit the fran?
chise? was the most determined ?since we
got rid of the poll tax and all the otherJim
Crow burdens on voting.?

Republicans who support tighter
voter security say that they are not seek?
ing political advantage. But last summer
Republican House Leader,
IVIike Turzai, was caught on tape boast~
ing to colleagues that the state?s new 1D.
law was ?going to allow Governor Rom-
ney to win the state of Ear?
lier this month, a state judge suspended
the controversial law?s implementation
until after the 2012 election; a federal
court has done the same with South Car-
olina?s new ID. law.

Congressman John Lewis, the Demo?
crat from Georgia, says of recent efforts to
tighten voting requirements, thought
we?d passed this long ago. But it seems
we must ?ght this ?ght over and over.?
In the nineteen?sixties, Lewis was beaten
by police while demonstrating in sup?
port of civil-rights legislation, includ:
ing the Voting Rights Act. He said of
von Spakovsky, ?He?s been the moving
force behind photo I.D.s. I don?t know
if it?s something in the water he?s been
drinking . . . but over the years he?s been
hellbent to make it more dif?cult?al?
ways, always?for people to vote. It?s like
he goes to bed dreaming about this, and
gets up in the morning wondering, What
can I do today to make it more di??icult
for people to vote? When you pull back
the covers, peel back the onion, he?s the
one who?s gotten the Republican legisla-
tures, and the Republican Party, to go
along with this?even though there is no
voter fraud to speak of; He?s trying to cre?
ate a cure where sickness-?

Earlier this year, atak'fianel sponsored
by the conservative organization Judicial
Watch, von Spakovsky said that it was
?preposterous? for anyone to liken the na?
tionwide crackdown on voter irregulari?
ties to ?the restoration ofJim Crow.? In
support of his views, he cites a liberal
icon: the former Supreme Court Justice
John Paul Stevens. In 2008, Stevens
helped uphold Indiana?s strict voter?ID.
law in the face of a challenge from Dem?
ocrats. He wrote, ?Examples of such fraud
in other parts of the country have been

history by respected historians and jour-
nalists," denionstratmg "that not onlyis

a?ect the outcome of a close election.?
Nearly all scholars of America?s sys?
tem of locally run elections acknowledge
chronic problems, including administra-
tive incompetence, sloppy registration
rolls, unreliable machinery, vote buying,
and absentee?ballot fraud. But Robert
Brandon, the president of the Fair Elec?
tions Legal Network and a longtime re-
former, says that the current debate,
?which is about people impersonating
another voter, is silly.? He adds, "You
can?t steal an election one person at a
time. You can by striding ballot lantes? -
but voter ills won't stop that."
lv'on offered me the names
oftwo experts who, he said, would con?nn
that voter?impersonation fraud posed a
signi?cant peril: Robert Pastor, the direc?
tor ofthe Center for Democracy and Flees
tion Nlanagcment, at American Univer-
sity, and lrarry Sabato, a political science
professor at the University of Virginia.
Pastor, von Spakovsky noted, had spoken
to the US. Commission on Civil Rights
about being a victim of election fraud: vot-
ing in Georgia, he discovered that some?
one else had alreadyvoted under his name.
When i reached Pastor, be clari?ed
what had happened to him. ?i think they
just mistakenly checked my name when
my son voted-it was just a mistake." le
added, ?1 don?t Think that voter-imper-
sonation fraud is a serious problem.? Pas;
tor believes that, compared with other de-
mocracies, America is ?somewhere near
the bottom in election administration,?
and thinks mat voter ills make sense?
but only if they are free and easily available
to all, which, he points out, .is not what
Republican legislatures have proposed.
Sabato, who supports the use of voter
1.D.s under the same basic conditions,
says of the voter?impersonation question,
?One ?audulent vote is one too many, but
my sense is that it's relatively rare today.?
Hasen says that, while researching
?The Voting Wars," he ?tried to ?nd a sin?
gle case" since 1930 when ?an election out~
come could plausibly have tamed on voter?
impersonation fraud.? He couldn?t ?nd
one. News21, an investigative?journalism
group, has reported that voter imperson?
ation at the polls is a ?virtually non- enstent"
problem. After conducting an exhaus-
tive analysis of election?crime prosecu~
lions since 2000, it identified only SEVEN
convictions for impersonation fraud.
None of those cases involved conspiracy.

Lorraine Minnite, a public-policy
professor at Rutgers, collated decades of
electoral data for her 2010 book, "The
[Ill-V0123? Fraud," and came up with
some striking statistics. in .2005, for ere
ample, the federal goveouncnt charged
many more Amedouis with violating mi?
gnrtory-hi rd statutes than with 
ing election liaud, which has long been a
felony. She told me, ?ll makes no sense
for individual voters to impersonate
someone. It?s like committing a felony at
the police station, with virtually no chance,
of affecting the election outcome.? Are?
port by the Times in 2007 also found elec?
tion fraud to be rare. During the Bush
Administration, the Justice Department
initiated a ?ve?year crackdown on voter
fraud, but only eighty?six people were
convicted of any kind of election crime.

Hasen, who calls von Spakovsky a
leading member of ?the Fraudulent Fraud
Squad,? told me that he respects many
other conservative advocates in his area of
expertise, but dismisses scholars who al?
lege widespread voter-impersonation
fraud. ?1 see them as foot soldiers in the
Republican army,? he says. ?It?s just a way
to excite the base. They are hucksters.
They? re providing fake scholarly support.
They?re not playing fairly with the Etc?.
And think they know it.?

on Spakovsky is the son of a Ger-

man mother and a Russian father
who met in Bavaria, just after the Sec-
ond World War, at an American?run
camp for displaced persons. They immi?
grated to the United States in 1951. His
father, Anatol, was a White Russian
who fraught Communism twice: ?rst
against the Bolsheviks, in Russia, and
later against Tito, in Yugoslavia, where
he lived before heading to Bavaria. L?l?le
escaped death many times," vou Spa?
recalled. "He taught me to stand
up for what believe in. no matter what
the cost, and have taken that to heart."
Von Spakovsky says that his heritage has
made him especially appreciative of
American democracy and sensitive to
what he calls its ?fragiliqr.?

In America, his parents settled in
Huntsville, Alabama, where his father
taugl'it philosophy at a local college and
wrote poetry. ?He was the most intelli-
gent and cultured person I have ever
known," von Spakovsky said, adding that

family dinners were more stimulating

than the local schools he attended. Ale
though the civil-rights movement created
tumult in Alabama during his childhood,
he says that he has no memory of it.

After graduating from M.I.T. and
Vanderbilt Law School, von Spakovsky

was expecting a very boring day," he
says. Instead, he observed election o?icials
tasking voters which party they belonged
to, "which, of course, you're not supposed
to do in a general election. So the verylirst
time I'm a poll watcher, I Walk in and
something illegal is going on.?

It was 1992, a taming point in Amer?
ican election law. Throughout the nine-
teen?eighties, civilerights groups brought
discrimination cases against local election
of?cials, particularly in the South, alleg?
ing that bureaucratic barriers?such as re?
quiring people to register at local clerks?
of?ces?served mainly to intimidate
new voters, many ofwhom were minori-
ties. llv'oting-rights activists pushed for na-
tional legislation that wotdd encourage
mass entranchisement, such as permitting
people to register when they got a driver' 
license, or to register by mail. Congress
passed a bill with these provisions, but
President George H. W. Bush vetoed it.
Soon after Bill Clinton took of?ce, in
1993, he signed the bill, which became
the National 1Voter Registration Act?-
also known as the motor?voter law. As
minority?voter registration surged, con?
servatives began warning that permitting
more lenient forms of registration opened
the door to fraud.

In 199?, von Spakovsky agitated
against the National Voter Registration
Act and in favor of strict requirements, in?
cluding the presentation ofbirth certi??
cates, for voter ills, in order ?to prevent
impostors From voting.? He became a Rt:
publican appointee to an election board
in the Atlanta area, which had a fast-
growing, iuo'easingly black population.
Writing for the Georgia Public Policy
Foundation, a conservative research center,
he warned that aspects of the National
Voter Registration Act might ?destroy the
security and integrity of the votereregisu?am
tiou system.? The article also recom-
mended rcgular purges of voter rolls.

By 1999. von Spakovsky had begun
attracting national attention. He was the

chairman of the Fulton County Republi?
can Party, and served on the advisory
board of the Voting Integrity Project, or
new group, based in Arlington,
Virginia. V.I.P. called itselfa nonpartisan
election?reform group, but it had deep ties
to the Republican Party and to the na?
tional conservative movement. One of
its founders, Helen Blackwell, was mar?
ried to Morton Blackwell, a former Rea?
gan aide and the founder of the Leader?
ship Institute, an organization that trains
ultraeconservative young activists. (In
2009, one Of them, the guerrilla videogra?
pher James O?Keefe, took undercover
footage meant to suggest pervasive crim?
inality at ACORN, the progressive non?
pro?t group, some of whose employees
had pleaded guilty to voter?registration
fraud. Although the footage was widely
condemned as misleading, the contro-
versy helped lead to demise.)

V.I.P. embraced von Spakovsky?s call
for voter?roll purges. In 1999, the group
met with and gave an award for ?innova?
tive excellence? to a company called Da?
tabase Technologies, which was design?
ing the State of Florida?s procedure for
scrubbing its voter rolls of felons and other
ineligible people. In 2000, Database?s pro-
cess led, notoriously, to the erroneous dis?
enfranchisement of thous ands of voters?
most of them Democrats and many of
them black. Asked about this, von Spa?
kovsky said, heatedly, was in Atlanta,
andI had nothing to do with the com-
pany that Florida hired to clean up its
election rolls.?

Von Spakovsky did, however, get di-
rectly involved in the infamous recount
of the Presidential vote in Florida. Serv~
ing as a volunteer observer for the carn?
paign of George W. Bush, he spent time
in Jacksonville, where black leaders pro?
tested that their voting rights had been
denied, and in Palm Beach County,
where twenty?eight thousand ballots
Went uncounted, because examiners con?
cluded that they had not been ?lled out
properly. According to the Palm Beach
Post, nearly half of those discarded ballots
came ?'om predominantly black and el?
derly precincts. Von Spakovsky, for his
part, recalled the drama on the ground as
less than thrilling: ?It was a lesson in how
really boring vote counting can be.?

After the recount trauma, the Bush
Administration announced its crack?
down on election fraud, and hired von

Spakovsky as a lawyer in the Justice De?
partr'nent?s newly invigorated voting sec?
tion, which enforces the Voting Rights
Act. He was soon promoted, becoming
counsel to the assistant attorney general
in charge of the civil?rights division.

The crackdown was infused with par-
tisanship. In 2006, the Justice Depart-
ment ?red two US. Attorneys, in part
because top Administration of?cials felt
that theywere too soft on potential Dem-
ocratic voter fraud in New Mexico and
Washington. In 2008, documents un??
earthed by an inspector general revealed
that the push to prosecute had as much to
do with political gain as with the pursuit
of justice. Republican o?icials in New
Mexico pressured David Iglesias, the
US. Attorney for the state, to prosecute
Democrats before the 2004 election. A
lawyer for the state Republican Party
wrote that the voter-ID. ?issue should be
used (now) at all levels,? adding, ?You are
not going to ?nd a better wedge issue.?
But an election-fraud task force that Igle-
sias formed with the F.B.I. found no
crimes to prosecute. Because of his failure
to ?nd fraud, the inspector general con?
cluded, Iglesias was ?red. (He is now a
prosecutor in Guantanamo Bay.) John
McKay, the U.S. Attorney in Washing-
ton State, was also ?red after failing to
?nd prosecutable voter fraud.

In 2006, President Bush appointed
von Spakovsky to the Federal Election
Commission While the Senate was in re?
cess. When he came up for con?rmation,

six career lawyers in the voting section
wrote a scathing letter of protest, saying
that he had a ?cavalier? disregard for
legal precedent. They noted that a fed?
eral court had struck down Washington
State?s attempt to implement his recom?
mendation that eligible citizens be kept
?off the rolls for typos and other mis-
takes by election o?icials.? They accused
von Spakovsky of overruling their judg?
ment that a strict voter?ID. law in

Georgia would result in substantially

fewer black voters, and of using a pseu?
donym to publish an essay in support of
voter?ID. laws while the department
was weighing the case. A judge in Geor-
gia struck down the law, likening it to a
poll tax. (After considerable modi?-
cations, the law was authorized.)

Joe Rich, the former chief of the vot?
ing section, repeatedly clashed with von
Spakovsky and his allies. worked at the
Justice Department for thirty?six years,
twenty?four of them under Republican
Administrations,? Rich told me, ?The
disdain and antagonism that they had for
the experience, expertise, and dedication
of career civil?rights attorneys was some?
thing I had never experienced before. It
was just awful.?

mong the lawmakers who spoke out
against von Spakovsky?s appoint?
ment to the REC. was Barack Obama,
then a Democratic senator from Illinois.
He put a hold on the con?rmation, effec?
tively blocking it. After two years in limbo,
von Spakovsky withdrew his name from
consideration, and joined the Heritage
Foundation, where he continued to in-
veigh against voter fraud.

In the spring of 2008, as Obama was
the Democratic nomination for
President, von Spakovsky issued a 
report on electoral fraud, titled ?Stolen
Identities, Stolen Votes.? In an op?ed
piece on the Fox News Web site, he ar?
gued that ?one doesn?t have to look far to
find instances of ??audulent ballots cast in
actual elections by ?voters? who were the
?grnents of active imaginations.? Yet the
most recent evidence he cited in his re?
port was decades old: a grand?jury report
documenting criminal collusion, from
1968 to 1982, among Brooklyn election
of?cials and local machine politicians.

Richard Hasen asked to see the grand?
jury report, but von Spakovsky did not re?
spond. (?What am I?his research assis?
taut?? he asked me-) Hasen has another
explanation for von Spakovsky?s refusal to
produce the document: ?He must have
known it was weak." Hasen eventuall
hunted dt'iwn his 01am copy. On his blog,
he ()h?ervcd, ?Most Of took
place forty years agO,? adding, ?When
election of?cials collude with those corn?
mitting fraud, 3 voter?ID. reqUirement
would not help in the slightest.? Asked
about this, von Spakovsky said, ?That?s
not what the grand jury said. They recom?

?Uh. rliat it should he studied as one of

The election of 2008 was a milestone
in terms of turnout. The percentage of
A?jcan?Amencans who voted (sixty??ve)
rivallcd the percentage of whites who
Voted (sixty-six). Penda Hair, the co?
director of the Advancement Project, a
Progressive voting?rights advocacy group,
says that thisstatistic discom?ted Repub-
licans. ?Conservatives were looking at it
and saying, We?ve got to clamp things
down,? Hair said. ?They?d always tried to
suppress the black vote, but it was then
that they came up with new schemes.?

After Obama took of?ce, v0n Spa-
kovsky expanded his campaign for voter?
I.D. laws and other ballot?security mea-
sures. One receptive forum, where he
spoke repeatedly, was the American Leg?
islative Exchange Council, or 
conservative, corporate-funded group
that drafts legislative models for thou-
sands of state lawmakers. In 2009, after
the Supreme Court upheld Indiana?s
voter?II). law, ALEC drafted a sample
voter?TD. bill for other states to copy.
An accompanying essay in the organiza?
tion?s newsletter aplained how to frame
such restrictions so that they would pass
muster with the courts. Copycat bills
emerged in state legislatures across the
country. In 2011 and 2012, Republicans
proposed sixty?two such laws, in thirty?
seven state legislatures. News21 has re?
ported that more than half of these bills
were sponsored by associates of ALEC.
Lisa Graves, the executive director of
the Center for Media and Democracy,
which runs a Web site called ALEC Ex?
posed, says, ?Unlike a think tank, ALEC
operationalizes the agenda, nationally.?

Von Spakovsky said, ?The idea that
there?s some deep conspiracy is just laugh?
able.? His own work, however, has sug-
gested that liberals engage in conspiracies.
?VVho?s Counting?? opens with an insin?
uating account of how Al Franken, the
lVlinnesota Democrat, was elected to the
Senate in 2008. According to the book,
there is ?cnnipcll'u evidence, compiled
by a cil'izens? watchdog group, that "1,099

ter is ?Would Obarnacare have passed
without voter fraud??

Fox News and other conservative
media outlets have promoted this argu?
ment. However, Mike Freeman, the
Hennepin County Attorney, who over-
sees lVlinneapolis, told 1116, ?Those num-
bers are fraudulent. We investigated, and
at the end of the day, out of over four
hundred allegations in the county, we
charged thirty-eight people. Their re?
search was bad, sloppy, incredible. They
are just liars.? Some Of the targeted vot?
ers weren?t actually felons; others were on
probation and hadn?t realized that they
remained ineligible to vote. To be con?
victed of voter fraud, a suspect needs to
have criminal intent.

Von Spakovsky told me, ?It doesn?t
matter whether felons?
?intended it or not. The point is they did
vote.? The subject of electoral fraud is
now front and center in lV?nnesota: in
November, the state will have a referen-
dum on a state voter-1D. law.

Von Spakovsky has also presented a
more recent case as a scandal. Last year, in
an op?ed piece that was nationally syndi?
cated, he wrote, 2010 election in Ms?
souri that ended in a one-vote margin of
victory included 50 votes cast illegally by
citizens of Somalia.? He told me that these
voters ?could only speak Somali, even
though to become a US. citizen you must
learn English.? Once again, when the case
was examined by a judge, no fraud was
found. Although the judge?s ruling had

been issued before the column appeared,

von Spakovsky didn?t mention it. He told
me that the omission was justi?ed, be?
cause the judge hadn?t investigated ?the
citizenship issue.? Yet the voters? citizen~
ship was never in doubt. Translation assis?
tance is available at the polls?citizens
sometimes have shaky English?and the
court had found merely that election
of?cials had not made the voters take an
oath before receiving help, as state law re?
qun'ed. The judge determined that such a
mistake ?should not result in the disen-
franchisement of the voters.?

With legions of citizen watchdogs on
the lookout for fraud, voters confused
about the documents necessary to vote,
and the country almost evenly divided p0?
litically, von Spakovsky is predicting that
November 6th could be even more chaotic
than the 2000 elections. He will play a di-
rect role in Virginia, a swing state, where
he is the vice?chairman of the electoral
board of Fairfax County. Joining us at the
conference table at the Heritage Foun-
dation, John Fund, von Spakovsky?s co-
author, told me, ?If it?s close this time, I
think we?re going to have three or four
Floridas.? Von Spakovsky shook his head
and said, ?lfwe?re lucky only three or four.?
Ifthere are states where the number of
provisional ballots cast exceeds the mar?
gin of victory, he predicts, ?there will
probably be horrendous ?ghts, and litiga-
tion between the lawyers that will make
the ?ghts over hanging chads look minor
by comparison.? Pursing his lips, he added,
hope it doesn?t happen.? But, if it does,
no one will be more ready for the ?ght. 9
