Submitting report relative to Joe Louis Arena Amended and Restated Brownfield Plan PA
381 of 1996. (As we indicated in our initial report on the first JLA Brownfield plan,
City Council should be advised that to-date, no developer has been identified to
develop the proposed multi-million mixed use project to follow the demolition of the
JLA, which is necessary to generate the tax increment financing to repay the $10
million MSF loan. If the costs of the demolition exceeds $10 million and reaches $12
million as it is now estimated, the OCFO will need to identify funds to address the $2
million gap. If approved by Council and implemented as planned, ideally this project
will ultimately result in a commercially viable project. So, if this works out as
planned, the newly constructed project will generate the tax increment financing to
repay the CRP loan.) (REFERRED TO THE PLANNING AND ECONOMIC
