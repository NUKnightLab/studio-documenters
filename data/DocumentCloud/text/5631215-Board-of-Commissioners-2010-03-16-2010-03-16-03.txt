GENERAL BACKGROUND
The Board passed Resolution No. 2009-CHA-153 on October 15, 2009 authorizing a 1-year
extension to the contract to Aon, as Broker of Record for the PMIP. One of Aon’s duties as CHA’s
Broker of Record is to competitively solicit bids for insurance coverage on behalf of CHA.
The PMIP ensures that Private Management Companies have the necessary insurance coverage
contractually required by CHA. All costs associated with the program (insurance premiums, claim
and broker administration fees), are deducted from the participating Private Management Companies'
operating budgets.

 MBE/WBE/DBE participation has been waived as currently there is no MBE/WBE/DBE insurance
company which can meet the standard criteria set forth by CHA that insurance providers carry a
minimum rating of “A” by the A.M. Best Rating Guide.

PROCUREMENT HISTORY
Aon directly and indirectly (through one wholesaler) solicited requests for insurance premium quotes
from 9 insurance carriers on January 9, 2009 and requested that their quotes be received by Aon on
February 5, 2010. Aon received four quotes for General Liability and 3 quotes for Excess Liability.
Due to the new contracts with the Private Property Management firms, Workers Compensation,
Crime and Auto Liability insurance will not be included in the PMIP, but will instead be provided by
the individual firms.
This was the first time in over ten years that multiple insurance carriers were willing to quote both
the General and Excess Liability coverages. Last year, Aon was able to obtain competitive quotes
for only the General Liability. This year using CHA’s improving claims history combined with the
interest generated over the past several years by Aon, several insurance carriers provided competitive
quotes for both General and Excess Liability. With its monopoly gone due to increased competion,
Lexington, the incumbent carrier, did not provide competitive pricing for the General and Excess
Liability. Not only do the premiums offered by Liberty Mutual, Illinois Union and AXIS provide a
cost savings of 31% to the CHA from this past year’s premiums, but the retention levelhas been
reduced from $750,000 to $250,000.
Based on the foregoing, it is in the best interest of the CHA to enter into contracts with Liberty
Mutual Insurance Company for General Liability and Illinois Union and AXIS Surplus Insurance
Companies for Excess Liability insurance, in the aggregate amount not-to-exceed $1,129.759 for the
CHA’s PMIP for the period of April 1, 2010 through March 31, 2011.
