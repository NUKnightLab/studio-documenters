PROPOSED ORDINANCES
Transmitting a Communication, dated March 13, 2007 from
ROBERTO MALDONADO, County Commissioner
I am submitting the following ordinance entitled, “Affirmative Action/Equal Employment Opportunity
Ordinance,” for the Main Agenda of the March 20, 2007 Cook County Board meeting. I will request that
this item be referred to the appropriate committee for further review and discussion.
Prior to the massive layoffs of Cook County employees as a result of the FY2007 Budget, both a
preliminary statistical analysis known as the “Cook County Employee Diversity Representation Report,”
and a subsequent four year retroactive analysis of the County’s work force (submitted for your review),
demonstrated a striking disparity in minority hiring among many of Cook County’s public offices. The
layoff of thousands of employees may have further eroded any slight improvements the County has made
recently in attempting to balance the diversity of the workforce.
As County government moves forward in restructuring its workforce, it is crucial that the County take
affirmative action consistent with law with respect to the hiring, retention and promotion of persons who
have historically been discriminated against because of race, ethnicity, and gender to prevent and
eliminate discrimination and to balance the County’s work force. To achieve this end, it is necessary for
the County to codify the affirmative action policy and procedure of the County and to give such policy
and procedure the full force of the County’s lawmaking powers.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 20, 2007
PROPOSED ORDINANCE
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION/EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY ORDINANCE
PREAMBLE
WHEREAS, the County of Cook, Illinois is a home rule unit of local government pursuant to Article VII,
Section 6 (a) of the 1970 Illinois Constitution, and pursuant to the authority therein granted may exercise
any power and perform any function pertaining to its government and affairs; and
WHEREAS, equal employment opportunity is the law of the land, pursuant to Title VII of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964, as amended by the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972, codified at 42
U.S.C. § 2000e et seq.; and
WHEREAS, the policy of the County is to provide equal employment opportunities for persons from all
segments of the County community without regard to race, color, sex, age, religion, disability, national
origin, ancestry, sexual orientation, marital status, parental status, military discharge status, source of
income, housing, or any other protected category established by law, statute or ordinance; and
WHEREAS, the Equal Employment Opportunity Coordinating Council’s Policy Statement on
Affirmative Action, 41 C.F.R. § 60-3.17, notes in pertinent part: “On the one hand, vigorous enforcement
of the laws against discrimination is essential. But equally, and perhaps even more important are
affirmative voluntary efforts on the part of public employers to assure that positions in the public service
are genuinely and equally accessible to qualified persons, without regard to their sex, racial, or ethnic
characteristics. Without such efforts equal employment is no more than a wish;” and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Bureau of Human Resources currently operates in accordance with the
policy known as the “Cook County Equal Employment Opportunity Plan” for offices under the President;
and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners desires to codify this affirmative action policy
and procedure and to give such policy and procedure the full force of the County's lawmaking powers;
and
WHEREAS, the first step in the construction of any affirmative action plan is an analysis of the
employer’s work force to determine whether percentages of persons within race, ethnic, gender, or sexual
orientation groups in individual job classifications are substantially similar to the percentages persons
within those groups who are available in the relevant job market and who possess the basic job-related
qualifications; and
WHEREAS, when substantial disparities are found, the next step is to examine each element of the
overall selection process to identify elements which operate to exclude persons on the basis of race,
ethnicity, gender, or sexual orientation; and
WHEREAS, both a preliminary statistical analysis known as the “Cook County Employee Diversity
Representation Report,” and a subsequent four year retroactive analysis of the County’s work force,
substantiate a striking disparity in minority hiring among many of Cook County’s public offices.

another business entity, subsequently participates in the preparation of a proposal or bid which is
submitted in response to the competitive bid or RFP at issue. These professional consultants shall be

WHEREAS, the County’s budget process is greatly hampered by the lack of specificity in job titles,
duties and responsibilities; and

fact the Director of Business and International Affairs, charged with establishing trade partnerships with
foreign countries; and

Resources, be presented for review by the Board of Commissioners and the President’s Office by July 1,
2007 in anticipation of the timely development of the FY2008 budget.

1. Amendment to an Intergovernmental Agreement between the County of Cook and the Village of East
Hazel Crest

Wood Street to Ashland Avenue
in the Village of East Hazel Crest in County Board District #5
Section: 04-B8431-08-PV
Centerline Mileage: 0.41 miles
Fiscal Impact: ($298,271.00 - Deduction) from the Motor Fuel Tax Fund (600-600 Account)
Previously, your Honorable Body approved an Intergovernmental Agreement on July 12, 2006,
wherein the Agreement identified certain funding contributions, including from Federal sources,
secured by the Village, and cost responsibilities, including by the County. This amendment reflects
additional Federal funding in the amount of $393,571.00 secured by the Village and allocated toward
the County’s improvement construction costs. In consideration of said additional funding, the Village
is relieved of any cost obligations to the County for water main and commuter lot construction that
are included as part of the County’s improvements. The County’s share of construction costs is
reduced from an estimated $3,820,000.00 to reflect said additional federal funding ($393,571.00 less
previous Village costs of $95,300.00) to an estimated net County cost of $3,521,729.00.

improvements along 171st Street from Wood Street to Ashland Avenue (Cook County Section: 04B8431-08-PV) with reimbursement from Federal sources secured by the Village; that said Amendment
reflects additional Federal funding in the amount of $393,571.00 secured by the Village and allocated
toward County’s improvement construction costs; that in consideration of said additional funding, the
Village is relieved of any cost obligations to the County for water main and commuter lot construction
that are included as part of the County’s improvements along 171st Street; that the County’s improvement
cost is amended by reducing its share of construction costs to reflect said additional Federal funds

cost of $3,521,729.00; and, the Highway Department is authorized and directed to return an executed
copy of this Resolution with Amendment to the Village of East Hazel Crest to evidence the formal
Agreement hereby resulting, and be bound by the terms thereof on behalf of the County of Cook.

DEPARTMENT OF PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT
HOME INVESTMENT PARTNERSHIPS PROGRAM
Transmitting a Communication, dated February 26, 2007 from
PETER C. NICHOLSON, Director, Department of Planning and Development
Re:

HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME Program)

respectfully request approval of a HOME Investment Partnerships Program loan to be used for the
rehabilitation of approximately seven (7) single-family homes for low- and very-low income households
in the City of Berwyn in County Board District #16. The project complies with the HOME Program
regulations and furthers the goals of the Five-Year Consolidated Community Development Plan approved
by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
The HOME Program loan of $300,000.00 will be made between the City of Berwyn and the County of
Cook. Approval of this loan will enable the City of Berwyn to expand their current Community
Development Block Grant (CDBG) funded Owner-Occupied Single-Family Rehabilitation Program.
Permanent liens are placed on the properties for the amount of the rehabilitation by the Village. After
rehabilitation is completed, the City of Berwyn then assigns the note, owner’s participation agreement,
and junior mortgage to Cook County. The Cook County HOME Program will recapture funds expended
on the projects when these homes are sold, transferred, or otherwise alienated and title is transferred.
I respectfully request approval of this project, and that the Chief Administrative Officer of the County of
Cook, or his designee, be authorized to execute on behalf of the County of Cook, any and all documents
necessary to further the project approved herein, including, but not limited to the Subgrantee Agreement
and any modifications thereto. The necessary documents will be reviewed and approved by the State’s
Attorney’s Office. Approval of this grant by this Honorable Body will permit staff to move forward with
this project.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: None. Grant funded amount: $300,000.00. (772-292 Account).

SECTION 11
Your Committee was presented with the Revenue Report for the three-month period ended February 28,
2007 for the Corporate, Public Safety and Health Funds submitted by the Cook County Comptroller.
Commissioner Quigley requested a comparison of current patient revenues to the amount collected at this
point in the previous fiscal year.
Joseph M. Fratto, Interim Cook County Comptroller, stated that he will provide the Commissioners with
the requested information.
Chairman Daley suggested that in the future, comparative figures should be included in the report.
Commissioner Schneider asked if there were plans to address a potential revenue shortfall this year.
Thomas J. Glaser, Chief Operating Officer, Bureau of Health Services, stated that a significant amount of
time was spent in trying to negotiate a contract with ACS, but the negotiations were unsuccessful. At this
time, other options are under consideration. For example, the Bureau has consulted with officials of the
Metropolitan Chicago Healthcare Council (MCHC). MCHC has experience in patient revenue
collections, and their advice may be helpful.
Commissioner Schneider inquired whether Mr. Glaser is comfortable with the projection that the
additional $43 million in projected revenue formerly associated with the ACS contract will be collected in
Fiscal Year 2007.
Mr. Glaser responded in the affirmative.
Commissioner Moreno stated that he had meetings with representatives from the University of Illinois
Hospital; he is aware that they have the same software that the Bureau of Health Services currently uses
for handling patient billing and intake.
Commissioner Moreno inquired whether anyone from the Bureau of Health Services has contacted the
University of Illinois Hospital to see if they can offer assistance.

1209

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 20, 2007
Mr. Glaser stated that part of the ACS technology contract called for an assessment of the current
software, and this has been completed. Further, Mr. Glaser stated that the assessment identified
approximately 200 deficiencies that are now being addressed.
Commissioner Suffredin asked John Cookinham, Chief Financial Officer, Bureau of Health Services, if
he concurs with Mr. Glaser, and what other observations he can give the Commissioners.
Mr. Cookinham stated that his top priority since joining the staff of the Bureau of Health Services has
involved collecting past due receivables. He has focused on receivables that are past 60 days old, and the
Bureau will try to accelerate the collection on those items. With Medicaid items, there is a limited time
frame to collect, and the Bureau wants to make sure that they collect as much as possible before time
expires. Mr. Cookinham compared the Bureau of Health Services to a private sector healthcare system,
and identified possible improvements in infrastructure, reports, and tools to manage receivables.
Commissioner Suffredin asked if a waiver from the Federal or State Government could be obtained to go
back further than the allowed time frame for recouping past billings.
Mr. Cookinham stated that a time frame of twelve months for Medicaid and eighteen months for
Medicare is allowed. He is unsure if a waiver could be obtained, but will investigate that possibility.
Commissioner Suffredin asked if patient billings for Medicaid and Medicare are currently up to date.
Mr. Cookinham responded that a monitoring system is now under development so the Bureau can report
this on a regular basis.
Chairman Daley suggested that after the reporting system is implemented, monthly reports should be
submitted to the County Comptroller and distributed to the Commissioners.
Vice Chairman Sims asked about the aging schedule used to determine when debt becomes uncollectible.
Mr. Glaser stated that he intends to bring this issue before the Board in order to clear the accounts
receivable ledger of claims as far back as 2001. He will suggest a new aging schedule that allows the
Bureau to perform write-offs on a monthly basis.
Vice Chairman Sims asked what is the estimated bad debt is at this point.
Mr. Glaser responded approximately $460 million.
Commissioner Steele inquired about the status of the proposed Blue Ribbon Committee to address
reforms within the Bureau.
Dr. Robert R. Simon, Interim Chief, Bureau of Health Services, stated that he has met with a number of
key officials, and this conversation is ongoing.
President Stroger stated that they are working to put together a committee that will be outside of the
Bureau that can look at what is being done and give back a report that the Bureau is doing a good job and
heading in the right direction.
President Stroger stated his support for this initiative, and further stated that he would welcome
suggestions from the Commissioners regarding individuals in the healthcare industry who would agree to
serve on the committee.

1210

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 20, 2007
Commissioner Maldonado asked for a detailed category breakdown of the $460 million in uncollectible
bad debt.
Mr. Glaser stated that he does not have the information available at this time, but he assumes that it tracks
with the Bureau’s standard payer mix, i.e., 47% is self-pay, 13% Medicare, 10% commercial and other,
and 30% is Medicaid.
Commissioner Silvestri suggested that Dr. Simon submit a written report addressing absenteeism rates at
the Bureau’s four hospitals.
COMMISSIONER QUIGLEY, SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER SILVESTRI, MOVED TO
RECEIVE AND FILE THE REVENUE REPORT FOR THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED
FEBRUARY 28, 2007. THE MOTION CARRIED.

County met pursuant to notice on Tuesday, March 13, 2007 at the hour of 10:00 A.M. in the Board Room,
Room 569, County Building, 118 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois.
Your Committee has considered the following items and, upon adoption of this report, the
recommendations are as follows:
285186

DEPARTMENT OF OFFICE TECHNOLOGY, by Mary Jo Horace, Director, transmitting a
Communication:
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with PRO-WEST
AND ASSOCIATES, INC., Walker, Minnesota, for the creation of GIS spatial datasets.
Reason:

After the completion of the Request for Proposal (RFP) process for the selection
of a company to provide geographic spatial datasets to enhance Cook County’s
enterprise-wide GIS database, Pro-West and Associates, Inc. is being
recommended based on its ability to meet all technical specifications at the
lowest cost of all proposals.
The geographical database products will support a range of applications
dependent upon an accurate and complete inventory of the features found in the
physical and social landscape of the county. All of the GIS technical tasks will
be done to the Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGBC) standard for
geospatial products for all of its data layers that the county has adopted. This
will allow the county to continue to share data with local municipalities that we
currently share data.
1224

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 20, 2007
The geographic data will be produced based on the needs of the following
agencies: the Department of Building and Zoning, the Zoning Board of Appeals,
the Forest Preserve District of Cook County, Assessor’s Office, the Emergency
Telephone System Board and the Sheriff’s Police Department.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: $227,410.00. Contract period: May 1, 2007 through April 30,
2008. (545-441 Account). Requisition No. 75450004.
Approval of this item would commit Fiscal Year 2007 and future year funds.

O’Leary dated March 9, 2007. Also entered into the record was a letter dated March 12, 2007, in
response to Commissioner Daley from Catherine Maras O’Leary. (The referenced documents are on file
in the Office of the County Clerk.)
Chairman Beavers inquired to what extent there is MBE participation in this contract.
Alan Hobscheid, Systems Analyst, GIS Division, Department of Office Technology, replied that there is
37% MBE participation in this contract.
Vice Chairman Gorman, seconded by Commissioner Steele, moved the approval of Communication
Number 285186. The motion carried.
285187

transmitting a Communication:
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with SYSTEM
SOLUTIONS, INC., Northbrook, Illinois, for computer hardware, software, peripherals and
support services with an option to renew for two additional years.
Reason:

This contract is needed to allow county agencies to acquire and support computer
equipment related to new technology initiatives and replacement of outdated
equipment due to computer obsolescence. By offering a countywide computer
contract, county agencies will be able to acquire hardware that meet the
technology standards established by the Bureau of Information Technology and
Automation. This contract will allow the county to receive the State of Illinois
pricing level of 20-23% discount on desktops, workstations, and laptops and 2528% discount on servers.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $4,000,000.00. Contract period: April 1, 2007 through March 31,

Sufficient funds have been appropriated to cover this request.
*Referred to the Committee on Information Technology and Automation on March 1,
2007.

1225

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 20, 2007
Commissioner Steele voiced concern that, by including a two-year extension in the contract, productivity
will be harder to monitor.
Catherine Maras O’Leary, Chief Information Officer, Bureau of Information Technology and
Automation, replied that thus far the company has proved very productive.
Vice Chairman Gorman inquired as to how many companies have bid on this contract.
Mary Jo Horace, Director, Department of Office Technology, replied that there were eleven bids the first
year, and eight bids the second year.
Vice Chairman Gorman, seconded by Commissioner Goslin, moved the approval of
Communication Number 285187. The motion carried.
285188

DEPARTMENT OF OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY, by Mary Jo Horace, Director,
transmitting a Communication:
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with ASAP
SOFTWARE, Buffalo, New York, for countywide non-Microsoft software, support services
agreement with a three-year extension option.
Reason:

By entering into a contract with ASAP Software (a preferred large account
governmental reseller), Cook County will be able to capitalize on the State of
Illinois pricing level for the acquisition of software. The average savings is 2440% over off-the self purchasing for software and 40-50% for software support
services.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $600,600.00. Contract period: April 1, 2007 through March 31,
