PROPOSED RESOLUTION
REGARDING PURSUIT BY THE COOK COUNTY STATE'S ATTORNEY'S OFFICE
OF HOSPITALS NEGLIGENT IN PROVIDING NECESSARY CHARITY CARE
WHEREAS, the Illinois Attorney General has been active in pursuing legal action against those hospitals
in Cook County and elsewhere that have failed to provide a sufficient level of direct provision of medical
services to the uninsured and underinsured members of our community ("Charity Care") in order to
justify the property tax exemptions given to them; and
WHEREAS, the property tax exemptions given to hospitals in Cook County accounted for millions of
dollars in uncollected revenue for the County in Fiscal Year 2006, revenue that could have been used
within Cook County's health system to provide much needed health care to uninsured and underinsured
residents of Cook County; and
WHEREAS, for those hospitals that provide sufficient Charity Care, the property tax exemptions are
deserved, worthwhile, and should continue to be used as appropriate incentive for those hospitals to
provide the Charity Care; and
WHEREAS, Cook County is entitled to receive from each of the hospitals in the County either (a)
property tax dollars or (b) a sufficient amount of Charity Care provided to residents of the County to
justify the property tax exemption; and
WHEREAS, it is the legal responsibility of the Cook County State's Attorney's Office to investigate
whether or not entities are providing the services to the residents of Cook County that they are legally
obligated to provide, and thus it is the responsibility of the Cook County State's Attorney 's Office to
investigate whether or not these hospitals are providing a sufficient level of Charity Care; and
WHEREAS, for those hospitals that have failed to provide sufficient Charity Care, the property tax
exemption should be revoked; and
WHEREAS, the State's Attorney's Office has failed to keep a watchful eye on whether or not Cook
County residents have been repeatedly defrauded by these hospitals that are not providing sufficient levels
of Charity Care.

3133

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 6, 2007

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County State's Attorney 's Office be required
to immediately begin legal proceedings against each hospital in Cook County not currently providing a
sufficient level of Charity Care to warrant a property tax exemption to (a) remove the legal status entitling
a property tax exemption from each such hospital, and (b) impose such sanctions as are necessary and
appropriate upon each such hospital; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County State' s Attorney 's Office be tasked with
regularly monitoring all hospitals in Cook County to ensure on an on-going basis that all hospitals will
either provide property tax dollars to Cook County or sufficient Charity Care to Cook County residents.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 6, 2007
The following is a synopsis of the Proposed Ordinance Amendment:
PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT
AN AMENDMENT TO CHAPTER 2
ARTICLE Vil OF THE COOK COUNTY CODE
WHEREAS, it is crucial that the people of the County of Cook have trust, respect and
confidence in those who are elected to public office; and
WHEREAS, it is equally crucial that the citizenry have absolute faith in the integrity of the
electoral process by which our public officials are chosen; and
WHEREAS, to accomplish this, the County of Cook has adopted certain rules and
regulations including campaign finance laws that establish, among other things, limitations on
the amounts of political contributions that may be made by individuals and entities doing
business with the County, registered lobbyists and other entities that have an interest in
influencing the policies and decisions of County government; and
WHEREAS, these laws limit the amount of money that such individuals and entities may
contribute to candidates for public office to $1,500 during a single candidacy and $3,000
during an election year; and
WHEREAS, it is the intent of the elected officials within the County of Cook to reduce the
ability of entities to brazenly ignore these limitations, thereby restoring faith in the integrity
of the electoral process and the candidates who might otherwise benefit from these abuses;
and
WHEREAS, the County of Cook wishes to strengthen its campaign finance laws to prevent
persons or entities with a financial or other interest in the decisions made by County
government from attempting to manipulate the County's campaign finance laws through
cynically clever and circuitous financing and contribution methods; and
WHEREAS, this ordinance is intended to put an end to this untenable situation, to close any
real or perceived loopholes, and to avoid future abuses of the County's campaign finance
laws by the very people these laws were intended to constrain.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners
that Chapter 2, Article VII, Sections 2-561, 2-585 and 2-601 of the Cook County Code are
hereby amended as follows:
Division 2. Code of Ethical Conduct

Sec. 2-561. Definitions.

THE COOK COUNTY ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND CLIMATE CHANGE
MITIGATION ACT (PROPOSED ORDINANCE). Submitting a Proposed Ordinance
sponsored by Forrest Claypool, and Mike Quigley, County Commissioner~; Cosponsored by Elizabeth "Liz" Doody Gorman, Mike Qt:1igley, Roberto Maldonado,
Anthony J. Peraica and Peter N. Silvestri, County Commissioners.
The following is a synopsis of the Proposed Ordinance.
PROPOSED ORDINANCE

THE COOK COUNTY ENERGY EFFICIENCY
AND CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION ACT
WHEREAS, the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX) provides a means for governments
and firms to enter into a voluntary, legally binding agreement to reduce their emissions of
six greenhouse gasses by 1.2 percent each year from 2006 to 201 O; and
WHEREAS, the CCX operates under a standard "cap-and-trade" system: each emitter is
allocated a certain number of credits and the number of credits is lowered each successive
year, allowing entities that reduce their emissions below their requirements to sell credits
and those that do not meet their requirements to purchase them; and
WHEREAS, many governments including the City of Chicago, King County,
Washington, and the State of Mexico as well as many Fortune 500 companies including
Ford, IBM, and DuPont have joined the CCX and committed themselves to reductions;
and
WHEREAS, Chicago reduced its direct greenhouse gas emissions by nearly nine percent
from its baseline (an average of between 1998 and 2001) and 2003, a reduction of over
30,000 tons of global warming pollution; and
WHEREAS, the City's steps to improve energy efficiency in City buildings led to the
auditing and retrofitting of 15 million square feet of public buildings, allowing the City
and sister agencies to save $6 million annually.

(b)

Joining the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX).
Cook County shall enter into Phase II of the CCX, committing to a
reduction of 1.2 percent of its greenhouse gas emissions each year
between 2006 and 2010.
The County will deliver energy consumption and other relevant data to
the CCX which will assist the County in creating an emissions baseline
from future reductions will be measured.
The County will develop a strategic plan within three months of the
passage of this ordinance that outlines where the County will cut
greenhouse gas emissions by the amounts required-or exceeding the
amounts required-in Phase II of CCX. This plan will be made publicly
available through the President's Web site.
As the emissions reduction plan is implemented, the County will sell any
extra emissions credits that it has on the CCX 's online trading platform.

The Cook County Department of Environmental Control shall establish
procedures for the collection of air pollution filing permit and annual emissions fees.
(b) The Cook County Department of Environmental Control ("Department") may deny
an application for the issuance, transfer, or renewal of an air pollution operating permit if
any air pollution site fee owed by the applicant has not been paid within 60 days of the
due date, unless the applicant, at the time of application, pays to the Department in
advance the air pollution site fee for the site that is the subject of the operating permit,
plus any other air pollution site fees then owed by the applicant. The denial of an air
pollution operating permit for failure to pay an air pollution site fee shall be subject to
review by the County Environmental Control Board of Appeals pursuant to the
provisions of Chapter 30, Article II, Division 4. Section 30-123 of the Counties Code.

the avoided permit fees with or without pursuing enforcement. The avoided permit fees
shall be calculated as double the amount that would have been owed had a permit been
timely obtained. Fees collected pursuant to this subsection shall be deposited into the
Cook County Environmental Management Fund
(d) If the Cook County Department of Environmental Control determines that an owner
or operator of a site was required, but failed, to timely obtain an air pollution operating
permit and as a result avoided the payment of permit fees, an enforcement action may be
brought. In addition to any other relief that may be obtained as part of this action, the
Cook County Department of Environmental Control may seek to recover the avoided
permit fees. The avoided pem1it fees shall be calculated as double the amount that would
have been owed had a permit been timely obtained. Fees collected pursuant to this
subsection (d) shall be deposited into the Cook County General Fund.

the amount of the fee payment, the Department shall notify the Permittee of the failure to
pay the fee. If the Permittee fails to pay the fee within 60 days after such notification, the
Department may, by written notice, immediately revoke the air pollution operating
permit. Failure of the Cook County Department of Environmental Control to notify the
Permittee of failure to pay a fee due under this Section, or the payment of the fee from an
account with insufficient funds to cover the amount of the fee payment, does not excuse
or alter the duty of the Permittee to comply with the provisions of this Section.

County Department of Environmental Control will be verified by reviewing the
Site/Permitee's Illinois Annual Air Emission Report (AER).
(b) Established Regulated Air Pollutant emission reductions exceeding 10% on an annual
basis will allow a 10% credit reduction of the following year annual air permit fee.
(c) Failure to reduce Regulated Air Pollutant emissions as indicated in the County
approved Reduction Plan may result in penalty fees or loss of permit.
Section 30-398. Required Submission of Illinois Annual Air Emission Report.

On behalf of Commissioners Goslin and Suffredin, as a sponsor of Resolution 07-R-240 declaring Cook
County a "Fair and Equal County for Immigrants" that was approved by the Board of Commissioners on
June 5, 2007, I am hereby requesting to delete the word " agent" from the text of the resolution and
contained in the following clauses:

WHEREAS, by means of this Resolution, Cook County joins states, cities, and counties
across the nation by declaring itself a "Fair and Equal County for Immigrants", which
means that Cook County ensures fair and equal access to essential benefits, opportunities,
and services by prohibiting Cook County bureaus, offices, departments, or employees or
other Cook County agencies or agents from inquiring or disclosing information about
immigration status.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that except as provided below or when
otherwise required by law, no Cook County bureau, office, department, employee, or
other Cook County agency or agent shall condition the provision of Cook County
benefits, opportunities, or services on matters related to citizenship or immigrant status;
and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that except when otherwise required by law, no Cook
County bureau, office, department, or employee or other Cook County agency or agent
shall disclose information regarding the citizenship or immigrant status of any person
unless required to do so by law or such disclosure has been authorized in writing by the
individual to whom such information pertains, or if such individual is a minor or is
otherwise not legally competent, by such individual's parent or guardian; and

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 6, 2007

ru les, union contracts, civil service commission rules, or any other agency rules and/or

to the Cook County Office of the Inspector General ("Inspector General") who shall

RESOLUTION DECLARING COOK COUNTY A
"FAIR AND EQUAL COUNTY FOR IMMIGRANTS"
WHEREAS, the County of Cook is a home rule unit of local government pursuant to Article VII, Section
6(a) of the 1970 Illinois Constitution; and
WHEREAS, pursuant to its home rule power, the County of Cook may exercise any power and perform
any function relating to its government and affairs including the power to regulate for the protection of
the public health, safety, morals, and welfare; and
WHEREAS, to this end, the County of Cook is dedicated to providing all of its residents with fair and
equal access to the services, opportunities, and protection county government has been established to
admin ister; and
WHEREAS, there are now approximately 12 mi llion undocumented immigrants in the United States,
including half a million in Illinois and more than 300,000 who live in communities throughout Cook
County, working full-time jobs, paying taxes, and contributing to Social Security and Medicare; and
WHEREAS, conditioning the provision of benefits, opportunities, and services on citizenship or
immigrant status or inquiring about such status in the course of such provision directly contravenes the
County's commitment to ensuring fair and equal access for all of its res idents; and
WHEREAS, the enforcement of civil immigration laws has historically been a federal government
responsibility, a power vested first in the Immigration and Naturalization Service and then in the
Department of Homeland Security; and

3324

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 6; 2007

WHEREAS, initiatives such as the proposed Federal Clear Law Enforcement for Criminal Alien
Removal Act, which would require local governments to give their local law enforcement agencies
express authority to enforce immigration laws, also signals pressure to expend limited local resources on
traditionally federal functions; and
WHEREAS, encouraging local governments that are not specifically equipped or trained to implement
immigration measures is likely to result in inconsistencies and decentralization that undermine instead of
strengthen these measures; and
WHEREAS, as a matter of public safety, the protection of an individual' s citizenship and immigrant
status will engender trust and cooperation between law enforcement officials and immigrant communities
to aid in crime prevention and solving, including human and drug trafficking, prostitution, domestic
violence, and even terrorism, and will discourage the threat of immigrant and racial profiling and
harassment; and
WHEREAS, according to the National Immigration Law Center, nearly 50 cities and counties throughout
the U.S. have enacted "Sanctuary Laws", prohibiting their agencies from inquiring about immigration
status and unilaterally enforcing immigration law provisions including Cambridge, Chicago, Los Angeles,
and Seattle and several states, including Alaska, Maine and Oregon; and
WHEREAS, by means of this Resolution, Cook County joins states, cities, and counties across the nation
by declaring itself a "Fair and Equal County for Immigrants", which means that Cook County ensures fair
and equal access to essential benefits, opportunities, and services by prohibiting Cook County bureaus,
offices, departments, or employees or other Cook County agencies or age0ts from inquiring or disclosing
information about immigration status.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that except as provided below or when otherwise required
by law, no Cook County bureau, office, department, employee, or other Cook County agency or ageAt
shall condition the provision of Cook County benefits, opportunities, or services on matters related to
citizenship or immigrant status; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that it shall be the policy of the Cook County Sheriffs Office not to
assist in the investigation of the citizenship or immigrant status of any person unless such inquiry or
investigation is (a) integrally related to an investigation by the Cook County Sheriffs Office regarding a
matter other than the individual 's citizenship or immigrant status, such as criminal smuggling and
harboring of immigrants, or other crimes that have as an element of the crime the illegality of a person 's
presence, or (b) as otherwise required by law. The Cook County Sheriffs Office shall not make inquiries
into immigration status for the sole purpose of determining whether an individual has violated the civil
immigration laws; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that except when otherwise required by law, no Cook County bureau,
office, department, or employee or other Cook County agency or ageAt shall disclose information
regarding the citizenship or immigrant status of any person unless required to do so by law or such
disclosure has been authorized in writing by the individual to whom such information pertains, or if such
individual is a minor or is otherwise not legally competent, by such individual 's parent or guardian; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Bureau of Health Services ("CCBH") shall not
condition the provision of health benefits, opportunities, or services on matters related to citizenship or
immigrant status, but may, in the course of determining eligibility for benefits or seeking reimbursement
from state, federal, or other third party payers, inquire about immigrant status for the sole purpose of such
a determination or receipt of reimbursement from said sources and, to such extent as the disclosure of
such information is related to such a determination or receipt of reimbursement, the provisions of this
Resolution and any subsequent ordinance do not apply to the CCBH; and

3325

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 6, 2007

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that except when otherwise required by law, where presentation of an
Illinois driver's license or identification card is accepted as adequate evidence of identity, presentation of
a photo identity document issued by the person's nation of origin, such as a driver's license, passport, or
matricula consular (consulate-issued document) shall be accepted and shall not subject the person to a
higher level of scrutiny or different treatment than if the person had provided an Illinois driver's license
or identification card except that this provision does not apply to the completion of the federally mandated
1-9 forms provided, however, that a request for translation of such document to English shall not be
deemed a violation of any provi sion of this Resolution and any subsequent ordinance; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that this Resolution does not create or form the basis for liability on
the part of the County, its agents, or agencies. The exclusive remedy for violation of this Resolution shall
be through the County 's disciplinary procedures for officers and employees under regulations including,
but not limited to, County personnel rules, union contracts, civil service commission rules, or any other
agency rules and/or regulations. Any person alleging a violation of this Resolution shall forward a
complaint to the Cook County Office of the Inspector General ("Inspector Genera l") who shall process it
in accordance with the complaint-processing procedures established in the Cook County Code (Vol. I, Ch.
2, Art. IV, Div. 5, Sec. 2-285); and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that any applications, questionnaires and interview fonn s used in
relation to Cook County benefits, opportunities or services shall be promptly reviewed by the pertinent
agencies, and any questions requiring disclosure of information related to citizenship or immigrant status,
other than those (a) permitted by this Resolution to require the disclosure of such information or (b)
otherwise required by law, shall be, in the best judgment of the pertinent agency, either deleted in its
entirety or revised such that the disclosure is no longer required. Such review and revision shall be

IN SUPPORT OF THE UNITED STATES CONGRESSIONAL MORATORIUM
ON PROPOSED MEDICAID RULES
WHEREAS, the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and Centers for

Proposed Medicaid Rules; and
WHEREAS, with the active support of the Illinois Congressional Delegation, the Durbin Amendment
was included in Public Law 110-28 " U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Health, and Iraq Accountability
Act, 2007" and signed into law by President Bush; and
WHEREAS, the one-year moratorium expires on May 25, 2008, one year from the date of enactment,
and HHS has indicated that it plans to implement the Proposed Medicaid Rules at that point; and
