1. Approval of Minutes
The Finance & Operations Committee minutes from June 19, 2019 were approved as written.
2. Finance Reports – June 2019
Felicia Harrison, Chief Financial Officer, reported that for the first 6 months of 2019 the Board has spent a total of
$2,344,122.00 that is roughly 41.26% of the total Administrative budget. There are a few line items over the 50% mark;
however, the overall categories are not over 50%. Ms. Harrison noted that efforts to reallocate line items within each
category may be done in the future.
In June, the Board received revenues of $1,617,380.00, bringing our total revenue to $50,904,138.00 which is
approximately 80% of our anticipated revenue for the year as a result of receiving our total County allocation in January
2019. Expenditures for June were $5,858,492.00 bringing our total expenses for the first 6 months to $26,928,415.00 that is
42% of our anticipated expenditures for the calendar year. (The Financial Reports are attached to the original minutes in the
Executive Unit.)
Motion to recommend approval of the Board Voucher and Expenditure Reports for June 2019 to the full Board.
MOTION: H. Snider / SECOND: B. Gohlstin / AYES: R. Fowler, B. Gohlstin, S. Killpack, E. Kirkland, S. Rosenbaum,
H. Snider / NAYS: None / Motion passed.
3. State Budget Update
Scott Osiecki, C.E.O., shared information about the approved State Budget and its impact on behavioral health. The budget
allows for allocating $1.5 million statewide for continuing crisis stabilization services for the Collaboratives and for allocating
to ADAMHS Boards statewide: $84 million in SFY2020 (State Fiscal Year) and $82 million in SFY 2021.
The results of a state audit determined that the Ohio Department of Mental Health & Addiction Services (OhioMHAS) should
develop an equitable formula for its allocations to ADAMHS Boards. OhioMHAS Director Lori Criss indicated that she does
not know yet what type of distribution formula will be used. A workgroup comprised of community stakeholders will be
established to help develop the formula. The Ohio Association of County Behavioral Health Authorities (OACBHA) will be
represented on the workgroup and Mr. Osiecki has asked that he and Ms. Harrison be included as representatives of a
large ADAMHS Board. Director Criss stated that the process may take some time; consequently, she is not anticipating any
changes in the allocations for SFY2020 or SFY2021.
Mr. Osiecki highlighted various other budget items and also noted that the State Budget included several allocations
earmarked for specific provider agencies. OACBHA is strongly opposed to any earmarks in the State Budget that did not go
through their respective ADAMHS Board. Discussion followed on the impact of these decisions on our Board’s next budget
cycle. Overall, the State Budget should be good for our Board; there were no cuts or reductions in funding.

Mr. Killpack recommended including the June 2019 Finance Reports, Contracts and Contract Amendments into the Consent
Agenda to be recommended for approval to the full Board.
8. Old/New Business
▪ GOSH Update – Curtis Couch, Chief Technology & Data Analytics Officer, provided a comprehensive update on the
progress made to date with the Board’s GOSH System. Three handouts were distributed to illustrate the information
shared:
- Providers’ GOSH Status, as of 7/24/19; page 2 identifies those providers with no testing activities.
- Alphabetic listing of Providers’ GOSH Status – 1st half of 2019 / 2nd half of 2019
- 90-day Billing Requirement per Contract
▪ CY20 ADAMHS Board Funding Request – Mr. Osiecki distributed a document that explains the data to be collected
for the first 6 months of 2019 from agencies for only those programs funded by the ADAMHS Board. The data will be
used to determine the services it plans on purchasing from its current providers for FY2020. Mr. Osiecki highlighted the
data to be requested of providers and noted that submission of the CY20 Funding Request form is not a guarantee of a
contract. He added that the ADAMHS Board is not accepting applications for new providers or services at this time.
Upon review of the document, Dr. Fowler suggested that the Program Metrics statement be reworded to read
“programs funded by ADAMHS Board dollars”. The CY20 ADAMHS Board Funding Request will be sent out to provider
agencies in August, and providers will be given 25-30 days to submit the information requested. This proposed timeline
will allow Board staff time to review, determine and present the budget information during the October and November
Board meeting cycles. Mr. Osiecki reported that this process and information request will be shared at the All Provider
Meeting on Tuesday, July 30th.
▪ SHARES Status Update – Mr. Snider inquired about the status of the latest SHARES request. Mr. Osiecki reported
that after the ADAMHS Board of Cuyahoga County sent its letter to the COG (Council of Governments) stating that we
were not responsible for the additional $68,000.00 requested to pay for SHARES changes needed as a result of our
leaving SHARES, no additional contact has been made.
There being no further business, the meeting adjourned at 5:40 p.m.
