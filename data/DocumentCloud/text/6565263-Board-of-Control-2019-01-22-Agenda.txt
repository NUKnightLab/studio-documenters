Greg Huth, Department of Development, presented. Dale Miller asked when did the County make the
commitment to provide funding to support this event; commented that he did attend the event and feels
this was a good investment to put the County on the map in terms of this area of activity with attendance
of vendors worldwide. Nan Baker concurred with Mr. Miller’s comments; asked how staff workloads
impacted the timing of this submission for approval, as indicated in the response to Council’s advanced
questions, and how this has not been a factor in other types of similar requests. Lenora Lockett stated
that the overall heavy workload on the Office of Procurement and Diversity staff during this time, partially
contributed to the delay of this request as items are processed on a “first in – first out” basis and provided
a timeline of the approval dates of all reviewers of this item. Ms. Lockett said that she can only speak to
the delays in the Office of Procurement and Diversity and cannot comment on any delays from other
reviewers. Ms. Baker asked that future requests be submitted in advance of the events so that the Board
is not asked to approve funding after services were provided. Ms. Lockett agreed with Ms. Baker’s
comment and stated that this should not be an issue with the new Enterprise Resource Planning System,
which will provide staggered alerts to the approvers of items needing attention, which the current system
does not have. Dennis Kennedy motioned to approve the item; Michael Dever seconded. Item BC201928 was unanimously approved.

Court Project for the period 9/30/2018 - 9/29/2023.
Funding Source: Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Grant
Martin Murphy, Corrections Planning Board, presented. Dale Miller asked the reason for late submittal
and asked if the requested award amount is for fiscal and administrative services or for direct services;
recommended that the language of the service description used on the agenda is clear so that the public
is aware that the actual treatment services are being funded and not the administrative costs. Dennis
Kennedy asked how the service description in the contract is written. Andria Richardson, Clerk of the
Board of Control, stated that the contract reads that services are for fiscal agent and administration
services, as presented on the written agenda. Trevor McAleer asked how much of the awarded amount is

Funding Source: General Fund
Donna Kaleal, Sheriff’s Department, presented. Trevor McAleer asked how many hours or nurses will be
made available each week or month for the $300,000.00 being requested and is there a limit per day of
nurses being provided on days when the jails are understaffed; asked what the ratio of Registered Nurses
to Licensed Practical Nurses is. Dale Miller asked if this is a transitional arrangement until an agreement
is reached with MetroHealth to begin providing nursing services to the jails and asked if these funds have
been budgeted and require the use of the General Fund reserve; and recommended forecasting the future
costs now, to incorporate into the 2019 budget, as budget amendments will be considered by Council
soon. Nan Baker asked if cooperation and communication is good between the Sheriff’s Department and
MetroHealth, and that a plan and understanding of the transition timing, staffing and financial needs are

known John Lawson for years and served on the City of Cleveland Council with him; however, the
relationship does not rise to the level of recusal for this item but wanted to make a statement for the
public record. Trevor McAleer asked if $10,000.00 will be enough to carry through to the end of the year
as expenses in the amount of $3,000.00 - $4,000.00 have already been incurred and asked when and
under what circumstances led to utilizing this vendor for services, as there are other firms who may be
able to provide legal services. Dennis Kennedy motioned to approve the item; Michael Dever seconded.

Dale Miller referred to Item No. BC2019-52, Proposed Purchases, Requisition Nos. SH-19-44352 and

Req. #SH-19-44354 2019 Alternative Procurement Request to Purchase a Specific Brand Name
of Bulletproof Vests for Deputies
Sheriff’s Department requesting approval for an alternative procurement process to be able to specify a
brand name of bulletproof vest. A formal competitive bid process will still be used for the vest, but for
the specific brand. The anticipated Requisition # is SH-19-44354 for a Purchase Order not-to-exceed
$100,000.00.
The Project is not new to the County, however, in the past we have purchased only a few at a time as
new vests or replacements were required. This formal process will allow us to use only one competitive
process for the year and negotiate a lower price based upon quantity.
The anticipated start date is the date the item is approved by the BOC and the completion date will be
12/31/2019.
The primary goal of the project is to procure bulletproof vest for deputies that have the highest safety
rating at an economical cost.
The project is mandated by union contracts. The union contracts require that the vests are replace
every 5 years per industry recommended guidelines.
Procurement
The procurement method for this project will be RFB, but with a brand of vest specified. The total value
of the RFB is not to exceed $100,000.00. This amount should cover required replacements and new
hires.
An RFB Exemption is being requested for a brand specific item. The reason we are requesting the
specific brand is that it was tested last year by current law enforcement staff and found to have the
highest safety rating, while having the lowest cost.
Contractor and Project Information
No vendor has been selected.
Project Status and Planning
The project reoccurs annually.
Funding
The project is funded 100% by the General Fund.
