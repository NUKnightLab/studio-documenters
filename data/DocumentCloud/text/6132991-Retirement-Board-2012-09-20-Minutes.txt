 MEABF Fraud Reporting Policy
The purpose of this policy is to establish a Municipal Employees’ and Officers’ Annuity
and Benefit Fund of Chicago (MEABF) framework for the reporting of any reasonable
suspicion of a false statement or falsified record being submitted to, or permitted by a
person associated with, MEABF consistent with 40 ILCS 5/1-114 and 40 ILCS 5/1-135
of the Illinois Pension Code.
The goals of this policy are to:
• make members and third parties that interact with MEABF aware of the
requirement that all written submissions to MEABF must be accurate and
complete, and of the potential consequences of a failure to meet this
requirement; and
• make employees aware of their obligations under Section 1-135 to immediately
report any reasonable suspicion of a false statement or falsified record being
submitted to MEABF.

Policy
It is the policy of MEABF that all employees must report any “reasonable suspicion” of a
false statement or falsified record being submitted to MEABF, or being permitted by any
person associated with MEABF.
If any employee has a “reasonable suspicion” that he or she has been presented with a
false statement or a falsified record, or has knowledge that another person associated
with MEABF has permitted MEABF to accept a false statement or falsified record, that
employee shall immediately report his or her reasonable suspicions, in writing, to the
Executive Director or his designee.
The Executive Director shall investigate, or cause to be investigated, all reports of false
statements or falsified records and, if the Executive Director concludes that specific and
articulable facts, taken together with reasonable inferences from those facts, would lead
a reasonable person to believe that a fraud has been or will be committed, the
Executive Director shall immediately report the matter, in writing, to the Board of
Trustees.
If the Board of Trustees, or any member of the Board, concludes that a reasonable
suspicion exists to believe that the reported matter may involve fraudulent activity, the
Board or the Board member, as applicable, shall report the matter, or cause the
Executive Director to report the matter, to the State’s Attorney of the jurisdiction where
the alleged fraudulent activity occurred for investigation. The Board Chair shall be
notified of any report made to the State’s Attorney office.

47

 MEABF employees shall cooperate with the State’s Attorney in any investigation of any
reported instance of alleged fraudulent activity pursuant to this Policy.
Failure of an employee to comply with this Policy shall be grounds for discipline.
Definitions
"reasonable suspicion” shall mean a belief, based upon specific and articulable facts,
taken together with rational inferences from those facts that would lead a reasonable
person to believe that fraud has been, or will be, committed. A reasonable suspicion is
more than a non-particularized suspicion. A mere inconsistency standing alone, does
not give rise to a reasonable suspicion.

Adopted: September 20, 2012
