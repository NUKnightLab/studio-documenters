Board and Committee Reports (continued)
E. Finance Committee Meeting, July 19, 2019
i. Metrics (Attachment #3) and FY2020 Budget Overview (Attachment #4)
ii. Meeting Minutes, which include the following action items and report:
• Contracts and Procurement Items (detail was provided as an attachment to this Agenda)
This was considered concurrently with Item VII(A). Action took place on Item V(E) following the adjournment of
the closed meeting.
Director Reiter presented the Meeting Minutes for the Board’s consideration. Ekerete Akpan, Chief Financial
Officer, reviewed the Metrics and Budget Overview, and Charles Jones, Chief Procurement Officer, provided a brief
overview of the contractual requests considered at the Finance Committee Meeting. It was noted that there are seven
(7) requests pending review by Contract Compliance (request numbers 12, 14, 16, 17 and 18, within the Finance
Committee Meeting Minutes, and request numbers 1 and 2 under Board Agenda Item VII(A)).
With regard to request number 1 under the Contracts and Procurement Items contained within the Minutes, pertaining
to a grant for the Nurse Practitioner Residency IMPRESSIVE Program, Director Driscoll stated that this grant will
be very important for nursing; she would like to receive reports on the rollout and implementation of the program.
The Board discussed the subject of the process used by the Cook County Office of Contract Compliance in granting
full or partial minority and women-owned business enterprise (M/WBE)nparticipation waivers to vendors.
Sometimes, under certain circumstances, and usually due to the particular scope of the contract or service, vendors
are unable to meet the goals of M/WBE participation. Once all efforts have been exhausted to find ways for them
to directly or indirectly meet the goals, a waiver committee within Contract Compliance is convened to determine
whether a waiver should be granted. If a waiver is granted, the contract can move forward for execution. Director
Reiter requested that a broader discussion on the waiver process be held at the next Finance Committee Meeting.
During the discussion of the Income Statement within the Finance Metrics, Mr. Akpan noted that line 4 (CountyCare
Access Payments) was recently added, which is why there is no budgeted number associated with it; this will change
with the next fiscal year. Director Reiter noted that, when the extra category for CountyCare Access Payments was
added, that number was already included within one or more categories, and there was probably a percentage of
budget assigned to that number within those categories. He inquired whether Mr. Akpan can calculate a budget
number to plug in there, based on what was included as budget numbers in its previous categories, and include
footnotes to explain. Mr. Akpan responded affirmatively.
During the discussion of the critical success factors listed in the Budget Overview (slide 7 of the presentation), Vice
Chair Richardson-Lowry inquired regarding the factor of “successful implementation of new Cerner patient
accounting system and revenue cycle improvements.” She asked whether progress reports will be provided to the
Board on that subject. Mr. Akpan responded affirmatively; he indicated that they may be presented on a quarterly
basis, and will be considered a priority for the Audit and Compliance Committee.
Vice Chair Richardson-Lowry, seconded by Director Thomas, moved the approval of the
Minutes of the Meeting of the Finance Committee of July 19, 2019. THE MOTION
CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

Approval of CCH Strategic Plan 2020-2022: Impact 2023 (Attachment #9)

Dr. Shannon provided an introduction to the item. He stated that he and staff have taken the feedback received
from Directors at the June Board Meeting and Special Board Meeting in July and have incorporated that into the
strategic plan document presented to the Board today for consideration. He noted that Mr. Akpan will be
presenting the three (3) year financial forecast relating to Impact 2023 next month; it is expected to be presented
at the same time the proposed FY2020 Preliminary Budget is presented.
Vice Chair Richardson-Lowry, seconded by Director Koetting, moved the approval of the
CCH Strategic Plan 2020-2022: Impact 2023.

Page 4 of 179

 VII. Action Items
B.

Approval of CCH Strategic Plan 2020-2022: Impact 2023 (continued)

Vice Chair Richardson-Lowry inquired whether Impact 2020 overdue or unfinished items will carry forward to
this plan, specifically the “adopt nursing professional practice model” and “implement physician practice plan.”
Dr. Shannon responded that the item regarding the physician practice plan is not included as a carryover item;
however, unfinished items can be carried forward by modifying the motion to approve Impact 2023.
Director Suleiman Gonzales stated that, in her opinion, in reading the overall plan, she feels that social
determinants of health is almost overshadowing the role of culture and cultural competence; she believes that
cultural competency is much more muted in Impact 2023. She would like to see that more elevated.
Additionally, in Impact 2020, a list of principles and values was included, which helped to frame the strategies
in a more contextualized way. She recommended that those be included in Impact 2023.
Vice Chair Richardson-Lowry modified her motion to the following: motion to approve the
CCH Strategic Plan 2020-2022: Impact 2023, with the acceptance that unfinished business
from Impact 2020 will be carried forward in Impact 2023. THE MOTION CARRIED
UNANIMOUSLY.

Quarterly report from CCDPH (continued)

Vice Chair Richardson-Lowry noted that, when looking at the geographic/scope of coverage, the staffing numbers
do not work. She asked Ms. Brooks to work with Dr. Mason to determine what that delta would be in an ideal world.
She stated that, because of the particular nature of this population, it is worth exploring other avenues of resources
to make sure the program has greater access to what is needed in terms of staffing.
IX.

Report from Chair of the Board
Chair Hammock commented on the recent report released by the Cook County Office of the Independent Inspector
General (OIIG) regarding CountyCare. He stated that the Board has retained Deloitte US to help Cook County
Health analyze the facts around the OIIG report. Management has some disagreement with the OIIG’s
interpretation and conclusions as to the System’s financial affairs; therefore, he felt that, as a Board, this body
wants to be sure it is getting the best and most accurate interpretation possible. He personally contacted three (3)
outside firms capable of performing this work. He noted that Cook County’s own external auditor, RSM, was
conflicted because they do the audit of the County and CCH’s annual financial statements, so they could not
perform this additional work. Two (2) firms chose to make formal presentations that were thorough in terms of
understanding the timing and scope of the work to be done. Timing is an important aspect, as management intends
to respond before the end of August, so they have asked Deloitte to have their report done by August 15th. The
OIIG granted an extension of time for CCH’s response to the report, to allow for additional time to examine the
matter.

JOHN JAY SHANNON, MD

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER

COOK COUNTY HEALTH

REPORT TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
JULY 26, 2019

Employee Recognition

Chiquita Hudson, a registered nurse in our medical intensive care unit, was recently recognized for her extraordinary
patient care with the DAISY award. The DAISY award is an international program that rewards and celebrates the
extraordinary compassionate and skillful care given by nurses every day. A patient who had an excellent patient
experience at Cook County Health nominated Chiquita. The patient felt like family and stated the only pain about the

experience was saying goodbye.

Activities and Announcements

On July 16, Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle and Cook County Health (CCH) broke ground on a
new $12 million state-of?the-art health center in Chicago?s Belmont?Cragin neighborhood located at 5501 West
Fullerton Avenue. The new health center will replace Logan Square Health Center at 2840 West Fullerton
once construction is complete in 2020, tripling the size to a footprint. With 30 exam rooms,
the Hanson Park Health Center will expand high quality, integrated health care to thousands of Cook County
residents. Expanded pediatric and adult primary care services, women?s health, dental care, as well as specialty
services like cardiology and endocrinology will be provided. The Women, Infants and Children (WIC) food
assistance program will also be on?site. By improving access to care and focusing on community wellness, CCH
can ultimately improve the health of all Cook Health patients, reduce unnecessary health care costs, and
decrease emergency room visits and inpatient stays. CCH officials estimate that the site will accommodate more

than 50,000 visits annuaily.

IMPACT 2020 Objectives 1.2, 2.1

Several members of the CCH care coordination and teams conducted in a study that has been
recently published by Services. The report, improving the Evaluation of Adult Mental Disorders in the
Criminal Justice System with Computerized Adoptive Testing, sought to develop a mental health screening and
assessment tool for use in the justice-involved population. The study identified modifications that can be made
to a previously-validated tool ?to measure the severity of depression, anxiety, mania and/or hypomania,
suicidality and substance use disorder in an English- and Spanish- speaking criminal justice population.? The

study is attached.

IMPACT 2020 Objectives 1.2, 1.6, 7.1

Food As Medicine Update

Through July 1, Fresh Truck partnership with the Greater Chicago Food Depository (GCFD) has resulted in
195 visits to 13 CCH health centers Arlington Heights, Austin, Cicero, the CORE Center, Cottage Grove,
Englewood, Logan Square, Near South, Oak Forest, Provident/Sengstacke, Prieto, Robbins, and Woodlawn.

Collectively, the Fresh Truck distributions have resulted in the provision of fresh fruits and vegetables to 25,558
individuals, representing 84,611 household members, totaling more than 525,000 pounds of fresh produce.
Most of the individuals benefiting from the Fresh Truck screened positive for food insecurity at a CCH health
center visit.

CCH Fresh Markets are offered in the south suburbs. Fresh produce is supplied by Black Oaks Center, a nonprofit
that seeks to create a just, holistic, and local food system through education, entrepreneurship, and access to
healthy, affordable foods. CCH partners with Experimental Station?s Link Up Illinois Link Match program to offer
SNAP users with a match on all purchases at CCH Fresh Markets, up to SZO/market/week. CCH Fresh Markets?
schedule is listed below:

0 Oak Forest Health Center on Wednesdays, 9am?2pm

0 Robbins Health Center on Thursdays, 11am-3pm

Legislative Updates

Local

State

On June 27, 2019 Cook County Commissioner Donna Miller introduced a resolution calling on Cook County
Health leadership to appear before the Board's Health and Hospitals Committee to respond to Commissioner
questions related to the Office of the Independent Inspector General (OIIG) report on CountyCare Finances. The
committee meeting was held on June 25, 2019.

The Illinois General Assembly is scheduled to return to Springfield October 28-30 and November 12-14 for the
Fall Veto Session. The schedule for the 2020 Spring Session has yet to be announced, but will likely start in mid-
January 2020 and run through May 31.

The Governor has not taken action on 531321, also referred to as the Medicaid Omnibus Bill, which passed the
House and Senate unanimously.

531321 intends to address challenges with the state?s eligibility system and resulting delays in processing
Medicaid applications and redeterminations. The bill also seeks to improve the relationship between providers
and Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs) by requiring HFS to establish a claims dispute resolution
process, establishing policies and timelines for MCOs to update provider rosters, and ensuring stakeholder
engagement in efforts to improve MCO operations and further develop value?based payment models. The bill
goes into effect upon becoming law.

531321 was sent to the Governor on June 6. He has 60 days to take action; if no action is taken, the bill
automatically becomes law on day 61.

On July 15, 2019, the Governor signed 581739 into law. SBl739/Public Act 101-0083 went into effect the day it
was signed and makes changes to the Certificate of Need (CON) process overseen by the Illinois Health Facilities
and Services Review Board As a result, facilities that wish to close must pursue a CON and are no
longer allowed to seek an exemption. PA 101-0083 also allows the to defer action on an application to
close a facility if there is pending litigation that names the Board as a party or alleges fraud and sets forth
requirements for notifying the public and elected officials about proposed closures.

On July 22, 2019 Governor Pritzker announced 3 new appointees to the Health Facilities and Services Review
Board. Below are the appointee biographies from the Governor?s announcement.

Sandra Martell will serve on the Health Facilities and Services Review Board.* Dr. Martell has been the Public
Health Administrator for Winnebago County Health Department for the past four years. Her current work in
Winnebago County has been focused on addressing the health priorities of Maternal and Child Health,

her career focused on public health. She worked for the Cook County Department of Public Health in Illinois for
over 25 years progressing from the position of public health nurse to interim Chief Operating Officer. She has
served as adjunct faculty at both the Loyola University and the University of Illinois. Dr. Martell has been the
recipient of the March of Dimes Perinatal Nurse Recognition Award and the Cook County Distinguished Service

0 After returning from the July 4 recess, the House plans three weeks of intense work before leaving town on July
26 for the August recess. The Senate plans to work a week longer, leaving on August 2. Large issues remain
unresolved including agreement on a budget deal and the increasingly urgent need to lift the debt ceiling. And
the conventional wisdom that serious legislating gets more difficult as we near the 2020 elections adds pressure
to lawmakers to get things done before going home to face voters in August.

Medicaid DSH Cuts

- On July 11, the House Energy and Commerce Committee Subcommittee on Health marked up 26 bills, including
a ?health care extenders? package, HR. 2328, which would extend expiring programs or funding. Representative
Joe Kennedy (D?Mass.) offered an amendment which would repeal the reductions to Medicaid disproportionate
share hospital (DSH) payments imposed by the ACA for FY 2020 and FY 2021 and reduce the FY 2022 cut to $4
billion. It is worth noting that the cuts for FY 2020 and FY 2021 would not simply be delayed, or pushed into the
out years, but rather repealed or ?bought out,? though an offset that has not yet been specified.

in addition to delaying the DSH cuts, the amendment included provisions designed to satisfy the objections
raised by Republican members against HR 3022, the full repeal bill offered by Rep. Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.) at the
June subcommittee hearing. The first provision would require CMS to begin making states? Upper Payment Limit
(UPL) hospital demonstrations data public, beginning with state FY 2022.

The second provision would require the Comptroller General of the US. to report to Congress, within 21 months

of enactment, on potential legislation to establish an equitable formula for determining DSH allotments for

States. The report must consider the states? (1) level of hospital uncompensated care costs; (2) expenditures for
4 a 

Page 64 of 179

hospitals, including UPL supplemental payments, and other related payments; and (3) policy decisions that may
affect the level of uncompensated care costs ACA Medicaid expansion). The committee?s Republican
leaders spoke in favor of the amendment and it, and the underlying bill, was agreed to by voice vote.

On July 17, the full Energy and Commerce Committee marked up 26 bipartisan bills, including HR. 2328.
Committee leadership proposed an amendment in the nature of a substitute which included provisions to
address surprise billing and the Medicaid shortfall in the territories. At the end of the markup, the committee
reported the amended HR. 2328 out favorably to the full House by voice vote, indicating broad bipartisan
consensus. It is not yet clear whether the extenders package will get floor time before the August recess.

Senate staff have indicated that the upper chamber is waiting for the House to act. Cook County?s Senate
delegation supports a DSH cut delay and Democratic leadership have said that it is a priority. The shape of the
policy will likely depend on what approach Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-lowa)
decides to do in negotiation with Ranking Member Ron Wyden Grassley has said on the record that he
supports a delay but wants to see legislative reforms to the statutory formula used to determine state DSH
allotments. It remains to be seen if the Government Accounting Office (GAO) report in the House measure will
satisfy Grassley on that score. In addition to timing, questions on a legislative vehicle and offsets remain

outstanding.
Budget and Appropriations

I Talks between the Administration and congressional leaders in search of an agreement to lift the statutory
budget caps under the Budget Control Act of 2011 resumed after the July 4 recess and in the week ofJuly 15
leaders of both parties sounded hopeful that an agreement on the spending caps and debt limit could be
reached. If negotiations fail, automatic ten percent across the board cuts, called sequestration, would be

imposed next year.

a The House passed a second five bill ?minibus? on June 25 so that by the July 4 recess only two regular
appropriations bills remained awaiting floor consideration the controversial Department of Homeland Security
bill and the Legislative Branch bill, sidelined over a proposed congressional pay raise.

0 Meanwhile, Senate appropriators have still not introduced any of their annual spending bills, waiting for a
budget deal to begin marking up bills. This means that at least a short-term continuing resolution (CR) is likely
before the end of the fiscal year September 30, to allow the committee to mark up bills and take them to the

?oon

Health Care Costs

0 On June 26, the Senate Health Education Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee marked up 5.1895, the Lower
Health Care Costs Act of 2019. The bill contains provisions designed to address surprise billing, reduce
prescription drug prices, promote transparency, improve public health and improve the exchange of health
information. The committee reported the bill out favorably to the full Senate, on a 20?3 vote, with Senators
Elizabeth Warren, Rand Paul and Bernie Sanders voting no. Senate leaders tried to send the bill to the floor
under unanimous consent but a number of Republican senators have placed anonymous holds on the bill,
according to press reports. Chairman Alexander is reported to be working with his colleagues to clear the holds.

I The Senate Finance Committee has not yet rolled out a health care cost reduction package for programs in its
jurisdiction, including Medicare and Medicaid.

Protection of Medicaid remains a key priority for at both the State and Federal level.

 ABOUT
About Cook County Health
Cook County Health (CCH or System) is one of the largest

public health systems in the United States, providing a range of
health services regardless of a patient’s ability to pay. Through
the health system and the health plan, CCH serves more than
500,000 unique individuals annually. The System operates:
•

John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County, a
450- bed tertiary, acute care hospital in the Illinois
Medical District;

•

Provident Hospital of Cook County, 79-bed
community acute care hospital on the South Side
of Chicago;

•

More than a dozen community health centers,
which offer primary and specialty care, along with
diagnostic services;

•

The Ruth M. Rothstein CORE Center, a
comprehensive care center for patients with HIV and
other infectious diseases. The CORE Center is the
largest provider of HIV care in the Midwest and one
of the largest in the nation;

•

Cook County Department of Public Health, a state
and nationally certified public health department
serving suburban Cook County;

•

Correctional Health Services, which provides health
care services to the detainees at the Cook County Jail
and residents of the Juvenile Temporary Detention
Center; and

•

CountyCare, the largest Medicaid managed care plan
in Cook County.

The Cook County Department of Public Health (CCDPH) serves
2.5 million residents in 124 municipalities and serves the public
health needs of its jurisdiction through effective and efficient
disease prevention and health promotion programs. CCDPH’s
approach to protecting and promoting health brings residents,
partners and resources together to address issues facing the
communities it serves. The department is responsible for the
prevention of the spread of nearly 70 reportable communicable
diseases and the enforcement of Cook County and Illinois
public health laws, rules and regulations.
In fall 2012, leveraging the Affordable Care Act (ACA), CCH
launched CountyCare as a demonstration project through a
U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) 1115
Waiver granted to the state of Illinois to early-enroll newly
eligible low-income Cook County adults into a Medicaid
managed care program. Many of CountyCare’s 300,000+
members are long-standing CCH patients who previously
received care.
CountyCare is operated by CCH. Through CCH, CountyCare
receives a capitated per-member per-month payment and
pays for services rendered to members within the network.
CountyCare’s provider network includes all CCH facilities,
every Federally Qualified Health Center in Cook County,
community mental health centers and drug treatment centers,
4,000 primary care providers, 16,000 specialists and more than
50 hospitals.
CountyCare also covers approved home- and communitybased services, vision and dental services, and allows members
to fill prescriptions at local pharmacies or use CCH pharmacy
services, including a mail-order system.

The System’s hospitals and ambulatory network, including
its Primary Care Medical Home model, are Joint Commission
accredited. Stroger Hospital also holds certifications in stroke,
burn, perinatal and oncology care.

IMPACT 2023
Strategic Plan

 LETTER FRO
Letter from the CEO

In 2016, Cook County Health (CCH) embarked on a threeyear strategic plan amidst the most dramatic changes the
health care industry had seen in decades. The Affordable Care
Act (ACA) was the single most transformative social policy
change health care has seen since the introduction of Medicare
and Medicaid in the 1960s. With the ACA came continued
evolution of managed care, new reimbursement models and
most importantly coverage for millions of Americans. CCH
faced an uncertain future if it did not respond boldly to these
new circumstances. Our 180-year legacy of caring for the most
vulnerable was challenged by a groundbreaking policy that
would extend coverage to many of our previously uninsured
patients yet leave others behind. There would still be a need for
a public safety net system to care for the 150,000 individuals
who would remain uninsured in Cook County, but would there
be the resources to pay for their needs at a time when we were
trying to stand on our own financial feet? These newly covered
“legacy” CCH patients could now choose to go elsewhere and
take the accompanying reimbursements with them or we could
develop a plan that would allow us to compete for patients
and families we had long served. To succeed would require
multiple strategies to address access and capacity, finances,
equipment, staffing and quality. Failure was not an option.
As always, our patients were relying on us.
Now almost 10 years after the signing of the ACA, CCH is
proudly carrying out its mission with a renewed sense of
commitment and confidence in a far more complex local and
national environment. We have accomplished a great deal
since the ACA was adopted by Congress, but without question
two things stand out: the willingness of the System, our
board and the County board to adapt in a rapidly changing

environment and the creation of CountyCare, our Medicaid
health plan. When I rejoined the System in 2013 and was
subsequently named CEO in 2014, strategic transformation
was well underway. CountyCare was growing and Illinois was
moving rapidly toward mandatory managed care for Medicaid
enrollees. And while the plan was working, other external
realities were crying for attention. Gun violence, a growing
epidemic of opioid-related fatalities, food insecurity, threats
to the ACA and other forms of inequity were increasingly
challenging the communities we have long served. 2016 was a
good time for us to convene and plan the best we could for the
next several years of our ongoing transformation.
IMPACT 2020, our 2017-2019 strategic plan, provided the
roadmap we needed to focus on our future while remaining
true to our historical mission. To shift Cook County Health
from a provider of sick care to a provider of health care. To
focus on quality and safety, every patient, every encounter. To
reconsider our system’s role in the larger health care market.
To integrate our component parts and partner with others.
To grow. To serve. To compete. To advocate. To leverage. To
invest. With the strong direction and support of our board,
we developed a plan that does not sit on a shelf but rather has
served as a guide when our board has contemplated strategic
initiatives designed to protect our mission and better meet the
needs of our patients and communities. We anticipated the
need to be nimble, understanding that significant changes at
the local, state and national levels of government and in health
care could require significant shifts in strategy or at least
temporary distractions.
In the end, IMPACT 2020 prioritized critical initiatives like
improving quality and safety, modernizing our facilities and

Page 93 of 179

IMPACT 2023
Strategic Plan

 investing in our employees. The most tangible result of IMPACT
2020 was the opening of the new Professional Building on
our central campus. With the steadfast commitment of Cook
County Board President Preckwinkle and the support of the
Cook County Board of Commissioners, we replaced the circa
1959 Fantus Clinic with a beautiful, modern facility our patients
and staff deserve. This building is a testament both physically
and symbolically of our commitment to the patients we serve.
Following the opening of the Professional Building in Fall 2018,
we opened a new health center in Arlington Heights in January
2019, and by the end of 2019 we will open new facilities in
North Riverside and Blue Island.
We built the largest Medicaid health plan in the county despite
competing with national brands. We celebrated the 20th
Anniversary of the CORE Center and the 50th Anniversary of
our Trauma Unit. We raised the bar in correctional health and
now serve as a national model for the delivery of high quality
care to the detained. We earned the highly coveted Health
Information Management Systems Society Level 7 designation
for the full integration of our electronic medical record, an
honor that few other systems in the nation have achieved.
We continued to welcome Navy medical personnel into our
renowned trauma unit to exchange knowledge and skills with
our heroes in combat. We attacked the opioid epidemic from
multiple angles and continue to address food and housing
insecurity in meaningful ways. We fought (and will continue
to fight) at every level of government to protect the Affordable
Care Act and expand access to populations it has left behind.
We have leveraged the strengths and expertise of our public
health department to drive strategic decisions that will guide
our population health strategies for years to come. And
importantly, we did all of this (and more) while remaining
responsible stewards of local tax dollars.
IMPACT 2023 requires us to reflect on the past three years
with the future in mind. What’s next? What drives us to
provide the highest quality, most culturally competent care
to every patient, every day with a commitment that fosters
an environment committed to zero harm? What must we do
to thrive in an environment where reimbursements will be
driven by outcomes regardless of how sick the patient was
when they presented to us or the complexity of their social
structures? What is our competitive edge against local and
national systems who enjoy greater brand recognition and far
greater resources? What programs and services do we offer
that will set us apart? How do we advocate for universal access
to affordable, high quality health care for all? How do we

partner with others to best utilize limited resources and make
a measurable impact on the communities we serve? Where are
the gaps in services for the communities that rely on us? How
should CCH and the larger health care industry respond to
the suburbanization of poverty? What will happen if the ACA
is repealed, in part or in whole? How will inevitable hospital
closures impact our communities and how should CCH
respond? How do we supply the increasing demand for charity
care with limited resources? How do we recruit physicians,
nurses and others who reflect the patients we serve? How do
we evolve as both a provider-of-choice and an employer-ofchoice? Can we serve as a catalyst for the type of large-scale
changes that are needed to decrease adverse childhood events,
improve maternal outcomes, improve health equity and
change the trajectory of chronic diseases like hypertension and
diabetes?
These are hard questions without the environmental, socioeconomic and political considerations that exist in our county,
state and nation today. IMPACT 2023 provides some of the
answers and recommendations for the future while recognizing
that unanticipated changes in the environment will require us
to pivot. The coming years will no doubt continue to challenge
us, but there are few organizations that have survived the test
of time with the same core mission as we have.
I am honored to serve as the Chief Executive Officer of this
important community asset, but this is a group effort. It
is a shared commitment to our 180-year-old mission that
has allowed us to be so successful over this last decade.
The support of President Toni Preckwinkle and the Cook
County Board of Commissioners coupled with the vision and
commitment of our independent Board of Directors, has
allowed us to accomplish much to be proud of. I want to thank
our staff for their compassion, their commitment and their
resilience on this journey to transform Cook County Health
into a patient-centered organization that is recognized as the
community asset it is. But most importantly, I want to thank
our patients and our health plan members for placing their
continued trust in us.
We hope that the ambitious plans we have laid out in
IMPACT 2023 demonstrate our continued commitment to the
communities and patients we serve and appropriately honor
the legacy of this noble organization.
Sincerely,

John Jay Shannon, MD
Chief Executive Officer

Healthcare Landscape
NAVIGATING EXTERNAL REALITIES

RISING UNINSURED NUMBERS

Cook County Health holds a unique position in the local, state
and national health care landscape. As such, the decisions,
policies and actions of public officials, private
health systems, insurance carriers and others must be
carefully monitored and used to inform strategies that will
enable CCH to stay true to its 180-year-old mission to care
for all County residents regardless of income, insurance or
immigration status.

In 2016, the number of uninsured individuals in Cook County
(9%), the state of Illinois (7%) and the country (10%) were at a
historic low; a direct result of the Affordable Care Act. Despite
this, CCH has continued to provide more than 50% of all the
charity care in Cook County. In fact, CCH’s proportion of
charity care since the enactment of the ACA has risen despite
decreases experienced by other health care systems. In the
years following the ACA, state and federal actions resulted in
fewer people with coverage, which placed additional demands
on CCH for charity care.

The Affordable Care Act allowed CCH to implement strategies
designed to ensure its financial stability in a local environment
where fewer local tax dollars have been available.

In 2016, 35% of CCH patients were
uninsured, a historic low. In 2018, due to
actions at the state and federal level, that
number increased to 43%.

Efforts and attempts to erode tenets of the ACA at the state
and federal level have had an impact on CCH resulting in an
increased demand for health care by the uninsured. CCH’s
2017-2019 Strategic Plan, IMPACT 2020, contemplated the
need to remain nimble in a highly dynamic environment.
As CCH completes its 2020-2022 strategic plan, continued
attention and responsiveness to external realities will be
required. The following are just a few of the local, state and
federal considerations that CCH will monitor and adapt to over
the course of the next several years.

IMPACT 2020 recognized that the local health care landscape
would face continued consolidations and even some hospital
closures. As health systems consolidate and expand operations
in areas with attractive payor mixes, traditional safety net
institutions will be stressed trying to fill in the gaps. Additional
safety net closures are probable, placing increased expectations
and demands on CCH. Furthermore, consolidations, market
entrances and exits in the managed care space, as well as
changes in Medicaid policy at the state and federal level, will
pose unique challenges or opportunities to CCH as both a
provider of care and a provider-led health plan.
Over the course of IMPACT 2023, additional changes at the
local, state and federal level are fully expected. Policy changes
that impact immigration, chip away at the Affordable Care
Act or even shift the country toward a single payor system
will have enormous impacts on CCH. The ability to leverage
positive changes, pivot where necessary and limit risk will be
key to the future of CCH.

 FOCUS AREA 1
Deliver High
Quality Care

HIGH QUAL
Deliver High Quality Care
There is nothing more fundamental in health care than the
delivery of safe, high quality care for every patient at every
encounter. Over the past three years, intense focus has been
placed on implementing evidence-based, highly reliable
systems to ensure that all patients are provided the same
opportunity to heal regardless of the complexities of their
individual needs. Accreditation by The Joint Commission
(TJC) signifies compliance with standards of care established
by the U.S. Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS).
In the past three years, Stroger and Provident hospitals as
well as CCH’s ambulatory network and Primary Care Medical
Home model have been reaccredited by TJC. In a highly
competitive environment, accreditation must be viewed as the
minimum standard. At CCH, efforts to improve quality and
ensure patient safety are about raising the bar.

Since the adoption of IMPACT 2020, more than 90% of CCH
employees – from physicians to food service workers – have
been trained in “high reliability” practices designed to ensure
that all employees understand how attention to detail, clear
communication, and a questioning attitude assure safe care
of the patient. High reliability training empowers staff at all
levels in the organization to ask questions and raise concerns
where patient and employee safety may be compromised. Daily
safety huddles are now the organizational norm throughout
CCH, providing a scheduled opportunity for multidisciplinary
groups to discuss any matter that may impact patient safety
whether on a specific unit, at a clinic or in correctional health.
Quality initiatives come in all shapes and sizes. They include
large-scale systematic efforts as well as individualized plans
designed to address the needs of our most complex patients
through the vast expansion of care coordination activities over
the past three years.
The needs of a 45-year-old diabetic with heart disease are
vastly different from those of a 30-year-old pregnant woman
with a substance use disorder. One may have a strong family
network that can assist them post-discharge while the other
may not have stable housing or access to healthy foods.
Care management provides patients and health plan members
with a “back-stop” by ensuring that they have access to the
medical and social services needed to improve their health.

Care managers are often nurses or social workers who are
supported by a cadre of professionals from case managers to
community health workers. The addition of more than 200
care managers and community health workers in the past three
years has enabled CCH to offer care management services to
over 8,000 individuals at any given time. Care management
also addresses cultural, legal and linguistic barriers that might
otherwise impede the progress of a patient and links patients
with social services that may improve outcomes such as food
support or housing.
Significant progress has been made in providing care
coordination services at CCH to assist with opioid discharges
and other behavioral health needs. And while today, our care
coordinators have a full panel of patients, the full value of care
coordination will be realized in the coming years as CCH fully
integrates the model across the System connecting all relevant
areas from correctional health to public health, from the
emergency department to inpatient and outpatient settings.
Expert staff and modern facilities are at the core of providing
high quality care.

Specific investments in nursing in the coming years will
move CCH closer to Magnet® Status. A shared governance
model is being implemented that will give frontline nurses
the opportunity to share in decision making that impacts
patient care practices and the work environment. Leadership
development programs will provide critical training to enable
nurses to advance their career at CCH and a nurse residency
program will expose new nurses to CCH earlier in their careerseeking process.
In 2018, CCH finished construction on its first new building
since Stroger Hospital opened in 2002. The 282,000 square
foot professional building at the corner of Polk Street and
Damen Avenue did far more than provide a modern space to
match the care CCH has long provided. It delivered on the
promise to provide high quality care with dignity and respect
and is critical to the System’s growth strategy. It allowed CCH
to create interdisciplinary teams around complex conditions
like cancer. It also enabled the decommissioning of the Fantus
Clinic and the construction of a new parking lot designed to
provide expanded parking for patients.

IMPACT 2023
Strategic Plan

 Significant investments have been made in existing facilities
over the past several years including the renovation of the
fourth floor of Stroger Hospital to create a Women’s and
Children’s Center offering inpatient and outpatient services
in a multi-disciplinary model. Strengthening maternal/
child health services throughout the System with linkages to
additional support services will be imperative as CCH seeks to
improve maternal/child health outcomes in the coming years.
New facilities throughout Cook County will provide much
needed comprehensive services closer to our patients,
including dental and behavioral health, and will include
important linkages to programs like the Women, Infant and
Children’s Supplemental Nutrition Program (WIC). IMPACT
2023 continues to advance an ambitious capital improvement
strategy in new buildings and new equipment.
Health care is dependent on technology. At CCH, this is
best demonstrated by the 1.4 million computer transactions
occurring every day that are dependent on a complex integration
of more than 300 computer applications across the System.
CCH’s journey to providing the highest level of technology
available began in 2002 when the first electronic medical
record (EMR) was implemented. Since that time, CCH has
literally moved from paper medical records to a fully integrated
electronic system across the inpatient, outpatient and
correctional health arenas. An individual who accesses services
at Cook County Jail may see a CCH primary care physician
months after discharge. That patient will have a digital file
that the care team can immediately access, saving time and
money while preventing unnecessary and duplicative testing.
CCH’s commitment to meeting technology advances and
demands was recognized in 2018 by the Health Information
Management Systems Society (HIMSS) as a Stage 7
organization – an honor bestowed on health systems reflecting
the highest standards in the implementation, integration and
execution of the electronic medical record. Less than 10% of
health systems in the United States have earned this distinction.
As technology continues to advance, health care Information
Technology (IT) must keep pace at all levels from online
scheduling of appointments to revenue cycle to security to
artificial intelligence and everything in between. Evaluating,
understanding and executing IT strategies to ultimately
improve health outcomes is a constant process that requires
both human and financial resources.
CCH has also made investments in technology to improve the
patient experience. The health system introduced eConsult

in 2016 which allows a primary care physician the ability to
electronically submit questions or images to a CCH specialist
who reviews and responds to the request in less than 48 hours.
Nearly half the time, the use of eConsult avoids an unnecessary
office or emergency room visit for the patient, thus ensuring
the System has capacity for those who most need it.
Regardless of these investments, CCH’s ability to compete
in the health care environment will depend almost entirely
on its ability to deliver an excellent patient experience as
reflected by our patients and benchmarked by external rating
organizations. IMPACT 2020 set out a number of strategies
to improve the patient experience including increasing the
number of bilingual staff, reducing wait times, providing
cultural competency and customer service training and
launching its own transportation fleet. These are imperative
in a modern health system and IMPACT 2023 recognizes
a number of new opportunities for further improvement
including additional efforts to improve cultural competency.
There is perhaps no clinical service that embodies the mission
of CCH better than Correctional Health. It is where one can
witness firsthand the intersection of multiple inequities in our
society. Caring for the detained populations at the Cook County
Jail and the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center is a complex
yet incredibly rewarding endeavor. The past few years have
brought the opioid and mental health epidemics to the front
door of these facilities. CCH has responded with innovative
programs to care for detainees while in the jail and provides
warm hand-offs to community partners for individuals at
discharge. Since initiating Medicaid applications at the jail
in 2013, more than 20,000 detainees have been enrolled,
providing them with continued access to critical communitybased services upon release. In 2018, CCH realized its goal to
markedly improve the care and services provided to detainees.
Achieving this goal led to the dissolution of a 10-year old U.S.
Department of Justice consent decree. In 2018, CCH began
providing mental health services at the Juvenile Temporary
Detention Center (JTDC) as part of its commitment to provide
comprehensive and integrated behavioral health services
across the organization. Today, the efforts and commitment of
the correctional health team stand as a national model for the
delivery of care to the justice-involved.
Delivering high quality care requires a multi-disciplinary
approach and organizational commitment that extends beyond
the life of any one strategic plan. It is the core of what every
health system sets out to do and CCH is no different.

 FOCUS AREA 2
Grow to Serve
and Compete

GROW TO S
Grow to Serve and Compete
The implementation of the Affordable Care Act and mandatory
managed care in Illinois’ Medicaid program were the catalyst
for CCH to build a comprehensive strategy shifting from
the provision of sick care to the provision of health care.
Reimbursements were no longer based on the number of
individuals seen in a clinic or the procedures performed.
Capitation and value-based reimbursement models
incentivized providers to keep patients healthy and out
of expensive inpatient settings.

As a provider of complex specialty care operating in a managed
care environment, CCH has developed a growth strategy to
increase the number of patients it serves in a primary care
capacity and to increase services to those referred by external
primary care providers. To accomplish this, CCH is in the
midst of a multi-year capital program to renovate, relocate or
rebuild its community health centers using a model that allows
for the expansion of primary care and the integration of more
specialty care in the community. Services such as dental and
behavioral health will be standard in new facilities to address
glaring health inequities in access to these critical services.
Furthermore, prioritizing important relationships with Federally
Qualified Health Centers will require additional specialty care
responsiveness from the System.
On the inpatient side, CCH is planning to build a new, modern
facility on the Provident campus that will consolidate inpatient
and outpatient services to provide exceptional care and attract
new patients. Provident Hospital typically cares for an older
population. A new facility focused on specific service lines
provides CCH with an opportunity to grow both inpatient
and outpatient volumes and offer state-of-the-art diagnostic
services, relieving patients of travel to Stroger Hospital for

common diagnostics or routine treatments. In 2019, Provident
Hospital reopened its Intensive Care Unit and plans to reopen
its busy emergency room to ambulance runs.

IMPACT 2020 also contemplated a growth strategy for the
System’s health plan. As the result of effective acquisition and
marketing strategies and the addition of a member reward
program, today CountyCare stands as the largest Medicaid
managed care plan in Cook County with more than 300,000
members or 30% of the market share. Maintaining market
share in an environment where continued contraction among
managed care plans is likely will require increased focus
on member services, benefits and marketing. Critical to
CCH’s success will be the ability to serve more CountyCare
members at CCH health centers and hospitals and with
various telehealth strategies. IMPACT 2023 lays out a series
of strategies to provide a greater proportion of services to
CountyCare members while keeping CCH doctors and facilities
as network providers in the other Medicaid managed care
plans operating in Cook County. CCH must also effectively
assist members with redetermination and advocate for
systematic improvements in processing eligibility and
redetermination applications at the state level.
More than 14,000 CCH patients or health plan members are
aging into Medicare every year. These are patients who have
established relationships with providers but in the absence of
a specific strategy around aging patients, many historically left
CCH when they transitioned into Medicare coverage. In the
coming year, CCH will execute an innovative strategy that will
provide these patients with coverage options that will enable
coordinated care management, improve transitions of care,
promote timely follow-up and build engagement.

Foster Fiscal Stewardship
As a public institution competing with private health systems,
CCH has to carefully balance every strategy to succeed.
Through the improvements in operations and several
dimensions of the revenue cycle, CCH is proud that it has
reduced its reliance on local taxpayers to fund its operations.
In fact, today, the only operating revenue CCH receives
from local taxpayers funds the Cook County Department of
Public Health and Correctional Health Services wherein CCH
provides services that do not have reimbursement.
The remaining 97% of operating funds are generated by the
health system.

CCH’s local tax support is one of the lowest in the nation when
compared with other large public health systems. Yet without
the financial resources to invest in infrastructure, technology
and employees, CCH will be at a competitive disadvantage,
making it even more critical for CCH to collect every dollar
possible to protect the mission of the organization.
This has been at the center of CCH’s financial strategy over the
past several years. Prior to the enactment of the Affordable
Care Act, CCH had served mostly uninsured individuals and
those in fee-for-service Medicaid. Medicaid reimbursement
was based on the number of individuals cared for in the
inpatient or outpatient setting. Most of our uninsured patients
qualified for charity care, which in 2017 exceeded $296M and
represented 53% of all the charity care provided by hospitals
in Cook County. Without patient fees and other revenues that
assist in covering the uninsured, CCH’s ability to carry out its
mission is seriously threatened.
The simplicity of that historical payor mix did not require
the sophisticated systems that private hospitals had built

and matured over decades of caring for a mainly insured
population. In 2013, CCH had one main payor and by 2018
had more than 20, each with its own processes. Significant
investment in infrastructure, technology, staff and training
was required to succeed in an environment that now includes
multiple Medicaid and Medicare managed care organizations.
From 2013 to 2017, the number of bills generated and the
charges associated with them increased by 50%, a testament
to how far the organization has come in developing a modern
revenue cycle system. The collection of billions of dollars in
earned patient service revenue is what has allowed CCH to
reduce its reliance on local taxpayers over the past 10 years.

Further illustrating CCH’s success since the adoption of
IMPACT 2020, CCH has assumed a significant portion of the
current pension liability for its 6,700 employees and beginning
in 2019, has assumed all debt service on new capital projects.
CCH is working closely with Cook County government on
strategies that will allow it to assume a greater proportion of
its current pension obligations.
CCH has successfully secured more than $23 million in grant
funding since 2016 and the continued maturity of the Cook
County Health Foundation promises additional non-tax
revenue to support CCH initiatives.
Controlling expenses through the utilization of acuity and
clinical activity based staffing models, maximizing automation
and tracking out-of-network expenses, coupled with
advocating for the continuation of important programs like the
Affordable Care Act and the 340B Drug Discount program will
ensure CCH’s continued financial success.

Leverage and Invest in Assets
Employees are the heart of any organization and the primary
determinant of its success. With more than 6,000 employees
working in a 24-7 operation spread across one of the nation’s
largest counties, CCH must be intentional in leveraging and
investing in a workforce that is committed to the historical
mission of the organization, while applying modern
business practices that will achieve success in a competitive
environment and establish CCH as an employer of choice.

Leveraging the workforce starts with a genuine interest in
understanding the workforce. To that end, CCH conducted
an employee engagement survey in 2018 to understand
everything from what motivates them to what frustrates them;
from how they view the organization to how they envision their
future. More than 3,000 employees completed the survey.
The results of the survey have been used to develop strategies
to better engage employees at both the department and
system level. Departments will report out on their strategies
at monthly leadership meetings, sharing ideas, successes and
challenges across the organization. Additionally, a multidisciplinary employee engagement committee is working on a
number of system-wide strategies including formal ‘employee
of the month’ and service anniversary programs.
Fundamental to staffing an efficient, modern and complex
health care system is the ability to recruit and retain top
talent and to prioritize workforce training and development,
offer a competitive compensation structure and provide an
environment that allows professionals the opportunity to
work at the top of their license. Today’s health care systems,
including CCH, are leveraging the skills and talents of new roles
like care coordinators and community health care workers to
complement the work of others and meet the needs of patients
in the most culturally sensitive and convenient manner possible.
CCH is fortunate that its employees are deeply committed to
the mission but has been challenged in providing education,
career development and other investments that are customary
in private health systems. Timely recruitment is an important
consideration as the health care workforce remains competitive.
CCH faces a number of requirements, not applicable to our
competitors, that increase the time it takes to hire. From
compliance with the employment plan and requirements
from the Collective Bargaining Agreements, CCH must work

with its labor partners to identify and implement tactics that
respect these requirements but that allow CCH to operate in a
competitive environment where employees can be recruited and
on-boarded quickly and where compensation is aligned with
role complexity, market realities, and performance.
CCH has recently introduced a catalogue with dozens of
training opportunities for leaders and employees and looks
forward to expanding educational opportunities across
the organization regardless of position or grade. These
opportunities must focus on operational and individual skillbuilding as well as large-scale organizational imperatives from
retaining insured populations to improving maternal-child
health outcomes.
The implementation of the county-wide performance
management system will provide additional opportunities
for employees and their managers to discuss professional
development as well as individual goals and objectives on a
routine basis. CCH seeks to work with its labor and county
partners to identify growth opportunities that recognize
employment longevity as well as specific union seniority.
CCH will continue to tackle serious public health concerns
from lead poisoning and violence to sexually transmitted
infections using evidence-based approaches, community
outreach and even traditional marketing strategies to ensure
that the communities impacted have a deep understanding
of the issues and access to a portfolio of services designed to
prevent and/or mitigate injury and disease. These efforts will
require CCH to collaborate with other organizations including
the Chicago Department of Public Health to maximize
resources and impact.
CCH has historically been an insular organization focused on
sick care. In recent years, efforts have been made to broaden the
understanding and promotion of the health system and health
plan throughout the county. CCH’s Community Affairs team
participates in approximately 400 events annually. Additionally,
CCH staff across multiple areas chair or sit on the boards and
committees of dozens of community-based organizations
in an effort to raise awareness of the programs and services
and identify opportunities to link patients or individuals to
additional services. IMPACT 2023 contemplates a multi-

Page 114 of 179

 disciplinary Community Affairs plan that includes health and
educational programming at CCH sites based on community
needs, participation in additional outreach events and increased
collaboration between CCH’s community health centers and
the communities they serve. IMPACT 2023 will also see the
completion the of implementation of Community Advisory
Councils (CACs) at all its centers. The CACs are designed to
ensure that CCH has a deep understanding of the communities
with the goal of providing additional programs and services
tailored to the needs of the individual communities.
Perhaps CCH’s best kept secret is the research it has long
conducted to discover or improve treatments, identify linkages
between health and social determinants and offer clinical trials
to its patients. In recent years, CCH has worked to leverage
the expertise of its clinical and social research teams beyond
these traditional avenues. Establishing CCH physicians and

operational leaders as experts in areas beyond the traditional
care setting has broadened awareness of the important
research that CCH has conducted. Taking this to the next
level, in 2019, CCH began a series of Research & Innovation
Summits. The Summits provide an opportunity to organize
and elevate CCH’s research, clinical and advocacy efforts
into a half-day learning and sharing session for interested
stakeholders. The Summits have proven invaluable to foster
collaboration and further potential funding opportunities.
CCH aspires to create a Center for Health Equity and
Innovation which will enable it to house several component
parts of the organization, creating an intentional and
collaborative strategy around health equity and advocating for
innovative approaches to addressing existing and emerging
population health challenges.

 FOCUS AREA 5
Impact Social
Determinants and

Advocate For Patients

LEVERAGE
Impact Social Determinants
and Advocate for Patients
Health equity has been at the center of CCH’s mission for more
than 180 years. CCH is proud of its work to provide care to
all regardless of a patient’s income, insurance or immigration
status and will continue to advocate at all levels of government
until everyone has adequate coverage for comprehensive care
including access to preventive care. CCH has seen a concerning
increase in its uninsured population since the individual
mandate under the Affordable Care Act was repealed in 2017.
This is an area that CCH is monitoring closely. Local, state and
federal policy changes should be enacted to ensure that CCH can
continue to deliver care to all who need it in a timely fashion.
Rather than waiting for uninsured patients to present with
acute needs in the emergency room, CCH expanded its charity
care program, CareLink, to provide enrollees with primary
care, behavioral health and care management for the most
complex patients with the goal of preventing expensive
emergency room visits and improving outcomes. More than
31,000 Cook County residents have been enrolled in the
program since it started in 2017.
CCH fully recognizes that health equity goes beyond the
walls of a hospital or the doors of a clinic. Providing “whole
person” care means understanding the circumstances of every
individual and working to address the issues that impact their
health status. Access to nutritious food and stable housing,
economic opportunity, safe neighborhoods with access to
public transportation, education and gender equity are all
social determinants of health impacting the health status of an
individual. CCH has expanded efforts in addressing food and
housing insecurity over the past three years and has ambitious
plans for the next three years including placing hundreds of
individuals in stable housing.
Perhaps there is nothing that illuminates the intersection of
social determinants of health and CCH’s role in advocating
for its patients more than the epidemic of gun violence in
the communities CCH serves. As the busiest trauma center
in Illinois, Stroger Hospital cares for approximately 1,000
victims of gun violence each year at an annual cost upwards
of $50 million, yet the real cost of violence is the impact it has

on the victims, their families and their communities. Healing
Hurt People (HHP), CCH’s violence prevention program,
provides violently injured youth with support and addresses
the psychological trauma that can drive or result from the
cycle of violence. HHP makes a positive impact on patients:
increasing their safety, providing opportunities for support and
peer learning, helping them to enroll in or stay in school, find
jobs, navigate medical systems and link them to social services
and trauma-specific mental health services. Recent research
demonstrated that for participants who received HHP services
for at least six months, 84% experienced decreases in PostTraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms, 89% exhibited
increased self-efficacy, 80% engaged in less aggressive behavior
and 8% were reinjured, far below historical reinjury rates.
Gun violence and injury prevention require a multi-faceted
approach. CCH intends to leverage the work of its Traumainformed Taskforce, an IMPACT 2020 initiative, to broaden its
efforts in the coming years.
CCH’s work in the justice-involved population is making a
difference in the lives of individuals who find themselves
incarcerated as the result of undiagnosed or untreated
mental health or substance use disorders. From increased
services in the community to prevent unnecessary detention,
comprehensive care during detention and connections to care
upon release, CCH believes there is a real chance to break the
cycle of recidivism for this vulnerable population.
In 2020, the U.S. Census will take center-stage throughout
the country. The importance of an accurate “count” is critical
to CCH and its patients therefore CCH will work closely with
the Cook County Complete Count Committee to identify
opportunities to engage patients and staff in the process.
Ultimately, there must be large-scale efforts that provide
solutions, improvements and opportunities for all residents
of Cook County to achieve their highest potential. To that end,
Cook County Health is committed to advancing a Health In All
Policies (HIAP) approach that incorporates health, equity and
sustainability considerations into decision-making across sectors
and policy areas to improve the quality of life for its residents.

Care Act” is used to refer to the final, amended version of the law.
The law seeks to decrease the number of uninsured, improve
health outcomes and streamline the delivery of health care.

Pay for Performance – In the healthcare industry, pay for
performance (P4P), also known as “ value-based purchasing,”
is a payment model that offers financial incentives to
physicians, hospitals, medical groups, and other healthcare
providers for meeting certain performance measures.
Payor Mix – The distribution of revenue across payor sources
– e.g., Medicare, Medicaid, private, or commercial insurance.
Per-Member-Per-Month (PMPM) – One of the most
common payment arrangements for managed care. A PMPM
agreement is when a health care provider is paid a set amount
for each individual enrolled or “empaneled” with them. The
PMPM remains the same for an individual whether they
receive no health care services in a month, or very intensive
health care services.

Population Health – The health outcomes of an entire
population or an approach that aims to improve the health of
an entire population.
Primary Care Medical Home (PCMH) – A care delivery
model whereby patient treatment is coordinated through a
primary care team to ensure the patient receives the necessary
care when and where they need it, in a manner they can
understand. Patients are ‘empaneled’ or part of a ‘panel’ with a
specific provider.

Race, Ethnicity and Language – Qualitative patient data
which is collected to assess health disparities across groups
and is standardized according to Agency for Healthcare
Research and Quality recommendations.

 Relative Value Units (RVU) – An RVU is a dollar amount
that is assigned to each encounter, procedure, or surgery.
The value is standardized, but the way the value is used in the
compensation formula may vary from employer to employer.

Request for Proposal – A detailed specification of goods
or services required by an organization, sent to potential
contractors or suppliers.

Shakman Decrees – A series of Federal court orders regarding
government employment in Chicago, which were issued in
1972, 1979, and 1983, in response to a lawsuit filed by civic
reformer Michael Shakman. The decrees barred the practice of
political patronage, under which government jobs are given to
supporters of a politician or party, and government employees
may be fired for not supporting a favored candidate or party.

Six Sigma – A process-improvement methodology that relies
on a collaborative team effort to improve performance by
systematically removing waste.

Skilled Nursing Facility – Skilled Nursing Facility provides
nursing and therapy care that can only be safely and effectively
performed by, or under the supervision of, professionals or
technical personnel. It’s health care given when you need
skilled nursing or skilled therapy to treat, manage, and observe
your condition, and evaluate your care.

Social Determinants of Health – According to the World
Health Organization (WHO), the social determinants of health
are the conditions in which people are born, grow, work, live,
and age, and the wider set of forces and systems shaping the
conditions of daily life. These forces and systems include
economic policies and systems, development agendas, social
norms, social policies and political systems.

Social Security Income/Social Security Disability Income –
SSI is a need-based disability benefits program for people with
household income under a certain amount. SSDI is a disability
benefits program that is dispensed to qualifying people who
have worked a certain number of years.
Tertiary Care – Health care delivered by specialists. Patients
are often referred to these specialists by their primary care
physicians for consultations on advanced medical treatments.

Trauma Center – A hospital equipped and staffed to provide
care for patients suffering from major traumatic injuries such

as falls, motor vehicle collisions, or gunshot wounds. Trauma
centers vary in their specific capabilities and are identified
by the Illinois Department of Public Health by “Level”
designation: Level-I (Level-1) being the highest, to Level-III
(Level-3) being the lowest (some states have five designated
levels, in which case Level-V (Level-5) is the lowest). Stroger
Hospital is home to the busiest Level-I trauma center in
Illinois and one of the busiest in the nation.

Triple Aim – The Institute for Healthcare Improvement’s
(IHI) Triple Aim is a framework that describes an approach to
optimizing health system performance. It includes designs that
must be developed to simultaneously pursue three dimensions
to: 1) improve the patient’s experience including quality and
satisfaction; 2) improve the population’s health; and 3) reduce
the per capita cost of health care.
Uncompensated Care – Health care or services provided by
hospitals or health care providers that are not reimbursed
from the patient or from third-party payers. Often
uncompensated care arises when people are uninsured or
underinsured and cannot afford to pay the cost of care. Some
costs for these services may be covered through cost shifting.

Underinsured – People with public or private insurance policies
that do not cover all necessary health care services, resulting in
out-of-pocket expenses that exceed their ability to pay.

U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services – The federal
agency that oversees the Medicare and Medicaid programs in
conjunction with state governments.

Vizient™ – A company that focuses on health care data sharing
to allow health care providers relevant benchmarking data.

Voice Over Internet Protocol – Technology that allows
internet connection to be used for voice communications.

Wait Time – Period of time before a patient is seen by a
medical professional.
WEPlan – A process mandated by the State of Illinois for local
health department certification conducted every five years.

WIC – The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for
Women, Infants, and Children offers grants to States to
provide pregnant and postpartum women and children up to
age 5 at nutritional risk with supplemental foods, health care
referrals and nutrition education.

CCH is in the process of developing its 2020-2022 strategic plan. In addition to more than 20 presentations to the
CCH Board of Directors, CCH has held town hall meetings for staff and the community.

It is important for us to hear from as many employees as possible as we develop specific strategies to guide our
success in the coming years. Additionally, the strategic plan will serve as the foundation for our 2020-2022 budgets.

This survey should take no longer than 20 minutes and does not require any personal contact information. Your
engagement and feedback are greatly appreciated. Please complete this survey by 5/27/2019.

shall be based upon revenue estimates contained in the
approved Strategic and Financial Plan applicable to that
budget year.
(2) Each Preliminary Budget shall contain such information
and detail as may be prescribed by the County’s Budget
Director. Any applicable fund deficit for the Fiscal Year
ending in 2008 and for any Fiscal Year thereafter shall be
included as an expense item in the succeeding Fiscal Year’s

(e) The County Board shall approve each Preliminary Budget
if, in its judgment, the Budget is complete, is reasonably
capable of being achieved, and will be consistent with the
Strategic and Financial Plan in effect for that Fiscal Year.

within 45 days of submission to the County Board or such
Preliminary Budget is deemed approved. Such Preliminary
Budget shall be included in the President’s Executive Budget

the Annual Appropriation Ordinance. If, in the discretion
of the County Board, and notwithstanding the approved
Annual Appropriation Ordinance, the County Board

of this section shall be voidable by the County Board. An
expenditure limitation established by the County Board
shall remain in effect for that Fiscal Year or unless revoked
earlier by the County Board.
(2) The System Board shall report to the President and
the County Board at such times and in such manner as the

financial statements, require the System Board to produce
reports, and have access to any other information in the
possession of the System Board which the President and
the County Board deem relevant. The County Board may

the System Board to assure compliance with the Annual
Appropriation Ordinance. The System Board shall produce
such financial data, financial statements, reports and other
information and comply with such directives.
(3) After approval of each Annual Appropriation Ordinance,
the System Board shall promptly notify the President and
the County Board of any material change in the revenues
or expenditures set forth in the Annual Appropriation
Ordinance. In Fiscal Year 2009 and thereafter, the System
Board has the authority to make intra-fund transfers within
the Public Health Fund, if necessary, to accommodate any
proposed revisions by the System Board to the line items
set forth in the Annual Appropriation Ordinance. Such
transfers shall be reported by the CEO in the quarterly
reports required in Subsection 38-81(e) of this article.
(4) The County Comptroller is hereby authorized to
process invoices and make payments against line items
set forth in the Annual Appropriation Ordinance at the
direction of the System Board or, if authorized by the

necessary for the Comptroller to perform this accounts

 written rules, regulations and procedures with regard to these
functions. Until such time as the System Board adopts its own
rules, regulations or procedures with regard to these functions,
the existing Personnel Rules, regulations and procedures of
the County shall apply. The System Board may exercise the
authority granted in this section, in whole or in part, pursuant
to its discretion and consistent with existing collective
bargaining agreements and obligations.
(b) Employees within the CCHHS are employees of the County,
and as such, shall be free from any political interference in
accordance with the Supplemental Relief Order and Consent

Northern District of Illinois under Case No. 69 C 2145 and
titled “Shakman, et al. v. Democratic Organization, et al.”

collective bargaining agreements covering CCHHS employees.
All such collective bargaining agreements must be approved by
the System Board and the County Board.
(d) The System Board or the CEO shall not hire or appoint any
person in any position in the CCHHS unless it is consistent
with the Annual Appropriation Ordinance in effect at the time
of hire or appointment.
(e) Nothing herein shall diminish the rights of Cook County

agreement and who, pursuant to this article, are placed
under the jurisdiction of the System Board, nor diminish the
historical representation rights of said employees’ exclusive
bargaining representatives, nor shall anything herein change
the designation of “Employer” pursuant to the Illinois Public

regard to these functions, which must be consistent with the
provisions set forth in the Cook County Code on Procurement
and Contracts; provided, however, that approval of the County
Board or County Purchasing Agent required under the Cook
County Code on Procurement and Contracts is not required
for procurement and contracts within the CCHHS. The System

Board shall act in place of the County Board in any contract,
bylaws or agreement with the County which requires the
approval or other action of the County Board unless expressly
prohibited otherwise in this article or unless the contract
expressly provides that the System Board shall not have such
authority. Until such time as the System Board adopts its own
rules, regulations or procedures with regard to Procurement
and Contracts, the existing provisions of the Cook County
Code pertaining to Procurement and Contracts shall apply.
The System Board may exercise the authority granted in this
section, in whole or in part, pursuant to its discretion.
(b) No contract or other obligation shall be entered into by
the System Board unless it is consistent with the Annual
Appropriation Ordinance in effect.
(c) Any multiyear contracts entered into by the System
Board must contain a provision stating that the contract is
subject to County Board approval of appropriations for the
purpose of the subject contract; and that in the event funds
are not appropriated by the County Board, the contract shall
be cancelled without penalty to, or further payment being
required by, the System Board or the County. The System
Board shall give the vendor notice of failure of funding as
soon as practicable after the System Board becomes aware of
the failure of funding. Multiyear contracts shall also contain
provisions that the System Board’s or County’s obligation to
perform shall cease immediately upon receipt of notice to the
vendor of lack of appropriated funds; and that the System
Board’s or County’s obligation under the contract shall also
be subject to immediate termination or cancellation at any
time when there are not sufficient authorized funds lawfully
available to the System Board to meet such obligation.
(Ord. No. 08-O-35, 5-20-2008.)

Board of such interest.
(b) This interest shall be set forth in the minutes of the System
Board and the Director, agent, or professional or business
advisor or CEO having such interest shall not participate on
behalf of the CCHHS in any way with regard to such contract
or transaction unless the System Board or County Board
waives the conflict.
