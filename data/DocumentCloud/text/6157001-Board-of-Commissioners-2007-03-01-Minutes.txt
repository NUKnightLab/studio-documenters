 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 1, 2007
BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF COOK COUNTY
PRESIDENT
VETO
Transmitting a Communication, dated February 26, 2007 from
TODD H. STROGER, President, Cook County Board of Commissioners
In accordance with the authority granted to me by section 2-6008 of the Counties Code and for the
reasons stated herein, I hereby transmit to you my veto of the Sulfur Dioxide Emissions Tax Ordinance
that was passed by the Board of Commissioners via the Finance (Public Hearing) Committee Report of
February 20, 2007 approved on February 21, 2007. Please place my veto message on the agenda for the
next meeting of the Cook County Board of Commissioners on March 1, 2007.
Please be advised that I am exercising my veto authority as President of the Board of Commissioners and
hereby veto the Ordinance approving the Sulfur Dioxide Emissions Tax adopted on February 21, 2007.
This Ordinance imposes a tax upon sources that emit 100 tons or more of sulfur dioxide within Cook
County in a twelve month period. The Ordinance further indicates that the tax shall be levied at a rate of
$400 for each ton of sulfur dioxide emitted in a twelve month period and shall be remitted on a semiannual basis.
Sulfur dioxide gas emissions are harmful to our environment and to the health of our citizens; however
taxing such emissions is not the appropriate method for reducing said emissions. I oppose this Ordinance
on the grounds that said emissions should not attempt to be controlled through a Cook County tax but
rather, said emissions should be regulated by County, State, and Federal Government in order to fully
protect our environment and the health of our citizens.
Sulfur Dioxide is listed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) as a criteria air pollutant
under the Clean Air Act, for which it sets health-based air quality standards. Sulfur dioxide reacts with
the air upon emission and forms sulfate particles, a form of fine particulate matter, also listed as a criteria
air pollutant. The EPA strengthened the fine particulate standard in 2006, however, not to the level that
its own Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee stated is necessary to protect public health.
I have directed the County’s Department of Environmental Control to determine County appropriate
regulations in an effort to reduce sulfur dioxide and other harmful green house emissions. Furthermore, I
encourage this Board and the residents of Cook County to petition the appropriate Federal and State
authorities to further regulate sulfur dioxide emissions and other green house emissions and reduce the
level of what is deemed to be an acceptable emission. Taxes on said emissions do not protect our
environment or aid in the health of our citizens, rather greater regulation on said emissions by County,
State and Federal government is needed.
For these reasons I urge you to reconsider your support of the Sulfur Dioxide Emissions Tax Ordinance.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 1, 2007
(b) Notwithstanding any rules to the contrary, the following filing fee amounts shall apply:
(1) The filing fee for a site emitting less than 25 tons per year of any combination of Regulated
Air Pollutants as reported by their previous year Annual Illinois Air Emission Report (AER), is $1000
with an annual fee of $5 per ton of the total tonnage of any combination of regulated air pollutants.
(2) The filing fee for a site emitting at least 25 tons per year but less than 50 tons per year of any
combination of Regulated Air Pollutants as reported by their previous year Annual Illinois Air Emission
Report (AER), is $1,500 with an annual fee of $10 per ton of the total tonnage of any combination of
regulated air pollutants.
(3) The filing fee for a site emitting at least 75 tons but less than 100 tons per year of any
combination of Regulated Air Pollutants as reported by their previous year Annual Illinois Air Emission
Report (AER), is $2,000 with an annual fee of $15 per ton of the total tonnage of any combination of

(a) Only one air pollution site fee may be collected from any site, even if such site receives more
than one air pollution control permit.
Sec. 30-396. Rules and Regulations.
(a) The Cook County Department of Environmental Control shall establish procedures for the
collection of air pollution site fees. Air pollution site fees may be paid annually, or in advance for the
number of years for which the permit is issued, at the option of the owner or operator. Payment in
advance does not exempt the owner or operator from paying any increase in the fee that may occur during
the term of the permit; the owner or operator must pay the amount of the increase upon and from the
effective date of the increase.
(b) The Cook County Department of Environmental Control may deny an application for the
issuance, transfer, or renewal of an air pollution operating permit if any air pollution site fee owed by the
applicant has not been paid within 60 days of the due date, unless the applicant, at the time of application,
pays to the Department in advance the air pollution site fee for the site that is the subject of the operating
permit, plus any other air pollution site fees then owed by the applicant. The denial of an air pollution
operating permit for failure to pay an air pollution site fee shall be subject to review by the County
Environmental Control Board of Appeals pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 30, Article II, Division 4.
Section 30-123 of the Counties Code.
(c) If the Cook County Department of Environmental Control determines that an owner or operator
of a site was required, but failed, to timely obtain an air pollution operating permit, and as a result avoided
the payment of permit fees, the Department may collect the avoided permit fees with or without pursuing
enforcement. The avoided permit fees shall be calculated as double the amount that would have been
owed had a permit been timely obtained. Fees collected pursuant to this subsection shall be deposited into
the Cook County General Fund.
(d) If the Cook County Department of Environmental Control determines that an owner or operator
of a site was required, but failed, to timely obtain an air pollution operating permit and as a result avoided
the payment of permit fees, an enforcement action may be brought. In addition to any other relief that
may be obtained as part of this action, the Cook County Department of Environmental Control may seek
to recover the avoided permit fees. The avoided permit fees shall be calculated as double the amount that
would have been owed had a permit been timely obtained. Fees collected pursuant to this subsection (d)
shall be deposited into the Cook County General Fund.

960

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 1, 2007

(e) If a Permittee subject to a fee under this Section fails to pay the fee within 90 days of its due date,
or makes the fee payment from an account with insufficient funds to cover the amount of the fee payment,
the Department shall notify the Permittee of the failure to pay the fee. If the Permittee fails to pay the fee
within 60 days after such notification, the Department may, by written notice, immediately revoke the air
pollution operating permit. Failure of the Cook County Department of Environmental Control to notify
the Permittee of failure to pay a fee due under this Section, or the payment of the fee from an account
with insufficient funds to cover the amount of the fee payment, does not excuse or alter the duty of the
Permittee to comply with the provisions of this Section.
Sec. 30-397.
Emission Levels Reduction.
Sites where the levels of pollution emissions exceed 100 tons/year for any of the Regulated Air
Pollutants, said Site Permitees shall be required to submit an annual Regulated Air Pollutant Emission
Reduction Plan to the Cook County Department of Environmental Control for the Department’s approval
in an effort to decrease either the Site’s cumulative regulated pollutant emissions or specific individual
pollutant emissions by 5% within the term of the air pollution operating permit.
(a) Annual Regulated Air Pollutant Emission Reduction Plans submitted to the Cook County
Department of Environmental Control will be verified by reviewing the Site/Permitee’s Illinois Annual
Air Emission Report (AER).
(b) Each Site/Permittee will be required to submit its Illinois Annual Air Emission Report (AER) to
the Cook County Department of Environmental Control within 1 month of the submittal of the AER to
the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (“IEPA”).
(c) Additionally each Site/Permittee will be required to submit quarterly reports detailing the
individual pollution emission levels for its fuel burning devices and cumulative values of pollution
emissions within the quarterly period.
(d) Established Regulated Air Pollutant emission reductions exceeding 10% on an annual basis will
allow a 10% credit reduction of the following year annual air permit fee.
(e) Failure to reduce Regulated Air Pollutant emissions as indicated in the County approved
Reduction Plan may result in penalty fees or loss of permit.
Sec. 30-398. Effective Date. This Ordinance shall take effect within ninety (90) days upon passage.

PROPOSED ORDINANCE
COOK COUNTY PROMPT PAYMENT ACT
BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that Chapter 34, Article IV, Section
34-128 of the Cook County Code is hereby enacted as follows:
Sec. 34-128. Cook County Prompt Payment Act.
(a) Payment of contractors. The appropriate Cook County official or agency receiving goods or
services must approve or disapprove a bill from a vendor or contractor for goods or services furnished to
the local governmental agency within 30 days after the receipt of such bill or within 30 days after the date
on which the goods or services were received, whichever is later. If one or more items on a construction
related bill or invoice are disapproved, but not the entire bill or invoice, then the portion that is not
disapproved shall be paid. When safety or quality assurance testing of goods by the local governmental
agency is necessary before the approval or disapproval of a bill and such testing cannot be completed
within 30 days after receipt of the goods, approval or disapproval of the bill must be made immediately
upon completion of the testing or within 60 days after receipt of the goods, whichever occurs first.
Written notice shall be mailed to the vendor or contractor immediately if a bill is disapproved.
(b) Failure to pay contractor. Any bill approved for payment pursuant to Subsection (a) shall be
paid within 30 days after the date of approval. If payment is not made within such 30 day period, an
interest penalty of 1% of any amount approved and unpaid shall be added for each month or fraction
thereof after the expiration of such 30 day period, until final payment is made.
(c) Failure to approve payment. If the Cook County official or agency whose approval is
required for any bill fails to approve or disapprove that bill within the period provided for approval by
Subsection (a), the penalty for late payment of that bill shall be computed from the date 60 days after the
receipt of that bill or the date 60 days after the goods or services are received, whichever is later.

962

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 1, 2007
(d) Agreement between County and contractor. The time periods specified in Subsections (a),
(b) and (c), as they pertain to particular goods or services, are superseded by any greater time periods as
agreed to by the County and the particular vendor or contractor.
(e) Funds controlled by the State. As authorized in 50 ILCS 505/7, if the funds from which the
Cook County official or agency is to pay for goods or services are funds appropriated or controlled by the
State, then the local governmental official or agency may certify to the State Treasurer, Comptroller and
State agency responsible for administering such funds that a specified amount is anticipated to be
necessary within 45 days after certification to pay for specified goods or services and that such amount is
not currently available to the local governmental official or agency. The State Treasurer, Comptroller and
State agency shall than expedite distribution of funds to the local governmental unit to make such
payments. The certification shall be mailed on the date of certification by certified U. S. mail, return
receipt requested. Any interest penalty incurred by the local governmental unit under Subsection (b) or (c)
because of the failure of funds to be distributed from the State to the local governmental unit within the
45 day period shall be reimbursed by the State to the local governmental unit as an amount in addition to
the funds to be otherwise distributed from the State.
(f) Payments to subcontractors and material suppliers; failure to make timely payments;
additional amount due. When a contractor receives any payment, the contractor shall pay each
subcontractor and material supplier in proportion to the work completed by each subcontractor and
material supplier their application less any retention. If the contractor receives less than the full payment
due under the public construction contract, the contractor shall be obligated to disburse on a pro rata basis
those funds received, with the contractor, subcontractors and material suppliers each receiving a prorated
portion based on the amount of payment. All interest payments received pursuant to Section 3 also shall
be disbursed to subcontractors and material suppliers to whom payment has been delayed, on a pro rata
basis. When, however, the public owner does not release the full payment due under the contract because
there are specific areas of work or materials the contractor is rejecting or because the contractor has
otherwise determined such areas are not suitable for payment, then those specific subcontractors or
suppliers involved shall not be paid for that portion of the work rejected or deemed not suitable for
payment and all other subcontractors and suppliers shall be paid in full.
If the contractor, without reasonable cause, fails to make any payment to his subcontractors
and material suppliers within 15 days after receipt of payment under the public construction contract, the
contractor shall pay to his subcontractors and material suppliers, in addition to the payment due them,
interest in the amount of 2% per month, calculated from the expiration of the 15 day period until fully
paid. This Section shall also apply to any payments made by subcontractors and material suppliers to
their subcontractors and material suppliers and to all payments made to lower tier subcontractors and
material suppliers throughout the contracting chain.
Effective Date. This Act takes effect immediately upon approval.

WHEREAS, the 2007 Cook County Budget approved same day reduces the Cook County Sheriff’s
Police Department by thirty five to fifty police officers; and
WHEREAS, the members of the Cook County Sheriff’s Police Department are trained professionals in
law enforcement, complying with all statutory requirements to act as police men and women, and
members of a collective bargaining unit; and

support for the Department of Radiology, Radiation Division.

977

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 1, 2007

Reason:

Varian Medical Systems is the proprietary and sole licensor of this system necessary to
upgrade the Varis Vision radiation oncology information system owned by the hospital. The
hospital required immediate replacement of this system that was beyond repair for patient
safety in that it monitors the dose of radiation therapy given to patients. Without immediate
software upgrade, radiation therapy to cancer patients would have to have been stopped – an
absolutely untenable situation which would have left patients without this life-saving therapy.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $164,923.00. (717/897-540 Account).
Sufficient funds have been appropriated to cover this request.

OFFICE OF THE STATE'S ATTORNEY
GRANT AWARD RENEWAL
Transmitting a Communication, dated February 6, 2007 from
DENNIS MANZKE, Chief of the Administrative Services Bureau, State’s Attorney’s Office
requesting authorization to renew a grant in the amount of $832,345.00 from the Illinois Criminal Justice
Information Authority (ICJIA) for continued funding for the Sexual Assault/Domestic Violence
Prosecution Coordination Program. This program is, in essence, the combination of five (5) grants that
were once separate. The five (5) separate programs were: Sex Offender Prosecution Program, Chicago
Response, Domestic Violence Resource Center, Domestic Violence Suburban Coordinator, and Total
Response. By combining these programs into one, Violence Against Women program, the State’s
Attorney’s Office is able to better utilize staff and resources to effectively address the combined issues of
sexual assault and domestic violence. In addition, the combined program allows for more efficient
administration and oversight of the various components of the program. The program dedicates seven (7)
assistant state’s attorneys, four (4) investigators, two (2) victim specialists, one (1) resource specialist and
one (1) administrative support staff.
This grant requires that the office match one (1) dollar for each three (3) dollars of federal funding. The
match commitment for this program will be the salary and fringe benefits of one (1) existing staff person
as well as a cash match that will fund two (2) positions.
This grant does not require an application process; the funding is automatically renewed.

995

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 1, 2007
The authorization to accept the previous grant was given on March 1, 2006 by the Cook County Board of
Commissioners in the amount of $832,345.00 with a match of $277,448.00 and an over-match of
$212,426.00.
The Budget Department has reviewed this item, and all requisite documents have been submitted.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: $292,228.00 [$74,040.00 – (250-110 Account); $22,629.00 – (250-170/179
Accounts); and $195,559.00 – (250-818 Account)]. Grant Award: $832,345.00. Funding period:
