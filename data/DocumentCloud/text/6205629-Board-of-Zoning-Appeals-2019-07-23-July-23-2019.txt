Ali Zeineddine request to change a nonconforming (current legal use of
12730 Joy Road a Motor Vehicle Car Wash, by permit number 95834,
issued January 16, 2007 while the current legal use of 12726, 12734 and
12738 Joy Rd. is vacant land) to a nonconforming Used Auto Sales in a
1,400 square foot building established via rezoning (BSEED Case No.
133-17) to B2 Zone (Local Business and Residential District), also there
is one Used Auto Sales Lot within 1000 sq. ft. This case is appealed
because a non-conforming use may be changed to another
nonconforming use only where reviewed and approved by the Board of
Zoning Appeals in accordance with the procedures that are specified in
Section 61-2-46 of this Code and the Board of Zoning Appeals may
approve such change of use only where the Body determines that the
new proposed use will be less injurious to the surrounding area than the
previous nonconforming use. Also, Used Motor Sales Lots cannot be
established within 1,000’ of another Used Motor Vehicle Sales Lot. There
is one existing used auto sales lots within 1,000 feet of this property:
10614 Joy Rd. (Sections 61-15-20 Change of Use to Other
Nonconforming Use, 61-15-17 Required Findings, 61-4-92(1&3) Other

medical marihuana caregiver center: One thousand (1,000) radial feet from any zoning
lot occupied by another medical marihuana caregiver center. The proposed use is within
1,000 radial feet of one (1) medical marihuana caregiver center located at 10 E. Eight Mile
