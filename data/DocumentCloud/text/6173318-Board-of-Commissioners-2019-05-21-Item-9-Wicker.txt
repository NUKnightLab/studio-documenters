Recommendation
It is recommended that the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority (CHA): 1)
Approve a Pre-Qualified Development Team, the Pennrose-Bickerdike Team, to co-develop the
Wicker Park site with the CHA; 2) Authorize the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to
negotiate and execute a development agreement and joint venture agreement for the codevelopment of the Wicker Park site (inclusive of the rehabilitation of the existing CHA Wicker
Park Apartments and Annex Senior buildings); and 3) Authorize the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to execute and deliver such other documents and perform such actions as may be
necessary or appropriate to implement the foregoing.
The requested action in this item complies in all material respects with all applicable Federal,
State and Local laws and CHA board policies. Staff have completed all necessary due diligence to
support the submission of this initiative.
Property Summary
The Wicker Park site is approximately 3.42 acres and located in a key transit-oriented area. The
site is bounded by N. Damen Avenue, W. Le Moyne Street, the alley west of Damen Avenue and
W. Schiller Street. The site is across from Wicker Park and a short walk to the CTA Damen Brown
line stop. CHA plans to enter in a joint venture partnership with the selected developer to
redevelop the entire site, including the rehabilitation of the existing CHA Wicker Park Apartments
and Annex Senior Buildings.
Funding
No funding requested at this time.
Background
On October 4, 2018, CHA released an Opportunity Notice for Proposal (“Notice”) for a mixeduse/mixed-income development at the Northwest corner of N. Damen and W. Schiller. The
Notice invited approved Pre-Qualified Development Teams to submit development proposals for

 the Wicker Park site by the submission deadline date – November 30, 2018. The notified PreQualified Development Teams were previously approved under the following PDT Solicitations:
RFQ No.2445(2018), RFQ No.2385 (2017), and RFQ No.1583 (2016).

Procurement Process
• CHA issued RFQ No. 2445 (2018), RFQ No. 2385 (2017), and RFQ No. 1583 (2016) to solicit
Pre-Qualified Development Teams to engage in the acquisition, development and
management of mixed-income developments and family units in Opportunity and
General Areas.
• The Pre-Qualified Development Program permits the CHA to receive proposals from an
established group of developers in two ways;
o The CHA can issue an Opportunity Notice to all participants in the program
requesting proposals from development teams for a specific property.
o Development Teams can submit proposals at any time for CHA-owned properties
of five acres or less. Upon receipt of a proposal, the CHA issues an Opportunity
Notice to all other program participants requiring any additional proposals to be
submitted within 30 days.
• CHA issued an Opportunity Notice on October 4,2018 to all Pre-Qualified Development
Teams and received seven (7) proposals.
• Pre-Proposal Conference: Monday, October 15, 2018.
• Site Visit Dates: Monday, October 15, 2018 and Friday, October 19, 2018.
• Four (4) developers were within the competitive range and invited for Oral Presentations.
• The evaluation team consisted of staff from Development, CCD, Treasury and Property
Office. There were five (5) scoring members and one technical advisor that evaluated the
proposals and oral presentations.
• The Pennrose-Bickerdike Team scored the highest for their technical proposal and second
highest for their oral presentation.
• The Pennrose-Bickerdike Team provides the highest value as a development partner for
the CHA because of their national experience with RAD project-based voucher
conversions, partners with extensive experience with mixed-income development,
experience joint-venturing with housing authorities, and clear financial underwriting.
• The Pennrose-Bickerdike Team is the recommended pre-qualified development team
member to partner with CHA for development of the Wicker Park site.
