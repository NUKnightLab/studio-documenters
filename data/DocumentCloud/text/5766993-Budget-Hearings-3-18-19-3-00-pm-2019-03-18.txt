Detroit Transportation Corporation (People Mover)
FY 2019-2020 Budget Analysis by the Legislative Policy Division
Summag;
The Detroit Transportation Corporation (DTC) was created by the City of Detroit pursuant to

P.A. 7 of 1967 as a component unit of the city for the basic purpose of acquiring, completing and
operating the Downtown People Mover.

The DTC is governed by a Board of Directors consisting of six members, appointed by the
Mayor without compensation or set terms. The City Council President also sits on the board.

The DTC organization structure includes twelve divisions: Administration, Executive,
Accounting, Field Operations, Homeland, Human Resources, Maintenance, Marketing,
Operations Administration, Quality Control, Safety, and System Operations.

For 2019-2020, the recommended budget proposes an operating subsidy of $6.5 million which is
the same as the prior three years? subsidy.

Issues and Questions

1. What is the current condition of the People Mover?
2. Are there any new capital needs for the system?
3. Please provide a copy of the 2019-2020 budget approved by the Board.

4. In the ?nancial statements for June 30, 2018, it reports that the unrestricted de?cit
position has increased by $500,000 since June 20, 2017. This is to the Administration -
why wouldn?t the subsidy have been increased to cover the de?cit of $800,000? What
steps are being taken to not have that de?cit increase either in this ?scal year or in the
upcoming year?

5. Ticket sales went from $1.4 million in 2017 to $1.16 million in 2018. What were sales in
2016? What is projected for this proposed budget?

6. Please indicate the number of vacancies as of January 31, 2019. Please brie?y describe
the difficulty of ?lling the vacancies. Also, please brie?y explain the department's
strategy to ?ll any vacant positions, or request new positions.

7. Have there been discussions with Municipal Parking as they prepare to rehab and reopen
Joe Louis Parking Garage to alleviate parking downtown. Is that plan expected to
increase ticket or pass sales?

8. Please brie?y explain the department's new expense initiatives, new capital ?mding
requests, operational reform and savings proposals, and new revenue initiatives/proposals
