COMMISSIONERS
PROPOSED ORDINANCES

Submitting a Proposed Ordinance Amendment sponsored by
ROBERTO MALDONADO and JOHN P. DALEY, County Commissioners
Co-Sponsored by
BOBBIE L. STEELE, MIKE QUIGLEY and LARRY SUFFREDIN, County Commissioners
requesting authorization to amend the "Cook County Living Wage Ordinance" (98-0-21), approved by
the Board on September 15, 1998, for your approval. This item will be introduced at the May 18, 2004
Board meeting and I will request that it be referred to the Finance Labor Subcommittee for further review
and discussion.
Similar to the City of Chicago's Living Wage Ordinance (Title 2, Chapter 92, Section 610), the proposed
amendment increases the living wage for lowest-wage individuals employed by contractors or
subcontractors doing business with Cook County. The county's current living wage of $7.60 per hour
will be increased to $9.43 per hour if health benefits are provided, or $10.68 per hour with no health
benefits. There will be an annual adjustment calculated as 100% of the federal poverty line for a family
of four (as defined by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services) with health benefits and 125%
of the federal poverty line for a family of four without health benefits.
In addition, the proposed amendment applies to companies benefiting from property tax incentives as set
forth in the Cook County Real Property Assessment Classification Ordinance.
These amendments will ensure fair wages and will contribute to the county's overall economic wellbeing.
PR POSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT
WHEREAS, on September 15, 1998, the Cook County Board of Commissioners passed the County
Living Wage Ordinance to establish meaningful employee compensation for lowest-wage individuals
employed by a person or business entity awarded a contract or subcontract with Cook County; and
WHEREAS, in recent years, over one hundred (100) local governments in the United States, including
the City of Chicago, have enacted living wage laws with living wage adjustments that reflect changes in
the federal poverty level; and
WHEREAS, the United States Department of Health and Human Services places the 2004 poverty
guideline for a family of four (3 children under the age of 18) at $18,850 and, in order for a worker to
earn an annual income at or above the guideline, a worker would need to be paid a living wage of Nine
and 43/100 Dollars ($9.43) per hour for 2,000 hours per year; and
WHEREAS, Cook County's Living Wage Ordinance should be updated to reflect the most recent federal
poverty level standards to maintain a stable and productive work force thereby stimulating the local
economy; and

1432

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 18, 2004

WHEREAS, companies that benefit from property tax incentives from Cook County should be held to
the same living wage standard as those companies who do business with Cook County to ensure a fair
wage for their employees and to contribute to the County's overall economic well-being; now, therefore,
BE IT ORDAINED BY THE PRESIDENT AND THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF THE
COUNTY OF COOK:

THORN CREEK BASIN SANITARY DISTRICT - NO CASH BID REQUEST

Transmitting a Communication, dated May 12, 2004 from
DEBORAH SIMS, Chairman, Tax Delinquency Subcommittee
Submitting a request from
Kathleen Field Orr & Associates, Attorney
Re:

Cook County No Cash Bid Program Application on behalf of
Thom Creek Basin Sanitary District
Property Identification Numbers: 32-28-303-019, 32-28-304-008 and 32-28-304-003

I serve as Special Counsel to the Thom Creek Basin Sanitary District (the "District") and I am writing to
you on behalf of its Board of Trustees. The District is a duly organized and existing governmental entity
created under the provisions of the Illinois Sanitary District Act of 1917. The District provides sanitary
and waste water services to the City of Chicago Heights, the Village of Crete, the Village of Homewood,
the Village of Park Forest, the Village of Steger and the Village of South Chicago Heights. The District
is authorized by law to levy ad valorem real estate taxes to accomplish its mission.
The District is attempting to obtain title on the Subject Properties in order to complete its Wet Weather
Retention Facility (the "Facility") that will temporarily store water during heavy rainstorms. The EPA
requires construction of wet weather retention facilities to prevent overflow problems into streams and
rivers in adverse weather conditions. The Facility will be built on District property but the Subject
Properties are required to bring underground lines from the Facility to the District's main treatment
facility at 700 West End Avenue.

1475

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 18, 2004
The Facility will benefit several municipalities and citizens of the District by preventing overflow
problems. Preventing pollutants from entering into natural waterways while simultaneously preventing
unnecessary flooding throughout the area will serve to compliment and enhance ongoing redevelopment
efforts within the south suburban region. Acquisition of the Subject Properties is imperative to meet
current environmental standards imposed by the EPA and to acquire available grant funds for the overall
project.
The District is hereby submitting its application to the Cook County No Cash Bid Program, and is
including the following documents for your review.
1.

An original copy of Resolution Number 03-04 adopted by the Board of Trustees of the
Thom Creek Basin Sanitary District requesting a no-cash bid on the Subject Properties by
the County of Cook; and

2.

Resolution Number 2003-08 adopted by the Town of Bloom supporting the submission
of the District's application to the County of Cook; and

3.

A title commitment for each of the Subject Properties; and

4.

A Sidwell Map of the area identifying the Subject Properties; and

5.

Photographs depicting each of the Subject Properties.

As required under the program, the District will provide for legal counsel, will bear all cost associated
with acquisition of the Subject Properties and will meet all necessary reporting requirements.

Commissioner Sims, seconded by Commissioner Hansen, moved that the communication be referred to
the Tax Delinquency Subcommittee. (Comm. No. 265625). The motion carried unanimously.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 18, 2004
Commissioner Suffredin, seconded by Commissioner Quigley, moved Communication No. 263301 for
discussion purposes.
The Secretary clarified that the commissioners would be examining the redlined version of the ordinance,
distributed under a cover memorandum from her office, dated March 25, 2004.
Chairman Daley invited Michael Fogarty, Assistant State's Attorney, to explain the various amendments
suggested by the State's Attorney's office.
ASA Fogarty stated that his first recommended change, to be inserted after the third "Whereas," was to
change the effective date to "November 19, 2003," which was the date of the public act passed by the
General Assembly.
ASA Fogarty's next recommended change was to insert, after the third "Whereas," "State Officials and
Employees Ethics Act, 5 ILCS 430 et seq."
ASA Fogarty's next recommended change, also after the third "Whereas," was to strike "prohibit" and,
comporting with the State Act, to insert "regulate" and before "employees" to insert "certain." He
explained that not all employees are regulated.
Commissioner Hansen asked where the word "prohibit" came from.
ASA Fogarty responded that this word was included in the ordinance as they received it.
ASA Fogarty noted the next amendment, to be inserted after the final "Whereas" paragraph: "NOW,
THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED BY THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF COOK COUNTY,
ILLINOIS THAT THE CODE OF ETHICAL CONDUCT FOR COOK COUNTY IS AMENDED AS
FOLLOWS"
Commissioner Hansen asked whether the Board was ordaining the Ordinance under Home Rule powers.
ASA Fogarty replied "yes, in part." He stated that there is a limitation on Home Rule powers, and that
the Board is required to enact an ordinance which is no less restrictive than parts of the state act which
deal with prohibitive political activities and gift bans. He stated that there are other changes in the
ordinance that do not relate to the state act and that those changes would fall under the Board's normal
powers.
Commissioner Goslin asked whether the state act has mandated all counties to pass ethics ordinances.
ASA Fogarty responded in the affirmative, explaining that all units of government and school districts are
mandated to enact an ethics ordinance or resolution. He clarified that the mandate refers only to two parts
of the state act: prohibition of political activities and the gift ban. He noted that the state act is much
more extensive in that it establishes a system of ethics and ethics investigation.
President Stroger inquired whether the state legislature had the supermajority needed to mandate a home
rule override provision.
ASA Fogarty explained that the first part of the act, effective November 19, was initially vetoed by the
governor and was subsequently passed by a supermajority on a veto override motion.

1493

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 18, 2004

Commissioner Suffredin, referring to the official record of the House, confirmed that in the House and the
Senate, both before the act went to the Governor for the amendatory veto and after, extraordinary
majorities passed the act, by which they met the required Constitutional specifications.
Commissioner Hansen asked whether it was a declared home rule vote or just a vote.
Commissioner Suffredin, citing Senate Bill 702 and House Bill 3412, replied that the Chair recorded the
requirement of an extraordinary majority, and reported that both bills passed with an extraordinary
majority in both Houses.
Commissioner Suffredin asked that the roll call from Public Act 93-617 and Public Act 93-615 be entered
into the record. (The referenced documents are on file with the County Clerk.)
Commissioner Quigley noted the Cook County Ethics Ordinance was introduced before the State Act and
Model Ordinance because it is the right thing to do.
President Stroger noted that under former President Richard Phelan there was an ethics ordinance that
was enacted, and many of the issues being raised today are in that ordinance. He noted further that Cook
County was one of the first counties to enact an ethics ordinance.
Commissioner Hansen noted that there are many different types of ethics ordinances throughout the
country. He further noted that the more complex the ordinance, the more difficult its application
becomes. He noted that he sponsored an ethics code that was passed under former President George
Dunne.
ASA Fogarty referred to the following amendments:
~

"Campaign for elective office" means any activity in furtherance of an effort to influence the
selection, nomination, election, or appointment of any individual to any federal. State. or local public
office or office in a political organization, or the selection, nomination, or election of Presidential or vicePresidential electors, but does not include activities (i) relatine: to the support or opposition of any
executive, legislative, or administrative action, (ii) relating to collective bargaining. or (iii) that are
otherwise in furtherance of the person s official duties.
(e g)
"Candidate" means any person who has filed nominating papers or petitions for nomination or
election to an elected office, or who has been appointed to fill a vacancy in nomination. and who remains
eligible for placement on the ballot at either a general mimary election or general election a deelaration of
eandidaey fer eleeted offiee or f1etition to aJlflea-r on a ballot for eleetion, or who has raised or expended
money in pursuit of elected office.
{fil
' Collective Bargaining' J1as the same meaning a that tennis defined in Section 3 of U1e lllinois
Public Labor Relations Act. (5 ILCS 5/1-3).

ill

' Compensated time" means any ti:m_e worked by or credited to an employee 'that c unts toward
any minimum work time requirement imposed as a condition of employment bu:l does not include ruw
designated holidays or any period when the employee is on a Leave of absence.

(g}
"Compensatory time off' means authorized time off earned by or awarded to an employee to
compensate in whole or in part for time worked in excess of the minimum work time required of that
employee as a condition of employment.

1494

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 18, 2004
(h)
"Contribution" has the same meaning as that term is defined in Section 9-1.4 of the Election
Code. (10 ILCS 5/9-1.4) .
.ill).

'L_eave of absence' means any period during which an employee does not receive (i)
compensation for employment. (ii) service credit towards pension benefits, and (iii) health insurance
benefits paid for by the employer.

tk r)

"Official" means any elected Cook County official or appointed official regardless of whether the
official is compensated or any appointed non-employee member of any agency of Cook County.

Commissioner Murphy asked, regarding "(r)", what the change was.
ASA Fogarty responded that the language "or appointed official regardless of whether the official is
compensated" is taken from the mandate section of the State Act.
Commissioner Silvestri clarified that this language was in the original amendment.
ASA Fogarty replied that the language was taken from the current County Ordinance. He stated that the
State Act describes the word "officer," but it uses the term "executive branch or legislative branch
constitutionally elected officer" which is not applicable to the County. He further stated that in the
section of the State Act that mandates that an ethics ordinance be enacted, it states "officer means ... or
appointed official regardless of whether the official was compensated."
Commissioner Hansen asked whether other local government entities such as park districts and libraries
are omitted.
ASA Fogarty replied in the negative.
Commissioner Hansen asked ASA Fogarty for an example of "non-employee member of any agency of
Cook County."
Jennifer Vidis, Executive Director of the Department of Human Rights, Ethics and Women's Issues, gave
the example of an appointed official to a board or a commission, such as a zoning board.
Commissioner Hansen asked whether "e" corresponds to "collective bargaining."
ASA Fogarty stated that the new definitions receive new numbers, so the new definition "campaign for
elective office" received a "c." He stated that previously, compensation had the letter "e" and it will have
the letter "a."
Vice Chairman Steele asked whether the ordinance will apply to all appointed officers, including the
Women's Commission, Zoning, Housing, and others.
ASA Fogarty replied in the affirmative.
Vice Chairman Steele voiced the concern that all the various bodies be spelled out, so that they are aware
that the ordinance applies to them.
Commissioner Quigley noted that were this approach to be taken, the ordinance would have to be
amended with the creation of every new board and committee.

1495

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 18, 2004

Commissioner Silvestri noted that his reading of the ordinance is that local government bodies have to
enact their own ethics ordinances.
Commissioner Hansen asked whether "appointed" refers to appointed by the President solely or appointed
by the President with approval of the Board.
ASA Fogarty replied that the state act does not make that distinction, and that all appointed officials are
included.
Commissioner Hansen voiced his concern that there should be clarity on this point.
Commissioner Murphy suggested the insertion of the word "any."
ASA Fogarty replied that the word "any" was already present.
Commissioner Hansen asked where "political activity" was taken from .
ASA Fogarty replied that it was taken from the new State Officials and Employees Ethics Act.
ASA Fogarty explained that the current County Ethics Ordinance does have a definition of "political
organization," but that he thought it would be better to adopt the State Act definition and also it would be
better to remove the language that occurs at the end of the current definition that refers to an income tax
deduction.
ASA Fogarty referred to the next change:
Amendment to Article II, Section 2.4(a):
(a)
Gift aaa. Except as otherwise provided in this Ordinance, no GQ.fficial or Bs'.mployee shall
intentionally solicit or accept any Ggift from any PQrohibited S.§.ource or in violation of any federal or
State statute, rule, or regulation, or any Countv ordinance, rule or regulation. This ban applies to and
includes spouses of and immediate family living with the GQfficial or .g~mployee. No PQ_rohibited
S.§.ource shall intentionally offer or make a Ggift that violates this Section.
ASA Fogarty clarified that the gift ban applies not only to the federal and state statutes, rules, or
regulations, but also applies to the County statutes.
Vice Chairman Steele asked ASA Fogarty to elaborate on the gift ban.
ASA Fogarty explained that the language was taken from the State Act. He cited the following:
"Subject to certain exceptions, no official or employee may intentionally solicit or accept any gift from
any prohibited source." He explained that there are six political prohibited sources that are substantially
identical to the current ordinance as prohibited sources of gifts. He further cited "No prohibited source
shall intentionally offer or make a gift that violates this act."
Chairman Daley asked whether golf or tennis outings would be considered gifts.
ASA Fogarty replied that there are certain exceptions that would allow those outings.
Commissioner Hansen asked whether 2.1, 2.2, or 2.3 have any corrections.

1496

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 18, 2004
ASA Fogarty replied in the negative. He noted that the gift ban in 2.4a is subject to exceptions in 2.4b
which are extensive; there are twelve (12) exceptions which are taken verbatim from the State Act.
ASA Fogarty explained that Commissioner Suffredin had several amendments to 2.4(b) .
Ms. Vidis explained that 2.4(b )(ii) and 2.4(b)(?)(iii) have additional language, suggested by
Commissioner Suffredin, clarifying that the exceptions to the gift ban include spouses and immediate
family members living with the employee.
Amendment to Article II, Section 2.4(b )(2):

ill

Anything for which the official or employee or b1s or her spouse or immediate family member
living with him or her pays the market value.

Commissioner Suffredin noted that he obtained this language from the Attorney General's model
ordinance.
ASA Fogarty explained that the next amendment changes the tenn "minor" to "dependent," as used in the
Internal Revenue Code:
Amendment to Article II, Section 2.7:
(a)
No QQ.fficial or ~mployee shall make, or participate in making, any County governmental
decision with respect to any matter in which the Person, the .Person's s1301;1se or minor ehi:ld has any
EeoaotRie official or employee. or the spouse or dependent of the official or employee, has any economic
interest distinguishable from that of the general public. For purposes of this Section 2.7, "dependent"
sbaJl have the same meaning as provided in lbe U.S. Internal Revenue Code, as amended.
ASA Fogarty explained that Section 2.9(b) deals with "revolving door" issues. The Section defines
contract management authority and goes on to specify that any official or employee who had contract
management authority is banned from assisting or representing any other person with respect to that
contract for the duration of that contract. He noted that other employees or officials involved in that
contract are only banned for one year.
Amendment to Article II, Section 2.9(b ):
(b)
No former G.Qfficial or E~mployee shall for a period of one year after the termination of the
QQ.fficial's or E~mployee's term of office or employment assist or represent any P.Qerson in any business
transaction involving the County, if the QQ.fficial or E~mployee participated personally and substantially
in that transaction during his or her term of office or employment; provided, that if the official or
employee exercised contract management authority with respect to a contract this prohibition shall, a to
that contrnot, extend for a period of not less than one year but not longer than the original term of 9e
penlli:l:tleal as to that contract.
Commissioner Hansen asked whether the commissioners fall under the terms "personally" and
"substantially."
ASA Fogarty responded that the Board would have to interpret these terms.
Chairman Daley asked the State's Attorney to create some language to clarify the issue.

1497

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 18, 2004
Commissioner Peraica stated that he thought subcontractors should be included.
ASA Fogarty replied that he thought the terms would apply to subcontractors as well, but that it would be
useful to clarify.
Vice Chairman Steele asked whether officials or employees who worked in a department that had a
specific contract and who terminated employment or whose term of office was complete could not return
to work on that contract for the period of a year.
ASA Fogarty replied in the affirmative.
Chairman Daley asked whether an employee or official could retire and then come back within a year to
work on a new contract.
ASA Fogarty replied in the affirmative.
Commissioner Collins stated the following: the intent is that if you are a County employee or
commissioner, you cannot go to work on a contract at an entity if you have had substantial involvement
with that entity while employed by the County. However, if you have worked on a contract while at the
entity, you are not prohibited for coming to work for the County.
Commissioner Murphy noted that if there were a question of substantial involvement, there would be an
ethics investigation and ruling.
ASA Fogarty clarified that if someone were to come back to work for the County, they could work on any
contract regardless of whether they had prior involvement in that contract.
Vice Chairman Steele asked whether the following is prohibited and, if so, what the County can do about
it: a county employee, who has contract authority, retires from the County and goes to work for a
company that has that contract with the County.
ASA Fogarty explained that the ordinance would apply. He further clarified that an employee who has
contract authority could go to work for another company, but he/she could not use his/her knowledge of
the County in negotiating that contract with the County for the duration of one year.
Vice Chainnan Steele asked whether the contract that the employee had worked on was the only contract
that he was forbidden to work on for a year after severing his employment with the County.
ASA Fogarty replied in the affirmative. He clarified that the employee could go to work for a company
that has contracts with the County, however, he could not use his County knowledge in assisting in the
contract in which he had been involved.
Commissioner Quigley noted that what this ordinance doesn't address is the following: an employee who
has contract management authority negotiates a contract with XYZ firm and then XYZ hires him,
although he doesn't work on the specific contract for the employer that he worked on while employed by
the County.
ASA Fogarty replied that this section of the ordinance does not cover that type of situation.
Commissioner Quigley asked if there were any sections in either the ordinance or the model ordinance
that would cover this situation.

1498

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 18, 2004
ASA Fogarty responded in the negative.
Commissioner Peraica gave his interpretation of this section of the ordinance, asserting that any employee
with contract management authority or who participated in the contract "personally or substantially"
could not then go to work for the company on whose contract he worked.
ASA Fogarty responded that this was an incorrect interpretation of the section of the ordinance. He
explained that the correct reading is that a person cannot assist or represent a contract he has worked on at
the County, but the section does not prohibit that person for working in the company, as long as it is not
on that specific contract.
Commissioner Peraica brought up the possibility that the person concerned could silently provide
information to his colleagues at his private employer and that this would be inappropriate.
ASA Fogarty replied that was a possibility, but that he was unable to consider the issue because it
involved anti-trust issues. He explained that the federal government had language of this type and that,
possibly, the County might be able to develop such language under its Home Rule authority.
President Stroger noted that the Commissioners should not rush through this issue. He also noted that
there should be a court reporter present.
Chairman Daley responded that the tapes would be given to a court reporter and a transcript generated.
Commissioner Butler asked whether an elected official could immediately become a lobbyist, once
his/her term of office was complete.
ASA Fogarty replied in the affinnative, except that they could not work on any contracts that they had
previously worked on.
Commissioner Hansen asserted that line 3, "represent any person in any business transaction involving
the County," limits lobbying efforts.
Chairman Daley agreed, and noted that this issue should be further clarified.
Commissioner Murphy said that the section is very clear that a person can be hired and work on issues
unrelated to what he worked on as a County employee. She noted that it would be punishing to interpret
the ordinance differently, and that expertise would be lost. She noted that advisory opinions can be
obtained from the Ethics Department.
Commissioner Collins asked whether the language was taken from the state act.
ASA Fogarty replied in the negative, and clarified that this language was created by the County.
Commissioner Collins stated that this language originated at the state level and was intended to prevent
pay-offs in the form of high-paying jobs.
Commissioner Hansen asked for clarification of the language discrepancy between the memo and the blue
booklet.

1499

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 18, 2004

Ms. Vidis replied the following: the blue book is the existing ordinance, and on January 6, 2004 the
Board sent a version of the ordinance containing proposed revisions to this Committee, in the form of
Item #263301. The matter now before this Committee is a series of further revisions to #263301. In
other words, amendments to the proposed amendment.
Commissioner Hansen clarified that the only codified ordinance is the blue book.
Ms. Vidis stated that the numbering of the amendments does not necessarily correspond to the numbering
system in the blue book. This will be corrected as the changes to the ordinance are prepared in a final
draft.
ASA Fogarty noted that the next change occurred in Section 2.15.
Amendment to Article II, Section 2.15:

W

County funds and re ouroes may not be used by any elected County official to print or pay for tbe
printing of any newsletters or brochures during the peri d beginning ebnmy 1 of the year of a general
primary election and ending U1e day after such general primary election and during a period beginning
Sept.ember 1 of the year of a general election and ending the day after such general electi n if the elected
County official is a candidate in such general primary or general election. A County elected official may
not maj], during the period beginning February I of the year of a general primary election and ending the
day after such general primary election and during a period beginning September I of the year of a
general election and ending the day after such general election. any newsletters or brochures that were
printed at any time using ounty funds or resources if the elected County official is a candidate in such
general primary or general election.

ill

This Section shall not apply to any informational brochures or newsletters that are solely related
to and accompany any mailing of a property tax bill, notice of property tax assessment, or notice of voter
registration or polling place information, or to a nev;sletter or brochure mailed to a constituent in response
that constituent' inquiry concernjng the needs of that constituent or guesti.ons raised by thal con tituenl.

Ms. Vidis explained that the limitation on printing before an election only applies to those officials that
are running for re-election. She explained that the section is a general prohibition against using county
funds six to eight weeks before an election. She noted that it is similar to the Congressional Franking
Prohibitions. She explained that this prohibition does not pertain to documents such as polling place
notices, or notice of tax reassessment.
Chairman Daley asked whether a candidate's name would have to be removed from government property
and documents.
Commissioner Murphy pointed out the enormous amount of re-printing that would have to be done were
this the case.
Commissioner Hansen pointed out that certain public officials have their names on the windows as well.
Chairman Daley explained that the state offered an amendment that prohibited candidates from appearing
on television through public funding.
Vice Chairman Steele noted that certain elected officials have brochures at the information desk
downstairs. She asked whether this would be considered illegal during an election cycle.

1500

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 18, 2004
Commissioner Silvestri noted that the brochures are acceptable, as long as the candidate's name isn't
included.
Commissioner Butler referenced Section 2.56 on page 14, noting "no official or employee shall engage in
or permit the unauthorized use of county-owned or county-leased property." From this he inferred that
using county property to distribute brochures would be prohibited.
Ms. Vidis explained that Section 2.15 would limit county funds and resources to print and mail
newsletters and brochures for a certain time before an election. She further explained that the section
does not address using an image, or using a name, or an ethnic festival or a reception.
Commissioner Peraica voiced his concern that if an elected official used his own funds to plan an event,
and then used county property to host the event, this would be inappropriate.
Ms. Vidis replied that the Ethics Commission would have to examine that in a case-by-case basis,
examining the details of the event and whether it was official business or not.
President Stroger voiced his opinion that it is ludicrous to think that the assessor should take his name off
of all the literature he has accumulated, or that the treasurer should take her name off the tax bills, which
go out the same time as the election. President Stroger made the distinction of electioneering. He noted
that receptions held throughout the year to educate people about County government were vital and not,
in his opinion, electioneering.
Commissioner Murphy voiced the concern that constitutional officers do not come under this ordinance.
ASA Fogarty clarified that those officials whose offices are considered state functions are not governed
by the Ethics Ordinance, namely the State's Attorney, the Clerk of the Circuit Court, and the Chief Judge
of the Circuit Court.
Commissioner Murphy added that it is still being determined whether the Board of Review is governed
by the Ethics Ordinance. She noted that these entities have an advantage over those entities ruled by the
Ethics Ordinance.
Commissioner Silvestri explained that these governmental entities are restricted under state law and
therefore do not enjoy any advantage.
Commissioner Suffredin clarified that the new state law will come to bear on the next election process.
Commissioner Butler voiced the concern that under the ordinance, relations of the president would
unfairly be banned from employment eligibility. He voiced the concern that the commissioners were
interpreting the letter, not the spirit, of the law.
President Stroger noted that the ordinance had to be interpreted with constitutionality in mind.
Commissioner Silvestri asked what happens if the relative is employed by the County before the County
official is elected.
Commissioner Butler replied that the employee would be grandfathered in.
Ms. Vidis referred to the following:

1501

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 18, 2004

Amendment to Article II, Section 2.16(a):
.(fil
Each elected official. members of ea.ch elected official's personal staff and each emp loyee
holding a senior executive service position with the Cow1tv. upon due notice, shall attend an ethics
education seminar offered on a regula1· basis by the Board of Ethics within t20 days of the effective. date
of this amendatory ordinance or within 120 days of becoming an elected official, becoming a member of
an elected official s personal staff, or holding a senior executive service position with U1e Countv (or as
soon thereafter as an ethics education seminar is offered by the Board of Ethics) and every four years
thereafter. The seminar shall educate person as to their duties and responsibilities under this Ordinance.
Any elected official or emp loyee covered by this Section who fails to comply with this Section shall he
subject to a $500 fine.

Ms. Vidis noted that additional language was added to address Commissioner Hansen's concerns, namely
that any employee required to do Ethics training is given due notice.
Commissioner Hansen asked if this notice would be given by mail.
Ms. Vidis responded yes, and that her office has the capability to contact by e-mail also.
President Stroger noted that Ms. Vidis' office, in conjunction with the President, would develop a
program for the training of new employees.
Chairman Daley noted that the Ordinance is at the current time a working document.
Commissioner Hansen drew attention to the last sentence of the Section, and suggested that perhaps
appropriate disciplinary action would be preferable to fining employees. He also noted that the Section
appeared to apply to only the employees under the President. He asked to hear from the President on this
matter.
President Stroger asked Ms. Vidis for the reasoning behind the sentence.
Ms. Vidis replied that the fine exists in other jurisdictions. She cited, as a model, that under state law, if
an economic disclosures filing is not made, a fine is imposed. She also cited the fact that the City of
Chicago mandates its ethics education and has a fine in place. She noted that it is a common provision
under Ethics Ordinances.
Commissioner Hansen asked whether they had considered every type of language possible. He voiced
concern that this section only applies to employees under the President.
Ms. Vidis clarified that the section applies to every employee under the ordinance in general, including
everyone except the State's Attorney, the Clerk of the Circuit Court, and the Office of the Chief Judge.
She suggested that it could be a recommendation of the public official that the employee be disciplined
instead of fined.
Chairman Daley agreed with Commissioner Hansen's request that this language be looked at further.
Chairman Daley reiterated that a vote would not be taken today. He suggested that the Commissioners
address their concerns by drafting amendments and working with the State's Attorney's Office. He noted
that the Ethics Ordinance had to be adopted by May 18 to comply with the state act. In reply to
Commissioner Hansen's request, Chairman Daley agreed to request a memo from the State's Attorney's
Office for additional clarification.

1502

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 18, 2004
Ms. Vidis referenced the following:
Amendment to Article IV, Section 4.l(b):
(b)
Each member of the Board shall (i) reside within the corporate boundaries of the County; (ii) not
be an B~mployee of the County or any agency thereof; (iii) not hold elected public or political party office
within the County; (iv) have no Fflnancial interest in any work or business of or official action by the
County; (v) not take an active part in managing the political campaign of a candidate for County office;
and (vi) not be convicted of any felony or any crime involving moral turpitude; (vii) not be engaged in
activities that require registration under the Cook County Lobbyist Registration Ordinance; and (viii) not
be related. either by blood or by marriage up to the degree of first cousin, to any elected official of Cook
County.
·
Ms. Vidis explained that this amendment specifies who may be appointed to the Board of Ethics. She
explained that the amendment adds two conditions to appointment to the Board of Ethics: No one who is
a lobbyist may be appointed, nor may anyone be related to any elected official of Cook County by blood
or marriage up to the degree of first cousin. She explained that this was modeled on language from the
state act.
Commissioner Hansen had a question on Article III, regarding "financial disclosure." He referenced the
statement: "All statements shall be available in electronic form." He asked whether the employee had to
file electronically, or whether the County Clerk would make the filing available in an electronic form to
the state.
Ms. Vidis replied that the latter was correct.
Commissioner Hansen referenced Section 2.78 "Conflicts of Interest." He asked whether "governmental"
should be replaced by "County."
ASA Fogarty suggested that "County" be placed in front of "governmental."
Chairman Daley reiterated ASA Fogarty would submit a memo on the various questions raised, and a
copy would be provided to all members.
Chairman Daley recessed the meeting to the Call of the Chair.

May4, 2004
Pursuant to notice, your Committee on Finance of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County

After calling the meeting to order, Chairman Daley referred to a previously distributed list of proposed
amendments to Communication No. 263301. He noted that the amendments were numbered in sequence
from one to twenty-one, and suggested that each proposed amendment be considered individually.

1514

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 18, 2004
AMENDMENT #18
Sponsored by: Mike Quigley, Commissioner
Purpose of Amendment:

Amendment # 18 allows the Executive Director of the Ethics Board to initiate complaints of violations of
the Ethics Ordinance. A prior amendment from our office allowed the Board to initiate complaints. After
consultation with the State's Attorney's Office, we have revised this to apply to the Executive Director
rather than the Board.
Amendment to Article IV ("Board of Ethics"), Section 4.l(f):
(f)

The Board shall conduct hearings, if necessary, and ru.le upon matters brought before it by tlJe
executive director. The executive director shall receive and initiate complaints of violations of
the Ordinance. The executive director shall conduct investigations and shall present the findings
of such investigations for such action as the Board determines is appropriate. The Board's
authority to investigate an alleged violation of this Ordinance is limited to violations which
occurred not more than two (2) years prior to the date upon which a complaint is received or
discovery of the fact that an alleged violation has occurred.

Commissioner Quigley stated that Amendment 18 allows the Executive Director of the Ethics Board to
initiate complaints of violations of the Ethics Ordinance. He stated that a prior amendment of his office
allowed the Board to initiate these complaints. He stated that this amendment had been the law until it
was changed in 1999.
President Stroger asked whether this Amendment had been distributed earlier.
Commissioner Quigley replied that the Amendment was part of the original ordinance previously
introduced, and was part of Amendments introduced earlier.
Chairman Daley noted that it was offered as a previous Amendment in discussion.
Commissioner Quigley, seconded by Commissioner Murphy, moved approval of Amendment #18.
The motion carried.

AMENDMENT #19
Sponsored by: Mike Quigley, Commissioner
Purpose of Amendment:

Amendment #19 makes a technical change to the requirement that elected officials and senior level
employees attend ethics education seminars on a regular basis. Rather than apply the rule to "senior
executive" employees, the rule will apply to "senior administrative service positions." This is a change
made in consultation with the County Human Resources Department. The amendment also requires that
the County give notice to employees of their obligation to attend the Ethics Education training seminars.
Finally, the amendment also removes the fine provision, as it is already included in the current Article V
"Sanctions for Violation."

1515

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 18, 2004

Amendment to Article II ("Code of Conduct"), Section 2.16(a) and (b), Ethics Education Seminar:

W

Each elected official, members of each elected official's personal staff, and each employee
holding a senior eJ(eeutive administrative service position with the County, upon due notice, shall
attend an ethics education seminar offered on a regular basis by the Board of Ethics within 120
days of the effective date of this amendatory ordinance or within 120 days of becoming an elected
official, becoming a member of an elected official's personal staff, or holding a senior eJ(eel:lti·;e
administrative service position with the County (or as soon thereafter as an ethics education
seminar is offered by the Board of Ethics) and every four years thereafter. The seminar shall
educate persons as to their duties and responsibilities under this Ordinance. Afly eleetee offieial
er-efflPloyee eovereEI by tbis Seetioe v..-ho fails to comply with this Section shall be subjeet t:e--ft
$500 fine.

(b)

The Board of Ethics shall define "senior eKeeutive administrative service employee" position" by
rule.

Commissioner Murphy asked whether senior executives are included.
Ms. Vidis replied that this is a language change using the word "administrative" instead of "executive."
She stated that there are legal problems with using the word "executive" because it invokes certain things
under state and federal law. There would be more flexibility with the term "administrative."
President Stroger voiced concern that this Amendment would be unenforceable with regard to other
constitutional officers.
Commissioner Quigley asked whether this Ordinance should only apply to those employees under the
Board's jurisdiction.
President Stroger replied in the negative.
Commissioner Collins asked when an Ethics Ordinance is passed, should it apply to anyone who works
for any county office?
President Stroger replied in the negative.
individual constitutional officers.

He stated that legal enforceability is the province of the

Commissioner Collins asked if all employees are covered.
ASA Fogarty replied that the employees are covered, however, ifthe elected head of the department does
not want to comply with the ordinance there is a question of enforceability.
Commissioner Collins asked whether an elected official has the power to supersede any County law.
ASA Fogarty replied in the affirmative with respect to the State's Attorney, the Chief Judge, and the
Clerk of the Circuit Court, as these are state offices. He stated that they and their employees are not
covered by County ordinance. He stated that other County officials, such as the Assessor, Treasurer and
the County Clerk also have the right to control their own offices to some degree.
Commissioner Silvestri asked whether ASA Fogarty's opinion was based on court cases.

1516

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 18, 2004
ASA Fogarty replied in the affirmative, and that his recommendation was also based on the opinions of
the Illinois Attorney General. He stated that the County Board has the right to decide the overall budget
of certain offices such as the State's Attorney, but cannot mandate how the office functions.
Commissioner Silvestri asked whether there have been any cases where budgets have been withheld
because the elected officials refuse to comply with county ordinances.
ASA Fogarty stated that he did not know the answer to his inquiry.
Commissioner Maldonado relayed the situation where the former Circuit Clerk several years ago spent
$300,000 in unauthorized funds and that the matter was taken to court and she lost. Commissioner
Maldonado asked ASA Fogarty to comment on this.
ASA Fogarty stated that he could not comment because he was not part of that case.
President Stroger stated that there are courts that find in favor of such spending.
Commissioner Maldonado clarified that the Clerk had violated the procurement ordinance.
President Stroger noted that he can only deal with the financial aspects of contracts, not conditions.
Commissioner Collins stated that the President should not try to dictate the content of those contracts;
those contracts are up to the President to negotiate.
President Stroger stated that he cannot tell the Sheriff how to use his personnel. He noted, as an example,
that certain categories in the Sheriffs Office should earn as much as the Sheriffs Police, but that the
cases have been lost before arbitrators because the Sheriff claims that the police have extra duties.
Commissioner Silvestri asked what is the difference between Amendments 14 and 19. He noted that one
says "administrative" and one says "senior executive," and that both amendments refer to "elected
officials."
Ms. Vidis replied that Amendment 19 makes some additional changes to Amendment 14.
Commissioner Peraica asked ifthere is a fine for violations.
ASA Fogarty replied that a fine can be levied up to $500 for any violation, and there is a provision in the
penalty section which provides that a violation of the ordinance can result in employment discipline up to
discharge. He stated that this language was redundant based on the previous section.
Commissioner Butler asked upon whom the fine would be enforced, and whether enforcement would be
through the courts.
ASA Fogarty replied that the Board of Ethics would use its discretion to do what is right, but that it might
require court action.
Commissioner Butler emphasized that enforcement would require the court's intervention.
ASA Fogarty concurred.

1517

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 18, 2004
Commissioner Silvestri asked whether the removal of the specific penalty is the only difference between
Amendment 14 and the revised Amendment 19.
ASA Fogarty replied that the revised Amendment 14 takes out the specific language that levied a
mandatory $500 fine, while Amendment 19 does not address the matter of fines at all. Thus, passing both
amendments presents no conflict and will remove the fine provision.
Commissioner Murphy suggested entering into an intergovernmental agreement with elected officials that
requires them to abide by the Ethics Ordinance.
Chairman Daley said this could be offered to the elected officials and they could opt out if they chose to.
Commissioner Murphy asked whether the state act requires elected officials to undergo ethics training.
ASA Fogarty replied in the affirmative.
Commissioner Murphy stated that since the ethics training comports with state requirements, it should be
kept in.
ASA Fogarty noted that the state act only covers prohibitive political activity and a gift ban; it does not
mandate ordinances requiring ethics training.
Commissioner Quigley responded that the Ethics Ordinance is about creating public trust, and that, as
such, the County should be careful not to create too many exceptions.
President Stroger noted that while he is in favor of the Ethics Ordinance, he has questions about this
particular provision; he does not see how the provision can be enforced.
Commissioner Quigley, seconded by Commissioner Gorman, moved approval of Amendment #19.
The motion carried. President Stroger voted present and Commissioner Butler voted no.

AMENDMENT #20
Sponsored by Mike Quigley, Commissioner
Purpose of Amendment:
Amendment #20 is a "revolving-door" prohibition that states that if a County employee participates in the
decision to award a particular company more than $25,000 in contracts during their final year as a County
employee, they cannot go to work for that company for a year after they leave County employment. It
also prohibits former County employees and officials from ever assisting in business transactions that
they worked on when they worked for the County. It is modeled after language from the new State Ethics
law.

No former official or employee may, for a period of one year after the termination of his or her

substantially in the decision to award Cou nty confracts with a cumulative value of over $25,000
to the person or entity, or its parent or subsidiary.

@

This Section applies only to persons who terminate an affected position on or after the effective
date of this Ordinance.

Commissioner Peraica asked whether subcontractors are covered under this Amendment.
ASA Fogarty said no, not in all cases; if, however, the employer owns the tools and runs the workplace,
and dictates the method of working, then the answer is yes.
Commissioner Peraica asked if this is because of the definition of employee.
ASA Fogarty replied in the affirmative, and noted that the words "or entity controlled by the employer"
could be added, in the third line of paragraph c.
Commissioner Quigley, seconded by Commissioner Peraica, moved to amend Amendment #20 by
adding the following language: " ... compensation or fees for services from an employer or any
entity controlled by the employer if the employee ... ".

1519

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 18, 2004
Commissioner Murphy noted that certain subcontractors are very far removed from the parent company,
and this amendment is too restrictive. She noted that each person would have to come before the Board to
petition and that this would be prohibitive.
Commissioner Collins stated that she believed that the cumulative value of $25,000, as found in 2.9(c)
should be raised.
Commissioner Quigley noted that the state's penalty is $25,000.

Commissioner Collins, seconded by Commissioner Murphy, moved to amend Amendment #20 by
raising the threshold of the cumulative value from $25,000 to $50,000. The motion to amend
Amendment #20 failed.
Commissioner Quigley, seconded by Commissioner Peraica, moved approval of Amendment #20.
The motion carried. Commissioner Butler voted no.

AMENDMENT #21
Sponsored by: John P. Daley and Forrest Claypool, Commissioners
Purpose of Amendment:
This amendment was drafted to provide consistency with the state act, which contains a similar waiver
clause as stated below.

Amendment to Article II, Section 2.910:
@

The requirements of this Section may be waived by the Board of Ethics if the Board of Ethics
finds in wiiting that the County's negotiations and decisions regarding the procurement of the
contract or cotmacts were not materially affected by any potential for employment of that official
or employee by the employer.

This Section applies only to persons who terminate an affected position on or after the effective
date of this Ordinance.

COMMISSIONER HANSEN, SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER PERAICA, MOVED TO
RECEIVE AND FILE COMMUNICATION NUMBER 259134. THE MOTION CARRIED.

SECTION 11
Your Committee has considered, for informational purposes, the Fiscal Year 2004 1st Quarter
Appropriation Trial Balance of the County of Cook, as submitted by the Bureau of Finance.
Chairman Daley called upon Walter K. Knorr, County Comptroller, for an overview of the first quarter.
Mr. Knorr stated that expenditures and cash disbursements are measured against appropriations, and as
such, Corporate Fund expenditures are 22 percent, Public Safety Fund expenditures are at 22.25 percent,
and Health Fund expenditures are at 25 percent.
In resp·onse to an inquiry by Commissioner Hansen, Mr. Knorr explained that a summary of the
Appropriation Trial Balance for all major accounts is included at the beginning of the book.
President Stroger noted that the Appropriation Trial Balance for the period ending February 29, 2004 is
not totally reflective of the first quarter due to the hiring freeze during that same period. He further
commented that the personnel hiring freeze is released, and hiring should begin as needed.
In response to Vice Chairman Steele's comments regarding timely payment of invoices, Mr. Knorr
responded there is a constant flow of bills being processed with deliberate speed. Chairman Daley
remarked that in cases where a backlog exists, it may be due to processing delays at the department level.

SECTION 12
Your Committee has considered the highway bills submitted by the Superintendent of Highways for
approval and payment.
Your Committee, after considering said bills, recommends that they be, and by the adoption of this report,
are approved.

Re:

HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME Program)

respectfully request approval of two (2) HOME Investment Partnerships Program Loans in an
amount not to exceed $300,000.00. The loans will be made to Aspire of Illinois, a nonprofit
special needs' housing provider. Aspire of Illinois will acquire two properties which would
serve as Community Living Projects (CLPs) also referred to as group homes. The properties
to be acquired will be located in the Wes tern Planning region of Cook County and are
projected to house a total of 14 disabled individuals, all of whom are very low income. The
total development cost for the two properties is estimated at $670,000.00 which includes
acquisition and related soft costs. In addition to the HOME funds, other funding includes
first mortgage financing from MidAmerica Bank and downpayment assistance from the
Federal Home Loan Banks of Chicago.
The HOME Program loans will be structured over 40 years and will be fully amortized at 1%
interest. The County Home Program will receive monthly principal and interest payments
from both loans of approximately $758.57 with annual payments projected at $9,102.84
which will be used for other HOME eligible activities.
I respectfully request approval of this project, and that the Chief Administrative Officer of the
County of Cook, or his designee, be authorized to execute on behalf of the County of Cook,
any and all documents necessary to further the project approved herein, including but not
limited to the HOME Loan agreement and any modifications thereto. These loans will be
closed with assistance of the State's Attorney's Office, which assistance will include that
office drafting the County's loan documents. The approval of this loan by this Honorable
Body will permit staff to issue necessary commitments to allow this project to move forward.
Fiscal Impact: None. Grant Funds: $300,000.00. (772-292 Account).
*Referred to the Committee on Business and Economic Development on 5/4/04.

Re:

HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME Program)

respectfully request approval of a HOME Investment Partnerships Program grant to be used
for the rehabilitation of approximately 18 single-family homes for low-and very-low income
households in the following municipalities: Barrington, Bartlett, Buffalo Grove, Elk Grove
Village, Elmwood Park, Glenview, Hanover Park, Hoffman Estates, Morton Grove, Niles,
Park Ridge, Prospect Heights, Rolling Meadows and Wilmette. The project complies with
the HOME Program regulations and furthers the goals of the Five-Year Consolidated
Community Development Plan (approved by U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development on October 17, 2000).

1580

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 18, 2004
The HOME Program grant of $750,000.00 will be made between Northwest Housing
Partnership (NWHP) and the County of Cook. NWHP has previously been a successful
participant with HOME Program and CDBG funds. Approval of this loan will enable NWHP
to continue their owner-occupied single-family Rehabilitation Program. Permanent liens are
placed on the properties for the amount of the rehabilitation by Northwest Housing
Partnership. After rehabilitation is completed, NWHP then assigns the Note, Owner's
Partnership Agreement, and Junior Mortgage to Cook County. The Cook County HOME
Program will recapture funds expended on the projects when these homes are sold,
transferred, or otherwise alienated and title is transferred.
I respectfully request approval of this project, and that the Chief Administrative Officer of the
County of Cook, or his designee, be authorized to execute on behalf of the County of Cook,
any and all documents necessary to further the project approved herein, including, but not
limited to the Subgrantee Agreement and any modifications thereto. The necessary
documents will be reviewed and approved by the State's Attorney's Office. Approval of this
grant by this Honorable Body will permit staff to move forward with this project.
Fiscal Impact: None. Grant Funds: $750,000.00. (772-298 Account).

asthma and is especially harmful to vulnerable groups such as children, the elderly and for people with

of air pollution in our state, emitting smog-forming nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide which contribute to
