Re: TWW Employment Solutions Corp Detroit Employment Solutions Corp and
City of Detroit, No 18-009704-CK (the ?Lawsuit?) proposed settlement

BACKGROUND

Prior to the City?s bankruptcy ?ling, TWW Employment Solutions, LLC and the City entered into
a one year contract, with options to extend at the City's election. TWW was engaged to provide
services in connection with the City?s job training efforts.

In June 2012, before the conclusion of its one year term, the City gave notice to TWW that the
contract would be wound down early and not extended further. The federal funds supporting the
contract were then re-programmed elsewhere. After taking these actions, the City retained Detroit
Employment Solutions Corporation (DESC) to act as its Fiscal Agent in the administration of all
of its federal workforce development funding. The Governance Agreement between the City and
DESC includes mutual indemnities. The wind?down of the TWW contract was one of the legacy
projects DESC took over for the City. DESC continues to provide those services to the City and
uses federal funding to pay the salaries of the employees providing job training services for the
City.

TWW sued the City and DESC for breach of contract and quantum meruit. TWW alleges that it
continued to provide services after the notice of termination and after the bankruptcy. The City
was released from the action because TWW did not ?le a claim against the City in the City's
bankruptcy. DESC continued in the action on its own. Against TWW's demands for several
hundred thousand dollars, a case evaluation panel awarded $15,000 to TWW against DESC.

At a recent settlement conference held in advance of oral argument on DESC's pending motion for
summary disposition, Hon. Brian Sullivan facilitated an agreement calling for DESC to pay
$30,000 in exchange for a release and a non-disclosure agreement. Because of its very limited
discretionary funding, counsel contacted the City?s counsel to see if the City would
contribute to the settlement.

Due to DESC's near total reliance on restricted federal funding, it has very limited access to
discretionary funds which would be available to meet the $30,000 legacy obligation. Further,
DESC has a potential contractual indemnity claim against the City under the Governance
Agreement.

Rather than engage in litigation with DESC, the Law Department recommends that the
City contribute $20,000 toward the TWW-DESC settlement, with DESC paying the remaining
$10,000. We believe that is a good resolution of this matter.

If approved, the City would issue a $20,000 payment to DESC and its counsel. The
payment will not issue until execution of a settlement agreement between TWW and DESC and
provision of a fully executed copy to the City. The agreement will provide a full release of the
City and its current and former employees and agents.

RECOMMENDATION

The Law Department recommends that the Hon City Council adopt a resolution which
authorizes payment of $20,000 to ?Detroit Employment Solutions Corporation and John M. Allen,
its attorney,? to be delivered in exchange for a release in favor of the City from TWW Employment
Solutions Corporation. The payment should be mailed to:
