Commissioner Harris then presented a Motion for the approval of the resolution for Item 5:
(Item 5)
In March 2013, the CHA advertised a Request for Proposal (RFP) to provide workforce development
services to CHA residents. The RFP was advertised in area newspapers and on the CHA website. Of
the 11 respondents received, the evaluation committee recommended award of contract to Centers for
New Horizons, Community Assistance Programs and Employment and Employer Services. CHA’s
Resident Services Division is charged with helping families move along the path to self-sufficiency. In
particular, a key deliverable in Plan Forward: Communities that Work is to help at least 6,000 adults
find new or better jobs by 2015. To accomplish this goal, CHA requires specialized workforce
development services. Transitional Jobs (TJ) and On-the-Job Training (OJT) programs are evidencebased programs that lead to sustained unsubsidized employment. The TJ model is designed to address
the employment needs of individuals who possess little or no work history. TJ programs are
intentionally designed to provide job experience to participants who lack the skills needed to
successfully attach to the workforce. TJ has distinct differences from other jobs programs, including
supportive services, a literacy component, subsidized work experience, support during transition to
unsubsidized employment and retention support after job placement. The subsidized job period
typically lasts between six and ten weeks, and wages are paid by CHA’s workforce provider. The
ultimate goal of TJ is to transition workers into unsubsidized positions. The OJT model is designed to
address the needs of individuals who have more basic employment skills, some (but not steady) work
history and the potential to gain specific industry experience. Participants in OJT also receive job
readiness training; however it is customized to industries based on the needs of specific employers that
have committed to hire participants. The subsidized wages are paid directly by the employer, and up
to 50% of the cost is reimbursed by CHA’s workforce provider. All three agencies have existing
relationships with employers and will focus on high growth industries. Providers will be distributed
regionally based on resident need.
RESOLUTION NO. 2013-CHA-62
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated August 14, 2013
entitled “AUTHORIZATION TO ENTER INTO CONTRACTS WITH CENTERS
FOR NEW HORIZONS, COMMUNITY ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS AND
EMPLOYMENT AND EMPLOYERS SERVICES TO PROVIDE WORKFORCE
DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS TO CHA RESIDENTS”;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY

 THAT

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to
enter into contracts with Centers for New Horizons, Inc., Employment and Employer
Services, Inc., and Community Assistance Programs to provide workforce development
services to a total of 400 CHA residents per year for a base period of two years with two
one-year options in an aggregate amount not to exceed $4,587,408 for the base term.
This award is subject to the Contractor’s compliance with the CHA’s MBE/WBE/DBE,
Section 3 resident hiring, and insurance requirements.

(Item 6 - Deferred)

(Item 8)
In May 2013, CHA solicited General Contractors to provide construction services for the
modernization and life safety upgrades at Lincoln Perry Apartments and Annex. The City of Chicago
Code requires Life Safety building systems to be code compliant by the end of December 2014. In
addition, concerns with plumbing mechanical risers have prompted the need to replace these systems
as they are close to the end of their useful life expectancy. Accordingly, an Invitation for Bid was
advertised in May 2013 in area newspapers and on CHA’s website. Notification was sent to the 866
vendors on CHA’s vendor list and 66 Assist Agencies. Of the six bids received, the low bidder was
Novak Construction Company. Novak Construction is a national general contractor and construction
management firm based in Chicago. Their renovation experience includes government facilities,
5

Section 3 Business Concern requirements for this project.
