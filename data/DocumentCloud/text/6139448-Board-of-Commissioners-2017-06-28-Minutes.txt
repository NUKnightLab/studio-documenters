PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT
AN AMENDMENT TO THE COOK COUNTY MEDICAL EXAMINER’S ORDINANCE
BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners, that Chapter 38 Health and Human
Services, Division 1, Sec. 38-113 through Sec. 38-144 of the Cook County Code, is hereby amended as
follows:
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY
***

Sec. 38-113. - Duties.
The Medical Examiner has and shall exercise the powers, duties, responsibilities, functions and
authority provided by ordinance for those purposes and functions. Any abuse by the Medical Examiner of

15

 the authority contained in this ordinance [article] shall be deemed cause for removal.
***
Sec. 38-132. - Identified body; public disposition.
Where the Medical Examiner has no legal reason for retaining a body and an authorized person
cannot or will not assume responsibility for final disposition of the decedent within 30 days of the death
of the decedent, the Medical Examiner shall have the authority to dispose of the body by public
disposition. Notwithstanding the above, where the decedent's next of kin objects to public disposition by
donation to science prior to transfer of the body, the Medical Examiner's Office shall have the authority
to dispose of the body by cremation. Disposition of fetal remains may be by burial when available or by
cremation.
***
Sec. 38-136. - Permission to embalm.
In the interest of public health and hygiene and the preservation of the dignity of the deceased, anybody
any body that is stored in the facility more than three days after death may be embalmed at the discretion
of the Medical Examiner without the permission of the deceased person's next-of-kin.
***
Sec. 38-139. - Permit required for cremation.
(a) Where the remains of any dead human body are to be cremated, thus becoming unavailable for
later examination, it shall be the duty of the funeral director or person having custody of the dead human
body to obtain from the Medical Examiner a Ppermit to Ccremate.
(b) The Medical Examiner may deny a Ppermit to Ccremate, if it is necessary to preserve the body
for law enforcement purposes.
(c) The Medical Examiner's Ppermit shall be presented to the local registrar in applying for the permit
for disposition of a dead human body provided for in 410 ILCS 535/21 of the "Vital Records Act," as
heretofore or hereafter amended.
(d) No crematory shall cremate a dead human body unless a permit for disposition of a dead human
body with an attached Medical Examiner's Ppermit to Ccremate has been furnished to authorize the
cremation.
***
Sec. 38-144. - Fees.
The Medical Examiner shall charge the following fees with the amounts as set in Section 32-1 of this
Code.
(1) Autopsy report.

16

 (2) Toxicology report.
(3) Miscellaneous reports, including artist's drawings, but not including police reports.
(4) Permit to Ccremate a dead human body obtained from the Office of the Medical Examiner, by
facsimile or electronic filing, unless the Medical Examiner determines that the decedent and the
authorized person is indigent and unable to pay the permit fee, or other special circumstances
warrant fee waiver in the Medical Examiner's discretion.
(5) Return fee. The return fee is charged to funeral homes that pick up bodies from the Medical
Examiner's Office and then request to return them to the Office after determining that the family
has no funds for burial. This cost would include the cost of the burial shell and the burial cost.
(6) Death certificate amendment fee. Fee is charged if the amendment is made later than one year of
the person's death (due to a return by Ffuneral Hhome). The Office of the Medical Examiner is
charged by the Illinois Department of Vital Records for amendments made to a death certificate
after one year of the death.
(7) Storage fee. This fee covers bodies returned (by funeral homes) to the Office of the Medical
Examiner for storage while families secure funds for burial services and bodies brought to the
Medical Examiner's Office from hospice, nursing homes, and hospitals for cases not falling under
Medical Examiner jurisdiction as defined in Section 38-118. The ability to accept cases for storage
will be at the discretion of the Medical Examiner and will depend on the current and anticipated
morgue census. This "storage fee" discourages the use of the Office of the Medical Examiner as a
storage location for non-Medical Examiner cases or cases that have been discharged from the
Medical Examiner's Office to funeral homes and encourages funeral directors to verify that
families have funds for burial prior to removing a body from the Office of the Medical Examiner.
In the cases of funeral homes, this "storage fee" would replace the "return fee" if a funeral home
returns a body and picks it up again within ten days. If the body being stored is not picked up
within ten days from the date of storage, the body will be disposed of in accordance with Sec. 38132. held and buried by the County according to the standard operating procedures of the Medical
Examiner
(8) Photographs, radiographs, and histology slides.
(9) Charge to non-County owned hospitals for the acceptance of fetal remains not falling under the
jurisdiction of the Medical Examiner.
(10) Confirmation of death letter.
(11) Tissue procurement morgue use fee. Fee charged to a certified facility or program seeking to
procure tissue from bodies located at the Medical Examiner's Office. The fee covers tissue
procurement per body by a tissue procurement facility or program authorized by the Medical
Examiner.
(12) Student and resident rotation fee. Fee charged to institutions outside of Cook County providing
student and resident rotations at the Medical Examiner's Office to offset the County's costs for
disposable supplies as well as the staff time supervising the rotation.
(13) Staff supervision of external experts. Fee charged to individuals requesting to review slides,

17

 images and/or records at the Medical Examiner's Office to offset staff costs for supervising such
review.
(14) Toxicology send-out fees. Fee charged for processing, packaging and shipping specimens to
reference labs at the request of the decedent's next-of-kin for testing.
(15) Lab use fee. Fee charged to institutions authorized by the Medical Examiner and County Board
to use the Medical Examiner's Office and supplies for teaching purposes.
(16) Expert witness fees. Fees will be charged to attorneys for case review, expert consultation and
trial/deposition time for the Chief Medical Examiner, Assistant Chief Medical Examiner
Assistant Medical Examiners, and Toxicologists for Medical Examiner cases leading to civil
litigation. The Chief Medical Examiner shall be authorized to waive or reduce said fees where
warranted and shall be authorized to issue regulations regarding expert witness fees. Such fees
will not apply to criminal proceedings related to Medical Examiner cases.
(17) Cremation Ffee. Fee charged for cremation and storage of decedents cremated and stored by Cook
County. Cremation fees shall be paid to the Cook County Medical Examiner prior to the release
of the cremated remains, unless the Medical Examiner determines that the decedent and the
authorized person is indigent and unable to pay the cremation fee, or other special circumstances
warrant fee waiver in the Medical Examiner's discretion.
***
BE IT FURTHER ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners, that Chapter 32 Fees,
Sec. 32-1 of the Cook County Code is hereby amended as follows:
Sec. 32-1. Fee schedule.

Subject matter: Plaintiff alleges race discrimination and retaliation in violation of Title VII of the

Civil Rights Act of 1964 during his employment with Cook County Sheriff’s Office. Plaintiff filed
his complaint with the EEOC on May 11, 2015 and alleged he experienced a hostile work
environment, was passed over for promotions that he was otherwise qualified to receive and
removed from the position of a “Deputy Director” in Central Warrants due to previous complaints
filed by him against the Cook County Sheriff’s Office (“CCSO”). On June 29, 2016, the EEOC
issued a determination that the CCSO retaliated against Pate when he was removed from his
position of Deputy Director and made an Inspector. The CCSO has settled the matter pre-litigation
to avoid further litigation due to the EEOC findings. In exchange for a full release and the terms
of the agreement, Plaintiff will not seek reinstatement with the CCSO.
