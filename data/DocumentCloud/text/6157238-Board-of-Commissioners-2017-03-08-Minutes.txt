areas, and
WHEREAS, homeowners in Illinois have the second-highest property taxes in the nation; and
WHEREAS, local spending is increasing at alarming rates, contributing to the debts across the State of
Illinois; and
WHEREAS, Cook County has not increased its property tax levy since 1994; and
WHEREAS, property taxes are increasing while home values are still lower than 2007 values; and
WHEREAS, a property tax freeze would give local control over property tax levies, taxing bodies would
increase property taxes through voter referendum, and local taxing bodies would be held accountable and
be forced to control their spending; and
WHEREAS, a property tax freeze would alleviate some of the struggles homeowners experience with
homeownership; and
WHEREAS, high property taxes in Illinois disproportionality hurt the poor and minorities; and
WHEREAS, in Maywood, the effective residential property tax rate is 5.29%, in Bellwood, the effective
residential property tax rate is 5.21%, and in south suburban Riverdale a home owner that sold their home
for $7,500 paid a $2,825 per year property tax bill, which is an effective tax rate of 38 percent, and over ten
years that home owner would pay three times what their property is worth in property taxes; and
WHEREAS, over a sixteen year period from 2007 to 2023, homeowners in five south suburban
communities would have paid more than twice their home’s full value in property taxes; and
WHEREAS, over that same sixteen year period 35 other communities will have paid more than 100 percent
of their home’s value in property taxes; and
4

WHEREAS, a total of 21 of 51 south Cook County suburbs now have median sale prices of less than
$100,000; while no suburb had a median sales price below $100,000 in 2007; and since 2007 the south
suburbs of Riverdale, Harvey, Phoenix, Crestwood, Markham, Robbins, Calumet City, Dixmoor, Sauk
Village, Posen, Hometown, and South Chicago Heights have seen their property values diminish by over
50%; and
WHEREAS, high property taxes are a major factor for families leaving Illinois, a property tax freeze would
encourage residents to stay in Illinois, and further benefit the state’s economy; and
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, That the Cook County Board of Commissioners does hereby
urge the Governor’s office, and the Illinois General Assembly to support, and pass a property tax freeze in
order to ease the burden of Illinois residents, especially those that are disproportionately affected by the
high tax rates in poor communities.

PROPOSED NO CASH BID REQUEST
Requestor: George Pappas, City Attorney, City of Palos Hills
Request: Approval of No Cash Bid Request
Location: City of Palos Hills
Volume and Property Index Number:
151, 23-14-400-039-0000.
Summary: As the City Attorney, I have been directed by the City Council of Palos Hills to request
participation in the 2017 No Cash Bid Program. The following is submitted for your consideration. One
parcel is sought by the City. The property is improved with an old racquet club, which has been
abandoned and unoccupied for over 15 years. The terrible condition of the building poses a significant
risk to the safety of children living in the area. The City intends to demolish the building, restore the land
and keep and maintain it as open land or a park for the benefit of the community.
The City will file for tax exempt status because the property will be for municipal use. There are no third
party requests for the parcel. Also, the City will pay all costs associated with this acquisition, including
my fees as City Attorney. It will submit a description of the status of the parcel to the Cook County
Planning & Development Department as required by the Cook County No Cash Bid Ordinance. This
report will be filed each year for the next five years or until development is complete, whatever occurs
last.
_____________________________
A motion was made by Commissioner Sims, seconded by Commissioner Goslin, that the No Cash Bid
Request be referred to the Finance Subcommittee on Tax Delinquency. The motion carried.

Concurrences:
The contract-specific goal set on this contract was zero.
The Chief Procurement Officer concurs.
Summary: The Bureau of Technology requests approval of two amendments to Contract no.
1390-12899 with Oracle America, Inc. to 1) exercise the County’s Universal License Agreement
(“ULA”) expansion option, and 2) add Oracle’s Talent Software and Hosting Services to the product pool
of the County’s agreement.
The ULA is a component of the overarching Contract that allows the County to establish its license
consumption levels before entering maintenance mode. Because the County is currently implementing
multiple large Oracle-based projects with varying go-live dates through 2020, such as Enterprise
Resource Planning, Integrated Property, and the Enterprise Service Bus, it is important that the County
exercises its ULA expansion option in order to accommodate the license consumption required by these
projects in the coming years.
The Oracle Talent Software and Hosting Services element represent the products purchased by Oracle
from Taleo Corporation, which the County previously purchased from Taleo Corporation under Contract
No. 09-41-351 in 2009 to provide automated recruiting, hiring, and onboarding for the County, Health
and Hospital System, Separately Elected Officials and Forest Preserve District.
The contract was awarded through the Request for Proposals (RFP) process in accordance with the Cook
County Procurement Code. Oracle America, Inc. was awarded this contract based on established
evaluation criteria.
