III.

**Report from System Human Resources Department (continued)
With regard to the information provided on Human Resources staffing, Director Carvalho stated that the
concept of centralizing and consolidating human resources functions has been thought by some to be a way to
save money and improve efficiencies; however, from the information presented, that appears to not be the case.
Ms. Lopez responded affirmatively; she indicated that consolidation efforts have created a bottleneck effect.
Some functions, particularly the on-boarding functions, should be located at the affiliates. Ms. O’Donnell added
that there needs to be day-to-day staffing for labor relations out in the field.
