ADMINISTRATIVE REPORT
Employee Handbook
Mr. Walsh informed the Trustees that Fund staff prepared a draft of an Employee Handbook and highlighted the four
main parts of the draft which contained substantive changes for the Trustees to consider. The main sections reviewed
were (1) Comp Time, (2) Vacation Leave, (3) Paid Sick Leave and (4) Tuition Reimbursement. Mr. Walsh reviewed the
updates and changes to each of these sections with the Trustees and explained the rationale for the suggested changes.
The Trustees suggested some alternative approaches. Mr. Walsh said he would review these approaches with counsel
and report at next month’s meeting.
Mr. Walsh also noted that he wanted to include an updated Ethics Policy as well as an updated Harassment Policy to be
included as attachments to any newly adopted handbook. Mr. Walsh then reviewed some of the reasoning for the
suggested updates to the Ethics Policy and the Harassment Policy and mentioned that draft amendments to those policies
would be circulated prior to the next regular Board meeting.
Some of the Trustees expressed an interest in further reviewing the draft handbook.
Tier 2 Widow Benefit
Mr. Walsh gave an overview of the Tier 2 Survivor Benefits matter and presented Trustees with a “Tier 2 Widow’s
Annuity (Death-in-Service) Decision Matrix”. See attached document. Mr. Walsh walked the Trustees through the
Tier 2 Widow’s Annuity Decision Matrix and the Trustees determined that Option 3, without reduction (i.e. $53.14
per month) and with a COLA, was the appropriate benefit in the situation being discussed.
The Board’s vote on this matter is recorded on page 4 of these minutes in the Spouse and Child’s Annuities section
of Schedule B.
Disability Administration Discussion
Mr. Walsh reviewed the LABF Duty Disability Offsets document which highlighted some of the current LABF
practices related to the administration of disability offsets and disability overpayment recovery. The Trustees
requested that Fund staff initiate a meeting with the City of Chicago’s Committee on Finance regarding the recovery
of disability overpayments directly from settlements/awards paid by the Committee on Finance. See attached
document.
Trustee Hamburger also suggested that the Fund should send out letters to recipients of disability payments reminding
them that they may owe the Fund a repayment if they receive a Worker’s Comp settlement/award related to their
disability. Trustee Capasso suggested that the Fund should require everyone receiving disability payments to sign
and have notarized a statement confirming that they understand that if they receive a Worker’s Comp
settlement/award, they may be required to repay some or all of the disability payments they received from LABF.
Legislative Matters
Mr. Walsh informed the Board that the Illinois Governor used his amendatory veto power with respect to House Bill
4811, which includes provisions affecting LABF. Mr. Walsh stated that it is not yet clear which portion(s) of the bill
were amended by the Governor and he will keep the Trustees updated on this matter.
Miscellaneous
Member Transfer Matter - Mr. Donham discussed Legal Counsel’s memo which was requested by the Board at the
July Board meeting in response to a letter from an LABF member who requested to transfer a portion of his LABF
pension service credits from LABF to the General Assembly Retirement System. Mr. Donham stated that Fund
Counsel had reviewed the applicable sections of the law, including 40 ILCS 5/11-125.1, and concluded that the transfer
of anything less than all transferrable credit was not permissible.
Senate Special Hearings – Mr. Walsh informed the Trustees of the Senate Special Committee on State Pension Fund
Investments to be held on October 16-17, 2018.
Year-to-Date Educational Hours – Mr. Carroll provided each Trustee a year-to-date summary of their educational
hours earned in 2018.
Marquette Symposium - Mr. Walsh reported that the Marquette Symposium is scheduled for Friday, September 28, 2018
and noted staff could coordinate registration for Trustees who are interested in attending.

 Duty Disability Offsets
Applicable Illinois Pension Code:
40 ILCS 5/11-158
Sec. 11-158. When disability benefit not payable.
(c) Before any action is taken by the Board on an application for a duty disability benefit or a widow's compensation or
supplemental benefit, the employee or widow shall file a claim with the employer to establish that the disability or
death occurred while the employee was acting within the scope of and in the course of his or her duties.
Any amounts provided to the employee or surviving spouse as temporary total disability payments, permanent
total disability payments, a lump sum settlement award, or other payment under the Workers' Compensation Act or
the Workers' Occupational Diseases Act shall be applied as an offset to the disability benefit paid by the Fund,
whether duty or ordinary, or any widow compensation or supplemental benefit payable under this Article until a
period of time has elapsed when the benefit payable equals the amount of such compensation, payment, or award.
The duty disability benefit shall be offset at the rate of the amount of temporary total disability payments or permanent
disability payments made under the Workers' Compensation Act or the Workers' Occupational Diseases Act.
If such amounts are not readily determinable or if an employee has not received temporary total disability payments
or permanent weekly or monthly payments for the entire period of disability up to the time of the compensation,
payment, or award under the Workers' Compensation Act or the Workers' Occupational Diseases Act, the disability
benefit paid by the Fund shall be offset by 66 2/3% of the employee's salary on the date of disablement. The offset shall
not be greater than the amount of disability benefits due from the Fund. The offset shall be applied until a period of
time has elapsed when the benefit payable equals the amount of such compensation, payment, or award. This offset
shall not apply to the initial days of disability when workers' compensation would not ordinarily be payable.
The amount of compensation or supplemental annuity payable to a widow shall be offset by any compensation,
payment, or award until a period of time has elapsed when the benefit payable equals the amount of such
compensation, payment, or award.
If an employee who has been disabled has received ordinary disability from the Fund and also receives any
compensation or payment for specific loss, disability, or death under the Workers' Compensation Act or the Workers'
Occupational Diseases Act, then the ordinary disability benefit must be repaid to the Fund before any other benefit
under this Article may be granted or paid. If no other benefit is applied for, then the ordinary disability is offset
according to the provisions of this Section.
The employee and the employer shall provide the Fund, on a timely basis, with the entry of the settlement contract
lump sum petition and order settlement of any such lawsuit, including all details of the settlement.

 LABF Administration of Disability Offset/Overpayment Recovery
1.

Current LABF practices regarding Workers’ Compensation disputes (i.e. Illinois Workers’ Compensation Commission claims)
that necessitate offsets/recoveries
a. If member was denied Workers' Compensation benefits at the outset and decision is being formally disputed, LABF
allows member to apply for ordinary disability (50% of salary) benefits pending a resolution to the dispute
b. If member received Workers' Compensation benefits, but the employer has ceased paying benefits and the member is
formally disputing the stoppage of Workers' Compensation benefits, LABF allows member to continue to receive duty
disability benefits (typically 8-1/3% of salary) pending a resolution to the dispute
c. If member is receiving Workers’ Compensation benefits and the member is formally disputing the decision, presumably
under the belief the benefit does not provide adequate compensation, LABF allows member to continue to receive
duty disability benefits (typically 8-1/3% of salary) pending a resolution to the dispute
If necessary upon resolution in either scenario and based on applicable law (typically coinciding with a settlement or
award), LABF recovers any overpayments made to the member and/or offsets future benefits.

2.

Recent LABF initiatives to improve access to resolved disputes
a. Access to Committee on Finance database reports (iVos)
b. Better communication with Committee on Finance
c. Use of FOIA

3.

LABF communication with members regarding issue
a. On Ordinary/duty disability applications, members agree to certain conditions, one of which is that they will reimburse
LABF if a Worker’s Compensation settlement/award results in an overpayment by LABF
b. Initial letter going to members when LABF becomes aware of settlement/award; second letter including findings sent
upon LABF's review
c. Updated “warrant” (coming soon)
d. LABF letter to member upon identification of pending dispute (coming soon)

4.

Prevalence of IWCC claims
a. Staff began notating open IWCC claims on the monthly proposal beginning in April 2018
b. See August proposal

5.

Administrative Issues:
a. Collection
i.
Risk of not collecting back overpayments
ii.
Members upset regarding collection of overpayments
iii.
Widows required to repay
b. Complications
i.
Members retiring off of disability
ii.
Post-refund settlements
iii.
Switching back and forth between duty and ordinary status
c. Prospective or retroactive administration

6.

Possible Alternative Approaches
a. Cease granting ordinary disability benefits pending the outcome of a duty disability dispute
b. Cease payment of duty disability benefits when member ceases receiving Worker’s Compensation benefits even in
situations where the employer’s right to cease such payments is being formally disputed.
c. Convince the Committee on Finance to contact LABF prior to distribution of award/settlement, so as to determine the
net the amount owed to LABF

 Tier 2 Survivor Benefit
40 ILCS 5/1-160. Provisions Applicable to New Hires.
(f) The initial survivor's or widow's annuity of an otherwise eligible survivor or widow of a retired member or participant
who first became a member or participant on or after January 1, 2011 shall be in the amount of 66 2/3% of the retired
member's or participant's retirement annuity at the date of death. In the case of the death of a member or

participant who has not retired and who first became a member or participant on or after January 1, 2011,
eligibility for a survivor's or widow's annuity shall be determined by the applicable Article of this Code. The
initial benefit shall be 66 2/3% of the earned annuity without a reduction due to age. A child's annuity of an

otherwise eligible child shall be in the amount prescribed under each Article if applicable. Any survivor's or widow's annuity
shall be increased (1) on each January 1 occurring on or after the commencement of the annuity if the deceased member
died while receiving a retirement annuity or (2) in other cases, on each January 1 occurring after the first anniversary of
the commencement of the annuity. Each annual increase shall be calculated at 3% or one-half the annual unadjusted
percentage increase (but not less than zero) in the consumer price index-u for the 12 months ending with the September
preceding each November 1, whichever is less, of the originally granted survivor's annuity. If the annual unadjusted
percentage change in the consumer price index-u for the 12 months ending with the September preceding each November
1 is zero or there is a decrease, then the annuity shall not be increased.
(j) In the case of a conflict between the provisions of this Section and any other provision of this Code, the provisions
of this Section shall control.

Options 3: Widow’s Money Purchase Annuity
[§11-139]
Requires concluding that since §1-160(f) states
eligibility is “determined by the applicable
Article”, Option 3, which is a stand-alone
widow’s annuity benefit in Article 11 that is not
a function of the member’s “earned annuity”, is
in addition to, and does not conflict with,

N/A; §11-152 requires that an annuity of less than $100/month be converted to a $100 term annuity (assumes no COLA) AND §1-160(f) requires a
COLA for any widow’s annuity, which is adjusted annually based on inflation; therefore, since future COLA amounts are unknown, a “term” cannot
be a determined in advance. According to §1-160(j), §1-160 prevails in the event of a conflict; therefore, term annuity assumed to be inapplicable
for tier 2 widows.
Only available if (1) eligible for annuity, and (2) annuity less than $800
Yes; however, creates administrative challenge for term annuities due to variable COLA (administration TBD)
