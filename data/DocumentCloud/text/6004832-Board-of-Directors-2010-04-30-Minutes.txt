Auxiliary of John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County, was taken out of order, read into the record by
Chairman Batts, and approved.
Update on recent legislative activity regarding CCHHS
Chairman Batts stated that Commissioner Goslin recently proposed legislation to make the System Board
permanent; this legislation was referred to Commissioner Butler’s Health and Hospitals Committee of the
County Board for consideration. There have been meetings with various members of the County Board
to discuss any concerns they may have with the proposed legislation, and to further flesh out the finer
details.

IV.

Report from Chief Executive Officer
A. CCHHS 2010 System Leadership Goals
Mr. Foley presented the CCHHS 2010 System Leadership Goals (Attachment #2), and provided a
brief overview.
B. FY2010 System Operational Plan Update
Dr. Anthony Tedeschi, System Interim Chief Operating Officer presented the FY2010 System
Operational Plan Update (Attachment #3), and provided a brief overview.
Roz Lennon, System Chief Clinical Officer, provided additional information with regard to the
development of a patient safety and quality structure for nursing.
Dr. Tedeschi informed the Board that as of May 10th, the first two levels of the Stroger Hospital
parking garage will be dedicated solely for parking for patients and families. Director Carvalho noted
that this development is quite an achievement, and congratulated those involved in this initiative.
During the Board’s discussion of the development of partnerships with federally qualified health
centers (FQHCs), Director Ansell noted that there should be a checklist of criteria that the System
uses to determine whether a partnership will be beneficial for the System. Mr. Foley responded that
they are developing criteria as they pursue these partnerships; there is a great deal of potential for
partnerships and they are a key component of the strategic plan.

Board and Committee Reports
A. Minutes of the Board of Directors Meeting, March 26, 2010
During the Board’s consideration of the meeting minutes, Director Zopp inquired regarding the status
of the investigation of a patient complaint that was presented to the Board during the public testimony
at the meeting. She noted that there was to be follow-up on the specific complaints by the patient; in
addition to this, an investigation into whether the events that led to the complaint were isolated
incidents, or whether they were systemic in nature.

Action Items
A. Proposed Resolution honoring the Auxiliary of John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County
(Attachment #4)
(This item was taken out of order, during the Report from the Chairman of the Board.)
Chairman Batts, seconded by Vice Chairman Ramirez, moved the approval of the proposed
Resolution honoring the Auxiliary of John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County. THE MOTION
CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (Attachment #5)
Leslie Duffy, System Director of Procurement, provided information on the two contractual items
presented for the Board’s consideration. With regard to request number 1, additional information
was provided, detailing the activity to date. Mr. Foley provided an overview of this activity, and
noted that since the relationship with the group purchasing organization (GPO) was approved, the
System has methodically been looking at opportunities consistent with the spirit of the GPO and in
light of the System’s financial challenges. He added that the GPO is a major factor in the
performance improvement plan. There have been comparative analyses of the bids and pricing to
ensure that there is a true “apples to apples” comparison. Their analysis indicates that the System
will save $2 million over the three years by contracting with Standard Textile Co., Inc.

VI. Action Items
B.

Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)
Mr. Foley stated that he has had phone conversations on the subject over the past few days with
Commissioners Robert Steele and Deborah Sims. Commissioner Sims asked him to relay her
concerns regarding the loss of business and loss of jobs from Cook County as a result of this; he
noted that Standard Textile Co., Inc.’s headquarters are in Cincinnati, and their laundry service is in
Batavia.
Vice Chairman Ramirez noted that when the System Board approved the GPO, the intent was never
to do away with jobs here in the County. He recognized that the GPO has been beneficial to the
System and is part of the performance plan; however, he stated that when one looks at what will
happen to the workers who live or work less than a mile from Stroger Hospital, they will lose work or
their jobs. He stated that the testimony provided earlier by some of the owners of these businesses is
troubling, as it seems contradictory to the information provided relating to the item. He stated that
the Board should get all of the facts and have a true “apples to apples” comparison before deciding to
move forward.
*************
At this time, Chairman Batts recessed the meeting to the call of the Chair, in order to allow the
Special Board Meeting scheduled for 9:30 A.M. to be called to order and recessed to the call of the
Chair. Following this activity, Chairman Batts reconvened the Meeting, and the Board resumed its
consideration of the items presented.
*************
Mr. Foley stated that doing the side-by-side analysis was very complicated; he stated that he
personally looked at the analyses and data from three different sources and consulted with his team.
He stated that, as Chief Executive Officer, he is confident that the analysis is fair and that this $2
million savings, plus the chargeback from the GPO as referenced by Ms. Duffy, is a real savings.
Director Carvalho noted that the County Ordinance directed the System to look at a GPO as a way of
saving money, so that the System can provide more care. So the System, very systematically,
developed a request for proposals (RFP) for a GPO, went through the RFP process, went through all
of the steps necessary to develop a GPO, and finally engaged with the GPO. The whole point of the
GPO is that it saves money, by purchasing with the aggregate purchasing power of others in the
industry. The natural and inevitable next step is to systematically go through everything being
purchased, to try to figure out if it can be purchased at a better price under the GPO. With this
conclusion, in every instance in which the System purchases under the GPO, the following will
occur: a relationship will be disrupted with an existing vendor that the System has chosen to cancel
early for convenience; or relationships will be changed if the current vendor whose contract is
expired is not the vendor under the GPO. He stated that his question regarding whether the analysis
was accurate and the projected savings is real was addressed by Mr. Foley. With confidence in the
management’s analysis, he stated that he supports this item.

VI. Action Items
B.

Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)
Director Butler indicated that the GPO is not a new issue. He stated that the Board has been charged
to try and correct the System; he added that the Board cannot correct the System without touching
any pieces.
Director O’Donnell agreed with the comments made by Directors Carvalho and Butler; and added
that the GPO was a very long and well thought-out process.
Vice Chairman Ramirez stated that he has a concern with the reconcilement of some of the different
stories and pieces of information received at this meeting. He inquired regarding the results of the
second bid opening. Helen Haynes, System Associate General Counsel, responded that HLS was
lower than Angelica in response to both competitive bids. Mr. Foley added that there were two
bidders, Angelica and HLS, who responded to both competitive bids. Director Carvalho provided
additional information on the subject, noting that this was an unusual case in which the System had
gone so far to do this under the competitive bid process before there was a GPO. So the information
from the bid process is included in the information stream for comparison. Ordinarily, the
information provided for a GPO purchase would likely include an analysis of the marketplace and
current contract.
Chairman Batts indicated that Cook County Commissioners Edwin Reyes and Robert Steele were
present, and would like to address the System Board on the subject.
Commissioner Reyes inquired regarding the previous competitive bids and the RFP issued for this
product. He noted that the current vendor, Angelica, has been the vendor for this product for twentyfive years.
Commissioner Steele stated that one issue that was very germane to him relates to the projected
savings of $2 million over three years and whether this will be a realized savings; he noted that he
sponsored the Contract Measurement Ordinance, to monitor contracts to ensure that contract cost or
savings meet the projections and expectations are fulfilled during the contract period. He stated that
he was concerned with the loss of jobs in Cook County that will result from this contract, and noted
that the current vendor, Angelica, lies within his district. He stated that he did not believe the
comparison was a true “apples to apples” comparison.
Director Muñoz stated that he agrees with the concept of the GPO. He added that this situation was
inevitable, as the System uses the GPO as a primary source for resources and materials. He stated
that a mentoring report, showing how the GPO is mentoring small companies into their GPO ranks, is
needed from the GPO on a regular basis.
Elizabeth Reidy, System General Counsel, provided information on the Board’s authority in relation
to System contracts and procurement items. She stated that the System Board has the authority to
make purchases consistent with the County’s Procurement Ordinance and the enabling Ordinance,
which established the Cook County Health and Hospitals System. She stated that the enabling
Ordinance specifically says that a power and authority, responsibility of this Board, is to begin
making purchases through a purchasing consortia, such as a GPO.

CCHHS Board Members
Dear Board Member:
We are writing as front line doctors in Doctors Council SEIU who are concerned about the
implementation of the CareLink policy, which will include charging additional co-pays t o patients,
requiring retroactive payment, and turning away patients who do not comply with billing requirements.
We understand and support the need for more revenue to cover the uninsured. However, as front line
physicians who see the uninsured every day, we are concerned about any implementation of an
aggressive billing policy that is counter t o our mission and not conducive to improving the CCHHS
system. We would like to Board to meet with us t o discuss these issues before implementing the
proposed policy and to discuss the following:
At least 63% of the CCHHS system patients are "self-pay" -more than all the other safety net
hospitals in Chicago combined. Most of our patients have no disposable income, and any cashin-advance (or collection agency) tactics will simply cause people to stay home and could
ultimately remove any source of possible health care for them. Problems with communicating
the LOL billing process in different facilities already continue t o drive patients away;
We will lose patients under this policy, including those who may eventually obtain Medicaid and
then decide not to return to CCHHS. Now is not the time t o discourage the indigent from using
our system, rather, all efforts should be geared towards keeping our Medicaid and Medicareeligible patients in the system and gearing up the enrollment system to capture 3d party
payments, which should grow under the new healthcare legislation;
Requiring some patients to "return with the documents" as a requirement for care is an
insurmountable obstacle for some patients; turning them away for failure to comply is
problematic and may violate the mission to provide care t o all Cook County citizens "regardless
of ability to pay," and will clearlv discourage the undocumented, a sinnificant part of our
patient base, leavine:them t o emergent care.
We are concerned that an aggressive billing policy will result in the unnecessary expenditure of
CCHHS resources for collections;

 We believe that ideas such as this create a need for more physician, patient and community
representation on the CCHHS Board before such policies are adopted.
Thank you for your consideration of these comments. We hope you will rescind or revise this policy and
ensure that we are acting responsibly and within the intent of the CCHHS mission.
Respectfully,

I represent Healthcare Laundry Systems in Wheeling, IL, Cook County. On 3 separate occasions over the

last 3 years HLS has provided Cook County with the low price, low cost bid for laundry services including the current proposed cost of $4.5M over 3 years which is 30% less than your contract from the
Cincinnati based Standard Textiles. Their laundry sub-contractor is Wisconsin based and will receive
85% of the funds paid by Cook County - and they are not a minority owned business, and they are not a
local business. Why are we sending our dollars out of state?
We have been qualified as a provider by Cook County contract compliance, and we've abided by all of
the terms of the previous RFP's and proposal requests. We are the largest provider of healthcare
laundry services in Cook County providing over 75 million pounds of laundry service to healthcare
facilities annually. All of our employees, from senior management to production workers are Cook
County residents and taxpayers - and we're the low-cost qualified bidder.
Now a sole source contract is being signed, the terms of which are not being shared with the public. The
cost is being deceptively compared to the RFP responses with no evidence that the service requirements
are the same. The RFP had numerous errors, misrepresentations and omissions that made the cost
appear inflated, to include:

-

Providing 60,000 disposable pillows per year (that are already on a separate RFP)
Provide 250,000 scrubs per year to a facility that doesn't use scrubs
Provide 47,000 bed packs per year to a facility that doesn't use bed packs
Provide 6 FTE's for linen distribution and soil collection

These 4 errors are valued at over $1million per year - and they are just a sample of the issues in the
RFP. These discrepancies were brought to the attention of CCHHS purchasing staff on numerous
occasions, only to be ignored.
We ask that you put this multi-year, mulit-$million contract out for a fair and competitive, open bid. We
also ask that the bid be modified to be an accurate representation of the services, quantities and
products that Cook County will consume. This will ensure the residents of Cook County and the patients
of Cook County receive the best value and service that is available. The time for transparency and
integrity from the Cook County Health and Hospital System Board is now.

April 30,201 0
To the Cook County Health and Hospital System Board of Directors:

It has been called to my attention that the Cook County Hospital Board is on the
verge of approving a no-bid contract for laundry services. Such a move would halt
service from a local union vendor, Angelica Corporation, and may put 100 of their
employees out of work. I am very concerned about thls action.
Of course, the loss of local jobs is a serious concern for me. But more than that, I
understand there are many local firms that either alone or in combination could
provide the same services of the prospective launderer. From my understanding, these
are not the appropriate circumstances for a no-bid contract.
If there is a strong reason to proceed with a no-bid contract, it should be made public.
Otherwise, I urge the board to reconsider.
Sincerely,
David Orr
Cook County Clerk
