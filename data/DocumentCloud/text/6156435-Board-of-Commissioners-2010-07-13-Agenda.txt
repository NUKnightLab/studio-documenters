innovative program which contributes to and enhances county government in the United States”; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Department of Revenue identified internal practices that had not been
updated in over 15 years, including manual processes and functions that were not performed or were

RESOLUTION
RESOLUTION URGING THE STATE OF ILLINOIS AND OTHER
TAXING DISTRICTS AND COOK COUNTY MUNICIPALITIES TO ENACT A SALES TAX
RELIEF PLAN
WHEREAS, Cook County, Illinois (the “County”) is a home rule unit of local government as provided
for by the Illinois Constitution of 1970; and
WHEREAS, by virtue of its home rule unit status, the County is authorized to exercise any power and
perform any function pertaining to its government and affairs, including the power to tax, except as
constitutionally limited or denied by the Illinois General Assembly; and
WHEREAS, the Illinois Department of Revenue has defined “Sales Tax” to mean the following: the tax
imposed on sales of personal property for use or consumption, and which consists of “Occupation Taxes”
imposed on a seller’ receipts and “Use Taxes” imposed on amounts paid by purchasers; and
WHEREAS, the County’s Retailers’ Occupation Tax and the Service Occupation Tax had never been
adjusted since its inception, at the rate first imposed in 1992 of .75%; and
WHEREAS, in light of significant across-the-board budget cuts during the FY2007 budget process, and
in the interest of restoring the much needed funding to the newly independent Cook County Health &
Hospitals System, as well as begin to address the County’s structural deficit, this Honorable Body saw the
need to pass a 1% sales tax increase during the FY2008 budget, the first such increase in fifteen years;
and
WHEREAS, as a result of said increase, the County’s Retailers’ Occupation Tax and the Service
Occupation Tax, was raised to 1.75% or one and three-quarters of one penny on the dollar; and
WHEREAS, this government chose to roll back the County portion of the sales tax by .5%, which
represents approximately $200 million in savings for the County, in an effort to provide tax relief during
these difficult economic times, to its business owners and citizens, thereby lowering the County portion of
the sales tax back to 1.25%; and

ITEM #6 cont’d
WHEREAS, while other taxing districts within Cook County have routinely raised their property tax levy
and many their sales tax levy, Cook County Government has held the line on its levy since 1996 and the
property tax rate has steadily declined over that same time period, providing relief for homeowners; and
WHEREAS, the sales tax is made up of several taxing districts as follows: State of Illinois - 6.25%,
Regional Transportation Authority (RTA) - 1%, Cook County - 1.25%, and Municipal - .75% to 1.5%;
and
WHEREAS, in order to provide meaningful sales tax relief to our businesses and residents, other taxing
districts must also look to abate a portion of their sales tax; and
WHEREAS, Illinois has one of the highest sales tax rates in the country, in order to compensate for its
narrow sales tax base, which is narrower than 43 of the 46 states that implement a sales tax.
WHEREAS, this narrow sales tax base is due to Illinois’ exclusion of almost all consumer services,
whereby of the 164 taxable services that could be included in the sales tax base, Illinois taxes only 17.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners does
hereby urge all municipalities in the County of Cook as well as the State of Illinois and other taxing
districts that receive a portion of the sales tax to follow Cook County’s example and also reduce their
portion of the sales tax to provide some much needed tax relief to our citizens; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that this Honorable Body also urges the Illinois General Assembly to
expand the sales tax base, thereby allowing the state and local governments to stabilize their budgets as
well as provide further tax relief to businesses and residents alike; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Secretary of the Board of Commissioners deliver a suitable
copy of this Resolution to all mayors of Cook County municipalities, as well as all members of the
Illinois General Assembly and the Board of Directors of the RTA.

COOK COUNTY HEALTH & HOSPITALS SYSTEM
HEALTH SYSTEM’S FIVE-YEAR STRATEGIC AND FINANCIAL PLAN
ITEM #30
REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON HEALTH & HOSPITALS #307672
Transmitting a Communication from
WARREN L. BATTS, Chairman, Cook County Health & Hospitals System Board
and
WILLIAM T. FOLEY, Chief Executive Officer, Cook County Health & Hospitals System
Pursuant to the Ordinance establishing the Cook County Health & Hospitals System, the Board of
Directors of the Health System respectfully submits the Health System’s Five-Year Strategic and
Financial Plan to the Cook County Board of Commissioners for its approval.
The Health System began the planning process for its Five-Year Strategic and Financial Plan in May of
2009. This process entailed extensive community input and participation from a variety of stakeholders.
At the outset of the process, as well as while the Plan evolved, the Health System conducted a series of
Town Hall meetings for the public throughout the County. The Health System also held a series of
employee, staff and physician Town Hall meetings at various System Affiliates. In addition, over 500
patients and other stakeholders were interviewed regarding their assessment of the County’s healthcare
needs and the Health System’s current state.
System leadership and staff have been closely involved in all phases of the planning process. Physicians
and staff participated in four (4) Service Line Working Groups established to make recommendations on
the configuration of the delivery of healthcare services in critical areas.
The Five-Year Strategic and Financial Plan presented for the County Board’s approval is the culmination
of this collaborative process. The ultimate goal of the Plan is to provide more access and more care
within available resources. The guiding principle of the planning process was to create a healthcare
delivery framework to provide for more appropriate access to care for the vulnerable population in Cook
County within available resources.
In support of the Health System’s mission, the vision of the Five-Year Strategic and Financial Plan is that
the Health System will be recognized locally, regionally, and nationally – and by patients and employees
– as a progressively evolving model for an accessible, integrated, patient-centered, and fiscally
responsible healthcare system focused on assuring high quality care and improving the health of residents
of Cook County.
The Ordinance establishing the Health System provides that the County Board shall approve each
Strategic and Financial Plan if, in its judgment, the Strategic and Financial Plan is complete, is reasonably
capable of being achieved, and meets the requirements set forth in the Ordinance. After the System
Board submits a Strategic and Financial Plan to the President and the County Board, the County Board
shall approve or reject such Strategic and Financial Plan within 45 days or such Strategic and Financial
Plan is deemed approved.
The Health System Board respectfully requests that this item be referred to the Health & Hospitals
Committee.

Reason:

The 016-445 Operation of Automotive Equipment account was reduced from the original
dollar amount the department requested to meet the required budget cuts. The account has
been impacted due to the price of gas increasing considerably during the year leaving
insufficient funds for the remainder of the fiscal year.

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
On May 7, 2010, $13,254.89 was expended. Due to the increase in gas prices the account is now
running a deficit.

2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
The accounts chosen to transfer from were the only line items in the budget which have funds
available that are less critical to the operation of the department.

Meeting of July 13, 2010

OFFICE OF THE INDEPENDENT INSPECTOR GENERAL
TRANSFER OF FUNDS
ITEM #81
APPROVED
Transmitting a Communication, dated June 22, 2010 from
PATRICK M. BLANCHARD, Office of the Independent Inspector General
requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners to transfer funds totaling $9,000.00 from Account
080-260, Professional Services, to Account 080-350, Office Supplies, to supplement this account due to
the unforeseen utilization of office supplies.
Reason:

The Office of the Independent Inspector General (OIIG) has used a substantial portion of its
office supply allocation for computer paper, toner cartridges, folders, binders and flash drives
and other miscellaneous office supplies. The 2010 budget allocation of $6,000.00 for office
supplies was based on the past usage (2008 and a portion of 2009) of three investigators and
one administrative assistant. Those numbers for 2010 have increased to seven investigators
and one administrative assistant. By July 19, 2010, the number of investigators will increase
to 11, as the OIIG is in the process of hiring 4 new investigators. The number of
investigative reports, memoranda and letters has increased significantly since June 2009.
Additionally, the copying of evidentiary documents related to the OIIG's investigations has
increased to the point that the OIIG is using approximately one case of paper weekly. Toner
cartridge use has increased due to the number of documents generated and the storing of
investigative files has required the purchase of folders and binders. The increased workload,
too, has necessitated an increase in the purchase of writing pads and pens. It is anticipated
that with the increase in the number of investigators, the demand for office supplies will
continue unabated for the remainder of FY2010.

From Account 080-260 (Professional Services)

Total

$9,000.00

To Account 080-350 (Office Supplies)

Total

$9,000.00

1.

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
On June 14, 2010, the Office Supplies Account was $344.00. At this point it was realized that this
account would need to be replenished to meet the demand for the remainder of FY2010. The
account balance was $1,367.00 on May 11, 2010.

TRANSFER OF FUNDS continued
ITEM #81 cont’d
2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
The Professional Services Account, 080-260, was identified as the only account that had sufficient
funds to transfer to the Office Supplies Account. At this point in time, this account has been
underutilized due to other priorities that the OIIG has had to address. It was anticipated that a
significant portion of these funds would have been spent by this date.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from 080-260.
The Professional Services expenditures expected to be utilized for auditing has been delayed due to
changing priorities in the OIIG. It was anticipated that a significant portion of these funds would
have been spent for assistance with desk audits, but this has not occurred. It is now anticipated that
these desk audits will begin in August 2010.

4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified?

funds.
None.

delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will results in
the account that funds are transferred from 525-240.
There will be none.

If the answer to the above question is "none" then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
