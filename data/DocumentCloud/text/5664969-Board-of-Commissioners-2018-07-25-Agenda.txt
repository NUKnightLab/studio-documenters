pathology laboratory. It is located at Brookfield Zoo, the University of Illinois Zoological Pathology
Program functions as Medical Examiner for animals and is the only full-time accredited wildlife, exotic and

PROPOSED TRANSFER OF FUNDS
Department: Administrative Hearings
Request: Transfer of Funds
Reason: Transfer of funds is requested due to a $35,000.00 increase in the Department’s Salaries and
Wages of Regular Employees Account as a result of six positions within the Department of Administrative
Hearings recently certified by AFSCME Union Local 3696. The salaries of these positions have been
increased to union wage scale plus back pay from the date of certification. The Department is also
requesting an additional $5,000.00 transfer of funds for its Deputy Director position which shall replace
our currently funded Legislative Coordinator position. The Department is requesting a transfer of funds for
the difference in pay scale between the two job classifications. The Legislative Coordinator position will
no longer be a funded position within the Department of Administrative Hearings.
From Account(s): 540135, $35,000.00; 520830, $5,000.00
To Account(s): 501010, $40,000.00
Total Amount of Transfer: $40,000.00

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified?
accounts that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.

List any other

Acct# 540135 - Working Capital Maintenance of Data Processing Equipment was identified as a source
of transferred funds because it was $35,000.00 over funded due to a chargeback expense attributed to
Administrative Hearings in error. Acct#-520830-Professional Services was also used as a source of funds
because it was the only other account with sufficient funds available to facilitate the transfer. There are
no other accounts with sufficient available funds to facilitate this transfer.
Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result
in the account that funds are transferred from.

None.
If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was
originally budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in
the fiscal year.

Acct# 540135 was originally budgeted for chargeback expenses attributed to Administrative Hearings
from Bureau of Technology. $35,000.00 in chargebacks were attributed to Administrative Hearings in
error.
The department should be able to able to absorb the $5,000.00 reduction in Acct#520830

for serious illness, disability, or injury, in the immediate family of the employee. Eligible employees on
maternity or paternity leave may use sick leave during the first four (4) to eight (6) weeks following

extended upon the Leave Coordinator’s receipt of a medical statement indicating that the employee is
unable to return to work due to medical reasons.
(a) (b) Sick leave is granted by Cook the County because an employee is unable to perform
his/her assigned duties, or because his/her presence at his place of work would jeopardize the health of
co-workers. Accordingly, sick leave shall not be used for any purpose other than to cover an absence
related illness and shall not be used as additional vacation leave.
(c) All eligible employees shall be granted sick leave with pay at the rate of one working day for
each month of service. A month of service is one in which an employee is in a pay status for at least 15
working days in a calendar month. All eligible employees on a part-time work schedule shall be granted
sick leave with pay proportionate to the time worked per pay period. Sick leave may be accumulated to
equal, but at no time to exceed, one hundred seventy-five (175) working days. Records of sick leave
credit and use shall be maintained by each office or department in the Cook County Time and Attendance
System.
(b) Subsequent to December 3, 1962, sick leave may be accumulated to equal but at no time to
exceed 120 working days at the rate of 12 working days per year. Records of sick leave credit and use
shall be maintained by each office, department, or institution. Severance of employment prior to the use of
any part of such sick leave terminates all rights for compensation hereunder. Amount of leave
accumulated at the time when any sick leave begins shall be available in full, and additional leave shall
continue to accrue while an employee is using that already accumulated.

physicians, dentists, or other recognized practitioners; or for serious illness, disability, or injury, in the
immediate family of the employee. After five consecutive sick days, employees shall submit to their
department head a doctor's certificate as proof of sickness. Maternity leave shall not be considered as
sick leave.
(d) If, in the opinion of the head of the executive head of the office, or department, or institution,
the health of an employee warrants prolonged absence from duty, the employee will be permitted to
combine to his/her sick leave, vacation, and sick leave and personal days, with the approval of from the
Bureau Chief, Bureau of Human Resources.
(e) The employee may apply for disability under the rules and regulations established by the Cook
County Annuity and Benefit Fund Retirement Board.
(f) Severance of employment prior to the use of any part of such sick leave terminates all rights to
such sick leave accrual and compensation for such sick leave, except in the case of a reduction in force
resulting in employees being laid off and recalled from layoff status. If an employee is recalled from layoff
status into the same or a new position in the County Agency, and defined in Section Three of the Budget
Resolution, from which the employee was laid off, the employee shall receive the full benefit of the sick
leave accrual severed from the employee at the time of layoff.
Effective date: This ordinance shall be in effect immediately upon adoption.

District (Markham).
The purpose of the Suburban Municipal Districts DCSEP is to increase the number of suburban drug court

long-term health and safety needs of these individuals and their communities. Participants in the program
include adult men and women (age 18 and older) who are arrested/charged with new non-violent,
drug-related felony offenses and are diagnosed with substance use disorders. The majority of participants
are from minority communities.
Project funds are dedicated mostly for community-based case management and treatment services. The
remainder are used for staff, fringe benefits, supplies, training and travel.
