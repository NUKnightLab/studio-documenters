STAFF REPORT: 11-13-2019 MEETING
PREPARED BY: A. DYE
APPLICATION NUMBER: 19-6472
ADDRESS: 1301 ORLEANS
HISTORIC DISTRICT: LAFAYETTE PARK
APPLICANT: MARK GRZANKA, KIMBERLY FENCE & SUPPLY COMPANY
DATE OF COMPLETE APPLICATION: 10/30/2019
DATE OF STAFF SITE VISIT: 11/04/2019
SCOPE: ERECT FENCE
EXISTING CONDITIONS
Lafayette Park, a 78-acre development, spans the area between Orleans Street (east)/I-375 (west)/Gratiot
Avenue (north)/E. Lafayette Street (south). It is an example of the “superblock” urban planning ideal.
Designed as a cohesive whole, the project eliminated the grid plan of the then-existing streets and married
the principles of International style-architecture and Prairie-style landscape design. Developed over a
period of 10 years (1956 – 1967), the development includes residential, commercial and education
buildings which surround a 13-acre public park. The park, Lafayette Plaisance, features a rolling meadow
of manicured grass with curvilinear paths dotted by mature tree specimens.
Lafayette Park is one of the first planned urban renewal projects in the country, one of the most fully
realized and remains one of the most successful urban renewal developments of the 20th century. A
collaborative effort between Modern architect, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, developer Herbert Greenwald,
planner Ludwig Hilberseimer and landscape architect Alfred Caldwell, it contains the largest collection of
Mies van der Rohe residential architecture in the United States.
The project before the commission relates to Lafayette Towers which are located in the middle/eastern
section of Lafayette Park at 1301 Orleans Street. Constructed in 1963, the towers include two, 22-story
buildings with outdoor terraces; a low-rise parking structure with rooftop deck, pool, and bathhouse
(located between the towers); a large surface parking lot (directly south and spanning the width of the
towers) and open spaces. Glass walls, 16-feet in height, enclose the ground floors of the Towers are set
back from the buildings’ perimeters. This allows the outer structural columns to be exposed and provides
outdoor terraces around the base of each building, creating an illusion that the inside and outside are two
parts of the same whole. Broad lawns extend from both buildings – to Orleans Street to the east and the
park/Lafayette Plaisance to the west.

 PROPOSAL
With the current proposal the applicant is seeking the Commission’s approval for the following work
items:
 The erection of a six-foot tall black steel picket fence, to be installed along the north, west and
south sides of the property.
 A seven-foot wide double gate to be installed at the southern end of the property, in line with the
existing opening for the double stairs that lead down to the shopping center.
 The stated purpose of the fence is to improve security for the Towers residents.
STAFF OBSERVATIONS AND RESEARCH
 The fence will close off the Towers from the rest of Lafayette Park, while remaining open to the
eastern sidewalk and Orleans Street.
 The fence will eliminate access to the shopping center and Lafayette Towers from the remaining
residents of Lafayette Park. Similarly, Lafayette Tower residents will need to walk the perimeter of
the full development to gain access to the park, townhouses and the Pavilion.
 Along the southern boundary, the fence and double gate will run adjacent to the existing iron
railing that surrounds the recessed stairway to the shopping center. It will also be taller than the
existing railing.
 The application does not indicate the distance between the new fence and the existing railing.
ISSUES
 A major component of the superblock concept was the deliberate inclusion of high-density
residential complexes to leverage expansion of the public open space. All of the structures were
designed to interplay with each other and the greenspace; pedestrian access through the
development was a major tenent of its historic design. The fence installation is in direct conflict
with the design and historic significance of Lafayette Park.
 The original design for parking was set below-grade to further subjugate its importance in the
landscape while providing better views for residents. The shopping center was also constructed
below-grade (hence the need for the stairs).
 While the existing surface parking lot south of the towers was not called out in the original master
plan, its openness allows it to retain a secondary visual impact on Lafayette Park and the Lafayette
Plaisance.
RECOMMENDATION
It is staff’s opinion the work as proposed will result in the alteration of features and spaces that characterize
the property as it will create a physical and visual barrier between the Towers, Lafayette Plaisance and the
other development’s buildings and residents.
Staff therefore recommends that the Commission deny a Certificate of Appropriateness for the work as
proposed because it does not meet the Secretary of the Interior Standards for Rehabilitation, Standards:
#2) The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of historic materials
or alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided.
#5) Distinctive features, finishes and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that
characterize a property shall be preserved.
#9) New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials
that characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible
with the massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and
its environment.

 By council member____________________________________________________:
an ordinance to
amend chapter 25, article ii, of the 1984 Detroit city code by adding section 25-2-145 to establish the Lafayette
Park/Mies Van der Rohe historic district, to establish rehabilitation as the design treatment level for the district,
and to define the elements of design for the district.
It is hereby ordained by the people of the city of Detroit that:
section 1. Chapter 25, article ii, of the 1984 Detroit city code be amended by adding section 25-2-145 to
read as follows:
Sec. 25-2-145. Lafayette Park/Mies Van der Rohe historic district.
(A)
A historic district to be known as the Lafayette Park/Mies Van der Rohe historic district is hereby
established in accordance with the provisions of this article.
(B)
This historic district designation is hereby certified as being consistent with the Detroit master
plan.
(C)
The boundaries of the Lafayette Park/Mies Van der Rohe historic district are as shown on the
map on file in the office of the city clerk, and shall be as follows: starting at a point, that point being the
intersection of the centerline of east Lafayette Boulevard and Rivard Street; thence northwards along the
centerline of Rivard Street to its intersection with the centerline of Antietam Street, which follows in part the
lines of the former Catherine street and Russell street; thence easterly, northerly, and easterly along the
centerline of Antietam Street to its intersection with the centerline of that portion of Orleans Street lying north
of Chestnut Street; thence southerly along the centerline of Orleans Street to its intersection with the centerline
of Chestnut Street; thence easterly along the centerline of Chestnut Street to its intersection with the centerline
of that portion of Orleans Street lying south of Chestnut Street; thence southerly along the centerline of Orleans
Street to its intersection with the centerline of Lafayette Boulevard; thence westerly along the centerline of
Lafayette Boulevard to the point of beginning. Legal description: lots 8 through 22, 25, 26, and 30, Lafayette
Park subdivision of pc 6, 181, 7, 132, 12, 13, 8 and 17. City of Detroit, Wayne County, Michigan, l 80 p 8791, wcr.
(D)
The design treatment level of the Lafayette Park/Mies Van der Rohe historic district shall be
rehabilitation as provided for in section 25-2-2 of this code.
(E)
The defined elements of design, as provided for in section 25-2-2 of this code, shall be as
follows:
(1)
Height. The buildings in the Lafayette Park/Mies Van der Rohe historic district range from one
(1) to twenty-one (21) stories tall. All tall buildings are at twenty-one stories with one
penthouse story above the roof line, and all other buildings are one or two stories, the only
exception being the complex at the southwest corner of orleans street and chestnut street which
reaches a maximum of seven stories from grade and a minimum of three stories from grade with
an additional penthouse story above the roof line. The distribution of low-rise and high-rise
buildings in the district generally follows the plan for the area developed by Mies Van der Rohe,
Ludwig Hilbersheimer and Alfred Caldwell.
(2)
Proportion of buildings’ front facades. Proportion varies in the district, depending on the height
of the building. Most of the front facades of the individual low-rise buildings are considerably
wider than tall with side elevations that are close to equal in height and width. All facades of
high-rise buildings are emphatically taller than wide. The seven-story building at the southwest
corner of Orleans Street and Chestnut Street is roughly balanced in height and width.
(3)
Proportion of openings within the facades. The proportion of openings varies widely. Doors are
generally taller than wide but door openings may be made wider through the use of glass panels
on one or both sides of the door. Individual panes of glass are wider than tall, taller than wide,
or about equal in width and height. The use of glass as virtually the entire wall of a building is
common. The percentage of voids in facades ranges from none in the end walls of some low-rise
buildings to nearly 100% in those buildings with glass curtain walls.

(12)

Rhythm of solids to voids in front facades. In the buildings by Mies Van der Rohe, the use of
glass curtain walls virtually eliminates solids as part of the front facades. The three tall buildings
by Mies Van der Rohe all have recessed first and second story curtain walls, creating a
“colonnade” surrounding the building at grade, the vertical structural supports expressed as the
columns; the first floor of the two-story building in the shopping center is similarly treated. At
Four Freedoms/Windsor Tower, large approximately square window openings are centered in
external expressions of the structural frame while on the ground floor the voids and solids are
precisely reversed, the windows being at the sides of each structural bay and the center being
solid. In the upper floors narrow windows flank the service core wall at the center of the facade.
At Regency Square/Parc Lafayette the use of balconies tends to create spacial voids behind which
the window and door voids are in shadow; on the street facades facing chestnut the buildings
display large, flat areas of window flanked by sections of blank brick wall. A regular rhythm of
fenestration is typical in the district.
Rhythm of spacing of buildings on streets. Because the buildings in the district stand alone, or
stand on cul-de-sacs which are part of the total design of an individual complex, no one rhythm
of spacing of buildings on streets is established.
Rhythm of entrance and/or porch projections. Porch projections are rare on entrance facades.
Within the low-rise cul-de-sacs, there is often a regular rhythm of entrances to individual units;
the two-story Mies Van der Rohe townhouses are characterized by regularly repeated first floor
recesses containing the two front entrances of two adjacent units. The distance between
entrances varies in the one-story Mies Van der Rohe “court houses” depending on the size of
each unit. The front facades of the one-story buildings at the shopping center are sheltered by
continuous canopies supported on slender steel columns.
Relationship of materials. Building materials common to exterior surfaces in the district are
brick, granite, marble, glass and metal. Wood window frames exist in Chateaufort and
Cherboneau. Exposed aggregate panels exist only in the two-story building in the shopping
center.
Relationship of textures. The low relief pattern of mortar joints in brick, where it exists, provides
textural interest. Large glass surfaces are smooth in texture and often subdivided by small-scale
metal elements which creates a texture in the curtain walls of tall buildings. At Four
Freedoms/Windsor Tower, the external expression of the structural frame contains recessed brick
walls; therefore the entire facade takes on a texture.
Relationship of colors. Masonry is light in color; brick in the district is limited to the range of
yellow, buff, and tan. Red brick exists only in the storefronts of the former night club in the
shopping center, and is an intrusion there. Glass is often slightly gray-tinted or transparent; black
glass panels fill the window wall, the continuous cornice, and the shed dormer of Chrysler
School. The external metal elements are most often silver-grey in color, but are black on the
Mies Van der Rohe town houses and white in the shopping center. Wood window frames are
white or brown. The only visible roofs in the district are those in the Charboneau complexes;
they are brown asphalt shingle. The original colors of any building, as determined by professional
analysis, are always acceptable, and may provide guidance for similar buildings.
Relationship of architectural details. Architectural details are limited to expressions of structure
and the subdivision of glass curtain walls. All of the buildings in the district are in the modern
style of the 1960's, which avoided decorative details.
Relationship of roof shapes. The roofs of the Lafayette Park/Mies Van der Rohe historic district
are not visible from the street, with the exceptions of the Charboneau complexes, which have
low-pitched gable roofs.
Walls of continuity. Walls of continuity do not exist except in each of the low-rise residential
complexes, in which the buildings form a strong wall of continuity along the cul-de-sacs.
2

 (13) Relationship of significant landscape features and surface treatments. The district is
characterized by planned landscaping, generally created for each development. Landscaping is
generally mature, and especially well developed in the Mies Van der Rohe townhouse
developments. Paving exists as sidewalks and as parking lots, placed by plan in each
development and open to view from public rights-of-way only at the shopping center. There is
extensive use of grass turf lawn, which is the major landscape feature of the open space of the
park.
(14) Relationship of open space to structures. The major open space in the district is the park, a
large passive recreational area running north and south in the center of the district between the
developments which are entered from Rivard Street and the developments entered from Orleans
Street. There are tennis courts at the northwest corner of the park. Four Freedoms/Windsor
Tower lies at the north end of the park, and Chrysler School lies at the south end. Each low-rise
complex has its own arrangement of buildings in relation to open space, designed as part of the
complex. Regency Square/Parc Lafayette orients itself inward to a large open court containing a
swimming pool and planted space in the center of the complex. The shopping center has a large
open space in the form of a parking lot at the corner of Lafayette Boulevard and Orleans Street
and a smaller open space in the form of a pedestrian plaza contained within the individual
buildings of the center. Lafayette Towers has, in effect, an open space for the use of its tenants
atop its parking structure, which contains a swimming pool. While some individual
developments are open to the park, some employ their own fencing. Regency Square/Parc
Lafayette is set apart by a brick wall, Chateaufort by stockade fencing, and the Pavilion by black
metal pickets.
(15) Scale of facades and facade elements. Individual building facades are small in scale in the
low-rise complexes and large in scale for the high-rise buildings.
(16) Directional expression of front elevations. Tall buildings are vertical in expression and low-rise
buildings are horizontal in expression.
(17) Rhythm of building setbacks. Rhythm of setback does not generally exist in the district, except on
the cul-de-sacs, where the setbacks have been determined by the overall plan of the individual
complex.
(18) Relationship of lot coverages. Lot coverage varies widely according to the design of the
individual development plans.
(19) Degree of complexity within the facades. The degree of complexity is generally simple.
(20) Orientation, vistas, overviews. All building complexes are positioned around a central
rectangular park. The orientation of the townhouses vary according to the design of each
individual development. Regency Square/Parc Lafayette is oriented inwards towards an
outdoor courtyard. Tall buildings are accessed from the perimeter streets but are primarily set in
the park. Chrysler school is oriented towards East Lafayette Boulevard; the layout of the three
buildings of the shopping center create a pedestrian friendly atmosphere that connects by
footpaths to the residential development behind. Vistas from the apartment buildings offer
dramatic views of downtown Detroit to the west, historic eastern market and Saint Joseph R.C.
church to the north, and the Detroit river to the south.
(21) Symmetric or asymmetric appearance. Most buildings are symmetrical or give the appearance of
symmetry.
(22) General environmental character. The general character of the Lafayette Park/Mies Van der
Rohe historic district is that of a substantially intact planned community of the 1950s and 1960s,
with a very high level of architectural quality and substantial public amenities.
Section 2. All ordinances or parts of ordinances, or resolutions, in conflict herewith are hereby repealed.
Section 3. This ordinance is declared necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, safety and
3

 welfare of the people of the City of Detroit.
Section 4. In the event that this ordinance is passed by a two-thirds (2/3) majority of city council members
serving, it shall be given immediate effect and become effective upon publication in accordance with section
4-116 of the 1997 Detroit City Charter. Where this ordinance is passed by less than a two-thirds (2/3) majority
of city council members serving, it shall become effective no later than thirty (30) days after enactment in
accordance with section 4-115 of the 1997 Detroit City Charter.

4

 Summary
This proposed ordinance would amend chapter 25, article 2, of the 1984 Detroit city code by adding
section 25-2-145 to establish the Lafayette Park/Mies Van der Rohe historic district, to establish rehabilitation
as the design treatment level for the district, and to define the elements of design for the district.

Re: Lafayette Tower Fence Installation
To Whom It May Concern,
Kimberly Fence is proposing to install a 6’ Montage Plus Classic 3 Rail steel picket fence in the
color black on the north, west and south side of the property located at 1301 Orleans St.
Currently, the site has no fence in this area. There are adjacent properties that have similar styles
of fence.
The property owners would like the fence to improve security for their residents.
The following is a description of the scope of work:
•
•
•
•

The site will be staked to layout the property boundaries.
Miss Dig will be contact to mark all underground utilities.
Kimberly Fence will excavate for post hole foundations and set posts in a concrete
footing.
The posts will set for several days before panels are hung to complete the project.

See the attached product cut sheet and brochure.

Sincerely,

Mark Grzanka

Dear Detroit Historic District Commission 
I am a resident in the Joliet Co-Op Mies towers, on the other side of Lafayette Park from
Lafayette Towers. I am writing to express my opposition to plans for a new fence between
Lafayette Park and the Lafayette Towers. 
 
The communities surrounding Lafayette Park are wonderful, friendly and very urban minded. 
You will always see people walking - in the early mornings and evenings even - through the
park on their way to/from downtown, the shopping center on Lafayette, or walking their dogs. 
Erecting the fence as proposed will cut off access to residents of our community going about
their lives.  It also serves as an awful visual message that our neighborhood is not open or safe
- which it is!  Furthermore, it will disrupt the unique visual beauty of our park and the modern
architecture within it.
 
Please do NOT approve the fence! 
 
Thank you,

Saturday, November 2, 2019 1:44:20 PM

I am OPPOSED to the plans for a 6 foot fence at 1301 Orleans due to its impact to the
community overall, including:
the disruption accessibility to the neighborhood resources of Lafayette Foods, Dollar
General, the restaurants, and the Lafayette Park
the affect traffic flow and create congestion on Orleans as more cars and visitors are bottlenecked checking into the slow and efficient security gate
Additionally, this area is a historical district and will take away from the character of the
community.

1301 Orleans Fence Proposal
Saturday, November 2, 2019 11:52:58 AM

Gentlemen,
 
I do not approve of the proposed fence at the west side of the property located at 1301 Orleans. 
The Historic District regulations were put in place to regulate the properties within the district to be
maintained without major change.
 
The proposed fence is a major change to the character of the park.  It is NOT in the spirit of the
Historic District.  No other location has been allowed to add fencing since the historic district has
been in place. 
 
Making this property a gated community is not in keeping with the original concept of Lafayette
Park.  It also would open the door to other park communities to also request fencing, totally
destroying the open park feeling.
 
Thank you for your consideration.

Comment For 1301 Orleans Application For Fence
Friday, November 1, 2019 9:58:37 PM

To Whom It May Concern:
My name is Andrew Pan and I have been a resident at Lafayette Towers (1301 Orleans) for 4
years.
I am very disappointed to hear there is a proposal to erect a fence to enclose the north, west,
and south sides of the property.
This is a severe disruption to the ease of access for a resident to the grocery store plaza
(Lafayette Foods and Dollar General plaza) as well as the actual park (Lafayette Park). As a
resident, I do not want to have to walk out of a single exit (east side of the property) and then
walk around the perimeter of the fence to get where I want.
I am very disappointed and confused on the precedence of this proposal. The current check-in
system with having visitors come to through the security gate of the East tower is extremely
inefficient - by adding this fence, it will lead to severe traffic jams from cars lined up trying to
enter the property. The security staffing for staffing is EXTREMELY slow - delivery cars,
visitors, everyone waits at least 15 minutes for check-in.
Adding these fences will further lead to greater inefficiencies and affect general traffic flow
around Orleans and the property.
I implore the Detroit Historic District Commission to not support this proposal - the
management of Lafayette Towers erecting this fence will disrupt the accessibility to
resources/facilities in the neighborhood for me as a resident and will further lead to traffic
congestion in the area. I am unfortunately unable to attend the hearing as I will be out of town
visiting my family in New Jersey.
If you have more questions or would like further clarity, please feel free to reply to this e-mail
or call me at my cell phone 732-763-1792.

Feedback for the Public Record: Opposition to Proposed Fence @ 1301 Orleans
Thursday, November 7, 2019 3:07:40 PM

Dear Mr. Landsberg and Historic District Commission Staff & Members:
My name is Debra Taylor and I am writing you to express my opposition to the proposed
fence  at 1301 Orleans – Lafayette Park/Mies van der Rohe HD – Erect a new 6’-0”-high
fence to enclose the north, west and south side of the property!! The proposal does not honor
the concept of what the original architechs and residents of Lafayetta Park intended to create
when this community was conceptualized!
Lafayette Park was meant to be a walkable community with plenty of green space with
accessibility to retail and services by a multi cultural and social economic mix of residents. 
Imposing a 6 foot fence, which blocks access from thousands of pedistrian residents to retail,
services and transporation lines does not serve, support nor reflect the type of community that
Lafayette Park is or what it was meant to be!
It is already an imposition to have developers cramping in more rental properties and
encumbering our green space; changing traffic patterns, making our "suburb inside the city"
environment more hectic! But a fence blocking the community from easy access to retail,
services and transportation is unacceptable!
Please assure that my comments are entered into the public record. I hope that you will alert
our communities to the outcome of the public hearing coming up on November 13, 2019!
Thanking you in advance for your cooperation and consideration.

Fence at Lafayette Park
Saturday, November 2, 2019 11:08:35 AM

To Whom it May Concern,
Please reject Lafayette Towers request to erect a 6’ fence frankly anywhere on its property. I
am currently a resident of the towers and enjoy the seamless connectivity to the park and
plaza. Management at Lafayette Towers has already disrupted the Detroit landmark multiple
times. They have security that is constantly asleep or away from their posts. If necessary, I
know many people who can attest and even document this. This decision ruins a great
community that already exists—something that the rest of Detroit is trying recreate. There is
no room for anymore backward decision made by the owner of these towers as they continue
to degrade the cities icon. 
Thank you very much. 
Sincerely,
Sammy Sater

The fence proposed by Lafayette Towers in Lafayette would have
adverse effects on the park, those using the park, and the shopping

Lafayette Park Fence Proposal
Wednesday, October 30, 2019 3:57:50 PM

Good afternoon,
I have been a resident of Lafayette Park for the 18 years.  After graduating from Osborn High
School I attended Michigan State University.  Being born and raised in Detroit I wanted to
return to the city after college, and I am happy to say that I did by moving into Lafayette
Towers in 2001.  After 8 wonderful years there it was time for me to move.  I looked all over
the city but found Lafayette Park was home, so I purchased my first home in the Leland Lofts,
right across the park from Lafayette Towers.  
The park connects all of the residents in Lafayette Park and makes it a wonderful community
to live in.  I am adamantly opposed to the fence proposal.  Cutting off access to the shopping
center from the park is absolutely ridiculous and should not be permissible.  There are plenty
of long time residents, new tourists and elderly that use that walk way to gain access to the
shopping center.  Having to go all the way around to Rivard and up to Lafayette or over to
Orleans and up to Lafayette makes absolutely no sense and takes away significantly from the
community we have.  
Please do not let this pass. It's infuriating.  
Thank you,
-Ric Krajewski

Lafayette Park Fence
Saturday, November 2, 2019 5:04:58 PM

Hello,
I was recently made aware that on Wednesday, November 13th a representative of Lafayette Towers will be seeking
approval from the Historic District Commission for a 6-foot high fence that will cut in-between existing pathways of
Lafayette Park and specifically block access to the nearby shopping center.
As a resident of Lafayette Park, I am writing to voice my concern. The park is shared between many more residents
than just the Lafayette Towers. I do not believe they should be able to cut through shared pathways to build a fence.
The current access between the park and the shopping center is a convenience that I do not feel is fair to take away
from other residents and people enjoying the park.
I hope you will consider my concerns and those of other Residents of the Lafayette Park community when reviewing
the proposal.
Thank you,
Taylor Smith

Lafayette Park: Fence for Towers on Orleans
Thursday, November 7, 2019 1:28:45 PM

Thank you for allowing us to express via email as I will not be able to attend.
Putting up a gate in such a manner as suggested violates everything about the
historic nature of Lafayette Park.  In addition, blocking off access to and from the
Lafayette Strip Mall will effect, not only the residents but also the success of those
individual stores.
I am hopeful that the HDC rejects this from the actual standpoint of the violation of the
historic nature in which we live.  
While I live in Chateaufort (Just north on Orleans) and am VP of our Cooperative and
understand safety/security, their approach to security should follow Lafayette Park
Historic vision.  There are other solutions to security.

Lafayette Towers" request for approval to place a fence between Lafayette Park and West Tower
Wednesday, November 6, 2019 9:19:38 PM

I have been a resident of Lafayette Park area since 1976.  I have enjoyed the park year round during
these 40 odd years for exercise and socializing with other residents of the area, both east & west of the
park.
I object to the Towers' request to build a fence between the park and the West Tower.  Such a fence will
close easy access to the Lafayette Plaza retail area and negatively impact the open feeling of the park.
Please decline this request.

Lafayette towers security fence.
Wednesday, October 30, 2019 4:54:27 PM

Hi there,
My name is Bridget Finn, I live at and own 1349 Nicolet Place in Lafayette Park. I am writing to express my
opposition to the proposed fence that stands to be build by Lafayette Towers (which was my residence prior to
buying my Townhouse.) This fence is absolutely unnecessary and it’s actually offensive, further separating off a
Neighborhood that’s already divided by social economic issues.  Additionally, the towers do not own the mini-mall,
nor do they get to determine who walks through the park to get groceries. We have many elderly neighbors
surrounding the park and it’s beyond offensive to make them walk fully around from Rivard to Lafayette to get their
groceries. I couldn’t hate this more. My cell phone is 313-204-7824.
My best,
Bridget Finn.

Plans for fencing by Lafayette Towers / Lafayette Park (Email from Resident)
Wednesday, November 6, 2019 3:13:48 PM

Dear Detroit Historic District CommissionI am a resident in the Joliet Co-Op Mies towers, on the other side of Lafayette Park from
Lafayette Towers. I am writing to express my opposition to plans for a new fence between
Lafayette Park and the Lafayette Towers. 
The communities surrounding Lafayette Park are wonderful, friendly and very urban minded. 
You will always see people walking - in the early mornings and evenings even - through the
park on their way to/from downtown, the shopping center on Lafayette, or walking their dogs. 
Erecting the fence as proposed will cut off access to residents of our community going about
their lives.  It also serves as an awful visual message that our neighborhood is not open or safe
- which it is!  Furthermore, it will disrupt the unique visual beauty of our park and the modern
architecture within it.
Please do NOT approve the fence! 
Thank you,
Laura Lewis

Proposal to Erect 6’ Fence at Lafayette Towers, 1301 Orleans Street
Sunday, November 3, 2019 11:37:54 AM

Sir/Madame:
I have lived as a tenant at Lafayette Towers since 2010, and wish to express my strong
opposition to the proposal to erect a 6 foot fence around the North, West and South perimeter
of the buildings’ grounds. This would be a travesty, turning our living area into a walled
compound and separating the apartment buildings from the surrounding park, markets and
neighborhood.
One of the major appealing aspects of Lafayette Towers is that it is integrated into its
surroundings - Lafayette Park, the markets immediately south along Lafayette Blvd., and
generally the adjoining neighborhoods.  I lived for several years at Riverfront Apartments
which epitomizes the isolated compound mentality and it was a bad experience.  I felt
completely dissociated from any sense of neighborhood, indeed the City itself.
In closing I wish to convey that if this proposal is allowed and the fence built, I will likely be
ending my lease at Lafayette Towers.   I know many residents that feel the same.  Thank you.

Proposed Fence and Gate Between Lafayette Park and the Shopping Center
Thursday, November 7, 2019 1:54:25 PM

Dear Detroit Historic District Commission,
One of the reasons my wife and I were drawn to Lafayette Park for our retirement was the proximity to
shopping (Lafayette Market) where we could walk to the market and not have to drive a car.  The walk to
the market through the park and down the steps has been a peaceful trip to the market in a busy noisy
city.

The tranquility of the Park is a unique experience that should be enjoyed by all those who seek a
place to relax, stroll, ride and visit while traveling to their destination Living in the Park area we can
access friends’ homes , the school, shopping center and Lafayette using the stairs that are in this
proposed gated area. 
This fence and locked gate would be blocking public access to a commercial shopping district , bike
rental's, the Dequindre Cut, crosswalks and bus stops along Lafayette St.; etc. The only other pathway's
from the Park are next to the Chrysler Elementary School on east alley side near the dumpster (random
broken glass)and on the west side of the school, leading away from the public shopping area. There will
be more car traffic to avoid if foot traffic is forced to cross in front of the school going east and west.
The construction of a fence is not in the spirit and the design intent of this neighborhood and does not
coincide with the master plan visions of Lafayette Park architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. The fence
also directly cuts off access for Lafayette Tower residents to the park as well as other residents in both
the Pavilion and Leland Lofts
Please do not approve of this proposed fence and gate blocking our access to the stairway
Thank you
Sincerely

Proposed Fence in Lafayette Park
Thursday, October 31, 2019 10:59:16 AM

Historic District Commission,
I understand that-

On Wednesday, November 13th 2019 beginning at 5:35 PM in the auditorium on the 13th floor of
the Coleman A. Young Municipal Center located at 2 Woodward Ave, a representative of
Lafayette Towers will be seeking Historic District Commission approval to erect a 6-foot-high black
ornamental steel picket fence between the West Tower and the park. The fence will cut in
between existing trees and pathways disrupting current conditions in the landscape and existing
circulation patterns for all residents in the neighborhood. Additionally, a 6-foot-high gate is also
being erected at the top of the stairs that lead into the shopping center plaza. This fence and gate
will block off access for residents outside of Lafayette Towers that use the park to connect to the
shopping center. Please see posted image for a better representation of the fence’s location. The
construction of a fence is not in the spirit and the design intent of this neighborhood and does not
coincide with the masterplan visions of Lafayette Park architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. The
fence also directly cuts off access for Lafayette Tower residents to the park.
Aside from the visual aspect being a problem, cutting off the route to the shopping center is a
walking problem.
Please do not approve this idea,
Bob

Proposed Lafayette Towers Fence
Sunday, November 3, 2019 8:51:03 AM

Dear Historic Commission,
I am writing to formally and emphatically state my opposition to the proposed 6 foot high
fence Lafayette Towers proposes between their West Tower and the Lafayette Plaisance Park. 
I have lived in Lafayette Park for over almost 15 years now. I am aware of the pluses and
minuses of living in this city. A great plus, for me, is walking in the evening around the
Plaisance with my partner Liz Boone. We follow the looping sidewalk and say hello to the
neighbors and wrap up our day. This has been our habit for as long as we've lived together
here.
To put up a fence - and it will be an ugly fence - would be to cage in the park, and the people
walking in it. It is absolutely against the principle that built the park in the first place (and the
Towers, with their unfettered access to the park, were very definitely part of that original plan)
and such a fence would negatively impact the quality of life for all the people who enjoy the
park and its amenities, the repaved tennis courts, the people playing soccer and basketball, the
kids in the playground.
Fences - like walls - should be considered carefully. Especially in Nationally Recognized
Historic Neighborhoods. If the Commission exists to protect anything, it exists to protect this. 
If there are security issues, they can undoubtedly be addressed through other means, including
cameras and increased security. and coordination with the police.
Thank you and thank you for all you do to make Detroit great.
Sincerely, Toby Barlow
