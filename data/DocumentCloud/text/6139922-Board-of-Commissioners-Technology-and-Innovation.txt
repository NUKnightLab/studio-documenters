BUREAU OF TECHNOLOGY, by Antonio Hylton, Chief Information
Officer, transmitting a Communication:
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract
with U.S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY, Urbana, Illinois, to procure aerial
photgraphy.
Reason: This joint funding agreement represents the work of a
consortium involving the federal government, seven (7) counties
of Northeastern Illinois and a regional council of governments to
procure aerial photography for the benefit of each agency.
Because of the economy of scale and the philosophy of good
government, Cook County will realize a savings of
approximately $500,000.00 over the cost should the county
have acquired it solely. This consortium and this project are
unprecedented as a resource and data sharing initiative.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: $181,583.00. Contract period: February 1,
2008 through September 30, 2009. (545-260 Account). Requisition No.
