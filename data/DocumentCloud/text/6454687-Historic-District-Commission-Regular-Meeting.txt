PREPARED BY: J. ROSS

SCOPE: REHABILITATE BUILDING
EXISTING CONDITIONS
Erected in 1895, the building located at 267 E. Grand River is known as the Harmonie Club. Architect
Richard E. Raseman provided the building’s design. As per the Detroit Historic Designation Advisory
Board:
The building is a rectangular, four-story, hip-roofed, buff-colored brick structure of Beaux Arts
design approximately 75' X 100' in size. The two elevations are unified by a large curving corner
section. Above the low basement of rusticated stone, the brick first and second stories are banded
while the third and fourth stories are faced with flush brick masonry articulated with colossal
pilasters on pedestals. The one-over-one fenestration is symmetrically arranged. The windows on
the first and second levels have elaborate splayed lintels of banded brick while those of the third
and fourth stories are unarticulated. The fourth-story windows have arched tops. The symmetrical
facade on East Grand River Avenue is formally composed along classical lines. The central Ionic
ordered entrance is under a broad arch extending through the second floor. Above the projecting
molded metal course separating the second and third levels is a pedimented three-bay pavilion set
off by brick pilasters and ornamented with a stone balcony centered over the entrance arch. The
pediment contains a high relief, foliated cartouche. The Center Street elevation is less formally
composed with fenestration located to respond to floor plan requirements.

PROPOSAL

 The project proposes to undertake an exterior rehabilitation. As per the attached project drawings, specific
work items associated with the project include the flowing:
Rooftop
 Replace the current small rooftop HVAC unit with a new unit. See the view diagrams for
visibility from the right-of-way (ROW). The unit cannot be seen from the immediately
surrounding ROW. However, it will be seen across the parking lot from Madison, as can the
existing unit.
 Replace existing roof membrane with a new EPDM membrane
 Replace all existing standing seam metal roofing (including mansard roof and dormers) with
new metal roof to match existing. Finish color green to match the trim/window color
 Repair the existing integral gutter. Replace portions that are damaged beyond repair with
matching materials
 Remove plywood from dormers and replace existing vents with new vents to match existing
(finish color green to match trim)
East Elevation
 Provide clear finish bird netting over arched opening at primary entry door
 Replace areas of deteriorated crown molding with FRP molding to match in detailing, color,
profile, and dimension
South Elevation
 Repair/reset existing damaged cornice
 At one second story window, replace upper light of sash and install a louvered vent (green finish to
match trim and window color)
 Remove existing canvas awning above first story entry door, and repair existing transom to include
the replacement of the glass
Rear Elevation
 Install a set of new paired doors at current 1st story opening (material not specified) and repair
surrounding masonry (color not specified)
 Replace existing steel fire escape with a new steel fire escape
 Install new vents as per the submitted elevation drawing
 Infill window openings as per the submitted elevation drawing
 Lengthen one 3rd-story window opening to accommodate a new hollow steel door (color not
specified)
 Repaint brick (color and method of cleaning not specified)
 

STAFF OBSERVATIONS AND RESEARCH
 The building’s exterior doors and windows are not historic age/were replaced ca. 2000
ISSUES
 None

RECOMMENDATION

 HDC staff recommeds that the Commission issue a Certificate of Appropriateness for the work as
proposed because it meets the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation, standard # 6)
Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration
requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color, texture,
and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features shall be
substantiated by documentary, physical, or pictorial evidence.

Re: HDC Submittal Info - Harmonie Club Building, 267 (aka 311) East Grand River Ave., Detroit, MI
Jennifer:
Please see the below information as requested.

Description of existing Conditions (including materials and design)
The building is currently vacant but was most recently used for restaurant space in the basement and gallery and
event space on floors one and two. The third floor performance space and stage are in poor condition and have
been unused for a significant length of time. The building is being renovated for restaurant and event space.
The following description includes info from the Local Historic District Report: Built in 1894 and designed by
Richard E. Raseman, Beaux Arts Style, (4) story hipped-roof, corner building with buff-colored brick and heavy,
over-scaled ornamental features typical of period. The raised lower level is of rusticated stone, the first and
second floors have horizontal brick bands and the third and fourth floors have raised brick pilasters running the
full two stories. There are brick panel details between the third and fourth floor windows. The two street
elevations are joined by an articulated, rounded corner. The third exposed elevation on the north fronts an alley,
and is common brick that has been painted. The structure across the alley has been demolished and the site is
now a parking lot.
In general the exterior is in good condition. None of the windows are original. They are green aluminum clad
wood. The alley has many bricked-in windows. A renovation into offices on the first and second floors (c.2000)
included the addition of an elevator accessed from a new double-door opening in the alley. The renovation also
included new interior walls, some built directly in front of windows so that the studs can be seen from the alley.
The renovation included new HVAC systems which are undersized for the proposed assembly uses of restaurant
and event spaces.
Description of project (why replacement rather than repair)
1. Because the current HVAC and electrical systems are undersized for the restaurant and event space assembly
uses, a new rooftop unit will be replacing the small unit which currently exists. See the view diagrams for
visibility from the r.o.w. The unit cannot be seen from the immediately surrounding r.o.w.s. It will be seen
across the parking lot from Madison, as can the existing unit.
2. Most of the existing smaller furnaces on each floor will remain or be relocated, but are not currently supplied
by fresh air, therefore new exterior grilles will be required, one on the south elevation. It is proposed to
replace the upper sash of the small window within the existing mechanical room. All other new openings we
were able to locate on the alley side, mostly within former window openings that had been bricked-in.

1435 Randolph, Suite 200, Detroit, MI 48226 / 313 964 0270 / 313 964 0170 fax / hamilton-anderson.com

 3. The existing egress from the 3rd floor assembly space is inadequate. The existing fire escape is only 2’ wide
and needed to be wider to accommodate the assembly occupant load. The existing fire escape is also within
10’ of non-rated windows which does not meet code. Therefore, a new, wider fire escape has been designed
to stay away from the existing windows with the exception of the windows that were covered by interior walls
anyway. These windows will be bricked-in. This allows for the windows within the prominent spaces (grand
stair and 3rd floor performance space) to remain.
4. A small piece of crown on the east elevation is deteriorated and will be replaced with FRP. See photo.
5. There is black bird netting, which is hardly visible, within the recess above the main entry. The netting is
necessary as evidenced by the bird-dropping within the recess. The netting will need to be removed when the
building and windows are cleaned. We are proposing to replace the netting with similar, black ¾” netting, just
as un-noticeable as the existing. See photos and product literature.
6. The green metal standing seam roof is faded and rusted in several locations. The roof will be replaced by a
standing seam roof, green to match the windows. The roof is not visible from the immediately surrounding
sidewalks, but can only be seen from a distance. We are proposing snow/ice clips due to existing icicle issues
directly over the public sidewalk.
7. The gutters and downspouts on the alley side will be replaced. The existing (4) downspouts are 4” diameter
fluted, painted to match the brick paint, and have been altered, or have missing pieces. They are not
connected to the underground storm sewer. The roof drainage has been calculated by our engineers and the
gutter and downspouts were found to be undersized. They need to be replaced due to corrosion and missing
pieces and tied into the storm sewer. We will be replacing the gutter with an 8” box gutter. Because of the
high cost of each sewer tie-in the (4) existing 4” downspouts will be replaced by (3) 6” fluted downspouts,
thereby eliminating a tie-in. The gutters and downspouts will be painted to match the new brick paint.

Harmonie Club Exterior Scope (beyond the items mentioned above)
Centre Street Elevation and Grand River Elevation:
1. Clean brick & limestone following HDC guidelines for Exterior Masonry Cleaning Techniques; repointing and
resealing to ensure a weather-tight facade
2. Repair metal and stone trim/details. Except for #4 above, no replacement is expected.
3. West end of south façade; Replace rusted and bent metal in existing openings to match existing
4. Windows had been previously replaced with clad wood windows. No new windows are proposed; however,
the lower level restaurant window glass will be replaced with clear glass and the lower level clear glass
window in an existing mechanical room will be replaced with frosted. The frosted glass windows appear to
have been clear at one time because there are clear glass panes stored in the basement which will be used.
See #3 above for alley windows.
5. No new signage (until tenant improvements)
6. Remove plywood from attic dormers and provide new louvers, finished green to match new roof
7. Repaint metal trim to match stone around entry (such as 2nd and 3rd floor cornices, brick pilaster capitals and
bases). This is a choice allowed by the color guide.

 8. “Colors” awning to be removed to expose the existing transom window.
9. Existing façade lighting to remain
10. Existing main entry handrail to remain

Alley Elevation:
1. Repaint alley side; color to be closer in color to the original brick
2. Repave alley
3. New alley opening for new service elevator access- double doors.
4. New alley doors at existing elevator?
5. Existing dumpster location is in the alley; location to remain
6. Egress lighting, mechanical platforms and penetrations to remain. Penetrations will be painted to match
the painted brick color.
