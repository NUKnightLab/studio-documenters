GENERAL BACKGROUND
The Chicago Housing Authority provides relocation services to families moving into the private
market with a Housing Choice Voucher or within CHA’s developments under the CHA’s Plan
for Transformation (“the Plan”). The current contracts to provide relocation services will expire
on March 31, 2010 and continued services for families impacted by the Plan are necessary.
On March 18, 2008, the Board of Commissioners authorized the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to enter into contracts with Big “O” Movers Storage, Inc., Smith Movers, Inc., REO
Movers and Van Lines, Inc., and Midway Moving and Storage, Inc. to provide moving services
in an amount of not-to-exceed $3,339,616 for a twenty-four month term with two (2) one-year
options, and also authorized a $439,616 contingency budget. In December 2009, CHA utilized a
portion of its board-authorized contingency funding to execute Amendment No. 1 with Midway
Moving and Storage, Inc. in an amount not to exceed $250,000 and with Reo Movers & Van
Lines, Inc. in an amount not to exceed $150,000. Amendment No. 1 with Reo Movers & Van
Lines also intended to extend the base term of contract from January 16, 2010 to March 31,
2010.
Each contractor has performed satisfactorily and met its contractual requirements during the base
term of the contracts, therefore it is in the best interest of CHA to exercise the first one-year
option for resident relocation moving services with Big “O” Movers and Storage, Inc., in the
amount of $325,000, Reo Movers and Storage, Inc., in the amount of $325,000, Smith Movers
Inc. in the amount of $325,000, Midway Moving and Storage, Inc., in the amount of $325,000,
and to authorize a contingency budget in the amount of $400,000 for a total amount not-toexceed $1,700,000 for all contracts. The maximum aggregate compensation amount for all of
the contracts combined is an amount not-to-exceed $5,039,616.
