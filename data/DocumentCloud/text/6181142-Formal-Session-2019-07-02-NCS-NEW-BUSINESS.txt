This will be our 4th year hosting the JDRF One Walk Detroit at Milliken State Parking and working with the City of

Detroit. Please note that Milliken State Park is a State of Michigan Park and we work directly with the park to
obtain special event permits required by the State of Michigan.

Due to it being a State of Michigan Park, in 2017 it was determined by the City of Detroit that we did not have to

obtain permits with the City of Detroit Building and Safety and the Fire Marshall Inspection was waived.
Supporting documentation can be provided upon request.

Dear Dr. Anderson:

On behalf of Detroit Pistons, I am writing to offer our full assistance in purchasing and
installing picnic tables and benches at the picnic pavilion and around the new basketball
court in Rouge Park. We will also be covering the cost and labor to perform brush
clearing along Plymouth Road, paint the picnic shelter, stripe the parking lot with new
parking lot lines, and plant trees along the basketball court and throughout the parking lot
islands. The costs, approximately $15,000, are being borne by the group mentioned
above.

These improvements will take place on Thursday, July 1 with prep work beginning
Monday, July 8. We have worked with community representatives to ensure these

improvements are desired.

The Detroit Pistons will be working with Detroit Diesel to check-in and water the trees
that are planted to ensure they are maintained post event.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
