 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 23, 2008
WHEREAS, the City of Chicago has developed a very successful Lights Out program in recent years,
encouraging the owners and managers of skyscrapers to reduce illumination during migration periods;
and
WHEREAS, in 2005 the City of Chicago and the Birds and Buildings Forum hosted the first-ever

WHEREAS, Cook County adopted the Green Buildings Ordinance in 2002, committing itself to

WHEREAS, bird-safe design features can be incorporated into new construction and major renovation
projects at no extra cost, and existing buildings may be made bird-safe through the use of simple, low cost
adaptations; and
WHEREAS, bird-safe practices often go hand-in-hand with energy efficiency improvements.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that Chapter
2 Administration, Article I, Section 2-6 (Building construction) of the Cook County Code is amended as
follows:
Sec. 2-6. Building construction.
(a)
In this section the term "Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)"
means a green building rating system promulgated by the United States Green Building Council
(USGBC) that provides specific principles and practices, some mandatory but the majority discretionary,
that may be applied during the design, construction, and operation phases, which enable the building to be
awarded points from reaching present standards of environmental efficiency so that it may achieve LEED
certification from the USGBC as a "green" building, as such rating system exists on November 7, 2002.
(b)
The County does hereby order the Department of Capital Planning and Policy to take the
steps necessary to assure that all newly constructed buildings and all buildings scheduled for capital
improvement are designed, built, and operated in accordance with the standards and requirements of the
LEED Green Building Rating System, Version 2.0, and does further order that each new building must
meet the requirements for LEED certification.
(c)
The USGBC intends to release a revised version of the LEED Green Building Rating
System every three years; and Cook County shall refer to the most current version of the LEED when
beginning a new building construction permit project or renovation.
(d)
With specific regard to the LEED Energy and Atmosphere category, because achieving
increasing levels of energy performance above the set energy code standards is the surest way of realizing
significant operational cost savings, all buildings shall set a goal to obtain a total of at least eight points in
this category.
(e)
The County also orders that LEED Existing Building rating system be used during
retrofit projects of its current standing structures and does further order that each retrofitted building shall
meet the requirements for LEED certification for existing buildings.
(f)
New construction and major renovation projects shall incorporate bird-safe building
materials and design features, including, but not limited to, those recommended by the City of Chicago’s
“Bird-Safe Building Design Guide for New Construction and Renovation,” the City of Toronto’s “BirdFriendly Development Guidelines,” and New York City Audubon’s “Bird-Safe Building Guidelines.”
(g)

The County shall make existing buildings bird-safe where practicable.

ANTHONY J. PERAICA, County Commissioner
PROPOSED ORDINANCE
An Ordinance providing for voter input with regards to any future
Cook County tax increases which exceed the rate of inflation or
consumer price index (CPI) adjustments.
WHEREAS, The County of Cook is a Home Rule unit and may, under the power granted by Section 6(a)
of Article VII of the 1970 Constitution of the State of Illinois, exercise any power and perform any
function pertaining to its government and affairs, including, but not limited to, the power to tax and to
incur debt; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board has recently voted to impose a $500 million tax increase upon the
residents of Cook County; and
WHEREAS, the amount of this tax increase is equal to roughly twice the amount of the actual county
deficit; and

5722

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 23, 2008
WHEREAS, this tax increase will result in Cook County having a sales tax of more than 10%, which will
result in many residents fleeing to other counties to make purchases; and
WHEREAS, the decision of whether to increase taxes by such a dramatic amount should be made by the
voters of Cook County.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the President and Board of Commissioners of the
County of Cook, Illinois, as follows:
ARTICLE I. DEFINITIONS
(a)
(b)
of Cook.

“Ballot issue” means a non-recall petition or referred measure in an election.
“County” means any the County of Cook, and includes any and all entities of the County

(c)
“Fiscal year spending” means all county expenditures and reserve increases except, as to
both, those for refunds made in the current or next fiscal year or those from gifts, federal funds,
collections for another government, pension contributions by employees and pension fund earnings,
reserve transfers or expenditures, damage awards, or property sales.
(d)
“Inflation” means the percentage change in the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics
Consumer Price Index for Cook County, all items, all urban consumers, or its successor index.
(e)
“Local growth” for the county means a net percentage change in actual value of all real
property in Cook County from construction of taxable real property improvements, minus destruction of
similar improvements, and additions to, minus deletions from, taxable real property.
ARTICLE II. SPENDING LIMITS
(a)
The maximum annual percentage change in the county’s fiscal year spending equals
inflation in the prior calendar year plus annual local growth, adjusted for revenue changes approved by
voters.
(b)
The maximum annual percentage change in the county’s property tax revenue equals
inflation in the prior calendar year plus annual local growth, adjusted for property tax revenue changes
approved by voters.
(c)
If revenue from sources not excluded from fiscal year spending exceeds these limits in
dollars for that fiscal year, the excess shall be refunded in the next fiscal year unless voters approve a
revenue change as an offset. Initial bases are current fiscal year spending and property tax collected in
that year. Qualification or disqualification as an enterprise shall change bases and future year limits.
Future creation of bonded debt shall increase, and retiring or refinancing county bonded debt shall lower,
fiscal year spending and property tax revenue by the annual debt service so funded. Debt service changes,
reductions, refunds, and voter-approved revenue changes are dollar amounts that are exceptions to, and
not part of, any county base. Voter-approved revenue changes do not require a tax rate change.

5723

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 23, 2008
ARTICLE III. EMERGENCY PROVISIONS

written comments filed with the Cook County Clerk by 45 days before the
election. No summary shall mention names of persons or private groups, nor any
endorsements of or resolutions against the proposal. Petition representatives
following these rules shall write this summary for their petition. The county clerk
officer shall maintain and accurately summarize all other relevant written
comments.

(d)
Except by later voter approval, if a tax increase or fiscal year spending exceeds any
estimate in (b) (iii) for the same fiscal year, the tax increase is thereafter reduced up to 100% in
proportion to the combined dollar excess, and the combined excess revenue refunded in the next fiscal
year. County bonded debt shall not issue on terms that could exceed its share of its maximum repayment

TAX INCREMENT FINANCE DISTRICT PUBLIC INFORMATION ORDINANCE
WHEREAS, a total of $800 million in property tax revenue was captured by tax increment finance (TIF)
districts in Cook County in 2006, including over $500 million in the City of Chicago alone; and

5725

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 23, 2008
WHEREAS, keeping the growth in property value in TIF districts (TIFs) off the tax rolls effectively
narrows the tax base and forces tax rates to be higher than they would otherwise need to be, leading to
higher tax bills for all property taxpayers in the County; and
WHEREAS, County tax bills identify those properties located in TIF districts, but do not indicate how
much in taxes from each property is distributed to the TIF district; and
WHEREAS, some parcels, including 77 West Wacker Drive in Chicago, the headquarters of United
Airlines, pay 100 percent of their property taxes to the TIF district in which they are located, even though
the amounts shown on the tax bill suggest that taxing districts such as the local school district, County,
and Forest Preserve District are receiving the revenue; and
WHEREAS, the Civic Federation issued a call in November 2007 for greater transparency in TIF
program finances; and
WHEREAS, the County Clerk has initiated an effort to provide the public with more information about
TIFs and has already produced user-friendly versions of the annual TIF distribution report and a web page
devoted to TIFs; and
WHEREAS, the 2007 1st installment tax bills informed taxpayers that TIF information is among the
information available on the County Clerk’s web-site; and
WHEREAS, Public Act 95-0227, signed into law by the Governor in August 2007, required the Illinois
Department of Revenue to conduct “a study to determine the feasibility for each county to include, on the
property tax bills for each taxpayer in that county, information concerning any tax increment financing
project that affects the taxpayer,” and to submit the study to the Governor and General Assembly by April
1, 2008; and
WHEREAS, County taxpayers deserve an accurate accounting of the distribution of their tax dollars to
TIF districts.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that Chapter
74 Taxation, Section 74-46, of the Cook County Code is hereby enacted as follows:
Sec. 74-46. Tax increment finance districts; public information and notification.
(a)

Definitions.

Act means the Tax Increment Allocation Redevelopment Act.
Tax increment finance or TIF means the process by which incremental property tax revenues in a
given area fund certain redevelopment project costs as defined in the Act.
Tax increment finance district or TIF district means redevelopment project area as defined in the
Act.
(b)
Property tax bills in Cook County shall include the following statement: “The use of tax
increment finance (TIF) by municipalities in Cook County may increase tax rates. For more information,
please visit the TIF section of the County Clerk’s website at http://www.cookctyclerk.com/[remainder of
URL to be determined]”

increment finance on real estate tax bills.
(d)
The Clerk and Treasurer, in conjunction with the County’s Department for Management
of Information Services (MIS), shall explore calculating and printing on tax bills the distribution per
parcel of property tax revenues to tax increment finance (TIF) districts.
The Clerk, Treasurer and MIS are to consider the feasibility of:
(1)

beginning in tax year 2008, including on first-installment tax bills a list of taxing
agencies and TIF districts and their respective property tax distribution
percentages for the previous tax year.

(2)

beginning in tax year 2009, including on second-installment tax bills for parcels
within TIFs the actual tax amounts to be distributed to the applicable TIF district,
with adjustments to the amounts for other agencies to reflect the TIF distribution
portion.

(e)
The Clerk and Treasurer are requested to submit to the Finance Committee of the Board
reports on or before January 1 and July 1 of each year describing progress on the changes to tax bills
described in (d)(1) and (d)(2) above and any obstacles to completion of these changes by the intended
dates.
(f)
The Clerk and Treasurer shall determine if and when the changes described in (d)(1) and
(d)(2) have been successfully incorporated into the property tax calculation, billing, and collection system
that they maintain. Upon such determination, the proposed changes shall become standard practice and
shall be applied to all County tax bills.
(g)
discontinued.

Upon successful implementation of (d)(2) above, the practice described in (d)(1) shall be

(h)
The Clerk shall request from the Comptroller of the State of Illinois a list of all
municipalities that have filed annual reports for their respective TIF districts with the Comptroller
pursuant to the Act. The Clerk shall maintain a list of municipalities on his website as described in

PROPOSED ORDINANCE
TAX INCREMENT FINANCE DISTRICT APPROVAL ORDINANCE
WHEREAS, the State of Illinois first authorized the creation of tax increment finance (TIF) districts in
1977, to encourage development in blighted areas by using the prospect of future growth to issue bonds in
order to jumpstart infrastructure and site improvements; and
WHEREAS, for the initial 23-year lifetime of a TIF district, Cook County and other taxing bodies
receive tax revenue only from the assessed value present in the district at its creation, known as the
baseline equalized assessed value, an amount which is not adjusted for inflation; and
WHEREAS, the use of TIF districts has grown exponentially in Cook County, increasing from seven in
1984 to 144 in 1994, 363 in 2004, and 415 in 2006; and
WHEREAS, a total of $800 million in property tax revenue was collected by tax increment finance (TIF)
districts in Cook County in 2006; and
WHEREAS, keeping the growth in property value in TIF districts off the tax rolls effectively narrows the
tax base and forces tax rates to be higher than they would otherwise need to be, leading to higher tax bills
for all property taxpayers in the County; and
WHEREAS, the establishment of a TIF district in a municipality in Cook County requires the approval
of a joint review board, on which the County holds only one seat, meaning that the County alone cannot
stop the creation of a TIF district to which it may be opposed; and
WHEREAS, certain other units of government which collect property taxes from the area contained
within a proposed TIF district, such as the Forest Preserve District of Cook County, are not members of
the joint review board and are therefore excluded from the decision-making process; and
WHEREAS, because the establishment of TIF districts restricts the future tax base, and therefore
significantly impacts the County’s budgetary and taxation policies, the Board should play a more active
role in the process governing the creation and modification of Cook County TIF districts.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that Chapter
74 Taxation, Section 74-45, of the Cook County Code is hereby enacted as follows:

5728

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 23, 2008

Sec. 74-45. Approval of proposed tax increment finance (TIF) districts.
(a) Upon receipt of any study or proposal pertaining to the creation, renewal, or extension of
any TIF district, the County’s joint review board representative shall transmit copies of said study or
proposal and date of the relevant joint review board meeting to the Board for referral to the Finance
Committee.
(b) The Board shall inform the County’s joint review board representative of its position on
each TIF proposal by means of a resolution. The County’s joint review board representative shall vote as
instructed by the Board.
(c) If the Board of Commissioners does not approve a resolution directing how the County’s
joint review board representative shall vote on any TIF proposal prior to the meeting of the joint review
board at which such TIF proposal will be considered, the County’s representative shall abstain from
voting.
Effective Date: This Ordinance shall take effect upon adoption.

BACK-TO-SCHOOL TAX HOLIDAY
BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that Chapter 74 Taxation, Article IV,
Section 74-152, of the Cook County Code is hereby enacted as follows:
ARTICLE IV. RETAILERS' OCCUPATION TAX
Sec. 74-152. Back-to-School tax holiday.
(a)
No tax is imposed under this Act upon the privilege of using, in this State, qualified
merchandise that is purchased at retail from a retailer if the qualified merchandise is purchased during the
holiday period.
(b)

For the purpose of this Section:

Holiday period means the period from 12:01 a.m. on the first Friday in August through midnight
of the Sunday follows 9 days later.

5729

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 23, 2008

Qualified merchandise means:
(1)

school supplies;

(2)

an article of clothing or footwear that is purchased for a selling price of $200 or
less; and

(3)

a computer that is purchased for a selling price of $3,000 or less.

Clothing or footwear means an article of apparel designed to be worn about the human body. The
term does not include accessories such as jewelry, handbags, purses, briefcases, luggage, wallets,
watches, and similar items that are carried on or about the human body, without regard to whether the
item is worn on the body in a manner that is characteristic of clothing.
Computer means a central processing unit for personal use plus any peripheral sold with it and
any computer software installed in it at the time of purchase. The term "computer” includes desktop
computers, laptop computers, hand-held computers, and personal digital assistants. The term “computer"
does not include any device designed primarily for video game applications. The term "peripheral"
includes any monitor, keyboard, printer, scanner, web/PC camera, microphone, external drive, network
card, internal drive, and additional storage.
School supplies means pens, pencils, erasers, crayons, notebooks, notebook filler paper, legal
pads, composition books, poster paper, scissors, cellophane tape, glue or paste, rulers, protractors,
compasses, calculators, and similar items commonly used by students for school purposes.
(c)
For the purpose of this Section, a "purchase" occurs during the tax holiday if the buyer
places an order and pays the purchase price by cash or credit during the tax holiday period regardless of
whether the delivery of the item occurs after the tax holiday period. An item of qualified merchandise
that is placed in a layaway or similar deferred plan during the holiday period is not eligible for the
exemption unless the item is delivered to the purchaser during the period. An item that was placed in a
layaway or similar deferred plan before the holiday period and is then delivered to the purchaser during
the holiday period is eligible for the exemption.
(d)
Any discount, coupon, or other credit offered either by the retailer or by a vendor of the
retailer to reduce the final price to the customer must be taken into account in determining the selling
price of the item for the purposes of this holiday. If the price of an item is free or reduced with the
purchase of another item, then the total price of the items may not be averaged in order for both items to
qualify for the holiday. The amount of any rebate may not be considered when determining the selling
price of the item for the purposes of this holiday.
(e)
Articles that are normally sold as a unit must continue to be sold in that manner; they may
not be priced separately and sold as individual items in order to be subject to the holiday. For example, if
a pair of shoes sells for $220, the pair cannot be split in order to sell each shoe for $110 to qualify for the
holiday. If a uniform is normally priced at $250 on a single price tag, the uniform cannot be split into
separate articles so that any of the components may be sold for less than $200 in order to qualify for the
holiday. Components that are normally priced as separate articles, however, may continue to be sold as
separate articles.

5730

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 23, 2008
(f)
Qualified merchandise that customers purchase during the holiday period with the use of
a rain check qualifies for the holiday regardless of when the rain check was issued. The issuance of a rain
check, however, during the holiday period does not qualify merchandise for the exemption if the
merchandise is actually purchased after the holiday period.
(g)
If a customer purchases an item of qualified merchandise during the holiday period but
later exchanges the item for a substantially similar item of a different size, different color, or other
feature, then no additional tax is due even if the exchange is made after the holiday period. If a customer
purchases an item of qualified merchandise during the holiday period, but after the holiday period has
ended, the customer returns the item and receives credit on the purchase of a different item, then the
newly purchased item is subject to the full tax rate. If a customer purchases an item of qualified
merchandise before the holiday period, but during the holiday period, the customer returns the item and
receives credit on the purchase of a different item of qualified merchandise, then the newly purchased
item is subject to the exemption.
Effective date. This Ordinance takes effect upon becoming law.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 23, 2008
Dr. Lubin-Johnson, seconded by Mr. Newton, moved that the Nominating Committee Members
vote to select ten (10) candidates for the first round of consideration. The motion carried. A show
of hands indicated eleven (11) yeas, two (2) nays, and one (1) member abstaining.
Dr. Lubin-Johnson, seconded by Mr. Scanlan, moved to adopt the nominating process as proposed
by Chairman Sewell. The motion carried unanimously.
PROPOSED NOMINATING PROCESS
1. Review the master list of nominees. If committee members are unfamiliar with or otherwise
interested in a nominee, the nominator will provide a brief introduction.
2. Consider “sub-categories” that reflect the scope of the Bureau’s health portfolio as follows:
a. Finance
b. Legal and Regulatory Affairs
c. Healthcare Management
i. Short stay hospital
ii. Long stay hospital
iii. Ambulatory specialty and sub-specialty care
iv. Community-based primary care
v. Mental health
vi. Forensic medicine/corrections
vii. Public health
d. Employee relations
i. Human resources/benefits
ii. Collective bargaining
iii. Labor
e. Public administration
f. Clinical Medicine
i. Graduate medical education
ii. Specialties
1. Prevention
2. Primary care
3. Specialty care
g. Other
3. Working individually, each committee member should select the top 10 nominees, regardless of
category.
4. A list of nominees with their frequency score (determined by giving a 1 for every appearance on a
committee member’s list) will be developed and placed in their nominated category. If a person
was nominated in more than one category, their name and frequency score will be listed in only
one category with a footnote identifying the other categories where they received nominations.
For these “multiple category” nominees, the total frequency score, regardless of category will be
reported.
5. The committee will determine the appropriateness of the top twenty persons by considering
frequency scores and balance across the categories.

Dr. Mason, seconded by Dr. Werner, moved to recess the Regular Session and convene into
Executive Session, pursuant to §120/2(C)(17) of the Open Meetings Act, 5 Ilcs 120/1, et seq., which
permits closed meetings for consideration of “the Recruitment … of Physicians or other Health
Care Professionals for a hospital, or other institution providing medical care, that is operated by
the Public Body”. The motion carried unanimously.
Mr. Balanoff, seconded by Mr. Newton, moved to recess the Executive Session and convene into
Regular Session. The motion carried unanimously.
Chairman Sewell recessed the meeting to Monday, April 7, 2008 at 9:00 A.M. in the Board Room, Room

April 7, 2008
The Nominating Committee of the Interim Board of Directors of the Cook County Bureau of Health
reconvened its recessed meeting at the hour of 9:00 A.M. on Monday, April 7, 2008. For the purpose of
considering the nomination and recommendation of candidates for the office of Director of the Interim
Board of Directors.
Chairman Sewell outlined the procedures that he expected to be used during the meeting. He stated that
the Committee would go into executive session, and would consider any other outside nominees not
already included on the original list of over sixty candidates. Next, the members would pick twenty
candidates, a tally would be calculated and the committee could come up with some priorities for
alternates.
Vice Chairman Goodman related his concerns with regard to diversity in choosing alternates to the
original twenty candidates sent to the President. If three candidates drop off whose primary experience is
skewed towards one area, going to the next group of five candidates according to frequency score may not
give diversity to the board.
Mr. Newton reminded the members that a tentative meeting date was set for Monday, April 14, 2008 at
1:00 P.M. The Committee could meet to consider replacements for the twenty candidates chosen, if
necessary.
Chairman Sewell confirmed that this process would be an alternative to having a list of prioritized
alternates.
Ms. Schaps, seconded by Secretary Giachello, moved that the group of proposed candidates who
received three (3) or more votes on Friday, April 4, 2008 and the four (4) additional candidates
receiving two (2) votes, Linda Coronado, Ladale George, Barbara Hillman and Jorge Ramirez,
totalling thirty (30), be interviewed by either the whole Nominating Committee or by a group of its
members prior to April 18, 2008. By a show of hands, there were two (2) yeas, seven (7) nays and
two (2) abstentions. The motion failed.
Dr. Lubin-Johnson, seconded by Vice Chairman Goodman, moved to recess the Regular Session
and convene into Executive Session, Pursuant to §120/2(C)(17) of the Open Meetings Act, 5 Ilcs
120/1, et seq., which permits Closed Meetings for consideration of “the Recruitment … of
Physicians or other Health Care Professionals for a hospital, or other institution providing medical

The Department requests your approval of the following Floodplain Ordinance Amendment. The Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) recently completed revisions to the countywide Flood
Insurance Study (FIS) and Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) for Cook County, Illinois and Incorporated
Areas. As a condition of its continued eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program, and in
accordance with Section 44 CFR 60.3(d) of the Code of Federal Regulations for the National Flood
Insurance Program (NFIP), Cook County is amending its current (November 2, 2000 as amended April 3,
2007) Floodplain Ordinance to reflect the following new FIRM effective date of August 19, 2008.
08-O-31
ORDINANCE

THE HONORABLE TODD H. STROGER
PRESIDENT OF THE COOK COUNTY BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS
FLOODPLAIN ORDINANCE AMENDMENT
BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that Chapter 106 Floodplains,
Section 106-2, of the Cook County Code is hereby amended as follows:
Sec. 106-2.

Definitions.

Designated floodway means the channel, including on-stream lakes, and that portion of the
floodplain adjacent to a stream or watercourse as designated by IDNR/OWR, which is needed to store and
convey the existing 100-year frequency flood discharge with no more than a 0.1 foot increase in stage due
to the loss of flood conveyance or storage, and no more than a ten percent increase in velocities.

5815

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 23, 2008
(1)

The floodways are designated on the Countywide flood insurance rate map for
Cook County number 17031C panels 64-69, 206 and 207 dated April 16, 2007,
panels 15, 20 and 155-158 dated November 16, 2006, panels 162, 164 and 166168 dated December 16, 2005, panels 366-369, 386, 388, 457 and 476 dated June
2, 2005, panels 169, 188, 307, 308, 309 and 330 dated February 4, 2004, panels
142, 144, 161, 163 and 305 dated December 20, 2002, and panels 38-63, 88-113,

477-832 dated November 6, 2000 August 19, 2008, prepared by FEMA.

(2)

To locate the designated floodway boundary on any site, the designated floodway
boundary should be scaled off the designated floodway map and located on a site
plan, using reference marks common to both maps. Where interpretation is
needed to determine the exact location of the designated floodway boundary,
IDNR/OWR should be contacted for the interpretation.

(3)

The terms designated floodway and "floodway" are synonymous for purposes of
this chapter.

Floodplain means that land typically adjacent to a body of water with ground surface elevations
at or below the base flood or the 100-year frequency flood elevation. Floodplains may also include
detached special flood hazard areas (SFHAs), ponding areas, etc. The floodplain is also known as the
special flood hazard area (SFHA). The floodplains are those lands within the jurisdiction of the County
that are subject to inundation by the base flood or 100-year frequency flood. The special flood hazard
areas (SFHA's) of the County are generally identified on the Countywide flood insurance rate map
(FIRM) for Cook County number 17031C, panels 64-69, 206 and 207 dated April 16, 2007, panels 15, 20

Contract period: September 20, 2008 through September 19, 2011. (897-365 Account). Requisition No.
88970406.
Approval of this item commits Fiscal Year 2008 and future year funds.
_________________________
Commissioner Daley, seconded by Commissioner Murphy, moved that the County Purchasing Agent be
authorized to advertise for bids. The motion carried unanimously.
CONTRACT RENEWAL
Transmitting a Communication from
JOHNNY C. BROWN, Chief Operating Officer, Stroger Hospital of Cook County
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to amend and renew Contract No. 04-42-267 with
Helena Laboratories, Beaumont, Texas, for the purchase of reagents and supplies for a vendor provided
serum protein immuno fixative electrophoreses (spife) analyzer and Cliniscan (Quikscan) 3 densitometer
for the Pathology Department, Division of Immunology.
Reason:

Helena Laboratories is the only known manufacturer and distributor of the spife analyzer and
the Cliniscan 3 densitometer. This is the only equipment which the analyzer separates and
stains visible serum protein and immuno fixatives by electrophoreses and the densitometer
performs up to sixty (60) patient samples in three (3) minutes or less. These tests diagnose
acute or chronic inflammatory conditions, albumn levels, paraproteinemia and other diseases.
The amendment is due to additional reagents and supplies for hemoglobin tests performed on
equipment owned by the hospital.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $114,240.00 ($57,120.00 per year). Contract period: May 1, 2008 through
April 30, 2010. (897-365 Account). Requisition No. 88970358.
