Core Measure-Venous
Thromboembolism (VTE) Prevention
Readmission Rate
Hospital Acquired Pressure Injuries

Measure Definition
Adults ages 18-75 with diabetes (type 1 or type 2) where HbA1c is in control (<8.0%).
Qualifying patients:
- Age 18-75 years as of December 31 of current year AND two diabetic Outpatient/ED visits in the current year or previous year
OR
-One diabetic Inpatient visit in the current year or previous year
OR
-Prescribed insulin or hypoglycemic or antihyperglycemics in the current year or previous year
Percentage of surgical patients aged 18 years and older undergoing procedures for which venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis is
indicated, who had an order for Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH), Low- Dose Unfractionated Heparin , adjusted-dose warfarin,
fondaparinux or mechanical prophylaxis to be given within 24 hours prior to incision time or within 24 hours after surgery end time
The readmission measures are estimates of unplanned readmission to an acute care hospital in the 30 days after discharge from a
hospitalization. Patients may have had an unplanned readmission for any reason.
A pressure injury is localized damage to the skin and underlying soft tissue usually over a bony prominence or related to a medical or
other device. Full thickness pressure injuries involve the epidermis and dermis, but also extend into deeper tissues (fat, fascia, muscle,
bone, tendon, etc.)

Press Ganey Patient Satisfaction Top
Box Score

The percentage of responses in the highest possible category for a question, section, or survey (e.g. percentage of ‘Very Good,’ or ‘Always’
Press Ganey
responses).
A percentile rank tells you where your score falls in relationship to other scores. Percentile rank for any given metric in any peer group is
determined by ordering all facilities’ scores from highest to lowest, then each score receives a percentile rank by determining the
Press Ganey
proportion of the database that falls below that score. For example, if your percentile rank is 30, you are scoring the same as or better
than 30% of the organizations you are compared to.
Includes two questions:

1.
How well the staff worked together to care for you.
2.
Likelihood of your recommending our practice to others.

• Verifying and documenting ILPMP website on each visit
• Prescribing small opioid quantities and frequent visits initially
• Obtaining opioids from a single pharmacy
• Performing urine drug testing when needed
• Documenting risk and functional improvement
• Avoiding the combination of sedatives and opioids
• Prescribing Naloxone for opioid prescriptions >50 MME
