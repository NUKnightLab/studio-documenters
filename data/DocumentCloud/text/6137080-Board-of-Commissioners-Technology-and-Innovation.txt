RECORDER OF DEEDS, Eugene “Gene” Moore, transmitting a Communication,
dated September 30, 2009:
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with
Fidlar Technologies, Inc., Rock Island, Illinois, for the property Fraud Alert system,
the Disaster Recovery System and the Tapestry/Laredo Data Sales program. The
Property Fraud Alert system will serve as an early notification for Cook County
property owners, allowing them to intervene in the event of fraudulent transactions.
The Disaster Recovery System will allow the office to resume operating within
hours of any interruption of service, whether natural or otherwise.
The
Tapestry/Laredo Data Sales program is expected to increase revenue from the
sale of Recorder of Deeds information beyond the current levels.
Reason:

Fidlar Technologies, Inc. provides the industry's only proactive land
fraud notification system that functions in harmony with third party
recording systems. The system requires no additional modifications to
existing Recorder of Deeds operation. The Fidlar Disaster Recovery
system feeds the Tapestry/Laredo Data Sales program with recorded
information, which provides an additional level of network security for
the Recorder of Deeds office.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $322,000.00 (FY 2009: $131,613.00; and FY 2010:
$190,387.00). Contract period: November 1, 2009 through October 31, 2010.
(527-260 Account). Requisition No. 95270035.
Sufficient funds are available in the Recorder of Deeds Document Storage Fund.
The Purchasing Agent concurs.
Vendor has met the Minority and Women Business Enterprise Ordinance.
