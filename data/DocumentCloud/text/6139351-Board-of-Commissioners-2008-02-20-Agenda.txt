LETTER
Transmitting a Communication, dated February 20, 2008 from
PETER N. SILVESTRI, County Commissioner and
Chairman, Litigation Subcommittee
This letter is to advise you of a recommendation of the Litigation Subcommittee to repeal the
Cook County Displaced Building Service Workers Protection Ordinance.
Pursuant to a recommendation of the United States District Court, the subcommittee was asked to
consider modification or repeal of the ordinance. The majority of the subcommittee voted to
recommend repeal, upon analysis by the State’s Attorney’s office that modification would be so
extensive as to basically make the ordinance ineffective.
The Court has ordered that the State’s Attorney’s office inform the Court of the Board’s decision
tomorrow, February 21, 2008. Therefore, we must act on this issue today.

BUREAU OF HEALTH SERVICES
GRANT AWARD
ITEM #6
APPROVED AS AMENDED
Transmitting a Communication, dated February 13, 2008 from
ROBERT R. SIMON, M.D., Interim Chief, Bureau of Health Services
The Cook County Bureau of Health Services with the Hektoen Institute of Medicine is hereby requesting
authorization to accept a grant in the amount of $100,000.00 from the Heinz Family Philanthropies
(Heinz Family Philanthropies, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America and Abbott
Laboratories) to provide health care services to uninsured and underinsured children and adults at two of
the Cook County Bureau of Health Services Ambulatory & Community Health Network Clinics,
(“ACHN”) the Logan Square Health Center located in the City of Chicago and the Cicero Health Center
located in Cicero.
The Heinz Family Philanthropies’ grant is designed to provide an affordable health care home for
uninsured and underinsured children and adults at the ACHN Logan Square and Cicero Health Centers
who normally do not take advantage of the County’s primary care services. This grant will initiate the
“Chicago/Cook County Everyone Matters” program that will allow a focus on primary care and
preventive measures aimed at keeping minor illnesses from becoming expensive and life threatening
emergencies. This unique project and grant will fund an Outreach Worker who will work with both
clinics to be a voice in the community to explain how this program will work and secure new patients for
primary health care services at the Logan Square and Cicero Health Centers. In addition to funding the
Outreach Worker, this grant will fund approximately 1,000 primary care visits by new patients enrolled
into the “Chicago/Cook County Everyone Matters” program.
This grant does not require an application process and will be managed by the Hektoen Institute of
Medicine.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: None. Grant Award: $100,000.00. Funding period: March 1, 2008 through
February 28, 2009.
PERMISSION TO ADVERTISE
ITEM #7
APPROVED
Transmitting a Communication from
ROBERT R. SIMON, M.D., Interim Chief, Bureau of Health Services
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to advertise for bids for transcription services for Oak
Forest Hospital of Cook County, Provident Hospital of Cook County and Stroger Hospital of Cook
County. This service is necessary since it has reached a crisis point with a backlog of 2500 radiology
reports not transcribed at Provident Hospital of Cook County.
Contract period: July 1, 2008 through June 30, 2011. (891-260, 897-260 and 898-260 Accounts).
Requisition Nos. 88910051, 88970292 and 88980147.
Approval of this item would commit Fiscal Year 2008 and future year funds.

BUREAU OF HEALTH SERVICES
CONTRACT
ITEM #8
APPROVED
COMMISSIONER MORENO VOTED “PRESENT”.
Transmitting a Communication from
ROBERT R. SIMON, M.D., Interim Chief, Bureau of Health Services
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into and execute a contract with Sav-Rx
Chicago, Inc., Chicago, Illinois, for the pharmacy mail order refill prescription services, which includes
emergency services for over-flow, non-mailed refilled prescriptions, for the Bureau of Health Services.
Reason:

A Request for Proposal (RFP) was issued and Sav-Rx Chicago, Inc. was the only responder and
it was determined that they met the requirements of the RFP and the Minority and Women
Owned Business Enterprises. As a result, the bureau is recommending the award to Sav-Rx
Chicago, Inc.
The current contract with Sav-Rx Chicago, Inc. has over 40 contracted employees and the
bureau does not have the pharmacy staff to provide for this operation which includes telephone
operators and a call center in Nevada to handle overflow and extended hour responses for the
patients. The mail order pharmacy is currently filling an average of 4000 prescriptions each
day with an additional 1100 refills per day for Stroger Hospital of Cook County, Provident
Hospital of Cook County and Fantus Health Center pharmacies. The Bureau of Health Services
will save approximately $1,600,000.00 with the new contract.
This item should proceed for board approval because, if the new contract is not approved or the
existing contract not extended beyond the February 29, 2008 expiration date, the mail order
pharmacy operations would have to be assumed by the bureau.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $30,680,000.00 (Years 1 and 2 – $10,226,666.67; and Year 3 –
$10,226,666.66). Contract period: March 1, 2008 through February 28, 2011. (890-260 Account).
Requisition No. 88900164.
Approval of this item would commit Fiscal Year 2008 and future year funds.

CONTRACT ADDENDUM continued
ITEM #13 cont’d
Reason:

This request is necessary to maintain testing of patients’ samples for blood chemistry analysis
during the reorganization of the current laboratory services into a bureau-wide consolidated
laboratory. The bureau-wide laboratory consolidation will achieve economies of scale. The
process to develop new specifications requires additional time than anticipated since a
detailed assessment of each facility is necessary for the coordination of specifications into one
document. Moreover, this time will enable the laboratory to perform necessary correlation
studies which are required by regulatory agencies to insure that the existing and the new
instrumentation provide accurate correlated test results. The expiration date of the current
contract is February 29, 2008.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $81,500.00. Contract extension: March 1, 2008 through August 31, 2009.
