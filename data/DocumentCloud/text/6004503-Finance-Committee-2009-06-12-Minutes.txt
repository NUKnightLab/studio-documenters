Purchase Order Number 165615-000 with Allied Health Professionals
was issued for the provision of Speech-Language Pathologist services in the
amount of $24,924.00.

Authorization is requested to increase in the amount of $48,240.00 the current
purchase order because Speech Therapy positions are very dif?cult to fill due to
an overall market shortage of these professions. In addition to the rising
shortage of therapists in these professions, there has been a dramatic increase in
salaries over the past several years, with which the County has not kept pace. In
a very competitive market, our salaries are not competitive for new graduates
and much less so for experienced positions. At the present time there are
approximately 10 12 inpatient referrals daily, the Director and Assistant
Director complete evaluations but do not perform treatments or provide patient
therapy.

Provide Medicaid enrollment services for self-pay patients receiving medical
care at Cook County Health and Hospitals System. Services include claims
submission to the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services as

Justification:

The eligibility vendor's original # 06-41-591 with effective dates from 7/1/2006­
6/30/2009 has a purchase order maximum payable of $1.8m. Business needs
required executive management to direct the referral of several special projects
to the vendor as a result of a severe MANG unit backlog which would have
resulted in multi-million dollar losses to CCHHS if left unresolved. GLM was
assigned all pending Medicaid accounts aged 61 days and older with a value of
approximately $42m. Consequently, the vendor's eligibility enrollment work
resulted in additional revenue as well as unbudgeted vendor fees. Based on the
increased referral volume GLM depleted available PO funds prior to the end of
their contract date of 6/30/2009.
The total amount generated for Stroger Hospital in 2008 was $7,165,382.00
The total amount generated for the Stroger Special Project accounts in 2008
was an additional $6,563.768.00. Special Project referral occurred in July 2007.

Provide Medicaid enrollment services for self-pay patients receiving medical
care at Cook County Health and Hospitals System. Services include claims
submission to the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services as
well.

Justification:  

The eligibility vendor's original contract # 06-41-588, with effective dates from
7/1/2006-6/30/2009, is set to expire prior to implementation of the re-designed
Financial Counseling services model approved by the CCHHS governing board.
The original purchase order has a maximum payable of one million four hundred
twenty-five thousand ($1,425,000) dollars and will not be sufficient through
9/30/2009. The re-designed process is expected to be in place by 9/30/2009,
and therefore requires a contract extension as well as an increase in the original
PO of an additional one million one hundred thousand ($1,100,000) dollars.

Respectfully requesting authority to terminate the Lease Agreement entered into by and between
Chicago Title Land Trust Company as successor trustee and Ralph Edgar ("Landlord") and the
County of Cook ("Tenant") for space located at 64 W. 162nd Street, South Holland, Illinois
which is utilized by the Cook County Department of Public Health as a public health dental
center.
The Cook County Board of Commissioners ("Board") approved a First Amendment to Lease
which provided for the operation of the dental center February 15, 2005. On March 20, 2009,
the Finance Committee of the Board of Directors of the Cook County Health and Hospitals
System approved a Second Amendment to the Lease further extending the term of this Lease
through January 31,2014.
CCDPH has communicated to this Office that it will be relocating CCDPH staff currently
assigned to this location and that a non-governmental provider will operate a federally qualified
health center (FQHC), which will include dental services, at this location in the future. This
arrangement requires that the CCDPH transfer certain furnishings and equipment some of which
is affixed to the premises (see related agenda item CCDPH Item #2). Under these circumstances,
the landlord is willing to waive the 180 day written notice requirement for termination of this
Lease and allow the County to terminate the Lease as of June 30, 2009.
Termination of said Lease will save the County approximately $360,000.00 in future rent
payments. The Real Estate Management Division will send the required written notice for
termination within ten (10) days of Board approval.
Approval is recommended.
