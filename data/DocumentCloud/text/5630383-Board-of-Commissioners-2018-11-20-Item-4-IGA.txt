Modification Fund (“Mod Fund” or “Fund”), in the amount of $92,000 each year at the discretion

 Background
In 1999, CHA created a Modification Fund, which consists of a pool of money set‐aside for the
construction and installation of accessibility features and devices like grab bars, lifts, ramps, and
sensory equipment, for HCV participants who need such features to utilize their vouchers in the
private market.
In order to successfully implement such a program, CHA sought to find an entity that possessed
expert knowledge in accessibility modifications and employed staff that was capable of
overseeing on‐site modification work in private units throughout the City of Chicago.
Additionally, the entity had to be able to: develop a methodology to administer the Mod Fund;
intake and analyze accessibility applications; perform a physical assessment of the proposed
unit/building to undergo modification; subcontract with construction firms to provide the actual
modifications; subcontract with companies to provide accessibility supplies; and provide on‐site
quality control. The Housing Rights and Nondiscrimination Department found that MOPD, a
governmental organization created solely to assist persons with disabilities, is capable of
providing all the necessary services with the required degree of skill and knowledge with the
benefit of no administration fee to CHA.
MOPD’s HomeMod program is in line with the goals the CHA has established with its Modification
Fund. MOPD has experienced staff who administer the HomeMod program and the types of
modifications made under the HomeMod program include kitchen and bathroom modifications,
and the addition of interior and exterior lifts and ramps. MOPD has its own eligibility
requirements; however, they have agreed to implement CHA’s eligibility requirements with the
funding provided by CHA for its Modification Fund. MOPD’s HomeMOD program receives federal
funding therefore, MOPD must abide by all federal rules and regulations. Furthermore, MOPD
has agreed to provide the aforementioned services at no administrative cost to CHA.
CHA’s previous IGA was authorized by the Board on February 17, 2015 for $92,000.00 for onebased year and four on-e year options for a total of $460,000.00.
