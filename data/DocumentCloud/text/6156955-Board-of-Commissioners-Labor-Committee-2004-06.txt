Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Finance Labor Subcommittee of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County met pursuant
to notice on Tuesday, June 15, 2004 at the hour of 2:00 PM in the Board Room, Room 569, County
Building, 118 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois.
Your Subcommittee has considered the following item and upon adoption of this report, the
recommendations are as follows:

265627

AMENDMENT TO THE COOK COUNTY LIVING WAGE ORDINANCE (PROPOSED
ORDINANCE AMENDMENT).
Submitting a Proposed Ordinance Amendment
sponsored by Roberto Maldonado and John P. Daley, County Commissioners. CoSponsored by Bobbie L. Steele, Mike Quigley and Larry Suffredin, County
Commissioners.
requesting authorization to amend to the “Cook County Living Wage Ordinance” (98O-21), approved by the Board on September 15, 1998, for your approval. This item
will be introduced at the May 18, 2004 Board meeting and I will request that it be
referred to the Finance Labor Subcommittee for further review and discussion.
Similar to the City of Chicago’s Living Wage Ordinance (Title 2, Chapter 92, Section
610), the proposed amendment increases the living wage for lowest-wage individuals
employed by contractors or subcontractors doing business with Cook County. The
county’s current living wage of $7.60 per hour will be increased to $9.43 per hour if
health benefits are provided, or $10.68 per hour with no health benefits. There will be
an annual adjustment calculated as 100% of the federal poverty line for a family of
four (as defined by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services) with health
benefits and 125% of the federal poverty line for a family of four without health
benefits.

In addition, the proposed amendment applies to companies benefiting from property
tax incentives as set forth in the Cook County Real Property Assessment
Classification Ordinance.
These amendments will ensure fair wages and will contribute to the county’s overall
economic well-being.
The following is a synopsis of the Proposed Ordinance Amendment.
PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT
COOK COUNTY LIVING WAGE ORDINANCE
WHEREAS, on September 15, 1998, the Cook County Board of Commissioners
passed the County Living Wage Ordinance to establish meaningful employee
compensation for lowest-wage individuals employed by a person or business entity
awarded a contract or subcontract with Cook County; and
WHEREAS, Cook County’s Living Wage Ordinance should be updated to reflect the
most recent federal poverty level standards to maintain a stable and productive work
force thereby stimulating the local economy; and
WHEREAS, companies that benefit from property tax incentives from Cook County
should be held to the same living wage standard as those companies who do
business with Cook County to ensure a fair wage for their employees and to contribute
to the County’s overall economic well-being; now, therefore,
BE IT ORDAINED BY THE PRESIDENT AND THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS
OF THE COUNTY OF COOK:
The Cook County Living Wage Ordinance (98-O-21) is hereby amended by deleting
the language stricken and by inserting the underlined language as follows:
Section 1. Living Wage Requirements.
Section 2. Applicability.
Section 3. Effective Date.
*Referred to Committee on Finance Labor Subcommittee on 5/18/04.
Commissioner Maldonado stated that the essence of the Living Wage Ordinance is that it requires
contractors, subcontractors and anyone who receives a Cook County tax incentive to pay their
employees a living wage of $9.43 per hour if the employees receive health insurance or $10.68 if they
do not receive health insurance. To determine these figures, the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services’ poverty guidelines were used. For a family of four to live above poverty they must
earn an income of $18,850 per year, which translates to $9.43 per hour. One new provision is that
businesses that seek tax cuts from Cook County must adhere to the Living Wage. He stated that one
employer received $5 million in tax breaks. He stated that nine new counties and cities have adopted a
living wage requirement of their contractors, subcontractors and of those who receive tax breaks.

Chairman Murphy noted that $7.60 per hour converts to $304 per week, or $1216 per month. The average
monthly rent is between $850 and $1,000 per month. This cannot support a family. Further, she does not
believe in trickle-down economics, rather, she believes the economy has to be standardized from the bottom
up. Higher pay stimulates the economy through purchasing power. She stated that she is very much in
favor of the ordinance. She noted that one of the tragedies of low wages is that people have to work several
jobs and they do not have time to spend with their families. Only the high middle class can afford to have
only one person working.
Vice Chairman Moreno, seconded by Commissioner Butler Maldonado, moved the approval of
Communication Nos. 265627 subject to it being amended regarding the different classifications
of the tax incentive program. The motion carried. Commissioner Gorman voted no.
Commissioner Gorman moved to adjourn the meeting, seconded by Vice Chairman Moreno.
The motion carried and the meeting was adjourned.

Respectfully submitted,
Finance Labor Subcommittee
