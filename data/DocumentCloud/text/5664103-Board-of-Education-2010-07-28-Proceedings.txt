The hearing officer has submitted a written report to the CEO summarizing all relevant evidence offered

principal of White.

Ill. Chief Executive Officer's Recommendation

The CEO has reviewed the Hearing Officer's findings of fact and recommendation and hereby
recommends that Sharon Jenkins be removed and replaced as the principal of White effective July 30.
2010. The CEO further recommends that Sharon Jenkins" Uniform Principal's Performance Contract. with
a term beginning July 1. 2008. and ending June 30. 2012. be terminated effective July 30. 2010 These
recommendations are based upon the following factors:

A. Edward White Elementary Career Academy has a history of poor academic performance and has
been on academic probation for the past 2 school years. including the 2009-2010 school year
Mrs. Jenkins has served as principal of Edward White Elementary Career Academy Since 2008

B. Edward White Elementary Career Academy has low academic performance across subiect areas
and is not making significant progress to catch up to the District's gains.

C. Starting in 2008. CPS began using a new metric to measure student growth from year to year on
the ISAT. This metric, called the Value-Added metric, which is a component of the CPS
Performance Policy. compares student academic growth at a school with the growth of 
students across the District. This is done through a regression methodology that controls for eight
student-level factors. including grade level. prior performance on the ISAT, free or reduced lunch
eligibility. mobility. participation in the Homeless Education Program. Individualized Education
Plan (or English Language Learner status. and gender. Controlling for these factors allows
the district to see how much impact the school had on its average student over the past year
Because we control for prior performance. this metric allows us to identify schools with low test
scores where growth is rapid. and schools with high test scores where growth is slow

in understanding this metric. a positive number means that students at the school are growing at

a faster pace than similar students in the District. For example. a positive 1 means that students
at the school grew. on average. one scale score point more than Similar students. A score near
zero means that students at the school are growing at about the same pace as similar students in
the District. And a negative score means that students at the school are growing at a slower
pace than similar students in the District.

White's 2009 reading Value~Added score was -6.3 and its mathematics Value-Added score was
This means that on average between 2008 and 2009. students at White grew 6 3 scale
score points less in reading and 7 ISAT scale score pomts less in mathematics than Similar
students in the District. As a point of reference. Out of 521 schools in the District in 2009. White's
reading score was the second lowest. and its mathematics score was the third lowest score

14

July 28, 2010

D. Ms. Jenkins was unable to ensure that White Elementary Career Academy successfully
implemented special education services. It is the CEO and his Judgment that new
leadership is necessary at Edward White Elementary Career Academy to ensure that high quality
special education services are in place moving forward, and to guide staff in furthering their
deveIOpment in Servicing students disabilities.

If the Board adopts the CEO's recommendation to remove the White principal. the foilowmg actions will

THE STUDENT CODE OF CONDUCT
Effective September?1W? September 15, 2010

BOARD OF EDUCATION OF THE CITY OF CHICAGO
POLICY STATEMENT

The Board of Education of the City of Chicago ("Board"). the governing body 01 the Chicago Public
Schools, is responsible for establishing policies under which schools operate. To promote desirable
student conduct and behavior. the Board has adapted the Student Code of Conduct or 'Code')

The SCC is consistent with lliinois School Code. the Rules of the Board of Education of the City of
Chicago. negotiated agreements with employee groups. and all other applicable state and federal laws

This Code recognizes that the Chicago Public Schools has the responsibility to ensure that the school
environment is safe for all students and school personnel and that it is important to provide students with
a consistent set of expectations for behavior The Board expects all students to respect the rights of
fellow students. personnel and others. and to behave in a manner that does not violate school rules.
procedures. Board policy or the law. Students shall be encouraged to seek assmtance from school
personnel to prevent or resolve conflicts and to report incidents or activities that may threaten or disrupt
the educational environment. The SCC requires all students enrolled in the Chicago Public Schools to
accept responsibility and the appropriate consequences for their actions and behavior

To ensure that disciplinary matters are handled elm and parents are notified of inappropriate

behavi arents/ uardians shalt rom tl noti th lof ch set address hone numbers

Schools are also encouraged to establish a team to school of?crals With the development or local
school regulations. provided those regulations do not conflict With the SCC. A positive and sale sch00l
climate significantly contributes to student academic achievement. The Board strongly encOurages
schools to establish measures designed to foster incrdent avordance Where possible. schools should

PURPOSE AND GOALS

Through the establishment of the SCC. the Board seeks to (1) create a consistent set of expectations for
student behawor for the Chicago Public Schools system and all students. (2) outline the interventions and
consequences for students who engage in inappropriate behaVior; and (3) reinforce posnlve behavior and
provide students with opportunities to develop appropriate behaworal skills.

OF STUDENT CODE OF CONDUCT

The SCC is not intended to address the entire spectrum of student misbehawor that may occw at school
or on school property. Instead, the SCC outlines a range of appropriate responses for certain
inappropriate behaviors. Local school offiCIals retain the discretion to address student misconduct that is
not speci?cally included in the SCC. However, poor academic achievement is not considered an act of
misconduct. Therefore. the SCC may not be used to discipline students for poor academic progress or
failure to complete assignments. Similarly, students must not be disciplined based totally or in part on the
refusal of a student's parent or guardian to administer or consent to the administration of medication to
the student.

 

The SCC applies to all students. However. discipline for students with disabilities must be administered in
accordance With the procedures set forth in Appendix E,

The SCC applies to actions of students during school hours. before and after school. while on school
property. while traveling on vehicles funded by the Board. at all school-sponsored events. and while using
the CPS Network or any computer; at Information Technology Devices. or sogial networking w8b?lte
when the actions affect the mission or operation of the Chicago Public Schools. Students may also be
subject to discipline for Group 5 or 6 Inappropriate Behaviors that occur either off campus or during non-
school hours. including actions that involve the pee of any computer. Informationjachnolcgv Device pr
social networking website. when the misconduct disrupts or may disrupt the orderly educational process
in the Chicago Public Schools

Students who are suspended or expelled from school may not in extracmriCular activities or
school-sponsored events during the period of the suspensron or expulsmn, However. students On
suspension during the administration of state assessments shall be provided an opportunity to enter the
school for the purpose of taking the test and may be allowed to participate in related test preparatiOn
activities, upon approval by the Chief Area Officer. Students are SUBJECI to the requirements and
obligations set out in the Policy on Student Acceptable Use of the CPS Netiivork
pdf). For violations of the SCC that involve improper use of
Information Technology Devices. the student may be subject to discipline pursuant to the SCC. in addition
to having his/her network privileges suspended,

The SCC provides a variety of interventions and consecuences to address student misconduct that range
from the least severe to expulsion. Before any intervention or consequence is iSSued. school officials shall
consider all mitigating circumstances and shall ensure that the student receives due process Mitigating
Circumstances include. but are not limited to. the following factors.

0 the student's age. health. maturity. and academic placement;

- the student's prior conduct and record of behavior;

. the student's attitude:

0 the level of parentlguardian cooperation andfor involvement.

I the student's willingness to make restitution;

the seriousness of the offense; and

- the student?s willingness to enroll in a student assistance program

Moreover. the following require special application of the 
Agg Appropriate Diegigline

The Board recognizes that students of different grades and ages are at different developmental levels
thus their behavior will be different and may call for different responses In determining the appropriate
level of interventions and consequences, in addition to mitigating circumstances school officials should
consider the grade level and age of the student. This approach may result in a less severe intervention
and consequence for a lower grade or younger student as compared to a higher grade or older student

The SCC does not apply to students attending pre-kindergarten and kindergarten and strict application of
the Code to pre-kindergarten and kindergarten students is prohibited. School officials may refer to the
SCC as a guide and may exercise discretion to issue appropriate interventions and consequences for
students in pro-kindergarten or kindergarten who engage in inappropriate behavior However any
decision to suspend. expel or reassign a pro-kindergarten or kindergarten student must be reviewed and
approved by the appropriate Chief Area Officer_ - and Bgstoratiye Juetlce and the SCC

The Code also reflects alternative approaches to classroom management and student discipline
Speci?cally, the Board recognizes and embraces the philosophy of restorative justice. Restorative justice
principles involve those who have a stake in a specific offense in collectively identifying and addressing
the harm done and the needs and obligations of all involved in order to heal and correct the situation as
fuIIy as possible. The Board encourages principals and administrators to adopt and implement restorative

39

July 28, 2010

July 28, 2010

justice philosophies and practices as additional tools to address student misconduct When restorative
justice practices are available and adequate and when all parties voluntarily embrace and partiCipate in
restorative justice practices. these practices ShOuld be utilized as Outlined in the SCC For a list of
examples of restorative practices please see Appendix in the Appendix of this policy

POLICE FICATION

When certain misconduct by a student amounts to a criminal act or poses danger to the health. safety or
welfare of other students and staff at a school. it may be necessary and appropriate to contact the
Chicago Police Department (CPD) and to seek their assistance The inappropriate behawors that require
a school official to notify the CPD are identified thr0ughout the SCC by the placement of an asterisk 
preceding the speci?c inappropriate behavior. If a student engages in Such behavior. a school offiCial
must contact the CPD. Whenever the school notifies the police concerning student misconduct. the
school must also immediately attempt to contact the parent/guardian of that student If questions arise
concerning police noti?cation, please consult the appropriate Area Office or the Law Department at (773)
553-1700.

However. there are other inappropriate behaviors by students where it is necessary for a school offiCial to
assess the nature of the misconduct and the extent to which the health. safety or welfare of other persons
are placed in danger by a student's actions. In those instances. school offiCials must make a iudgment
call as to whether contacting CPD is appropriate. To assist school officials in making this determination
the inappropriate behaviors preceded by double asterisks are those the SCC considers possible
violations of criminal law. depending on the specific facts and circumstances, and may require police
notification. School officials should consider whether the misconduct is partiCularly egregiOus andlor the
student persists in misconduct after being told to cease such behaVior and continues to endanger the
health. safety or welfare of others.

The discretionary exercise of a school officials authority to notify the CPD should involve the
consideration of a variety of factors Those factors include. but are not limited to

The age of the student engaging in misconduct:

The extent to which the student acted intentionally or recklessly;

- Whether the student has received prior warnings; and

0 Whether the student?s misconduct is specifically intended to cause others physical harm or
endanger the health. safety or welfare of others.

If a school official has any questions regarding the decision of whether to notify the police. he or she
should contact the appropriate Area Office or. if necessary. the Law Department, as soon as possible and
before notifying the police. However. at no time should the safety of students andror staff be
compromised to adhere to this provision of the SCC,

procedural safeguards. Saturday. and before- and after-school detentions do not count toward the
10-day limit. Additionally. as-ieng?as if students with disabilities are being provided with special education
services. in-school suspensions do not count towards the 10-day limit. Principals dew are not
reggired to suspend students with disabilities for the mandatory periods set forth in this Code for a single
offense. The Principal has discretion to be flexible in the amount of days of suspension given to students
with disabilities. Students with disabilities can be suspended in excess of 10 school days in certain
circumstances. In order to suspend a student with a disability in excess of 10 school days. the
Office of Due Process and Mediation at (773) 553-1905 MUST first be consulted for approval.

Students with disabilities. even if expelled. must be prowded with an apprOpriate education in an
alternative educational setting.

Federal regulations offer some flexibility in suspending students with disabilities in excess of 10 schoor
days in the school year in certain circumstances. In order to determine whether the cirCumstances permit
a suspension in excess of 10 days per sshooi year, consultation by the school with the Office of Due
Process and Mediation (773-553-1905) is absolutely necessary. Without such consultation and

BALANCED AND RESTORATIVE JUSTICE 

Following is a listing of generally accepted balanced and restorative Justice strategies Balanced and
restorative justice strategies may be used at the discretion of the in lieu of certain other non-
Group 5 or 6 interventions set forth in the SCC. when all parties voluntarily agree to participate and the
appropriate resources are available to support a meaningful effort These strategies may also be used in
conjunction with other interventions. This list is not exhaustive of all balanced and restorative Justice
strategies.

Circles
(Also called Peacemaking Circles. Circles of Understanding)

Circles - sometimes called peacemaking Circles - use traditional circle ritual and structure to involve the
victim. victim supporters. the offender. offender Supporters. police. and all interested community
members. Within the circle. people can speak from the heart in a shared search for understanding or the
event. and together identify the steps necessary to assist in healing all affected parties and prevent future
offenses.

Circles typically involve a multi-step procedure that (1) application by the offender to participate
in the circle process; (2) a healing circle for the victim; (3) a healing circle for the offender. (4) a mole to
develop consensus on the elements of a healing plan; and (5) follow-up circles to monitor the progress of
the offender. The healing plan may incorporate commitments by the school. community. and family
members, as well as by the offender. Specifics of the circle process vary from community to community
and are designed locally to fit community needs and culture. Circles also may be used in schools to
improve school culture and build relationships.

Goals
The goals of circles include:

. Promote healing for all affected parties

. Provide an opportunity for the offender to make amends

Empower victims. community members, families. and offenders by giving them a veice and a
shared responsibility in finding constructive resolutions

. Address the underlying causes of offense behavior
- Build a sense of community and its capacity for resolving conflict
Promote and share community values
. improve school culture
Implementation

A successful circle process depends upon a healthy partnership between the school and the community
Participants from both need training and skill building in the circle process. peacemaking. and consensus
building. The school can subsequently customize the circle process to fit local rescurces and culture

Circles are not appropriate for all offenses. The connection of the offender to the community. the smcenty
and nature of the offender's efforts to be healed. the input of victims. and the dedication of the offenders
support group are key factors in determining whether a case is appropriate for the process

Community Service

Community service is work performed by an offender for the benefit of the school community as a formal
or informal sanction. Just as neighborhoods and school communities are harmed by criminal and
delinquent activities. they can be at least partially restored by meaningful servrce that contributes to their
improvement. Community service offers one way an offender can be held accOuntable to repair seme of
the harm caused by his or her criminal or delinquent actions.

Goals
The goals of community service are to:

. Hold offenders accountable for the harm they have caused to the school community

. Provide school communities with human resources that can in maintaining a posnive
school climate

. Allow victims a voice and occasionally some direct benefit by recommending the type of
community service performed

60

July 28, 2010

Implementation

Successful community service programs require a true partnership Offenders in a school community can
enhance efforts of the community by prowding meaningful contributions Examples of community service
include: programs that beautify a community's environment such as cleanup efforts or graffiti removal
Truly restorative community service offers crime victims the opportunity to prowde input into the types of
community service they would like to see the offender perform. including activities that directly benefit the
victim or a charity or project of the victim's choice.

Peer Juries
(Also called Youth. Teen and Student Courts)

Peer Juries are programs in which youth work together with yOuthful offenders. Victims and the
community which is most often the school setting. to repair harm. build competencies and help to create
safer schools and/or communities. Youth Courts typically are set up in different configurations resembling
00urts. while peer juries often resemble BARJ models of Peacemaking Circles or Community Panels
They usually deal with minor delinquent and other problem behaviors

Most programs require youth to admit guilt or accept responSibility prior to panicipation When the
program or disposition is completed. charges or consequences are typically dismissed AgenCies
operating and administering youth court programs include juvenile courts. juvenile probation departments.
law enforcement, private nonprofit organizations. and schools,

Goals
The goals of peer juries are to:

. Determine a fair and restorative sentence or disposition
. Supervise the disposition and monitor the Outcome

Implementation

Successful peerjuries consist of students who are trained in restorative justice practices. moluding circles.
conferencing.- and community panels. Students who participate in peer jury sessrons as Victims.
offenders or community members should be enc0uraged to participate as volunteers on Subsequent
panels.

Restorative Group Conferencing
(Also called Family Group Conferencing or Accountability Conferencing)

Restorative group conferencing involves the community of people most affected by the offense -- the
victim and the offender; and the family. friends and key supporters of both in deciding the resolution of
an incident, These affected parties are brought together by a trained facilitator to discuss how they and
others have been harmed by the offense and how that harm might be repaired. To participate. the
offender must admit to the offense. Participation by all involved is voluntary The faCilitator contacts the
victim and offender to explain the process and invites them to the conference; the facilitator also asks
them to identify key members of their support systems. who will be inVited to participate as well.

The conference typically begins with the offender describing the insident. followed by each participant
describing the impact of the incident on his or her life. it is preferable to allow the victim to start the
discussion, if they wish. Through these narrations, the offender is faced with the human impact of the
behavior on the victim. on those close to the victim. and on the offender's own family and friends. The
victim has the opportunity to express feelings and ask questions about the moident After a thorovgh
discussion of the impact of the behavior on those present, the victim is asked to identify desired outcomes
from the conference. and thus help to shape the obligations that will be placed on the offender All
participants may contribute to the problem-solving process of determining how the offender might best
repair the harm he or she has caused. The session ends with participants Signing an agreement outlining
their expectations and commitments,

Goals
The goals of restorative group conferencing include:

. Provide an opportunity for the victim to be directly involved in the of the offense and in
decisions regarding appropriate sanctions to be placed on the offender

- increase the offenders awareness of the human impact of his or her behavior and provide an
opportunity to take full responsibility for it

Engage the collective responsibility of the offenders support system for making amends and
shaping the offender?s future behavior

. Allow both offender and victim to reconnect to key community support systems

Implementation

In implementing any restorative conferencing program. the facilitators. who may be students or school
personnel. must be trained in conferencing preparation techniques. it is critically important that the
facilitator do everything possible to ensure that neither the victims nor offenders are harmed in any way
Additionally. the victim's participation must be completely voluntary. as should the partiCipation of the
offender. Whenever possible. the victim should be given choices concerning deCisions such as when and
where the conferencing session will take place. who Will be present, who speak first. etc The
facilitator should conduct in person. pre-conferencing sessions with both parties and make follow-up
contacts. including the monitoring of any agreement reached

61

July 28. 2010

Victim Impact Panels

Victim impact panels provide a forum for victims to tell a group of offenders abOut the impact of the
offense on their lives and on the lives of their families, friends. and neighbors Panels typically involve
three or four victim speakers. each of whom Spends ab0ut 15 minutes telling their story in a
nonjudgmental. non-blaming manner. The offenders of the victim presenters are not present While some
time is usually dedicated to questions and answers. the purpose of the panel is for the victims to speak
rather than for the victims and offenders to engage in a dialogue.

Goals
The goals of victim impact panels are to:

0 Help offenders understand the impact of their offenses on victims and communities

. Provide victims with a structured. posrtive outlet to share their personal experiences and to
educate offenders. and others about the physical, emotional, and financial consequences of
o?enses

- Build a partnership among victim service providers and community agencies that can raise the
individual and community awareness of the short- and long-term impacts of crime

Implementation

Many criminal and juvenile justice agencies have institutionalized victim impact panels as a sentencing
option. Victim service organizations either implement the program for the court. or work in collaboration
with justice personnel to conduct panels. Whatever the structure. victim service agencies are usually best
prepared to perform the critically important role of screening victims to ensure they are sufficiently heated
from their victimization experience not to be re-traumatized by partiCipating in the panel Other
implementation tasks are to prepare the victims for participation, moderate the panels, gather 
feedback information. and provide records of participants and program activities to the sentencmg
authority.

Victim Offender Conferencing
(Also called Victim-Offender Mediation. or Victim-Offender Dialogue)

Victim offender mediation is a process that prowdes interested Victims an opportunity to meet their
offender. in a safe and structured setting. and engage in a mediated discussion of the offense. with the
assistance of a trained mediator. the victim is able to tell the offender about the offense's physical
emotional7 and financial impact; to receive answers to lingering questions ab0ut the offense and the
offender; and to be directly involved in developing a restitution plan for the offender to pay back his or her
financia! debt.

This process is different from mediation as it is practiced in civil or commerCiaI disputes, since the
involved parties are not "disputants" nor of similar status - with one an admitted offender and the other the
victim. Also. the process is not primarily fOCused upon reaching a settlement. although most sessions do
in fact. result in a signed restitution agreement. Because of these fundamental differences standard
mediation practices. some programs call the process a victim offender "dialogue." "meeting." or
"conference."

Goals
The goals of victim offender mediation include:

. Support the healing process of victims by providing a safe and controlled setting for them to meet
and speak with the offender on a strictly voluntary basis

a Allow the offender to learn ab0ut the impact of the offense on the victim and to take direct
responsibility for their behavior

. Provide an opportunity for the victim and offender to develop a mutually acceptable plan that
addresses the harm caused by the offense

Implementation

In implementing any victim offender mediation program. it is critically important to maintain to
the needs of the victim. First and foremost. the mediator must do everything posSibie to ensme that the
victim will not be harmed in any way. Additionally. the victim's participation must be completely voluntary
as should the participation of the offender. The victim should also be given choices. whenever possible
concerning decisions such as when and where the mediation session will take place. who Will be present
who will speak first. etc. Cases should be carefully screened regarding the readiness of both victim and
offender to participate. The mediator should conduct in person. pre-mediation with both parties
and make follow-up contacts. including the monitoring of any agreement reached.

THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER RECOMMENDS:

That the Chicago Board of Education adopt a School Performance, Remediation and Probation Policy for
the 2010-2011 School Year.

POLICY TEXT:
l. Purpose and Goals

This policy shall establish the standards and criteria for piacrng a school on Remediation or Probation for
the 2010-2011 school year based on assessments administered in Spring 2010 and other performance
data from prior school years A school's accountability status from the 2009-2010 schoot year shaii
remain in effect until such time as the school is noti?ed of their new status i55ued in accordance with this
policy.

This policy sets cut a systematic means for identifying schools in need of remedial asSistance and
increased oversight due to insufficient levels of achievement Section 5l34-8 3 of the lilin0is School Code
provides for the remediation and probation of attendance centers and reqwres the Chef ExeCutive Officer
to monitor the performance of each school using the criteria and rating system established by the
Board to identify those schools in which: (1) there is a failure to develop, implement. or comply With the
school improvement plan; (2) there is a pervasive breakdown in the educational program as indicated by
various factors such as the absence of improvement in reading and math achievement scores an
increased drop-out rate, a decreased graduation rate, or a decrease in the rate of student attendance or
(3) there is a failure or refusal to comply with the provisions of the School Code. other applicable laws.
collective bargaining agreements. court orders. or with applicable Board rules and policies

The Board recognizes that an effective and fair school remediation and probation system considers
student test score performance. student growth and progress trends Therefore. estainShes a
comprehensive system to assess school performance in order to identify. monitor and assist schools with
low student test scores as well as schools with stagnant or insufficient rates of student improvement

IV. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION SYSTEM
A. Calculation of Score

July 28, 2010

Every school shall receive a performance score based upon its level of current performance. trend over
time and student growth as described in Section below A school will be evaluated on each of the
accountability indicators identified in Section using best available data and will receive a score for each
indicator as well as a total performance score that accounts for the school's overall performance on all
accountability indicators. The total performance score will be used to determine whether a school
quali?es for an Achievement Level 1. 2 or 3 rating. A school shall receive an accountability status
hereunder whereby the school shall be identi?ed as either on Probation in Good Standing or in
Remediation, as further described herein.

8. Determinations

1. Scoring Exceptions: Schools that do not qualify for all pomts hereunder due to the following
circumstances shall have their Achievement level determinations based on the percentage of available
points earned rather than the actual points earned. if data for two previous years is not available for a
particular metric measuring change over time. the school will not get a score for that metric. if data is
available but not reliable due to no fault of the school. the CEO may remove the affected metric from
consideration and the school will not get a score for that metric. The 2008, 2009 and 2010 and
PSAE scores of students who are English Language Learners in program years 0-5 will not be factored
into current status or trend scores hereunder.

2. Accountability Status Determination: A school with an Achievement Level 3 score hereunder
shall receive Probation status, A school with an Achievement Level 1 score or an Achievement Level 2
score hereunder shall receive Good Standing status. except for the following which shall receive
Probation status hereunder:
