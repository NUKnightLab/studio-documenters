order to work cohesively to address the workforce development needs of low-income residents. CCWP
operates five workforce centers in the city of Chicago that serve as community hubs where job seekers
can access skilled vocational counseling and technology to conduct their job search activities. In

new total not-to-exceed amount of $10,389,237 for Option Year 2 for the period of July 2015 through

Gilbane’s construction and program management services to meet the CHA’s critical goals for Senior
Housing, Life Safety, Capital Maintenance, ADA/504 Federal requirements, Scattered Sites and
acquisition projects for 2015 and 2016. Gilbane's role will be to continue to support CCD’s “in-house”
staff, which is not of sufficient size to handle CHA's projected construction projects. Gilbane has
become an integral part of the CCD management team and has provided satisfactory service during
both the base year and option year 1, and the continuation of their construction management services
contract continues to be important to the timely achievement of the CHA’s Plan Forward.

WHEREAS,

RESOLUTION NO. 2015-CHA-48
the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated June 10, 2015

the not-to-exceed amount of the second year by an additional $6,181,518, for a new
total not-to-exceed amount of $10,389,237 for Option Year 2 (7/10/15 through 7/9/16).
The new aggregate total compensation amount of the Contract will be an amount notto-exceed $20,267,935.

(Item 5)
The resolution for Item 5 approves a Second Amendment to the Lease Agreement between A Safe
Haven Foundation and CHA to extend the term of the lease through February of 2016 and approve a
5% rent increase from a monthly amount of $15,566.54 to $16,344.87 during the term of the Second
Amendment to the Lease Agreement and other related expenses as set forth herein. As the end of the
second option year approached, CHA sought a new location for the HCV West Regional Office. By
the time the lease expired at the end of February 2015 CHA had not located a suitable space that met
all its requirements. Subsequent to the lease expiring, CHA approached A Safe Haven Foundation
requesting an additional lease extension, since CHA had not located a new office space location and
knew that it would not be able to vacate the space at the expiration of the lease. A Safe Haven
Foundation indicated that they were not interested in extending the lease, as they had other plans for
the office space. A Safe Haven Foundation understood that CHA might need more time to locate a
new location and permitted CHA to become a “holdover” tenant commencing March 2015, per the
terms of the existing lease. For the months of March 2015 through April 2015, per the terms of the
lease, CHA was required to pay increment percentage increases and incidental service fees for a total
amount of approximately $38,412.00 during the “holdover period”. In early May, A Safe Haven
Foundation reached out to CHA and indicated that they were interested in amending the lease with
CHA to cover the time period from May 2015 through February 2016. A Safe Haven Foundation
4

 proposes increasing the base monthly rent by 5% over the base rent from the second option year
($16,344.87), which is a decrease from the “holdover” rent that was paid in both March and April.
CHA has not paid any rent since the “holdover period”, so an additional $500.00 is being budgeted to
cover any late fees in the event A Safe Haven Foundation charges such fee to CHA, and another
$600.00 is also being budgeted now to cover any fees for additional services, all per the terms of the
current Lease Agreement.
RESOLUTION NO. 2015-CHA-49
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter June 10, 2015 entitled
“REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION TO EXECUTE A SECOND AMENDMENT
TO OFFICE SPACE LEASE BETWEEN A SAFE HAVEN FOUNDATION AND
CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY EXTENDING THE TERM OF THE LEASE
AGREEMENT AND APPROVE A RENT INCREASE AND OTHER RELATED
EXPENSES ”;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his designees to
execute a Second Amendment to the Lease Agreement by and between A Safe Haven
Foundation and Chicago Housing Authority extending the term of the lease from May
2015 through February 2016 and approve a 5% increase in the monthly base rent to
$16,344.87. The Total Gross Base Rent amount for this extension period is in an
amount not-to-exceed $163,449.00 and $1,100.00 for any fees assessed for additional
services or other related expenses as provided for in the Lease, for a total amount notto-exceed $164,549.00.

(Item 6)
The resolution for Item 6 ratifies and accepts a grant award from the Department of Housing and
Urban Development (HUD) in the amount of $248,845 from HUD’s Emergency Safety and Security
Program and to increase CHA’s Asset Management budget accordingly for FY 2015. This grant award
from HUD may only be utilized to support and enhance CHA’s existing surveillance network and
infrastructure at Altgeld Gardens. The purpose of the Emergency Safety and Security Program is to
address safety and security emergencies that pose an increased threat to the health and safety of public
housing residents. Gang warfare and open drug markets pose an everyday threat to the 3,500 residents
living at Altgeld, and over the past year crime incidents have increased nearly 13%. The Emergency
Safety and Security grant will be used to purchase security equipment to augment and enhance the
existing surveillance camera network at Altgeld Gardens, including: sixty new cameras with fast and
precise pan/tilt performance for wide area coverage and great detail when zooming in low light
conditions; two HP Gamma Series Client Viewing Stations for the project management office with
remote access and control of cameras; four 55” LG Smart video monitors for the CHA security office
and Altgeld project management office; 4 Panasonic C2 Toughbooks to monitor video tapes in the
field; additional lenses for two existing cameras to monitor wide areas, capturing details with just one
click. The enhanced digital camera system will allow CHA representatives to better zoom in on areas
of concern, cover blind spots and enter video files into evidence. Like existing cameras, video files
and data from these enhancements to the system can assist the Chicago Police Department in
investigations and criminal prosecutions. The integrated access control system will ease identification
of people entering CHA properties.

There being no questions or discussion, Chairwoman Scott thereupon declared said Motion carried and
said resolutions adopted.
Jack Markowski, Chairman of the Real Estate Development committee, then presented his report. Per
Commissioner Markowski, the Real Estate and Development committee did not officially meet on
Wednesday, June 10, 2015 however, Commissioners and the public were briefed on the four items
appearing on the agenda, and the items were open to comments and questions from Commissioners
and the public, but for the record, no vote was taken.
On behalf of the Real Estate Development Committee, Commissioner Markowski then presented an
Omnibus Motion for the approval of Items 9 through 12.
(Item 9)
The resolution for Item 9 approves the selection of The Community Builders, Inc. and McCaffery
Interests, Inc. (TCB-MI) as the development team for the redevelopment of Harold Ickes Homes;
approves a contract for Redevelopment with the development team; and approves the execution of
other documents as may be necessary to implement the foregoing. It is the intent of the CHA, in
collaboration with the City of Chicago Department of Planning and Development (DPD) to implement
a smart growth, public-private revitalizing plan that will create a vibrant Ickes community. The urban
revitalization efforts will place a strong emphasis on a high quality mix of residential and commercial
on the target development site. The Ickes development site is very conveniently located at a crossroads
of many transportation opportunities. On October 3, 2014, the CHA issued a Request for Proposals
(RFP) for a developer for the Harold Ickes Homes revitalization program. The RFP required
development teams to provide a minimum of 200 public housing units to be developed as part of the
total income mix. The RFP requested that developers propose a mixed-income, mixed-use residential
development establishing a welcoming, diverse neighborhood that promoted healthy living and
empowerment via education, economic development and civic participation. The RFP recommended
that revitalization proposals provide for both rental and for sale options including affordable
homeownership. It also recommended that developers’ proposed plan foster retail/commercial and
small business development for local job creation. Under the solicitation, the corner of Cermak Road
and State Street was identified to anchor the retail/commercial element of the Harold Ickes
revitalization site. The RFP placed special emphasis on this corner as a transit hub, to maximize retail
frontage for ground floor tenants and increased density with a maximum building height comparable to
surrounding building structures. The final retail square footage and housing unit breakdown shall be
determined through the predevelopment process. The CHA received five (5) responses, evaluated
written proposals and conducted oral presentations. TCB-MI pursuant to a joint venture agreement
executed December 18, 2014, submitted a proposal to construct approximately 867 residential units
and approximately 42,500 to 66,500 square feet of new commercial/retail space. Based on the RFP
evaluation process, TCB-MI is the recommended development team for Ickes. TCB-MI intends to
form TCB-MI Ickes, LLC, a to be formed Illinois limited liability company, to be the developer legal
entity.
The development team will assume responsibility of the overall development process,
including but not limited to predevelopment work, design and site planning, infrastructure and utilities
planning, site preparation, environmental engineering and remediation, preparing funding applications,
assembling financing, obtaining necessary governmental approvals such as zoning and building
permits, LEED certification at a minimum of Silver level, marketing, leasing units, ongoing property
management and community and supportive services.

(Item 11)
The resolution for Item 11 approves a preliminary commitment letter for The Carling Hotel for
Property Rental Assistance or a support letter for The Carling Hotel Rental Development to provide a
CHA Loan not to exceed $7,799,740. Dependent on participation from other financing sources, CHA

other development and construction financing. Once all financing is secured, the full development
plans will be submitted to the CHA Board prior to execution of an Agreement to Enter into a Housing
Assistance Payment Contract (AHAP/HAP) or prior to the submission of a development proposal for
public housing units to HUD. CHA would submit a development proposal for the acquisition and
rehabilitation of the Carling Hotel into a mixed finance rental development that would include 26
public housing units. The acquisition would allow CHA to convey the property to MDC either in fee
simple or by ground lease, in order to generate additional donation tax credit equity financing for the
transaction. The total estimated development budget for The Carling Hotel rental development is
approximately $24,595,323 and includes the CHA Loan of $7,799,740. The Carling Hotel currently
consists of 155 total Single Room Occupancy (SRO) units. The developer intends to reconfigure the
building to 78 studio units. The scope of work includes constructing kitchens and full bathrooms in all
units and replacement of major building systems including heating electrical, elevators and exterior

RESOLUTION 2015-CHA-55
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the Board
letter dated June 10, 2015 requesting authorization to execute either 1) a preliminary
8

 commitment letter for The Carling Hotel for Property Rental Assistance or 2) a support
letter for The Carling Hotel Rental Development to provide a Chicago Housing
Authority (CHA) Loan not to exceed $7,799,740;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY:
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to
execute either 1) a preliminary commitment letter for The Carling Hotel for Property
Rental Assistance or 2) a support letter for The Carling Hotel Rental Development to
provide a Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) Loan not to exceed $7,799,740.

(Item 12)
The resolution for item 12 approves either a preliminary commitment letter for The Marshall Hotel for
Property Rental Assistance or a support letter for the Marshall Hotel Rental Development to provide a
CHA Loan not to exceed $8,086,500. Similar to Item 11, dependent on participation from other
financing sources, CHA will provide only one letter which will be valid for one year in order to allow
the developer to secure other development and construction financing. Once all financing is secured,
the full development plans will be submitted to the CHA Board prior to execution of an Agreement to
Enter into a Housing Assistance Payment Contract (AHAP/HAP) or prior to the submission of a
development proposal for public housing units to HUD. CHA would submit a development proposal
for the acquisition and rehabilitation of the Marshall Hotel into a mixed finance rental development
that would include 27 public housing units. The acquisition would allow CHA to convey the property
to MDC either in fee simple or by ground lease, in order to generate additional donation tax credit
equity financing for the transaction. The total estimated development budget for The Marshall Hotel
rental development is approximately $25,840,464 and includes the CHA Loan of $8,086,500. The
Marshall Hotel currently consists of 173 total Single Room Occupancy (SRO) units. The developer
intends to reconfigure the building to 81 studio units. 9 of the PRA units will be designated for the
State Referral Network. PRA rents will reflect neighborhood market rents. Building amenities will
include a library/reading room, vending snack machines, laundry facilities, secured bicycle parking,
individual storage lockers, no-smoking units, on-site property management, secured entrances and
common hallways, security cameras and intercom system.

WHEREAS,
