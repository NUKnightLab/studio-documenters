June 24, 2015

Owners for their consent thereto in form satisfactory to the Trustee, shall be mailed to the
Owners, but failure to mail such copy and request shall not affect the validity of such
Supplemental Indenture when consented to as in this Section provided. Such Supplemental
Indenture shall not be e??ective unless and until, and shall take e??ect in accordance with its terms
when there shall have been ?led with the Trustee the written consents of the Owners of the

revocation thereof is on ?le with it. Any consent, or revocation thereof, may be delivered or
?led prior to any mailing or publication required by this Article and shall not be deemed
ineffective by reason of such prior delivery or ?ling. Within thirty (30) days of any date on
which the consents on ?le with the Trustee and not theretofore revoked shall be suf?cient under
this Section, the Trustee shall make and deliver to the Board a written statement that the consents
of the Owners of the required aggregate principal amount of Outstanding Notes have been ?led
with the Trustee. Such written statement shall be conclusive that such consents have been so
?led. Any time thereafter notice, stating in substance that the Supplemental Indenture has been
consented to by the Owners of the required principal amount of Outstanding Notes and will be
e?'ective as provided in this Section, shall be given by mailing to the Owners (but failure to mail
such notice or any defect therein shall not prevent such Supplemental Indenture from becoming
effective and binding). The Trustee shall deliver to the Board proof of the mailing of such
notice. A record, consisting of the information required or permitted by this Section to be
delivered by or to the Trustee, shall be proof of the matters therein stated.

resPect by a Supplemental Indenture effecting such modi?cation or amendment and with the
consents of the Owners of all the Notes then Outstanding, each such consent to be accompanied

consent is given. Such Supplemental Indenture shall take e?'ect upon the ?ling with the

Opinion referred to in Section 10.3 and with the Board of the Trustee?s written statement that

$_,000,000 in multiple Advances from time to time (the ?Notes?). Capitalized terms used but
not de?ned herein shall have ,the same meaning as in the Indenture. As Authorized Of?cer
designated under the Indenture, I hereby certify as follows with respect to the Supplemental
Advance described below on the Notes:

3. Each of the Indenture, the Credit Agreement, the Tax Agreement, and any
certi?cate executed and delivered by the Board in connection therewith, has not been
amended or modi?ed and is in full force and effect as of the date hereof. Each such
agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Board enforceable

The term of this agreement shall commence on September_1, 2015 and shall and August 31, 2018. This
agreement shall have three (3) options to renew for periods of two (2) years each.

EARLY TERMINATION RIGHT:
The Board shall have the right to terminate this agreement with 30 days written notice.

SCOPE OF SERVICES:

The Vendor will provide the integrated, centralized library automation system, Library Solution for
Schools, including all selected enhancement products and related services. The library automation
software will provide a searchable catalog of library collections and to automate administrative tasks such
as the circulation of library materials among patrons and the generation of library statistics and reports.
The integrated library automation system will include Web?based Online Public Access Catalog,
Cataloging and Authority Control, Circulation, Seriats Controls, and Reporting capabilities. in addition to
this core functionality, the system will support integrated searching of print and electronic resources and
the inclusion of vendor and third-party supplied content such as images of book jackets, book reviews,
reading level data, and author information. Should the Board desire to expand the functionality of the
system in the future, the system is capable of supporting Inter-Library Loan, Textbook Management,
Classroom Library Management, and Materials Booking. The Vendor will provide implementation services
including project management and training services.

DELIVERABLES:

The Vendor will provide the Library Solution for Schools Software Licenses, implementation and project
management services, installation and con?guration of servers, end-user training, data conversion and
enhancement services, help desk design and deployment, and software technical support, upgrades and
maintenance as required by the Board.

OUTCOMES:
The integrated library system will result in:

Effective Materials Integration: Teachers and librarians can use an integrated
library system for a multitude of purposes, from posting reading lists, bibiiographies and path?nders online
to creating easy title searches by reading program. Furthermore, library professionals are freed from the
time consuming task of manually performing the circulation and cataloging functions of running a library.
This change enables them to spend more time working with students and collaborating with teachers.

322

June 24, 2015

Collection DeVelopment: Schools and the Board can use the system to identify collection gaps, determine
collection age, and understand resource usage trends, thereby driving better purchase decisions. In
addition, librarians can electronically share collection information with other librarians considering similar
purchases. -

Library Automation: An integrated library system will provide bene?ts on two levels. First, all schools will
have a state-of-the-art, fully maintained system. Second, a centralized system will relieve librarians and
tech coordinators of the time-consuming administrative tasks asSociated with independent systems. such
as the purchasing of systems and servers, installing upgrades and backing-up data. Again, this is
valuable time that can now be spent with students.

Use of Online Resources: CPS iibraries currently invest $155,000 of grant funds annuatly in online
subscription databases GalelCengage, Britannica). An integrated library system will
increase the use of these databases, as they can be included in a variety of searches, thereby
dramatically expanding the quantity and quality of resources that students use.

Coordination of Library Technology with other technology in the school: The centralized system will
interface with other district-wide and school databases, such as the Board's student information system,
Furthermore, students and educators will be able to access the library from all school
classrooms with an internet connection, transforming a basic computer into a virtual extension of the
library.

Grant Applications and Implementation: Most library grant applications require detailed information about
library collections and trends. Furthermore, the ability to be accountable for speci?c goals is a major
driver of success in attaining grants. Without library automation, even basic questions such as "number of
books in collection" or "percent increase in circulation? are nearly impossible to answer without a manual
count. A centralized system will allow both schools and district to instantly address these questions with
pre-developed reports.

Coordination of school and public library resources and services: A centralized system is a prerequisite
for coordination among schools and with the public library system, as it enables searching of alt schools'
and, potentially, the Chicago Public Library's records. In addition, the system can be used to loan
resources across the district.

COMPENSATION:

Vendor shall be paid as speci?ed in Vendors agreement.
