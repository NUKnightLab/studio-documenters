B. Human Resources Committee
i. Metrics (Attachment #1)
Director Richardson-Lowry and Barbara Pryor, Interim Chief Human Resources Officer, provided an overview of
the metrics. The Board reviewed and discussed the information.

C. Managed Care Committee
i. Metrics (Attachment #2)
Director Junge and James Kiamos, Chief Executive Officer of CountyCare, reviewed the metrics. The Board
reviewed and discussed the information.
Mr. Kiamos referenced the State-imposed goal of 95% for encounter rates that plans are required to meet. If a plan
falls below 95%, they are fined, and if they fall below 90%, they will no longer receive auto-assignments of new
members. A few plans (of those listed on Slide 4 of the presentation) have fallen below 90%, yet they are still
receiving auto-assignment of new members; the fact that they are still receiving auto-assignments adversely impacts
the other plans who are doing a good job at this. Director Richardson-Lowry requested information on the identity
of those plans whose encounter rates have fallen below 90%. Mr. Kiamos responded that he will provide that
information through the Chair.
In response to a question from Director Driscoll regarding Integrated Health Homes, Dr. Shannon stated that, within
the State’s now accepted 1115 Waiver with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) around
behavioral health, there is a component around Integrated Health Homes that are integrating mental health and
clinical health. He stated that the Board will receive a more detailed overview on the subject sometime in the coming
months.

 Why is our work important? 
Consider pandemic influenza… 
•  CCDPH would be required to ensure vaccination of the 
entire Suburban Cook County population  
–  Using Strategic National Stockpile assets (i.e. vaccine) 
–  Requires many medical professionals, volunteers & space 
–  Requires extensive planning, training and exercising at 
the county and local (community) levels 
–  Partner relations are key to the success of preparedness 
and response work! 
•  Cook County government agencies, municipal leadership, 
first responder community

of Cook County officials by prior to purchasing hoSpitals and/or adding or reducing healthcare licensed,
risk bearing entities in CountyCare. The amendment codifies existing practice.

President Preckwinkle submitted appointments for the Board of Directors to the Cook County Board for
consideration. Below are the appointees:

0 Mary Gugenheim (re-appointment)

0 David E. Munar (re?appointment)

0 Heather Prendergast, MD, MS, MPH

On September 26, 2018 the Legislation Committee approved the appointments and the County Board ratified.

Public Act 100-581, also known as the hospital re-assessment program, was enacted earlier this year. A Hospital
Transformation Review Committee (HTRC) was created as part of the legislation. The HTRC has been convening
in order to assist the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services (HFS) in developing a hospital
transformation program to provide financial assistance to hospitals as they transform their services and care
models to better align with the needs of the communities they serve. Twelve state legislators, the HFS Director,
and the Acting Medicaid Director serve on the HTRC.

The Illinois Health and Hospital Association has also convened a group of hospitals to discuss
transformation and will present their recommendations to the HTRC upon review and approval by their
board of trustees. Dr. Shannon participates on the IHA transformation committee.

Last week, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled to uphold the constitutionality ofa 2012 state law (PA
97?688) that sets standards for property tax exemptions for Illinois nonprofit hospitals, if the value of their
charitable activities exceeds what the hospital would have paid in property taxes. About 75% of Illinois hospitals
have a nonprofit status.

The General Assembly Fall Veto Session is scheduled for November 13-15 and November 27-29.

On September 6, 2018 Dr. Shannon traveled to Washington, DC with Cook County Board President Toni
Preckwinkle to meet with Cook County members of Illinois? Congressional delegation on matters of importance
to 

Congress reconvened after Labor Day to begin the final legislative push before the end of the fiscal year
September 30, 2018 and the midterm elections November 6, 2018. While much of the focus has been on
confirmation hearings for the U.S. Supreme Court, a number of other consequential health policy matters have
been proceeding.

The Senate passed the FY 2019 Labor?HHS-Education appropriations bill, packaged together with the FY 2019
Department of Defense appropriations bill on August 23, 2018 as the third ?minibus? (H.R. 6157, as amended).
The differences between the House and Senate measures were negotiated in a conference committee and the
Senate overwhelmingly approved the conference report on September 18, 2018.

The agreement funds U.S. Department of Health and Human Services agencies and programs of potential
interest to CCH HS.

0 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): $7.9 billion, $354 million less than FY 2018. After
accounting for one-time facilities funding in FY 2018, it means an increase of $126 million for CDC at a
comparable level. This includes $805 million from the ACA Prevention and Public Health Fund. The bill
also maintains the Dickey Amendment prohibition against using federal funds to advocate or promote
gun control.

0 Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA): $5.7 billion, $584 million over
FY 2018. Continues prohibition on federal funds for the purchase of syringes or sterile needles but
allows communities with rapid increases in cases of HIV and hepatitis to access federal funds for other
activities, including substance-use counseling and treatment referrals.

I $1.9 billion for the Substance Abuse Block Grant, the same as FY 2018

I $89 million for Criminal Justice activities, the same as FY 2018

I $6.7 billion plus to address substance use and mental health, including opioid and heroin abuse,
$228 million over FY 2018, including $1.5 billion in state opioid response grants

0 Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA): $6.8 billion for HRSA, $107 million over FY 2018
I $122.5 million for the Healthy Start program, $12 million over FY 2018
I $678 million for the Maternal and Child Health Block Grant, $26 million over FY 2018

0 Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ): $338 million for AHRQ, $4 million above the fiscal
year 2018 enacted level.

0 Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund (PHSSEF): $2 billion for PHSSEF, $868 million over FY
2018
I $735 million, $25 million over FY 2018, for Project BioShield, for the acquisition of medical
countermeasures
I $260 million, $10 million over FY 2018, for Pandemic Influenza Preparedness

The House returned the week of September 24, 2018 and leaders expressed confidence that they would pass
the conference report, despite grumbling from more conservative Republicans about the overall funding levels
and the fact that most of their controversial policy riders had been jettisoned in negotiations with the Senate.

0 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell brought the Senate opioid package, the SUPPORT for Patients
and Communities Act (HR. 6, as amended) to the floor on September 17, 2018 where it passed 99?1. House and
Senate negotiators have been working to iron out the differences between the two chambers? versions. Among
the sticking points are a House provision that would ease the Medicaid institutions for mental disease (IMD)
exclusion for inpatient opioid and cocaine treatment. Another controversial provision in the House bill would
make it easier for providers to share medical records for substance use treatment under 42 CFR Part 2. The
American Medical Association has ceme out against the provision, while the American Hospital Association
supports the provision.

- Efforts to chip away at the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) and counter-efforts to protect it 
continued in late August and into September. On September 14, 2018 a group of health care organizations filed
a lawsuit asking the US. District Court for the District of Columbia to set aside the Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services (CMS) rule expanding the availability of short-term plans. The rule would permit people to
enroll in short?term plans for up to a year and renew for up to three years. While they can be inexpensive, these
plans can skirt ACA rules on essential benefits, guaranteed issue, community rating, etc. The plaintiffs include
the Association for Community Affiliated Plans, National Alliance on Mental Illness, Mental Health America, the
American Association, AIDS United, the National Partnership for Women and Families, and Little
Lobbyists.

0 Over the weekend, the Trump Administration issued a press release and text of a highly anticipated rule
concerning new public charge rules. Public charge is an assessment that federal immigration officials undertake
when evaluating an immigrant?s application for entry into the United States and/or for permanent residency 
green ca rd). The new rules could have a chilling effect on immigrants accessing public services that they or their
children would be otherwise eligible for in fear of losing legal immigration status.

The proposed changes dramatically expand what and who would be considered in public charge, by including
additional programs that help households meet basic needs such as Medicaid, the Supplemental Nutrition
Assistance Program (SNAP), and housing assistance programs. Not only would this rule harm the health and
well-being of Cook County households, but tens of millions of dollars are estimated to be lost in spending on
health care and in the local economy due to immigrants not applying or withdrawing from benefits. The effects
on may be significant due to anticipated losses in insured patient revenue and increased uncompensated
care. Once posted to the Federal Register, there will be 60 days to provide comments on the draft rule. 
will be submitting comments and encourages our partners to do the same.

Protection of Medicaid remains a key priority for at both the State and Federal level.
