WHEREAS, offenders are very mobile, with 25% moving each year; and
WHEREAS, the new offender population increases by a rate of 10% annually; and
WHEREAS, online alert systems are available, which not only allow a citizen to look
up registered offenders in their area, but to receive an email alert, followed by a
postcard when a registered sex offender moves to within one mile of sensitive
addresses, such as a home, school, park, etc.; and
WHEREAS, a web-based offender watch system will also permit one to conduct
address searches that will create a map showing all offenders within one mile of the
address, as well as a geographic risk assessment of the offenders; and
WHEREAS, this program will also allow for city and name searches, as well as
provide detailed descriptions on offenders including: name, aliases, physical
description, photograph, nature of conviction and a map of the offender’s address; and
WHEREAS, this program is an important tool that will enable one to attain this
necessary knowledge to help keep our children and families safe and at a relatively
low cost; and
WHEREAS, it is in the interest of everyone to help protect our children from this
seemingly ever increasing danger.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of
Commissioners does hereby request that the Cook County Sheriff’s web site
implement an Offender Watch system with an automatic email alert capability, which
will assist in informing our residents where sexual offenders reside and thereby giving
them, in a timely manner, the information they need to protect their families and
reduce the chance of future victimization.
