Sec. 106-2. - Definitions
***

Designated Floodway means the channel, including on-stream lakes, and that portion of the floodplain
adjacent to a stream or watercourse as designated by IDNR/OWR, which is needed to store and convey
the existing 100-year frequency flood discharge with no more than a 0.1 foot increase in stage due to the
loss of flood conveyance or storage, and no more than a ten percent increase in velocities.
(1) The floodways are designated on the countywide Flood Insurance Rate Map for Cook County
number 17031C, panels 15-609, 616, 628, 637-701, 706, and 708-832, dated August 19, 2008,

***

Floodplain means that land typically adjacent to a body of water with ground surface elevations at or
below the base flood or the 100-year frequency flood elevation. Floodplains may also include detached
special flood hazard areas (SFHAs), ponding areas, etc. The floodplain is also known as the special flood
hazard area (SFHA). The floodplains are those lands within the jurisdiction of the County that are subject
to inundation by the base flood or 100-year frequency flood. The special flood hazard areas (SFHAs) of
the County are generally identified on the Countywide flood insurance rate map (FIRM) for Cook County
number 17031C, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agent[Agency], panels 15-609, 616,
628, 637-701, 706, and 708-832 and dated August 19, 2008, and panels 611-614, 617-619, 636, 702-704,
707 dated November 1, 2019.
***

NGVD means the National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929. Reference surface set by the National
Geodetic Survey deduced from a continental adjustment of all existing adjustments in 1929.
NAVD88 means North American Vertical Datum of 1988. NAVD88 supersedes the National Geodetic

Vertical Datum of 1929 (NGVD).
***

Substantial improvement means any repair, reconstruction or improvement of a structure, subsequent to
the adoption of this ordinance wherein, the cost of the improvements which equals or exceeds 50 percent
of the market value of the structure or increases the floor area by 20 percent either, before the
improvement or repair is started, or if the structure has been damaged, and is being restored, before the
damage occurred.
***
Sec. 106-5. - Base flood elevation.
***

(3)

The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for the special flood hazard area
(SFHA's) shall be as delineated on the 100-year flood profiles in the Countywide flood

2019, and such amendments to such study and maps as may be prepared from time to time.
