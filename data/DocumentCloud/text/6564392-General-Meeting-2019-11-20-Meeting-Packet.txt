Service Description:
 The purpose of the funding is to provide wraparound supportive services through FrontLine Service and
appropriate housing through EDEN’s scattered site housing.
 Services to be provided by Frontline include case management, diversion, peer support and care coordination.
 EDEN will provide rental assistance and start-up costs to purchase furniture and other housing needs.

Background Information:
 This Pilot program will utilize a “Housing First” model combined with comprehensive wraparound services to
provide a venue for chronically homeless MHDD offenders to obtain permanent supportive housing within the
community. The target population often experiences periods of significant incarceration and hospitalizations.


This Pilot program will not only assist the MHDD Court in better understanding the housing needs of the
MHDD population, it will also encourage the local housing community to work with criminal justice agencies to
provide reliable stable housing that reduces recycling and recidivism—a significant goal of the Cuyahoga
County Stepping Up Taskforce. This program, once fully operational, will reduce the existing incarcerated
population within the Cuyahoga County jail.

Number of Individuals to be served:
 Up to 30 MHDD Offenders annually
Funding Use:
 MHDD Offender Housing stabilization
Client & System Impact:
 This proposed Pilot Program is anticipated to help achieve long-term stable housing for the MHDD Offender
Population through wraparound community-based services. This combination should reduce the number
MHDD offenders’ cycling and recycling through the justice system. The Pilot program will have an immediate

 impact on the number of MHDD offenders held in the County jail due to homelessness. This jail population
historically has been one of the most expensive to maintain in a correctional setting.

available for the Sober Housing Program from $300,000.00 to $150,000.00 based on current and projected
program usage; and to extend the program period until June 30, 2022.

sober house is not to exceed 3 months unless there is a case conference held, and the stay authorized for an
extension
Number of Individuals to be served: Estimate of 133 Offenders annually, with an average stay of 90 days each

identified by multiple Common Pleas Court Judges, who requested the Corrections
Planning Board explore funding options because of successes observed by them in their
respective courtrooms.

Service Description:
 The mission of the AIDS Funding Collaborative (AFC) is to strengthen the community’s response to
HIV/AIDS, as a public/private partnership providing coordination, leadership, advocacy, and funding in
Greater Cleveland.
 The AIDS Funding Collaborative (AFC) is a funding partnership that includes private philanthropic funders,
government agencies, medical professionals, community organizations, and people living with HIV/AIDS. AFC
funding partners include: ADAMHS Board of Cuyahoga County; Cuyahoga County; Cleveland Department of
Public Health; The Cleveland Foundation; The George Gund Foundation; and The Mt. Sinai Health Care
Foundation.
 Since 1994, the AIDS Funding Collaborative (AFC) has maximized every dollar invested by local funding
partners to benefit the greater Cleveland community. The pooled funding model leverages each funder’s
contribution, filling critical programming gaps and building community capacity to meet the challenge of ending
the local HIV/AIDS epidemic.
Background Information:
 The AFC is one of the original 8 community partnerships of the National AIDS Fund (now AIDS United). Since its
inception in 1994, the AFC has leveraged and invested over $13 million to support HIV/AIDS-related prevention
efforts, care and services, training and evaluation activities in Greater Cleveland.
 The ADAMHS Board has been a funding partner of the AFC since 2006 - leveraging funds to amplify results
related to strategic HIV prevention and care including services for mental health, addiction and harm reduction
strategies related to intravenous drug use, in addition to transportation, housing, and employment support.
 The ADAMHS Board’s presence and expertise as collaborative partner promotes the critical need for individuals
living with HIV/AIDS to have access to behavioral health services and other recovery supports to sustain their
efforts of recovery and resilience.
 An ADAMHS Board member and staff member sit on the AFC Advisory Committee.
Number of Individuals to be served:
 The AFC does not provide direct services to individuals. Instead, AFC funders work together to support grantees
with an annual combined grantmaking budget of over $400,000 for community HIV prevention and care
programming and capacity building. The exceptions are outreach and training – and since 2017, social marketing
campaigns for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP).

 



So far in 2019, AFC funds supported programming at 13 different grantee organizations, including the AIDS
Taskforce of Greater Cleveland, Circle Health Services, CWRU School of Nursing, Equality Ohio, Garden Valley
Neighborhood House, the LGBT Center of Greater Cleveland, MetroHealth Medical Center, Nueva Luz Urban
Resource Center, University Settlement and Ursuline Piazza. The 2019 grantmaking budget of nearly $420,000
reached thousands of people in Greater Cleveland.
The AFC coordinates grassroots outreach initiatives twice a year and reaches thousands of commuters at each
with HIV awareness information. The AFC also provides professional development opportunities for local service
providers and reaches 50–100 annually. With the PrEP campaigns to date we have achieved over 25 million
impressions through outdoor transit, Facebook/Instagram, radio, convenience store and gas pump ads.

Funding Use:
A public/private funding collaborative as a strategy guided by data and stakeholder feedback to reduce the
impact of HIV/AIDS in our community.
 Grant-making to fill gaps in the community where other public dollars cannot be used, and build capacity among
community prevention and care providers.
 Advocacy for sound public health and fiscal policies for HIV/AIDS programming.

Metrics
(How will goals
be measured)

Evaluation/
Outcome Data
(Actual results
from program)



Due to the combined funding efforts of a number of organizations involvement with the
AFC, the metrics for these prevention/risk reduction interventions vary with each grant
cycle.
So far in 2019, the AFC:
 Allocated $418,323 in grant-making, including discretionary (up to $5,000), targeted, and
responsive (annual, 1-year cycle) grants; grantees included Circle Health Services for
the syringe exchange program (the AFC is the largest funder), Nueva Luz Urban
Resource Center to provide operating support for a fiscal officer, University Settlement
to conduct an HIV/AIDS assessment and provide capacity-building in Broadway-Slavic
Village, MetroHealth for county-wide expansion of their youth-focused “positive peers”
social networking app, and the LGBT Community Center for youth-focused HIV
prevention.
 Convened professional training on U=U (Undetectable equals Un-transmittable), and an
annual Community Briefing on proceedings from national HIV conferences; participation
in the events was at capacity and feedback was positive.
 Co-sponsored grassroots outreach events for National HIV Testing Day that featured
Black Women’s AIDS Ambassador and long-term survivor, Hydeia Broadbent; >1,000
individuals were reached with information and about HIV testing, stigma, and PrEP.
 Sustained the final year of our strategic plan, which aligns with the national HIV/AIDS
Strategy, and began the process of creating a new one that will focus intense effort on
local HIV ‘hot spots’ (high-burden areas) and align with the new national End the HIV
Epidemic initiative.
 (This list provides a snapshot of AFC activities and outcomes; additional detail is
available upon request.)

Recommendation to Board of Directors from Board Staff and/or from Board Committee(s):
 To recommend approval to the Board of Directors to allocate the funds to the Center for Community SolutionsAIDS Funding Collaborative in the amount of $75,000.00.
