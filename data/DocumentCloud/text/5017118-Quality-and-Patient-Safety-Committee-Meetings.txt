NSQIP Data Collection
Data Collection Details
Semi-Annual Report (SAR) Content
Institutional Project Targets
Examples – Using NSQIP Data to Improve Care:
- Prolonged nil-per-os/nasogastric tube use in colectomy
- Surgical site infections
• Appendix
During the discussion of the information, a question was raised regarding the financing of this project.
Dr. Wille responded that the first three (3) years were funded through a contract with Blue Cross Blue
Shield. Dr. Richard Keen, System Chair of the Department of Surgery, indicated that the cost for this
year’s program was built into CCHHS’ budget. Staff are trying to do more, to try and increase the depth
of this program. Dr. Keen added that, with regard to risk adjustment, this data reflects that the hospital is
treating sicker patients; data had not previously been captured well enough to confirm this until now. By
capturing this documentation, this will increase the hospital’s reimbursement and reflect in its scoring by
other bodies.
Ms. Merryweather inquired whether future reports can include a breakdown between inpatient and
outpatient data. Dr. Wille indicated that it may be challenging to do, but he will look further into it.

 Using NSQIP data to improve care:
Prolonged nil-per-os/nasogastric tube use
(NPO/NGT) in Colectomy
•
•
•

Prolonged NPO/NGT use is one of many potential occurrences in
patients undergoing colectomy
Occurrence indicates that bowel function has not returned after
operation
Prolonged NPO/NGT use leads to:
–

Increased length of stay
Reoperations
Decline in functional status
Increased discomfort and pain
Increased risk of pulmonary complications
Increased healthcare costs

112 colectomies in 2017 (up from 80 colectomies in 2016)

 Using NSQIP data to improve care: Surgical
Site Infections
• Second most common type of healthcare-associated
infection (HAI) in U.S. Hospitals (290,000 per year)
• Estimated cost: $3.5-10 billion per year
• Patient with SSI is:
– 5 times more likely to be admitted after discharge
– 2 times more likely to spend time in intensive care
– 2 times more likely to die after surgery

Maintenance of Certification (MOC), Part IV.

•

The Joint Commission awards ACS NSQIP hospitals a Merit Badge
on their Quality Check public website.

•

The National Quality Forum has endorsed 5 ACS NSQIP outcome
measures.

•

CMS and ACS NSQIP are partnering to publicly report surgical

Participation in a Systematic Clinical Database Registry for General
Surgery.

 NSQIP Case Selection
• Systematic Sampling Process
– Cases are selected based on the NSQIP
inclusion/exclusion criteria
• Inclusion based on CPT® codes of major cases
• General exclusion criteria
– Pediatrics
– Trauma and Transplant
– ASA class 6
• An 8 day cycle yields on average 250 surgical procedures
– Once exclusion criteria are applied to about 30% of the cases,
there are enough cases remaining to fulfill the 30 cases per cycle
NSQIP requirement

What is HEDIS?
HEDIS (Healthcare Effectiveness Data Information Set) is
used by most of America's health plans to measure
performance on care and service. HEDIS contains 81
measures across five domains of care. The collection of
defined HEDIS data allows an "apples-to-apples" comparison
of health plans.
5 Domains of Care:
1. Effectiveness of care
2. Access/availability of care
3. Experience of care
4. Utilization and relative resource use
5. Health plan descriptive information

ACHN is effectively expanding MAT services across the
network. By the end of April, 2018, a total of 11 of the
14 sites listed will offer MAT services.
The goal is for 100% of the Primary Care sites to offer
MAT services to combat the Opioid epidemic
within the community by July, 2018.
