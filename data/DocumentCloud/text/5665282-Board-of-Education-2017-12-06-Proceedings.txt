President Clark presented the following Statement for the Public Record:

I want to read a statement. I know that there?s a news item that the media is very interested
in and I want to read a statement from the Board. The Board just received a report last night from
the Inspector General, and we take seriously our responsibility to thoughtfully and thoroughly
evaluate this report, and we will do so. Forrest has done excellent work fighting for equal funding
of Chicago students, including filing an important civil rights lawsuit on their behalf, one that the
Board unanimously supported. This was crucial to receive more equal funding for Chicago
students, and Forrest showed exemplary leadership. This is my full statement. Neither Board
Members nor I will have additional comments while we review this report. Thank you.

through 12 with a maximum enrollment of 500 students.

The agreement will incorporate an accountability plan in which the charter school is evaluated by the
Board each year based on numerous factors related to its academic, ?nancial and operational
performance.

On November 22. 2017, the Of?ce of Innovation and Incubation provided written notice to ACE Tech that

the Chief Executive Officer intended to recommend to the Board the revocation of its charter and
Charter School Agreement effective at the end of the 2017?201 8 school year.

Section of the Illinois Charter Schools Law states that a charter may be revoked if it fails to
"meet or make reasonable progress toward achievement of the content standards or pupil performance
standards identi?ed in the charter". Furthermore, Section of the Illinois Charter Schools Law
states that, after being noti?ed of the reason for revocation, the charter school must submit a written plan
for remediation and the plan for remediation will be reviewed and a determination will be made whether
the charter school failed to implement the plan.

 

ACE Tech?s Charter School Agreement dictates that the charter'school will be evaluated annually in
accordance with the CPS School Quality Rating Policy and Charter School Quality Policy
to determine if the school is meeting or making reasonable progress toward achievement of the
content standards or pupil performance standards. On November 4, 2016, the Of?ce of Innovation and
Incubation noti?ed ACE Tech that it received a Level 2 rating on the SQRP for the prior 2015-2016 school
year and its school was failing to meet standards or make reasonable progress toward achievement of
the content standards or pupil performance standards and the revocation process began. ACE Tech
submitted a remediation plan and placed on the Academic Warning List. The Office of Innovation and
Incubation, in coniunction with "the Of?ce of Accountability, reviewed the remediation plan and its
implementation in accordance with the academic revocation process timeline. On October 20, 2017, ACE

performance standards.

consideration of revocation for the charter school. The hearing notice was published on October 31 on
and in the November 1El edition of the Chigago Sun? Times. The hearinchas conducted on

Pursuant to the Illinois Charter Schools Law and the Charter School Aoreement the CEO recommends
that the charter and Charter School Agreement for ACE Tech be revoked at the end of the 2017?2018
schopl year because ACE Tech has been on the Academic Warning List for two consecutive years and
