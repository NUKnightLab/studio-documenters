Call to Order and Roll Call
The Budget Committee of the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority met on
Friday, June 19, 2015, at 300 West Adams, Main Building Conference Room - 2nd Floor,
Chicago, Illinois. Authority Chair Hon. Elizabeth Robb called the meeting to order at
9:02 a.m. Authority Deputy General Counsel Junaid Afeef called the roll. Other
Authority members and designees present were Jennifer Greene for State’s Attorney
Anita Alvarez, Patricia McCreary for Clerk Dorothy Brown, Amy Campanelli, Kathryn
Dunne for Sheriff Tom Dart, Cynthia Hora for Attorney General Madigan, James Hickey
for Superintendent Garry McCarthy, James Chadd for Director Michael J. Pelletier,
Rebecca Janowitz for President Toni Preckwinkle, Authority Chair Hon. Elizabeth Robb,
Director Leo Schmitz, Vicki Wilson for Director Nirav Shah, and Rick Krause for Acting
Director Gladyse Taylor. Also in attendance were Authority Executive Director John
Maki, Authority Deputy General Counsel Junaid Afeef, Authority Deputy Director
Randy Kurtz, Authority Program Supervisor Ron Reichgelt, Authority Program
Supervisor Greg Stevens, Authority Program Supervisor Shai Hoffman, Authority
Administrative Assistant Jude Lemrow, and other Authority staff members and guests.

 1. Minutes of the January 30, 2015 Budget Committee Meeting
Motion: Ms. Greene called for a motion to approve the minutes of the January 30, 2015
Budget Committee meeting. Ms. McCreary seconded the motion and it was approved by
unanimous voice vote.

2. Discussion of the Budget Committee Process
Authority Board members, Budget Committee designees, and Authority staff seated at
the table briefly introduced themselves.
Executive Director Maki said that he had previously served as an Authority Board
member. He said that he felt that the Budget Committee had become broken and that he
wanted to steer it in a new direction so as to provide more oversight at the policy level.
He said that he wanted policy to become more research driven. He said that a new
Strategic Opportunities Committee had been created to address some of the overlap in
programming and disconnects in policy among state agencies. He said that one of
Governor Bruce Rauner’s goals is to reduce the prison population in Illinois.
Ms. Hora said that in the past, many Budget Committee members came to meetings
under-prepared. She said that there is potential for more opportunities for new and
innovative pilot projects and that the Budget Committee should not be reduced to only
approving lists of continuation grants.
Executive Director Maki said that he wanted the Authority to become more active in
seeding innovation.
Ms. Greene said that a past problem had been that the Authority manages different
funding streams, not all of which are discussed at every Budget Committee meeting, and
there has been a rotating cast of participants at Budget Committee meetings, resulting in
meeting participants not being familiar with programs and issues. Budget Committee
members were also given little lead time to review meeting materials.
Authority staff member Jude Lemrow said that over time the Budget Committee had
asked for more and more information on designation recommendations, resulting in timeconsuming work for staff and lengthy documents for Board members to review. The
Budget Committee began to examine budget and program details of individual grants. He

Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority
Budget Committee Meeting

Page 2

 said that it appears that the committee’s new direction will have the Budget Committee
making more over-arching policy decisions about funding under the assumption that
details regarding grant and program viability will have been vetted by staff before
designation requests are made.
Program Supervisor Ron Reichgelt said that in the case of the victim services programs,
the Victim Services Ad Hoc Committee (VSAHC), consisting of various victim services
stakeholders, meets every three years to develop spending and programming priorities,
which Authority staff then implements. At the last VSAHC meeting, the decision was
made to continue current funding for current programs for 2014 through 2016. There will
be changes coming to this process in response to the new Grant Accountability and
Transparency Act (GATA) law requires that grants be awarded via a competitive process.
Ms. Hora said that it is important for the Budget Committee to know how grantees are
doing financially; audits and other financial information should be reviewed. It is a bad
idea to designate funds to unstable grantees.
Executive Director Maki said that the Budget Committee would not serve simply to
“rubber stamp” designation recommendations. He said that the Authority is developing a
new granting process that would address concerns sooner and shorten the time between
grant designation and execution. He said that federal and state fund work in different
ways and that new processes will require strategic thinking.
Ms. Greene said that an orientation meeting would be helpful.

3. Victims of Crime Act (VOCA)
Program Supervisor Ron Reichgelt, referring to the memo in the materials dated June 19,
2015 and regarding the FFY13 and FFY14 VOCA Plan Adjustments and the FFY15
VOCA Plan Introduction, said that the chart on Page 1 of the memo described FFY13 and
FFY14 VOCA funds recently returned to the Authority.
Mr. Reichgelt described FFY13, FFY14, and FFY15 designation recommendations as
presented in the memo. He called attention to a hard copy of Page 2 of the memo that had
been distributed to the Budget Committee members at their places identifying corrections
made to the chart beginning on Page 2 of the memo and describing recommended
designation amounts to Child Advocacy Center Services programs. The corrected table is

 4. Discussion of State Funded Programs
Executive Director Maki said that state grant funds are given to the Authority by the
Illinois General Assembly and are not subject to a request-for-proposals or other
competitive process. He said that since the Illinois SFY16 Budget had not yet been
approved, staff was unable to present pending state-funded grant designation requests. He
said that this situation would force the Budget Committee to meet on short notice when
the SFY16 Budget is approved so as to expedite the designation approval process for
affected state-funded grant programs.

Adjourn
Motion: Ms. Hora moved to adjourn the meeting. Ms. Greene seconded the motion and
it passed by unanimous voice vote. The meeting was adjourned at 9:51 a.m.

Call to Order and Roll Call
The Budget Committee of the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority met on
Thursday, August 6, 2015, at 300 West Adams, Suite 200, Large Conference Room,
Chicago, Illinois. Authority Budget Committee Chair Cynthia Hora (representing
Attorney General Lisa Madigan) called the meeting to order at 11:32 a.m. Authority
General Counsel Lisa Stephens called the roll. Other Authority members and designees
present were Philip Roy for State’s Attorney Anita Alvarez, Amy Campanelli, Kathryn
Dunne for Sheriff Tom Dart, Director Patrick Delfino, Director Kevin T. McClain,
Pamela Paziotopoulos, Authority Chair Hon. Elizabeth Robb, Director Leo Schmitz,
Director George H. Sheldon, Chief Rick Tanksley, and Paula Wolff. Also in attendance
were Authority Executive Director John Maki, Authority Deputy General Counsel Junaid
Afeef, Authority Program Supervisor Ron Reichgelt, Authority Program Supervisor Greg
Stevens, Authority Program Supervisor Mary Ratliff (via teleconference), Authority
Federal and State Grant Unit Administrative Assistant Jude Lemrow, and other Authority
staff members and guests.

Executive Director’s Remarks
Executive Director John Maki said that he was excited for this meeting. Having been a
Board Member in the past, he recognized that the Budget Committee (BC) is critical to
the Authority’s work. He said that he looked forward to making the BC process stronger,
more effective, and more strategic.

1. Public Comment
None.

 2. Authority Funding Overview
BC Chair Cynthia Hora, addressing the Current Programs Briefing Book included in the
meeting materials, said that staff would provide an overview of the Authority’s various
funding sources and that the Current Programs Briefing Book would serve as a good
future reference resource for Board / Budget Committee members.
Executive Director Maki said that the funding streams that the BC oversees are
complicated; they behave differently and have different requirements. It will take time to
learn all of the details. Funding comes from two general sources; the Federal Government
and State Government. Federal funds come from either Formula Awards or Discretionary
Awards. State funding, which is relatively new to the Authority in the last few years, has
been difficult to absorb into the Authority’s internal processes, which were designed to
handle federal funds. Federal funds often allow for greater Authority discretion in their
use, but the Authority serves as more of a pass-through agent for state funds. State funds
will be introduced once a State Budget is in place and they will act somewhat differently
than the federal funds. The bulk of the work that the Authority does in terms of research
and funding to strengthen and seed programs stems from federal programs.
Authority Program Supervisors Greg Stevens and Ron Reichgelt delivered a PowerPoint
presentation highlighting information provided in the Current Programs Briefing Book
included in the meeting materials. They addressed the following federal programs:
Federal Formula Programs
Justice Assistance Grants (JAG)

National Forensic Sciences Improvement Act
(NFSIA)
Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA)

 3. Budget Committee Mission and Role
Executive Director Maki said that part of the reason that he wanted to hold this
orientation meeting was a product of his prior experience as an Authority Board member.
He said that during that time, he was not clear as to what the BC’s role or mission was.
He said that there is a certain perception that he wants to address head-on and it revolves
around a question on the outside as to how funds are spent at the Authority; the
perception is that funds are awarded to whoever comes here asking for it. That
misperception comes from a fundamental breakdown in the Authority’s processes. When
the Authority was established, it was set up to do two primary things; strategic planning
and funding oversight. Nationwide, the Authority is still regarded as the gold standard of
this type of work. In the 1980’s and 1990’s the Authority did phenomenal work around
information systems, crime mapping, funding, etc. Over time, the planning function
eroded. The federal programs require a degree of planning and the Authority has been
very responsive to that, but those planning processes did not filter up to the Board’s level;
the Board did not quite know what the plans were. At the budget level, this was
problematic because one of the BC’s jobs is to determine whether or not the programs
recommended for funding designations fit within the priorities and a large part of this a
consideration of what research has to offer regarding program performance. As a board
and as an agency, the Authority needs to return to a model of having research informing
funding and funding informing research. The BC plays a central oversight role in this
model.
Executive Director Maki said that under current rules, the BC is supposed to review the
Authority’s general operating budget. That funding has been cut severely in recent years,
resulting in a skeletal operation. The BC also oversees information systems funding. The
BC will review fiscal reports and procedures. He said that he wanted the BC to have
more input to the General Assembly and the Governor’s Office.
Planning – Executive Director Maki said that in the past, the Board and staff worked
together on planning. There were some attempts to do this in recent years, but they did
not quite as effective as they could have been. To address this, the new Strategic
Opportunities Committee (SOC) has been created and will be chaired by Paula Wolff.
The SOC will be tasked with developing priorities and goals and how research will
support those goals. The SOC will develop a plan to be presented to and approved by the
Board that will lay out the framework for how the Board and the Agency should proceed
and for how the BC should operate within that framework. He said that ideally, the
representatives of the justice system that make up the Board would discuss larger
overarching issues. Since the Authority has lost some of that high-level functionality, the
BC has become almost a review committee; the BC often discusses finer details of
specific program funding recommendations. However, the Authority has staff dedicated
to performing such reviews internally, so that when a designation recommendation is

Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority
Budget Committee Meeting
August 6, 2015
Page 3

 presented to the BC, the recommendation has already been technically vetted. He said
that staff often does not present to the BC programs that they no longer recommend for
funding partly because specific funding periods had been built into the funding
recommendations and that is something that has been lost.
Budget Committee Grant Recommendation Report Template - Executive Director Maki
called attention to Budget Committee Grant Recommendation Report template included
in the meeting materials. The template is designed to illustrate the long-term plan for
funding for the recommended designation and the grantee’s plan to address program
sustainability.

4. Grant Administration and Process
Mr. Reichgelt, addressing a PowerPoint slide, said that some of the Authority’s longstanding process will change with the implementation of the new Grant Accountability
and Transparency Act (GATA). He described the steps per the following outline:
1. Budget Committee Designation
2. Internal Review:
A. Monitor Review
B. Fiscal review
C. Legal Review
3. Execution of Interagency Agreement
4. Grant Monitoring:
A. Collection and Review of Data Reports
B. Collection and Review of Fiscal Reports
C. Disbursal of Funds
D. Site Visits
E. Technical Assistance
F. Closeout
Mr. Reichgelt said that the order of these step might change as the process is tweaked, but
these are the basic steps that every grant must go through. Information gathered during
this process informs future staff recommendations to either continue or discontinue
funding.
Executive Director Maki, in response to a question by Rebecca Janowitz (representing
the Cook County Board), said that there are two main ways that a program comes to be
selected for funding; a request-for-proposals (RFP) process or a needs-based analysis. He
said that in the future, program funding will be more RFP-driven.

Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority
Budget Committee Meeting
August 6, 2015
Page 4

 General Counsel Lisa Stephens said that needs-based proposals often come from the
Board itself.
Grant Accountability and Transparency Act (GATA) – Deputy General Counsel Junaid
Afeef said that GATA was enacted to increase accountability and to reduce
administrative burdens on both grantor agencies and grantees. To do this, Illinois has
adopted many of the rules that the federal government uses for its grant administration
programs and new rules will be developed wherever the federal rules prove to not be a
good fit. The federal rules will be modified so that they can be implemented for statelevel discretionary and pass-through grants from the legislature. The Single Audit
Commission will review these modifications and make further changes as necessary.
Grants funded pursuant to GATA will be limited to three years of funding without being
subject to a new RFP. Other specific rules have not yet been adopted at this time.

5. Grant Recovery
Deputy General Counsel Afeef said that Illinois has the Grant Funds Recovery Act
(GFRA). He said that until 2012, thanks to a combination of the Authority’s staff,
processes, and the types of grants that it has administered, the Authority never had a need
to implement the GFRA’s provisions to recover unspent or misspent funds. The GFRA
requires that any unspent funds must be returned within 45 days of the end of a grant. In
2013, the Authority absorbed the Illinois Violence Prevention Authority (IVPA). The
IVPA oversaw a program called the Neighborhood Recovery Initiative (NRI). The
Authority was tasked with taking on the administration of NRI and recovering the
unspent or misspent NRI funds. As of this meeting, the Authority has recovered
approximately $4 million in unspent or misspent funds from the NRI programs. All of
these issues were legacy issues from the IVPA’s administration of these programs.
Deputy General Counsel Afeef said that there are two processes used to recover these
funds:
•

Informal Hearing Process – When Authority staff identifies unrecovered unspent
or misspent funds, the first step is an informal hearing. Authority staff meets with
grantee staff to try to resolve the issue and work out a repayment plan. Most such
issues are resolved at the informal hearing

•

Formal Hearing Process – The Authority does not have administrative law judges
because the Authority has never had to deal with formal hearings in the past. The
Authority entered into an intergovernmental agreement (IGA) with the Illinois
Department of Public Health (IDPH) for the use of IDPH’s administrative rules
and administrative law judges to conduct formal hearings. All such judgements
are turned over to the Illinois Attorney General’s Office as necessary.

Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority
Budget Committee Meeting
August 6, 2015
Page 5

 Deputy General Counsel Afeef said that the Authority never settles for less than the
amounts owed. Most repayments are planned over a three- or six-month period. The
implementation of GATA will help the Authority manage grants in a way that makes it
very unlikely that it will have to pursue these processes in the future.

6. Justice Assistance Grants (JAG)
Executive Director Maki, referring to the memo in the materials dated August 6, 2015
and regarding the FFY11 JAG Plan Adjustments, said that in response to a spike in gun
violence a few years ago, a panel of national experts on gun violence was consulted to
form a strategy to combat gun violence. Authority staff has become aware of
communities throughout Illinois that want to learn about these strategies. This
designation would support a conference in Peoria, Illinois that will host representatives of
jurisdictions with the highest levels of gun violence so that they can learn what
techniques have been proven effective in combating gun violence in other communities.
The MacArthur and Joyce Foundations have agreed to provide food and beverage
services for this event.
Executive Director Maki, in response to a question by Director McClain, said that the
conference would attract police chiefs, county executives, mayors, probation officers,
community leaders, prosecutors, etc.
Director McClain said that, for future reference, the Illinois Law Enforcement Training
and Standards Board (ILETSB) has mobile team training systems throughout Illinois. All
law enforcement training must go through those mobile teams to obtain ILETSB
certification. He requested that the Authority involve the ILETSB’s mobile team system
in future law enforcement training programs so that participating officers can receive
proper certification.
Motion: Director Schmitz moved to approve the JAG FFY11 Plan Adjustment. Director
McClain seconded the motion and it passed by unanimous voice vote.

Adjourn
Motion: Ms. Dunne moved to adjourn the meeting. Director Delfino seconded the
motion and it passed by unanimous voice vote. The meeting was adjourned at 1:10 p.m.

boundaries. These cooperative units and their local governing boards work to target the most serious local drug
problems, emphasizing interdiction and the disruption of distribution of controlled substances.
Priorities
These programs address the Law Enforcement Priority to “Support programs which provide law enforcement
agencies throughout the state with the necessary means to deter, combat, and investigate crime through
strategies, staffing, training, and equipment that promotes public safety and the common good.”
Performance Assessment
The units recommended funding have no reporting or performance issues and greatly exceed the matching
funds requirement each year.
Past Performance
These multi-jurisdictional units continue to meet or exceed currently defined performance objectives, as
reflected in cumulative data from calendar year 2014 in the table below.
During 2014, the MEG/TFs made 4,411 drug seizures, and seized 313,993 grams of controlled substances and

Program Name:

Young Offender Re-Entry Program – Illinois Department of Juvenile Justice (IDJJ)

Funding Source:

JAG FFY13; - $367,200 Total Federal; 25% Cash Match Amount

Program Description
The need for this program was identified at the Authority’s 2000 statewide planning summit and first funded
out of the Byrne Anti-Drug Abuse Act (ADAA) fund and has been continued with JAG funding.
Program Activities
The Juvenile Justice Reentry program provides direct pre- and post-release service staff to develop and
implement transitional care plans for youth leaving the Department of Juvenile Justice and returning to District
One Chicago. Services include enrollment in school, home visits with family, obtaining identification and
linkage to services.
Priorities
The program addresses the State Corrections priority to, “Support programs which allow state and local
correctional facilities to apply proven and innovative programs to assist in meeting the needs of incarcerated
persons and to maintain the safety and security of the institution, staff and inmate population.”
Performance Assessment
Because of the extensive background checks necessary to work with juveniles in a correctional setting, the
process of hiring replacement staff is lengthy and sometimes necessitates agreement extensions to fully expend
allocated funds. Despite some staff shortages, the program continues to meet performance and reporting
requirements.
Past Performance
The program reported the following activity during the current agreement reporting period of October 2014 –
June 30, 2015:
Number of juvenile male offenders admitted to the program

110

Number of treatment plans completed

110

Total number of youth leaving the program

Funding Source:

NFSIA FFY15

Program Description
NFSIA is a federal formula award. The Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority (the Authority) is proposing to use
Federal Fiscal Year 2015 (FFY15) NFSIA funding to support ongoing improvements at the Cook County Medical
Examiner’s Office and nine crime labs across Illinois. These improvements will be made through agreements with the
DuPage County Crime Lab (DuPage), the Northeastern Illinois Regional Crime Lab (NIRCL), the Office of the Cook
County Medical Examiner’s (CCME) and the Illinois State Police (ISP). As of September 9, 2015 the Authority has not
yet been notified of the total value of the NFSIA FFY15 award.
Program Activities
NFSIA funds are principally used to purchase new lab equipment and to support required proficiency testing, lab
accreditation and conference travel. In addition, staff overtime and contractual toxicology testing will help labs keep up
with the demand for testing.
Priorities
The NFSIA application guidance indicates that the purpose of the program is to, “… to help improve the quality and
timeliness of forensic science and medical examiner services. Among other things, funds may be used to eliminate a
backlog in the analysis of forensic evidence and to train and employ forensic laboratory personnel, as needed, to
eliminate such a backlog.”

Funding Source:

RSAT FFY15, $232,921 Total Federal; 25% Cash Match

Program Description
RSAT is federal formula award, which the Authority applies administers as part of its role as the Department of
Justice State Administering Agency (SAA) for Illinois. Ten percent of each RSAT award must be made
available to local corrections. In develop recommendations for the use of the 90% of RSAT funds available for
state agency use, Authority grant staff consult with the Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC) and the
Illinois Department of Juvenile Justice (IDJJ) regarding their assessment of the great resource needs that can be
met with RSAT funding.
Program Activities
RSAT funds may only be used for corrections-based assessment and treatment of offenders. Treatment must be
provided during the last six months of an offender’s sentence. The programs recommended for funding provide
screening and assessment for juvenile males at the Illinois Youth Center (IYC) at St. Charles, as well as juvenile
drug treatment at IYC Harrisburg, IYC St. Charles and IYC Warrenville. RSAT funding will also support
ongoing implementation of the Dual Diagnosis Treatment program for female offenders at the Logan
Correctional facility. All treatment and assessment services are evidence-based and are provided through
vendor contracts that are competitively bid and meet all staff education and certification standards.
Priorities
According to the RSAT application guidance, “The goal of the RSAT Program is to break the cycle of drugs
and violence by reducing the demand for, use, and trafficking of illegal drugs. RSAT enhances the capability of
states and units of local and tribal government to provide residential substance abuse treatment for
incarcerated inmates; prepares offenders for their reintegration into the communities from which they came by
incorporating reentry planning activities into treatment programs; and assists offenders and their communities
through the reentry process through the delivery of community-based treatment and other broad-based
aftercare services. Treatment practices/services should be, to the extent possible, evidence-based.”

support programs previously funded through VAWA. The following are continuation
designations for previously funded VAWA programs which staff deem successful. The
designations recommended in this memo and future designations will be consistent with the
priorities set forth in the VAWA FFY13 – FFY16 Multi-Year Plan.
Staff recommends designating funds to entities and programs as described below. Further details
are provided in the attached Grant Recommendation Reports.

BUDGET COMMITTEE GRANT RECOMMENDATION REPORT
Program Name:

Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) Program

Funding Source:

$235,628 - Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) FFY14

Program Description
Under PREA, a State must certify to the federal Department of Justice (DOJ) that it is in compliance with the national
PREA standards or else the State is subject to the loss or reallocation of specified funding. Beginning in FFY 2014, if a
State cannot certify full compliance, it will lose five percent of any DOJ grants that “may provide amounts to States for
prison purposes” unless it provides an assurance that it will use five percent of such funds for the purpose of enabling
the State to adopt and achieve full compliance with the standards, so that a certification of compliance may be
submitted in future years. Since Illinois is not in compliance with PREA, 4.75 percent of the FFY14 VAWA award, or
$235,628, must be designated to programing to come into compliance.

Program Activities
Staff recommends designating $235,628 in FFY14 discretionary funds to IDJJ to allow PREA-certified juvenile facility
auditors to audit juvenile facilities. IDJJ would utilize this funding to meet other PREA mandates such as covering training
development, including video trainings for both staff and youth, and/or taking any remedial measures identified in the
audit.

Goals
To bring the state juvenile detention centers into compliance with the PREA.

RE:

FFY15 Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) Sexual Assault Service
Program (SASP) Plan Introduction

This memo describes the VAWA SASP FFY15 Plan Introduction.
VAWA SASP FFY15 INTRODUCTION
The FFY15 VAWA SASP award to Illinois is $459,058, with $22,953 set aside for
administration purposes. The designations recommended in this memo and future designations
will be consistent with the priorities set forth in the VAWA FFY14 – FFY16 Multi-Year Plan.

RECOMMENDED DESIGNATIONS
On October 22 and 23, 2013, the Authority convened the Victim Service Ad Hoc Committee
(VSAHC) to review past priorities and define new ones for the use of STOP VAWA funds. The
VSAHC recommended that FFY14 - FFY16 VAWA funds be used principally to continue to
support programs previously funded through VAWA. The following are continuation
designations for previously funded VAWA programs which staff deem successful. The
designations recommended in this memo and future designations will be consistent with the
priorities set forth in the VAWA FFY13 – FFY16 Multi-Year Plan.
Illinois Coalition Against Sexual Assault (ICASA): The Sexual Assault Services Formula Grant
Program (SASP Formula Grant Program) directs grant dollars to States and Territories to assist
them in supporting rape crisis centers and other nonprofit, nongovernmental organizations that
provide core services, direct intervention, and related assistance to victims of sexual assault.
Rape crisis centers and other nonprofit organizations such as dual programs providing both
domestic violence and sexual violence intervention services play a vital role in assisting sexual
assault victims through the healing process, as well as assisting victims through the medical,
criminal justice, and other social support systems. As in previous years, staff recommends that
the FFY15 VAWA SASP award’s grant-use funds ($436,105) be designated to ICASA to be
subgranted to ICASA’s partner agencies through a request-for-proposals process.
Staff will be available at the meeting to answer any questions.

__________________________________________________________________________________________________
Program Summary (State the problem and supporting data; identify target population and intended consequences)
The Sexual Assault Services Program (SASP) was created by the Violence Against Women and Department of Justice
Reauthorization Act of 2005, and is the first Federal funding stream solely dedicated to the provision of direct intervention
and related assistance for victims of sexual assault. Women and men of all ages, as well as children, can be victims of
sexual assault. The perpetrator can be a relative, acquaintance or a stranger. Nearly half of all women and one in five men
have experienced some form of sexual violence in their lifetime. Also, nearly one in five (18.3 percent) women and one in
71 men (1.4 percent) in the U.S. have been raped at some time in their lives.
For many victims, it may take years to recover from the physical and psychological trauma caused by rape and other
forms of sexual violence. To heal from the trauma, survivors often need support from family and friends, as well as
critical direct intervention and related assistance from victim-centered social service organizations such as rape crisis
centers, through 24-hour sexual assault hotlines, crisis intervention, and medical and criminal justice accompaniment.
SASP directs grant dollars to states to assist them in supporting rape crisis centers that provide core services, direct
intervention, and related assistance to victims of sexual assault. Rape crisis centers and other nonprofit organizations such
as dual programs providing both domestic violence and sexual violence intervention services play vital roles in assisting
sexual assault victims through the healing process, as well as assisting victims through the medical, criminal justice, and
other social support systems. Funds provided through the SASP program are designed to supplement other funding
sources directed at addressing sexual assault.
In Illinois, VAWA SASP funds are distributed to local sexual assault service providers through an interagency agreement
between the Authority and the Illinois Coalition Against Sexual Assault (ICASA). Under the SASP program, ICASA will
make funds available to 32 member agencies for the provision of hotline, advocacy, counseling and outreach services to
adults and children. The funded agencies will be selected through a competitive application process in which applicants
will be evaluated based on demonstrated need in the service area, previous and proposed performance, reasonableness of
program plan, consistency of budget and program plan and compliance with ICASA’s service standards.
