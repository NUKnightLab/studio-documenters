WHEREAS, Clyde Collins Snow, Ph.D., received an Associate of Arts Degree from New Mexico
Military Institute in 1947, a Bachelor of Science Degree from Eastern New Mexico University in 1951, a
Master of Science Degree from Texas Technical University in 1955, a Doctor of Philosophy from
University of Arizona in 1967 and Doctor of Science (Hon) from John Jay College of Criminal Justice in
1993; and
WHEREAS, in 1979, Dr. Snow retired from the Federal Aviation Administration to serve as an
independent consultant in forensic anthropology; during his FAA career, he conducted research on human
factor problems in aviation safety and participated in the investigation of general and commercial aviation
accidents; in addition, he has lectured extensively to law enforcement, university and forensic science
groups on his specialty of human skeletal identification; he has acted as the Forensic Anthropology
Consultant to the Cook County Medical Examiner since 1979; and
WHEREAS, during his career, Dr. Snow has served as a consultant in nearly 3000 cases involving the
identification and determination of the cause of death of skeletonized victims; his cases include the 1979
American Airlines DC-10 crash, the John Wayne Gacy serial murders, and the Green River murders; in
1985, at the request of the Simon Weisenthal Institute, he headed a team of U. S. forensic scientists that
went to Brazil to aid in the identification of the skeleton of the notorious Nazi war criminal, Dr. Josef
Mengele; and
WHEREAS, in 1984, Dr. Snow went to Argentina to serve as a consultant to that nation’s National
Commission on the Disappearance of Persons (CONADEP). The CONADEP mission was to determine
the fate of thousands of Argentineans who were abducted, tortured and murdered by the military “Death
Squads” between 1976 and 1983 when the country was under the rule of a military dictatorship; in 1985,
he testified as a prosecution expert in the trial of the nine generals and admirals who ruled Argentina
during the period of military repression; his testimony was the first instance in which forensic scientific
evidence was used in a human rights trial; six of the nine defendants were convicted; since then, he has
performed similar missions in Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Cambodia, Chile, El Salvador, Ethiopia,
Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Panama, Peru, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Venezuela, Iraqi Kurdistan,
Democratic Republic of Congo (former Zaire) and Zimbabwe; and
WHEREAS, over the years Dr. Snow has founded and trained forensic anthropology teams in Argentina,
Chili, Guatemala and Peru; these teams not only conduct human rights investigations in their own
countries but have been called to aid in such investigations throughout the world (34 countries, so far); in
2002, he helped found the Latin American Association of Forensic Anthropologists and serves as its
Honorary President; in June 2004, in recognition of his work in the investigations of the Disappeared, he
was invited to return to Argentina as a guest of honor of the City of Buenos Aires where he was honored
with a medal and diploma making him an honorary citizen; and

ITEM #1 cont’d
WHEREAS, in 1992, Dr. Snow served in Geneva as a U. S. Delegate to the United Nations Human
Rights Commission; he has also completed several UN-sponsored missions to Former Yugoslavia to
collect forensic evidence to be used in war crimes trials by the UN War Crimes Tribunal; in March 1998,
he testified as an expert witness at the Tribunal in the trial of the Serb defendant charged with the
extrajudicial execution of nearly 200 unarmed Croatian hospital patients whose remains Dr. Snow found
in a mass grave near Vukovar, Croatia in October 1992; this was significant because the Vukovar grave
was the first forensically documented incident of “ethnic cleansing” in Former Yugoslavia, and Dr.
Snow’s testimony was the first given by a forensic expert witness before a UN War Crimes Tribunal; in
Baghdad in November 2006, Dr. Snow testified as an expert in the trial of Saddam Hussein and his codefendants for their genocidal campaign against the Iraqi Kurds; and
WHEREAS, in his role of Forensic Anthropology Consultant to the Cook County Office of the Medical
Examiner, Dr. Snow has helped train staff Forensic Pathologists, residents in Forensic Pathology training
at the Office as well as countless medical students and visiting residents and physicians in forensic
anthropology by didactic lecture and hands-on teaching.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that I, Todd H. Stroger, on behalf of the more than five
million residents of Cook County, do hereby express deep appreciation for the dedication and leadership
exemplified by Dr. Clyde Collins Snow in his capacity as Forensic Anthropology Consultant to Cook
County and in his long, distinguished and multifaceted career, and may a copy of this Resolution be
tendered to Dr. Clyde Collins Snow herewith.

Class 6b, Class C, Class 7a, Class7b, Class 8, Class 9, Class S or Class L of this section.

Class 5b. All real estate used for industrial purposes as defined herein and not included
in any other class.

(7)

Class 6b. Real estate used primarily for industrial purposes, consisting of all newly
constructed buildings or other structures, including the land upon which they are situated;
or abandoned property, including the land upon which such property is situated; or all
buildings and other structures which are substantially rehabilitated to the extent such
rehabilitation has added to their value, including qualified land related to the
rehabilitation. Land qualifies when the rehabilitation adds vertical or horizontal square
footage to the improvements. The amount of land eligible for the incentive shall be in
such proportion as the square footage added by the rehabilitation bears to the total square
footage of the improvements on the parcel.
a.

An applicant must obtain from the municipality in which the real estate is located
or the County Board if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, an
Ordinance or Resolution expressly stating that the municipality or County Board,
as the case may be, has determined that the incentive provided by Class 6b is
necessary for development to occur on that specific real estate and that the
municipality or County Board, as the case may be, supports and consents to the
Class 6b application to the Assessor. A certified copy of the Ordinance or
Resolution need not be filed at the time of filing the Class 6b eligibility
application with the Assessor, but must be filed with the Assessor no later than
the date an assessment appeal is filed to request the class change to Class 6b. If
the Resolution is not filed at the time of the eligibility application, the applicant

case may be, confirming that a Resolution or Ordinance supporting the incentive
has been requested.

b.

members of the County Board from the affected districts.

c.

In the instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned
property as defined herein, the municipality or the County Board, as the case may
be, may still determine that special circumstances justify finding that the property
is deemed "abandoned" for purpose of Class 6b. The finding of abandonment,
along with the specification of the special circumstances, shall be included in the
Resolution or Ordinance supporting and consenting to the Class 6bapplication.
Not withstanding the foregoing, special circumstances may not be determined to
justify finding that a property is deemed "abandoned" where:

ITEM #7 cont’d
A.

There has been a purchase for value and the buildings and other
structures have not been vacant and unused prior to such purchase; or

B.

There has been no purchase for value and the buildings and other
structures have been vacant and unused for less than 24 continuous
months.

Such Resolution or Ordinance shall be included with the eligibility application. If
the Ordinance or Resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the County
Board is required to validate such a finding that the property is deemed
"abandoned" for purposes of Class6b, and a Resolution to that effect shall be
included with the Class 6beligibility application. The applicant must obtain the
municipal enabling Ordinance with the required finding of special circumstances
and present such municipal Ordinance to the Board of Commissioners of Cook
County prior to its determination as to whether it will validate such a finding that
the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b and provide a
County Resolution to that effect. A certified copy of an Ordinance or Resolution
finding that special circumstances exist, as well as a certified copy of a County
Ordinance or Resolution validating such a finding that the property is deemed
"abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b need not be filed at the time of filing the
Class 6b eligibility application with the Assessor, but must be filed with the
Assessor no later than the date an assessment appeal is filed to request the class
change to Class 6b. If the Resolution is not filed at the time of the eligibility
application, the applicant shall instead file, at that time, a letter from the
municipality or the County as the case may be, confirming that a Resolution or
Ordinance regarding special circumstances has been requested.
d.

This classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the date such new
construction (excluding demolition, if any) or such substantial rehabilitation was
completed and initially assessed, or in the case of abandoned property, from the
date of substantial reoccupancy. This incentive may be renewed during the last
year a property is entitled to a 16 percent assessment level, if the following
requirements are met:
1.

The taxpayer notifies the Assessor's Office of intent to request renewal of
the incentive from the municipality, or the County Board if the real estate
is located in an unincorporated area;

2.

The municipality in which the real estate is located or the County Board,
if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, adopts a Resolution
expressly stating that the municipality or County Board, as the case may
be, has determined that the industrial use of the property is necessary and
beneficial to the local economy, and supports and consents to renewal of
the Class 6b; and

3.

e.

The number of renewal periods is not limited as long as the property continues to
apply and qualify for Class 6b. Any property owner that applies for Class 6b
treatment on or before the adoption date of this Ordinance change will be eligible
for this renewal term at the end of their original incentive period subject to the
above requirements. If, on November 23, 1999, a property is receiving Class 6b
treatment, but the assessment level is higher than 16 percent, that taxpayer may
apply for renewal as outlined above and receive a 16 percent assessment level for
the prescribed period beginning after the filing and approval of the Resolution
and renewal application. However, if, as of November 23, 1999, the taxpayer's
assessment is higher than 16 percent and the taxpayer is granted a renewal of the
incentive for subsequent years, no reduction of the current assessment level based
on renewal of the incentive will be granted.

f.

The notice of intent to request renewal which is filed with the Assessor's Office
will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the County Board
for distribution to members of the County Board from the effected districts.

g.

If no renewal is obtained, the incentive shall be phased out over the next two
years, pursuant to Section 74-64.After expiration of the last incentive period, the
real estate shall revert to the applicable classification under this division.

h.

Additionally, for newly constructed or substantially rehabilitated buildings and
other structures to qualify for Class 6b classification, an eligibility application
must be made to the Assessor within one year prior to the commencement of
such new construction or substantial rehabilitation. With respect to abandoned
property, the eligibility application must be made to the Assessor prior to the
commencement of the reoccupation of the vacant and unused property.

i.

The Assessor may adopt rules consistent with this subsection necessary to ensure
proper review of all factors relevant to determine eligibility for the benefits
provided under Class 6b.

j.

The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports
by all Class 6b recipients as to the use of the property and the number of persons
employed at the Class 6bsite. Such reports shall be verified. Failure to file such
reports within the time established by the Assessor's rules shall result in loss of
the incentive for the period relating to the non filing.

k.

Upon enactment of this subsection through April 1, 2011, properties may be
granted Class 6b status in cases where the property has not been abandoned or
been abandoned for less than 24 consecutive months.

Class C. Real estate which is to be used for industrial or commercial purposes, including
abandoned property, as defined in Section 74-62, including the land upon which such

Remediation Letter" from the site remediation program.

Further Remediation Letter" confirming achievement of the remediation
objectives based on the industrial or commercial use.

b.

The owner of the property is rendered ineligible for the Class C classification by
having previously owned or operated the site, directly or indirectly, or having
been a partner or being associated through a family or business relationship with
anyone who has owned or operated the site, which ownership or operation caused
the contamination which was remediated pursuant to a site remediation. A
present owner who can successfully demonstrate that the owner was not

c.

An applicant must obtain from the municipality in which the real estate is located
or the County Board if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, an

request renewal of the incentive from the municipality, or the County
Board if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area;

2.

The municipality in which the real estate is located or the County Board,
if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, adopts a Resolution

with the Office of the Assessor before the expiration of the 16 percent
assessment level period.

The number of renewal periods is not limited as long as the property continues to
apply and qualify for Class C. Any property which applies for Class C treatment
on or before the adoption date of the Ordinance from which this division is
derived will be eligible for this renewal term at the end of their original incentive
period subject to the above requirements. The notice of intent to request renewal
which is filed with the Assessor's Office will be forwarded by the Assessor's

assessment level is higher than 16percent, that taxpayer may apply for renewal as
outlined above and receive a 16percent assessment level for the prescribed period
beginning after the filing and approval of the Resolution and renewal application.
However, if, as of that effective date, the taxpayer's assessment is higher than 16
percent and the taxpayer is granted a renewal of the incentive for subsequent
years, no reduction of the current assessment level based on renewal of the
incentive will be granted. If no renewal is obtained, the incentive shall be phased
out over the next two years, pursuant to Section 74-64. After such ten-year period

expired, the commercial Class C incentive will expire. The incentive
classification will not be subject to renewal and the real estate shall revert to the
applicable classification under this division.

The Assessor shall review the application and supporting documentation to
determine eligibility for the Class C classification. The Assessor may adopt rules
consistent with the foregoing necessary to ensure proper review of all factors
relevant to determine initial and continued eligibility for the benefits provided
under the Class C classification.

beginning after the filing and approval of the Resolution and renewal application.

the number of persons employed at the Class L site. Failure to file such reports
within the time established by the Assessor's rules may result in loss of the
