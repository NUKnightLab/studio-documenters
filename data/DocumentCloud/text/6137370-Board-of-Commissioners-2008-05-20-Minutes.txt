BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF COOK COUNTY
PRESIDENT
RECOMMENDATION OF FOUR ADDITIONAL NAMES TO THE OFFICE OF
INTERIM BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE COOK COUNTY BUREAU OF HEALTH
Transmitting a Communication, dated May 15, 2008 from
TODD H. STROGER, President, Cook County Board of Commissioners
Dear Commissioners:
With the restructuring and reorganization of the Bureau of Health, the passage of adequate new revenue
found in the 2008 Budget and an agreement on the legislation needed to establish an independent hospital
governance, the County Board, under my leadership, is poised to take the next step, in a series of positive
steps, to preserve the Cook County Health Care System.
As this process moves forward, it is important to affirm that all of the parties involved have worked with
genuine concern for the long-term well-being of our health system. The organizations which participated
in the Nominating Committee did a tremendous job in forwarding a solid group of individuals.
Additionally, I believe the County Board did their duty in analyzing the nominees presented by this
administration. This is not a perfect process (and it is not enough to merely vote “no”), but it is the
process we must use to move forward in order to ensure that our children’s generation has universal
access to quality health care in Cook County.

6026

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 20, 2008
Based on the amendments passed by the Board to the Cook County Health and Hospitals System
Ordinance, I am transmitting the names of four additional persons to serve:
•

David Ansell, MD, MPH: Chief Medical Officer, Associate Dean and Vice President of
Hospital Affairs, Rush University Medical Center;

•

Warren L. Batts: Retired Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Premark International;

•

Sister Sheila Lyne, RSM: President and Chief Executive Officer, Mercy Hospital
Medical Center; and

•

Luis Munoz, MD: Director of Occupational Medicine, WorkCare Medical Management

Their vast experience in health care administration, as well as their backgrounds in both the public and
private sectors, will be much-needed assets. I am confident that these four individuals will bring
professional and independent oversight and I therefore urge the Board of Commissioners to provide for
their swift confirmation.
_________________________
In accordance with Cook County Code Section 2-108(z)(1) Amendment or suspension of rules,
Commissioner Daley, seconded by Commissioner Silvestri, moved to suspend Section 2-108(h)(1) Prior
notice to public; agendas. The motion carried unanimously.
Commissioner Suffredin, seconded by Commissioner Daley, moved that the communication be referred
to the Committee on Legislation, Intergovernmental & Veterans Relations. (Comm. No. 294146). The
motion carried unanimously.

completion of residency training in emergency medicine at the University of Chicago in 1980; and
WHEREAS, Dr. Simon served from 1980 through 1988 as an attending physician at the University of

Bureau of Health Services, running the largest Department of Emergency Medicine in the country with
over one quarter of a million patients annually and almost 100 faculty and 54 residents; and
WHEREAS, under Dr. Simon’s leadership, the Department of Emergency Medicine at Cook County
Hospital became a pioneer in developing Observation Units linked to emergency departments. These

doing international work listed with an A+ rating; and
WHEREAS, in December 2006, Cook County Board President Todd H. Stroger appointed Dr. Simon the
Interim Bureau Chief for the Cook County Bureau of Health Services; and

Simon fought to preserve the quality of care at the heart of the Bureau’s mission while meeting the
Board’s fiscal mandates; and

provide for those who cannot pay by getting reimbursed from those who can. Medicaid and private
insurance billings increased dramatically under his leadership, helping to reduce the burden on the overall
system; and
WHEREAS, under Dr. Simon’s leadership, the pathology labs of all facilities reduced turnaround time
for the most common tests, helping to significantly impact delays in service; and

6028

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 20, 2008
WHEREAS, under Dr. Simon’s leadership, overtime in bureau pharmacies was cut nearly in half and
pharmaceutical costs were reduced by 20%; and
WHEREAS, significant changes were made to the financial systems of the Bureau, leading to the
identification of several sources of health care funding that was earned but not collected by the County;
and
WHEREAS, despite the challenges and the resistance to change, Dr. Simon was able to maintain the
highest possible level of service to the greatest number of County residents; and
WHEREAS, in recognition of the hard work of the men and women and the Bureau of Health Services
and in recognition of the tremendous need for these services, Dr. Simon helped lead the successful fight
for fair and sustainable funding for Cook County’s Health Services.

AN AMENDMENT TO THE ORDINANCE ESTABLISHING
THE COOK COUNTY HEALTH AND HOSPITALS SYSTEM
Sec. 38-76.

Members of the System Board.

(a)
One of the ten (10) Directors shall be the Chairperson of the Health and Hospitals
Committee of the County Board who shall serve as an ex-officio member with no voting rights.
This Director shall serve as a liaison between the County Board and the System Board.
(b)
follows:

The remaining nine (9) Directors of the System Board shall be appointed and removed as

(1)

For the initial Directors, the County Board shall approve or reject each of the names
submitted by the President within fourteen (14) days from the date the President
submitted the names, or at the next regular meeting of the County Board held subsequent
to the fourteen (14) day period. Where the County Board rejects the President's selection
of any name for the office of Director, the President shall within seven (7) days select a
replacement name from the remaining names on the initial list of twenty (20) names.
There is no limit on the number of names the County Board may reject. The County
Board shall exercise good faith in approving the initial Directors as soon as reasonably
practicable. In the event, the twenty (20) names initially submitted to the President by
the Nominating Committee are exhausted before the County Board approves nine (9)
names, the President shall direct the Nominating Committee to reconvene and to select
and submit an additional three (3) names for each Director still to be appointed.
a.

Of the nine (9) Directors first appointed:
1.

Four (4) Directors shall serve a term of three (3) years as designated by
the President in his recommendation to the County Board; and,

2.

Five (5) Directors shall serve a term of five (5) years as designated by the
President in his recommendation to the County Board.

successor is appointed. Any appointed Director shall be eligible for
reappointment, but no appointed Director shall be eligible to serve more than two
consecutive five-year terms.

(2)

d.

Upon the expiration of an appointed Director’s term, the successor Director shall
be appointed in the same manner as the process set forth above for the
nomination, selection and appointment of initial Directors; provided, however,
that the Nominating Committee shall recommend three (3) names for each
Director position to be filled at that time.

e.

Any appointed Director may be removed for incompetence, malfeasance, neglect
of duty, willful or negligent failure to perform assigned duties, culpable
inefficiency in performing assigned duties, or any cause which renders the
Director unfit for the position. The President or one-third (1/3) of the members of
the County Board shall provide written notice to that Director of the proposed
removal of that Director from office; which notice shall state the specific grounds
which constitute cause for removal. The Director in receipt of such notice may
request to appear before the County Board and present reasons in support of his
or her retention. Thereafter, the County Board shall vote upon whether there are
sufficient grounds to remove that Director from office. The President shall notify
the subject Director of the final action of the County Board.

In the event of a vacancy in an appointed Director position on the System Board, the
President may recommend a replacement name to the County Board for its approval from
the remaining names on the most recent list of names recommended by the Nominating
Committee. In the alternative, the President may direct that the Nominating Committee
reconvene to prepare a new list of three (3) names for the vacancy within thirty (30) days
of the President’s request. The successor Director shall then be appointed in the same
manner set forth above for the selection and appointment of initial Directors.
a.

b.

A vacancy shall occur upon the:

Resignation,

2.

Death,

3.

Conviction of a felony, or

compensation for their service but shall be reimbursed for reasonable and necessary expenses as approved
by the County Board.
(d)

Directors shall have a fiduciary duty to the CCHHS and the County.

Effective date: This amendment shall be effective immediately.

PROPOSED RESOLUTIONS
The following item was deferred at the April 9, 2008 and May 7, 2008 Board Meetings:
Submitting a Proposed Resolution sponsored by
ANTHONY J. PERAICA, WILLIAM M. BEAVERS, GREGG GOSLIN, JOSEPH MARIO MORENO,
PETER N. SILVESTRI, JOAN PATRICIA MURPHY, DEBORAH SIMS, ROBERT B. STEELE and
ELIZABETH “LIZ” DOODY GORMAN, County Commissioners
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
RESOLUTION CONCERNING REMOVAL OF THE PUBLIC DEFENDER
WHEREAS, the office of the public defender is an office created by state statute, all as set forth in
Article 3, Division 3-4 of the Counties Code, 55 ILCS 5/1-1001, et seq. (“Illinois Law”); and
WHEREAS, Illinois Law sets forth the purpose of the public defender and the declaration of the General
Assembly of the State of Illinois wherein the General Assembly recognizes the People of the State of
Illinois’ fundamental right to quality legal representation in criminal and related proceedings; and
WHEREAS, Illinois Law also provides the process for appointment, the terms of employment, the oath
of office, the duties, the compensation, a provision for appointment of assistants, provisions for office
quarters and expenses and record keeping of the Public Defender in Cook County; and
WHEREAS, the President of the Cook County Board of Commissioners (the “President”) and the Cook
County Board of Commissioners clearly recognized the intent of the General Assembly to provide quality
legal representation to the indigent by seeking to reduce Edwin A. Burnette’s (hereinafter referred to as
the “Public Defender”) caseload by creating twenty-eight (28) new positions in the 2008 Budget; and
WHEREAS, notwithstanding the President’s and the Cook County Board of Commissioner’s willingness
to create twenty-eight (28) new positions to further ensure quality legal representation of the indigent,
during the Public Defender’s tenure, there were thirty-four (34) inmates of Cook County Jail (persons
held in custody who have not been convicted of a crime) who waited for trial for over five (5) years at an
approximate cost to the Cook County taxpayers of $5,584,500 ($90 per day for 34 inmates for 5 years),
while the Public Defender continues to fail to ensure that all assistant public defenders work a full forty
(40) hour work week, (See, Evaluation of the Juvenile Justice Division of the law office of the Cook
County Public Defender submitted herewith as Exhibit A on page 10 and hereinafter referred to as the
“Northwestern Report”); and
WHEREAS, Illinois Law provides the process for removing the Cook County Public Defender and is set
forth below:
The public defender once approved by the Board shall serve for 6 years and may be
removed by the President only for good cause or dereliction of duty after notice and a
hearing before the Board.
55 ILCS 5/3-4004.2(c) (emphasis added); and

6032

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 20, 2008
WHEREAS, Black’s Law Dictionary defines dereliction in the performance of duties as:
[W]illful or negligent failure to perform assigned duties; culpable inefficiency in performing
assigned duties.
West Group, Black’s Law Dictionary 454 (7th ed. 2001); and
WHEREAS, the President, being the duly elected officer, has determined that there is good cause to
remove the Public Defender; and
WHEREAS, the Public Defender has willfully or negligently failed to perform the following assigned
duties as the Cook County Public Defender in that:
1.

The Public Defender failed to notify the administration of the Chicago Community
Group’s ongoing report concerning the Criminal Courts; and the Public Defender, as
cited in the Northwestern Report, failed to ensure that all employees of his office
performed a full forty (40) hour week of work in exchange for their compensation;
specifically, the Northwestern Report stated there existed a problem in his office
concerning the early departure of assistants after court (See, Exhibit A, page 10); and

2.

The Public Defender has failed to timely process promotions of employees within his
office resulting in an unnecessary and unreasonable delay in the hiring of entry-level
employees. The following are examples of such failures:
•

On or about October 25, 2007, the Public Defender was provided with lists of
applicants for the promotional position of public defender III and IV. The Public
Defender has approximately fifteen (15) of these positions vacant. Filling these
positions would allow the Public Defender to create vacancies for public defender I
positions, and hire attorneys to reduce caseloads. As of March 31, 2008, the Public
Defender has failed to fill all such positions except three (3).

•

In or about July, 2007, the Public Defender requested that five (5) public defender I
positions be reclassified to clerical positions within his office, further reducing his
ability to hire attorneys to reduce caseloads. This request was processed on or about
July 17, 2007.

•

Beginning on or about November 29, 2007, the Public Defender was advised that
supervisory positions could not be posted until job descriptions for those positions
were completed by his office and reviewed by the Bureau of Human Resources.
Despite repeated communications, these descriptions were not completed until midMarch, 2008. At about that same time, the Public Defender requested that these
positions not be posted, thereby placing the entire process in indefinite limbo.

Such failures have led this Public Defender to have a caseload greater than the national
standard. (See, Exhibit B submitted herewith the American Council of Chief Defenders
Statement on Caseloads and Workloads, August 24, 2007); and
3.

The Public Defender failed to ensure that all non-union employees complied with the
President’s executive order concerning the five (5) furlough day mandate, which
contributed to additional financial burden to Cook County and such savings should have
been reprogrammed back into services to the poor; and
6033

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 20, 2008
4.

The Public Defender did not adequately handle the disciplinary issue of an employee
under his supervision who is alleged to have committed a crime in the workplace and
alleged to have been in possession of illegal and illicit drugs in the workplace; (See,
Exhibit C submitted herewith Pot Delivered to Public Defender’s Office Gets Clerk,
November 28, 2007); and

5.

The Public Defender has failed to identify Shakman Exempt positions as required under
the provisions of the Supplemental Relief Order and Consent Decree established in the 69
C 2145 and titled Shakman, et al. v. The Democratic Organization, et al.; and

6.

The Public Defender misled the Cook County Board of Commissioners by seeking the
appointment of a Special State’s Attorney to provide “analysis, interpretation and advice”
(See, Exhibit D submitted herewith Petition for Appointment of a Special State’s
Attorney) and the Public Defender exceeded such authority granted to him by this Board
of Commissioners by suing the President thereby causing a potential financial liability to

Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Committee on Criminal Justice of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County met pursuant to
notice for a public hearing on Wednesday, May 14, 2008 at the hour of 10:00 A.M. in the Board Room,
Room 569, County Building, 118 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois.
Your Committee has considered the following item and upon adoption of this report, the recommendation
is as follows:
293372

REQUESTING A MEETING OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE COMMITTEE TO
ADDRESS THE ISSUES AT THE JUVENILE TEMPORARY DETENTION
CENTER (PROPOSED RESOLUTION). Submitting a Proposed Resolution sponsored
by Joseph Mario Moreno, County Commissioner.
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, the Cook County Juvenile Temporary Detention Center (JTDC) has been
under duress going back several years; and
WHEREAS, on August 14, 2007, the court appointed Mr. Earl Dunlap as Transitional
Administrator for the JTDC in preparation for the transfer of the facility to the Office of
the Chief Judge; and
WHEREAS, in light of recent media reports and issues outlined in Mr. Dunlap’s most
recent update to the Board and that appear to hinder progress towards compliance with
the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA).

6100

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 20, 2008
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of
Commissioners does hereby request that a meeting of the Criminal Justice Committee be
scheduled as soon as possible to address the issues at the JTDC mentioned in the report
and in the interest of protecting the well-being of both the residents and the employees at
the center; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that Mr. Earl L. Dunlap, Chief Judge Timothy C.
Evans and Jonathan A. Rothstein appear before the Committee to address these concerns
and to collectively find ways to resolve them.
*Referred to the Committee on Criminal Justice on 04/09/08.
Earl W. Dunlap, Transitional Administrator for the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center (JTDC) thanked
Chairman Collins and the Honorable Timothy C. Evans, Chief Judge for appearing at the federal court
hearings in August. Chairman Collins and the Chief Judge Evans have been aggressive in stepping up at
the JTDC.
Mr. Dunlap stated he is committed to transparency which means there is nothing to hide at the JTDC.
The first report he submitted to the federal court dealt with the dysfunction at the JTDC. The first couple
of months focused on developing a table of organization and the 2008 budget submission.
Mr. Dunlap stated new procedures have been implemented which are important to the children. One is
the due process hearings for violating the rules. The JTDC established four staff positions to conduct due
process hearings and to investigate any wrong doings going on at the JTDC including physical and sexual
abuse of children. The due process hearing procedures were explained to the staff. Although some staff
members were on the defensive; many staff members responded in a positive way.
In 2008 there have been 50 internal investigations. A staff person was alleged to have physically abused
a resident and was placed in a non-contact situation. This staff member is removed from any kind of
direct and continuant supervision of children until the investigation is completed. The vast majority of
the investigations have come back as unsubstantiated, and no staff were immediately put back to work. In
those instances where they were substantiated, the appropriate disciplinary action was taken. The JTDC
had an enormous number of staff members placed on “non-contact,” “stop orders” and “remove from the
building” until the situations were resolved. This process has worked effectively. The staff have come to
understand throughout the JTDC that abusing the children will not be tolerated.
In 2007 the budget had 462 staff members and in 2008 the Cook County Board approved an increase to
567.
The JTDC has developed a 160 hour curriculum for all staff members, including new employees. The
JTDC has developed an 80 hour leadership training curriculum for middle managers and managers.
In January the JTDC will transfer intake screening, business and payroll functions over to the Chief
Judge’s Office to maximize resources and minimize unnecessary duplication.
Commissioner Moreno asked about the security firm Wackenhut. He inquired whether the firm has ever
been involved with juvenile detention facilities.

6101

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 20, 2008
Mr. Dunlap responded that Wackenhut’s reputation is not the greatest in the world. He stated that
problems have occurred in Florida, Louisiana, Michigan and several other states and jurisdictions related
to the juvenile population. He added that he has been an adversary of Wackenhut and is very familiar
with the firm. The firm is only allowed to be posted in the schools to provide security in halls and
corridors and to supervise on the night shift and handle night watch. The firm is not engaging with the
children. Wackenhut staff will receive 80 hours of training from the JTDC staff members and an
extensive background check is required of each Wackenhut staff member.
Vice Chairman Beavers inquired regarding the hiring practices at the Juvenile Temporary Detention
Center. He stated that the Bureau of Human Resource had posted 15 positions, and asked whether Mr.
Dunlap had hired staff.
Mr. Dunlap responded that he has hired no one.
Vice Chairman Beavers inquired about any interviews were conducted for any open positions at the
JTDC.
Mr. Dunlap responded over a hundred interviews have been conducted but that hiring is a very complex
process.
Vice Chairman Beavers requested that Mr. Dunlap refrain from blaming Cook County for the inability to
hire for open positions at the JTDC.
Mr. Dunlap agreed to quit engaging in such conversation.
Commissioner Quigley inquired about the overcrowding and reduction of population at the Juvenile
Temporary Detention Center.
Judge Evans responded that the State Legislature and Governor Blagojevich placed the Juvenile
Temporary Detention Center under his care approximately 180 days from the effective date of legislation
on January 1, 2008. He stated that technically the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center will be under his
care at the end of June. He believed that at the time the legislation was passed it was not assumed a
transition would take place during that time and after that time. The federal court has indicated the
Transitional Administrator has a right to do certain things. The phrase the federal court used is “to bring
the Cook County Juvenile Temporary Detention Center into substantial compliance with three items: (1)
the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA), (2) the Agreed Supplemental Order (ASO), and (3) the Modified
Implementation Plan (MIP).” Judge Evans assumed that once those have substantially been complied
with, the Transitional Administrator would be prepared to turn the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center
over to the Chief Judge’s Office.
The Chief Judge’s Office has regular meetings with the Transitional Administrator so that change occurs
even before that time elapses. The Transitional Administrator has turned over certain ancillary functions
to the Chief Judge’s Office in anticipation that the Chief Judge’s Office may carry out those functions
better. These include certain contractual functions providing food, procurement and MIS systems. In
addition, the Transitional Administrator is asking the Chief Judges’ Office to assist his office with
training and other aspects of testing. The Chief Judge’s Office should provide alternatives to detention
for many of the children who are housed in the detention center. The Chief Judge’s Office provides an
evening reporting system and that alternative has resulted in 93% of the children who go through the
evening reporting program never getting involved in delinquency activities again. The evening reporting
system described is recognized by the Congress of the United States. The Chief Judge’s Office would
like to get a substantial number of children who have not engaged in violent conduct out of the detention
center into other alternatives.

6102

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 20, 2008
Commissioner Daley asked if the alternative programs were increased whether there would be a decrease
in the population.
Judge Evans stated that he would like for the County of Cook to put a comparable amount of money in
the alternative programs that is put in the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center. He has asked the State
of Illinois for a fair share of funds for the alternative programs.
The Community Advisory Committee for the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center provided a
presentation to the Criminal Justice Committee. (The referenced documents are on file in the Office of
the County Clerk.)

Transition.

(a)
The County Board recognizes that there will be a necessary transition
period between the adoption of this Ordinance and the point at which the System Board
is capable of assuming all of its powers and responsibilities as set forth in this Ordinance.
The Office of the President shall cooperate with the System Board during this transition
to enable the System Board to assume fully its authority and responsibilities in as timely
a manner as practicable. Such cooperation shall include accommodating requests from
the System Board to provide adequate staffing at the CCHHS through the transfer or
reassignment of personnel to the CCHHS, including, but not limited to, personnel to
perform human resource and procurement/contracting functions.
(b)
In order to avoid unnecessary duplication of services, the System Board,
on behalf of the CCHHS, may, at its discretion, continue to utilize various ancillary
services provided through the Office of the President, including, but not limited to, those
services provided by the Office of Capital Planning and Policy, the Bureau of
Information Technology, the Department of Risk Management, the Department of
Facilities Management, the Department of Real Estate Management, the Office of the
Comptroller, and the Office of the County Auditor.
(c)
Any contracts entered into by the County on behalf of the Bureau of
Health prior to the adoption of this Ordinance shall remain in effect; provided, however,
that the System Board shall act in place of the County Board in any contract, bylaws or
agreement with the County which requires the approval or other action of the County
Board unless expressly prohibited otherwise in this Ordinance.
Sec. 38 792.

Severability.

Any provision of this Ordinance declared to be unconstitutional or otherwise
invalid shall not impair the remaining provisions of this Ordinance.
Sec. 38-8.

Termination of IBOD.

The Cook County Bureau of Health Directors and this Ordinance shall terminate
after three (3) years from the effective date of this Ordinance, unless the Cook County
Board of Commissioners acts to renew its powers and responsibilities.
Commissioner Suffredin explained the difference between his amendment and Vice Chairman Goslin’s
amendment which will follow. Commissioner Suffredin stated that in his amendment Chairman Butler as
the Chairman of the Health & Hospitals Committee was made an ex-officio member of the board without
a vote. He further explained that in Vice Chairman Goslin’s amendment Chairman Butler will be made
an ex-officio member with a vote and the Board will be increased to ten (10) independently appointed
individuals.
Commissioner Suffredin went through the ordinance and pointed out what information is included in the
Ordinance. He stated that the changes become significant because they came through negotiations with
the President’s Office and State’s Attorney’s Office looking at the Joint Commission on Accreditation of
Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) and all of the State and Federal regulations that are necessary to make
the independent Board work.

Termination of CCHHS.

The Cook County Health and Hospital System and this Ordinance shall
terminate after three (3) years from the effective date of this Ordinance, unless the
Cook County Board of Commissioners acts to renew its powers and responsibilities.
Chairman Butler asked Commissioner Claypool to read his amendment into the record.
Commissioner Claypool stated that he would walk through the individual changes within this amendment
because it is Commissioner Suffredin’s Ordinance with changes reflected by either double lines,
strikethroughs or double underline language restoring language that was in the previous ordinance
adopted by the Cook County Board coterminous with the budget.
Commissioner Claypool began with his first change on page two (2), Section 38-73(b): which eliminates
language referring to the Illinois General Assembly creating a special district to govern the Cook County
Facilities.
Commissioner Claypool continued with the next change on page five (5), Sections 38-76(b)(1)a.1.,
(b)(1)a.2. and (b)(1)b. shown by double strikethroughs, the language was changed from the original
ordinance to create five (5) year terms because of the permanence of the body as opposed to the original
terms that are coterminous with the three (3) year experiment.
Commissioner Claypool continued with the next change at the bottom of page 10 concluding at the top of
page 11, Section 38-82(d)(2): which reflects the fact that financial plans should be for three (3) years not
two (2) years, to make it consistent with the fact that it is a three (3) year Board not a permanent Board.

6131

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 20, 2008
Commissioner Claypool continued with the next change on page 15, Section 38-88(a)(3) striking out the
2 years and inserting year so that it’s consistent with the fact that it’s a short term institution.
Commissioner Claypool continued with the final change on page 17, Section 38-93: the last paragraph
which is being restored which was in the previous paragraph that was eliminated which is the sunset and
simply restore the language that was approved and put it back to what the Board originally approved
which is a three (3) year sunset.
Commissioner Claypool further stated that if the organization is successful, the Commissioners will rally
to re-approve it. In conclusion, he stated because of this being an experiment and there has been
problems with Independence Governance in the past, because there is no way of knowing if it will
succeed, he stated that it is prudent for the Board to retain control, not invite the Illinois General
Assembly and also to have a sunset that if it fails it will die a dignified death.
On the motion made by Commissioner Claypool, seconded by Commissioners Quigley and
Murphy, to approve the amendment to the Proposed Ordinance Amendment (Communication No.
293933), as amended. Commissioner Peraica called for a Roll Call, the vote of yeas and nays being

Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Committee on Legislation, Intergovernmental & Veterans Relations of the Board of Commissioners
of Cook County met pursuant to notice on Tuesday, May 13, 2008 at the hour of 10:00 A.M. in the Board
Room, Room 569, County Building, 118 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois.
Your Committee has considered the following item and upon adoption of this report, the recommendation
is as follows:
293931

CANDIDATES FOR THE INTERIM BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE COOK
COUNTY BUREAU OF HEALTH (APPOINTMENTS).
Transmitting a
Communication from Todd H. Stroger, President, Cook County Board of Commissioners,
dated May 2, 2008.
I would like to thank the members of the Nominating Committee for the work they have
done and most importantly for putting together a list of 20 excellent candidates. This has
been a difficult process, in that, all of the candidates offered have certain skills that make
them viable candidates to enhance this Independent Board. In putting together this list, I
have attempted to look at the following two key factors:

6154

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 20, 2008
(1)

I want a balanced board with diverse skill sets needed to address the
problems we face in a large complex public health network such as ours;
and

(2)

I want a board that reflects the cultural, gender and racial diversity of our
County.

Additionally, I attempted to the best of my abilities, to be certain that there were no
potential conflicts of interest in the members I have selected.
As stated above, I feel all of the candidates provided are excellent; thus, I will not address
any questions that relate to why I did not select a particular individual. Instead, I would
recommend to any person that wishes to offer someone else to consider, who they would
remove from the list I have put forth.
Before I give you the names I recommend, I call upon the Cook County Board of
Commissioners to improve the ordinance drafted on the night of the budget meeting
because such language fails to address critical issues such as Procurement, how Human
Resources will function as it relates to this new board and the County, what occurs when
there is a vacancy on the board or whether the Inspector General will have jurisdiction
over the new board.
Provided for below are my recommendations that I will offer to the Board of
Commissioners for their approval:

JOB

Karen S. Crawford, Director, President’s Office of Employment Training (P.O.E.T.), provided a
presentation to the Committee on Workforce, Job Development & Training Opportunities. (The
referenced document is on file in the Office of the County Clerk.)
Commissioner Sims voiced concern over the dropout rate in District #5.
Ms. Crawford stated the following: The youth funding stream comes in one lump sum. P.O.E.T.’s Office
provides funding to programs for in-school and out-of-school youth. The agencies are submitting
proposals to P.O.E.T. to be evaluated. P.O.E.T. evaluates how the in-school youth programs are in fact
affecting the dropout rate and the graduation rate. The out-of-school youth programs are run by the
schools. Most are run by community agencies which are responsible for identifying, finding and
recruiting people who have dropped out and re-engaging them so that they obtain their General
Equivalent Diploma (GED) and placing them into post-secondary training, college or the military. This is
how success is graded.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 20, 2008
Ms. Crawford continued to state re-engaging the youth on a day-to-day basis is what P.O.E.T. looks for
agencies to do in the One Stop Centers. The One Stop Centers welcomes youth to the programs without
qualification to go into training or college. The P.O.E.T. Office engages the youth to prepare for their
GED’s and other programs.
Chairman Collins inquired as to how the State Department of Labor obtains their information.
Ms. Crawford responded: Service providers enter information on the participants into the Illinois
Workforce Development Systems (IWDS). Participants are identified by their social security number.
Additional information related to the participants’ employment is pulled from Cook County P.O.E.T. and
the State of Illinois. Information is obtained from the providers and from the State of Illinois. The State
of Illinois reports to the Federal government.
Commissioner Sims, seconded by Commissioner Suffredin, moved to receive and file
Communication No. 293650. The motion carried unanimously.
Chairman Collins asked the Secretary to the Board to call upon the registered public speakers, in

outside contractors. Primary treatment resources are funded by the State of Illinois.
In 2002, the Circuit Court of Cook County received the initial grant award for the Community Circles
Project under the foundation’s Reclaiming Futures: Building Community Solution to Substance Abuse
and Delinquency. Originally limited to the Lawndale community, the Community Circles initiative has
since expanded to all communities in Chicago, providing substance abuse and mental health screening
and assessments for 100 percent of all diverted and adjudicated youth.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: None. Grant Award: $149,914.00. Funding period: April 1, 2008 through
