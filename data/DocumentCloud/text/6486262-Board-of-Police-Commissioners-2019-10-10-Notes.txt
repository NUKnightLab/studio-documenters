The​ Board of Police of Commissioners​ (BOPC) of the City of Detroit was created in 1974 by
City Charter, which was adopted by a vote of the people. The Charter vests broad supervisory
authority over the Police Department in the eleven-member civilian Board of Police
Commissioners.​ ​The BOPC meets every week. Meetings are held at Detroit Public Safety
Headquarters each Thursday at 3:00 pm except the second Thursday, when the community
meetings are held at 6:30 pm.
The Scene: ​The meeting was held at St. John Presbyterian Church 1961 Lafayette Blvd. The
Church located in the ​7th
​ Precinct of the Detroit Police Department and is celebrating its 100​th
Anniversary. The meeting took place in the David A. Harmon Fellowship Hall and appeared to
be large enough to accommodate the meeting. Chair Lisa Carter called the BOPC to order at
6:30 pm with 7 of the 11 Commissioners present. (​Commissioner Willie Burton District 5 arrived
at 7:07 pm). Approximately 70 people were in the audience at the start of the meeting. The

Comments

BOPC Officers Report:
-The Chair recognized injured and fallen officers and asked for an update from the Chief.
- Chair identified an area of ongoing concern with meetings being held at the Public Safety
Headquarters. Commissioner Burton, as well as members of the community have been asking
that the BOPC discontinue holding its meetings at the ​Detroit Public Safety Headquarters
because persons must show Id when entering the building. Commissioner Burton feels that
asking people to show Id is a violation of the ​Open Meetings Act​. In previous meetings the Chair
has pointed out that the BOPC does not require persons to show id but the building (Public
Safety HDQ) requires it. She stated that the BOPC is actively looking at other meeting locations
to resolve this issue.
Resolution Ms. Teresa McCormick
Ms. Teresa McCormick was presented with Resolutions recognizing her Community Service

The Chief’s Report was given by Deputy Chief Todd Bettison, he reported that crime in many
categories was down with a “slight uptick” 1 % in Homicides. There has been a significant
decrease in Car Jackings down 43% from last year. Commissioner Davis (7) asked, “Why has
there been such a decrease?” DC Bettison attributed the drop to an expansion of the ​Green
Light Program at Gas Stations, Citizens Radio Patrols and Community Groups such as ​Detroit
300​.
Human Resources Report: ​The Chair stated there would be no report from the Director due to
an injury.
7​th​ Precinct Report:
-​Captain Conway Petty reported that Motor Vehicle Theft was up 5%, Robberies up 2%,
Burglaries up 14%, Homicides down 18%, Violent Crime down 11%, Property Crime down 13%.
-Strategies to Reduce Crime: Increased use of technology, use data from Real Crime Center,
Apprehend individuals with Outstanding Warrants.
