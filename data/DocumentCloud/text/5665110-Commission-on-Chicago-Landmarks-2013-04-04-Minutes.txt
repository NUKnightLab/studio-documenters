Dijana Cuvalo presented the staff’s recommendation that the Commission preliminarily find that:
(a) pursuant to Article III, Section G.1. of the Rules and Regulations of the Commission on
Chicago Landmarks (the "Rules and Regulations"), that the significant historical or architectural
features are all exterior elevations and rooflines; (b) Preliminarily find that the subject building, a
2-story frame house constructed prior to 1886, contributes to the character of the Mid-North
District, which includes various building types and architectural styles that predominated during
the period when Chicago was rebuilding itself after the Great Fire of 1871; (c) Preliminarily find
that the demolition of a contributing building or structure within a landmark district is a per se

 adverse effect on the significant historical and architectural features, pursuant to Article III,
Section G.3.b., of the Rules and Regulations; (d) Pursuant to Section 2-120-780 of the
Landmarks Ordinance, preliminarily find that the demolition of the subject property will
adversely affect and destroy significant historical and architectural features of the property and
the district; and, (e) Issue a preliminary decision disapproving the demolition application.
Mrs. Cuvalo informed the Commission that a preliminary decision disapproving the demolition
application would trigger an informal conference and, if the informal conference did not reach an
accord, a public hearing on the permit application in accordance with the provisions of the
Chicago Landmarks Ordinance.
Matt Rich, Chief of Staff for Alderman Michele Smith, spoke on behalf of the Alderman in
support of preserving the building.
Nick Ftikas, attorney for the owners, stated that the owners had a conference with a
representative from the Alderman’s office and had come to an agreement that the application for
demolition would be withdrawn.
Because the permit application for demolition had not been formally withdrawn from the
Department of Buildings, the recommendation was made to defer the matter until the next
Commission meeting to allow the applicant formally withdraws the application for demolition.
Motioned by Leon, seconded by Wong and Blanchard. Approved unanimously. (7-0)
