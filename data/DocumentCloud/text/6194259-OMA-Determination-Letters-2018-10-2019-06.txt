OMA Request for Review —2014 PAC 28040

RE:
Dear

On February 18, 2014, you submitted a Request for Review to the Public Access

Bureau alleging violations of OMA by the Local School Council ( LSC) of Grimes/ Fleming
Elementary School. Your Request for Review requested that this office keep your Request for
Review confidential.

Section 3. 5(

a)

of

OMA ( 5 1LCS 120/ 3. 5(

a) (

West 2016))

requires a person

submitting a Request for Review sign the Request for Review. Section 3. 5( b) of OMA also
requires the Public Access Bureau to " forward a copy of the request for review to the public

body" within 7 business days of receiving the Request for Review. Because section 3. 5( a) of
OMA requires that the Request for Review be signed by you and because section 3. 5( b) requires
this office send a copy of the Request for Review to LSC, OMA does not permit you to remain
anonymous or this office to keep your Request for Review confidential.
On February 24, 2014,
an Assistant Attorney General in the Public Access Bureau left a voicemail message for you to
discuss your request that your Request for Review be kept confidential;

you did not respond.

Because there is. no indication that you are still interested in this matter, and because the

membership of the LSC is likely to be different at present, this file is closed. '

OMA Request for Review — 2014 PAC 30969

Dear Mr. Kraft and Ms. Rogers:

This determination letter is issued pursuant to section 3. 5( e) of the Open Meetings
Act ( OMA) ( 5 ILCS

120/ 3. 5(

e) (

West 2016)).

For the reasons explained

below, the Public •

Access Bureau concludes that the College of DuPage Board of Trustees ( Board) did not violate

the requirements of OMA in connection with its August 21, 2014, meeting.
On August 26, 2014, Mr. John Kraft submitted a Request for Review to the Public

Access Bureau alleging that the Board violated OMA in several ways at its August 21, 2014,
meeting. The

allegations

in Mr.

Kraft' s Request for Review largely concern the Board' s rules

governing

public

comment

and

the Board' s implementation

of

those

rules

at

the meeting.'

A

portion of Mr. Kraft' s Request for Review also alleges that an agenda item to approve a
resolution to censure a trustee violated OMA because it did not name the trustee, and because the

resolution read at the meeting contained additional items. In response to a request from this
office, the public body submitted a detailed answer to the allegations in the Request for Review,
as well as the relevant agenda and meeting minutes.

The Public Access Bureau has reviewed the materials submitted by Mr. Kraft and
the Board. As noted in the Board' s response, Mr. Kraft does not allege, nor is there any

indication, that he or any other member of the public was prohibited from addressing the Board
at the August 21, 2014, meeting. On the contrary, everyone present at the meeting who wished
to comment was permitted to do so. This office has consistently determined that it will not
undertake a review of a public bodies' rules or practices concerning public comment without an
allegation that the rules were applied in a manner that restricted a member of the public from

exercising his or her statutory right to address that public body. See, e.g., Ill. Att'y Gen. PAC
Req. Rev. Ltr. 50371, issued November 30, 2017, at 2.
Additionally, this office concludes that the agenda for the August 21, 2014,
meeting contained the essential details necessary to inform the public of the " general subject
matter" of the resolution to be addressed at that meeting, as required by the plain language of
section

2. 02(

c)

of

OMA ( 5 1LCS

Village of Campton

Hills, 389 I11.

120/ 2. 02( c) ( West 2016)); see also Foxfreld Subdivision

App.

v.

3d 989, 997 ( 2nd Dist. 2009) ( OMA does not require a

public body to provide a " specifically detailed" agenda; instead OMA " requires only that the
taken at a special meeting be germane to the agenda listed in the notice.").
Accordingly,
the Public Access Bureau concludes that Board did not violate the requirements of OMA in

action

connection with its August 21, 2014, meeting.

Mr. Kraft' s Request for Review also alleged that the Board violated OMA by beginning its

August 21, 2014, meeting at 7: 21 p. m. instead of 7: 00 p. m. as was listed on the agenda. This office has determined
that a similar allegation by Mr. Kraft in a separate Request for Review did not warrant further inquiry because it did
not set forth facts supporting an OMA violation, and we adopt that conclusion here. See 111. Att'y Gen. PAC Req.
Rev. Ltr. 38649, issued December. I6, 2015, at 2. Additionally, this office will not review Mr. Kraft' s allegation that

the Board improperly excluded a Board member from its closed session discussion because it does not set forth facts
supporting an OMA violation. See 111. Att' y Gen. PAC Req. Rev. Ltr. 35792, issued June 19, 2015 ( finding that
OMA

does

not govern who

may

or

may

not

attend a closed session.).

The Honorable Bernice Brewer

RE:

OMA Request for Review — 2018 PAC 55321

Dear Ms. Brewer:

This determination is issued pursuant to section 3. 5( b) of the Open Meetings Act
OMA) ( 5 1LCS 120/ 3. 5( b) ( West 2016)).

For the reasons set forth below, the Public Access

Bureau has determined that no further action is warranted in this matter.

On October 16, 2018, this office received your Request for Review stating that as
a

Trustee

on the

Village

of

Sauk Village Board

of

Trustees ( Board), you had requested

certain

items to be removed from the agendas of the Board' s September 11, 2018, September 25, 2018,
and October 9, 2018, meetings. You further stated that the mayor declined your requests, and
that the Board continued with consent votes on the items. You contended that the Board could

not group the items and take a consent vote unless all the trustees agreed to do so. Specifically,
you contended that the Board had to vote on the items separately if an objection was made to
taking a consent vote based on section 3. 1- 40- 40 of the Illinois Municipal Code ( Municipal
Code) ( 65 ILCS 5/ 3. 1- 40- 40 ( West 2016)).

The Public Access Counselor's authority to resolve disputes is limited to alleged
violations

of

OMA

and the

Freedom

of

Information

Act ( 5 ILCS 140/ 1

el

seq. ( West 2016)).

15

Therefore, your allegation that the Board has not complied with

a specific provision in the Municipal Code is not subject to review by this office. Unlike section
3. 1- 40- 40 of the Municipal Code, OMA does not govern when a board may take action by

consent vote. Rather, OMA concerns the transparency with which public bodies meet and
conduct business in relation to the public. Because your submission did not set forth a summary

RE:

OMA Request for Review —2016 PAC 41762

Dear

alleging

On May 4, 2016, this office received
Request for Review
City Council of Waukegan ( Council) violated the Open Meetings Act ( OMA) ( 5
seq. ( West 2016)) by failing to provide an adequate summary of two agenda items

that the

ILCS 120/ 1

et

in the minutes of its April 4, 2016, meeting. On May 25, 2016, this office forwarded a copy of
the Request for Review to the

Council

and asked it to provide a written response to that -

allegation.

On July 7, 2016, Mr. Stephen M. Martin, the City' s Corporation Counsel,
responded

on

behalf

of the

Council.

Mr. Martin' s response included an updated version of the

April 4, 2016, which provided additional details relating to the two agenda items at issue in
Request for Review. This office has reviewed the original and updated versions of

the April 4, 2016, minutes; the updated version appears to include " a summary of discussion on

all matters proposed, deliberated, or decided, and a record of any votes taken" in connection with
the disputed agenda items, as required by section 2. 06( a)( 3) of OMA ( 5 ILCS 120/2. 06( a)( 3)
West 2016)).
Because the Council has remedied the alleged violation by amending the April 4,
2016, meeting minutes to provide the requisite details, no further action by the Publie Access
Bureau is necessary.

This provision permits a person using reasonable diligence who discovers an alleged violation of

OMA after the initial 60 -day period has expired to submit a Request for Review within 60 days
of the date that the violation was discovered. The allegations in the above -referenced Requests
for Review concern meetings that occurred more than 60 days" before you filed your Requests for
Review. You have not, however, asserted that you discovered the alleged violations outside of

the initial 60 -day period or provided any information indicating that you did not discover them

within 60 days of theiroccurrence despite using reasonable diligence. Accordingly, this office
does not have authority to review the allegations.
Even if you did use reasonable diligence and submitted your Requests for Review

before the statutory period expired, you have not provided facts from which this office could
conclude that the Commission violated OMA. The intent of OMA is to " ensure that the actions

of public bodies be taken openly and that their deliberations be conducted openly" and to ensure

that individuals are " given advance notice of and the right to attend all meetings at which any

accordance with section 2. 02 above, OMA does not require the Commission to personally notify
its members or officials; that is a purely internal matter. Therefore, your claims that the

Commission did not personally notify you of its November 13, 2017, meeting or specify the
location of its -meetings on the meeting agendas do not provide facts supporting the allegation

No provision of OMA prohibits the Commission' s chair from

discussed financial matters in closed session is based solely on an agenda item. That allegation

OMA Requestfor Review — 2018 PAC 55408

RE:

Dear

The Public Access Bureau has received the above -captioned Request for Review,

in which you allege that the Sterling Municipal Band Commission ( Band Commission) violated
the Open Meetings Act (OMA) ( 5 ILCS 120/ 1

et.
seq. ( West 2016)).
After reviewing the
information that you have furnished, however, this office concludes that no further action is

warranted. •

On October 22, 2018, you submitted a Request for Review alleging that the
header of the Band Commission' s September 10, 2018, meeting agenda did not specify the •
location of the meeting. You also alleged that two people terminated during the meeting were
told they would be mailed evaluations and termination notices, but did not receive those
documents.

The intent of OMA is. to " ensure that the actions of public bodies be taken openly

This is a binding opinion issued pursuant to section 3. 5( e) of the Open Meetings

On June 13, 2014, the Public Access Bureau sent a copy of Ms. Hughes' Request

for Review to the Mayor and asked for a. written response to the allegations, a copy of the
Board's rules governing public comment, and the agenda and minutes of the April 14, 2014,

Board meeting. In addition, if the Board had adopted a rule requiring an individual wishing to

make a public comment at a Board meeting to publicly state his or her home address, the Public

Access Bureau requested that the Board explain its rationale for such a rule. In the absence of
such a rule, then.the Public Access Bureau asked for an explanation for requiring Ms. Hughes to
provide her home address at the April 14, 2014, meeting?
Counsel for the Village, Mr. Andrew S. Paine, responded in a letter dated June 30,

2014. Mr. Paine furnished copies of the agenda and minutes from the April 14, 2014, meeting
and a copy of the Village ordinance governing public comment at Board meetings. Mr. Paine

explained that the Board " has a long standing custom and practice of asking any member of the

public

the Board to provide his

or

her

address.

Mr. Paine also asserted that

although Ms. Hughes initially declined the Mayor' s request to state her home address for the

record at the April 14, 2014, meeting, Ms. Hughes " provided her address by her own volition and
not as a requirement to speak before the Board" and was " afforded the opportunity to address the

On

July 22, 2014, Ms. Hughes replied via e- mail and provided a video recording of the relevant
portion of the April 14, 2014, meeting as an attachment in mp4 format. Ms. Hughes stated that
Village Ordinance 0-84- 10 does not require a participant to provide a home address in order to
publicly address the Board. Ms. Hughes also asserted that " customs and practices" do not
constitute " rules" within the meaning of section 2. 06( g) of OMA. Finally, Ms. Hughes reiterated

that a person' s home address is private information, and claimed that she does not recall 'publicly

stating her address at prior public meetings. 8 The Board' s.attorney was copied on Ms. Hughes'
response.

ANALYSIS

This office has reviewed the video recording of the exchange among Ms. Hughes,
Mayor Reaves, and Mr. Stein during the April 14, 2014, Board meeting. The video shows
Mayor Reaves introducing the " audience participation" period by asking anyone who wished to
participate to approach the podium and state his or her name and address for the record. Mayor

Reaves also reminded the attendees to limit their comments to three minutes and to confine their
comments to new areas.

Ms. Hughes approached the podium, stated her name, and said that she was a
taxpayer from Lemont.

At that point, Mayor Reaves stated, " 1

Ms..

Hughes provided the name of her street and the nearest intersection to her home, and then began
her comments. The Mayor again stated that he needed her full address. Ms. Hughes attempted
to continue her comments without providing her address, but Mayor Reaves said " I have been

Mayor

Reeves then publicly sought the counsel of Mr. Stein. The audio portion of the off -camera

remarks of Mr. Stein is not entirely clear. However, Mr. Stein can be heard stating that a
person' s refusal to provide an address would not bar an individual from providing comment, but

that it is " helpful." r2 Mr. Stein also noted that if Ms. Hughes did not wish to provide her address,
the

Board

to speak and " take

i13

Following this exchange, Ms.

Hughes stated her home address and continued addressing the Board.
Prior to January 1, 2011, the OMA did not guarantee members of the public the
right

to address public

bodies.

instead, any right to do so was derived from statutes governing

specific governmental entities or policies adopted by them. Section 2. 06( g) of OMA, which was

added by Public Act 96- 1473, effective January 1, 2011, now requires that alt public bodies
subject to the Act provide an opportunity for members of the public to address public officials at
open meetings.

The right to address a public body is not without limits, however. To the
contrary, section 2. 06( g) expressly provides that public comment is subject to the " rules
established and recorded
by the public body." Although OMA does not specifically address the

types of rules that a public body may adopt, public bodies may generally promulgate reasonable
time, place and manner" regulations which are necessary to further a significant governmental

interest.
See, e.g,. I.A. Rana Enterprises, Inc. v. City ofAurora, 630 F. Supp. 2d 912, 922 ( N. D.
111. 2009) (
examining whether the application of city council' s rules for public comment violated

plaintiffs' rights). "

Timmon v.

For example, a public body may prescribe

time limits for public comment. See Wright v. Anthony, 733 F. 2d 575, 577 ( 8th Cir. 1984)

finding that a time limit for speakers at a public hearing served a significant governmental

interest in conserving time and in ensuring that others had an opportunity to speak, thus did not
violate the speaker' s first amendment rights).

The Village' s ordinance governing public comment provides:
Persons who wish to address the Board on any matter may
request recognition prior to the meeting, or during Audience
Participation, or if the matter relates to a specific agenda item,

during the discussion of that item. The President will attempt to

accommodate such requests to the extent practicable by directing
that such requests shall be heard during Audience Participation or

during debate on a specific agenda item. The President may in his
discretion set a time limit for each person' s address, taking into
account the number of persons wishing to be heard on a matter and
the amount of village business requiring attention. The President
or a majority of the Trustees present may extend the limitation of
time or grant additional time to individual speakers and the

President' s denial of or limitation on any request may be overruled
by a majority of the Trustees present. Provided, any failure to
adhere to the provisions of this section, and any such restriction or

limitation upon any speaker, shall not impair or affect any 14

ordinance, resolution, motion

action of the

Board.

The plain language of section 2. 06( g) of OMA provides that individuals are
entitled to address a public body subject only to a public body' s established and recorded rules.

Section 2. 06( g) does not recognize conditions on speaking arising out of "custom and practice,"
unless those conditions are incorporated into the public body' s rules. Here, the Board' s
established and recorded rules governing public comment do not include a requirement that an

individual publicly state his or her home address before speaking at public meetings. At the

April 14, 2014, meeting, however, the Mayor stated that those individuals wishing to speak
should approach the podium and give their names and addresses. Further, the video recording
shows that the Mayor specifically requested that Ms. Hughes state her address and repeated that
request when she attempted to begin her public comments without first providing her address.
The Mayor then asked the Village Attorney how to proceed, and he indicated that the Board
should allow Ms. Hughes to speak without providing her address. After the Attorney' s
comments, however, Ms. Hughes went ahead and stated her address, then provided her
comments.

While it is not clear that the Board would have continued to request her address

after the Village Attorney responded to the Mayor' s request for guidance, it does appear that the

requests for her address had the effect of making Ms. Hughes fee! that she needed to state her
complete home address before she could provide public comments.

Further, in its response to

this office the Board described asking for home addresses of speakers as a " longstanding custom
and

practice"

of

the Village, "

along with countless other public bodies." I7 Even if the Mayor had

allowed Ms. Hughes to address the Board without providing her complete home address in this
instance,

this

scenario

raises

an

important issue —

whether requiring, either by " custom and

practice" or by rule, that individuals provide home addresses before addressing a public body is
consistent with OMA. Because it appears that many public bodies have such a requirement,
clarification of the law in this area is warranted.

The Board notes that requiring individuals to state their addresses for the record
prior to providing public comment allows for more accurate meeting minutes, permits the Board

to determine whether the comments are raised by residents, and enables the Board to follow up
on issues raised by members of the public. While the rules governing public comment under
section 2. 06( g) of OMA may assist in accurate recordkeeping, their primary purpose is to
accommodate a speaker' s statutory right to address the public body while ensuring that order and

decorum are maintained at public meetings. See Rana Enterprises, Inc., 630 F. Supp. 2d at 92325.
It is understandable that a public body would seek to make sure. it is keeping accurate
minutes, hearing from residents and other interested parties, and responding effectively to
concerns raised at public meetings. Overall, in considering whether it is good policy to ask
members of the public to provide their addresses when making public comments, there are

reasonable arguments on both sides. Nothing prohibits a speaker from voluntarily providing his
or her home address in response to the public body' s request. However, the language of section
2. 06( g) does not support a requirement that a person must provide his or her complete home

address prior to being allowed to make a public comment. Section 2. 06( g) specifically provides
that " [ aJny

shall

be

permitted an

opportunity to

public officials[,]" ( emphasis

added) therefore a person' s right to comment at an open meeting is not contingent upon where he

or she resides. In this case, the Board violated section 2. 06( g) of OMA by placing a condition on
the making of a public comment that is not part of its established and recorded rules. But, even

if the. Board had established and recorded a rule requiring speakers to provide their home
addresses prior to speaking, we would conclude that such a rule would impermissibly exceed the
scope of the
rulemaking contemplated by section 2. 06( g). Requiring a member of the public to

provide his or her complete home address prior to speaking may have a chilling effect on

individuals who wish to speak at public meetings. Therefore, we conclude that requiring
speakers to state their home addresses prior to addressing public bodies violates
section 2. 06( g)
I8

of

OMA,

if

even

such

a rule

is

established

and recorded

body.

FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

After full examination and giving due consideration to the arguments of the
parties, the Public Access Counselor' s review, and the applicable law, the Attorney General finds
that:

1)

On April 14, 2014, Ms. Janet Hughes attended an open meeting of the Lemont

2)

On June 6, 2014, Ms. Hughes submitted a Request for Review to the Public

Village Board.

Access Counselor alleging that Village of Lemont officials " pressured" her to state her home
address for the record prior to being permitted to provide public comment at an open Board
meeting. Ms. Hughes' Request for Review was timely filed and otherwise complies with the
requirements

of section

3)

3. 5(

a)

of

OMA ( 5 1LCS 120/ 3. 5(

a) (

West 2012)).

The Attorney General properly extended the time to issue a binding opinion

by 21 business days, to September 4, 2014, pursuant to section 3. 5( e) of OMA. Therefore, the

Attorney General may properly issue a binding opinion with respect to Ms. Hughes' Request for
Review.

The Board and Ms. Hughes disagree whether she had given her home address prior to public

comment at previous meetings. Even if Ms. Hughes had previously stated her address at an open meeting in order to
be allowedofto speak, however, that disclosure would not waive her right to protest this practice or affect the
invalidity

such a

rule.

 Ms. Janet Hughes

The Honorable Brian K. Reaves
September 4, 2014
Page 8

4) Section 2. 06( g)

of

OMA

provides that "[

a] ny person shall be permitted an

opportunity to address public officials under the rules established and recorded by the public
body."
5)

Although the Board is authorized under section 2. 06(g) of OMA to establish

and record rules related to public comment, the Board did not establish or record a rule that a

speaker must provide a home address prior to providing public comment.

6) Prior to the audience participation portion of the April 14, 2014, meeting, the
Mayor directed that persons wishing to address the Board approach the podium and state their
name and address for the record.
7)

When Ms. Hughes attempted to address the Board without providing her exact

home address, she was asked three more times to state her complete home address.

8) The VillageAttorney advised the Mayor that Ms. Hughes should be allowed to
address the Board without providing her complete home address. Ms. Hughes, however, did
finally state her full home address before addressing the Board.

9) The Attorney General concludes that the Board violated section 2. 06( g) of
OMA when it stated that Ms. Hughes must provide her complete home address for the record

before addressing the Board, although this requirement was not an established and recorded rule.
Further, even if the Board had established and recorded such a rule, the rule would violate OMA

because it is not reasonably related to promoting meeting order or decorum; or ensuring that
other speakers have an opportunity to address the public body.

Therefore, it is the opinion of the Attorney General that the Lemont Village Board
violated the Open Meetings Act when it tried to require Ms. Hughes to state her home address

for the record prior to addressing the Board. In accordance with these findings of fact and

conclusions of law, the Board is directed to take appropriate action to comply with this opinion
by conducting its future meetings in full compliance with OMA.

This opinion shall be considered a final decision of an administrative agency for
the purposes of administrative review under the Administrative Review Law. 735 1LCS 5/ 3- 101

For the reasons set forth below, the information you

meetings held in August and September, 2018.

added.)

Your Request for Review speculates that the University may have discussed funding cuts during
the closed session portions of its August and September 201.8 meetings, but does not include a

summary of facts supporting that allegation. You noted that the Attorney General issued a
binding opinion concluding that the Board improperly discussed certain budgetary matters in
closed session during its June 28, 2018, meeting ( I11. Att'y Gen. Pub. Acc. Op. No. 18- 012,
issued October 2, 2018).

However, Tri States Public Radio reported the University' s decision to

eliminate its funding on August 17, 2018. 2 The agendas posted on the University' s website for
the

Board' s August

decision was announced

meetings indicate that those meetings were held on August

after the University's decision was already public. Because that

before the Board' s August and September

2018 meetings,

it cannot be

reasonably inferred that the Board subsequently discussed the funding .cuts during the closed
session portions of those meetings.

Because your Request for Review does not set forth a summary° facts supporting
the allegation that the Board violated OMA, and the Public Access Bureau has determined

that

no further action is warranted on this matter. This letter shall serve to close this matter. If you
have any questions, you may contact me at ( 312) 814- 6437 or the Chicago address listed on the

However, no provision of OMA requires a public body to include on a

Furthermore, it is undisputed that your letter was not read aloud or addressed by the Board at the
August 13, 2012, meeting. Therefore, regardless of whether your letter was addressed to the
Board President, the Board did not violate OMA by not including your letter on the agenda and

Starting with your allegation about recording the meeting, section 2. 05 of OMA
5 ILCS 120/ 2. 05 ( West 2016)) provides, in relevant part:

Subject to the provisions of Section 8- 701 of the Code of

Civil Procedure, any person may record the proceedings at
meetings required to be open by this Act by tape, film or other
means. The authority holding the meeting shall prescribe
reasonable

rules to govern the right to make such recordings.

Under this provision, members of the public may video record public meetings, subject to the
public body' s authority to implement reasonable rules governing the right to record. The
Attorney General has issued a binding opinion concluding that a public body may limit the
public' s right to record an open meeting only pursuant to rules that the public body has adopted,
and then only to the extent that those rules are designed to prevent disruptions or avoid safety
hazards

and

do

not

unduly

interfere

with

the

right

to record."

Ill. Att' y Gen. Pub. Acc. Op. No.

12- 010, issued June 5, 2012, at 4 ( concluding that a board rule that required *a person who wished
to record an open meeting to provide advance notice was unreasonable).

This office has reviewed the video recording pertaining to your first claim. The
recording reflects that you conveyed to the Council that you were recording the meeting. You
then had an exchange with certain members of the Council regarding your right to record the
meeting

until

a

Council

member

directed the discussion

to a

different

topic.

While certain

members of the Council initially objected to your recording of the meeting, the video recording
demonstrates that the Council subsequently permitted you to continue recording. Consequently,
your Request for Review does not allege facts sufficient to support the allegation that the

Council prohibited you from exercising your right to record an open meeting pursuant to section
2. 05 of OMA.

With regard to your second claim, section 2. 02( a) of OMA ( 5 ILCS 120/ 2. 02( a)
West 2016)) provides, in pertinent part:

An agenda for each regular meeting shall be posted at the principal
office of the public body and at the location where the meeting is
to be held at least 48 hours in advance of the holding of the
meeting. * * *
The requirement of a regular meeting agenda
shall not preclude the consideration of items not specifically set
forth in the

agenda. (

Emphasis added.)

specifically set forth in the agenda[ ]" in section 2. 02( a) to include " deliberations and discussion
but] not actions taken." Accordingly, a public body may properly discuss and deliberate on

subjects that do not appear on a regular meeting agenda, provided that no final action is taken on

those subjects. III. Att'y Gen. PAC Req. Rev. Ltr. 31408, issued June 20, 2016, at 2 ( concluding
that public body did not violate OMA by merely discussing topics that did not appear on the
agenda during a regular meeting).
Here, you alleged that the Council created an agenda item during the regular
meeting so that the Council Secretary, Michael Beyer, could respond to your public comments,
but you did not provide information indicating that the Council voted or otherwise took final
action on the added agenda item. Consequently, your Request for Review did not set forth facts
sufficient to support the allegation that the Council violated section 2. 02( a) of OMA.

West 2016))

With regard to the meeting minutes, section 2. 06( a) of OMA ( 5 ILCS 120/ 2. 06( a)
that "[ a] I1 public bodies shall keep written minutes of all their meetings,

provides

whether open or closed, and a verbatim record of all their closed meetings

recording."
in pertinent part:

A public body shall approve the minutes of its open
meeting within 30 days after that meeting or at the public body' s
second subsequent regular meeting, whichever is later. The
minutes of meetings open to the public shall be available for public

inspection within 10 days after the approval of such minutes by the
public body.
This office has reviewed the e- mail and attached minutes that a member of the

Council shared among Ogden International staff the day after the meeting in question. As you
highlighted,

the Council

had

yet to approve

the minutes.

While OMA requires that a public body

approve meeting minutes within a specific timeframe, and to make those minutes available to the

public within 10 days after their approval, it does not prohibit the internal circulation of any draft
minutes

among

a public

body' s

staff prior to their

final

approval.

Consequently, the claim that

the Council circulated unapproved minutes is insufficient to allege that the Council violated
OMA. Further, although you alleged that the unapproved minutes are inaccurate, that claim is

premature, as minutes are subject to change until they are approved by the public body.
Lastly, as to your claim that Mr. Ramos provided " inaccurate direction and legal
advice" to the

Council regarding the

RE:

OMA Request for Review — 2018 PAC 51413

and Mr. Boomer:

This determination is issued pursuant to section 3. 5( e) of the Open Meetings Act
OMA) ( 5 ILCS 120/ 3. 5(

e) (

West 2016)).

For the reasons explained below, the Public Access

Bureau concludes that the Pecatonica Township Board ( Board) violated the requirements of

OMA in connection with its December 19, 2017, meeting by prohibiting a member of the public
from addressing the Board during the public comment portion of the meeting pursuant to an
unreasonable

established

and recorded

rule.

On January 25, 2018,

submitted this Request for Review alleging

that that the Board did not allow him to provide public comment at its meeting on December 19,

2017. This office construed the Request for Review as alleging a violation of section 2. 06( g) of

OMA ( 5 ILCS 120/ 2. 06( g) ( West 2016)),

which

provides

that "[

a] ny person shall be permitted

an opportunity to address public officials under the rules established and recorded by the public
body." On February 6, 2018, this office sent a copy of the Request for Review to the Board and
requested a written response to
allegation, together with copies of Board' s rules

governing public comment and the December 19, 2017, meeting agenda and minutes. Having

the same information. On March 2, 2018, the Board' s attorney, Mr. John Nelson, informed this
office by telephone that
was told he could not provide public comment during the
Board' s December 19, 2017, meeting because he tried to sign up to speak 11 minutes before the
meeting began. On April 20, 2018, the Board provided a written response and copies of the

meeting agenda and minutes. On April 23, 2018, this office forwarded a copy of the Board' s
response to
he did not reply. On April 24, 2018, the Board provided a copy of the
ordinance setting forth its public comment rules.'
DETERMINATION

Under the plain language of section 2. 06( g) of OMA, a public body may restrict
public comment only pursuant to its established and recorded rules, which must tend to
accommodate,

than unreasonably restrict, the right to address public officials.

I11. Att'y
Gen. Pub. Acc. Op. No. 14- 012, issued September 30, 2014, at 6. Although OMA does not
specifically address the types of public comment rules that a public body may adopt, courts have
clarified that public bodies may promulgate reasonable " time, place, and manner" restrictions
rather

that are narrowly tailored to serve significant governmental interests. See I.A. Rana Enterprises,
Inc.

v.

City of Aurora,

630 F.

Supp.

2d 912, 922 ( N. D. I11. 2009).

For example, a public body

may adopt reasonable limitations on public comment in order to maintain decorum and ensure

that meetings are conducted efficiently. Timmon v. Wood, 633 F. Supp. 2d 453, 465 ( W. D.
Mich. 2008); see also 111. Att' y Gen. Pub. Acc. Op. No. 14- 009, issued September 4, 2014, at 4.

A rule that promotes order by requiring members of the public to sign up in
advance to address a public body does not violate the First Amendment to the United States
Constitution

it is

provided that

3 ( W. D. Mich. Jan. 30, 2009) (

E. D. Va. 2001) (
requiring speakers to sign up in advance of meeting is a reasonable content
neutral

regulation).

However, an advance sign up rule that is enforced to prevent a member of

the public from addressing a public body violates OMA if it is not reasonably necessary to
promote a significant governmental interest. 111. Att' y Gen. Pub. Acc. Op. No. 14- 012, at 6 ( rule
requiring members of the public to sign up to comment five days in advance of meetings, before
the board was required to post its agenda, imposed an unreasonable restriction on public
comment);

Compare with I11. Att'y Gen. PAC Req. Rev. Ltr. 39640, issued June 22, 2016, at 3 ( rule
requiring prospective commenters to sign up by start of meeting did not unreasonably restrict the
right to public comment).

In the Board' s response to this office, Trustee Brian Boomer stated:

According to the Pecatonica Township' s public speaking
ordinance, an individual that wishes to address the board has to

sign in to do so no later than 15 minutes prior to a meeting. In
order to ensure that there is no confusion as to our policy, and to
avoid possible complaints, we have been striving to be consistent
in its implementation.

the December 19, 2017 meeting after the deadline had passed, an
act to which I was personally a witness, and therefore was unable
to speak. The policy has been explained to
and he has

successfully signed in to speak at subsequent meetings?'

The Board also sent a copy of its ordinance requiring advance sign up for public comment,
which states, in relevant part:

Nonmembers may address the Pecatonica Township Board
if a written request is submitted to the Pecatonica Township
Board for the meeting the person requesting to speak at, no less
than fifteen ( 15) minutes prior to the start of the regular

meeting of the Pecatonica Township Board. 131
The Board also clarified that the vote to change the sign up deadline from 30 minutes to 15
minutes in advance of meetings was held on September 19, 2017, but that the ordinance is not

dated until March 20, 2018, because " a previous clerk had not filed a copy of the amended public
speaking ordinance.

Motion Carried.
Thus, the 15 minute advance sign up requirement was an established and
recorded Board rule at the time of its December 19, 2017, meeting. Accordingly, the Board did
follow its established and recorded rule when it prevented
from addressing the Board
i5

at that meeting.

This office concludes, however, that in the absence of a compelling government
interest, terminating sign- up for public comment 15 minutes before the start of Board meetings
unreasonably restricts public comment, and consequently such a rule violates OMA. The
Board' s response to this office did not explain why it considers a 15 minute advance sign up rule
necessary to ensure that its meetings are conducted efficiently or to maintain order. Further, it is
not clear how denying the opportunity to speak to people who arrive less than 15 minutes before

a meeting promotes any other significant government interest. To the contrary, requiring a
written request to address public officials and setting an arbitrary early cut- off time for signing
up potentially limits or reduces the number of people who are allowed to comment with no

concomitant benefit to the public body. The Board' s rules limit each member of the public to

three minutes of speaking time and allow a maximum of 30 minutes total for public comment. 6
Further limitation on public comment, including the advance sign- up requirement, seems
unnecessary to promote decorum or the smooth running of a meeting. This office requests that

the Board review and revise its ordinance regulating public comment accordingly.

posted at the Township' s principal office or at the location of the meeting at least 48 hours before
the meeting. With respect to your allegation that the Board' s agendas did not provide the

location of the meetings, the Public Access Bureau has previously determined that because OMA
requires a public body to post the agenda at the. principal office of the public body and at the
location of the meeting, a public body is not required to include the address of the location of the
meeting on the agenda. See I11. Att'y Gen. PAC Req. Rev. Ltr. 50231, issued October 30, 2017,

meeting agendas.

Next, you alleged that the Board violated OMA because it did not list the items

that you and the attorney requested to be added to the agenda for the October 23, 2018, meeting.

OMA Request for Review — 2018 PAC 54340

This determination letter is issued pursuant to section 3. 5( e) of the Open Meetings
Act ( OMA) ( 5 ILCS 120/ 3. 5(

e) (

West

2016)).

For the reasons that follow, the Public Access

Bureau concludes that the City Council ( City Council) of the City of Evanston ( City) did not
improperly restrict
from addressing its members during the public comment
portion of its July 23, 2018, meeting.
On August 5, 2018,

submitted a Request for Review to the Public

Access Bureau alleging that the City Council violated OMA during its July 23, 2018, meeting by
denying her time to speak during public comment. Specifically,
alleged that when
another member of the public attempted to cede her public comment time to her, the City

Council barred the commenter from doing so, despite the absence of a rule concerning the ceding
of speaking time to another. To establish that the City Council had no such rule at the time of its

July 23, 2018, meeting,

provided this office with a copy of the City Council' s

August 6, 2018, Rules Committee ( Committee) meeting agenda, which indicated that the
Committee would be considering whether to amend the City Council' s rules to prohibit the

governing public comment for this office' s review, together with a written response to

ability to address its members during the public comment portion of its July 23, 2018, meeting,
and, if so, whether it did so in accordance

with a reasonable,

August 23, 2018, the City Council provided this office with those materials and copies of the

arguing that it did not violate OMA. On August 28, 2018,

submitted a reply.

in barring

In its response to this office, the City Council argued that it did not violate OMA
from addressing its members during the public comment portion of its

July 23, 2018, meeting because its public comment rules require advance sign up by a
prospective

commenter.

replied by
alleging that the mayor pro tempore had prohibited her from addressing the City Council because
of the anticipated content of her comments, and had " selectively applied a ' rule' which she
created on the spot that evening only to [ her]. i4

The City Council' s argument relies on the following portion of its public comment
rules: "

Interested persons shall sign their name, address and the agenda item or other topic to be

addressed on a designated citizen participation sheet." 5 •

Although the requester alleged the lack of a rule concerning the ceding of time
and did not specifically challenge the reasonableness of the City Council' s sign- up rule, the
purpose of the Office of the Public Access Counselor is " to provide advice and education with
respect to the interpretation and implementation of the Freedom of Information Act and
OMA]."

6 This office notes that the Attorney General has issued a binding opinion concluding

that " the language of section 2. 06( g) does not support a requirement that a person must provide
his or her complete home address prior to being allowed to make a public comment."

This office' s review of the video recording of the July 23, 2018; City Council
meeting confirmed
claim that the City Council allowed another commenter to cede
his time, but this office' s review of the public comment sign -in sheet verified that the person to

whom the. commenter ceded his time had also signed up to address the City Council that evening.

Additionally, this office' s review confirmed the allegation in

reply that an

individual who had not signed up to address the City Council spoke on behalf of Mr. Cam Davis,
a candidate for the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District who had signed up to comment but
who appears not to have been in attendance at the meeting. However, the commenter merely
read a statement prepared by Mr. Davis. Thus, the City Council did not allow any commenter to
do what
attempted to do: address the City Council with her own remarks without
having signed up to do so.

provide: "

The maximum

If there are more than 15 speakers, the

Mayor will allocate time among the speakers to ensure that citizen comment does not exceed

forty- five ( 45) minutes."' The sign- up sheets provided by the City Council in its response show
over 80 signatures of persons wishing to address the City Council on July 23, 2018, so even with

limiting each speaker to one minute the City Council had more people signed up to speak than.
could fit within the usual time frame.

As to the argument that the Committee would not have had to consider whether to

amend the City Council' s' public comment rules during its August 6, 2018, meeting to prohibit
the ceding of time if the City Council already had a rule to that effect, it appears that the
Committee' s discussion during that meeting concerned the extent to which members of the public
who had signed up to comment could cede their time to other members of the public who had
also signed
up to comment.$
The City Council' s public comment rules provide a maximum of

three minutes per speaker;9 the Committee discussed that if 45 members of the public had signed
up to speak, causing each to be apportioned one minute, a person who had signed up to speak
could be ceded minutes from no more than two other people who had also signed up to speak,

bringing the recipient' s total speaking time up to the three minute limit. 10 Because the fact that
had not signed up to address the City Council at its July 23, 2018, meeting provided
a valid basis for the City Council to decline to permit her to participate in public comment on

that date, regardless of other considerations pertaining to ceding time, her argument that the
Committee' s August 6, 2018, discussion indicates that the City Council improperly restricted
public comment during the July 23, 2018, meeting is unavailing.
This office notes that it is significant that the City Council' s public comment rules

do not specify a time by which a prospective commenter must sign up to speak during a meeting,
and that there is no indication that the City Council cut off the time to sign up before the July 23,
2018, meeting started. An advance sign up rule that is enforced to prevent a member of the

public from addressing a public body violates OMA if it is not reasonably necessary to promote a
significant

governmental

interest.

Public Comment

The Board has not responded to this office' s written requests for copies of the

above- mentioned records together with a written response to the allegations in these Requests for
Review.

Section

3. 5( b)

of

OMA ( 5 ILCS

120/ 3. 5( b) ( West 2016)),

expressly requires the Board

to provide copies of the records for the Public Access Counselor' s confidential review and to
otherwise

cooperate

with

this office,'

Thus, by failing to respond to the Public Access Counselor

the Board has violated the requirements of OMA.

This office, however, has reviewed a video recording of a portion of the open

session of the June 12, 2018, meeting that was provided by

and

with their Requests for. Review. Although only members of the Board can be seen on
the video recording, the members of the public who addressed the Board, and attempted, to
address the Board, can be heard clearly on the audio of the recording. The audio of the public
comment portion demonstrates that the first member of the public who addressed the Board

asked questions concerning the procedures to rent certain areas in a park. The recording showed
that the Board permitted her to complete her comments then directed her to a particular form that

it indicated was in the meeting room to answer her questions. 3
The audio of the recording demonstrated that another member of the public then
was called upon to speak and was informed that she had three minutes to address the Board.
This individual began reading the Township Supervisor' s acceptance speech, then attempted to

cite concerns about the Township' s handling of FOIA requests and other perceived Township
and Board issues. During this portion of the public comment segment, however, members of the

Board continuously interrupted her by stating that her comments were inappropriate and directed
her to address the Board as a whole, which a member of the Board indicated was a part of its

rules governing public comment during meetings. The recording shows that while this
individual was still within the allotted three minutes to address the Board, the Supervisor used a
Section

3. 5( b) of FOIA provides: "

Within 7 working days after receipt of the request for review,

the public body shall provide copies of the records requested and shall otherwise fully cooperate with the Public
Access Counselor."

The Board should be mindful of its obligation to comply with this provision in the future.
Although the public has the right to address comments to a public body during open meetings,

public body members are under no obligation to respond to questions and comments during the meeting; public
comment is a time for citizens to be heard. See, e.g., 111. Att'y Gen. Req. Rev. Ltr. 37391, issued January 11, 2016
concluding that the public body' s practice of answering pre -submitted questions violated OMA because citizens
have a right to address the public body and public officials are not required to provide responses or answers during
public

comment).

 The Honorable JoAnn Quigley

gavel in an attempt to prohibit further speech and when the individual did not stop speaking, the
Board abruptly adjourned the meeting.
Although this individual made critical remarks concerning the Township
Supervisor, 4 it is not apparent from this office' s review of the video recording that those

comments disrupted the meeting. The recording shows that this individual was not attempting to
comment outside of the designated public comment period and did not act in a profane or

disorderly manner that interfered with the decorum of the meeting. Although this individual did
speak in a raised voice at times, it was only after the Board attempted to limit her speech. These
repeated interruptions unreasonably interfered with this individual' s statutory right to address
Board members. The audio of the recording also demonstrates that both before and after the
Board adjourned the meeting, at least one other member of the public stated that he wished to
address the Board, but he was not allowed to do so. Accordingly, this office concludes that the

Board improperly restricted these individuals from addressing the Board in violation of section
2. 06( g) of OMA.
Rules Governing Public Comment
The Requests for Review also alleged that the Board' s rules governing public
comment violate the requirements of OMA by improperly restricting a person' s right to address
individual Board

members.

The Board did not provide this office with a copy of its established

and recorded rules governing public comment during meetings. This office notes, however, that
it has previously determined that a public body improperly restricted an individual' s right to
public comment when the public body enforced a rule that required public comments to be
addressed to the board as a whole as opposed to individual board members. See 111. Att' y Gen.

PAC Req. Rev. Ltr. 50824, issued July 10, 2014, at 5- 6. In that matter, this office emphasized:
Even if [named person] had addressed an individual

that "[ a] ny

41t is also worth noting that this office has previously reviewed a public body' s decision to prohibit

rude or slanderous
remarks."
111. An' y Gen. PAC Req. Rev. Ltr. 39069, issued April 5, 2016, at 3. In that matter,
this office emphasized: "[

necessarily dependent upon the listener' s personal perspective. When criticism involves the conduct of present or

duties,

latitude

must

be allowed."

111. Att' y Gen.

PAC Req. Rev. Ltr. 39069, at 3. Because the speaker' s attempt to comment at the meeting did not appear to create a
disturbance or interfere with the efficiency of the proceedings, this office concluded that the public body improperly

his comments. 111. Att' y Gen.

person shall be permitted an opportunity to address public officials
under the rules established and recorded by the public body."
Emphasis added.)
Although a public body may establish
reasonable " time, place, and manner"

rules to maintain

order and

decorum, it is unclear that prohibiting members of the public from
addressing specific public officials at a meeting is necessary to
maintain order and decorum.

Likewise, here the recording shows a member of the Board indicating that its
rules prohibit members of the public from addressing individual public officials at a meeting.
The Board has provided no support to demonstrate why this rule is necessary to promote order
and decorum atmeetings, or to further any other significant governmental interest. Accordingly,
this office requests that the Board permit members of the public to address individual Board
members at future meetings. To the extent that the Board has established and recorded rules

governing public comment, we suggest that it revise its public comment rules to remove any
such

prohibition.

The Public Access Counselor has determined that resolution of these matters does

not require the issuance of a binding opinion. This letter serves to close these matters.

As an initial matter, the Public Access Counselor' s authority to resolve disputes is

limited to alleged violations of OMA and the Freedom of Information Act ( 5 ILCS 140/ 1 el seq.
West 2016)).

See 15 ILCS 205/ 7(

c)(

3) ( West 2016).

Therefore, allegations concerning

improper bidding practices for public works projects are not subject to review by this office.
Section 2. 02(

a)

of

OMA ( 5 ILCS 120/ 2. 02(

a) (

West

2016))

generally

requires a

public body to post an agenda at least 48 hours in advance of a special meeting. Section 2. 02( c)
of

OMA ( 5 ILCS 120/ 2. 02(

c) (

West 2016)) additionally

in

provides,

relevant

part: "

Any agenda

required under this Section shall set forth the general subject matter of any resolution or
ordinance that will

be

the subject

of

final

action

at the

meeting."

The Senate debate on House

Bill No. 4687, which, as Public Act 97- 827, effective January 1, 2013, added section 2. 02( c) of
OMA, indicates that the General Assembly intended this provision to ensure that agendas

provide sufficiently descriptive advance notice of the matters upon which a public body
anticipates taking final action:
T] here was just no real requirement as to how specific [ public

bodies] needed to be to the public of what they were going to
discuss that would be final action. And this just says that you have
to have a * * *
general notice, if you' re going to have and take final
action,

as

to

generally

what' s

going

to

be discussed

so

that —

that

people who follow their units of local government know what

they' re going to be acting upon. Remarks of Sen. Dillard, May 16,
2012, Senate Debate on House Bill No. 4687, at 47.

The Public Access Bureau has preyiously determined that " the General Assembly's use of the
term ' general subject matter' signifies that a meeting agenda must set forth the main element( s),

rather than the specific details, of an item on which the public body intends to take final action."
111. Att' y Gen. PAC Req. Rev. Ltr. 45667, issued February 16, 2017, at 4- 5.

In this instance, the agenda item " Action re: Construction of New Workshop" .

gave notice that the Board was contemplating taking a vote in open session on the building of a
new workshop. Although the agenda did not state that the Board was pursuing financing at a
local bank or hiring a local contractor to perform the work, those appear to be specific details of
the construction project, rather than the broader " general subject matter" that the Board was
required to set out on the agenda.

Furthermore, the language " considering building a new

workshop" adequately conveyed that the Board might vote that evening to move forward with

the construction. Because your Request for Review does not provide a summary of facts

RE:

OMA Request for Review — 2012 PAC 21622

Dear Mr. Charleston and Ms. Hodges:

This determination letter is issued pursuant to section 3. 5( e) of the Open Meetings
Act ( OMA) ( 5 ILCS 120/ 3. 5(

e) (

West 2016)).

For the reasons that follow, the Public Access

Bureau concludes that the Westmont Community Unit School District No. 201 ( District) Board

of Education ( Board) held an improper closed session discussion during its August 21, 2012,
meeting.

On September 27, 2012, this office received Mr. Daniel L. Charleston' s Request

for Review alleging that the Board improperly discussed matters concerning a retiree and
strategy related to staffing a position. On October 10, 2012, this office sent the Board a copy of Mr. Charleston' s Request for Review and asked it to respond to the' allegations that the Board

violated

OMA.

On October 24, 2012, counsel for the Board provided this office with a written

answer and copies of the open and. closed session minutes of the August 21, 2012, meeting. On

October 26, 2012, this office sent Mr. Charleston a copy of the Board's answer; he did not reply.

In its response to this office, the Board stated that it went into closed session
under section 2( c)( 1) of OMA to discuss health insurance benefits for a retiree, the retirement of

a particular employee in the business office, and the resulting vacancy. The Board asserted that
the discussion of the retiree was permitted because the definition of "employee" in section 2( d)
of OMA ( 5 ILCS 120/ 2( d) ( West 2010)) is not limited to current employees. The Board' s
response to this office explained that the closed session discussion " concerned a dispute with a

employee pursuant to an employment agreement that originated in an employer- employee

deviated in its discussions of the particular retiring employee to the position in general and the
compensation for the position. Although discussions concerning the specific retiring employee

pursuant to section
a) (

West 2016))

3. 5(

a)

of

the

Open Meetings Act ( OMA) ( 5 ILCS

alleging that the Winnebago County Housing Authority Board ( Board)

violated OMA by failing to post meeting minutes on its website. Specifically,
alleged that the Board had not posted minutes of any meetings that were held after January 19,

2017. On October 22, 2018, this office forwarded a copy of the Request for Review to the Board
and asked the Board to provide a written response addressing the allegations, and to clarify
whether the individuals who maintain the Housing Authority' s website are its full- time staff

members. On October 30, 2018, the Board' s executive director responded that all meeting
minutes were now available on the Board' s website and identified the individual who maintains

the website. On October 31, 2018, this office forwarded a copy of the Board' s response to

meeting,

is later."

Section 2. 06( b) of OMA further provides:

a public body that has a website that the full-time staff of the
public body maintains shall post the minutes of a regular meeting

of its governing body open to the public on the public body's
website within 10 days after the approval of the minutes by the

public body. Beginning July 1, 2006, any minutes of meetings
open to the public posted on the public body's website shall remain
posted on the website for at least 60 days after their initial posting. ,
The Board is the Housing Authority' s governing body and the Board' s response to

this office not dispute that the Housing Authority' s website is maintained by a full- time staff
member. Therefore,. section 2. 06( b) requires the Board to post minutes of its meetings on the

Housing Authority' s website. Based on this office' s review of the website, meeting minutes are
now posted through September 19, 2018. Because the Board has not yet held its November 2018

meeting, there is no indication that the Board has approved minutes of its October 2018 meeting.
Byposting the requisite meeting minutes on its website in accordance with section 2. 06( b) of
OMA, the Board has resolved the underlying allegation in this matter.
Accordingly, this letter shall serve to close this matter. If you have anyquestions,

5 ILCS 120/ 1 ( West 2016).

Section 2( a) of OMA

The Board' s response to the Request for Review

argues that it was " justified in discussing the issue of liability insurance outside the hearing of
the general public because it was inevitable that a pending lawsuit involving the termination of a

county employee [ redacted] would be part of the discussion." 2 Although the Board' s response
does not specifically identify any exception listed in section 2( c) that it believes permitted that
discussion, this office construes the Board' s response as arguing that its closed session discussion
2( c)( 11) of OMA ( 5 ILCS 120/ 2( c)( 11) ( West 2012)).
of insurance
was authorized by section
That exception allows a public body to close its meeting to discuss:
Litigation, when an action against, affecting or on behalf of

Based on the assertions made in the response to the Request for Review, along
with this office' s confidential review of the minutes from the November 14, 2013, closed session,

the Board' s discussion at the closed meeting concerned the terms of a potential new liability
insurance policy. Although the pending lawsuit cited in the Board' s response was also
mentioned, the closed session discussion did not stay within the scope of the strategies, posture,

theories, and consequences of that litigation. Accordingly, this office concludes that the Board
violated section 2( a) of OMA by discussing the issue of liability insurance in closed session
during its November 14, 2013 meeting.

Request for Review

section

2. 06( b)

public body' s website shall remain posted on the website for at
least 60 days after their initial posting.

On January 22, 2014, this office forwarded a copy of the Request for Review to
the District and asked it to respond to
allegation. On February 6, 2014, the District
responded that it had approved the minutes of its October 16, 2013, November 20, 2013, and
November 26, 2013, meetings on November 20, 2013, and December 18, 2013, but had not
posted them on

its

website until

December 23, 2013,

and

December 30, 2013.

Thus, the District

acknowledged that it posted the minutes past the 10 day deadline specified in section 2. 06( b) of
OMA. The District also explained that the minutes were not posted on its website due to an
unintentional clerical error.

Because it is undisputed that the District failed to post the minutes of its October
16, 2013, November 20, 2013, and November 26, 2013, meetings within 10 days after approval,
this office concludes that the Board did not meet the requirements of section 2. 06( b) in this

instance. No further corrective action is required because the Board remedied the violation by

For the reasons explained below, the Public Access

Bureau concludes that the City Council ( City Council) of the City of Geneseo ( City) violated the
requirements of OMA in connection with its April 22, 2014, special meeting.

On May 16, 2014,
submitted a Request for Review to the
Public Access Bureau alleging that the City Council held a special meeting on April 22, 2014,
that violated the requirements of OMA. Specifically,
asserted that the City
Council failed to post an agenda at least 48 hours in advance of the special meeting, and alleged •

that several members of the City Council met prior to the special meeting to discuss the need to
hire outside legal representation to represent the City Council at the special meeting. In response
toa request from this office, the public body submitted a detailed answer to the allegations in the
Request for Review.

Therefore, this office concludes that the City

Council violated OMA by failing to provide the public with at least 48 hours advance notice of
its April 22, 2014, special meeting.

Additionally, the City Council' s response confirmed that three City Council
members met outside of an open meeting to discuss the hiring of outside counsel. The City
Council is comprised of eight City Council members and the mayor. Therefore, a quorum is
comprised of five members, and a majority of the quorum is four members. Although
contends that at least five council members appear to have taken part in the private

meeting, the City Council has stated that there is no indication that more than three council
were involved.
members
In light of these conflicting versions, there is insufficient evidence
from which this office could conclude that the gathering of some council members prior to the

City Council' s April 22, 2014, special meeting constituted a meeting of the City Council subject
to the requirements of OMA.
The Public Access Counselor has determined that resolution of this matter does

not require the issuance of a binding opinion. If you have any questions, you may contact me at

2018 PAC 53945

Dear Ms. Dunn and Mr. Williams:
This determination is issued pursuant to section 3. 5( e) of the Open Meetings Act

For the reasons that follow, the Public Access Bureau

OMA) ( 5 ILCS 120/ 3. 5(

is unable to conclude from the available information that the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. College
Preparatory High School ( School) Local School Council (Council) violated OMA in connection
with meetings that it held in April and May 2018.
BACKGROUND

On June 8, 2018, Ms. Natasha Dunn submitted a Request for Review (2018 PAC

53511) to the Public Access Bureau alleging that between September 2017 and May 2018 the
Council did not follow the protocol required by OMA in connection with its process to choose a
principal

for

the School.

Specifically, Ms. Dunn alleged that the Council violated OMA during

its ( 1) December 14, 2017, meeting, by improperly going into closed session to discuss the

session; and ( 5) May 7, 2018, special meeting by taking action regarding the selection of a
principal in closed session, not informing the public of that action, and not allowing members of
the public to address the Council.'

On June 27, 2018, this office forwarded a copy of Ms. Dunn's Request for Review
to the Council and asked it to provide a detailed written response to the allegations regarding the
May 7, 2018, meeting. On July 2, 2018, Mr. Kwesi Kuntu Sr., Chairperson of the Council,
responded on behalf of the Council, and included links to audio recordings. The Public Access

Bureau was only able to open one of the links, which was a recording of the open session of its
2
May 7, 2018, meeting prior to entering closed session. On July 13, 2018, this office forwarded
a copy of the Council' s response to Ms. Dunn; on July 17, 2018, Ms. Dunn replied.
On July 9, 2018, Ms. Dunn submitted an additional Request for Review ( 2018
PAC 53945) to the Public Access Bureau alleging that the Council violated OMA in connection
with its May 12, 2018, special meeting by ( 1) voting to extend a contract to Ms. Melanie Sevier
as the new principal of the School; ( 2) holding the meeting in an outdoor location which was not
open

and convenient

to the

public; (

3) posting on the School door an agenda for its May 12,

2018, meeting which contained the wrong date of the meeting; and ( 4) failing to discuss each

item on its agenda. As part of her Request for Review, Ms. Dunn attached a copy of the agenda
and minutes of the Council' s May 12, 2018, special meeting. On July 27, 2018, this office
forwarded a copy of Ms. Dunn' s Request for Review to the Council and asked it to provide a

detailed written response to the allegations raised by her Request for Review. On August 7,
2018, Mr. Jonathan Williams, the new Chairperson of the Council, responded on behalf of the

Council. On August 24, 2018, this office forwarded a copy of the Council' s response to Ms.
Dunn; she did not reply. This office has consolidated these files for purposes of this
determination because they involve the same parties and interrelated issues.

As part of her Request for Review, Ms. Dunn attached copies of the Council' s agendas for the

following meetings: December 13, 2017, January 4, 2018, March 5, 2018, April 11, 2018, April 27, 2018, May 7,
2018; and copies of the Council' s minutes for the following meetings: December 13, 2017, January 4, 2018, March
4, 2018, April 11, 2018, April 27, 2018, April 30, 2018, and May 7, 2018.

2Mr. Kuntu informed this office that he would place the remainder of the recordings on a disc and
send

them to this office.

To date, this office has not received a
copy of those

recordings.

DETERMINATION

As an initial matter, we note that section 3. 5( b) of OMA ( 5 ILCS 120/ 3. 5( b)
West 2016))

directs this office to " forward a copy of the request for review to the public body,"
c) ( 5 ILCS
120/ 3. 5( c) ( West 2016)) permits the public body to " answer the
allegations
in the request for Review." During the principal candidate selection. process Mr.
Kuntu was Chairperson of the Council. On June 27, 2018, this office forwarded a copy of Ms.
and

section

3. 5(

Dunn' s Request for Review, 2018 PAC 53511, to the Council and asked it to provide a detailed

written response to certain allegations. On July 2, 2018, Mr. Kuntu provided a response;
however, his term as Chairperson expired on June 30, 2018. On July 1, 2018, Mr. Jonathan
Williams became Chairperson of the Council and Ms. Dunn became a member of the Council.
Mr. Williams helped Ms. Dunn draft her Request for Review 2018 PAC 53945, which was

submitted to this office on July 9, 2018. Because the membership of the Council has changed
and the former members cannot be compelled to respond to the allegations, this office' s ability to
obtain pertinent information about the allegations is limited.

This office also notes that the Public Access Counselor' s authority to resolve
disputes is limited to alleged violations of OMA and the Freedom of Information Act ( 5 ! LCS
140/ 1

et

seq. ( West 2016)).

See 15 ILCS 205/ 7( c)( 3) ( West 2016).

Accordingly, to the extent

that Ms. Dunn' s Requests for Review alleged that the Board violated other laws, those

allegations are not subject to review by this office.

if facts

the discovery of the alleged violation. The request for review must
be in writing, must be signed by the requester, and must include a

of the

the allegation. (

The Request for Review ( 2018 PAC 54511) that Ms. Dunn submitted to this

office on June 8, 2018, alleges that the Council violated OMA during its December 14, 2017, and
January 4, 2018, meetings. Ms. Dunn submitted her Request for Review more than 60 days after
the date of those alleged violations, and has not asserted or provided any facts indicating that she
did not discover the alleged violation before the 60 -day period expired despite utilizing
reasonable
diligence.
Because Ms. Dunn submitted her Request for Review after the statutory
period for doing so elapsed, section 3. 5( a) of OMA precludes this office from reviewing the
allegations regarding the December 14, 2017, and January 4, 2018, meetings.

Here, Ms. Dunn alleged that during the closed session portion of its April 27,
2018, meeting the Council voted to narrow the field of principal candidates to three specific
candidates. That vote did not, however, resolve the matter. Instead, it was merely a step towards
taking final action to select a principal. Because narrowing the field to three candidates was not

In addition, Ms. Dunn alleged that the Council violated OMA during the May 7,
2018, meeting by taking action regarding the selection of a principal in closed session. The

Council Chairperson at the time of the meeting, Mr. Kuntu, stated that no action was taken on
May 7, 2018, regarding the selection of the principal because the closed session and subsequent

attempt to reconvene in open session was disrupted by members of the public. Ms. Dunn stated
that the closed session took place for over an hour and alleged that during that time the Council
voted to extend a contract.

Under the plain language of section 2( e) of the Open Meetings

Act, the public

vote is not merely a ratification of a final action taken earlier in a closed session; it is the final

Even assuming the Council reached a consensus on the
principal candidate during the May 7, 2018, closed session, the parties agree that the Council
voted to hire a new principal
during a meeting held on May 12, 2018. Accordingly, any vote by

final action on hiring a principal took place at a subsequent meeting. Because this

matter -

final action occurred on May 12, 2018, this office cannot conclude that the Council violated
5
section 2( e) of OMA
during its May 7, 2018, meeting.
Ms. Dunn' s Request for Review also alleged that the Council improperly met in secret regarding
particularmatters pertaining to the principal selection process, including the posting of advertisements for principal
candidates, the scheduling of principal interviews, the scheduling of the candidate forum, and as evidence provides a
copy of the Council' s April 11, 2018, meeting minutes, which does not list "these items. Section 3. 5( a) of OMA ( 5

allegation."

Ms. Dunn did not provide a summary of facts which support the allegation of a secret meeting,

especially where the March 4, 2018, special meeting minutes she provided to this office show that the Council voted
regarding principal advertisement, and the minutes of the April 27, 2018, special meeting she provided evince a

discussion regarding the scheduling of candidate interviews for April 21, 2018, the candidate forum for May 2,
2018, and the final decision for May 7, 2018. Therefore, this office determined that no further action was warranted

Ms. Dunn alleged that during its May 7, 2018, special meeting, the Council did
not allow members of the public to address its members.

The agenda listed the public comment

portion as the last item on the agenda before adjournment. The Council Chairperson at the time

of the meeting, Mr. Kuntu, stated that the agenda listed public comment at the end of the May 7,
2018, meeting, but before that time both the closed session of the meeting and subsequent open

session were disrupted by members of the public and chaos ensued. Consequently, Mr. Kuntu
stated, he adjourned the meeting for safety reasons. Mr. Kuntu also stated that due to the chaos,
some of its members left the meeting and, therefore, he adjourned the meeting because a quorum

was no longer physically present. In her reply, Ms. Dunn disputed this account, stating that only
one member left the meeting early, that Mr. Kuntu cut off a member of the public from speaking,
and that he unilaterally adjourned the meeting. The recording of the open session portion of the
May 7, 2018, special meeting shows that as soon as the Council passed a motion to go into
closed session,6 a group of people began shouting after apparently being prompted by a member
of

the public.

The tape cut off at that point and this office has no further recordings.

While it is undisputed that the Council adjourned the meeting prior to the public
comment portion of the meeting, Mr. Kuntu asserts that it was necessary to ensure safety because
disruption.

Where a public body has reasonable grounds to believe that continuing a
meeting could have posed a risk to public safety, it does not violate OMA by adjourning the
meeting prior to public comment. See Ill. Att' y Gen. PAC Req. Rev. Ltr. 49736, issued February
6, 2018, at 11.
In light of the parties' conflicting versions, and because the only recording of the

inclement weather. This office has not been provided any facts to suggest that the Council
prohibited persons from attending; therefore, the meeting was an open meeting. Our

determination regarding the meeting' s convenience hinges on whether the May 12, 2018, special
meeting was reasonably accessible, taking into consideration the circumstances present at that
time. While it seems unusual to hold a meeting outdoors on a Saturday night in the weather
conditions described in the Request for Review, this office has not been provided any facts from
which we could conclude that people were deterred from attending. Rather, Mr. Williams
informed this office that 75 people attended the meeting and that various parent and student
groups provided rides to participants. Given the size of the attendance at the meeting and lack of
facts corroborating the allegation that the weather discouraged additional members of the public

from attending, this office is unable to conclude that the meeting was not reasonably accessible.

in which you allege that Sterling Municipal Band Commission ( Commission) violated the Open
Meetings Act ( OMA) ( 5 ILCS 120/ 1

et.

seq. ( West 2016)).

After reviewing the information that

you have furnished, however, this office concludes that no further action is warranted.

On October 22, 2018, you submitted the following Requests for Review alleging:
1)

2018 PAC 55393 — the agenda for the December

11, 2017, Commission

meeting was not on a Commission letterhead and did not identify the location
of the meeting in the header, or the time and location of the meeting at the
bottom; the chair of the Commission used a school fax machine to send the

minutes to the Sterling city clerk;
2)

3)

2018 PAC 55394 —

A person who believes that a violation of,this Act by a
public body has occurred may file a request for review with the

Public Access Counselor established in the Office of the Attorney
General not later than 60 days after the alleged violation. If facts

concerning the violation are not discovered within the 60 -day

period, but are discovered at a later date, not exceeding 2 years
after the alleged violation, by a person utilizing reasonable

diligence, the request for review may be made within 60 days of
the discovery of the alleged violation. The request for review must

be in writing, must be signed by the requester, and must include a
summary

of

the facts

supporting

the allegation. ( Emphasis

added.)

This provision permits a person using reasonable diligence who discovers an alleged violation of
OMA after the initial 60 -day period has expired to submit a Request for Review within 60 days

of the date that the violation was discovered. The allegations in the above -referenced Requests
for Review concern meetings that occurred more than 60 days before. you filed your Requests for
Review. You have not, however, asserted that you discovered the alleged violations outside of

the initial 60 -day period or provided any information indicating that you did not discover them
within 60 days of their occurrence despite using reasonable diligence. Accordingly, this office
does not have authority to review the allegations.

Even if you did use reasonable diligence and submitted your Requests for Review

before the statutory period expired, you have not provided facts from which this office could
conclude that the Commission violated OMA. The intent of OMA is to " ensure that the actions

of public bodies be taken openly and that their deliberations be conducted openly" and to ensure

that
individuals are " givenisadvance notice of and the right to attend all meetings at which any
business

This determination is issued pursuant to section 3. 5( e) of the Open Meetings Act
OMA) ( 5 ILCS 120/ 3. 5(

e) (

West 2016)).

For the reasons that follow, the Public Access Bureau

concludes that the Board of Education ( Board) of Taylorville Community Unit School District
3 violated OMA by failing to provide advance notice of the general subject matter of a final
action taken at its May 14, 2018, meeting.
In her Request for Review,
alleged that at the May 14, 2018,
meeting, the Board voted to move 3rd grade Stonington students to Memorial School without

providing any reference to that subject on the meeting agenda. Consequently, she alleged,
parents and citizens who were concerned about the issue did not attend the meeting.
On August 22, 2018, this office sent a copy of the Request for Review to the

Board and asked it to provide a copy of the agenda and meeting minutes of the May 14, 2018,
meeting together with a written response to
allegation. On September 20, 2018, the
Board president furnished a written response and a copy of the agenda. On September 21, 2018,
this office forwarded a copy of the Request for Review to
she replied on October 9,
2018.

Section 2. 02(

a) of

OMA ( 5 ILLS 120/ 2. 02(

generally requires a

provides: "

Any agenda required

The Board' s response to this office stated that at the May 14, 2018, meeting, the
Superintendent informed the Board

under

the " Superintendent'

Report"' agenda item that 3rd

grade Stonington students would be transferred to Memorial School. The response stated that " a

include establishing attendance units and assigning students to schools.
vote was taken

Regardless of whether the Board was required to take action to approve

transferring 3rd grade Stonington students to Memorial School, it is undisputed that the Board
voted on the matter. Neither " Superintendent Report" or any other item on the meeting agenda

identified the general subject matter of the Board's final action. Accordingly, this office
concludes that the Board violated section 2. 02( c) of OMA.

Although it does not appear practical at this time for the Board to remedy its

violation by holding another vote on the transfer after providing proper advance notice, the
Board should be mindful of its obligation to include the general subject matter of all final actions

RE:

OMA Request for Review — 2018, PAC 55458

Dear

This determination letter is issued pursuant to section 3. 5( b) of the Open Meetings
Act ( OMA) ( 5 ILCS 120/ 3. 5( b).( 2016)).

For the reasons that follow, the Public Access Bureau
concludes that no further action is warranted in this matter.

On October 24, 2018, the Public Access Bureau received your Request for
Review alleging that the City of Elmhurst ( City) Public Works & Buildings Committee
Committee) violated section 2. 06( d) OMA ( 5 ILCS 120/ 2. 06( d) ( West 2016)) because it had not

reviewed the minutes of the closed session portions of its meetings held in 2014, 2015, and 2018.

In particular, you stated that you had previously submitted a Request for Review to this office,

which was opened as 2018 PAC 52812, concerning the Committee's failure to conduct a semiannual review

of

closed session minutes.

You alleged that the Committee has continued to

violate section 2. 06( d) of OMA since this office issued a determination in that matter on August
28,

2018. You requested that the closed session minutes of meetings in 2014, 2015, and 2018 be

released because the Committee had not reviewed those minutes within 60 days of discovering
its failure to comply with the requirements of section 2. 06( d). of OMA.
Section 3. 5(

of

OMA ( 5 ILCS

120/ 3. 5(

provides:

A person who believes that a violation of this Act by a

period, but are discovered at a later date, not exceeding 2 years
after the alleged violation, by a person utilizing reasonable
diligence, the request for review may be made within 60 days of
the discovery of the alleged violation. The request for review must
be in writing, must be signed by the requester, and must include a
summary of the facts supporting the allegation.
The public policy underlying OMA is " that public bodies exist to aid in the conduct of the
people' s business and that the people have a right to be informed as to the conduct of their
business."

5 ILCS 120/ 1 ( West 2016).

In keeping with this policy, public bodies must

periodically review their closed session minutes, which are generally confidential and exempt

from disclosure under section 7( 1)( 1) of the Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA), 1 to determine
whether the need

for confidentiality

Section 2. 06( d)

still exists.

of

OMA

provides: "[

e] ach .

public body shall periodically, but no less than semi- annually, meet to review minutes of all
closed
meetings" to determine whether "( 1) the need for confidentiality, still exists as to all or
part of those minutes. or ( 2) that the minutes or portions thereof no longer require confidential
treatment and are available

for public inspection."

In 2018 PAC 52812, you submitted a Request for Review to this office on April

22, 2018, in which you alleged that the Committee had not held a semi- annual review of the,
minutes of its closed session meetings in 2014; 2015, 2017, and 2018. This office concluded that

although the Committee held a meeting on May 14, 2018, where the Committee reviewed the
minutes of it closed session meetings from 2017, the Committee had not adhered to its obligation
to review

closed

session minutes under

section 2. 06( d)

of

OMA. However, this office

specifically concluded that the Committee was not required to remedy the violation by disclosing
all of the unreviewed closed session minutes. 111. Att' y Gen. PAC Req. Rev. Ltr. 52812, issued
August 28, 2018, at 3- 4.
Your Request for Review to this office in this matter alleges the same facts as

your Request for Review in 2018 PAC 52812. In 2018 PAC 52812, this office reviewed those
facts together with the Committee' s written answer and your reply and concluded that the
Committee had violated OMA but was not required to remedy that violation by disclosing all of
the closed session minutes that had not been reviewed. In this matter, you again request this

office conclude that the Committee violated OMA by failing to review• all of its closed session
minutes and direct the Committee to release the unreviewed closed session minutes. Because

this office has previously reviewed the allegations in yourRequest for Review and concluded
that the Committee had violated OMA but that the remedial action you had requested was not

Dear

This determination is issued pursuant to section 3. 5( b) of the Open Meetings Act
OMA) ( 5 ILCS 120/ 3. 5( b) ( West 2016)).

For the reasons set forth below, the information you

have furnished provides no basis for the Public Access Counselor to conclude that the Village of

Cherry Valley ( Village) Board of Trustees ( Board) violated OMA in connection with the
construction project at issue in your allegations.
Section 3. 5(

a)

of

OMA ( 5 ILCS 120/ 3. 5(

a) (

West 2016)) provides,

in relevant

part:

A person who believes that a violation of this Act by a
public body has occurred may file a request for review with the

allegation: (

Emphasis

added.)

Your November 14, 2018, Request for Review stated that on May 24, 2018, a
building permit was issued for a parcel of property, but no public meetings were held on that
topic. Construction on the structure began in September 2018, you stated, alleging that the
Village violated various Village ordinancesand provisions of the Illinois Municipal Code ( 65
ILCS 5/ 1- 1- 1

et

seq. ( West 2016))

in the process. The Public Access Counselor' s authority to

resolve disputes, however, is limited to alleged violations of OMA and the Freedom of
Information

Act ( 5 ILCS 140/ 1

et

seq. ( West 2016)).

See 15 ILCS 205/ 7( c)( 3) ( West 2016).

Because your allegations concerning Village ordinances and the Illinois Municipal Code do not

provide a factual basis for a violation of OMA, they are not subject to review by this office.

OMA concerns the transparency with which public bodies meet and conduct
public business; it does not govern substantive zoning or construction specifications. Gosnell v.
Hogan, 179 I11. App. 3d 161, 171 ( 5th Dist. 1989) (" The Open Meetings Act provides that public
agencies exist to aid in the conduct of the people' s business, and that the intent of the Act is to
assure

that

agency

actions

be

taken

openly

and

that their deliberations be

conducted

openly.").

public body generally violates OMA by holding a meeting with insufficient openness, not by
declining to hold a meeting about a particular subject. Therefore, the allegation that neither the

Board nor any other public body of the Village held a meeting about the construction project
does not indicate that the Board or any other Village body violated OMA. Accordingly, this
office has determined that no further action is warranted in this matter.

OMA Request for Review —2014 PAC 31894

and Ms. Mienheinier:

On October 21, 2014, this office received

Request for

Review alleging that the Village of New Douglas ( Village) Board ( Board) did not provide
sufficient advanced notice of its October 20, 2014, meeting as required by sections 2. 02( a) and
2. 02( c)

of

the Open Meetings

Act ( OMA) ( 5 ILCS

120/ 2. 02(

a), ( c) (

West 2014)).

In particular,

alleged that the agenda for the meeting was not posted 48 hours before the meeting
because the Board did not post the agenda in the post office lobby until after 1 p. m. on October
19, 2014.

0

Section 2. 02(

a)

of

OMA

states "[

ajn agenda for each regular meeting shall be

posted at the principal office of the public body and at the location where the meeting is to be
held at least 48 hours in advance of the holding of the meeting." " The public body conducting a
public meeting shall ensure that at least one copy of any requested notice and agenda for the
meeting is continuously available I' or public review during the entire 48- hour period preceding
the

meeting."

5 ILCS 120/ 2. 02(

c) (

West 2014).

Section 2. 02( c) of OMA further provides that

i] f a notice or agenda is not continuously available for the full 48- hour period due to actions
outside of the control of the public body, then that lack of availability does not invalidate any
meeting or action taken at a meeting."

On December 2, 2014, this office forwarded a copy of the Request for Review to
the Board and asked it to respond to

allegations. On December 3, 2014, the Board

responded by stating that a copy o r the agenda was placed on the door of the community center
where the meeting was to be held un October 13, 2014. The Board stated that it also posted a

copy of the agenda at the post orrice on October 17, 2014, but that someone had removed the
agenda

when

the

Village

clerk

visited

the post office

again

on

October

20; 2014.

In his reply,

alleged that the Board Bailed to continuously post the agenda for the meeting because
it did not secure the agenda in place at the post office. Because section 2. 02( a)" of OMA only
requires that the Board post the agenda at its principal office and the location' of the meeting and
because the post office is not the village' s principal office or the location of the meeting, the
Board

was

not

required

to post

the

agenda

for

the

meeting

at

the

post

office.

Further, this office

has previously determined that a public body does not violate OMA when a properly posted
agenda is removed from that location due to actions outside of the public body' s control. See,
e. g., I11. Att' y Gen. PAC Req. Rev. Ltr. 49761, issuedNovember 9, 2017, at 4. Because the

available information indicates that a copy of the agenda for the October 20, 2014, meeting was
posted at the location of the meeting and was continuously available at that location for 48 hours
before the meeting, this office concludes that the Board did not violate sections 2. 02( a) and
2. 02( c) of OMA.

The Public Access Counselor has determined that resolution of this matter does
not

require

the issuance

of a

binding

opinion.

For the reasons explained below, this office has

determined that no further action is warranted in this matter.

On November 13, 2018, this office received your Request for Review alleging

that the Village of Worth ( Village) Board of Trustees ( Board) may have violated OMA in
connection with final action at its November 7, 2018, meeting. In particular, your Request for
Review stated that the Board' s agenda for the November 7, 2018, meeting included an ordinance
to approve the modification of the Village' s parking code, which you assert the Board voted to
approve without first discussing in an open meeting. You indicate that when you asked the

Village's attorney whether members of the Board had met in private to discuss the matter, the
attorney told you that they had not met as a group, but instead the president of the Village had
individually briefed the members of the Board on the issue.
Section

provides that " all meetings of public bodies shall be open to the public unless excepted in

c)

and

in

with

accordance

Section

2a."

Section 1. 02 ( 5 ILCS 120/ 1. 02 ( West

defines a " public meeting" as:

A] ny gathering, whether in person or by video or audio
conference,

telephone

call, electronic

means ( such as, without

limitation, electronic mail, electronic chat, and instant messaging),
or other means of contemporaneous interactive communication,

of a majority of a quorum of the members of a public body

held for the purpose of discussing public business or, for a 5 member public body, a quorum of the members of a public body
held for

the

purpose

of

discussing

public

business. ( Emphasis

added.)

Under this statutory definition, a " meeting" requires a majority of a quorum of the
members of the Board to engage in contemporaneous, interactive communication concerning
public business to constitute a meeting of the Board subject to the procedural safeguards and
requirements of OMA. The Board is comprised of six members and the president. Accordingly,
four Board members comprise a quorum, and a majority of the quorum is three members. The
information

provided in your Request for Review does not allege or indicate that at least three

members of the Board met in private to discuss the modification of the parking code. Therefore,
the individual discussions with the president did not constitute a meeting subject to the
requirements of OMA.

Moreover, there is no indication that the Board failed to take action openly in
connection with the modification of the parking code. The available information indicates that
the Board took final action on that issue in open session at the November 7, 2018, meeting.
Although you appear to indicate that the Board did not deliberate on the modification, you do not

allege that the Board failed to publicly recite the " nature of the matter being considered" to

inform the public of the business being conducted as required by section 2( e) of OMA ( 5 ILCS
120/ 2( e) ( West 2017 Supp.), as amended by Public Act 100- 646, effective July 31, 2018). In
Board of Education of Springfield School District No. 186 v. Attorney General of Illinois, 2017

This office

discussions

in the future. See 5 ILCS

For the reasons explained below, this office has

For the reasons explained below, this office has

Act ( OMA) ( 5 ILCS

determined that no further action is warranted in this matter.
On November 26, 2018, you submitted a Request for Review to this office

alleging that the Village of Onarga ( Village) Board of Trustees ( Board) violated OMA by
posting its agendas on a bulletin board in the Village' s library that was not easily visible to the
public.

Section

3. 5(

of

OMA ( 5 ILCS

view, you

do

not

provide

any facts concerning

a specific

In short, you have

not identified any specific meeting that occurred within the past 60 days for which the agenda for
a Board meeting was unavailable for public viewing. Additionally, you suggest that the Board' s
agendas may not be posted at least 48 hours before meetings. However, you do not provide any
facts to support that allegation.

Accordingly, because your Request for Review does not include facts to support
your allegation. that a violation of OMA occurred,

this office has determined

that no further

As explained below, the Public Access Bureau

recommends that the Board of Trustees ( Board) of the Village of Wheeling ( Village) review

portions of its rules and procedures concerning public comment at meetings.
BACKGROUND

On September 7, 2017,

submitted a Request for Review to

the Public Access Bureau alleging that the Board violated OMA during its September 5, 2017,
meeting by enforcing restrictions on public comment that are not written in the municipal code.
Specifically,
alleged that she attempted to comment about two specific trustees and

her claim that they were improperly operating home- based businesses but was interrupted by the
Village President, Mr. Patrick Horcher, who informed her that comments should be addressed to
the Board as a whole and that she could not engage in personal attacks against individual
members.

She contended

that the purpose of her comments

was to hold the trustees accountable

in their enforcement of the Village' s residential zoning ordinance and dealings with home- based
businesses.
also asserted that she was unaware of any Village rules that required her
to address comments

to the Board as a whole or that prohibited

personal

attacks.

On September 18, 2017, this office forwarded a copy of the Request for Review
to the Board and asked it to provide this office with copies of the Board' s established and

recorded rules governing public comment, together with a written response to

OMA allegations. This office also asked the Board for a copy of the meeting agenda, open
session minutes, and any verbatim recordings of the meeting.. On September 27, 2017, this

office received a written response with links to copies of the meeting agenda, the Village Code,
and video recordings of past Board meetings, including the meeting at issue. This office also
received a copy of the draft meeting minutes for this office' s confidential review. On October 3,
2017, this office forwarded a copy of the Board' s response to
she replied that same
day, requesting from the Village a copy of "Robert' s Rules of Order" as referenced in the Board' s
response.

DETERMINATION

It is " the public policy of this State that its citizens shall be given advance notice
of and the right to attend all meetings at which any business of a public body is discussed or
acted

upon

in any way."

efficiently.

Notwithstanding the legitimate interest in establishing rules governing order and
decorum, in order to withstand constitutional muster, any restrictions on public comment that are

content -based must be narrowly drawn to serve compelling state interests. See LA. Rana
Enterprises, Inc. v. City of Aurora, 630 F. Supp. 2d 912, 922 ( N. D. I11. 2009). As the Ninth
Circuit has explained:

An ordinance that governs the decorum of a city council meeting is
not facially overbroad if it only permits a presiding officer to eject
an attendee for actually disturbing or impeding a meeting:
However, actually disturbing or impeding a meeting means actual
disruption of the meeting; a municipality cannot merely define
disturbance in any way it chooses, e. g., it may not deem any

OMA does not require a public official to respond to questions

that are directed

to him or her. See, e. g., I11. Att' y Gen. PAC Req. Rev. Ltr. 35858, issued October 20, 2015, at

Because OMA does not require public officials

Village' s established

to respond

to questions,

and because

the

and recorded rules permit the Village Manager to respond on behalf of

the Board, this office concludes that Manager Sfondilis did not improperly interrupt
at the beginning of her comments, and Trustee Krueger Was not required to respond to
questions.

On the other hand, with respect to the Board' s interruptions

comments when she directed remarks towards or made claims about specific Trustees, the •

Board did not demonstrate that its restrictions were reasonably necessary to maintain order,

efficiency.

Encompassed within the right to comment is the right of members of

a

zoning issue.

Although those

comments were directed at the Board members personally, they concerned the issue of the

Board' s enforcement of the Village zoning ordinance. Accordingly, this matter is
distinguishable from the Federal District Court case the Board argued is similar. Scroggins v.

City of Topeka. Kan., 2 F. Supp. 2d 1362, 1373 ( D. Kan. 1998) ( city council did not violate
first amendment to the United States Constitution by restricting personal comments about an
appointee to a mayoral commission that were not directly relevant to the business of the
public body).
Additionally, this office has reviewed section 2. 03. 060( a) of the Code and notes
that it does not prohibit a member of the public from asking the Board to reconsider a decision
previously made. Section 2. 03. 060( a) of the Code defines " village business" as including

information about village events; issues that the public body has the authority to address; items
listed on the agenda; and items or issues previously voted on by the village board or that the
village

board has the authority to

consider or vote

on

in

the

future." ( Empha' sis

added.)

Under

that broad definition, comments pertaining to the Board' s enforcement of a zoning ordinance
appear to

fall

the

within

meaning

of "

village

business,"

even if the Board has previously voted on

the matter. In any event, the recording of the meeting indicates that the Board' s restrictions of
comments were directed towards her references to particular trustees in connection
with public business of the Board, rather than repetitiousness.

The Board also highlighted
conduct at previous meetings, including
the Board' s August 21, 2017, meeting. This office has reviewed the recording of the Board' s
August 21, 2017, meeting and recognizes the Board' s concerns about the animated manner in
which

appeared to address the Board about the alleged businesses at issue. A public

body's attempts to preserve decorum may not be unreasonable in those instances in which a
member of the public engages in demonstrative

actions and conduct that threatens disruption or

becomes disruptive to the meeting. See Steinburg v. Chesterfield County Planning Comm' n, 527

public comments during its September 5, 2017, meeting.

RE:

OMA Request for Review — 2018 PAC 54146

Dear Ms. Ajster and Mr. Biederstedt:

This determination letter is issued pursuant to section 3. 5( e) of the Open Meetings
Act ( OMA) ( 5 ILCS 120/ 3, 5(

e) (

West 2016)).

For the reasons that follow, the Public Access

Bureau concludes that the City of Peru ( City) Planning and Zoning Commission ( Commission)
did not provide sufficient advance notice of its vote to amend the City' s Zoning Code during its
July 18, 2018, meeting.
On July 23, 2018, Ms. Julie L. Ajster, of Ajster Law Office, submitted a Request

for Review to. the Public Access Bureau alleging that the Commission potentially violated OMA
in

connection

with

its

July

18, 2018, meeting.

Specifically, Ms. Ajster alleged that the

Commission improperly took final action during the meeting when it.voted to amend the City' s
Zoning. Code without having set forth the general subject matter of that final action on the
agenda.
The Commission' s
July 18, 2018, meeting agenda listed the item: " Petition of Casey' s

On July 31, 2018, this office forwarded a copy of the Request for Review to the
Commission and asked it to provide this office with copies of the agenda and minutes of its July
18, 2018, meeting for this office' s confidential review, together with a written response to Ms.
Ajster' s allegation. Not having received a response, this office sent a second letter to the
Commission seeking the same materials on August 16, 2018.
On August 17, 2018, this office received the requested materials as well as two

vote to amend the Zoning Code, claiming that " municipal and land use attorneys often use the.

Bureau left a voicemail for the Commission requesting a copy of Article XV of the City' s Zoning
Code4 which was in effect at the time of its July 18, 2018, meeting. On August 27, 2018, this
office received copies of that article and Ordinance No. 6141, 5 which the Commission explained

some of its provisions."
Jones, 217 1I1. App. 3d at 89. Thus, the Commission' s definitional
argument is unavailing.
Addressing

the

meaning

of section

2. 02(

c),

the Commission further argued:

The agenda does not need to have the specificity of the exact
provisions of the City Zoning ordinance that may be recommended
for change by the Planning and Zoning Commission nor the term
that would be used in drafting the City ordinances to effectuate the
change. To require such would tie the Planning and Zoning
Commission's hands so that if, based on evidence at the hearing, or
interpretations of existing zoning ordinances, differing options or
solutions were identified, the hearings would be endlessly and
needlessly continued to provide specific agenda items. This is not
the

intent

nor

requirements of the

Open Meetings Act." 61

Nonetheless, the Commission also noted that it had published a hearing notice in a local
newspaper for the July 18, 2018, meeting, which depicted a zoning variance and an amendment
to the Zoning Code as separate actions sought by Casey' s Retail Company."
If the Commission
was able to delineate and set out both of those actions in the hearing notice dated June 27, 2018,
it is unclear why it would have posed any difficulty to do the same in the agenda posted over two
weeks later.

Notice of Hearing Before the Planning/ Zoning Commission of the City of Peru, Illinois ( June 27,
2018).

 Ms. Julie L. Ajster

The Honorable Doug Biederstedt
December 3, 2018
Page 6

Based on this office' s review of the City' s Zoning Code in effect at the time of the
Commission' s July 18, 2018, meeting, variances and amendments are distinct actions. The

Zoning Code provides separate administrative processes for variances and amendments.
Variances are addressed in section 15. 08, called " Variations. i18 In this section, the Zoning Code
repeatedly references " the property in question" and the specific property' s " owner."
Amendments
are addressed
in section 15. 11 of the Zoning Code, which states that "[ t] he
regulations imposed and the districts created under the authority of this Ordinance may be
amended, from time to time, by ordinance in accordance with applicable Illinois Statutes. i19
Thus, as articulated in Jones v. City ofCarbondale, a variance applies to a particular parcel of
property, whereas an amendment can have much broader impact.

This office' s review of the agenda for the Commission' s July 18, 2018, meeting
confirmed that no item identified the general subject matter of the final action that the

Commission took to amend the Zoning Code. A member of the public reading the agenda in
advance of the Commission' s July 18, 2018, meeting would not have had notice that the
Commission

planned

to vote

on that

matter,

as

only

the variance

was

listed.

Although the

Commission argues that " variance" and " amendment" have the same meaning, the minutes
specifically

list two

separate actions that were

approved— an amendment and a variance.

Further, the Zoning Code provides separate processes for each type of action in accordance with
their

substantive

differences.

An agenda item for a business' s request for a variance does not

provide the general subject matter of a Zoning Code amendment because, as Ms. Ajster pointed

out, the entire City may be affected by a Zoning Code amendment, whereas a variance directly
affects only a specific property. Accordingly, this office concludes that the Commission violated

section 2. 02( c) of OMA during its July 18, 2018, meeting by approving a text amendment to its

Zoning Code without having listed the general subject matter of that final action on the meeting
agenda. Because of the date of the violation, the Commission is unable to take the appropriate

remedial action of reconsidering and re -voting on the amendment during a properly -noticed open
meeting. However, this office cautions the Commission to list in its future meeting agendas the

general subject matter of each item on which it intends to vote and to otherwise comply with all
of the requirements

of OMA.

Dear Mr. Kraft:

This determination is issued pursuant to section 3. 5( b) of the Open Meetings Act

OMA) ( 5 ILCS 120/ 3. 5( b) ( West 2016)).

For the reasons set forth below, the information you

have furnished provides no basis for the Public Access Counselor to conclude that the Board of
Trustees of DuPage Township ( Board) violated OMA in connection with the public comment
portion of its October 23, 2018, meeting.

Township Supervisor, Mr. William M. Mayer, " selectively enforced" them) Additionally,
you argued that some aspects of the Board' s new public comment rules impermissibly restrict the
the

public' s

right to address

its

You

As to your argument about when public comment rules take effect, section 80- 10

during a meeting. The Board' s public comment ordinance stated that it " shall be effective upon
its passage." 3 Therefore, the Board' s new public comment rules took effect before the public
comment portion of the Board' s October 23, 2018, meeting.

Moreover, even a public body that has not adopted rules governing public
has the inherent authority to put a stop to meeting disruptions. 1. A. Rana Enterprises,
Inc. v. City of Aurora, 630 F. Supp. 2d 912, 924 ( N. D. I11. 2009) ( noting that a chairman of a
meeting may put an end to disruptive speech).
The video recording shows that you disrupted the

comment

meeting• by refusing to stop speaking long after your time had expired, raising your voice over
Supervisor Mayer' s and requiring physical intervention to leave the meeting room.
Turning to your argument that the Board selectively enforced its public comment
rules, a public body that has adopted rules governing public comment violates section 2. 06( g) of
OMA

when

it

either: (

1) prohibits a member of the public from addressing its members in a

manner inconsistent with its established and recorded rules; or ( 2) prohibits a member of the

public from providing public comment pursuant to its established and recorded rules that
unreasonably restrict that person' s right to address public officials. 111. Att' y Gen. Pub. Acc. Op.

No. 14- 009, issued September 4, 2014, at 5- 7. Because " the primary purpose of adopting rules
governing public comment pursuant to' section 2. 06( g) of OMA is to accommodate the speaker's
statutory right to address the public body, while ensuring that the public body can maintain order
and

decorum

at

public meetings[,)"

4

allowing a commenter some extra time to address the

members of the public body generally does not run afoul of section 2. 06( g) of OMA, in contrast

with cutting off a commenter who was not being disruptive or otherwise violating the public
body' s public comment rules before expiration of the time period prescribed by those rules. The
video recording of the meeting reflects that Supervisor Mayer allowed another commenter who

Similarly, your claims that individuals ate food during the meeting, spoke without

violated anyone' s right to address its members. Because the facts you have alleged, together with

the video recording of the meeting, do not indicate that the Board improperly restricted any

On September 29, 2014, Mr. John Kraft submitted a Request for Review to the

rules governing public comment and the Board' s implementation of those rules at the meeting.

the meetings)

In response to a request from this office, the public body submitted a detailed

answer to the allegations in the Request for Review, as well as the relevant agenda and meeting
minutes.

The Public Access Bureau has reviewed the materials submitted by Mr. Kraft and
the Board. As noted in the Board' s response, Mr. Kraft does not allege, nor is there any

indication, that he or any other member of the public was prohibited from addressing the Board
at the September 25, 2014, meeting. On the contrary, the available information indicates that

everyone present at the meeting who wished to comment was permitted to do so even though the
Board required people who wished to comment on agenda items and non -agenda items to speak

at separate times in the meeting. The Request for Review alleges that the first speaker was
interrupted during the agenda item public comment portion of the meeting and required to speak

during the non -agenda item portion even though her topic pertained to an agenda item; no facts
were provided to support the allegation that the speaker' s public comment pertained to an agenda
item.

In the absence of evidence that the Board enforced its rules or practices concerning public

comment to improperly restrict a member of the public from exercising his or her statutory right
to address the Board, there is no basis for this office to conclude that the Board violated section

2. 06( g) of OMA at its September 25, 2014, meeting. See, e. g., 111. Att' y Gen. PAC Req. Rev. Ltr.
50371, issued November 30, 2017, at 2.
Moreover, the available information does not support the allegation that the

September 25, 2014, meeting was not reasonably accessible to all members of the public who
to attend the meeting. 2 In its response to this office, the Board explained that its

wished

meetings are held in a room where:

T] he Board sits at a horseshoe shaped table facing the audience,
and there are 30 general public seats available. At the front of the

general seating area are press tables and to the side of the room is
an area for people video recording or photographing the meeting.
Mr. Kraft' s Request for Review also alleged that the Board violated OMA by providing members

of the press a designated section of seating in the Board room but did not allow him to sit within that section.
Although section 2. 01 of OMA ( 5 ILCS 120/ 2. 01 ( West 2016)) requires a venue be reasonably accessible to the

public, no provision of OMA governs the way in which a public body chooses to assign seating for its meetings, if at
all. Therefore, this office will not review this allegation because it does not set forth facts supporting an OMA
violation.

Nevertheless, recognizing that unexpected overflow crowds are
possible, the College also uses state- of-the- art technology to

broadcast the meeting to nearby overflow rooms where ample

seating ( 80 seats) and comfortable room conditions prevail. 13)

from exercising

or

In

fact, there is no indication that those who wished to attend were unable to be physically present

room.

Even assuming that all members of the public who wished to attend the

meeting were not able to be physically present in the meeting room, section 2. 01 of OMA
contains no such requirement. See Gerwin v. Livingston County Board, 345 111. App. 3d 352, .
361 ( 4th Dist. 2003) ("[

that

interested members of the public, such that they may see and hear all proceedings in reasonable
comfort

and

safety.") (

Emphasis in original.))

Additionally, Mr. Kraft' s Request for Review alleged that the doors to the Board
meeting were locked, which restricted reasonable access to the September 25, 2014, meeting.
The Board' s response clarified that the doors were briefly locked due to an electronic locking
device that engages automatically at 11: 00 p. m. and that the College police officers quickly
unlocked the doors allowing all who wished to reenter to do so. There is no indication that any

individual who wished to attend the meeting was prevented from doing so. This office has

previously determined that a brief and inadvertent locking of meeting room doors in which no
member of the public was prevented from attending a meeting does not violate the requirements
of section 2. 01 of OMA. See I11. Att' y Gen. PAC Req. Rev. Ltr. 36975, issued June 26, 2017, at

5. Accordingly, the Public Access Bureau concludes that Board did not violate the requirements
of OMA in connection with its September 25, 2014, meeting.

On August 21, 2015, this office forwarded a copy of the Request for Review to
the Board and asked it to respond to

allegations.

On August 31, 2015, this office

received a written response from the Board' s attorney, Mr. Shawn Flaherty. On September 23,

2015, this office forwarded a copy of the response to

who replied that same day.

In the Board' s written response, Mr. Flaherty explained that
had
called the Board' s attention to her concern that the Board had improperly discussed certain
matters in closed session during its July 7, 2015, meeting. He stated that the "[ t] he Board took
this concern very seriously, which resulted in a decision by the District Board members to vote
to release the minutes of every closed session meeting for calendar year 2015 with redactions as

Flaherty confirmed that he reviewed those closed session minutes at the request of the Board and
that it was his " determination

Mr. Flaherty asserted that the Board took immediate

corrective action by voting to approve the release of the closed session minutes, including the
minutes of the two closed sessions within the scope of this office' s review ( June 8, 2015, and

This office' s review of the closed session minutes from the Board' s June 8, 2015,

and July 7, 2015, meetings reveals that the Board held unauthorized closed session discussions
during each meeting. Accordingly, the. Board violated the openness requirements of OMA at
r each meeting. Because the Board subsequently released copies of its closed session minutes
from 2015, which are detailed, and also arranged for its members to take additional OMA

training, this office has determined that no further remedial action is required under these
circumstances.

The Public Access Counselor has determined that the resolution of this matter

does not require the issuance of a binding opinion. This file is closed. If you have any
questions, please contact me at the Chicago address on the bottom of the first page of this letter.

Peoria
(
City
City), pursuant to section 3. 5( a) of the Open Meetings Act ( OMA) ( 5 ILCS

alleging that the Property Tax. Appeal Board ( PTAB) violated OMA at
Request for Review from Mr. Robert

its October 12, 2016, meeting.

In particular, Mr. McCoy alleged that PTAB' s meeting agenda

did not provide sufficient notice of final action in violation of section 2. 02( c) of OMA (5 ILCS

In addition to filing a Request for Review with the Public Access Bureau, the City

filed an administrative review action with the Illinois Appellate Court for the Third District

contesting PTAB' s decision to reduce the assessed valuation of two pieces of property in. a tax
appeal in which the City had attempted to intervene as a party. In the administrative review

action, the City also alleged that PTAB had violated sections 2. 02( c) and 2( e) of OMA at its

remands the matter to PTAB, which remediates the OMA violations. See City of East Peoria v.
Property Tax Appeal Board, et al., 2018 IL App ( 3d) 160689- U. Because the OMA violations
alleged in the City' s Request for Review pending with the Public Access Bureau are the same

RE:

Dear

OMA Request for Review — 2017 PAC 50176

and Mr. Brady:
This determination letter is issued pursuant to section 3. 5( e) of the Open Meetings

Act ( OMA) ( 5 ILCS 120/ 3. 5(

e) (

West 2016)).

For the reasons that follow, the Public Access

Bureau concludes that the Resource, Space, and Budget Committee ( RSB Committee) of

Northern Illinois University ( University) is a public body that improperly held meetings without
adhering to the requirements of OMA.

BACKGROUND

On October 23, 2017,

submitted a Request for Review to

the Public Access Bureau alleging that the RSB Committee had held meetings without following
the requirements of OMA. Specifically, he alleged that:
1.

There was no 12 month posting of the meeting at the beginning

the RSB Committee to clarify whether it holds meetings on a regular basis and, if so, to clarify
whether

agenda was posted. Additionally, this office asked the Committee to provide this office with
copies of the agenda, minutes, and any recordings of that meeting. On November 13, 2017, this

office received a written response from the University and copies of an agenda, a transcript of a
chair's report, and notes of the October 6, 2017, meeting. In its written response, the University
asserted that the RSB Committee is not a " public body" subject to the requirements of OMA. On
November 15, 2017, this office forwarded a copy of the University' s response to

A] II legislative, executive, administrative or advisory bodies of
the State, counties, townships, cities, villages, incorporated

towns,

school districts and all other municipal corporations, boards,

bureaus, committees or commissions of this State, and any
subsidiary bodies of any of the foregoing including but not limited
to committees and subcommittees which are supported in whole or

in part by tax revenue, or which expend tax revenue, except the
General Assembly and committees or commissions thereof.
An " advisory

body," for purposes of OMA, is an entity that has defined responsibilities and is a
formal part of the structure of the public body that it advises. Board of Regents of Regency
University System v. Reynard, 292 Ill. App. 3d 968, 977- 78 ( 4th Dist. 1997). In contrast, OMA

is not intended to open to the public the deliberations of merely informal advisory committees
who discuss internal" affairs of a public body. Pope v. Parkinson, 48 Ill. App. 3d 797, 800 ( 4th
Dist. 1977).

Factors to consider in determining whether a group constitutes an advisory body

under OMA include:

who appoints the members of the entity, the formality of their
appointment, and whether they are paid for their tenure; the entity' s
assigned duties, including duties reflected in the entity' s bylaws or
authorizing statute; whether its role is solely advisory or whether it

also has a deliberative or investigative function; whether the entity
is subject to government control or otherwise accountable to any
public body; whether the group has a budget; its place within the
larger organization or institution of which it is a part; and the

impact of decisions or recommendations that the group makes.
University Professionals of Illinois v. Stukel, 344 Ill. App. 3d 856,
865 ( 1st Dist. 2003).

In Stukel, the plaintiff alleged that a group of presidents and chancellors of public
Council),

universities (

IBHE),

which made recommendations to the Illinois Board of Higher Education

violated OMA by meeting privately before IBHE meetings to discuss issues related to

funding for public education. Stukel, 344 I11. App. 3d at 857- 58. The court held that the Council
was not an advisory body of IBHE in part because it was not incorporated into the formal

organizational structure of IBHE, a factor that the court identified as a " primary consideration in

OMA does not apply to voluntary " technical staff'

Conversely, in Reynard, the appellate court concluded that the Athletic Council of

Illinois State University ( ISU) was an advisory body subject to FOIA. Reynard, 292 111. App. 3d

been occasions when he has done so. The Council deals only with internal ISU matters, it has no

Reynard, 292111. App. 3d at 972. In concluding that

The University explained that the RSB Committee' s composition is set forth in

Article 2. 6 of the University Bylaws and Article 3. 6 of the Faculty Senate Bylaws. Article 2. 6 of
the University Bylaws provides that the RSB Committee is to be comprised of 12 faculty
members, one student appointed by the Student Association, one Supportive Professional staff

member and one Operating Staff member, and three nonvoting members. Six of the faculty
members must be members of the University Council and appointed with the advice and consent

of the University Council, while the remaining six must be members of the Faculty Senate and

additional compensation for their participation on the RSB Committee.

2) The entity' s assigned duties, including duties reflected in the entity' s
bylaws or authorizing statute
Under Article 2. 6 of the University Bylaws, the duties of the RSB Committee

include participating in long- range planning with University leadership; advising University
leadership regarding goals and priorities for the use of resources, space, and budgets, -with
periodic progress evaluations; making reports and recommendations to the Faculty Senate and

the University Council regarding resource allocations and utilization; and advising University
leadership on critical budget issues.
3)

Whether the entity' s role is solely advisory or whether it also has a
deliberative or investigative function

The University contended that the RSB Committee' s role is merely advisory and
thus akin to the group analyzed in Stukel. The University argued, in pertinent part:

It is clear that the Athletic Council in Reynard had

significantly more authority and responsibility in the creation and
development of policies and budgets of the athletics program at

Illinois State University than the RSB Committee has at Northern
Illinois University. The budget matters that are reviewed by the

RSB Committee are not created or developed by the RSB
Committee. Instead, they are created and developed by university
administrators.

The RSB Committee is utilized to provide

important insight, perspective and knowledge from its membership
for proposed budgets and budgeting policy initiatives. However, it

4) Whether the entity is subject to government control
or otherwise accountable to any public body
The

University claimed that "[ t] he RSB Committee is not subject to control or

However, the University also directed this office to Article 6. l . 2 of

which provides:

If action is taken

without University Council approval, which the University Council
agrees ( by majority vote) represents a substantive change in
academic policy, the committee may be asked to submit the action
to the University Council for review.

Further, as noted above, six of the faculty members are members of the University Council who
are appointed with the advice and consent of the University Council, while the other six
members are members of the Faculty Senate who are appointed with the advice and consent of

that entity. Thus, the University exercises some degree of control over the RSB Committee by
influencing who serves on the RSB Committee.

argued that the RSB Committee is part

Regents.

in the University Council' s bylaws " just like the Athletic Council of ISU [ has] its duties and

set forth by the Academic Senate of ISU" in Reynard.14 He also highlighted

responsibilities [ ]

that both groups have a similar composition of members. Additionally,

contended that the Faculty Senate is under the control of the University Council pursuant to
University Constitution, which provides that "[ t] he university bylaws shall specify
the membership of the Faculty Senate, its method of selection, and its duties and
responsibilities[,]

and RSB Committee.

After reviewing both parties' arguments in light of the Stukel factors, this office
concludes that the RSB Committee is a public body subject to the requirements of OMA. The
RSB Committee' s duties are defined in the University' s bylaws, indicating that the RSB
Committee is

part of the

structure

of

the

University—

a primary

consideration in determining whether it is subject to OMA. In addition, the bylaws specify the
RSB Committee' s composition and the lengths of its members' terms. The clearly assigned •

responsibilities, composition, and service periods signify the formality of the RSB Committee.

Although the RSB Committee does not have investigative powers and while its members do not

receive additional compensation, the University acknowledged that the RSB Committee
provide[ s] important insight, perspective and knowledge from its membership for proposed
16
budgets and budgeting policy initiatives."
The broad duties set forth in the bylaws suggest that
the RSB Committee has a considerable deliberative function, offering input on both short- and

Tong -term budget matters affecting the distribution of resources and space to the University' s
various

constituencies.

Further, the RSB Committee is accountable to the University Council and the
University' s administration.

As noted above, its members are appointed with the advice and

consent of the University Council and the Faculty Senate, and the University Constitution
requires that the RSB Committee
report all actions to the University Council.
In addition, the
University's bylaws provide that the RSB Committee shall " meet with the president and the
executive vice president' and provost, together and/ or separately, at least two times a semester, to
offer

and

17 The RSB Committee' s periodic reporting to the

University Council and key University officials indicates that there is significant University
oversight of the

RSB Committee'

s activities.

Additionally, although the RSB Committee does

not have a budget of its own or make binding determinations, the University acknowledges that it
makes impactful recommendations. Because OMA defines " public body" to include advisory
bodies of'a public body, and because the RSB Committee has key characteristics of an advisory
body, this office concludes that the RSB Committee is subject to the requirements of OMA.

In a June 1, 2018, e- mail to an Assistant Attorney General Bureau in the Public
Access Bureau, the University' s Acting Vice President and General Counsel, Mr. Gregory Brady,
confirmed that the acting president of the University had announced in December 2017 that the

University was working to bring the University Council and its standing committees into
compliance with OMA. The announcement explained that " the University would take steps in

compliant

following steps to comply with OMA:

Written agendas for each meeting were created.
Those agendas were then posted online and physically at

the building where RSB was meeting.
RSB took attendance and made sure there was physically'
present quorum.

RSB kept written minutes of the meetings and have posted
them once approved.

Mr. Brady further stated that the University planned to ask all members of the

University Council and its standing committees to complete the online OMA training when they
reconvened in the fall semester. The measures taken by the University to provide notice of
committee meetings, record minutes, and allow an opportunity for public comments indicate that

the University is actively working to ensure that the RSB Committee and other standing
committees of the University Council comply with OMA' s requirements. Accordingly, no

further

remedial action is warranted.

not require the issuance of a binding opinion. This letter shall serve to close this matter. If you

RE:

OMA Request for Review — 2018 PAC 55844

Dear

This determination is issued pursuant to section 3. 5( b) of the Open Meetings Act
OMA) ( 5 ILCS 120/ 3. 5(

b) (

West 2016)).

For the reasons set forth below, the Public Access
Bureau has determined that no fiuther action is warranted in this matter.

On November 26, 2018, this office received your Request for Review alleging
that the Village of Sherman ( Village) Board of Trustees ( Board) violated OMA in connection

with its November 20, 2018, meeting. Specifically, you alleged that the Board held discussions
about a " Play System" for the Village Park without adhering to the• requirements of OMA prior
to voting to approve a bid for the project

Additionally, you questioned the timing of the public comment

provides that "[

a] ll meetings of public bodies shall be open

to the public unless excepted in subsection ( c) and closed in accordance with Section 2a."
Section 1. 02 of OMA ( 5 ILCS 120/ 1. 02 ( West 2016))'
defines a " meeting" subject to the Act as:

A] ny gathering, whether in person or by video or audio

limitation, electronic mail, electronic chat, and instant messaging),
or other means of contemporaneous

public body, a quorum of the members of a public body held for

If a majority of a quorum is not present, a gathering of the members of a public

body is not a " meeting" subject to OMA. See, for example, 111. Att'y Gen. PAC Req. Rev. Ltr.

This office has reviewed the video recording you referenced, which depicts a
portion of the Board' s November 20, 2018, meeting. The recording reflects that you stepped up

to a podium and inquired about any discussions that the Board had held prior to its vote on the

bid for the Play System. You noted that the Village's website stated that its staff would work
closely with members of the Committee, Sherman elementary, and the community as part of a
park equipment selection process. Additionally, you noted that there had been no public

meetings about the park or selection process. Mayor Clatfelter responded by confirming that
there had been no Board meetings regarding the Play System; he acknowledged that the Village
administrator had engaged in discussions concerning the selection process, but explained that
any communications between the Village' s administration and trustees were on an individual
basis.

Your Request for Review has not alleged facts sufficient to demonstrate that the

Committee or the Board held any meetings about the Play System without adhering to the
requirements

of

OMA.

8 Although the Board' s March 6, 2018, meeting minutes suggest that the

Committee was to hold meetings regarding the Play System, it appears that discussions

concerning possible vendors consisted of communications between Village staff and individual
Board members. As discussed above, OMA requires a majority of a quorum of a public body' s
members to be engaged in " contemporaneous interactive communication" in order for their

communications to potentially constitute a " meeting" subject to the requirements of OMA.
While you contend that individual communications with trustees circumvent OMA' s

requirements on conducting public business in open meetings, OMA generally does not prohibit
individual9 members of a public body from communicating with staff about matters of public
business.
Because your Request for Review does not set forth facts indicating that a majority of
a quorum of the trustees engaged in contemporaneous interactive communications concerning
the Play System outside of an open meeting, no further action is warranted as to your claim that
the Board improperly conducted public business on that topic in private.
As to your complaint about the timing of public comments, section 2. 06( g) of
provides that "[ a] ny person shall be permitted an
opportunity to address public officials under the rules established and recorded by the public
body." Under the plain language of section 2. 06( g), a public body must provide an opportunity
for public comment at each meeting, subject to the rules established and recorded by the public
OMA ( 5 ILCS 120/ 2. 06( g) ( West 2016))

BUnder

section

3. 5( a) of OMA ( 5 ILCS

I20/ 3. 5(

a) (

West 2016)),

a Request for Review " must

include a summary of the facts supporting the allegation."

9This office has previously determined that a public body violated the spirit and intent of OMA by.
maneuvering its members in and out of a private gathering in order to avoid having contemporaneous interactive
communications among a majority of a quorum. 111. Att' y Gen. PAC Req. Rev. Ltr. 14722, issued August 12, 2011,
at 5. The information you have presented does not indicate that the Board employed a similar scheme in violation of
the spirit or intent of OMA.

body. This office has previously determined that "[ t] his provision does not, however, require a
public body to hold public comment at any particular point in a meeting, provided that its rules
do not otherwise specify."
Ill. Att'y Gen. PAC Req. Rev. Ltr. 37876, issued March 31, 2016, at
3. Further, this office has previously determined that the right to comment during an open
meeting includes the right to ask questions of public officials, notwithstanding that OMA does
not require public officials to respond to questions or comments. See, for example, 111. Att'y Gen.
PAC Req. Rev. Ltr. 35858, issued October 20, 2015, at 2. Therefore, OMA did not require the
Board to provide an opportunity for members of the public to address or.question the Board
about the bid prior to its vote of approval.

Lastly, as to your allegation that the Board did not state the amount of the bid
2( e) of OMA ( 5 ILCS 120/ 2( e) ( West 2017 Supp.), as amended by
Public Act 100- 646, effective July 27, 2018) provides: " Final action shall be preceded by a
public recital of the nature of the matter being considered and other information that will inform
the public of the business being conducted."
In Board of Education ofSpringfield School
prior to

its

vote, section

District No. 186
2017),

Attorney General of Illinois, 2017 IL 120343, ¶ 64, 77 N. E. 3d 625, 636
the Illinois Supreme Court held that " under section 2( e) of the Open Meetings Act, a
v.

public recital must take place at the open meeting before the matter is voted upon; the recital
must announce the nature of the matter under consideration, with sufficient detail to identify the
particular transaction or issue, but need not provide an explanation of its terms or its
significance."

In this instance, to the extent that the Board did not publicly state the amount of

the bid prior to its vote of approval during its October 22, 2018, meeting, it does not appear that
reciting the amount of the bid was necessary to announce the nature of the matter under

consideration or identify the particular. transaction at issue. Accordingly, this office has
determined that no further action is warranted.

This determination is issued pursuant to section 3. 5( b) of the Open Meetings Act

Under the plain language of these provisions, if a public body's website is not maintained by full
time staff, the public body is not obligated to post meeting notices or minutes on its website.
On December 10, 2018, an Assistant Attorney General in the Public Access

Bureau spoke by telephone with the Village Clerk, Ms. Chris White, who confirmed that a part-

time staff member typically maintains the Village' s website. Therefore, the Board is not required
to post meeting notices or minutes on the Village's website for as long as that remains the case.
This office notes that the October 2018 meeting minutes are, nonetheless, posted on the Village' s
website.

alleging that the City of Bloomington ( City) Citizens Beautification Committee ( Committee)

the Open Meetings

Committee.

Section 2( a)

of

provides that "[

meetings of public bodies shall be open to the public unless excepted in subsection ( c) and

Section 2a." ( Emphasis

added.)

In order for the requirements of

OMA to apply, a gathering must constitute a " meeting" as defined by section 1. 02 of OMA:

video or audio conference,

as, without limitation, electronic mail, electronic chat, and instant

public body held for the purpose of discussing public business[.]
The Committee is comprised of twelve members. Accordingly, seven Committee
members constitute a quorum, and a majority of the quorum is four members. Therefore, when
at least four members of the Committee engage in contemporaneous, interactive communications

concerning Committee business, those discussions may constitute Committee meetings subject to
the procedural safeguards and requirements of OMA. The City explained that only two members •

of the Committee attended the April 23, 2012, gathering. Therefore, because a majority of a
quorum was not present at the April 23, 2012, gathering, this office is unable to conclude that

any discussion between these individuals constituted a " meeting" of the Committee subject to the
requirements

of OMA.

Your Request for Review does not allege that any members of

On July 24, 2017,-ubmitted this Request for Review alleging
that a majority of a quorum of Board members held improper meetings on July 15, 2017, and

July 18, 2017, because a quorum1 of Board members was not physically present at the meeting
location. Additionally, on July 28, 2017, the Board's legal counsel, Mr. Christopher L. Petrarca,
submitted a letter to the Public Access Bureau self-reporting these same alleged violations. Mr.
Petrarca con?rmed that three Board members, which constituted a majority of a quorum of
Board members, convened meetings to discuss public business on those two dates, and added
that it did the same on July 22, 2017.

On August 3, 2017, this of?ce sent a copy 0? Request for Review to
the Board and asked it to respond to her allegations, together cop1es of the notices, agendas,
and minutes for the meetings in question. On August 7, 2017, Mr. Petrarca furnished agendas
for the July 15, 2017, July 18, 2017, and July 22, 2017, meetings, and a written response
referencing his July 28, 2017, letter to this office. The information submitted indicated that

notice and an agenda were posted for each of these meetings, and the public had the opportunity
to attend and address the Board members who were present. _did not submit a reply

DETERMINATION

In order for the requirements of OMA to apply, a gathering must constitute a
"meeting" as de?ned by section 1.02 of OMA (5 ILCS 120/ 1 .02 (West 2016)):

"Meeting" means any gathering, whether in person or by
video or audio conference, telephone call, electronic means (such
as, without limitation, electronic mail, electronic chat, and instant
messaging), or other means of contemporaneous interactive
communication, of a majority of a quorum of the members of a
public body held for the purpose of discussing public business[.]
(Emphasis added.)

The ?rst sentence of the second paragraph of section 2.01 of OMA (5 ILCS 120/201 (West
2016)) further provides that quorum of members of a public body must be physically present
at the location of an open meeting." As detailed below, the remainder of this provision addresses
how a quorum is calculated for certain public bodies that hold meetings through interactive video
conferences, and the requirement that a quorum of other types of public bodies must be
physically present at the meeting location in order to allow additional members of those public

bodies to participate through audio or video conference.

Reading section 2. 01 in its entirety, it is

unclear whether the sentence requiring a quorum of members to be " physically present at the
location

meeting[ ]" is intended to apply to all meetings of public bodies, or only
those in which members participate by audio or video conferences. Therefore, the meaning of
of an open

that sentence is ambiguous.

In determining the meaning of a statute, a court will not read language in
isolation, but must consider it in the context of the entire statute." Slepicka v. Illinois Dept. of
Public Health, 2014 IL 116927, ¶ 14, 21 N. E. 3d 368, 373 ( 2014). When the meaning of statutory
language is ambiguous, a reviewing body may consider the statute' s purpose, the policy
considerations that led to its passage, and " the statute' s context, reading the provision at issue in
light of the entire section in which it appears and the Act of which that section is a part." In re
Marriage of Mathis, 2012 IL 113496, ¶ 20, 986 N.E. 2d 1139, 1144- 45 ( 2012).

The provision that "[ a] quorum of members of a public body must be physically
present at the location of an open meeting" was added to section 2. 01 of OMA by Public Act 941058, effective January 1, 2007. Prior to the passage of Public Act 94- 1058, the following

language constituted the entirety of section 2. 01 of OMA: " All meetings required by this Act
to be public shall be held at specified times and places which are convenient and open to

the public. No meeting required by this Act to be public shall be held on a legal holiday
the

day falls on that holiday." ( Emphasis added.) Public
added the following language to section 2. 01 as the second and third paragraphs:
unless

regular

meeting

A quorum of members of a public body must be physically
present at the location of an open meeting. If, however, an open
meeting of a public body ( except one with jurisdiction limited to a
specific geographic area that is less than statewide) is held

simultaneously at one of its offices and one or more other locations

in a public building, which may include other of its offices,
through an interactive video conference and the public body
provides public notice and public access as required under this Act

for all locations, then members physically present in those
locations

requirement that a quorum be physically present at the location of
all

count

towards

an open meeting shall not apply, however, to State advisory boards
or bodies that do not have authority to make binding
recommendations or determinations or to take any other
substantive

action.

A quorum of members of a public body that is not a public

body with statewide jurisdiction must be physically present at the
location of a closed meeting. Other members who are not

participate in the meeting by means of a video or audio conference.
Public Act 94- 1058

also added section

7 to OMA ( 5 ILCS 120/ 7 ( West 2006)).

Section 7 sets

forth the rules governing remote meetingattendance by members who are unable to be
physically present at the meeting location. Moreover, Public Act 94- 1058 expanded the

definition of "meeting" in section 1. 02 of OMA ( 5 ILCS 120/ 1. 02 ( West 2006)) to include
gatherings that occur " by video or audio conference, telephone call, electronic means ( such as,

without limitation, electronic mail, electronic chat, and instant messaging), or other means of
contemporaneous interactive communication[.]"

Accordingly, in the context of section 2. 01 of OMA and the statute as a whole, the
requirement that a quorum be physically present is tied to circumstances in which one or more

members participate in the meeting despite not being physically present at the meeting location.
The legislative history behind Public Act 94- 1058 provides further support for the

conclusion that the language "[ a] quorum, of members of a public body must be physically
present

at the

location

of an open

pertains to instances involving remote
participation. During the House debate on Senate Bill No. 585, which added that language to

OMA as part of Public Act 94- 1058, House sponsor Robert F. Flider explained the legislation as
follows:

What this legislation does is it updates [ OMA] and specifies rules
with regard to electronic communications. It expands the definition

of a' meeting to include the presence whether by telephone calls,
video or audio conference, or other electronic means. And it also

specifies that a quorum of members of a public body must be
physically present at an open meeting in the case of electronic

does not change whatsoever the quorum requirements of

Emphasis added.) Remarks of Rep. Flider, May 1,

Therefore, Representative Flider clarified that the requirement that a quorum be " physically

present" pertains

only to instances

participation.

In this instance, the Requests for Review solely asserted that the Board violated

section 2. 01 of OMA by holding meetings without having a quorum physically present, and the
Board has acknowledged that a majority of a quorum, not a full quorum, of Board members
gathered to discuss public business on those dates. Because there is no indication that Board
members participated in those meetings by audio or video conference, the requirement in section

2. 01 of OMA that a quorum of the members of the public body be " physically present" is
inapplicable here. In addition, the Board members complied with OMA's requirements for
advance notice and the opportunity for the public to attend when a majority of a quorum of a
public body gather to discuss public business. Accordingly, this office is unable to conclude that
the Board violated OMA in connection with the three meetings in question.
This determination, however, cannot be construed as approval of the Board' s
meetings conducted without a quorum of members of the public body present, nor does it address

the ability of just a majority of a quorum, as opposed to a full quorum, even to discuss issues.

Rather, this office' s determination is limited to interpreting the requirements of OMA. See 15

ILCS 205/ 7 et seq. ( West 2016). The quorum requirements for the Board are set by its formal
policies, the School Code, and rules of parliamentary procedure. Similarly, other public bodies
may formulate requirements with respect to quorum requirements and meeting attendance.
OMA is silent on quorum requirements except for the circumstances described above.
The Public Access Counselor had determined that resolution of these matters does

not require the issuance of a binding opinion. If you have any questions, please contact me at the
Springfield address on the first page of this letter. This letter serves to close these matters.

This determination is issued pursuant to section 3. 5( e) of the Open Meetings Act
e) ( West 2016)).
For the reasons discussed below, this office concludes

OMA) ( 5 ILCS 120/ 3. 5(

that the Littleton Township (Township) Board of Trustees ( Board) did not hold a meeting subject
to the requirements of OMA on July 18, 2018.
On September

15, 2018,

submitted this Request for Review

alleging that a quorum of the Board attended the Greater West Central Public Library District
Library) public meeting on July 18, 2018.

Request for Review stated that the

Library' s agenda for this meeting listed a discussion concerning an intergovernmental agreement
between the Township and the Library, and that during this meeting, the Township' s supervisor
indicated that she and the two other present Board members held a discussion about this matter
while traveling together to the Library' s meeting.

This office construed
Request for Review as alleging that the
discussion within the vehicle by certain Board members was subject to the requirements of OMA
because it constituted a " meeting" of the Board as defined in section 1. 02 of OMA ( 5 ILCS
120/ 1. 02 ( West 2016)).

public body held for the purpose of discussing public business or,
for a 5 -member public body, a quorum of the members of a
public body held for the purpose of discussing public business.
Accordingly, for a 5 -member public body, 3 members of
the body constitute a quorum and the affirmative vote of 3

members is necessary to adopt any motion, resolution, or
ordinance,

unless a greater number is otherwise

required.

Emphasis added.)

Here, the Board is a 5 - member public body comprised of the Township supervisor
and

four

trustees.

See 60 ILCS

statutory definition

of a "

1/ 80- 5( a) ( West

meeting,"

2016). Accordingly, under the above- cited

when at least three members of the Board engage in

contemporaneous, interactive communications concerning Township business, those discussions
may constitute Board meetings subject to the procedural safeguards and requirements of OMA.

violations concerning a July 9, 2018, Board meeting. These allegations, however, were not raised in

The Township clerk, however, is not a member of Board, and is entitled to cast a

vote in only one specific scenario which is not at issue in this matter. 2 See 60 ILCS I/ 80 -5( a)
West 2016) ("

The township clerk shall be the clerk of the township board but nota voting

member, except that in the case of a tie vote to fill a vacancy in a township office, the clerk shall
be entitled to cast one vote.").
Under these circumstances, a gathering of the Township
supervisor, the Township clerk, and one trustee of the Board does not constitute a quorum of the
Board. Therefore, this office is unable to conclude that any discussion between these three

individuals concerning Township business while traveling to the Library' s July 18, 2018,

meeting constituted a " meeting" of the Board subject to the requirements of OMA. 3
The Public Access Counselor has determined that resolution of this matter does

not require the issuance of a binding opinion. This letter serves to close this matter. if you have
any questions, you may contact me by mail at the Chicago address on the first page of this letter;

21n his reply,
questioned whether the Township clerk may attend the Board' s closed
session discussions if the clerk is not a member of the Board. The Public Access Bureau has previously determined
that OMA does not prohibit a public body from permitting non- members to attend closed session discussions. 111.
Att'y Gen. PAC Req. Rev. Ltr. 35792, issued June 22, 2015.

3This office' s review of the minutes of the Library' s July 18, 2018, meeting confirms that no
additional members of the Board attended and engaged in the discussion of Township business during this meeting
of the Library. However, this office reminds the members of Board to be mindful of the requirements of OMA even

when attending the public meeting of another public body. If a second trustee of the Board had attended the
Library' s meeting and engaged in deliberative discussions of Township business, those discussions potentially could
have

constituted

a

Board meeting.

Closed Session Discussion

As mentioned above,

Request for Review asserted that the Board

improperly discussed in closed session an intergovernmental agreement between the Board and

Library during the Board' s August 20, 2018, special meeting. The Board stated in its answer to
this office, however, that there was no closed session at that meeting. Specifically, the Board
stated:

In his Request for Review,

public body to maintain " a verbatim record of all their closed meetings in the form of an audio or video recording[,]"
no provision of OMA requires that a public body record its open session meetings, nor does OMA prohibit a
member of a public body from recording an open session meeting on his or her personal device. However, because

The minutes provided by the Board of its August 20, 2018, special meeting confirm this account.
Because the available information indicates that no closed session discussion

by discussing an unauthorized topic in closed session during its August 20, 2018, special
meeting.

Section 1. 05( b) of OMA provides the requirements for elected or appointed

The failure of one or more members of a public• body to

validity of an action taken by the public body.
An elected or appointed member of a public body subject to
this Act who has successfully completed the training required
under this subsection ( b) and filed a copy of the certificate of
completion with the public body is not required to subsequently
complete the training required under this subsection ( b).

In his Request for Review,
alleged that the Township' ssupervisor and Board Trustees
Rebman and Woodside failed to complete their OMA training within 90 days of taking their
oaths of office

being

appointed.

The Board does

not

dispute

those

allegations.

 Mr. John M. Redlingshafer
December 14, 2018

Therefore, this office concludes that the Township' s supervisor and Trustees

Rebman and Woodside failed to comply with the training requirements of OMA. 4
However, along with his Request for Review,
furnished this office
with copies of the certificates of completion reflecting that all of these individuals have now
successfully completed the OMA electronic training. Therefore, because the supervisor and

trustees in question have now successfully completed the OMA electronic training and because
the plain language of section 1. 05( b) provides that any violation of the training requirements
does not invalidate any action taken by the Board, no further remedial action is required.
However, this office cautions the Board members to comply with all of the training requirements
of OMA in the future.

The Public Access Counselor has determined that resolution of this matter does

not require the issuance of a binding opinion. This letter serves to close this matter. If you have
any questions, you may contact me by mail at the Chicago address on the first page of this letter,

also alleged that the Township clerk failed to take the OMA training within 90 days of

being elected. This office determined in a separate Request for Review submitted by

that the Township .

clerk is not a member of the Board. See 111. Att' y Gen. PAC Req. Rev. Ltr. 54879, issued December 11, 2018, at 3:
Accordingly, the clerk is not subject to the training requirements of section 1. 05( b) of OMA. However, if the clerk

is the Board' s OMA designee, then he is subject to the annual training requirements of section 1. 05( a) of OMA ( 5
ILCS

120/ 1. 05( a) ( West 2016)),

which provides:

Every public body shall designate employees, officers, or members to receive
training on compliance with this Act. Each public body shall submit a list of
designated employees, officers, or members to the Public Access Counselor.

Within 6 months after the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 96th
General Assembly, the designated employees, officers, and members must
successfully complete an electronic training curriculum, developed and

administered by the Public Access Counselor, and thereafter must successfully
complete an annual training program. Thereafter, whenever a public body

designates an additional employee, officer, or member to receive this training,
that person must successfully complete the electronic training curriculum within
30 days

after

that

designation.

County's website 48 hours before the meeting and that the agenda was not continuously available
for public review at the location of the meeting because the building in which the agenda was .
posted was locked.

Section 2. 02( a)

On January 8, 2015, this office forwarded a copy of the Request for Review to the
Board and asked it to respond to
allegations. On January 29, 2015, counsel for the
Board responded by providing an affidavit of the Assistant Director of Information Technology

and Webmaster for the County that stated the agenda for the December 29, 2014, meeting was

posted on the County' s website on December 26, 2014. The affidavit also included a document
indicating

the precise

time that the

agenda

had been

posted

on

that date.

In its reply, the Board

stated that the agenda was also physically posted at the Criminal Justice building and the LaSalle

County Governmental Complex. The Board stated that in the future it would post agendas on the
outside doors of the buildings.

Because the Board has provided documentation showing that the agenda for the

December 29, 2014, meeting was posted on the County' s website and at the location of the
meeting at least 48 hours before the meeting and because section 2. 02( c) states that posting of
the agenda on the public body' s website satisfies the continuous posting requirement in OMA,
this office concludes that the Board did not violate sections 2. 02( a) and 2. 02( c) of OMA.

RE:

OMA Request for Review —2018 PAC 55892

Dear
The Public Access Bureau has received your Request for Review, dated

November 27, 2018, in which you allege that the Frankfort Community Unit School District No.
168 ( School District)
ILCS 1

Board

of

Education ( Board)

violated

the Open Meetings

Act ( OMA) ( 5

seg. ( West 2016)).

Specifically, you allege that the Board failed to post notice of a
special meeting concerning the release of student records. Our review of the information you
et

have furnished, however, provides no basis for this office to conclude that the Board has violated

OMA in connection with any particular meeting.
Section 3. 5( a) of OMA provides, in pertinent part:

A person who believes that a violation of this Act by a

public body has occurred may file a request for review with the
Public Access Counselor established in the Office of the Attorney
General nol later than 60 days after the alleged violation. If facts

concerning the violation are not discovered within the 60—day •

period, but are discovered at a later date, not exceeding 2 years'
after the alleged violation, by a person utilizing reasonable
diligence, the request for review may be made within 60 days of
the discovery of the alleged violation. The request for review must
be in writing, must be signed by the requester, and must include a
summary

of

the facts supporting

the allegation. (

Emphasis

Under the plain language of section 3. 5( a) of OMA, a Request for Review must

set forth facts supporting the allegation of a potential violation of OMA in order to be subject to

review by this office. In this instance, your Request for Review appears to allege that the Board
failed to post notice of a special meeting to review complaints relating to the unauthorized

release of student records, but you did not identify when that meeting occurred or how you
determined that notice was not provided in accordance with the. requirements of section 2. 02 of
OMA ( 5 1LCS 120/ 2. 02 ( West 2016)).

Accordingly, your Request for Review does not allege
sufficient facts for this office to review the allegation that the Board failed to properly post notice
for an unspecified special meeting. if the meeting in question has occurred within the 60 -day
timeframe described by section 3. 5( a) of OMA, or if you did. not discover facts concerning the
alleged violation within that time frame despite using reasonable diligence, you may wish to
submit a new Request for Review raising specific allegations concerning that particular meeting
and providing facts supporting those allegations.

Your November 27, 2018, Request for Review also included complaints
concerning the alleged unauthorized release of student records and various requests for School
District records. To the extent that you intended for the Public Access Counselor to review those

additional complaints, this office notes that pursuant to section 7( c)( 3) of the Attorney General

Dear Mr. Meyers and Mr. Kmett:

Meeting Notice
With respect to Mr. Meyers' allegations other than his claim that members of the

Council had not completed the OMA electronic training curriculum, section 3. 5( a) of OMA (5
ILCS 120/ 3. 5(

a) (

West. 2016))

provides:

A person who believes that a violation of this Act by a
public body has occurred may file a request for review with the
Public Access Counselor established in the Office of the Attorney
General not later than 60 days after the alleged violation. If facts

concerning the violation are not discovered within the 60 -day
period, but are discovered at a later date, not exceeding 2 years
after the alleged violation, by a person utilizing reasonable

diligence, the request for review may be made within 60 days

of the discovery of the alleged violation. The request for review
must be in writing, must be signed by the requester, and must
include a summary of the facts supporting the allegation.
Emphasis added.)

Section 2. 02( a)

of

OMA ( 5 ILCS 120/ 2. 02(

a) (

West 2016)) generally requires a

public body to post notice of any regular or special meeting at least 48 hours in advance of the
start of the meeting. Accordingly, this office determined that no further action was warranted as
to Mr. Meyers' allegation that the Council had provided three or more business days' notice for
the meetings held within. the 60 days prior to the submission of his Request for Review.

Mr. Meyers replied to that decision by arguing:
I] n accordance

with (

5 ILCS 120/ 2. 02), the [ Council] has not nor

sic] ever prepared or made available a schedule of all its 'regular

meetings at the beginning of any calendar of fiscal year, much less
calendar years 2017 or 2018 or Illinois State fiscal years 2016- 17,

2017- 18, a violation of OMA and nullifying any claim to 48 hours'
notice.

Thereby, and in accordance with ( 5 ILCS 120/ 2. 03),
announcements of regular meeting dates require at least ten ( 10)
days'

notice;

and

in the area in which such body functions ( i. e., the State of Illinois,

2015 Pop. 12, 859, 995). 12)
Mr. Meyers claimed that the Council violated OMA in connection with its May 15, 2018, June
20, 2018, June 28, 2018, and July 16, 2018, meetings by not providing at least 10 days' notice.
Section 2. 02( a)

OMA

provides that "[

Section 2. 03 of OMA ( 5 ILCS

i)n addition to the notice required by Section 2. 02,

each body subject to this Act must, at the beginning of each calendar or fiscal year, prepare and
make available a schedule of all its regular meetings for such calendar or fiscal year, listing the
times and places of such meetings."
In construing these provisions, the Public Access Bureau
has previously determined:
Under the plain language of these provisions, a public body
that meets regularly and has scheduled regular meetings for the
year must make its regular meetings schedule available to the

public. In contrast, a public body that does not hold regularly scheduled meetings is not required to produce an annual regular

meeting schedule, as the rationale of providing transparency to the

public about the plans a public body has made to meet in the future
is inapplicable when the public body does not meet at regular
intervals and has not yet decided when it will meet throughout the

year. Compare Ill. Att'y Gen. PAC Req. Rev. Ltr. 26850, issued
July 27, 2015, at 5 ("[ I] f the meetings of a committee of the Board
are set in advance at routine intervals throughout the year, the

meetings[.]"),

Ill. Att'y Gen. PAC Req. Rev. Ltr. 49458, issued

September

13, 2017, at 1- 2.

On September 17, 2018, an Assistant Attorney General in the Public Access
Bureau telephoned a Board attorney who advises the Council to verify whether the Council holds
regular meetings throughout

the year, or instead meets on an ad hoc basis.

The Council' s

attorney confirmed that the Council is not the type of public body that holds regularly -scheduled
meetings. Instead, it primarily holds meetings every three years around the time when the
Illinois Energy Conservation Code3 is being updated. This office has not received any
information to the contrary. Rather, Mr. Meyers referenced " the somewhat ' regular' meetings

convened every three years, i4 and provided a list of Council meetings held since February 15,
2012, which evinces that the Council does not hold meetings at regular intervals throughout

the

year. Therefore, the following language from section 2. 03 of OMA is inapplicable to the
intermittent Council

meetings

that are

within

the scope

of

this Request for Review: " If a change

is made in regular meeting dates, at least 10 days' notice of such change shall be given by
publication
in a newspaper of general circulation in the area in which such body functions."

The

Public Access Bureau has consistently determined that this ten- day notice requirement applies

only when a public body is changing its regular meeting dates going forward (i.e. from the first
Monday

of each

month

to the first

Tuesday of

each

month),

rather than when a single ( special)

meeting is scheduled or rescheduled. See e.g., I11. Att'y Gen. PAC Req. Rev. Ltr. 21021, issued
March 11, 2013 ( public body not required to provide 10 days' notice by publication for a.special
meeting).

Mr. Meyers' claim that the Council was required to provide at least 10 days' advance

notice of its May 15, 2018, June 20, 2018, June 28, 2018, and July 16, 2018, meetings is
unsupported by the language of OMA and thus unavailing.
As to the meetings from more than 60 days before Mr. Meyers submitted his

Request for Review, Mr. Meyers argued that he had not discovered those alleged instances of

insufficient notice within 60 days after they occurred despite utilizing reasonable diligence; he
stated that he had discovered those alleged deficiencies " upon reviewing the history of Council

meetings. 5 However, he provided no information supporting the assertion that he utilized
reasonable diligence in connection with those claims, such as checking for the posting of

agendas around the times that those meetings were held. Therefore, his allegations concerning
371 111. Adm. Code § 600. 100 et seq. ( 2018), last amended at 40111. Reg. 2754, effective January
20, 2016.

those meetings are untimely, and this office lacks the authority to review them under section
3. 5( a) of OMA.

Convenience of the July 16, 2018, Meeting Date
Section

2. 01

of

OMA ( 5 ILCS 120/ 2. 01 ( West 2016)) provides,

in relevant part:

All meetings required by this Act to be public shall be held at specified times and places which
are

convenient

and open

to the

public."

OMA does

not

define

what

is " convenient."

Undefined

statutory terms must be given their plain and ordinary meaning. Exelon Corp. v. Dept of

word, a court may use a dictionary to determine the word' s plain and ordinary meaning).

Dist. 2003) ( quoting Merriam -Webster' s Collegiate

meeting time was convenient, the term " convenient" in section 2. 01 modifies both " times" and
places." "

Open"

and "

convenient"

are not synonymous

under

the Act; accordingly, "[ a] meeting

can be open in the sense that no one is prohibited from attending it, but it can be held in such an
ill-suited, unaccommodating, unadvantageous place that members of the public, as a practical
matter, would
be deterred from attending it." Gerwin, 345 Ill. App. 3d at 361. To the same
extent, a meeting can be held at such an unaccommodating, unadvantageous time that the public

would be unreasonably deterred from attending it. The concept of public convenience implies a
rule of reasonableness,

not ' absolute

accessibility'

but ' reasonable

accessibility."'

Gerwin,

III. App. 3d at 362 ( quoting State ex rel. Badke v. Village Board of the Village of Greendale, 173
Wis. 2d 553, 579, 494 N. W. 2d 408, 418 ( Wis. 1993)).

Mr. Meyers alleged that the July 16, 2018, meeting was not scheduled for a
convenient time because " several, if not many, of the parties identified on the [ Board' s] e- mail

meeting announcement would be" attending a conference on energy codes in Texas from July 15,
2018, through July 17, 2018. 6 Although the information Mr. Meyers provided to this office
suggests that the July 16, 2018, meeting time was inconvenient for at least some individuals who
wished to attend, the e- mails Mr. Meyers provided to this office do not indicate that the timing of

the meeting was unreasonable for the public in general. The meeting was scheduled for 10: 00
a. m. to noon on a Monday, which was a business day. This office has previously determined that
a meeting at 10: 00 a. m. on a business day was not held at an unreasonable time. 111. Att' y Gen.

OMA Training
Section 1. 05( b)

of

OMA ( 5 ILCS 120/ 1. 05( b) ( West 2016)) sets forth the

requirements for members of public bodies to complete the electronic training program

developed by the Public Access Counselor:
Except as otherwise provided in this Section, each elected

or appointed member of a public body subject to this Act who
becomes such a member after the effective date of this amendatory

Act of the 97th General Assembly shall successfully complete the

electronic training curriculum developed and administered by the
Public Access Counselor. For these members, the training must be
completed not later than the 90th day after the date the member:

Accordingly, the Council failed to complete the OMA electronic training requirement in a timely
manner. By its plan language, however, section 1. 05 of OMA does not invalidate any Council
actions taken before all of the members had completed the training. This office cautions. the

Council to ensure that in the future, any new members who have not previously completed the

OMA electronic training curriculum as a member of any other public body complete the
curriculum within 90 days after taking the oath of office or, if no oath is required, otherwise
assuming the responsibilities of a member of the Council.
The Public Access Counselor has determined that resolution of this matter does

not require the issuance of a binding opinion. This letter serves to close this matter. If you have

On November

e) (

letter is issued pursuant to section 3. 5( e) of the Open Meetings
West 2016)).

19, 2012, this office received

Request for

Review alleging that the Schuyler -Industry Community Unit School District No. 5 ( School
District) Board of Education ( Board) violated the requirements of OMA by: (
1) taking final
action during its September
19, 2012, meeting on certain items that were not on the agenda; ( 2)
holding special meetings on September 24, 2012, and October 9, 2012, to address payables and

supporting the allegation that the Board violated OMA; he did not identify any deficiencies with
the September 24, 2012, and October 9, 2012, special meetings, and a public body does not
violate OMA by correcting draft minutes within the 48 hours prior to a meeting. Accordingly,
this office took no further action with respect to those claims.

As to the remaining allegations, this office forwarded a copy of
Request for Review to the Board on January 18, 2013, and asked it to provide this office with
copies of the September 19, 2012, meeting agenda and minutes, together with a response to the

allegations. On January 28, 2013, this office received a written response from then -School
District Superintendent,

Mr. R. Mathew Plater, on behalf of the Board.

This office also received

copies of the Board' s agendas and minutes from its September 19, 2012, September 24, 2012,

and December 19, 2012, meetings. On January 30, 2013, this office forwarded a copy of the

meeting." Section 2. 02(

Mr. Plater

acknowledged

that "[

accounts."

However, he asserted

that the omissions were inadvertent, and that the Board subsequently took measures to remedy
them.

Mr. Plater explained that the Board had decided to eliminate the use of a consent agenda,

which normally contained those items, after using such a process for many years. He stated that

the Board did not notice the missing action items prior to mailing out the agenda. According to
Mr. Slater, the Board was uncertain how to handle the situation at the meeting in question. Mr.
Slater stated that the Board proceeded with action on the items but then later decided to hold a

special meeting on September 24, 2012, to reapprove the bills; he stated that notice of that
special meeting was properly posted. With regard to the Board' s August meeting minutes, Mr.

Plater stated that the Board was unable to approve the minutes in September due to scheduling

conflicts, and that approval of the minutes was mistakenly left off of the Board' s October

meeting agenda, while no regular meeting was held in November. Nonetheless, he noted:
The August minutes although not officially approved were
posted to the district website in late August for the public to view.

It is our practice to share the minutes on our website as soon as

they are typed in an attempt to keep them informed. If the minutes
are amend or changed at subsequent meetings the corrected
131
minutes are reposted

to the website.

Mr. Plater stated that the August meeting minutes were approved at the Board' s December

regular meeting and provided this office with copies of the agenda and minutes of that December
meeting.

In this matter, the Board acknowledged

that it took action on certain items at its

September 19, 2012, meeting that were not set forth in the agenda, and that it did not approve the
minutes of its August regular meeting until after its second subsequent regular meeting had
occurred.

Accordingly,

the Board

violated

sections

2. 02(

c) and

2. 06( b)

of

OMA. Because the

Board appears to have held a properly -noticed special meeting on September 24, 2012, to re -vote
on the items omitted from the September 19, 2012, meeting agenda, and because the Board
subsequently approved the August 22, 2012, meeting minutes, this office has determined that no
further remedial action is required . under these circumstances.

The Public Access Counselor has determined that the resolution of this matter
does

not require the

issuance

of a

binding opinion.

RE:. OMA Requests for Review -- 2015 PAC 36413; 2015 PAC 36585'

Dear

and Ms, Kiger:

This determination. letter is issued pursuant to section 3. 5( e) of the Open Meetings
Act ( OMA) ( 5 ILCS 120/ 3. 5(

e) (

West 2016)).

For the reasons that follow,

allegations that the Clark County Park District Board of Trustees ( Board) and its Architectural

Control Committee ( Committee) violated OMA on July 11, 2015, are undisputed.

On July 18, 2015, this office received

s Request for Review alleging

that the Committee did not provide proper notice of its July 11, 2015, meeting.
also
alleged that the Board violated OMA during the July 11, 2015, meeting because a majority of a
quorum of Board members were in attendance and discussed matters of public business that were

outside the scope of the Committee' s purview. On August 3, 2015, this office sent a copy of the
Request for Review to the Board and asked it to provide a detailed written response to

allegations, together with copies of the notice, agenda, and minutes for the alleged July •
11, 2015, meeting. The Board did not respond. On July 7, 2016, this office again sent a copy of

DETERMINATION

The Open Meetings Act provides that public agencies exist to aid in the conduct

of the people' s business, and that the intent" of the Act is to assure that agency actions be taken
openly

that their

deliberations

be

171 ( 5th Dist. 1989).

Section 2( a)

of

OMA ( 5 ILCS 120/ 2( a) ( West 2014))

provides that "[

a] Il meetings

of public bodies shall be open to the public unless excepted in subsection ( c) and closed in
accordance with

Section 2a."

Section 1. 02

of

OMA ( 5 ILCS 120/ 1. 02 ( West 2014)) defines a

meeting" as:

A] ny gathering, whether in person or by video or audio
conference,

telephone

call, electronic

means ( such as, without

limitation, electronic mail, electronic chat, and instant messaging),
or other means of contemporaneous interactive communication, of

a majority of a quorum of the members of a public body held for

the purpose of discussing public business or, for a 5 -member
public body, a quorum of the members of a public body held for
the purpose of discussing public business.

The requirements of OMA are not automatically triggered merely because a
majority of a quorum attends a gathering. See University Professionals of Illinois v. Stukel, 344
111. App. 3d 856, 868 ( 1st Dist. 2003) ( OMA is not " triggered every time public officials meet
and

converse").

In determining whether a gathering of a majority of a quorum of the members of

21n a December 10, 2018, telephone conversation with an AAG in the Public Access Bureau, Ms:
Kiger acknowledged that the July 11, 2015, Campers Committee meeting was not at issue in these matters. Rather,

Ms. Kiger asserted that the agendas provided were the only meeting records she could locate for the entirety of the
relevant

time period.

Therefore, it generally would not constitute a Board meeting for Board
members to sit in on a Committee meeting, but discussion of non -Committee public business by

of [

a majority of a quorum of the Board during a Committee meeting could qualify as a Board
meeting.
Furthermore,

section

2. 02(

a) of

OMA ( 5 ILCS 120/ 2. 02(

a) (

West 2014))

provides, in pertinent part:

An agenda for each regular meeting shall be posted at the
principal office of the public body and at the location where the

meeting is to be held at least 48 hours in advance of the holding of
the meeting. A public body that has a website that the full- time
staff of the public body maintains shall also post on its website the
agenda of any regular meetings of the governing body of that

public body. Any agenda of a regular meeting that is posted on a
public body' s website shall remain posted on the website until the
regular meeting is concluded.
In

addition,

section

2. 06(

a)

of

OMA ( 5 ILCS 120/ 2. 06( a) ( West 2014)) requires all public bodies

to keep written minutes of all their meetings.

Neither the Board nor the Committee responded to this office' s inquiry letters in
2015 and 2016. Thus, neither public body provided information from which this office could

evaluate the validity of
claims in a timely manner. Recently, the Park District' s
current FOIA officer explained to this office that she was unable to locate any information
pertaining to the Committee referenced in

Requests for Review, in which he alleged

t] he Architectural Control Committee was appointed for the specific stated purpose of
reviewing documents in relation to ' leased lots' [ a map of these leased lots is located at the park

that "[

district main office] that the Park District is attempting to lease to private individuals." 3 This
office' s review of the July 11, 2015, Campers Committee meeting agenda, however, revealed that

notice appears to have been provided of that committee' s discussion of property leases for

adjacent homeowners, as well as the review of a draft lease. While those agenda items appear to

pertain to
allegations, suggesting that the applicable public body wasinstead the
Campers Committee, the failure by any representative of the Park District to answer this office' s

inquiries has hampered our ability to fully review this matter. This office has received no
information as to where and when notice was posted of the July 11, 2015, meeting, or the extent'
to which a majority of a quorum of the Board deliberated or acted upon Board business.
Accordingly,
allegations that the Board and the Committee violated the

requirements of OMA in connection with the July 11, 2015, meeting are undisputed.
This office reminds the Board conduct both its regular meetings and committee

meetings in full compliance with OMA. Specifically, the Board and its committees should

provide at least 48 hours' advance notice of all future meetings. When a majority of a quorum of
the Board wishes to discuss a matter of public business that is not within the scope of a

committee' s purview during a meeting of that committee, the Board should give notice that it
will be meeting alongside that committee. The Board and its committees should also keep
written minutes of all of their meetings.

The Public Access Counselor has determined that resolution of this matter does

not require the issuance of a binding opinion. This letter serves to close these files. If you have
any questions, please contact me at ( 217) 785- 7438 or at the Springfield address on the first page

RE:

OMA Request for Review —2018 PAC 56066

Dear

This determination is issued. pursuant to section 3. 5( b) of the Open Meetings Act
OMA) ( 5 ILCS 120/ 3. 5( b) ( West 2016)).

For the reasons set forth below, the information

Trustees ( Board) of the Bradford Community Fire Protection District ( District) violated OMA in
connection

with its November

Section 3. 5(

In your Request for Review, you stated that no trustees showed up for the Board' s
scheduled November 18, 2018, monthly meeting, and that notice of the cancellation was neither
posted at the meeting location to inform the public nor provided to the press. You also stated

that the Board had held a special meeting on December 6, 2018, involving Mr. James Reisner,
the Chief Executive Officer and owner of The Ambulance Service.

You stated that the Board

signed a contract during the meeting to replace the Bradford Rescue Squad with The Ambulance

that no bidding was publicized for this contract, and you expressed concern about how the
change will affect response

times.

As an initial matter, the Public Access Counselor' s authority to resolve disputes is
limited to
et

alleged

of OMA and the Freedom of Information
Act ( FOIA) ( 5 ILCS 140/ 1
See 15 ILCS 205/ 7( c)( 3) ( West 2016).
OMA concerns the transparency

violations

seq. ( West 2016)).

with which public bodies meet and conduct public business; it does not govern how or when

contracts are bid out or what form of ambulance service is provided for an area. Accordingly,
the Public Access Bureau does not have the authority to review those issues.

With respect to the apparent cancellation of the November 18, 2018, meeting,
although the information you provided indicates that members of the public would have

benefited from being notified of the cancellation rather than finding out by showing up at the
closed fire house, OMA does not specify any steps that a public body must take to cancel a

meeting. Therefore, the Public Access Bureau has consistently determined that a public body

does not violate OMA by not providing written notice of the cancellation of a meeting. See, for
example, I11. Att' y Gen. PAC Req. Rev. Ltr. 26009, issued January 24, 2013, at 3.
Turning to the December 6, 2018, special meeting, you claimed that the press was
not apprised of action taken at the meeting to replace the Bradford Rescue Squad. Section
2. 02( b)

of

OMA ( 5 ILCS 120/ 2. 02( b) ( West 2016)) provides, in relevant part:

The body shall supply copies of the notice of its regular meetings,
and of the notice of any special, emergency, rescheduled or •
reconvened meeting, to any news medium that has filed an annual

request for such notice. Any such news medium shall also be given
the same notice of all special, emergency, rescheduled or
reconvened meetings in the same manner as is given to members

of the body provided such news medium has given the public body
an address or telephone number within the territorial jurisdiction of

the public body at which such notice may be given.

Although this provision requires a public body to provide any news medium that has filed an

annual request with notice of its special meetings, your Request for Review did not set forth any
facts indicating that the Board failed to provide such a news medium with notice. Section

2.02(b) does not require a public body to inform the press after a meeting of action taken during
the meeting. Absent facts supporting the allegation that the Board violated OMA in connection

with its November 18, 2018, and December 6, 2018, meetings, this office has determined that no
further action is warranted in this particular Request for Review. If you are able to provide facts
supporting the allegation that the Board failed to provide notice of the December 6, 2018,
meeting to

a news

medium

that

had

requested

such notice,

RE:

OMA Request for Review —2018 PAC 56195

Dear Ms. Benford:

This determination letter is issued pursuant to section 3. 5( b) of the Open Meetings
Act ( OMA) ( 5 ILCS 120/ 3. 5( b) ( West 2016)).

For the reasons set forth below, the Public

Access Bureau concludes that no further action in this matter is warranted.
In your Request for Review, received December 20, 2018, you claimed that the
Public Participation

Ordinance

by the DuPage Township Board ( Board), over your
dissenting vote as a member of the Board, contains language that violates OMA. You asserted
that the Public Access Bureau has previously determined that similar language in the Wesley
adopted

Township Board's public comment rules violated OMA, citing I11. Att'y Gen. PAC Req. Rev. Ltr.

that "[ a] ny

by the public body." A public body violates section 2. 06( g) of OMA when it: ( 1)
prohibits a member of the public from addressing its members in a manner inconsistent with its
established and recorded rules, or ( 2) prohibits a member of the public from providing public
comment pursuant to its established and recorded rules but those rules unreasonably restrict that
person' s right to address public officials.

Your Request for Review asked this office to evaluate' the propriety of the Board' s
public comment rules absent a specific complaint that the Board enforced those rules to

improperly prevent a member of the public from addressing public officials at a meeting. In
contrast, the determination you referenced regarding the Wesley Township Board examined
specific instances in which particular members of the public were restricted from addressing the

members of that public body during a particular meeting. Because your Request for Review did
not allege that any member of the public was improperly prohibited from addressing the Board,
you have not provided facts supporting the allegation that the Board violated section 2. 06( g) of
OMA. Accordingly, this office will take no further action in this matter.

notes that " the primary purpose of adopting rules governing public comment pursuant to section

2. 06( g) of OMA is to accommodate the speaker' s statutory right to address the public body,

ensuring that the public body can maintain order and decorum at public meetings." Ill.
Att' y Gen. Pub. Acc. Op. No. 14- 012, issued September 30, 2014, at 6. As such, this office has
previously determined that the right to public comment includes the right to address individual

members of a public body. See I11. Att' y Gen. PAC Req. Rev. Ltr. 50824, issued July 10, 2018,
at 5- 6._ This. office therefore suggests that the Board review and revise its rule requiring members
of the public to direct comments to the presiding officer, unless specifically permitted to address
other Board members or officers, to ensure that it upholds the public' s right to address all public
officials.

Dear
Pursuant to

3. 5(

section

a) of the

Open Meetings Act ( OMA) ( 5 ILCS 120/ 3. 5( a)

West 2016),

the Public Access Bureau has received your Request for Review alleging a possible
violation of OMA by the Board of Education ( Board) of Chicago Ridge School District 127. 5
District).

Our review of the information

you have furnished, however, provides no basis for the

Public Access Counselor to conclude that the Board violated OMA.
Section 3. 5(

a) of

OMA

provides

that "[

a] person who believes that a violation of

OMA ( 5 ILCS 120/ 2. 06( g) ( West 2016))

provides that "[

a] ny

person shall be permitted an opportunity to address public officials under the rules established
by the public body." The Attorney General has previously concluded that section 2. 06( g) of OMA " requires that all public bodies subject to the Act provide an opportunity for

of the public
to address public officials at open meetings."
111. Att'y Gen. Pub. Acc.

Your Request for Review alleges that the District superintendent denied' your

request to address the Board during a closed session. As such, you have not provided a summary

of facts from which' we could determine that the Board violated OMA by enforcing its rules to
prohibit you or any other members of the public from exercising their statutory right to address
during an open meeting. No provision of OMA requires a public body to enter closed

Although you also stated

that you believe the District superintendent attempted to impede your access to the open meeting,
you acknowledged that he informed you that you did not require his permission to attend the

meeting. To the extent that you object to restrictions to your access to school property for other
purposes, those restrictions are not governed by OMA.
Because the facts you have alleged do not indicate that the Board violated the
requirements

of OMA, this office has determined

that no further action is warranted

The Board has expressly denied that it prohibited
from speaking
because he did not signthe sign- up sheet that it uses to facilitate public comment. Although the
Board president referred to
not signing the sign- up sheet when he denied his request
to speak after the Board moved on to the next agenda item, there is insufficient evidence for this

office to conclude the prohibition was based on the sign- up sheet rather than its rule that limits
public comment to the designated public comment portion of the meeting. Such a rule is content

neutral and promotes efficiency and decorum by preventing interruptions. See I11. Att'y Gen.

Req. Rev. Ltr. 42969, issued May 25, 2017 ( a public body that provides an opportunity for the
public to speak at the time provided for in its established and recorded rules is not required to

provide additional opportunities for public comment during other parts of a meeting).

Accordingly, this office concludes that the Board' s rule is permissible section 2. 06( g) of OMA.
If the Board had ended the public comment portion of the meeting and

transitioned to the next agenda item so abruptly that members of the public did not have a
meaningful opportunity to invoke their right to speak, the Board could have violated section
2. 06( g) of OMA. In light of the parties' conflicting accounts, however, this office is unable to
determine that the Board did so. It is unclear precisely when
determined that he
wished to speak and whether he had an adequate opportunity to express that intent before the
Board moved on to the next agenda item. Accordingly, this office is unable to conclude that the
Board violated OMA by prohibiting
from addressing the Board after the public

comment portion of the meeting ended. Nevertheless, because it appears that there may have
been confusion concerning the timing of the public comment portion of the meeting, this office

recommends that the Board clearly communicate its intent to conclude public comment before

moving on to the next agenda item to ensure that members of the public have an adequate
opportunity to invoke their statutory right to address the Board.

Dear Ms. Benjamin:

This determination letter is issued pursuant to section 3. 5( e) of the Open Meetings
Act ( OMA) ( 5 ILCS 120/ 3. 5(

e) (

West 2016)).

On June 24, 2016, you submitted a Request for Review to the Public Access

Bureau alleging that the City of Bloomington Liquor Commission ( Commission) improperly
deliberated about public business in private. On July 18, 2016, this office sent a copy of the
Request for Review to Mayor Tari Renner but did not hear back. This office also has not heard
from you about this matter since your submission.

In the interim, however, the Public Access Bureau determined

that the

Commission is not a public body subject to OMA, as it " is not an advisory or subsidiary body of
a public

body such as the City Council which is subject to the requirements of OMA." I11. Att'y.
Req. Rev. Ltr. 43179, issued February 16, 2017, at3. ( Copy of determination

Because the Commission' s deliberations are not subject to OMA, the Commission did

not violate OMA with respect to the deliberations at issue in your Request for Review.'
The Public Access Counselor has determined that resolution of this matter does

not require the issuance of a binding opinion. This file is closed.

Your Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA) complaint regarding the communications at issue was

For the reasons discussed below, this office

OMA) ( 5 ILCS 120/ 3. 5(

concludes that the Bloomington Liquor Commission ( Commission) did not hold a meeting
subject to the requirements of OMA on June 21, 2016.

On July 26, 2016,
submitted this Request for Review alleging
that the Commission violated the requirements of OMA on September 21, 2016, by holding a
special meeting and taking action without a quorum of its members physically present. 1

Specifically, Mr. Reimer alleged that only Commissioner Tari Renner, who also serves as the
Mayor of Bloomington, attended and, conducted Commission business. On August 5, 2016, this
office sent a copy of the Request for Review to the Commission and asked for a written response

to the allegations therein, together with copies of the notice, agenda, and minutes for the June 21,
2016, special meeting.
Section 2. 01 of OMA ( 5 ILCS 120/ 2. 01 ( West 2014)) requires a quorum of the members of a

apply, a gathering must constitute a " meeting" as defined by section 1. 02 of OMA ( 5 ILCS
120/ 1. 02 ( West 2014)):

Meeting" means any gathering, whether in person or by
video or audio conference, telephone call, electronic means ( such

as, without limitation, electronic mail, electronic chat, and instant
messaging), or other means of contemporaneous interactive

communication, of a majority of a quorum of the members of a

public body held for the purpose of discussing public business[.]
Emphasis added.)

The Commission is comprised of Mayor Renner and two other commissioners.
Counsel for the Commission, in his response to this office, questions whether the Commission
qualifies as a " public body" subject to OMA. Section 1. 02 of OMA ( 5 ILCS 120/ 1. 02 ( West
2014)) defines the term as follows:

Public body" includes all legislative, executive,
administrative or advisory, bodies of the State, counties, townships,

cities, villages, incorporated towns, school districts and all other
municipal corporations, boards, bureaus, committees or

commissions of this State, and any subsidiary bodies of any of the
foregoing including but not limited to committees and. ....
subcommittees which,are. supported in whole or in part by tax
revenue, or which expend tax revenue, except the General

Assembly and committees or commissionsthereof. " Public body"
includes tourism boards and convention or civic center boards
located in counties that are contiguous to the Mississippi River
with populations of more than 250, 000 but less than 300, 000.

Public body" includes the Health Facilities and Services Review
Board. " Public

Illinois Independent Tax Tribunal.

The City' s website states that the Commission is an " advisory Board to the Mayor
and City Council. Members of the Commission are appointed by the liquor commissioner

Mayor)."2 The Commission's response to this office, however, asserted that the Liquor

Commission is separate and distinct from the City Council and that it merely assists the Mayor in
exercising powers that he is authorized to take independently. In particular, section 4- 2 of the
Liquor Control Act of 1934 ( 235 ILCS5/ 4- 2 ( West 2014)) provides, in pertinent part:

The mayor or president of the board of trustees of each city, village
or incorporated town or his or her designee, and the president or
chairman of the county board or his or her designee, shall be the
local liquor control commissioner for their respective cities
villages, incorporated towns and counties, and shall be charged
with the administration in their respective jurisdictions of the
appropriate provisions of this Act and of such ordinances and

resolutions relating to alcoholic liquor as may be enacted[.]

However; such mayor, president of the board of trustees or
president or chairman of the county board or his or her designee

may appoint a person or persons to assist him in the exercise of
the powers and the performance of the duties herein provided for
such local liquor control commissioner. ( Emphasis added.)

Thus, the Commission - assists the Mayor to carry out his, duties as Commissioner

in his individual capacity as Mayor rather than as the head of the City Council. Therefore, the
Commission is not an advisory or subsidiary body of a public body such as the City Council

which is subject to the requirements of OMA. Although there may have been confusion about
the applicability of OMA in this instance because of information posted on the City's website and

because the Commission appears to have abided by requirements of OMA —such as posting

OMA Request for Review - 2018 PAC 55971

Dear

On December 4, 2018, the Public Access Bureau received your Request for

Review alleging that the Aurora Public Library Board of Trustees ( Board) violated the Open
Meetings Act ( OMA) in connection with its potential sale of real estate to a school district.

During a telephone conversation with an Assistant Attorney General in the Public Access Bureau
on December 28, 2018, you agreed to withdraw your Request for Review at this time but may

resubmit if you learn sufficient facts indicating that a majority of a quorum of Board members
discussed this matter outside of an open or closed ( executive) Board meeting. Accordingly, this
letter shall serve to close this files.

As we discussed, the Public Access Bureau received an OMA Request for Review
on November 13, 2018, alleging that the Board improperly discussed this matter during its
executive session meetings.

That Request for Review was assigned the file number 2018 PAC

55687, and that allegation is currently under review. You may wish to contact me in the next
several months to obtain a copy of the determination letter issued in that matter. You can reach

You have not alleged that the Council failed to include in its minutes of its

October 16, 2018, meeting a summary of all matters proposed, deliberated, or decided during the

responded to a public comment. This office has previously determined that OMA does not

require a public body to provide a detailed summary of any matter that was merely discussed by
a public body if the discussion did not rise to the level of deliberating upon or considering a
related decision. See, e. g., 111. Att' y Gen. PAC Req. Rev. Ltr. 40718, issued January 9, 2017, at

that the Council held deliberations or took final action related to the public comment at issue.

Because the facts you have alleged do not indicate that the Council violated the requirements of

OMA, this office has determined that no further action is warranted in this matter. Accordingly,

For the reasons explained below, the Public Access

three motions that were identified on the agenda only as " personnel items," I which Ms. Hines
alleges did not sufficiently identify the general subject matter of the Board' s final actions. Ms.
Hines also alleged that an agenda for the May 17, 2018, meeting was improperly modified Tess
than 48 hours before the May 17, 2018, meeting.

Ms. Hines' Request for Review also alleged that the Board violated OMA by not
posting a copy of the agenda for its June 25, 2018, special meeting on the District' s website at
least 48 hours before that meeting commenced; she asserted that the agenda•was not posted until
six

hours before

meeting.

On August 7, 2018, this office forwarded a copy of the Request for Review to the
Board and asked it to respond to Ms. Hines' allegations. Additionally, this office asked the

Board whether the District' s website was maintained by a full- time staff member. On August 13,
2018, this office received the Board' s response. On August 15, 2018, this office forwarded the
Board' s response to Ms. Hines; she did not reply.

The Senate debate on House Bill No. 4687, which was enacted as Public Act 97-

827, effective January 1, 2013, adding section 2. 02( c) to OMA, indicates that the General
Assembly intended this provision to ensure that agendas provide sufficiently descriptive advance
notice of the matters upon which a public body anticipates taking final action:
T] here was just no real requirement as to how specific they
needed to be to the public of what they were going to discuss that
would be final action. And this just says that you have to have a

The following agenda item stated:

In its response to this office, the. Board appears to assert that the language in the

closed session section of its agenda coupled with the reference to action on personnel items after
closed session provided the public with advance notice of the motions that the Board approved
on

employee

appointment

and

compensation.

When read in tandem, these agenda items may be

construed to indicate that the Board would take some form of action concerning personnel.
This office has previously determined that an agenda item for " personnel matters"
did not provide sufficient advance notice of a public body' s vote to. approve an employment

here, "

personnel items" could encompass virtually any matter relating to any District personnel.

Further, the language in the closed session section of the Board' s agenda did not reasonably

identify the general subject matter of the Board' s actions. Even though compensation and
appointment were among the subjects identified as potential topics of discussion, the list
included

other

irrelevant

employment-

related

topics.

Although

section 2. 02( c) does not require

that' the agenda identify the subject of possible final action by name or the specific action being
contemplated,

the Board' s agenda item was too imprecise to provide meaningful

notice to the

public that the Board would take action concerning the assignment of an administrator and the
compensation

of employees and administrators.

The Board argued that a superintendent' s report and an amended agenda provided

to Board members contained a more specific description of the actions to be taken after closed
session.

However, it is undisputed that members of the public did not receive copies of those

materials at least 48 hours prior to the meeting. As discussed above, the intent of section 2. 02( c)
of OMA is to ensure that an agenda provides members of the public with sufficiently

descriptive advance notice of the matters upon which a public body anticipates taking final
action.

Providing additional information only to Board members has no relevance to the Board' s

However, this office has confirmed that on September 25, 2018,

the Board re -voted on the two motions approving employee and administrator salaries' and on
July 19, 2018, the Board resolved the issue concerning the assignment of an administrator by a
vote in open session to approve the Columbia Middle School principal' s contract. 8 Therefore, no
additional action is necessary to remedy these violations.
Amending of May 17, 2018, Meeting Agenda

Section 2. 02( a) of OMA requires the posting of an agenda at least 48 hours in
advance of the holding of a meeting. A public body may not take final action on a matter unless
it has been properly posted on the agenda at least 48 hours prior to a meeting. See Rice v. Board
of Trustees ofAdams County, 326 Ill. App. 3d 1120, 1122- 1123 ( 4th Dist. 2002).
In its response to this office, the Board acknowledged

that an amended agenda

was provided to Board members at their desks immediately before the start of the May 17, 2018,
meeting. As noted above, the revision to the relevant agenda item appears to have been intended

to provide the Board with additional information; it did not add or remove any items proposed
for final action. It is undisputed, however, that the publicly posted agenda remained unchanged,
and continuously available for viewing, for the 48 hours before the meeting commenced.
The requirements of OMA in section 2. 02. of OMA are limited to publicly posted
agendas that provide advance notice to the public. See 111. Att' y Gen. PAC Req. Rev. Ltr. 25275,
issued December . l 7, 2018, at 3. Therefore, although section 2. 02( a) of OMA does not permit a

public body to take final action on an agenda item that was revised on a publicly posted agenda
less than 48 hours before the meeting commenced, no provision of OMA prohibits a public body
from separately amending an internal agenda to provide additional details on agenda items to

better inform board members of what is expected to transpire at a meeting. Accordingly, this

of

OMA

provides,

in

pertinent

part,

that "[

p] ublic notice of any

shall be given at least 48 hours before such meeting, which notice shall

also include the agenda for the special" meeting. Section 2. 02( b) of OMA ( 5 ILCS 120/ 2. 02( 6)
West 2016)) further provides:

Public notice shall be given by posting a copy of the notice

at the principal office of the body holding the meeting or, if no
such office exists, at the building in which the meeting is to be
held. In addition, a public body that has a website that the fulltime staff of the public body maintains shall post notice on its
website of all meetings of the governing body of the public
body. ( Emphasis added.)
Accordingly, under section 2. 02( b) of OMA, a public body is required to post a copy of the

agenda of a special meeting on its website 48 hours before the meeting, if its full- time staff
maintains the website. See, e.g., 111. Att'y Gen. PAC Req. Rev. Ltr. 39850, issued July 31, 2017,
at 3- 4.

Ms. Hines' Request for Review alleged that that the Board violated OMA by not

posting notice of its June 25, 2018, special meeting on the District' s website at least 48 hours
before that meeting commenced. The Board' s response to this office acknowledged that the

agenda was not timely posted to the website but explained that the full-time staff member
responsible for the website posting was on vacation when the agenda should have been posted.
The Board argued that its failure to post the agenda to its website did not violate OMA because it

provided proper physical notice of the special meeting by posting copies of the meeting agenda .

on the front door of the District office 48 hours before the meeting and by e -mailing the agenda
to the faculty and staff of the District and members of the Board.
Under the plain language of section 2. 02( b) of OMA, the Board was required to

post notice of the June 25, 2018, special meeting at the Board' s principal office and on its
website. Adopting the Board' s argument that a public body with a website maintained by a full-

time staff member somehow complies with this provision by only posting an agenda at the
Board' s principal office and by e -mailing the agenda to Board members is contrary to the plain
language

RE: OMA Request for Review — 2018 PAC 56235

Dear

This determination letter is issued pursuant to section 3. 5( b) of the Open Meetings
Act ( OMA) ( 5 ILCS 120/ 3. 5( b) ( West 2016)).

For the reasons set forth below, the Public Access

Bureau concludes that no further action in this matter is warranted.
In your Request for Review, dated December 18, 2018, you alleged that the Board
of Commissioners ( Board) of the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago
District) failed to perform semi- annual reviews of its closed session minutes in 2011, 2013,
2015, 2017,

2018.

You also alleged that the Board disregarded the spirit of the law by
keeping all of its closed session minutes from the previous eight years confidential.
and

Section 3. 5(

of

OMA ( 5 ILCS 120/ 3. 5(

requirements for the submission of a Request for Review of an alleged OMA violation as

public body has occurred may file a request for review with the
Public Access Counselor established in the Office of the Attorney
General

not, later than 60 days after the alleged violation.

If

facts concerning the violation are not discovered within the 60 -day
period, but are discovered at a later date, not exceeding 2 years
after the alleged violation, by a person utilizing reasonable

diligence, the request for review may be made within 60 days of
the

a public body' s decision not to release closed session minutes from the most recent eight

Your allegations that the Board did not properly perform semi- annual reviews in
2011, 2013, 2015, and 2017 are also unavailing because they were not submitted on time. The

you missed the deadline with respect to those years. Additionally, although you claimed that you
discovered the alleged violation concerning the 2017 semi- annual reviews on September 7, 2018,
when you received
a response
to a Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA) ( 5 ILCS 140/ 1 et seq.
West 2016)) request regarding the dates of the Board' s semi- annual reviews, the December 18,
2018, submission of your Request for Review occurred more than 60 days later. Therefore, you

did not submit your Request for Review " within 60 days of the discovery of the alleged
violation" as required under section 3. 5( a).

Lastly, as to the year 2018, the information you submitted to this office indicates
that as of September 7, 2018, the Board' s most recent semi- annual review and corresponding
report in open session as to the need for continued confidentiality occurred on March 1, 2018.

The minutes of that meeting include the item " Report on the Semi -Annual Review of Closed

Board' s October 4, 2018, meeting include the same item' and a link to the same type of report
asserting that the Board had reviewed its closed session minutes and had elected to keep them

confidential. 5 Because the publicly available information indicates that the Board was in
compliance with section 2. 06( d) of OMA as of the date of the submission of your Request for
Review, this office will take no further action in -this matter.

response you received from the

Village providing you with a copy of the August 14, 2018, Board meeting minutes. •
Accordingly, you discovered the content of the August 14, 2018, meeting minutes on or around
September 25, 2018, which is more than 60 days before you filed your December 20, 2018,
Request for Review. Further, your Request for Review does not allege facts to establish that you

did not discover within 60 days that the alleged threat was made at the meeting, despite. using
reasonable diligence.

To the contrary,. your Request for Review suggests that you learned of the

alleged threat soon after the August 14, 2018, meeting. Because you did not submit your

Request for Review before the statutory period for doing so expired, this office lacks authority to
review your allegations concerning the August 14, 2018, meeting minutes.

practices, the Public Access Counselor' s authority to resolve disputes is limited to alleged
violations of

See 15 ILCS 205/ 7( c)( 3) ( West 2016).

Section

1. 02

of

OMA ( 5 ILCS 120/ 1. 02 ( West 2016))

defines " meeting" as:

limitation, electronic mail, electronic chat, and instant messaging),
or other means of contemporaneous

interactive

communication,

a majority of a quorum of the members of a public body held for
the purpose of discussing public business or, for a 5 -member
public body, a quorum of the members of a public body held for
the purpose of discussing public business.

The Office of the Attorney General has stated that " whether a gathering falls
within the definition of meeting as used in the Act, would depend upon the peculiar facts in each
situation."
1974 I11. Att' y Gen. Op. No. S- 726, issued March 22, 1974, at 126. " In theory, there
is no absolute prohibition against the members of a public body attending an ' informational
meeting' without triggering the application of' OMA, as long as the members do not make
d] eliberational statements" or engage in " unrecorded discussions" among themselves. I11. Att' y
Gen. Op. No. 95- 004, issued July 14, 1995, at 10- 11. In that opinion the Attorney General
concluded that the " mere fact that a majority of a quorum of the members of a public body attend
and participate

in a bona fide presentation

on new legislative

developments

in an area of public

concern" did not make the presentation subject to OMA, but the extensive discussions of public

business by members of two county boards during the presentation did trigger the requirements
of OMA. ( Emphasis in original.)
I11. Att' y Gen. Op. No. 95- 004, at 10- 11; see also Nabhani v.
Coglianese, 552 F. Supp. 657, 661 ( N. D. I11. 1982) ( a gathering does not constitute a meeting for

In this instance, the facts you set forth in your Request for Review are insufficient

for this office to determine that a quorum of a 5 member public body or a majority of a quorum
of a public body with a greater number of members met and deliberated about public business
outside of a properly - noticed open meeting. Therefore, this office is unable to conclude that the
Committee

held improper

closed

meetings.

See 5 ILCS 120/ 3. 5 ( West 2012) ( requiring a

Request for Review to set forth " a summary of the facts supporting the allegation.").
You also alleged that the Committee refused to take questions during the public

comment portion of its July 2, 2012, meeting and that the Board did the same during its July 19,
2012, meeting, though both public bodies allowed comments. Section 2. 06( g) of OMA ( 5 ILCS

comment, but then reversed course and took public comment, means that the Board averted a

potential OMA violation by allowing public comment.

Lastly, with respect to your complaint about the audibility of meetings before the
building was renovated, hopefully that issue has since been rectified with microphones, as you
indicated you anticipated. If Board meetings still have audibility issues, you have the option of
submitting a new Request for Review alleging that one or more particular meetings were not
reasonably accessible on that basis.
The Public Access Counselor has determined that resolution of this matter does

not require the issuance of a binding opinion. This letter serves to close this matter. If you have

any questions, please contact me at ( 312) 814- 8413, jjones@atg.state. il.us, or the Chicago

alleging that the Village of Oquawka Board of Trustees ( Board) potentially
violated OMA in connection with its May 1, 2018, meeting.
alleged that the Board' s

explaining when and where notice for the meeting was posted. This office also asked the Board

To that

section

requires that " an agenda for each regular meeting shall be posted at the principal office of

the public body and at the location where the meeting is to be held at least 48 hours in advance of
the holding of the meeting."
Furthermore, section 2. 03 of OMA ( 5 [ LCS 120/ 2. 03 ( West 2016))
provides, in relevant part:

In addition to the notice required by Section 2. 02, each

body subject to this Act must, at the beginning of each calendar or
fiscal year, prepare and make available a schedule of all its regular

meetings for such calendar or fiscal year, listing the times and
places of such meetings.

If a change is made in regular meeting dates, at least 10
days' notice of such change shall be given by publication in a
newspaper of general circulation in the area in which such body
functions. ( Emphasis added.)

The Public Access Bureau has consistently determined that the language " regular meeting dates"
in section 2. 03 of OMA means that a public body must provide 10 days' notice for changing its
regular meeting dates going forward, such as from the first Monday of each month to the first
Tuesday of the month. See, for example, I11. Att'y Gen. PAC Req. Rev. Ltr. 37690, issued April
20, 2017, at 3. To reschedule a single regular meeting, a public body simply needs to provide at
least 48 hours' advance notice of the new meeting time. OMA does not set forth any procedural
requirements for a public body to cancel a single meeting.

attorney further stated that notice for the May 1, 2018, meeting was properly posted more than

48 hours in advance of the meeting at the public body's principal office and meeting location.
Acknowledging that the Board' s annual meetings schedule originally listed the date May 8, 2018,

the Board' s attorney asserted that this was a typo, and he noted that the text at the top of the
annual meetings schedule correctly stated that Board meetings would be held on the first
Tuesday of each month. Moreover,. the Board' s attorney stated that at least 48 hours prior to the
start of the May 1, 2018, meeting, the annual meetings schedule was amended to reflect the right
date.

Although the Board' s original typo of May 8, 2018, on the annual meetings

schedule appears to have inadvertently caused confusion about the actual meeting date, the
information that the Board' s attorney has provided to this office indicates that the Board properly
posted notice for its May 1, 2018, meeting, by posting the agenda at the Village' s principal office
meeting location

and the

no

less

than

48 hours in

advance of the

meeting.

Therefore,

the Public

Access Bureau concludes that the Board did not violate OMA in connection with notice of that
meeting.

RE: OMA Request for Review — 2012 PAC 22540

Dear

and Mi. Hadley:
This determination

Act ( OMA) ( 5 ILCS 120/ 3. 5(

e) (

letter is issued pursuant to section 3. 5( e) of the Open Meetings
West 2016)).

On December 10, 2012, this office received
Request for Review
alleging that the Stephenson County Board ( Board) violated OMA during its October 10, 2012,
meeting

by improperly

voting

on

an agenda

item.

He

asserted

that "[

t] he county board met on

October 10, 2012 with a[ n] agenda item to go out for bids on a canopy they were considering
building[,]" but that "[ i] nstead the board voted to accept a bid for the project of building the
canopy.
He further asserted that he did not attend the meeting because the agenda did not
il

indicate that the Board would vote on a bid, and thus he was deprived of the right to comment on

the matter before the vote. On January 2, 2013, this office forwarded a copy of
Request for Review to the Board and asked it to provide copies of the agenda and meeting
minutes for this office' s confidential review, together with a written response to
IE -mail

from

allegations. On January 14, 2013, this office received those materials. This office forwarded a
copy of the Board' s written answer to
Section' 2. 02(

c)

of

on January 15, 2013; he did not submit a reply.

OMA ( 5 ILCS 120/ 2. 02(

c) (

West 2012))

provides

that "[

a] ny

agenda required under this Section shall set forth the general subject matter of any resolution or
ordinance

that

will

be

the

subject of

final

action

at the

meeting."

The Public Access Bureau has

previously determined that the language of section 2. 02( c) of OMA " requires a public body' s
agenda to
identify the general subject matter of final action — not what particular action will be
taken by a public body." Ill. Att' y Gen. PAC Req. Rev. Ltr. 39177, issued February 2, 2016, at
3- 4 ( determining that final action under the agenda item " Illinois Rt. 53/ 120 Project
Environmental Impact Statement" did not violate section 2. 02( c) of OMA because by including
the item on the agenda, the Board sufficiently conveyed that it might take final action on the
matter).
In contrast, when a meeting agenda contains language indicating that the public body
will not be taking final action on a particular subject matter during that meeting, the public body
violates section 2. 02( c) if it proceeds to take action on that matter. See 111.. Att' y Gen. PAC Req.
Rev. Ltr. 54069, issued March 7, 2018, at 3 .( language " First Read" in an agenda item pertaining
to an ordinance indicated that the public body would not take final action on that ordinance
during that meeting and therefore the public body did not provide proper advance notice of its
vote on the ordinance under section 2. 02( c) of OMA).

This office has reviewed the Board' s October 10, 2012, meeting agenda and
minutes. The meeting agenda states, in relevant part:
CHAIRMAN' S REPORT

Action items from Standing Committees

Ultimately,

the minutes confirm, the

Board

voted to approve the

existing bid.

2Stephenson County Board, Agenda Topics, Chairman' s Report, Action Items. from Standing

Committees ( October 10, 2012).

 The Honorable William Hadley
January 8, 2019
Page 3

In this matter, the " front canopy re -bidding" project was identified on the agenda

as one of the items for consideration pertaining to the Nursing Center. While the item is listed
under

the portion

of

the

agenda

that

is

subtitled: "

Action items from Standing Committees[.]"

the language of the item only signaled that the Board might or might not elect to seek new bids
for the .front canopy project; this language does not create the inference that the Board would
consider the separate matter of approving an existing bid. Because the agenda item cannot be
reasonably construed to provide advance notice that the Board would take action to approve a

final bid on the canopy, this office concludes that the Board' s violated section 2. 02( c) of OMA.
Although it is not practical at this point for the Board to remedy this violation by reconsidering

and re -voting on the front canopy project, the Board should take steps to ensure that agendas for
all future meetings adequately and accurately describe the general subject matters on which the
Board may take final action.

RE:

Dear

OMA Request

for Review —2012 PAC 19345

and Mr. Talbett:
On April 18, 2012, this office received

Request for Review

alleging that the Village of Kildeer ( Village) Board of Trustees ( Board) violated the Open
Meetings Act ( OMA) ( 5 ILCS 120/ 1 et seq. ( West 2012)) by ( 1) not posting notice for the
Board' s April 2, 2012, meeting, and its Architectural Committee' s April 3, 2012, meeting at least
48 hours in advance of those meetings, and ( 2) scheduling the meetings outside the schedule
posted on the Village' s website. On May 2, 2012, this office forwarded a copy of your Request
for Review to the Board and asked it to provide a written response to your allegations.

On May 17, 2012, Mr. Michael S. Talbott, the Village Administrator whose
current title is Chief Village Officer, responded to the Public Access Bureau on behalf of the
Village, its Board, and Committee.

Mr. Talbottacknowledged

that the Village failed to post the

agendas a full 48 hours. in advance of the two meetings, explaining that the error was inadvertent,
that the agendas were posted as soon as the error was discovered, and that he would redouble his
efforts to make sure there is full compliance with the notice requirements

in the future.

The

Village Administrator also provided copies of the agenda for the Board' s April 2, 2012, special

meeting, the agenda for the Architectural Committee' s April 3, 2012, meeting, and a copy of its
schedule of regular meetings.

Section 2. 02( a)

of

OMA ( 5 ILCS 120/ 2. 02(

a) (

West 2012)) provides,

in pertinent

part:

An agenda for each regular meeting shall be posted at the principal
office of the public body and at the location where the meeting is
to be held at least 48 hours in advance of the holding of the
Public notice of any special meeting except a
meeting. * * *
the event of a bona fide emergency * * *
shall be
held
in
meeting

given at least 48 hours before such meeting[.)
Because it is undisputed that the notices for the Board' s April 2, 2012, special

meeting and the Architectural Committee' s April 3, 2012, meeting, were not posted 48- hour in
advance of those meetings, this office concludes that the Board violated the technical
requirements

of section 2. 02( a) of OMA.

No remedial

action is required

because the Board

confirmed that the violation resulted from an inadvertent error and ensured this office that it

would comply with the notice requirements in the future.
Section 2. 03

of

OMA ( 5 ILCS 120/ 2. 03 ( West 2012))

provides, in pertinent part,

that " each body subject to this Act must, at the beginning of each calendar or fiscal year, prepare
and make available a schedule of all its regular meetings for such calendar or fiscal year, listing
the times and places of such meetings." (
Emphasis added.) Because the Board' s April 2 meeting
was a special meeting, not a regular meeting, section 2. 03 of FOIA did not require the Village to

list that meeting on its schedule of regular meetings. Additionally, because the Village' s
schedule of regular meeting provided that the Architectural Committee meets only as need arises,
and, therefore, does not hold regularly -scheduled meetings, it is not required to produce an

annual schedule of regular Architectural Committee meetings. See 111. Att'y Gen. PAC Req. Rev.
Ltr. 47865, issued May 22, 2017, at 2 ( providing transparency through an annual schedule setting
forth a public body's plans to meet in the future is inapplicable when the public body does not
meet

at regular

intervals

and

does

not

know

when

it

will

meet).

Accordingly, the Public Access

Bureau concludes that the Board and Architectural Committee did not violate section 2. 03 of
OMA.

that the Village of Minier ( Village) Board of Trustees ( Board) may have violated OMA at its

This determination letter is issued pursuant to section 3. 5( e) of the Open Meetings
Act ( OMA) ( 5 ILCS

For the reasons that follow, the information

provided to the Public Access Bureau does not support the allegation\ that the Palos Township
Board of Trustees ( Board) violated OMA in connection with its May 14, 2018, meeting.
BACKGROUND

On May 25, 2018,

submitted a Request Tor Review to the

Public Access Bureau alleging that the Board violated OMA in connection with its May 14,
2018, meeting.

stated that the Board entered the meeting room as a group, arriving

five minutes late. He alleged that the Board had held an improper private meeting before the
start of the official meeting. Additionally,
alleged that the Board adjourned the
meeting before certain members of the public who wished to address the Board had an
opportunity to do so. According to
members of the Take On Hate coalition
attended the meeting, and 30 of the coalition's members had wished to address the Board that
evening.

When the public comment part of the meeting began at 7: 11, four
of our members

addressed

the board.

Then at 7: 21, one of the

board' s supporters took the microphone from thefront of the room
and addressed the public with insults. While the sergeant - at -arms

interrupted our speakers, he did nothing to stop this man violating

rules of the meeting. Within one minute of this speaker beginning,
the board supervisor quickly called for adjournment and left
without hearing the other 26 members of the public that had come

address the Board. This office further asked the Board to provide a copy of any Board. rules or
policies governing public comment, along with copies of the meeting agenda, minutes, and

video/ audio recordings, if any, of the open session portion of the May 14, 2018, meeting. On

I am. relieved to hear that no discussion of public business

took place in the meeting that took place before the public meeting
began. Please ask the Board to refrain from holding private
discussions during the time set aside for public meetings. Please be
aware that this conduct does create the appearance

that public

business is being discussed before the public meeting begins. 151
Accordingly,

accepted the Board' s denial that it discussed any

township matters or other public business prior to the commencement of the May 14, 2018,
meeting, but correctly highlighted that private gatherings during times scheduled for Board
meetings may raise an appearance of impropriety. Because there is no indication that the Board
discussed public business prior to the start of the official meeting, this office concludes that the

Board did not violate section 2( a) of OMA, but the Board may wish to refrain from holding
privategatherings immediately prior to or during the times scheduled for Board meetings in
order to avoid a potential appearance of impropriety.
Public Comment

only pursuant to rules it has established and recorded, which must tend to accommodate, rather
than unreasonably limit, the right to address public officials. See 111. Att' y Gen. Pub. Acc. Op.
No. 14- 009, issued September 2, 2014, at 4, 7. A public body may adopt reasonable rules

was designed to incite a response from the audience.

Several

members of the public came up and took a card, asked the question

during this time somebody from the audience played
the theme song to Jeopardy. After several members of the public
played this jeopardy like game and had no comment to the .
Township Board, the Supervisor indicated that public comment
was not for games and that the Township Board would not
participate in such. 161

As to the remainder of the public comment session, the Board contended that a
few members of the public addressed the Board until " a person chose to speak who did not hold

the views of a majority of the attendees and he was cut off by the protestors and not permitted to
proceed

with

The Board stated that it felt that it was unable to maintain order

and consequently decided to adjourn the meeting to ensure the public safety. In particular, the
Board

explained: "

There was yelling at the person wishing to speak and it was the feeling of the

Board that control of the meeting was lost, there was no decorum by the persons in the audience
and for safety reasons the meeting was adjourned. i8

rules of decorum with respect to the member of the public who he claimed used racist and
insulting language towards the majority of the attendees. He asserted: " Instead of rebuking this

Based on this office' s review of the information provided by both parties, the facts
do not demonstrate that members of the public were improperly restricted from addressing the
Board. While the parties dispute whether the first few individuals who spoke were addressing
the Board, as opposed to the audience, the available information suggests that there was some

This office has

previously determined that although the right to comment during an open meeting includes the
right to ask questions of public officials, OMA does not require public officials to respond to

questions or comments. See, for example, Ill. Att'y Gen. PAC Req. Rev. Ltr. 35858, issued
October 20, 2015, at 2. Specifically, this office has noted:
Section 2. 06( g) does not mandate that public bodies conduct a
question and answer session; rather, a public body must allow an

Thus, the plain language

of section 2. 06( g) of OMA contemplates the opportunity for
citizens to express their views to members Oa public body. OMA

does not require any response by or answers from public officials.
111. Att' y Gen. PAC Req. Rev. Ltr. 37391, issued January 11, 2016,
at 7.

Thus, OMA did not require the Board to respond to questions posed during public
comment. Because this office has not received information suggesting that the first few
individuals to speak were unable to complete their questions, this office is unable to conclude

that the Board improperly restricted those individuals from addressing its members. As to the
remainder of the public comment session, both parties have indicated that an individual began to

make comments that were contentious in nature. According to the Board, the comments incited
some raised voices and passionate reactions from meeting attendees. It appears that the Board
stopped the individual from continuing to speak when his comments upset the decorum of the

meeting and the Board reasonably felt that it could not maintain order. The meeting minutes also
indicate that there were conflicts in the parking lot before the meeting and significant unrest

Under these circumstances, this office is unable to conclude that the Board

improperly limited the opportunity for members of the public to address the Board. There is no
indication that the Board adjourned the meeting to restrict the content of speakers' comments.

Rather, it appears that a tense atmosphere pervaded the meeting and that emotional responses to

comments interfered with the decorum of the meeting and provided reasonable grounds. for the
Board

to

believe that it

was

impractical and potentially

unsafe

to

continue.

Further,

this office

has not received any evidence from which we could conclude that the police presence interfered
with or caused a chilling effect on public comment. Accordingly, this office concludes that the

Board did not violate section 2. 06( g) of OMA• during its May 14, 2018, meeting.

not require the issuance of a binding opinion. This letter shall serve to close this matter. If you

Chicago Mayor' s Office for People with Disabilities ( MOPD) Task Force on Employment and

Opportunity for People with Disabilities ( Task Force). In particular, you allege that
the Task Force did not have an agenda for its March 21, 2018, meeting and did not keep minutes

provides:

A person who believes that a violation of this Act by a

concerning the violation are not discovered within the 60 -day

after the alleged violation, by a person utilizing reasonable

diligence, the requestfor review may be made within 60 days of
the discovery of the alleged violation. The request for review

You have not, however,

asserted that you used reasonable diligence to discover those alleged violations within 60 days, .

but despite that reasonable diligence, you did not discover the alleged violations within 60 days
of their occurrence. Further, it appears that a person utilizing reasonable diligence would have

discovered within 60 days that there was no agenda for the March 21., 2018, Task Force meeting,
because the agenda for the February 7, 2018, meeting identified the next meeting date as on
March 21, 2018.

Likewise, a person utilizing reasonable diligence' would have discovered that

there were no minutes for meetings held before December 7, 2017, because the meeting minutes
would have to have been approved within 30 days of the meetings or at the Task Force' s second
subsequent regular

meeting,

whichever

is later.

For example,

the second subsequent regular meeting after the December 6, 2017, meeting of the Task Force,

Section 3. 5(

a) of

OMA ( 5 ILCS 120/ 3. 5(

West 2016))

provides

that "[ a] person

who believes that a violation of this Act by a public body has occurred may file a request for
review with the Public Access Counselor established in the Office of the Attorney General[.]
The request for review * * *
must include a summary of the facts supporting the

allegation." (

added.)

Under OMA, deliberations among a majority of a quorum of the members of a

nine -member public body like the Board must be held during a properly -noticed open meeting,
unless the topic of the discussion meets one of the exceptions listed in section 2( c) of OMA ( 5
ILCS 120/ 2(

c) (

West 2017

Supp.), as amended by Public Act 100- 646, effective July 27, 2018)

and the meeting is properly closed in accordance with section 2a of OMA ( 5 ILCS 120/ 2a ( West
2016)). 5 ILCS 12012( a) ( West 2017 Supp.), as amended by Public Act 100- 646, effective July
27, 2018. OMA does not, however, prohibit a public body from deciding not to discuss a topic
in open session at a particular time, as long as the public body does not hold an unauthorized
closed session about the topic.

Distributing an updated version of a confidential memorandum to the members of

a public body is not tantamount to a closed session. OMA defines " meeting" as " any gathering,
whether

in

or

by

video

or audio

conference,

call,

electronic

or

other means of contemporaneous interactive communication, of a majority of a quorum of the

body

held for

the purpose

of

discussing

public

business."

5 ILCS 120/ 1. 02

Merely circulating a confidential memorandum to the members of a public body

does not meet this definition. Nor is there any indication that the Board improperly entered

closed session during a meeting to discuss the installation of an independent inspector general.
Because the information set forth in your Request for Review does not indicate that the Board

potentially violated OMA, the Public Access Bureau has determined that no further action is
warranted

in this matter.

RE:

Dear

OMA Request for Review — 2018 PAC 53683

and Mr. Storino:

This determination is issued pursuant to section 3. 5( e) of the Open Meetings Act
e) ( West 2016)).
For the reasons explained below, the Public Access

OMA) ( 5 ILCS 120/ 3. 5(

Bureau cannot conclude that the Elmurst Zoning and Planning Commission ( Commission)
violated OMA in connection with the semi- annual review of its September 28, 2017, closed
session

minutes.

BACKGROUND

On June 21, 2018, this office received
Request for Review
alleging that the Commission did not perform a review of the minutes from its September 28,

2017, closed session within 60 days of discovering that it had not complied with the requirement
in

2. 06( d)

section

of

OMA ( 5 ILCS 120/ 2. 06( d) ( West 2016)) that closedsession

minutes be

reviewed on at least a semi- annual basis. On June 29, 2018, this office sent a copy of the
Request for Review to the Commission and asked that it provide a written response to

allegations. Specifically, this office asked the Commission whether it had met the requirements

of section 2. 06( d) of OMA. if the Commission had discovered that it had not reviewed its closed
session minutes

in

accordance

with section

2. 06( d),

this office asked it to clarify when the

Commission learned of this issue. This office also asked the Commission to identify any
meeting( s) from the past twelve months during which it determined and reported whether the
need for confidentiality still existed as to its closed session minutes and to provide copies of the

minutes from any such meeting. On July 9, 2018, the Commission provided an answer. On July
16, 2018, this office forwarded a copy of the Commission' s response to

who replied on

July 27, 2018.
DETERMINATION

Section 2. 06( d) of OMA provides that:

Each public body shall periodically, but no less than semiannually, meet to review minutes of all closed meetings. At such

meetings a determination shall be made, and reported in an open

session that ( 1) the need for confidentiality still exists as to all or
part

of

those minutes

or (

2)

that the minutes or portions thereof no

longer require confidential treatment and are available for public

inspection. The failure of a public body to strictly comply with the
semi- annual review of closed session written minutes, whether

before or after the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 94th
General Assembly, shall not cause the written minutes or related

verbatim record to become public or available for inspection in any
judicial proceeding, other than a proceeding involving an alleged
violation of this Act, if the public body,. within 60 days of

discovering its failure to strictly comply with the technical
requirements of this subsection, reviews the closed session minutes

and determines and thereafter reports in open session that either ( 1)
the need for confidentiality still exists as to all or part of the
minutes or verbatim record, or ( 2) that the minutes or recordings or
portions thereof no longer require confidential treatment and are
available for public inspection.

The parties do not dispute that the Commission did not " strictly compl[ y] with the
requirements

September 28, 2017, meeting minutes to determine whether the need for confidentiality still
existed.

However, the parties dispute when the Commission discovered its technical violation.
alleges that the Commission became aware of the violation sometime between March 1,

2018, and April 6, 2018, when the City Clerk and the City's attorneys addressed a FOIA request
and a

Request for Review concerning

the

City' s

with

section

2. 06( d).

position is that the FOIA request and the Request for Review put the Commission on notice that
it had violated section 2. 06( d) and the Commission then had 60 days, or until June 6, 2018, at the

latest, to review the closed session minutes and vote on the need for continuing confidentiality.
The Commission counters that the Clerk' s knowledge of any violation cannot be
imputed to the Commission, as the Clerk is not a member of the Commission. It asserts that the
Commission Chair first discovered the technical violation on either June 14, 2018, or June 15,

2018, when she reviewed the agenda for the Commission' s June 19, 2018, meeting, which
included a semi- annual review of the closed session meeting minutes from September 28, 2017.
The remaining members of the Commission became aware of the error at the June 19, 2018,

meeting, during which the Commission voted against releasing the September 28, 2017, closed
session minutes.

In its response to this office, the Commission did not address when its attorneys

whether

the

attorney has actually

communicated

The materials

submitted to this office do not definitively establish when the Commission' s attorneys

learned of the violation. Accordingly, because of the conflicting facts, this office is unable to

conclude that the Commission violated section 2. 06( d) of OMA by failing to review the closed
session minutes within 60 days of discovering its initial technical violation.
However, even if this office were to find that the Commission violated section
2. 06( d),

no remedial action would be necessary. The Commission voted on June 19, 2018,

against releasing the September 28, 2017, closed session minutes. 2 Even if this vote was more

than 60 days after the Commission discovered its initial violation, this office has previously
concluded that OMA does not require a public body to remedy a failure to review closed session

minutes within 60 days of discovering a technical violation of section 2. 06( d) by disclosing all of
its

unreviewed

closed session minutes.

21n his reply,

111. Att' y Gen. PAC Rev. Ltr. 52812, issued August 28,

contended that the Commission' s vote not " to release the Closed session

meeting minutes from September 28, 2017" did not meet the minimum requirements of section 2. 06( d), which
requires a public body to determine whether the need for confidentiality of the minutes still exists. E- mail from
to Laura Harter (

Therefore,

your submission

does not provide facts from which

this office could conclude that the Board violated OMA. This is not to say that meeting and
taking action without a quorum of the members of a public body is proper; rather, those quorum

requirements are determined by the Board' s governing rules and statutes, not OMA.

acknowledged that it did not approve the minutes of its March 19, 2014, meeting until June 18,

2014, 2 which was the third subsequent meeting after the March 19, 2014, meeting. Although the
Board has acknowledged that the March 19, 2014, meeting minutes were not approved in a

timely manner, because the Board has since approved those meeting minutes, no further action is
necessary at this time to remedy its violation of section 2. 06( b).
Section 2. 06( g)

of

OMA

provides

that "[

a] ny person shall be permitted an

opportunity to address public officials under the rules established and recorded by the public
body." A public body violates section 2. 06( g) of OMA when it: ( 1) prohibits a member of the
public from addressing its members in a manner inconsistent with its established and recorded
rules, or (2) prohibits a member of the public from providing public comment pursuant to its
established and recorded rules but those rules unreasonably restrict that person' s right to address

Request for Review asked this office to evaluate the propriety of the
Board' s public comment rules absent a specific complaint that the Board enforced those rules to

improperly prevent a member of the public from addressing public officials at a meeting.
Because the Request for Review did not allege that any member of the public was improperly
prohibited from addressing the Board, this office concludes that
has not provided
facts supporting the allegation that the Board violated section 2. 06( g) of OMA. Accordingly, ,
this office concludes that this portion of

that " it is unclear how requiring a speaker to submit his or her address or telephone number on a

Accordingly, if the Board still has and enforces a rule that requires individuals who wish to

address the Board to identify themselves by address on a form submitted to the Board President,
this office advises the Board to review and revise its rules for public comment to ensure that they
uphold the public' s statutory right to address the Board while implementing only those
reasonable limitations that are necessary to advance significant governmental interests, such as
maintaining order and decorum.

OMA Request for Review — 2018 PAC 52862

and Mr. Humphrey:
This determination is issued pursuant to section 3. 5( e) of the Open Meetings Act

OMA) ( 5 ILCS 120/ 3. 5(

e).(

West 2016)).

For the reasons explained below, the Public Access

Bureau concludes that the Pleasant Plains Community Unit School District No. 8 ( District)
Board of Education ( Board) violated OMA in connection with its February 26, 2018, March 26,
2018, and April 23, 2018, meetings.

BACKGROUND

On April 26, 2018, this office received

Request for Review

alleging that during the closed session portions of its February 26, 2018, March 26, 2018, and
April 23, 2018, meetings, the Board may have held unauthorized discussions under the pending
litigation exception found in section 2( c)( 11) of OMA ( 5 ILCS 120/ 2( c)( 11) ( West 2017 Supp.)).
In support of her allegations,

contended that because no litigation is known to be

pending against the District, the Board' s discussions must not have fallen within the scope of that
exception. On April 30, 2018, this office sent a copy of the Request for Review to the Board and
requested that the Board or its representative provide a written response to the allegations in the

The section 2( c) exceptions are to be " strictly construed, extending only to subjects clearly

Section 2( c)( 11)

of OMA permits public bodies to discuss " probable or imminent"

determination must be made " by examining the surrounding circumstances in light of logic,

The court then concluded that the school board violated OMA by entering closed session without
clarifying whether the " litigation" to be discussed was pending or " by failing to state, on the
record, (

concluding:
T] he

section

2( c)(

11) exception does not permit a public body to

enter closed session to discuss the possibility of litigation merely
because it has taken action that generated public opposition, such
as a backdoor referendum effort. In the absence of reasonable,

specifically identified grounds to believe that litigation was close

at hand or more likely than not to ensue, the mere possibility that a
lawsuit might be filed does not constitute " probable" or
imminent" litigation within the scope of section 2( c)( 11) of OMA.

Ill. Att' y Gen. Pub. Acc. Op. No. 16- 007, at 8.
This office has reviewed the verbatim recordings and closed session minutes for

the February 26, 2018, March 26, 2018, and April 23, 2018, meetings, and finds that the minutes

do not contain findings that litigation was probable or imminent, as is expressly required by
section

2(

reference

c)(

11).

The February 26, 2018, and April 23, 2018, closed session minutes make no

to litigation; the March 26, 2018, closed session minutes include the term " pending

litigation,"

but include neither a citation to any pending case nor any finding by the Board that

litigation was probable or imminent. Instead, the minutes of the closed sessions and the verbatim
recordings reflect that the Board discussed a drainage issue that was once the subject of

threatened litigation. The Board explained in its letters to this office that no litigation was ever

filed and the person who had threatened to sue passed away before the meetings at issue. At
most, the Board' s discussions concerned the possibility of litigation. Accordingly, the Board
violated section 2( a) of OMA by holding improper closed session discussions during its February
26, 2018, March 26, 2018, and April 23, 2018, meetings.

To remedy this violation, this office asks the Board to vote to disclose the
portions of the February 26, 2018, March 26, 2018, and April 23, 2018, closed session minutes
and closed session verbatim recordings that document the Board' s discussion of the drainage

issue, provide

In its response to this office, the Board explained that it has discussed

Requests for Review during its closed sessions. This office confirms that the Board discussed a

pending Request for Review during the closed session of its February 26, 2018, Board meeting.
This office has previously found " that a Request for Review constitutes ' litigation' pending
before an ' administrative tribunal' [ as contemplated by section 2( c)( 11) of OMA] during the time

As a result, this office did not seek a response to the Request for Review from the Board until

February 5, 2018. The Board timely responded on February 14, 2018, and the first Board
meeting after it received notice of the Request for Review was February 26, 2018. Because the
Board did not have an opportunity to discuss the Request for Review at a regular, monthly Board

Indeed, such a requirement would

defeat the purpose of the confidential discussion. Accordingly, this office concludes that the
Board did not violate OMA by not including findings of probable or imminent litigation in its
open session minutes or during the open session of its meetings.
Section 2a of OMA

appears to allege that the Board' s minutes for its February 26, 2018, and
March 26, 2018, meetings do not include a sufficient description of the closed session

On September 26, 2017, Mr. Kevin DuJan filed this Request for Review alleging
that the Commission and Board violated OMA at their September 18, 2017, meetings.

Specifically, he asserted that the Village president and the Village attorney improperly restricted
Mr. DuJan and another member of the public, Ms. Deborah Wilson, from addressing the Board

by repeatedly interrupting their public comments. He also alleged that the Commission
improperly restricted Ms. Wilson' s ability to comment at this meeting based on the topic that, she
wished to address and attempted to do the same to him. Mr. DuJan' s Request for Review also

contends that the Village' s rules for public comment do not comply with section 2. 06( g) of OMA
5 ILCS/ 120/ 2. 06( g) ( West 2016)).

On October 13, 2017, this office forwarded a copy of the Request for Review to
the Village and requested that it provide a copy of any established and recorded Village rules

governing public comment during meetings, and copies of the agenda, open session minutes, and
any audio or video recordings of the September 18, 2017, Commission and Board meetings
along with a written response to the allegations in this Request for Review.
On October 24, 2017, this office received a written response with links to the

of the written response by the Village and indicated that he would like a chance to reply. On that
date, this office forwarded a copy of the Village' s written response to Mr. DuJan; he did not
reply.
BACKGROUND

On September 18, 2017, the Commission, a held a special meeting that began at

6: 30 p. m., the substance of which was to discuss a particular request for a liquor license. The
members of the Commission consist of the Village President and the members of the Board. 2
Although the written response indicated that agendas for the September 18, 2017, Commission

and Board meetings, and the meeting minutes for the Village' s meeting accompanied the written response, this office
did not receive paper copies of those materials.

Instead,

in an October 24, 2017, e- mail from counsel

However, according to chapter 4. 32 of the Code, when acting in this capacity, the Commission
members have very limited authority. Specifically, section 4. 32. 030( 6) of the Code provides,

w] hen sitting as the liquor control commission, the members of the corporate authorities may
exercise no authority other than the liquor control powers in accordance with this Chapter [ which

exclusively deal with licenses for alcoholic liquors]. i3 The Board held its regular meeting
immediately following the Commission' s special meeting.
It is 'undisputed that the Village has established and recorded rules governing
public comment for both the Commission and the Board, and that both the Commission and the

Board provided an opportunity for public comment during their meetings. Therefore, this office
reviews the rules that were enforced during the September 18, 2017, meetings in terms of their

Although OMA does not specifically address the types of rules that a public body may adopt,

Ms. Wilson then began to address her disagreement

with an appointment

to the Village' s Board

During this portion of her public comment, she was

interrupted by the Village's president, Mr. Patrick Horcher. Mr. Horcher informed Ms. Wilson
that this topic was not relevant to the business of the Commission because it did not have

authority over the Board of Police and Fire Commissioners but that she would have the

opportunity to speak about this topic before the Board at its meeting, which Mr. Horcher stated
would begin in approximately five minutes. Ms. Wilson disagreed with Mr. Horcher' s authority
to limit her speech and she attempted to argue that she was permitted to speak about any topic
when the Village Attorney interrupted her and explained that the above- cited rule prohibited her
comment on that topic.

Ms. Wilson then left the podium.

Next, Mr. DuJan was called and walked up to a podium set in front of the
Commission

members.

Mr. DuJan provides Mr. Horcher with a book, which he stated contained

information about the law firm with which the Village Attorney is affiliated, he then began
addressing the Commission about his perceived failings of the Village Attorney and his dislike. of

this law firm. During Mr. DuJan's public comment, Mr. Horcher, the Village Attorney, and Mr.
DuJan repeatedly spoke over one another. Mr. Horcher and Village Attorney informed Mr.
DuJan that the topic. was not relevant to the business of the Commission

but that he could

address the matter at the Board meeting, and they indicated that they were attempting to enforce
the Village' s public comment rules. Mr. DuJan continued his public comment stating that the
Commission was violating OMA because OMA permitted him to speak about anything he
wanted, and he continued to cite his concerns about the law firm. Mr. DuJan then completes his
comments and leaves the podium to return to his seat.

The Village' s response to this office asserted that the relevancy rule imposed upon
Mr. DuJan and Ms. Wilson at the September 18, 2017, Commission meeting was reasonable and
served a significant governmental interest. Specifically, the Village stated:
Here, the Village' s rules and regulations are content and
viewpoint

neutral and serve the significant

government

interest of

maintaining civility and decorum.

The significant interest of effectively conducting a meeting

is particularly true for a subsidiary body. A Commission like the
Liquor Control Commission has extremely limited authority and a
limited, narrow purpose. Allowing public comment on any and al!
topics at Liquor Commission

meetings would, and does, interfere

with the orderly and effective action of the Village Board meeting.
In fact, at the September 18, 2017 Liquor Control Commission

meeting, Chairperson Horcher pointed out that the actual business
of the Liquor Commission

would take less time than the public

comment portion. Additionally, as repeatedly told to Mr. DuJan
and Ms. Wilson, they were able to talk about those topics, namely
the qualification

BOFPC [ Board

of Village
of

Police

attorneys

and

and appointments

to the

Fire Commissioners], at the Village

Board meeting that immediately followed the Liquor Control
Commission meeting. The Village Attorney indicated to Mr.
DuJan that he would be able to make all of his comments about the

Village Attorney and the law firm representing the Village when
the Village Board meeting began in less than five minutes. Thus,
speakers have ample alternative means of communication. 161

In his Request for Review, Mr. DuJan contends that OMA requires a public body to allow

of the public to " speak about whatever
they want to speak about[ ]"

This office has previously determined that a rule which limits members of the
public to only provide comments related to subjects listed on the agenda exceeded the scope of

by section 2, 06( g). See, e. g., 111. Att'y Gen. PAC Req. Rev.
Ltr. 38037, issued August 1, 2016; 111. Att'y Gen. PAC Req. Rev. Ltr. 45349, issued March 16,

permissible

rulemaking

authorized

2017. These determinations, however, do not support the contention that participants have

complete freedom during the public comment portion of an open meeting to provide comment on
any issue that one wishes. Instead, this office emphasized that under section 2. 02( a) of OMA
5 ILCS/ 120/ 2. 02( a) ( West 2016)),
the public body itself is able to discuss matters concerning

the business of the public body that are not specifically listed on the agenda, and therefore, it
would be unreasonable to prohibit members of the public from doing so. 111. Att' y Gen. PAC
Req. Rev. Ltr. 38037, issued August 1, 2016, at 3; 111. Att' y Gen. PAC Req. Rev. Ltr. 45349,
issued March 16, 2017, at 6.

Moreover, courts have consistently recognized an important governmental interest

in limiting comments to matters directly relevant to that public body' s business. See, e. g.,
Scroggins

v.

City

of Topeka, Kan., 2 F.

Supp.

2d 1362, 1373 ( D. Kan. 1998) (

city council did not

violate first amendment to the United States Constitution by restricting personal comments about
an appointee to a mayoral commission that were not directly relevant to the business of the
public
body). Requiring a public body to permit public comment on matters unrelated to its
public business would impede the public body' s ability to run efficient meetings. See Rowe v.
City of Cocoa, Fla., 358 F. 3d 800, 803 ( 11th Cir. 2004) (" a city council meeting is not open for
endless public commentary speech but instead is simply a limited platform to discuss the topic at
hand.").

As the Commission has described in its response, the Commission has very

limited authority and purpose, which is restricted solely to matters related to licenses for
alcoholic liquors. The Commission does not have the authority to discuss, or make decisions,
regarding neither the appointment of the Village attorney nor the appointment of
commissioners

to the

Board

of'

Fire

and

Police Commissioners.

In this case, the video

recording shows that the Commission restricted Ms. Wilson and Mr. DuJan' s comments only
when they spoke about topics that were not relevant to the business of the Commission, in any

way. Accordingly, this office concludes that the Commission did not violate OMA by
enforcing section 2. 03. 060( b) of the Code to limit public comment to matters that were
germane

to matters

that the

Commission

has the authority

to consider.

Public Comment at Board Meeting
Section 2. 03. 060( a) of the Code contains the pertinent Village rule governing
public comment at Board meetings, and provides:
Citizen Concerns and Comments at Village Board

a)

Meetings. Members of the general public may address the
board with concerns or comments regarding issues relevant
to village business. Issues relevant to village business are
defined to mean information about village events; issues that

the public body has the authority to address; items listed on
the agenda; and items or issues previously voted on by the
village board. or that the village board has the authority to
consider or vote on in the future. The village president or his

designee shall strictly restrain comments to matters that are
relevant to village business and shall not permit repetitious
comments or arguments. Members of the general public who
wish to address the board must sign the request to speak form

prior to the commencement of the public meeting. The
persons submitting a petition, concern or other comment shall
be allotted five minutes to present their points. The manager

or corporate authorities may respond for the village.

Next, Mr. DuJan addressed the Board about certain aspects of previous Board

meetings that Mr. DuJan believed violated the constitution, ancient Greek mythology, his
perceived failings of the Village Attomey, and his dislike of that law firm. At no point was

Mr. DuJan interrupted.

After approximately five minutes, an alarm can be heard at which

point Mr. Horcher informed Mr. DuJan that his five minutes to address the Board had expired.
Mr. Horcher asked Mr. DuJan to wrap up his comments, which Mr. DuJan did.

Based on our review of the recording, this office is unable to conclude that Mr.
Horcher' s brief interruption of Ms. Wilson during the Board' s September 18, 2017, meeting
deprived her of an opportunity to fully address the Board. The recording established that Ms.
Wilson was permitted to address the Board and provide public comment, and that the brief
interruption did not prevent Ms. Wilson from continuing to address the Board until after the

five- minute bell rang. This office has previously determined that a temporary interruption that
does not preclude a speaker from completing his or her public comment does not constitute an
improper restriction on public comment. III. Att'y Gen. PAC Rev. Ltr. 37496, issued on
December

11, 2015, at 3.

Additionally, this office' s review of section 2. 03. 060( a) of the Code confirmed
that the Board' s established public comment rules limit a person' s comments to five minutes.

The Attorney General has previously determined that " a public body may legitimately

comment."

111. Att' y Gen. Pub. Acc. Op. No. 14-

Because the Village' s established and recorded rules

permit the Board to limit a person' s comments to five minutes, and because such a rule appears
designed to advance a significant governmental interest in holding orderly and efficient

meetings, this office concludes that Board did not violate section 2. 06( g) of OMA by enforcing
the five- minute public comment rule at the September 18, 2017, meeting. Accordingly, the
Public Access Bureau concludes that the Board did not violate section 2. 06( g) of OMA during
its September 18, 2017, meeting.
Additional . Complaints

about Public Comment

Rules

Although Mr. DuJan' s Request for Review alleges that the entirety of the Village's

rules governing public comment run afoul of section 2. 06( g), the Public Access Bureau generally
reviews a particular rule governing public comment only if there is an allegation that a member
of the public has been prohibited from speaking at a meeting because of that rule, as opposed to
evaluating the propriety of all rules absent a specific complaint that the rules prevented a
member of the public from addressing officials at a meeting. Accordingly, this office
emphasizes that a determination. by this office that one of a public body' s rules for public
comment violates, or does not violate, OMA cannot be extrapolated

RE:

OMA Request for Review —2018 PAC 53781

Dear Mr. Springer and Mr. Wagnon:

This determination is issued pursuant to section 3. 5( e) of the Open Meetings Act
OMA) ( 5 ILCS 120/ 3. 5(

e) (

West 2016)).

For the reasons explained

below, the Public Access

Bureau concludes that the O'Fallon Community Consolidated School District No. 90 ( District)
Board of Education ( Board) did not violate OMA in connection with an e- mail statement issued

on May 17, 2018.
BACKGROUND

On June 28, 2018, this office received Mr. Steven Springer' s Request for Review

alleging that six Board members discussed and coordinated via e- mail the drafting of a May 17,
2018, statement to the parents and students in the District. On July 3, 2018, this office sent a
copy of the Request for Review to the Board and requested that it provide a written response to
Mr. Springer' s allegations. This office asked the Board to identify any and all discussions and
communications that occurred between and, among Board members outside of open meetings

concerning the May 17, 2018, e- mail statement referenced in Mr. Springer' s Request for Review.
This office requested copies of any records that documented those discussions, as well as copies

of any records of communications, such as e- mails and text messages. This office also asked the
Board to address whether it took improper final action regarding the May 17, 2018, e- mail
statement. On July 11, 2018, the Board provided a written response and the requested materials.
On July 25, 2018, Mr. Springer replied. On November 28, 2018, and December 6, 2018, in
response to follow- up inquiries from this office, the Board provided additional materials.
According to the background information provided by the parties, Mr. Springer
made comments at an April 15, 2018, O' Fallon City Council meeting " on the intended audience
for the reading of a children' s book] and the possible improper use of a publically funded
facility."' Many members of the public were outraged by Mr. Springer' s comments. According
t a news report, hundreds of people attended the Board' s May 15, 2018, meeting, many of

whom spoke during the public comment periods to share their thoughts on Mr. Springer' s
statements.2 One member of the public read excerpts from copies of Mr. Springer's e- mails in
which he questioned school policy concerning the needs of transgender and other students. The

comments in Mr. Springer's e- mails added to the growing public controversy. On May 17, 2018,
six Board members issued an e- mail statement to local news media outlets, District staff, and
parents, as follows:

In addition,

section 2. 02( a) of OMA ( 5

generally requires a public body to provide the public with at

least 48 hours advance notice of its meetings. In order for the requirements of OMA to apply, a
gathering must constitute a " meeting" as defined by section 1. 02 of OMA ( 5 ILCS 120/ 1. 02
West 2016)):

Meeting" means any gathering, whether in person or by
video or audio conference, telephone call, electronic means ( such
as, without limitation, electronic mail, electronic chat, and instant
messaging),

or other means of contemporaneous interactive

communication, of a majority of a quorum of the members of a.

public body held for the purpose of discussing public business or,
for a 5 -member public body, a quorum of the members of a public
body held for the purpose of discussing public business.
Under this statutory definition, a " meeting" may include communications through
e- mail or other electronic means. The Board is comprised of seven members. Accordingly, four
Board members constitute a quorum, and a majority of the quorum is three members. Therefore,
contemporaneous, interactive e- mail or other electronic communications involving at least three
members of the Board which concern." public business" would ordinarily constitute a meeting of

Final Action Outside of an Open Meeting
Section 1

of

OMA ( 5 ILCS 120/ 1 ( West 2016))

provides:

It is the public policy of this State that public bodies exist
to aid in the conduct of the people' s business and that the people
have a right to be informed as to the conduct of their business. In

order that the people shall be informed, the General Assembly
finds and declares that it is the intent of this Act to ensure that the

actions of public bodies be taken openly and that their
deliberations be conducted openly. •
With respect to final action by a public body, section 2( e) of OMA ( 5 ILCS
Supp.)) provides: " No final action may be taken at a closed meeting.

action shall be preceded by a public recital of the nature of the matter being considered and other
information that will inform the public of the business being conducted."
The Appellate Court has held that when a public body finalizes a decision in a
document, that final action must be taken openly:
No public body in Illinois subject to the Open Meetings Act can

take final action by merely circulating some document for
signature and not voting on it publicly. Imagine, for instance, the
legal problems if the Chicago city council " adopted" ordinances by
publicly voting on a concept that had never been reduced to
writing, directed a staff attorney to prepare it in a more detailed
written form, circulated the final version around city hall for
signatures of a majority of the 50 alderman, and then ordered the

city clerk to publish it as if it were a valid legislative act. Howe v.
Retirement Bd. of Firemen' s Annuity & Benefit Fund•of Chicago,
2013 IL App ( 1st) 122446, ¶ 26, 996 N. E. 2d 664, 974- 75 ( 2013)

finding board' s written denial of benefits invalid because the
board had circulated the decision for signatures privately rather
than voting on it in open session).
Further, this office has previously determined that a board violated section 2( e) of OMA by
improperly taking final action when four. of five board members signed a letter in support of a
wage ordinance without publicly discussing the letter prior to its signing. See Ill. Att'y Gen.
PAC Req. Rev. Ltr. 21599, issued March 19, 2013, at 2.

Mr. Springer argues that the act of issuing a statement is a final action. He
contends that the statement

pertained

to the business of the Board because its purpose was to

clarify the Board' s position on a contentious public issue. The Board does not dispute that it
issued

the statement without

discussing

or

voting

on

it

at an open

meeting.

However, the Board

asserts that because Mr. Springer' s controversial comments did not involve Board business, the

Board' s statement concerning Mr. Springer' s comments cannot be characterized as involving
Board business. The Board also noted that the Board members did not make any decisions
regarding Mr. Springer' s comments other than to issue the statement.
It is undisputed that Mr. Springer' s comments resulted in significant public
controversy.

Six members of the Board determined that they would address the public' s

concerns by issuing a statement expressing a general sentiment of unity and disavowing Mr.
Springer's comments. Contrary to Mr. Springer's assertion that issuing a statement on a
contentious public

issue is

has found that

Likewise, the six members' expression of disagreement is a statement of opinion that has no

In sum, the May 17, 2018, e- mail statement did not constitute final action, as it

this office concludes that the Board did not improperly take final action outside of a public
meeting.

not require the issuance of a binding opinion. If you have any questions, please contact me at the

Public Access Bureau alleging that the minutes of the Board' s June 28, 2018, meeting did not
adequately describe the changes implemented by an ordinance that was approved at the meeting.

the Board' s response to
On October 7, 2018, she e- mailed this office arguing that
the full text of an ordinance should be disclosed to the public before any meeting in which it is
considered by the Board or any of its committees.
DETERMINATION
The Open Meetings Act provides that public agencies exist to aid in the conduct

of the people' s business, and that the intent of the Act is to assure that agency actions be taken
openly and that their deliberations

be

conducted

openly."

Gosnell v. Hogan, 179111. App. 3d

As an initial matter, no provision of OMA requires a public body to post the full
text of an ordinance prior to a meeting in which the public body considers and/ or takes final

action on the ordinance. Further, no provision of OMA requires a public body to publicly post
the board packet provided to members of the public body. Rather, section 2. 02( c) of OMA (5
ILCS 120/ 2. 02(

c) (

West 2016)) merely

provides: "

Any agenda required under this Section shall

set forth the general subject matter of any resolution or ordinance that will be the subject of final
action
at the meeting." ( Emphasis added.)
Thus, although providing the public with the full text
of an ordinance in advance of a meeting would inform the public of the details of an action the

public body is considering taking, a public body is not required to do so.
As to the sufficiency of the Board' s June 28, 2018, meeting minutes, section
2. 06( a)

of

OMA ( 5 ILCS 120/ 2. 06( a) ( West 2016))

complained that the Board had not posted a video of its June 28, 2018,

meeting. A 2.public body is required to record only its closed sessions, and it may keep those recordings confidential.

The plain language of section 2. 06( a)( 3) of OMA requires only that minutes summarize the
discussion regarding matters proposed, deliberated, or decided.
The Board' s June 28, 2018, meeting minutes state, in pertinent part:

In its response to this office, the Board correctly asserted that no provision of
OMA required it to include the text of the ordinance in the meeting minutes. The Board also
noted that the text of the ordinance had since been posted on the County' s website as part of the
Board packet.

The Board' s June 28, 2018, meeting minutes reflect that the Board read in the
ordinance concerning the definition of the Animal Services Administrator position, suspended
the rules, and voted to approve the ordinance.

Although

contended

that the minutes

do not describe the changes made by the ordinance, OMA requires that meeting minutes
summarize only a public body' s discussions concerning an ordinance it has approved; OMA does
not otherwise require meeting minutes to recite the contents of such an ordinance. This office
has not received information indicating that the Board discussed in detail the changes to be made
by the ordinance before' voting on the matter. To the contrary, the video recording of the open

session of the meeting, posted on the County' s website, reveals no significant back -and -forth
discussion

of

the

contents

of

the ordinance.

i

Board member Dave Fiduccia introduced the

ordinance, briefly stating that it would change the definition of "Animal Services Administrator"
in the County Code to provide that the employee holding the position need not be a licensed
veterinarian.'

Haney explained his understanding that there was no State statutory requirement for an animal
services administrator to be a licensed veterinarian and asked a colleague whether that was
correct; she replied that although there needs to be a veterinarian on staff to provide medical
advice under State law, the animal services administrator does not need to be a veterinarians

The Board proceeded to pass the motion to suspend the rules, and Chairman Haney asked
whether the Board wished to discuss the ordinance; no member of the Board spoke up, and the

ordinance passed. 6 Although simply adding the substance of the change ( removing the
requirement that the position be held by a licensed veterinarian) would substantially improve the

quality of the meeting minutes, the Board did not hold a substantive discussion concerning the
change made by the ordinance. Therefore, the Board' s June 28, 2018, meeting minutes do not
violate section 2. 06( a) of OMA. This office, however, encourages the Board to keep detailed

minutes concerning the actions it takes during meetings in order to keep the public informed as
to the conduct of its business.
The Public Access Counselor has determined that resolution of this matter does

not require the issuance of a binding opinion. This letter shall serve to close this matter. If you

For the reasons set forth below, the Public Access

Bureau has determined that no further action is warranted in this matter.

On January 2, 2019, this office received your Request for Review alleging that the
Policy Committee ( Committee) of the Board of Education ( Board) of West Chicago Community
High School District 94 ( School District) violated OMA in connection with its November 27,

2018, meeting. Specifically, you alleged that the Committee improperly convened the meeting
with only one Board member. present. You stated that the Committee is currently comprised of
three people: two Board members, Mr. Rich Nagel and Mr. Gary Saake, and the School
District' s superintendent, Dr. Doug Domeracki, as an ex -officio member. You directed this
office to the Committee' s November 27, 2018, meeting minutes, which were approved at the
Board' s December 18, 2018, meeting, and noted that the Committee started its meeting with only

As a threshold matter, the Public Access Counselor' s authority to resolve disputes
is limited to alleged violations of OMA and the Freedom of Information Act ( 5 ILCS 140/ 1 et
15 ILCS 205/ 7( c)( 3) ( West 2016).

seq. ( West 2016)).

OMA concerns the transparency with

which public bodies meet and conduct business in relation to the public; it does not govern the
composition

or

of committees of a public

membership

body. Similarly, it generally does not

govern the number of members of a committee who must be present to form a quorum and take

action. Accordingly, this office is not authorized to review claims concerning the extent to
which school administrators may serve on Board committees as ex -officio members and whether
a certain number of Board members must be present to constitute a quorum for purposes of
convening a committee meeting.

The minutes reflect that the Committee did not discuss policies until all of its

While you question whether the meeting should have been convened in
the first place when only one Board member was initially present, this office has not received
information indicating that the recess during the meeting was intended to circumvent the notice
or other requirements of OMA. Although the delay in commencing the meeting in earnest may
have been inconvenient for some members of the public, such a delay does not violate OMA. As
members

present.

to the completeness of the meeting minutes, section 2. 06( a)( 3) of OMA (5 ILCS 120/ 2. 06( a)( 3)
West 2016)) provides that minutes are to include " a summary of discussion on all matters
deliberated,

proposed,

or

decided,

and

a

record of

any

taken."

The language " proposed,

deliberated, or decided" means that a public body is not required to provide a detailed summary
of any remarks that did not rise to the level of deliberating on a form of action. See, for example,

I11. Att' y Gen. PAC Req. Rev. Ltr. 25528, issued March 5, 2014. Here, absent any indication that
the Committee voted to recess the meeting, OMA did not require the minutes to specify the
reason for the recess if a reason was given. If Mr. Saake and Dr. Domeracki voted to recess the

meeting, however, that vote should have been recorded in the minutes under the plain language
of section 2. 06( a)( 3).
Accordingly, the Committee should be mindful of that requirement.

requested a copy of the minutes of any meeting within the previous twelve months during which

their open meetings within 30 days after the meetings or at the second subsequent regular

meetings as required by section 2. 06( b) of OMA. This office has found that committees of the
whole are not separate public bodies from boards, but rather, provide a different meeting format

for boards. See 111. Att' y Gen. PAC Rev. Ltr. 46954, issued May 23, 2017; see also Black' s Law

Accordingly, this office considers the Board and the

Committee to be the same public body.
Section 2. 06( b) provides:

A public body shall approve the minutes of its open

General Assembly apply to violations alleged to have occurred at
meetings held on or after the effective date of this amendatory Act
of

the 99th

Assembly. (

Emphasis added.)

Request for Review was submitted on November 14, 2018.
Therefore, under the plain language of section 3. 5( a) of OMA, this office may not review alleged

OMA violations that occurred before September 14, 2018, because they occurred more than 60
days before
filed this Request for Review. 3 Section 3. 5( a) of OMA does permit a
person tofile a Request for Review within 60 days of discovering a violation, for up to two years
after the date of the violation, but only if the requester can show that facts concerning the
violation were not discovered within 60 days despite the requester' s reasonable diligence.
Although
Request for Review indicated that he submitted a FOIA request on
October 22, 2018, it did not assert. that he discovered the alleged OMA violations outside of the

60 -day period, or that he failed to discover the alleged OMA violations within 60 days despite
having exercised reasonable diligence.
Moreover, because section 2. 06( b) requires the Board, as the governing body of

the Village, to post the minutes on the Village' s website within 10 days after the approval if fulltime staff of the Village maintains its website, and because it is undisputed that both the Board
and the Committee' s minutes are available on the Village' s website, 4 it appears
would have been able to discover the alleged violations within 60 days of the alleged violations.

Because

allegations concerning the approval of the Board and the

Committee' s April 2018, and July 2018, meeting minutes are untimely, section 3. 5( a) of OMA
precludes

the

Public Access Counselor

from reviewing

those

allegations.

Accordingly, this

review is limited to allegations concerning the timely approval of the Board and the Committee' s
August 2018, and September 2018, meeting minutes and whether the Board conducted a semiannual review of all of its closed meeting minutes.

3The Village' s website indicates that the Board held regular meetings during the relevant

timeframe on April 24, 2018, July 10, 2018, July 24, 2018, August 14, 2018, August 24,. 2018, September 11, 2018,
and September 25, 2018, and special meetings on July 16, 2018, and August 6, 2018. The Committee held relevant
regular meetings on April 3, 2018, July 14, 2018, August 21, 2018, and September 18, 2018. See

Section 2. 06( b) of OMA

As discussed above, section 2. 06( b) of OMA requires a public body to approve its

meeting minutes within 30 days after its meetings or at the public body' s second subsequent
regular meeting, and requires the public body to post those minutes on the public body' s website
within 10 days after the approval if full-time staff of the public body maintains its website.

Additionally, this office cautions the Board to be mindful of its obligation to approve all meeting

Section 2. 06( d) of OMA

In addition to the timeliness of the approval of meeting minutes,

Request for Review alleged that the. Board violated OMA by failing to conduct semi- annual
reviews of closed session minutes as required by section 2. 06( d)' to determine whether the need

for confidentiality of those minutes still exists. Section 2. 06( d) provides:

In its response to this office, the Board acknowledged that it had not conducted

timely reviews of meeting minutes in accordance with this provision. Therefore, the Public
Access Bureau concludes that the Board violated section 2. 06( d) of OMA. Additionally, the
Board' s supplemental response to this office indicated that the Board did not have a plan to
conduct a semi- annual review of its closed session minutes. This office requests that the Board

remedy this violation by promptly conducting a semi- annual review of its closed session minutes
to determine whether the need for confidentiality of those minutes still exists and to report, in
open session, on which minutes need to remain confidential and which minutes no longer require

confidential treatment and may be disclosed to the public, if any. This office also reminds the
Board that it must continue its review of closed session meetings, no less than semi- annually, as

required by section 2. 06( d) of OMA, and cautions the Board to be mindful of its obligations to
fully

comply

with

OMA.

RE:

Dear

This determination is issued pursuant to section 3. 5( b) of the Open Meetings Act
OMA) ( 5 ILCS 120/ 3. 5( b) ( West 2016)). The Public Access Bureau has received your Request
for Review alleging a potential violation of the Open Meetings Act ( OMA) (
5 ILCS 120/ 1 et seq.
West 2016))

by the Public Affairs and Safety Committee of the City of Elmhurst ( Committee) in
connection with its December 10, 2018 meeting. This office' s review of the information you
have furnished, however, provides no basis for this office to conclude that the Committee
violated OMA.

during the December 10, 2018,

meeting. Although you acknowledged that the minutes of the December 10, 2018, meeting
indicated that the Committee held a voice vote in open session to enter closed session and that
the vote was unanimous, you have alleged that the meeting minutes do not indicate how each
member voted. Specifically, you asserted that the minutes are insufficient because one or more

members of the Committee may " have remained silent during the voice vote, and the silence
might not have been recorded as an abstention."

Section 2a of OMA provides, in pertinent part:

A public body may hold a meeting closed to the public, or
close a portion of a meeting to the public, upon a majority vote of a
quorum present, taken at' a meeting open to the public for which

At any open meeting of a public body for which proper

notice under this Act has been given, the body may, without

RE:

Dear Dr. Lalmalani, Mr. Manzo, Ms. Pruss, and Mr. Friedman:

This determination letter is issued pursuant to section 3. 5( e) of the Open Meetings
Act ( OMA) ( 5 ILCS 120/ 3. 5(

e) (

West 2016)).

On December 18, 2012, this office received Mr. MichaelManzo's Request for

Review ( 2012 PAC 22637) alleging that the Village of Oak Brook ( Village) Board of Trustees

Board) violated OMA at its December 11, 2012, regular meeting. Mr. Manzo, who was and still
is a Board trustee, stated that the Board entered closed session " to discuss the request of a village
trustee to receive an unredacted police report
regarding

alleged that the Board improperly voted in closed session to permit the trustee to receive an •
unredacted report. Specifically, he contended that " it was improper to poll the board in closed

session without a follow- up ' public' vote" or public discussion of the matter. 3 On January 23,
2013, Mr. Manzo submitted additional information to this office further explaining his claims
regarding the matter and questioning the participation of the trustee at issue in the closed session.
On December 28, 2012, this office received a similar Request for Review ( 2012

PAC 22721) from Dr. Gopal Lalmalani alleging that the Board violated OMA at its December
11, 2012, meeting by improperly entering closed session to discuss the handling of an anticipated
Freedom

Information

Act ( FOIA) ( 5 ILCS 140/ 1

et

seg. ( West 2012)) request from then -

Trustee Stelios Aktipis. Dr. Lalmalani, who was and still is Village President, explained that
Trustee Aktipis had been the subject of a criminal investigation, and that Trustee Aktipis had

indicated his intent to file a new FOIA request seeking a largely unredacted copy of the police
report pertaining to that investigation after receiving a significantly redacted copy in response to
his initial request. Like Mr. Manzo, Dr. Lalmalani alleged that the Board took an improper
consensus vote

on

the matter, claiming

that "[

t] he majority consensus vote/ opinion of the

Trustees was secured during the closed session resulting in the FOIA officer being allowed to
respond with a largely 4 unredacted version of the police report in the event of filing of the request
by Trustee

Aktipis[.]"

Dr. Lalmalani also contended that the Board failed to provide adequate

notice to the public of its discussion of the matter and improperly took final action in closed
session when it reached consensus on how to handle the forthcoming request. He noted that he
and

two other Board members opposed " this closed session ' consensus

responsibilities."

By its plain language, this exception allows a public body that

conducts criminal investigations to discuss those investigations in closed session.

With respect to a public body's ability to take final action, section 2( e) of OMA (5
provides: "
No final action may be taken at a closed meeting. Final

In the Board' s response to this office, Mr. Friedman stated that the Village had

received a message from an individual raising allegations against Mr. Aktipis. That message was
reported to the Village' s police department, which launched a criminal investigation of the
matter. According to Mr. Friedman, Trustee Aktipis submitted a FOIA request to the Village

seeking the police report concerning
the investigation, and he was provided a copy of the report

with

certain parts redacted.

Mr. Friedman confirmed that Trustee Aktipis and his attorney

subsequently indicated that they would submit a second FOIA request seeking a mostly
unredacted copy of the report. Mr. Friedman contended that the Board properly entered closed

performance of the

related

to the FOIA

request."

9 In particular, he asserted:

Regarding the review of the performance of the FOIA

Officer, the Closed Session discussion focused not only on how the
FOIA Request was handled ( with regard to the nature and extent of
the redactions),

but also on how the FOIA Officer would perform

his discretionary duties with regard to Trustee Aktipis' s stated
intent to file a new FOIA request for the Police Report with the

narrative portions left largely unredacted. tt01
Mr. Friedman

that

acknowledged

at

the end of the

discussion, "

there appeared to

be a consensus of a majority of the trustees that, under these circumstances it would not be

unreasonable
for the FOIA officer to provide the largely unredacted version of the Police
11
Report[.]"

He

contended,

however, that "[ t] here was also a consensus that the Village Board

did not need to take any action to direct the FOIA Officer in the exercise of his discretion,"
particularly given that " he now had the benefit of the sense of the Board regarding his past
performance on the FOIA Request and any future performance on similar FOIA requests that
may come from Trustee Aktipis.
Mr. Friedman argued that the Board did not take any final
i12

action

in reaching

consensus on the matter.

a

He

contended: "

Polling the Board is not final

action and, therefore, it was in no way inconsistent for the Board to take a straw poll on whether
there was consensus13 on how the FOIA Officer should deal with any future FOIA Request for

In his reply to that answer, Dr. Lalmalani disputed the Board' s claim that it had
entered closed session to discuss the performance of the police or FOIA officer. He asserted

that, to his knowledge, no written or verbal complaint had been lodged against either party, and
that " there was

no

attempt

or

intention

to

discuss

the FOIA

officer'

s performance[

1"

lq

Dr.

Lalmalani argued that, rather than discussing employee performance, the Board discussed its

policy and practice in handling FOIA requests and took action by providing instruction to the
FOIA Officer on how to handle any future FOIA request submitted by Trustee Aktipis. ' He
contended, in pertinent part:

No proper notice was given to the public that an official

policy that was long standing would be discussed and changed in

closed door session. This is clearly demonstrated by the meeting
minutes and the audio tape. The discussion of this policy itself
cannot

be

claimed

to

be properly discussed in

closed

door.

11$ 1

Mr. Manzo also disputed the Board' s claim that it had entered closed session to

discuss the performance of the police or FOIA officer, asserting that the claim " is simply not true
and was not placed on the agenda.

i16

Similar to Dr. Lalmalani, he contended that " the board

took action in the closed door session which changed an official policy and instructed the village
FOIA]

officer to take action."

17

He further maintained that the Board did not provide proper

notice to the public regarding the Board's discussion and action on the matter.

Based on this office's confidential review of the closed session recording and
minutes, the Board' s discussion did not fall within the scope of the section 2( c)( 1) exception.

Although the FOIA officer's response to Trustee Aktipis' FOIA request and his response to future

requests may have related to his job duties, the Board did not specifically discuss the merits or
conduct of the FOIA officer. Instead, the majority of the closed session discussion focused on
the underlying FOIA request and how the Village should respond to a future FOIA request

seeking the report at issue. This discussion did not pertain directly to the FOIA officer' s job

Further, this office is unable to conclude that the discussion fell within the scope

the Board' s discussion did not center on the conduct of "ongoing,

investigations." The closed session materials reflect that the Board

deliberated more generally on the issue of whether a largely unredacted version of the report
concerning the investigation could be provided in response to a potential future request.
Although the State' s Attorney' s Office asserted that " the content and subject matter of the

that discussion

concerned FOIA policy and procedure rather than how the investigation was conducted.

Accordingly, this office concludes that the Board violated section 2( a) of OMA by holding an
unauthorized closed session discussion. This office requests that the Board vote to publicly

disclose the portion of the closed session verbatim recording concerning Trustee Aktipis' FOIA
request. This office also cautions the Board to confine its future closed session discussions to the
section 2( c) exceptions it cites prior to adjourning to closed session, and to construe those
exceptions

narrowly.

With regard to Mr. Manzo' s and Dr. Lalmalani' s assertion that the Board reached
a majority consensus on the issue in closed session, the Board did not dispute that claim but

asserted that the consensus did not amount to final action. Specifically, the Board argued that the
consensus was non- binding and did not require the FOIA officer to take any particular action.•
As noted above, a public body does not violate OMA if it reaches a tentative consensus on a
matter or takes a preliminary vote in closed session. See, for example, I11. Att' y Gen. PAC Req.
Rev. Ltr. 31510, issued September

6, 2017,

at

3- 4.

In this matter, this office is unable to

conclude that the majority consensus reached during the closed session constituted a final action
of the

Board.

While the Board provided a majority opinion to the FOIA officer as to how to
handle a future FOIA request by Trustee Aktipis, it appears that the FOIA officer was not
required to

follow that

opinion

and,

in fact, did

not

do

so.

According

to the

Board, "[ t] he Village

Manager subsequently notified the Village Board on December 18 that the FOIA Officer would
remain consistent with Village practice unless the Board took official action in open session
19
legally directing the FOIA Officer otherwise."
This office has not received information

indicating that the Board attempted to enforce the consensus opinion/ vote on any FOIA requests
or otherwise incorporated the decision in the Village' s formal policy regarding FOIA requests.

This determination is issued pursuant to section 3. 5( e) of the Open Meetings Act

For the reasons that follow, the Public Access Bureau

concludes that the Board of Education ( Board) of Williamsfield Community Unit School District

No. 210 ( District) improperly restricted public comment during its December 11, 2017, meeting,
but did not violate OMA during its January 8, 2018, meeting.

Public Comment Rules

In response to this office' s request fora copy of the Board' s rules regarding public
comment, the Board submitted a copy of section 2: 230 of the Williamsfield School Policy
Manual entitled " Public Participation at School Board Meetings and Petitions to the Board"
Board Rules).

Section 2: 230 of the Board Rules provides:

At each regular and special open meeting, members of the
public and District employees may comment to or ask questions of
the School Board, subject to reasonable constraints.

The individuals appearing before the Board are expected to
follow these guidelines:
1.

Address the Board only at the appropriate time as

indicated on the agenda and when recognized by the Board
President.

2. Identify oneself and be brief. Ordinarily, comments shall
be limited to 5 minutes. * * *

5.

covered in Board policy.
6. Conduct oneself with respect and civility toward

131

Attached to the Board' s agendas for the December 11, 2017, and January 8, 2018,
meetings, however, is a " Message from Board President Ingle" concerning Board Policy 2: 230,
which

lists

three

additional

guidelines

for

public

comment (

Message).

4

The recordings provided

to this office establish that the Board President read the Message prior to the public comment

portion of each of the meetings in question. The first provision directly conflicts with Board
Rule 2, stating that the " customary time allotted per speaker is 2 minutes" rather than five
minutes.

The

second provision

adds

to Board Rule 6, providing that "[ q] uestions,

requirements

concerns, or praises are to be directed to the Board as a whole and may not be put to any
individual

member of the Board or administrative

staff. i5

When construing the meaning of a statutory provision, the primary objective is to
ascertain the intent of the legislature.

See, e. g., DeLuna v. Burciaga, 223 111. 2d 49, 59 ( 2006).

The plain language of the statute is the best indication of that intent, and if that language is clear
and unambiguous,

People v. Rinehart, 2012 IL 111719, 124, 962 N. E.

2d 444, 45,2 ( 2012).

The plain language of section 2. 06( g) requires that the rules governing
public comment not only be " established" but also " recorded" by the public body. Although the
Board asserted,

and

agreed,

that the two minute restriction

on public comment

has

been its custom, the Board has not presented any evidence that the conflicting provision of the

handed the Board some records and did not continue to comment.

Upon review of the parties' written submissions and the recording, itis apparent
that the President enforced the second provision of the Message requiring a commenter' s

concerns to be directed to the Board as a whole and not to any individual member of the Board.
As explained above, this provision was not an established or recorded rule. The Board asserted

that " it was not unreasonable, nor antithetical to policy or the law for the Board President to
intervene

on

of

individuals

to assure an

and civil public

proceeding."'

We agree

that a public body has inherent authority to conduct a meeting in an efficient and orderly manner.

persons addressing the Board to " conduct oneself with respect and civility toward others."
See I11. Att' y Pub. Acc.

Although OMA does not specifically address the nature of rules that a public
body may permissibly adopt, a board may adopt rules to maintain order and decorum at public
meetings to ensure that meetings are conducted efficiently. See Timmon v. Wood, 633 F. Supp.

However, such rules must tend to accommodate,

rather than to

unreasonably restrict, the right to address public officials. See I.A. Rana Enterprises, Inc. v. City
Supp. 2d 912, at 923- 25 ( N. D. I11. 2009). While a public body may enforce
rules regarding decorum, content -based restrictions must be narrowly construed. See I.A. Rana

With respect to the December 11, 2017, meeting, it does not appear that
comments created a disturbance or otherwise interfered with the efficiency of the
Board' s proceedings. The recording of the meeting indicates that the Board' s restrictions of
comments were directed towards her references to a particular Board member in
connection with public business of the District.

When the President first interrupted

she had only mentioned a certain Board member' s conduct pertaining to a school directive. The
Board does not contend that any other aspect of

conduct was disruptive other than

Therefore, this office concludes that the Board violated section 2. 06( g) of OMA

by ( 1) imposing an unestablished and unrecorded rule limiting public comment and ( 2)
impermissibly restricting

right to address public officials at the December 11,

2017, meeting.
In accordance with the conclusions expressed in this determination, this office

requests that the Board refrain from limiting public comment at any future meetings except
pursuant to its established and recorded rules. In addition, this office requests that the Board

permit members of the public to refer to Board members or other public officials who they are
criticizing or otherwise commenting on by name, notwithstanding that the members are not

In the event that the Board chooses to amend its established

and recorded Board Rules regarding public comment, this office notes those rules must tend to
accommodate,

rather than unreasonably

restrict, the right to address public officials, and

therefore should be appropriately narrowly - tailored to regulate only those governmental interests
relating to decorum and efficiency.

Although

public bodies

must generally permit members of the public to refer to Board members or other public officials

that they are criticizing or otherwise commenting on by name, when public comment discusses
personal matters separate and apart from the performance of public duties, the business of a

board, or other public body matters, a board may limit the public comment to conserve time and

to conduct the meeting in an efficient manner. See Scroggins v. City of Topeka, Kan., 2 F. Supp.
2d 1362, 1373 ( D. Kan. 1998) (

city council did not violate first amendment to the United States
Constitution by restricting personal comments about an appointee to a mayoral commission that
were not
directly relevant to the business of the public body). A review of the recording reveals

that the President initially interrupted
while she was speaking about personal matters
between herself, her ex- husband, and Mr. Howard. The President was within his authority to
limit the discussion of these highly personal matters to conserve time and run an efficient
meeting. Although, after this initial interruption,
connected her personal remarks to
matters pertaining to the Board, the connection was not apparent at the time of the initial
interruption.

While it may have been a better practice to have allowed

to conclude

during its January

8, meeting.

After the initial interruption, the Board again interrupted

by notifying

her that she was singling out an individual Board member. This interruption was an apparent
attempt to use its unestablished and unrecorded guideline in the Message to limit
comments. As discussed above, the Board' s use of its unestablished and unrecorded rules to
regulate

comments was a violation of OMA. However, because the Board allowed

to complete her public comment unimpeded by further interruption, albeit after a
long pause because of a separate disruption of the meeting, we are unable to conclude that the
Board improperly restricted
from addressing public officials at its January 8, 2018,
meeting.

In summary, this office concludes that the Board violated section 2. 06( g) of OMA
during its December 11, 2017, meeting, but did not violate section 2. 06( g) of OMA during its
January 8, 2018, meeting. The Public Access Counselor has determined that resolution of this
matter does not require the issuance of a binding opinion. This letter serves to close this file. If

RE:

OMA Request for Review — 2019 PAC 56456

Dear Mr. Allen:
This determination

is issued pursuant to section 3. 5( b) of the Open Meetings

OMA) ( 5 ILCS 120/ 3. 5( b) ( West 2016)).

Act

For the reasons that follow the Public Access Bureau

has determined that this Request for Review is unfounded.

Your Request for Review alleges that the Coles County Board ( Board) violated
of OMA ( 5 1LCS 12012. 06( a) ( West 2016)) because its January 8, 2019,
amendment to its December 18, 2018, special meeting minutes, regarding the starting date of an
Interim State' s Attorney, did not accurately reflect the actions taken by the Board during its
December 18, 2018, special meeting. As part of your Request for Review, you provided copies
section

2. 06( a)

of the minutes of the December 18, 2018, special meeting and the January 8, 2019, meeting. You
also provided links to video recordings of a portion of the December 18, 2018, special meeting,
taken after the Board returned from its executive session, and of the January 8, 2019, meeting.
This office has reviewed

the minutes and the relevant portions of the video recordings.

Section 2. 06( a) of OMA, provides,

in pertinent

part:

All public bodies shall keep written minutes of all their
meetings,

whether

open

Minutes shall include, but

or closed * * *.

need not be limited to:

3)

a summary of discussion on all matters proposed,

deliberated, or decided, and a record of any votes taken.

Prior to any amendments, the minutes of the December 18, 2018, special meeting,
state that the Board went into executive session " to discuss the Appointment of Interim States
Attorney to fill the position of Brian Bower States Attorney."' After returning to open session,
the Board minutes reflect that Chairman Zuhone appointed and the Board approved " Jesse
2

Although the minutes do not contain a starting
Danley to serve as Interim State' s Attorney[.]"
date for Mr. Danley to begin as Interim State' s Attorney, a plain reading of the minutes as a

whole establish that the Board appointed Mr. Danley to serve as Interim State' s Attorney to fill
the position of the current State' s Attorney upon vacation of that position.

Any other

interpretation would be illogical as the Interim State' s Attorney could not fill Mr. Bowers'
position until he left office. As you state in your Request for Review, if the start date for the
Interim State' s Attorney' s began on December 18, 2018, rather on when the position was vacated,

there would be two state' s attorneys. The January 8, 2019, minutes establish that the Board
passed a motion to amend the minutes of December 18, 2018, meeting " to add clarification on

the starting time of Jesse Danley' s appointment. Jesse Danley will start as Interim States
Attorney

as

soon

as

Brian Bower

exits

his

position.

Adding such clarification in the minutes of

the obvious intention of the resolution did not violate OMA.

On October 6, 2015, this office received

She also stated that the College issued a press

release about the single vacancy on August 17, 2015, and that it " included a quote from
College] President Daniels asserting to the effect that [ College] trustees are dynamic visionary
leaders for

the college."

2

She

alleged that "[

t] he portrayal of [College] trustees as visionary

leaders contradicts both the [ College' s] code of ethics and code of conduct. Therefore, if the

code of conduct or code ethics were revised to allow active engagement in leadership of the

such changes were

She further alleged that

sections of the code of ethics/ code of conduct did not align

with " the sections regarding protocol of board involvement in affairs of college operations."
As a threshold matter, the Public Access Counselor' s authority to resolve disputes
is limited to alleged violations of OMA and the Freedom of Information Act ( 5 ILCS 140/ 1 el
seq. ( West 2016)). See 15 ILCS 205/ 7( c)( 3) ( West 2016). OMA concerns the transparency with
which public bodies meet and conduct business in relation to the public; it does not govern the

substance of a code of ethics/ code of conduct.

Further, a Request for Review must include a

body violated OMA. 5 ILCS 120/ 3. 5( a)
did not provide facts supporting the allegation that the Board
violated OMA in connection with the code of ethics/ code of conduct; she did not identify any
deficiencies with any particular meeting or set forth information indicating that the Board held an
improper private meeting concerning that topic. Accordingly, this office took no further action

App.

to authorize a request for mediation as an alternative to the negotiations it had been conducting

authorization of mediation was merely a step towards reaching final action on the union' s
contract.

The Board acknowledged that it had discussed

the process for filling the new vacancies but contended that it took no final action:
The remainder. of this Board Workshop involved only
discussion by the Board ( except to appoint a Chair pro tempore).
No vote was taken by the Board to accept the resignations.of the
two Trustees and no vote was taken by the Board to approve a
process to fill the new board vacancies. The Board did discuss

The Board asserted that it had previously decided on a process to fill a vacancy left by another
trustee and therefore its August 25, 2015, discussion " simply reflected the Board' s desire to use
that same process for the newly created vacancies that evening, and to include candidates who
9
applied for the first vacancy in the pool for the new vacancies."
Additionally, the Board argued
that it could not have " accepted"

In reply,
disputed the Board' s assertion that it did not take any
action to approve a process for filling the vacancies left by the two trustees who resigned. She
argued, in pertinent part:

The dialogue that took place among the [ College' s] Board,

was, in part, related to the methodology to be used to fill two
unexpected" vacancies on the [ College' s] Board that occurred at

the August 25, 2015 workshop. * * *

This office agrees that because the trustees' resignations were final at the time that

they were announced during the meeting, the Board did not take final action as to their Board
membership. In addition, the available information indicates that the Board took only a

preliminary step towards filling the vacancies during its August 25, 2015, Workshop meeting
than final

rather

action.

Even assuming the Board reached consensus on filling the new

vacancies by using the same method it was using to fill the existing vacancy, the method for
filling the vacancies was only a component of the Board' s process of taking final action on the
appointment of new trustees: Because the Board' s apparent adoption of a recommendation

concerning the method by which to select new trustees did not amount to final action on the
matter of filling the vacancies, this office is unable to conclude that the Board violated section
2. 02( c) of OMA.

The Public Access Counselor has determined that the resolution of this matter

Re:

OMA Request for Review —2018 PAC 50750

and Mr. Meade:

This determination is issued pursuant to section 3. 5( e) of the Open Meetings Act
OMA) ( 5 ILCS 120/ 3. 5(

e) (

West 2016)).

For the reasons discussed below, this office concludes

that the Board of Trustees ( Board) of Pleasant Township ( Township) violated OMA by
prohibiting .a member of the public from addressing the Board during its December 6, 2017,
meeting.

On December 11, 2017,

submitted a Request for Review alleging

that the. Board did not allow him to address it during its December 6, 2017, meeting because he
did

not

fill

out

a

form providing

the topic

he

wished

to

about and

speak

signature.'

On

also alleged that the Board violated OMA by ( 1) not holding a public hearing at the site

of a road closure, and ( 2) commingled a budget hearing with a regularly scheduled meeting. No provision of OMA
requires a. public body to hold a meeting at the site of road closure, nor does OMA govern the commingling of
meetings. To the extent that the Request for Review could be construed to allege .violations of procedures required

by other statutes or rules, those allegations are not subject to review by the Public Access Counselor. See 15 1LCS
205/ 7( c)( 3) ( West 2016) ( limiting the Public Access Counselor' s authority to resolve disputes to alleged violations

of OMA and the Freedom of Information Act ( 5 ILCS 140/ 1 et seq. ( West 2016)).

December 21, 2017, the Public Access Bureau forwarded a copy of the Request for Review to

the Township Supervisor and requested a detailed written response to

allegations,

together with copies of the minutes, any recordings of the meetings, a copy of the Board' s rules

regarding public comment, and the public comment form.
In a letter dated January 16, 2018, the Township' s outside counsel submitted a
written response, on behalf of the Township, and provided the Public Access Bureau with copies

of the agenda and minutes of the Board' s. December 6, 2017, meeting, its rules regarding public
comment, and a copy of the sign -in form from the December 6, 2017, meeting, which contains
an illegible signature and an illegible topic for discussion. The Township' s public comment rules
provide in pertinent part:

1.

Sign in sheet. Any person who wishes to make comment
during the relevant portion of a township meeting must write their
name and the topic of comment on a sheet provided

for that

purpose prior to the meeting. If their name and topic does not
appear on the sheet at the beginning of the meeting they may not
make

any

comment at that

meeting.[

However, such rules must tend to accommodate, rather than to

However, an advance sign up rule that is enforced to prevent a member of

requiring members of the public to sign up to comment five days in advance of meetings, before

comment).

In this instance, the Township's public comment rule requires a member of the
public who wishes to address public officials during an open meeting to write his or her name on
a sign -in sheet at the beginning of the meeting. As written, that portion of the public comment
rules appears to be a reasonable rule which facilitates running a timely and orderly meeting;
knowing how many people wish to speak and in what order to call participants may promote
efficiency. However, the Township provided no information which suggests that the Board used
its sign- up rule to run a timely and orderly meeting; rather the evidence establishes that the
Board used its sign- up rule for the purpose of prohibiting public comment from

Rather than asking the two members of the public if either had signed up to speak,
and if so, allowing that person to address the public officials, the Board simply denied
statutory right to speak because his signature was illegible. The Board did not provide

any information indicating why the need for a legible signature was necessary to promote order
and decorum at the meeting, or to further any other significant governmental interest, especially
when it was readily apparent that
had marked the sign- up sheet. Because the Board
applied its advance sign- up rule in a manner that unreasonably restricted the right to address
public officials, this office concludes that the Board violated section 2. 06( g) of OMA during its
December 6, 2017, meeting.?
In accordance with the conclusions of this letter, the Public Access Bureau

requests that the Board provide an opportunity for the public to address it at all future meetings.
We remind the Board that rules which are used for the purpose of prohibiting public comment
rather than accommodating the right to address public officials impermissibly restrict the public' s
statutory right to address the Board. Many public bodies that use sign -in sheets will also allow
comment

from other members of the public when time permits. This office suggests that the

Board establish a less restrictive policy for public comment.

6Letter from Trygve Thomas Meade to Edie Steinberg, [ Assistant Attorney General,] Office of the
Public Access Counselor ( January 16, 2018), at I .
This determination

is limited to the Board' s denial of an individual' s right to address the Board

pursuant to its rule requiring advance sign- up by a prospective commenter at the start of a meeting; this
determination

does not assess the propriety of the remainder of the Board' s public comment provisions.

However,

we note that requiring a member of the public to set forth the topic of his or her comment in writing in advance of a
meeting may create a chilling effect on speech at public meetings. See III. Att' y Gen. Pub. Acc. Op. No. 14- 009, at 7
a rule requiring members of the public to provide a complete home address prior to speaking would exceed the

scope of rulemaking under section 2. 06( g) because it may have a chilling effect on persons who wish to speak at
public meetings).
Therefore, the Board may wish to review its public comment rules to ensure that they don't
impermissibly

restrict

the public' s statutory

right

to address the Board.

RE:

Dear

OMA Requests for Review — 2018 PAC 52254; 2018 PAC 53194

and Mr. Storino:

This determination letter is issued pursuant to section 3. 5( e) of the Open Meetings
Act ( OMA) ( 5 ILCS

120/ 3. 5(

e) (

West 2016)).

On March 16, 2018,

submitted a Request for Review ( 2018 PAC

52254) to the Public Access Bureau alleging that the Development, Planning, and Zoning
Committee ( Committee) of the City Council of the City of Elmhurst ( City) violated section
2. 06( d)

of

OMA (

5

ILCS 120/ 2. 06( d) ( West 2016)),

which provides:

Each public body shall periodically, but no less than semiannually, meet to review minutes of all closed meetings.

At such

meetings a determination shall be made, and reported in an open

session that ( 1) the need for confidentiality still exists as to all or
part of those minutes or ( 2) that the minutes or portions thereof no

longer require confidential treatment and are available for public

inspection. The failure of a public body to strictly comply with the

than a proceeding involving an,alleged violation of this Act, if the
public body, within 60 days of discovering its failure to strictly
comply with the technical requirements of this subsection, reviews
the closed session minutes and determines and thereafter reports in
open session that either ( 1) the need for confidentiality still exists
as to all or part of the minutes or verbatim record, or ( 2) that the
minutes or recordings or portions thereof no longer require
confidential treatment and are available for public inspection.
l stated that he had submitted a Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA)

request to the City seeking a copy of the minutes of the most recent meeting in which the
Committee had performed a review of its closed session minutes. He stated that on March 14,

2018, the City had responded that it had no responsive documents. This office forwarded a copy
of the Request for Review to the Committee and its counsel responded that " we have not been
able

to determine Committee compliance with

annual

review

of

its

closed session

minutes on

section

2. 06( d)" of OMA but had placed the semi-

its April 9, 2018, meeting

agenda.

l

replied that during that meeting, the Committee had voted to approve the closed session minutes
from 2017 rather than to keep them confidential.

On May 17, 2018

l submitted a subsequent Request for Review (2018

PAC 53194) following up on 2018 PAC 52254 by alleging that the Committee had since failed
to perform a semi- annual review of the closed session minutes of four meetings ( May 22, 2017,

June 26, 2017, July 10, 2017, and August 14, 2017) within 60 days of discovering on March 14,
2018, that it had not strictly complied with section 2. 06(d) of OMA. Discussing his allegations
concerning several committees at once, he contended:
The committees finally scheduled meetings on May 14,
2018 to review many ( but not all) of the closed session minutes.
However, I argue that they missed the deadline. The committees
should have reviewed their closed session minutes within 60 day

of March 14, 2018. This deadline would have been May 13, 2018.
Since the committees conducted no such review and determination

in open session by that date, then I believe that OMA has been
violated.

On March 30, 2018, and June 5, 2018, this office forwarded copies of the

Requests for Review to the Committee and asked it to address whether it had met the
requirements of section 2. 06( d) of OMA.

On April 6, 2018, and June 12, 2018, this office

received the Committee' s written responses to the two matters and copies of the Committee' s

April 9, 2018, and May 14, 2018, meeting agendas and minutes. On April 24, 2018, and June

sent follow- up correspondence on July 4, 2018.
In its June 12, 2018, response to this office, the Committee contended that it had

discovered that it had not reviewed its 2017 closed session meeting minutes at its public

meeting on April 9, 2018, when there were Agenda items for the Committee to approve its
closed session meeting minutes from [ the four meetings in question]

The Committee stated that it

subsequently discussed and voted in open session at its May 14, 2018, meeting to find that the

need for confidentiality still existed for the closed session minutes of the four meetings. The
Committee disputed
claim regarding when it learned of the violation, arguing, in
relevant part: "
The City' s FOIA Officer is not the Committee and is not a member of the
Committee. As such, the Committee did not discover its failure to strictly comply with Section
2. 06( d) of OMA on March 14, 2018, when the City' s FOIA Officer responded to
FOIA

request."

In reply to that response,

moved up the alleged date of the Committee' s

to March 1, 2018.

He provided this office with a copy of a March 1,

In this matter, this office is likewise unable to establish, based on the information

submitted by both parties, the date on which the Committee or its attorneys became aware that

the Committee had not performed a semi- annual review of its closed session minutes. The City' s
March 14, 2018, response to

FOIA request and the City' s preparation of that response

do not demonstrate that the Committee and/ or its attorneys learned of the lack of review on
March 1, 2018, or March 14, 2018. Rather, it appears that the Committee and/ or its attorneys

may have learned of the alleged violation upon receipt of this office' s inquiry letter in 2018 PAC

which was

sent

by

regular

mail

on

March 30, 2018.

Accordingly, this office cannot

conclude that the Committee violated. section 2. 06( d) of OMA by failing to review the closed
session minutes within 60 days of discovering its initial violation. 6

Even assuming that this office found that the Committee failed to review its closed session

minutes within 60 days of discovering its technical violation, no remedial action is necessary. This office' s review
of the Committee' s May 14, 2018, meeting minutes confirmed that the Committee subsequently performed a review
of the closed session minutes at issue. Further, this office has previously concluded that OMA does not require a

public body to remedy a failure to review closed session minutes within 60 days of discovering:a technical violation
of section 2. 06( d) by releasing all of its unreviewed minutes. See 111. Att'y Gen. PAC Req. Rev, Ltr. 52812, issued

On. May 9, 2018, this office forwarded a copy of the Request for Review to the
Committee and asked it to address whether it had met the requirements of section 2. 06( d) of

OMA. On May 24, 2018, this office received a written response and additional materials from
the Committee' s April 9, 2018, May 14, 2018, and upcoming May 29, 2018, meetings. On May

the confidentiality of its September 25, 2017, closed session minutes at its May 14, 2018,

planned to review whether those minutes should remain confidential at its May 29, 2018,

While the April 9, 2018, e- mail exchange between

suggests that the Committee became aware of the issue regarding the closed session minutes
around that time rather than on the date of the Committee' s receipt of this Request for Review, it
appears that the Committee performed a' review of the closed session minutes of the three

meetings within 60 days of that e- mail exchange.

This office' s review of the Committee' s May

14, 2018, meeting minutes and May 29, 2018, meeting agenda indicated that the Committee

completed its semi- annual review of the closed session minutes at issue. Accordingly, although
the Committee did not timely perform a semi- annual review of all its closed session minutes as
required under section 2. 06( d) of OMA, this office is unable to conclude that the Committee

failed to remedy that violation within 60 days of discovering its non- compliance.

Even if the Committee had not reviewed all of its closed session minutes within 60 days of

discovering the technical violation, this office has previously concluded that OMA does not require a public body to
remedy a failure to review closed session minutes within 60 days of discovering a technical violation of section
2. 06( d) by releasing all of its unreviewed minutes. See 111. Att'y Gen. PAC Req. Rev. Ltr. 52812, issued August 28,

RE:

OMA Request for Review — 2019 PAC 56688

Dear Mr. Loging:.•
On February 5, 2019, the Public Access Bureau received your Request for Review
in which you allege that the Village of Cambridge Board of Trustees ( Board) violated the Open
Meetings

Act ( OMA) ( 5 1LCS 120/ 1

et

in connection with its November 27,

2017, meeting.
Section 3. 5(

a)

of

OMA ( 5 ILCS 120/ 3. 5(

a) (

West

2016)) provides, in pertinent

part:

A person who believes that a violation of this. Act by a
public body has occurred. may file 'a request for review with the

Public Access Counselor established in the Office of the Attorney
General not later than 60 days after the alleged violation. If facts

concerning the violation are not discovered within the 60 -day
period, but are discovered at a later date, not exceeding 2 years
after the alleged violation, by a person utilizing reasonable
diligence, the request for review may be made within 60 days of
the discovery of the alleged violation.

Your Request for Review alleges that the Board violated OMA during its
November 27, 2017, meeting by discussing an item during closed session that was not listed on
the meeting agenda. You submitted your Request for Review more than 60 days after the date of

that alleged violation, and you have not asserted or provided any facts indicating that you did not

diligence. •

Because you did not submit your Request for Review before the statutory period for
doing so expired, this office lacks authority to review your allegations concerning the November
27, 2017, meeting.
However, this office has previously concluded that OMA does not require a

public body to list a closed session on its agenda. III. Att'y Gen. PAC Rev. Ltr. 26777, issued
April 2, 2015.

Section 2a

of

OMA ( 5 ILCS 120/ 2a ( West 2016))

provides: "[

aJt any open

meeting of a public body for which proper notice under this Act has been given, the body may,
without additional notice under Section 2. 02, hold a closed meeting in accordance with this Act."

The Illinois Appellate Court has held that the " plain language of section 2a allows a public body
to decide during a properly noticed open meeting to go into closed session without any additional
notice."

Wyman

v.

Schweighart, 385 I11. App. 3d, 10.99, 1107 ( 4th Dist. 2008).

Because OMA

does not require a public body to provide any notice. on its agenda of a closed session, it follows
that a public body is not required to list on its agenda all topics that it might discuss during a
closed

session.

Accordingly,

this

file is

closed.

On January 28, 2019, you submitted a Request for Review to the Public Access

by holding an improper closed meeting to discuss the Village's tax levy ordinance at some point
prior

to the

Board' s December 18, 2018,

special

meeting.'

You explained that the Board took

final action on the tax levy at its December 18, 2018, special meeting, but had never previously
discussed

during

the subject

an open

meeting.

2 You assert that none of the Board or Committee

of the Whole ( Committee) agendas or meeting minutes for the year of 2018 mention the tax levy.
You also allege that the subject matter of the tax levy had previously been included on the

Your Request for Review alleges the relevant special meeting occurred on December 12, 2018.

However, according to the Board' s agenda, which is available on the Village' s website, this special meeting occurred
on December 18, 2018. See Village of Riverdale, Special Board Meeting of the Board of Trustees, Agenda Item V.

Your Request for Review does not allege that the Board failed to take action openly in connection
with the tax levy, which was an agenda item and"the subject of final action at the December 18, 2018, special
meeting.

To the extent that the Board may have merely discussed the issue of the annual

Under OMA, deliberations among a majority of a quorum of the members of a

OMA ( 5 ILCS 120/ 2( c) ( West 2017 Supp.), as amended by Public Act 100- 646, effective July

OMA generally does not govern one- on- one conversations between a

mayor and an alderman. Nonetheless, it is conceivable that conversations among less than a

relaying various positions among aldermen to each other in a deliberative manner that could have
risen to the level of "contemporaneous interactive communication" among a majority of a
of the
quorum
City Council. Although you stated that you regularly attend City Council
meetings and that the purchase had never been discussed during any meeting, there are multiple
ways in which the City could have considered the possibility of the purchase prior to the January
21, 2019, meeting without violating OMA. For example, City staff members could have
discussed the matter among themselves or with just the mayor or with the mayor and a couple of
aldermen.
Additionally, the City Council could have discussed the matter in closed session
under the section 2( c)( 5) exception to the general requirement to conduct business openly. See 5
1LCS 120/ 2( c)( 5) ( West 2017 Supp.), as amended by Public Act 100- 646, effective July 27, 2018
permitting a public body to discuss in closed session: " The purchase or lease of real property
for the use of the public body, including meetings held for the purpose of discussing whether a
particular parcel should be acquired.").

Because your Request for Review does not provide a basis from which this office

could conclude that the City Council violated OMA in connection with the land purchase it
approved
during its January 21, 2019, meeting, the Public Access Bureau has determined that no
further action is warranted in this matter.

and to address the Board, but did not violate OMI by prohibiting

from

On July 24, 2018, the Public Acce9s Bureau received a Request for Review from

alleging that the Board had discriminai ed against him at it July 23, 2018, meeting

because it did not grant his e- mailed request to mdke public comment after it had permitted

Trustee Carballo to comment by telephone at the ame meeting. In particular,

stated

that he was viewing the meeting remotely and sent e- mails to the Village manager and to all of
the Board members requesting the opportunity to omment by telephone because Trustee

Carballo

had

made " public

stated that a member of the Board

publicly acknowledged his request to comment, blit he was not permitted to do so.

b) If a member wishes to attend a meeting by other means, the
member must notify the recording secretary or clerk of the public

body before the meeting unless ad ance notice is impractical.
c) A majority ofthe public body may allow a member to attend
a meeting by other means only in accordance with and to the
extent allowed by rules adopted by the public body. The rules must
conform to the requirements and rFstrictions of this. Section, may

further limit the extent to which attendance by other means is
allowed; and may provide for the iftving of additional notice to the

Emphasis

Under the plain language of these provisions, a public body with a quorum physically present has

the discretion to permit a. member who is not phylically present to participate in the meeting by
audio or video conference for any of the three re4ons set forth in section 7( a) of OMA and in
accordance with its rules for attendance by other means.

The Board provided this office with a copy of its ordinance adopting procedures
for electronic attendance at meetings, Ordinance ± 007- 4117, adopted June 4, 2007. The Board' s
rules state that a member that meets the one of the three reasons for being unable to physically
attend the' meeting " should notify the Village Clerk at least 24 hours before the meeting,. unless
impractical,

so

that

necessary

communications

equipment can

be

arranged."'

The rules set forth

the following procedures for permitting a person o attend electronically:

1

After establishing that a quorum is physically present at a meeting
where a member of the Village de ires to attend electronically, the
presiding officer shall state that ( i) a notice was received by a
member of the Village in accords ce with these Rules, and ( ii) the

member will be deemed authorize to attend the meeting
electronically

unless , a motion obj cting to the member' s electronic

attendance is made, seconded and pproved by two- thirds of the
members of the Village. l21

The Board's response to this office acknowledges that Trustee Carballo was not eligible to attend

the July 23, 2018, meeting by audio conference because he did not meet any of the requirements

of section 7( a) of OMA. Indeed, this office' s review of the video recording of the meeting
indicates that the Board questioned Trustee Carb llo about the reasons for his not being able to
attend the meeting in person and discussed whethr he was eligible to attend the meeting by
audio conference. A motion was made during the meeting to allow Trustee Carballo to attend
the meeting by audio conference but was not seco1nded by another trustee on the Board.

Trustee Carballo was not authorized t participate in the meeting electronically.

a motion to allow Trustee Carballo

to make

comments as a member of the public. Trustee Carballo subsequently participated through the
Board member only audio connection during public comment periods and made multiple
additional

requests

to comment

throughout

the

meting.

Because Trustee Carballo is, in fact, an

elected official and Board member, and not a member of the public during Board meetings, he

should riot have been allowed to participate electrpnically during the public comment portion of
the meeting. By doing so Trustee Carballo was irpproperly attending the meeting remotely,
notwithstanding that it was clear he was not eligible to attend under the circumstances of his
absence.

Although the Board attempted to limit Trustee Carballo' s comments at the

meeting to the same length of comments that a member of the public who was present at the
meeting would be allowed to make and did not a1liow him to vote, OMA does not distinguish

between a member of the public body attending die meeting by other means as a member of the

section

of

OMA.

Therefore, the

Board' s vote to allow Trustee Carballo to participate in the meeting as a member of the public
instead of as a member of the Board is a distinction that is not supported by OMA. Moreover,

Trustee Carballo' s direct connection to the Board hat allowed him to participate in the meeting
utilized the audio conference equipment set up by the Board for the exclusive use of members of

the Board who were not physically present and approved to attend the meeting. His participation
in the meeting after the Board declined to
approvl his request to attend electronically constituted
attendance

at

the

meeting.

It is undisputed that T ustee Carballo was ineligible to attend the

meeting by audio conference. Thus, the Board vi fated sections 7( a) and 7( c) of OMA, by
allowing Trustee Carballo to attend its July 23, 2018, meeting remotely.

This determination letter is issued pursuant to section 3. 5( e) of the Open Meetings
Act (OMA) ( 5 ILCS 120/ 3. 5(

e) (

West 2016)).

On January 20, 2016, Mr. Steven E. Glink submitted a Request for Review
alleging that the Board of Education ( Board) of Itasca School District 10 ( District) violated
OMA on January 6, 2016, by meeting " in secret" with the Superintendentof the District to
discuss the disciplinary action of a student, and without providing notice of such a meeting.' On
February 11, 2016, Mr. Brian P. Crowley, counsel for the Board, submitted a written response to
this office on the Board' s behalf, asserting that on January 6, 2016, the Superintendent discussed
a student disciplinary matter with one Board member, Ms. Drew -Shaw. The Board also

provided this office an affidavit of Ms. Drew -Shaw, who averred that on January 6, 2016, she
discussed a student disciplinary matter with the Superintendent, and that no other Board

members were present during this discussion. In his reply, Mr. Glink asserted that Board
member Shaw and her husband told his clients that the full .Board attended the gathering.

In order for the requirements

of OMA to

apply, a gathering must constitute a " meeting" as defined by section 1. 02 of OMA ( 5 ILCS

without limitation, electronic mail, electronic chat, and instant
messaging),

or other means of contemporaneous

communication, of a majority of a quorum of the members of a

public body held for the purpose of discussing public business[.]

The allegation that the Board held an improper meeting on January 6, 2016, to
discuss the discipline of a student appears to be based solely on alleged statements that Mr.
Glink' s clients attributed to a Board member and her spouse.

That Board member provided an

affidavit that expressly denies such an improper meeting occurred. Accordingly, this office is
unable to conclude from the available information that the Board held an improper " meeting" on
January 6, 2016, which was subject to the requirements of OMA.

the

counsel

noted: "

does not appear to allege any facts that indicate that the Board failed to post an

agenda for the June 21, 2016, meeting; rather she seems to allege that the Board did not post

notice specifically for the interfund transfer." 2 Indeed, although it was somewhat unclear,
Request for Review appears to have alleged that the District did not provide notice

of the inter -fund transfer, rather than notice of the June 21, 2016, Board meeting in general.
OMA does not set forth specific requirements for notice of a meeting in which a board of
education votes on an inter -fund transfer; rather, a public body that intends to vote on an inter fund transfer resolution during a meeting simply must set forth the general subject matter of that
resolution

RE:

OMA Request for Review — 2019 PAC 56709

Dear

On February 5, 2019, the Public Access. Bureau received your Request for Review

in which you allege that the Pleasant Plains Community Unit School District No. 8 ( District)
Board

of

Education ( Board)

violated the

Open Meetings Act ( OMA) ( 5 ILCS 120/ 1

et

by approving an intergovernmental agreement ( agreement) outside of an open meeting.
Specifically, you allege that the Board listed the approval of the agreement on the

agenda for its June 25, 2018, regular meeting, and you have obtained a copy of the June 25,
2018,

executed agreement (

date-

stamped

June 28, 2018),

but the minutes of the June 25, 2018,

Board meeting do not include any reference to the agreement. Therefore, you contend that the

have

taken

final

action outside of an open

meeting

to approve the agreement.

You

have asked this office to review the verbatim recordings of the Board' s May 21, 2018, closed
session, during which the agreement was discussed, and the Board' s June 25, 2018, closed
session. You also requested a review of the verbatim recordings of those closed sessions " for

As a threshold matter, this office notes that the minutes of the Board' s June 25,

The claims in your Request for Review concern an action that allegedly should have been
included in the Board' s. meeting minutes more than 60 days before you filed your Request for
Review. Although your Request for Review included copies of responses to Freedom of

Information Act ( FOIA) requests you received in January 2019, you have not asserted that
despite using reasonable diligence, you did not discover the alleged violation within 60 days of
its occurrence.
Further, it appears that a person using reasonable diligence would have
discovered within 60 days that the agreement item that appeared on the agenda for the June 25,
2018, meeting was not included in the June 25, 2018, meeting minutes, as those minutes were
approved at the July 23, 2018, Board meeting4 and were required to have been available to the
public

Likewise,

a person

using reasonable diligence would have recognized that the June 25, 2018, minutes initially
posted to the Board' s website were incorrect, as many agenda items were missing and the
information regarding the Board' s votes that carried over between pages appeared to be
repetitive. Further, the executive session minutes you recently obtained pursuant to a FOIA
request were not necessary to discover the omission of the approval of the agreement on the June

25, 2018, meeting minutes.

RE: OMA Request for Review — 2019 PAC 56777
Dear

This determination letter is issued pursuant to section 3. 5( b)' of the Open Meetings
Act ( OMA) ( 5

For the reasons set forth below, the Public Access

Bureau concludes that no further action in this matter is warranted.

On February 8, 2019, you submitted a Request for Review alleging that the
Mayor of the City of Waukegan, the Honorable Sam Cunningham, violated OMA in connection
with several City Council meetings; February 4, 2019, is the only meeting date you specifically
identified.

In general terms, you referenced the right to address public officials pursuant to

2. 06( g)

of

OMA ( 5 ILCS

1 and certain types of speech that,

according to you, are not protected by the first amendment to the United States Constitution.
You did not, however, set forth facts with respect to how Mayor Cunningham

or the rest of the

City Council allegedly violated OMA. For instance, you did not describe any particular
instances in which Mayor Cunningham or the City Council improperly restricted public

comment by a member of the public. Although you stated that you had attached a detailed listing
of each incident and violation, your e- mail included no such attachment.

This office notified you

of that fact by e- mail on February 11, 2019, but has not heard back.

and Ms. Dodson:

This determination is issued pursuant to section 3. 5( e) of the Open Meetings Act
OMA) ( 5 ILCS 120/ 3. 5(

e) (

West 2016)).

For the reasons explained below, the Public Access

Bureau concludes that the City of Bloomington City Council ( Council) did not violate OMA by
holding improper meetings or taking final action via e- mail on September 20, 2012, and October
17, 2012. Although significant time has passed since. this OMA dispute arose, this letter is

issued to provide guidance concerning private communications involving members of a public

that the City manager, who is not a member of the Council, invited the Council to deliberate on
these issues:

That

The Council' s response further asserted that there was no contemporaneous interactive

communication about public business among a majority of a quorum of members because the
four Council members who responded to the City manager' s e- mails responded directly to the
City manager, not to the other members of the Council.
Section 2( a)

of

OMA ( 5 ILCS 120/ 2(

a) (

West 2012)) provides that " all meetings

The Public Access Bureau has deterinined that " contemporaneous interactive communication"

Att' y Gen. PAC Req. Rev. Ltr. 39667, issued February 18, 2016, at 3.
The Council is comprised of nine aldermen and the City' s mayor. Thus, if four
members, a majority of a quorum, of the Council engaged in contemporaneous, interactive,
deliberative

discussions

requirements

of public business via e- mail, then the procedural

safeguards

and

of OMA would have applied.

With respect to the City manager' s September 20, 2012, e- mail, four members of
the Council responded

between September

20, 2012, and September

25, 2012.

Their responses

were either directly to other members of the Councilor copied to other members of the Council.
However, all four responses were separated too far in time to constitute " contemporaneous"

interactive communications. Similarly, four members of the Council responded to the City
manager' s

October 17, 2012,

e- mail

between October 17, 2012,

and

October 23, 2012.

Those

responses, however, were sent directly to the City manager and were not copied to other
members
of the Council.
Such communications did not involve a majority of a quorum of the
Council and also were separated too far in time to be contemporaneous.

Further, although the e-

mails express a minority of the Council members' opinions and/ or preferences, those expressions

do not reflect final actions by the Council concerning the issues raised by the City manager.
Accordingly, this office concludes that the e- mails at issue did not constitute meetings of the

Council or final actions by the Council in violation of OMA.
Although this office recognizes that it is sometimes necessary for members of a
public body to communicate with one another between meetings, e- mails concerning public

business which are sent to or received by a majority of a quorum skirt the purpose of OMA, 3 and.
have the potential to violate OMA. We therefore caution the members of the Council to be

mindful of the requirements of OMA, as well as the public policy favoring the open discussion

of matters affecting the public interest, before engaging in such e- mail communications.

3Section 1 of OMA ( 5 ILCS 120/ 1 ( West 2014)) provides that " it is the intent of this Act to
ensure

that the actions of public bodies be taken
openly and that their deliberations

be

conducted

openly." •

of the people' s business, and that the intent of the Act is to assure that agency actions be taken
openly and that their deliberations be conducted openly." Gosnell v, Hogan, 179 111. App. 3d

As a preliminary matter, the Board' s response asserts that " Mr. Kraft does not

House Bill No. 4630, at 81.
Board Member' s Access to Closed Session Verbatim Recordings
In the non -confidential version of its answer, the Board explained that one of its

members, Mr. Jed Earnest, had recently made several requests to listen to various closed session
verbatim
recordings.
According to the Board, " Mr. Earnest was informed that he may listen to
the recordings. All that he needs to do is schedule a time to meet with the Superintendent in the

District' s main office so the recordings can be ready and they can listen to the recordings together
Section 2. 06( e)."
The Board further described its handling of Mr. Earnest's requests

pursuant to

as follows:

After making his first request, Mr. Earnest listened to the
requested

recording in

accordance. with

section

2. 06(

e).

On March

14, 2018, Mr. Earnest went to the District office to listen to the

September 22, 2016, closed session recording, as was previously
scheduled between him and the Superintendent. _ On that same day,
he requested to also listen to the August 2016 closed session
recording. Superintendent Johnson was not able to listen to the

recordings with Mr. Earnest due to scheduling conflicts and the
recordings not being ready. Accordingly, Superintendent Johnson
asked Mr..Earnest to make an appointment. to come back to the

District office to listen to the August 2016 recording.
Superintendent Johnson is in the process of scheduling times with
Mr. Earnest for when he may come to the office to listen to this
recording and the other requested recordings. t31

member to be at the whim of a board' s attorney or at the whim of the employee of the board,
before said board member can listen to the recordings. i5
The Board' s response to this office confirmed that Mr. Earnest accessed a.

requested • closed session verbatim recording during a scheduled appointment with
Superintendent Johnson. In addition, the Board asserted that, at the time of its response to this

office, Mr. Earnest and Superintendent Johnson were in the process of scheduling a second
appointment to access a separate referenced recording. The plain language of section 2. 06( e)

does not address the specific timing of access by a Board member, but, contrary to Mr. Kraft' s
argument, does provide that access shall be granted in the presence of an administrative

official

of the publicbody or certain other personnel. This, section 2. 06( e) necessarily contemplates that
a closed session verbatim recording may not be immediately available to a Board member, as
arrangements must be made for appropriate oversight. This office has not received any evidence
that Mr. Earnest was denied the opportunity to access any closed session verbatim recordings
within
the meaning of section 2. 06( e),
whether through outright refusal or a delay so
unreasonable

that it effectively

recordings

The plain language of the opening sentence of section 2. 06( e) of OMA makes
clear that the provision prohibits public inspection of a closed session verbatim recording that a
public body has not elected to disclose. Thus, on its face, section 2. 06( e) of OMA does not
restrict limited access by appropriate school personnel to facilitate a board member' s request. As

noted above, the plain language of section 2. 06( e) also expressly allows a records secretary, an
administrative official of the public body, or any elected official of the public body to listen to
the closed session verbatim recording with the board member who has requested access, further
signaling that section 2. 06( e) of OMA is not aimed at prohibiting disclosure to appropriate
school personnel involved in facilitating access to a recording. Moreover, even if the language
of section 2. 06( e) could be construed as restricting access of school personnel to closed session
recordings, the legislative history set out above demonstrates that the intent of Public Act 99- 515
was to ensure that newly elected or appointed members of public bodies have access to past .
closed session verbatim recordings and minutes, rather than to prevent an IT employee from

facilitating a board member' s review. Construing the enacted provision as a whole, it is also
more reasonable to infer that the prohibition on recording or removing closed session verbatim

recordings was intended to apply to elected or appointed officials who have the statutory right to
access them, rather than to infer that the General Assembly' s intent was to prohibit a public body

from 'providing a closed session verbatim recording to its attorney for the purpose of securing
legal

advice.

Therefore, Mr. Kraft' s

allegations

that

the

Board

violated

OMA

by

allegedly

copying the recording for a District attorney and by allowing access to an IT employee and the

District's superintendent are unavailing.
With respect to Mr. Kraft' s allegation that the Board improperly removed one or
more closed session verbatim recordings from the District' s main office or official storage

location, the Board' s confidential affidavit set forth information sufficient to demonstrate that the
Board did not violate the requirements of section 2. 06( e) of OMA.
The Public Access Counselor has determined that resolution of this matter does

not require the issuance of a binding opinion. This letter serves to close this matter. If you have

RE:

OMA Request for Review — 2018 PAC 56228

Dear Ms. Williams and Mr. Burford:

This determination is issued pursuant to section 3. 5( e) of the Open Meetings Act
OMA) ( 5 ILCS 120/ 3. 5(

e) (

West 2016)).

For the reasons that follow, the Public Access Bureau

concludes that the Riverdale Public Library District Board of Trustees ( Board) did not violate the
requirements of OMA when it allowed Trustee Maurice Roberts to attend its November 1, 2018, •
meeting by telephone.
On December 24, 2018, the Public Access Bureau received a Request for Review

from Ms. Vickie Williams alleging that the Board had violated OMA when it permitted Trustee
Roberts to attend the November 1, 2018, meeting when there was not a quorum of the Board
physically present at the location of the meeting.

Ms. Williams' Request for Review also contained an allegation that the Board
violated OMA at its October 22, 2018, meeting that she attended. Because section 3. 5( a) of

concerning the October 22, 2018, meeting. , •

On December 31, 2018, the Public Access Bureau sent a ,copy of the Request for
Review to the Board and asked it to respond to Ms. Williams' allegation. that the Board

improperly allowed Trustee Roberts to attend its November 1, 2018, meeting when a quorum of
the Board was not physically present. This office also requested that the Board identify the
particular

reason

that

Trustee Roberts

from physically

In

addition, this office requested that the Board provide a copy of the agenda and minutes of the
meeting for our review. On January 9, 2019, the Board provided this office with a written •
answer along with copies of the agenda and minutes of the November, 1, 2018, meeting. On

According to the information in the by- laws and the minutes of the November , 1 , 2018, meeting,

In addition, the Board provided this office with information concerning the reason
Trustee Roberts was not physically present at the meeting: Trustee Roberts stated his employer .

to attend the November 1, 2018; meeting due to his employment, which; is a permissiblereason

for a public body to allow amember to participate by other means under, section 7( a) of OMA ( 5
a).( West 2017 Supp.)).
Because a quorum' of the Board was physically present at

ILCS 120/ 7(

the location of the meeting and because Trustee Roberts was prevented from physically attending
the meeting because of his 'employment, the Board did not violate section 7 of.OMA when it
permitted Trustee -Roberts to attend. the meeting by telephone conference.

RE:

OMA Request for Review —2015 PAC 37389

Dear

and Mr. McCall:

This determination is issued pursuant to section 3. 5( e) of the Open Meetings Act
OMA) ( 5 ILCS 120/ 3. 5(

e) (

On September

West 2016)).

10, 2015,

submitted a Request for Review

to the Public Access Bureau alleging that Mayor Curtis McCall, Jr., and four trustees on the
Village of Cahokia ( Village) Board of Trustees ( Board) had failed to complete the OMA

electronic training curriculum as required by the statute. She also alleged that the village clerk
and deputy village clerk had failed to complete the same curriculum. On September 23, 2015,
this office sent a copy of the. Request for Review to the Village and asked it to respond to

allegations, but this office has no record of receiving a response from the Village.
Under

section

1.

05( b)

of

OMA ( 5 ILCS 120/ 1; 05( b) ( West 2016)),

all the

members of a public body must complete the approximately hour- long electronic training
curriculum developed by the Public Access Counselor. In this case, that means that Mayor

McCall and the Village' s trustees must each complete the electronic training curriculum. Section

Except as otherwise provided in this Section, each elected

or appointed member of a public body subject to this Act who
becomes such a member after [ January 1, 2012,] shall successfully
complete the electronic training curriculum developed and
administered by the Public Access Counselor. For these members,
the training must be completed not later than the 90th day after the
date the member:
1)

takes the oath of office, if the member is required to

take an oath of office to assume the person' s duties

as a member of the public body; or
2)

otherwise assumes responsibilities

as a member of

the public body, if the member is not required to
take an oath of office to assume the person' s duties

as a member of the governmental body.
Each member successfully completing the electronic
training curriculum shall file a copy of the certificate of completion

with the public body.
Completing the required training as a member of the public
body satisfies the requirements of this Section with regard. to the
member' s service on a committee or subcommittee of the public

body and the member' s ex officio service on any other public body.

An elected or appointed member of a public body subject to
this Act who has successfully completed the training required
under this subsection ( b) and filed a copy of the certificate of

completion with the public body is not required to subsequently
complete the training required under this subsection ( b). .

Under the plain language of this provision, members of a public body generally need to complete
the electronic training curriculum only once, rather than annually. However, section 1. 05( a) of
OMA ( 5 ILCS 120/ 1. 05(
personnel

to take the

a) (

OMA

West 2016))
electronic

requires each public body to designate at least some

training

curriculum

annually:

 The Honorable Curtis McCall, Jr.

February 21, 2019
Page 3

Every public body shall designate employees, officers, or
members to receive training on compliance with this Act. Each

public body shall submit a list of designated employees, officers,
or members to the Public Access Counselor. Within 6 months after

January

1, 2010,], the designated

employees,

officers, and

members must successfully complete an electronic training

curriculum, developed and administered by the Public Access
Counselor, and thereafter must successfully complete an annual
training program. Thereafter, whenever a public body designates
an additional employee, officer, or member to receive this training,
that person must successfully complete the electronic training
curriculum .within 30 days after that designation

Thus, if the clerk and deputy clerk have been appointed OMA designees, they must complete the
OMA electronic training curriculum annually. Otherwise, because they are not members of the

Board, they are not required to complete the OMA electronic training curriculum at all.
It is undisputed that members of the Board, including Mayor McCall, had not
completed the OMA electronic training curriculum as of the date of the submission of

Request for Review. This office requests that the Village promptly ensure that all
members of the Board, including Mayor McCall, complete the OMA electronic training
curriculum if they have not already done so. This office further advises the Village, if it has not

already done so, to designate personnel to take the OMA electronic training curriculum annually,
and to ensure that those individuals in fact complete the electronic training curriculum annually.
The Public Access Counselor has determined that resolution of this matter does

not require the issuance of a binding opinion. This letter serves to close this matter. If you have
any questions, please contact me at ( 312) 814- 8413, jjones@atg. state. il. us, or the Chicago

The available information suggests that the Staff Committee is distinguishable from the RSB

Committee and other standing committees of the University Council. The Staff Committee appears to be intended
to assist the president rather than to formally serve a public body. See Pope v. Parkinson, 48 111. App. 3d 797 ( 4th
Dist. 1977) ( committee appointed by university chancellor to advise chancellor and director of university' s
basketball arena on issues related to the arena was not subject to OMA because committee solely advised university
administrators and served at pleasure of chancellor, rather than being accountable to any public body).

OMA Request for Review — 2019 PAC 56894

Dear

This determination is issued pursuant to section 3. 5( b) of the Open Meetings Act
OMA) ( 5 ILCS 120/ 3. 5( b) ( West 2016)).

For the reasons set forth below, the information you

have furnished provides no basis for the Public Access Counselor to conclude that the Village of
Lincolnwood ( Village) violated OMA.

Your Request for Review states that Sy Property 3701 LLC owns a piece of

property located in Lincolnwood and that " no representative of Sy Property 3701 LLC has ever
attended any Village meeting of Lincolnwood thereby allowing SyI Property 3701 LLC to act as

a

legal '

shell'

of

company

the property'

s

current occupant

AT& T."

You then appear to allege

that this constitutes a, violation of OMA by the Village.

Among other things, OMA generally requires public bodies to conduct public
business openly ( 5 ILCS 120/ 2( a) ( West 2017 Supp.),

July

effective

27, 2018),

provide advance

approve minutes of meetings (

as amended by Public. Act 100- 646,

notice of meetings ( 5

ILCS 120/ 2. 02 ( West 2016)),

5 ILCS 120/ 2. 06( b) ( West 2016)).

No provisions

and

of OMA,

however, require a representative of a private company to attend a meeting of a public body or
obligate a public

body

to make

findings

about an

entity'

s corporate

identity.

Because your

Request for Review does not provide a summary of facts from which this office could conclude
that any public body of the Village violated OMA, we have determined that no further action is
warranted

as to this matter.

RE: OMA Request for Review — 2019 PAC 56890

Dear Mr. Rivera:

This determination is issued pursuant to section 3. 5( b) of the Open Meetings Act
OMA) ( 5 ILCS 120/ 3. 5( b) ( West 2016)).

For the reasons set forth below, the information you

have furnished provides no basis for the Public Access Counselor to conclude that the Waukegan

Community Unit School District # 60 Board of Education ( School Board) violated OMA.
Your Request for Review alleges that the District's superintendent violated OMA
in connection with the School Board' s February 13, 2019, meeting
by sending an " email of the
I

You provided a copy of an e- mail

that the superintendent sent to the mayor of Waukegan and School Board members describing a
discussion held during a portion of the meeting and referencing an attached copy of an audio

recording of the discussion. In a telephone conversation with an Assistant Attorney General in

the Public Access Bureau, you clarified that you are alleging that the superintendent improperly
disclosed meeting minutes prior to approval by the School Board by disseminating these
materials.

However,

the superintendent'

OMA Request for Review —2019 PAC 56906

RE:

Dear

This determination

is issued pursuant to section 3. 5( b) of the Open Meetings

OMA) ( 5 ILCS 120/ 3. 5( b) ( West 2016)).

Act

For the reasons set forth below, the Public Access

Bureau has determined that no further action is warranted in this matter.

On February 19, 2019, this office received your Request for Review alleging that
the Village of Glenwood ( Village) Board of Trustees ( Board) violated the requirements of OMA

in connection with a prospective development. Specifically, you provided this office with two
sets of e- mails pertaining to a power plant project proposed by Advanced Power/ Oak Meadow
Energy ( Advanced Power) and asked this office to investigate the Board' s OMA compliance in
connection with those communications. You referred this office to a specific portion in one of
the sets of e- mails and contended that it " appears to show that individual meetings were
conducted

between

the prospective

developer

and

individual Trustees in September

of

201 8."

I

With regard to the other set of e- mails, you likewise referred this office to a specific section and

contended that it " shows that the Advanced Power/ Oak Meadow Energy attorney ( Lenny Asaro)
dictated

code changes to the

Village

of

Glenwood

Attorney,

John Donahue[.]"

You asserted

that the Board had voted on the code changes at its November 20, 2018, meeting but alleged that

it had made " no mention of the prospective development

Section 3. 5(

a) of

OMA ( 5 ILCS 120/ 3. 5(

a) (

West 2016)) provides,

in pertinent

part:

A person who believes that a violation of this Act by a
public body has occurred may file a request for review with the
Public Access Counselor established in the Office of the Attorney
General not later than 60 days after the alleged violation. If

facts concerning the violation are not discovered within the 60 -day
period, but are discovered at a later date, not exceeding 2 years
after the alleged violation, by a person utilizing reasonable
diligence, the request for review may be made within 60 days of
the' discovery of the alleged violation. The request for review must
be in writing, must be signed by the requester, and must include a
of

summary

the facts supporting the

allegation. (

Emphasis

added.)

Under

language

the plain

of section

3. 5(

a),

a person must submit a Request for Review within 60

days after an alleged violation occurred unless the person did not discover facts concerning the
alleged

violation

within

those

60 days despite utilizing

reasonable

diligence.

Additionally, a

Request for Review of an alleged OMA violation must contain a factual summary sufficient to
indicate that the public body potentially violated OMA.
In this matter, you have alleged that trustees improperly met with Advanced
Power on an individual basis in September of 2018. The e- mails that you provided indicate that

Advanced Power scheduled individual presentations with each of the trustees rather than holding
a presentation at a Board meeting. You also appear to have alleged that the Board did not
provide adequate public notice of the full motivations behind code changes approved at the

Board' s November 20, 2018, meeting. However, you submitted your Request for Review more
than 60 days after the dates of the alleged September 2018 meetings and the Board' s November

20, 2018, meeting, and you have not asserted or provided any facts indicating that you did not
discover the alleged violations before the 60 -day period after those events elapsed despite using
reasonable diligence. Accordingly, it appears that your Request for Review is untimely.
Even if you had demonstrated that you had used reasonable diligence around the

times of those September and November 2018 occurrences and had only discovered the alleged
violations through

conversations between a third party, such as a developer, and a member of a public body
generally would not qualify as " meetings" subject to OMA because they would not involve
deliberations among a majority of a quorum of the members of the public body. Additionally,
with respect to the information that the Board was required to publicly announce before voting
on the code changes during its November 20, 2018, meeting, section 2( e) of OMA ( 5 ILCS
120/ 2( e) ( West 2017 Supp.), as amended by Public Act 100- 646, effective July 27, 2018)
provides: "
Final action shall be preceded by a public recital of the nature of the matter being
considered and other information that will inform the public of the business being conducted."

OMA concerns, the

does not govern other aspects of the process for drafting amendments to an ordinance that occur
outside of meetings or who may participate in that process. Because it appears that you did not
submit your Request for Review before the statutory time period expired, and because the facts
you have alleged do not indicate that the Board violated OMA, this office has determined that no

is issued pursuant to section 3. 5( e) of the Open Meetings Act
West 2016)). For the reasons explainedbelow, the Public Access

Bureau concludes that the Personnel Committee of the Jersey County Board ( Board) held a
meeting on August 20, 2018, at a location that was not convenient and open to the public, and
failed to create a verbatim recording of its closed session meeting held that same day.
BACKGROUND

On October 19, 2018, this office received Mr. Michael Weaver' s Request for

Review alleging that the Committee held a. meeting August 20, 2018, that was not open to the
public and that took place in a different location than the one listed on the agenda. Mr. Weaver

also alleges that the Committee held a closed session during that meeting and did not create a
verbatim recording of the closed session. On November 2, 2018, this office sent a copy of the
Request for Review to the Committee and requested that the Committee or its representative

and the holding of the meeting at a specified time and place that is convenient and open

In his Request for Review, Mr. Weaver asserted that the Committee posted an

agenda for its August 20, 2018, meeting that indicated that the meeting would be held at 6: 00
p. m. in the Jersey County Board Room. Mr. Weaver stated that, prior to the start of the meeting,
the Board chairman directed him to leave the meeting room because the meeting was to be held
in closed session. Mr. Weaver stated that he left the building and waited in his car, and that after
several minutes, the chairman opened the door to the building, motioned to Mr. Weaver, and told
him that the Committee was starting its open session. Mr. Weaver stated that he then went back
into the building and the Board Room, but could not locate the chairman, the other Committee
members, or the meeting. Mr. Weaver stated that he eventually observed the chairman leave the
Board

Mr. Weaver also alleges that, based on representations of others at the meeting,

that no audio recording was made of the proceedings.
In response, the Board and the Committee chairman, Mr. Donald Little, asserted

that the agenda improperly listed the location of the meeting as occurring in the " auditorium,"

of

Board "

office,"

and that he did not notice the error until meeting time when

he found the Committee members, Mr. Weaver, and members of a union bargaining team that

also intended to attend the meeting, in the auditorium instead of the office. Chairman Little
stated that he told Mr. Weaver that the Committee would be holding a closed meeting, and that

Mr. Weaver responded by asserting that a closed meeting nevertheless must start in open session.
Chairman Little said he agreed, and that he would hold the Committee' s open session in the
Board office, but that he needed to discuss a matter with the " bargaining team" before beginning,

and asked Mr. Weaver to leave until the meeting began. Chairman Little stated that when the
Committee members relocated from the auditorium to the office, he went to look for Mr.
Weaver, located him

asserted that the Committee voted in open session to go into closed session, and after that motion
was approved, returned to the Auditorium to hold the closed session. Upon his return to the
Auditorium, Chairman Little stated that he saw Mr. Weaver and informed him that the

Committee had held its open session in the office, was now convening closed session, and
therefore, Mr. Weaver would need to leave. Chairman Little did not directly respond to the
allegation in the Request for Review that the office in which the meeting was held was an

interior office" and that the design of the building made it difficult to see the interior office or
observe a meeting being held there. Finally, Chairman Little acknowledged that the Committee
did not make a verbatim recording of the closed session meeting.

Mr. Weaver replied, disputing in part Chairman Little's recitation of the events

that occurred that evening. Mr. Weaver stated that after Chairman Little motioned for him to
return to the building, he disappeared inside the building before Mr. Weaver could follow him.
Mr. Weaver

asserted

that "[

a"

meeting,"

as defined in section

We note that Mr. Weaver and Chairman Little appear to use

different nomenclature for the room in which the meeting was scheduled to be held. Mr. Weaver
Little
and the agenda describe the location as the " Jersey County Board Room," while Chairman
referred to it as the auditorium. Mr. Weaver asserted that the Jersey County Board Room is a
corner of the auditorium in which small meetings are routinely held. Based on Chairman Little' s
response, it appears that not only Mr. Weaver, but also the Committee members and union
representatives, understood the location of the meeting to be the auditorium.
Chairman Little asserted that the °agenda erroneously listed the location of the

meeting and it should have stated that the meeting was to be held in the Board office. However,
upon realizing the error on the agenda, Chairman Little nevertheless convened the meeting in the
Board office, instead of the location listed on the agenda. Notably, he did so even though he, the
other committee members, and Mr. Weaver ( who had already indicated his interest in attending
the meeting) were present at the place listed on the agenda, at the date and time at which the
meeting was scheduled to begin. Chairman Little did not argue that it was necessary to relocate

the meeting from the location listed on the agenda to the Board office, and did not state that he
posted any signs re -directing interested members of the public to the new location. Moreover, he
did not contest Mr. Weaver's allegation that the Board office is an interior office, that a meeting
being held in that office would not be visible from the entrance to the building, and that the

Board routinely held smaller meetings in the section of the auditorium known as the Board room.
Accordingly, by holding its August 20, 2018, meeting in a location different from that listed on
the agenda and in a location that Mr. Weaver was unable to find, the Committee violated sections

2( a) and 2. 01 of OMA by holding a meeting at a place other than the place specified on the
agenda and at a location that was not convenient

and open to the public.

The meeting minutes from the August 20, 2018, meeting indicate that the meeting
was called to order at 6: 08 p. m., the Committee voted to enter closed session, and then entered
closed session at 6: 09 p. m. Because the Committee did not take final action at the August 20,
2018, meeting, no remedial action is necessary. However, this office reminds the Committee to
ensure that the notice and agenda of all Committee meetings correctly identify the location of the
meeting.

Closed Session Recording

All public bodies are required to " keep written minutes of all their meetings,
whether open or closed, and a verbatim record of all their closed meetings in the form of an
audio

or video

recording."

5 ILCS 120/ 2. 06(

a) (

West 2016)).

Although this requirement is

unambiguous, the Committee admitted that it did not create a verbatim recording of the August
20, 2018, closed session meeting. Accordingly, the Committee. also violated section 2. 06( a) of
OMA. Although there does not appear to be any action that the Committee can take at this time

to remedy its violation of section 2, 06( a) of OMA, this office requests that the Committee take
measures

to ensure that all closed sessions are properly recorded.

The Public Access Counselor has determined that resolution of this matter does
not

require

the issuance

of a

binding

opinion.

If you have any questions, please contact me at

were not adequately identified on the agenda for its December 17, 2018, special meeting. Your

We disagree. February 4, 2019, was 11 days before the initial 60 -day period for

violations

of

Open Meetings Act ( OMA) ( 5 ILCS 120/ 1

Plan Commission ( Commission).

seq. ( West 2016))'

by the Village
Our review of the information you have
et

furnished, however, provides no basis for the Public Access Counselor to conclude that the
Commission

has violated OMA.

On February 25, 2019, this office received your Request for Review alleging that the
Commission

failed to hold

regular

monthly

meetings

and

held only

two

meetings

in 2018.

You

also alleged that the minutes for the Commission' s October 2018 meeting are unavailable. The
other two allegations in your Request for Review relate to. alleged' failures of the Commission to
report

findings

individual

and

collect plats

Commission

and

other

information.

You also provided information about an

member.

Among other things, OMA requires public bodies to conduct public business
openly ( 5 ILCS 120/ 2( a) ( West 2017
27, 2018), provide advance notice of

Supp.), as amended by Public Act 100- 646, effective July
meetings (

and

make

publicly available a schedule of all its regular meetings for its calendar or fiscal year ( 5 ILCS
120/ 2. 03 ( West 2016)).

No provision of OMA, however, requires public bodies to hold a certain

number of meetings per calendar year or provides that a public body violates OMA by falling

short of its goal to meet monthly. Because your Request for Review does not provide a summary
of facts from which this office could conclude that the Commission violated OMA, we have
determined that no further action is warranted as to this allegation. -

Section 2. 06( b)

A public body shall approve the minutes of its open

meeting within 30 days after that meeting or at the public body' s
second subsequent regular meeting, whichever is later. The
minutes of meetings open to the public shall be available for public

inspection within 10 days after the approval of such minutes by the
public

body. (

Emphasis

added.)

Your Request for Review states that the Commission has met only two times in the past year.
Therefore, the information you provided indicates that the Commission has not yet held. a second

subsequent meeting during which it could approve the minutes of any meetings in the past year.
Under

the

language

plain

of section

2. 06( b),

a public body does not need to make its minutes

available until ten days after the minutesare approved. Accordingly, your claim regarding the
approval of the minutes is premature.

205/ 7(

3) ( West 2016)),

to alleged violations

of

the Public Access Counselor' s authority to resolve disputes is limited

Therefore, your allegations regarding the failure of the Commission to report findings

RE:

OMA Request for Review — 2019 PAC 56468

Dear Ms. Sinkevicius:

This determination letter is issued pursuant to section 3. 5( b). of the Open Meetings
Act ( OMA) ( 5 ILCS 120/ 3. 5( b) ( West 2016)).

For the reasons set forth below, the Public Access

Bureau concludes that no further action is warranted in this matter,

On January 16, 2019, you submitted a Request for Review to the Public Access

Bureau raising OMA allegations against James Wadsworth Elementary School' s Local School
Council ( LSC) and its Professional Personnel Leadership Committee ( Committee).
Section 3. 5(

allegation." (

As to the LSC, you alleged:

The LSC has not posted any meeting minute notes and are
handling public matters in closed sessions such as budget transfers.

The LSC requires all in attendance to sign in as a guest even if they
are only observing. Meetings generally are only 13 minutes long
with no information as to how decisions are made regarding the

agendas for closed session meetings are not posted.'?

Your allegations concerning the LSC are general in nature and devoid of pertinent
facts, such as the dates of the meetings at issue. Your allegation that the LSC has discussed
improper matters, such as budget transfers, in closed session is insufficient to warrant further

action by this office absent facts about when and how this conduct allegedly occurred and the
specific nature of the discussions. Your claim that the LSC requires meeting attendees to sign in

as guests does not allege that the LSC improperly restricted public access to an open meeting
because it does not indicate that anyone objected to signing in or was prohibited from attending a
meeting because of being unwilling to sign in. Your claim that LSC meetings are typically brief.
and lacking in information does not allege a violation of section 2( e) of OMA ( 5 ILCS 120/ 2( e)
West 2017 Supp.), as amended by Public Act 100- 646, effective July 27, 2018) absent a
summary of facts detailing the proceedings at a specific meeting. 2 , Your claim that the LSC has
not posted meeting minutes does not warrant further action by this office because section 2. 06( b)
of OMA ( 5 ILCS 120/ 2. 06( b) ( West 2916))
requires only the " governing body" of a public body

to post its meeting minutes online. That role of "governing body" is filled by the Board of
Education

your allegation

At any open meeting of

a public body for which proper notice under this Act has been given, the body may, without

Turning to the Committee, you alleged that the two chairpersons " have not
to attend" meetings, "
have been removing public notices off the

allowed members of the public

walls of the school building about the meetings or not posting notices, and are refusing to post

meeting minute notes." 3 . You did not, however, identify the dates of any such instances or the

This office' s review of the Board' s July 11, 2018, regular meeting agenda and
online calendar record confirmed that the Board approved its May 9, 2018, meeting minutes on
that date. The Board acknowledged that it posted a copy of the May 9, 2018, minutes on its
website on July 27, 2018, which is more than 10 days after it approved those minutes. Although
the Board asserted that the Secretary works with its IT department and Granicus to prepare and
post meeting materials, the Board has not claimed that its website is not maintained by the Park
District' s full- time staff or that it is not subject to the posting requirements of section 2. 06( b).
Accordingly, based on the available information, this office concludes that the Board did not post
its May 9, 2018, meeting minutes within 10 days of approval as required by section 2. 06( b) of
OMA.
Because the Board has since posted a copy of its May 9, 2018, meeting minutes on its
website,

no remedial

action

is necessary.

This office reminds the Board, however,

that it must

post the minutes of its regular meetings within 10 days after approving them.

that resolution

This determination

is issued pursuant to section 3. 5( b) of the Open Meetings Act

For the reasons set forth below, the Public Access

Bureau concludes that no further action in this matter is warranted.
In your Request for Review, received March 19, 2019, you claimed that at its

March 18, 2019, meeting, the City of Waukegan City Council (Council) applied its public
comment rule prohibiting electioneering inconsistently by interrupting your comments, but
permitting three other individuals to speak on election -related topics without interruption.

provides that "[

a] ny

person shall be permitted an opportunity to address public officials under the rules established

by the public body." . A public body violates section 2. 06( g) of OMA when it: ( 1)

prohibits a member of the public from addressing its members in a manner inconsistent with its
established and recorded rules, or ( 2) prohibits a member of the public from providing public

comment pursuant to its established and recorded rules but those rules unreasonably restrict that

meeting but was improperly restricted by the public body from doing so. See, e. g., I11. Att' y Gen.
PAC Req. Rev. Ltr. 42017, issued June 1, 2016, at 1- 2 ( determining that a Request for Review
alleging that a board' s public comment rules violated section 2. 06( g) of OMA did not warrant
further inquiry because the Request for Review did not allege that anyone who attempted to
address the board during an open meeting was improperly denied an opportunity to speak).
Your Request for Review alleged that the Council permitted certain individuals to
speak on election - related topics, but prohibited your comments on the same or similar topics.

However, this office has viewed portions of the recording of the March 18, 2019, Council
meeting,' and did not discern that you were interrupted during your comments regarding
aldermanic

candidates.

Although

the Mayor struck his gavel once after you began your

comments regarding his mother's lawsuits, you were permitted to continue your comments on
that topic without further interruption until your three minutes of allotted speaking time expired.
This office has previously determined that a brief interruption that does not preclude a speaker
from completing his or her public comment does not constitute an improper restriction on public
comment.
See Ill. Att' y Gen. PAC Req. Rev. Ltr. 37496, issued December 11, 2015. You did
not allege that anyone else was denied the opportunity to address the Council during the March.
18, 2019, meeting. Accordingly, because your March 19, 2019, Request for Review did not

allege facts supporting the allegation that the Council violated section 2. 06( g) of OMA during its
March 18, 2019, meeting, this office will take no further action in this matter.2
Accordingly,

this file is closed.

Request for

Review —2018 PAC 53264

Dear

The Public Access Counselor has received your Request for Review concerning

an Open Meetings Act ( OMA) violation by the Grand Prairie Community Consolidated School
District No. 6 Board of Education ( Board) in connection with its May 15, 2018, meeting. In a
March 21., 2019, telephone conversation with a Supervising Attorney in the Public Access
Bureau, you confirmed that this matter may now be closed due to the passage of time but that
you reserve the right to submit future Requests for Review should the Board violate the
requirements

of OMA.

Accordingly, this letter serves to close this matter. If you have questions, please
contact me at ( 217) 785- 7438 or at the Springfield address below.

This determination is issued pursuant to section 3. 5( b) of the Open Meetings Act

in this matter.

Your Request for Review alleges that the December 3, 2018, meeting minutes of
the Peoria

which the Board approved on January 10, 2019, violated

OMA because the minutes listed the addresses of those persons who made public comment at the

You have not alleged that the Board failed to include any of the specifically
required

information in

the minutes

of

its December 3, 2018, meeting.

Rather you allege that

including addresses of individuals who participated in public comment in the minutes could
discourage members of the public from exercising their statutory right to address the Board
pursuant to section

2. 06( g)

of

OMA ( 5 ILCS 120/ 2. 06( g) ( West 2016)).

However, neither

section 2. 06( a) nor section 2. 06( g) prohibits public bodies from including speakers' addresses in
meeting minutes. Because the facts you have alleged do not indicate that the Board violated the
requirements of OMA, this office has determined that no further action is warranted in this

matter. Accordingly, this file is closed.'

Unless the public body has made a determination that the

treatment

or otherwise

consents to disclosure,

the -

The

that the Township failed to comply with the requirements of section 9( a) of FOIA ( 5 ILCS
140/ 9( a) ( West 2016)).

First, although you also asked the Township to clarify whether it believed the
entirety of the closed session discussion was proper, a public body is not required to answer
questions in response to a FOIA request. Kenyon v. Garrets, 184 111. App. 3d 28, 32 ( 4th Dist.
1989.

Because section 2. 06( a) prohibits the disclosure

of closed session

recordings,

absent a determination of the public body to the contrary, this office construes the Township' s
response

to your

140/ 7( 1)(

request as a

denial

pursuant

to section

7( 1)(

Supp.), as amended by Public Act 100- 732. effective August 3, 2018).
i] nformation specifically prohibited from disclosure by federal
or State law or rules and regulations implementing federal or State law."
The Township asserted
that the Board had not made a determination that the verbatim recording of the closed session of
its February 15, 2019, meeting no longer requires confidential treatment. This office has not
received information to the contrary. Therefore, no further action is warranted as to your claim
which

exempt

from disclosure "[

that the Township improperly denied your FOIA request. 5

With regard to the Township' s compliance with the procedural requirements for denying a
reqeust, section 9( a) of FOIA provides:

Each public body denying a request for public records shall notify the
requester in writing of the decision to deny the request, the reasons for the

denial, including a detailed factual basis for the application of any exemption
claimed, and the names and titles or positions of each person responsible for the

denial. Each notice of denial by a public body shall also inform such person of
the right to review by the Public Access Counselor and provide the address. and
phone number for the Public Access Counselor. Each notice of denial shall
inform such person of his right to judicial review under Section II of this Act.

In the Township' s e- mailed response to your request, the Township cited the specific OMA
provision that was the basis for its denial, including the language of that provision. The Township also provided the

name and title of the Township employee who appears to have been responsible for denying your request. The
Township did not cite section 7( I)( a) of FOIA, nor did it set forth the requisite information concerning your right to
request a review by the Public Access Counselor or seek judicial review. This office reminds the Township that a

public body is required to include all of the information listed in section 9( a) of FOIA whenever it denies any
portion of a

FOIA

request.

On December 10, 2018, the Public Access Bureau sent a copy of the Request for

Under the plain language of section 2. 06( g) of OMA, public comment

Although OMA does not specifically address the types of public comment rules

ensure that meetings are conducted efficiently. See I.A. Rana Enterprises, Inc. v. City ofAurora,

6. 2

The Council shall provide a period for Citizen Comment.

Interested persons shall sign their name, address and the agenda

participation sheet. A speaker may address the Council for no
more than three minutes, and only once per Council meeting. The
maximum time period for citizen participation is forty- five
minutes.

If there are more than 15 speakers, the Mayor will

allocate time among the speakers to ensure that citizen comment

does not exceed forty- five (45) minutes. The business of the City
Council shall commence no later than forty- five (45) minutes after
the beginning of Citizen Comment. 131

In this instance, 19 members of

the public signed - up on the citizen participation sheet that was circulated at the beginning of the

December 3, 2018, meeting. The chair of the Committee reviewed the sheet and determined
that, because more than 15 speakers had signed -up to speak, the amount of public comment time
to be allotted would be one minute per speaker. A total of 16 speakers chose to address the

Committee, and the public comment portion of the meeting lasted Tess than 23 minutes. The
Committee chair informed several speakers that their one minute of public comment time had
expired and requested that those speakers cease their speech.

Request for Review asserted that the chair chose to limit public
comment. time to one minute per speaker because she was aware of the probable content of the

speakers' speech in light of a recent recommendation from the Board of Ethics. The Committee
countered that the chair exercised her discretion under the Council' s rules to limit comment to •

one minute per speaker because a Human Services Committee meeting was scheduled

immediately following the Committee meeting. The Committee stated that the Human Services
Committee meeting was delayed by nearly an hour and a half from its scheduled start time.

The Committee has not provided an explanation for why the chair' s application of
its rules to limit public comment to one minute per speaker was necessary to promote order and
decorum at the meeting or to further any significant governmental interest. The rule appears to
be intended to provide an opportunity for all members of the public who wish to address the
Committee to do so within a public comment period that is not to exceed 45 minutes. The
manner in which the Committee applied its rule limited the public comment period to less than

23 minutes. Although public bodies have an interest in conserving time and ensuring that all
interested parties have an opportunity to speak, the Committee may not unreasonably restrict
public comment to accommodate its meeting schedule, particularly where a need for additional
time between meetings may have been foreseeable. As an example, suppose 14 members of the

public had signed -up on the citizen participation sheet at the Committee meeting instead of 19.
Under this scenario, each member would have been entitled to speak for up to three minutes,
which means that the public comment period for the meeting may have exceeded 40 minutes. It
is unreasonable that, through the use of its rules, the Committee afforded less total time for
public comment because more members of the public wished to speak.

Further, it is unclear why it was necessary for the chair to deviate from the 45 -

minute maximum of public comment time set forth in its rules and limit. public comment time to
only one minute of comment per speaker when a less restrictive option was available. Because

19 members of the public signed up to speak, the chair could have elected to provide each
speaker with 2 minutes of public comment time, which would not have exceeded the 45 -minute
maximum

limitation than was necessary to adhere to its rules indicates that the Committee' s application of
the rules was intended to restrict comment from members of the public. Because the

Committee' s use of its rules served to unreasonably restrict rather than to accommodate the
public' s right to address the members of the Committee, this office concludes that Committee

violated section 2. 06( g) of O
. MA by enforcing its public comment rules to limit public comment
to one minute per speaker at its December 3, 2018, meeting.
second allegation is that the Committee allowed the attorney for an
alderman to comment for an extended time outside of the public comment period.

This

allegation, however, is outside the scope of OMA. As discussed above, section 2. 06( g) of OMA
is intended to ensure that members of the public have the opportunity to address public officials
at public meetings. The Committee' s decision to hear comment by the attorney outside of public
implicate OMA.

Because the Public Access Bureau' s authority is

RE:

OMA Request for Review — 2019 PAC 56977

and Ms. Harper:

This determination is issued pursuant to section 3. 5( e) of the Open Meetings Act
OMA) ( 5 ILCS 120/ 3. 5(

e) (

West 2016)).

For the reasons that follow, the Public Access Bureau

concludes that the Elmhurst Public Library ( Library) Board of Trustees ( Board) violated the

requirements of OMA by failing to conduct a semi- annual review of all of its closed meeting
minutes

in

accordance with

section

2. 06( d)

of

OMA ( 5 ILCS 120/ 2. 06( d) ( West 2016)).

On February 23, 2019,
submitted this Request for Review alleging
that the Board violated section 2. 06( d) of OMA by failing to conduct a semi- annual review of its
closed session meeting minutes since June 19, 2018. On February 28, 2019, this office sent a

copy of the Request for Review to the Board and asked it to address

allegations. On

March 4, 2019, Library Director Mary Beth Harper responded on the Board' s behalf,
acknowledging that the Board had not conducted such a review of its closed session minutes
within the past six months. However, Ms. Harper asserted that the Board would comply with the

requirements of section 2. 06( d) at its next regular meeting on March 19, 2019, and implement
mechanisms to ensure future compliance.

Attorney General in the Public Access Bureau,

reiterated his contentions.

DETERMINATION

The Open Meetings Act provides that public agencies exist to aid in the conduct

of the people' s business, and that the intent of the Act is to assure that agency actions be taken
openly and that their deliberations be conducted openly." Gosnell v. Hogan, 179 I11. App. 3d
161, 171 ( 5th Dist. 1989).

Section 2. 06( d) of OMA provides, in pertinent part:

Each public body shall periodically, but no less than semi-

annually, meet to review minutes of all closed meetings. At such
meetings a determination

shall be made, and reported in an open

session that ( 1) the need for confidentiality still exists as to all or
part of those minutes or.( 2) that the minutes or portions thereof no

longer require confidential treatment and are available for public
inspection. ( Emphasis added.)

The Board acknowledged that it failed to conduct a semi- annual review of its

dosed session minutes. Accordingly, this office concludes that the Board violated the
requirements of section 2. 06( d) of OMA.

In light of the Board' s plans to review closed session

minutes both at its March 19, 2019, meeting and on a semi- annual basis going forward, no
further remedial action is required.

The Public Access Counselor has determined that resolution of this matter does

not require the issuance of a binding opinion. This letter serves to close this matter. If you have

OMA Request for Review — 2018 PAC 54031

e) (

West 2016)).

For the reasons explained

below, the Public Access

Bureau concludes that the Community Consolidated School District No. 59 ( District) Board of
Education ( Board) did not improperly discuss matters that were outside the scope of the
exception on which it relied to close a portion of its July 9, 2018, meeting.
In his Request for Review, Dr. Tim Burns, a member of the Board, alleged that

during its July 9, 2018, meeting, the Board violated OMA by discussing matters in closed session
were not encompassed
by the section 2( c)( 1) exception, ( 5 ILCS 120/ 2( c)( 1) ( West 2017

The Board' s response to this office2 asserted that the meeting was properly closed
pursuant to

2(

c)(

1),

stating:

Dr. Bums' s] claim is not supported by the closed session
audio recording and is therefore erroneous. The audio recording
clearly reveals that Assistant Superintendent Ludeloff presented

information to the Board regarding allegations contained in a letter

attorney to access the employee' s personnel file and related
information. l31

Based on this office' s review of the verbatim recording of the closed session
portion of the Board' s July 9, 2018, meeting, the Assistant Superintendent' s presentation
pertained to circumstances involving the employment of an individual employee. Although the

presentation referenced a letter from the specific employee' s attorney alleging certain statutory
violations by the Board in relation to the employee' s reassignment, these allegations and the .
other matters discussed in closed session directly related to the employment of a particular
employee,

In fact, the Board' s response to this office

stated " the letter from the employee' s attorney referred to by Associate Superintendent Luedloff

initiation. i4 Therefore, it appears that at the time of the Board' s July 9, 2018, meeting, the Board
would not have had a reasonable basis to believe that litigation by the employee was more likely

OMA does not require a public body to cite the exception that permits the most expansive

discussion of a topic provided that the public body confines its discussion to the exception under
which it entered closed session.

Because the closed session directly concerned the employment of a specific
employee, this office concludes that the Board' s discussion was within the scope. of the section

2( c)( 1) exception under which it closed the meeting, and therefore, the Board' s closed session
discussion did not violate OMA.

Request for Review
alleging that on January 16, 2019, Board member John Butitta sent an e- mail to all other
members of the Board attaching a letter in which Mr. Butitta urged the other members to call for
the withdrawal of a certain proposal or to reject the proposal at an upcoming Board meeting. On

February 19, 2019, this office sent a copy of the Request for Review to the Board and requested
that it provide a written response to
allegations and requested copies of any records
that documented those discussions, as well as copies of any records of communications, such as
e- mails and text messages. On February 28, 2019, the Board provided the records of

DETERMINATION
The Open Meetings Act provides that public agencies exist to aid in the conduct

of the people' s business, and that the intent of the Act is to assure that agency actions be taken
openly
161,

and that their deliberations

171 ( 5th Dist. 1989).

be

conducted

openly."

Gosnell v. Hogan, 179 Ill. App. 3d

In order for the requirements of OMA to apply, a gathering must

constitute a " meeting" as defined by section 1. 02 of OMA ( 5 ILCS 120/ 1. 02 ( West 2016)):

Meeting" means any gathering, whether in person or by
video or audio conference, telephone call, electronic means ( such
as, without limitation,

electronic

mail, electronic

chat, and instant

messaging), or other means of contemporaneous interactive

communication, of a majority of a quorum of the members of a

public body held for the purpose of discussing public business or,
for a 5 -member public body, a quorum of the members of a public
body held for the purpose of discussing public business.
Under this statutory definition, a " meeting" may include communications through
e- mail or other electronic means. The Board is comprised of twenty members.

Accordingly,

eleven Board members constitute a quorum, and a majority of the quorum is six members.
Therefore, contemporaneous, interactive e- mail or other electronic communications involving at
least six members of the Board which concern " public business" would ordinarily constitute a
meeting of the Board which would be subject to the procedural safeguards and requirements of
OMA.

OMA does

not

define " interactive"

or "

contemporaneous."

In interpreting statutes

such as OMA, undefined statutory terms must be afforded their " plain, ordinary, and popular
meanings[,]"

which

may be

gleaned

from dictionaries.

See,

e.

g.,

Valley Forge Insurance Co. v.

Swiderski Electronics, 223 I11. 2d 352, 366 ( 2006).

Interactive" is defined, in relevant part, as " mutually or reciprocally active."'
This office has reviewed the e- mails the Board provided concerning Mr. Butitta's January 16,
2019, e- mail and letter. The letter 'contained Mr. Butitta' s opinion regarding a proposed change

to County ordinance provisions concerning the authority of the County administrator. The
relevant communications are as follows: On January 10, 2019, Mr. Butitta sent a draft of the

January 16, 2019, letter to another Board member. The Board member responded approximately
ten hours later and did not include any other Board members on the e- mail. On January 16,
2019, Mr. Butitta attempted to send the message and letter at issue to the 19 other Board
members and himself. It appears as though Mr. Butitta misspelled five of the Board members' e-

mail addresses, but presumably the e- mail was successfully transmitted to 15 Board members.
Nine minutes later, Mr. Butitta sent the same message and attachment to the same 19 Board
members' e- mail addresses and himself, and copied two additional e- mail addresses for a Board
member whose e- mail he had misspelled.
Shortly thereafter, Mr. Butitta sent four separate emails attaching the letter, one to each of four of the five Board members whose e- mail addresses
he had

misspelled.

On January 16, 2019, at 1: 04 p. m., a Board member replied to Mr. Butitta' s

e- mail, but did not copy any other individuals. On January 16, 2019, at 3: 25 p. m., a different
Board member replied to Mr. Butitta' s e- mail, but did not copy any other individuals. On

January 18, 2019, a third Board member replied to Mr. Butitta's e- mail, but did not copy any
other individuals. On January 16, 2019, one Board member forwarded Mr. Butitta' s e- mail to an
individual who is not on the Board. On January 18, 2019, two other Board members forwarded
Mr. Butitta' s message to other individuals who are not on the Board. Importantly, none of the e-

mail strings provided to this office regarding the January 16, 2019, correspondence included six
or more Board members engaged in interactive communications by responding to each other's emails.

The Board also included two e- mail strings related to Mr. Butitta' s letter that

originated from individuals who are not members of the Board. The first e- mail string begins

with a message sent on January 19, 2019, from anon -Board member to a single Board member,
who then forwards the message to three other Board members. One Board member then
forwards the message to a non -Board member. There is no indication from the records provided

that any Board members replied to each other. The second e- mail is from a non -Board member
to seven Board members. Again, there is no indication that any Board members responded to the
individual' s e- mail.

In sum, none of the relevant communications

that the Board provided to this

office were " interactive" communications of at least a majority of a quorum of the Board. This
office has not received evidence from which we could determine that such communications

occurred. Accordingly, based on the available information, this office concludes that Mr.
Butitta' s January 16, 2019, e- mail did not elicit communications among Board members which
constituted a " meeting"

subject

to the

requirements

of

OMA.

A person who believes that a violation of this Act by a

concerning the violation are not discovered within the 60 -day

The

changes made by this amendatory Act of the 99th General
Assembly apply to violations alleged to have occurred at meetings

This provision permits a person using reasonable diligence who discovers an alleged violation of

OMA after the initial 60 -day period has expired to submit a Request for Review, including a
summary of facts supporting the allegation, within 60 days of the date that the violation was
discovered.

Your allegation concerning the Board' s February 26, 2018, and April 23, 2018,

closed session meetings is vague and does not provide a summary of facts indicating the Board
discussed

matters outside of the exceptions

cited.

Further, to the extent your Request for Review

refers to the counsel for the Board' s statement in his May' 9, 2018, letter that " the Board

discussed ongoing proceedings with

For the reasons set forth below, the Public Access

On March 20, 2019, this office received your Request for Review alleging that the

closed meeting, in violation of the Open Meeting Act in regards to
closed meetings?'

The information you provided regarding the comments made during the March 19, 2019,
meeting is that Township Supervisor Joe Musso allegedly said: " I will tell you as long as that
person is still capable of gettin' after us I would like to leave them closed. 1 don' t want a

the closed session discussion concerned evicting the multi -township assessor from the Township
Hall. Given that you also stated that a member of the public protested the Board' s adjournment

to closed session and was arrested and removed from the meeting when he continued to argue

that the Board did not have a legitimate basis for entering closed session, it appears that you
would have been aware of facts concerning the alleged violation at that time. Your timeline also
appears to indicate that on October 16, 2018, the Township Supervisor acknowledged that no
lawsuit had been filed in

For the reasons that follow, the Public Access

The Illinois Appellate Court addressed the scope of section 2( c)( 5) of OMA in

Galena Gazette Publications Inc., v. County ofJo Daviess, 375 111. App. 3d 338 ( 2d Dist. 2007),

in which the public body held a closed session meeting held to discuss the possibility of leasing a
specific property for its use. There, the plaintiff conceded that the public body could permissibly
discuss the material terms of the lease in closed session, but argued that the scope of section

2( c)( 5) did not extend to " peripheral matters" that were raised, such as how the public body
would utilize the leased space. Galena Gazette, 375 I11. App. 3d at 344. The court disagreed,

finding that nothing in the language of section 2( c)( 5) distinguishes " material" matters from
peripheral ones. Galena Gazette, 375 111. App. 3d at 344. The court added that it would be

impractical for the public body to have a meaningful discussion of the lease terms if it was
precluded from discussing related details needed to put the terms in context. Galena Gazette,

2( c)( 6) of OMA does " not extend to the discussion of general issues concerning the disposal of
publicly -owned property.").

In his reply,
noted that the minutes from the Board' s January 24, 2018,
closed session, which the Board recently made available to the public, fail to identify any

particular property that was discussed at the meeting, and fail to show that a proposed lease or
contract for.purchase was presented to the Board.

further states that the Library is

restricted from selling the West Branch without prior notice according to the terms of an

intergovernmental agreement between the Library and the District. Therefore, he asserts, the
Board cannot discuss the setting of a price for the sale or lease of the West Branch prior to

deciding to terminate the intergovernmental agreement with the District, and closed session
deliberation about the termination of that agreement would be outside the scope of the cited
exemptions.

Based on this office' s confidential

review of the closed session recordings of each

of the four meetings, the Board held lengthy discussions concerning the potential purchase or
lease of real property for the use of the public body, including discussions as to whether specific
parcels should be acquired or leased.
of

OMA.

These discussions were permissible under section 2( c)( 5)

argues that the information provided in the minutes of the Board' s January

24, 2018, closed session and in response to a FOIA request he submitted indicated that the Board

was not considering a specific lease or sale agreement during that meeting. However, nothing in
the language of section 2( c)( 5) limits a public body from discussing a potential purchase or lease

of property if the public body has not presented its members with proposed terms for an
agreement.

Our review of the four closed session recordings indicates that a significant portion

of each meeting was devoted to discussing specific parcels of property for use by the Library,
including the pros and cons of different parcels, the Library' s anticipated uses of those parcels,
and the financial terms of the transactions under consideration.

Additionally, our confidential review of the recordings from the March, July, and
August closed sessions indicates that the Board also discussed at those meetings the setting of a
price for sale or lease of the building owned by the Library which currently houses the West
Branch.

These discussions

Although

argues

that the intergovernmental agreement between the Library and District restricts the Library' s

public body owns.
However, our review indicated that, for short portions of each of the four

meetings at issue, the Board held discrete discussions concerning the property currently housing
the West Branch that were not limited to the setting of a price for that property, along with some
other matters related to the West Branch. We have thoroughly reviewed the arguments presented
by the Board in the confidential portions of its written response to the Request for Review, and

Accordingly, this office concludes that the Board violated OMA by discussing

certain unauthorized topics in closed session during its January 24, 2018, March 28, 2018, July
25, 2018, and August 29, 2018, meetings. To remedy these violations, this office asks that the
Board vote to release to the public the limited portions of these closed session recordings as

listed above. The remainder of the recordings may remain confidential unless the Board
determines that the need for confidentiality no longer exists.

not require the issuance of a binding opinion. Please contact me at ( 312). 814- 6437 or the

BACKGROUND

On February 11, 2019,
submitted a Request for Review to the
Public Access Bureau alleging that the Board potentially violated OMA during its January 14,
2019, meeting by voting to place a referendum question on the ballot for the upcoming April 2,
2019, election without having listed that topic on the meeting' s agenda. Specifically, he asserted:
The minutes state that the trustee asked the Attorney about the
possibility of placing a non bi[ n] ding referendum question on the
ballot and the next line of the minutes had a trustee making a
motion on a lengthy question that absolutely had to be predetermined.

voiced3 an objection during the meeting to the lack of advance notice for the referendum question

BE IT FUIRITHER RESOLVED, that the Secretary of
the Board of Trustees, acting as the local election authority take all
actions necessary to certify the foregoing public question to be
placed upon the ballot for the April 2, 2019 Consolidated

Election.

This Resolution shall be in full force and effect upon its

passage and approval as required by law. 1101
The resolution, which was signed and dated January 14, 2019, contains specific
recitals and affirmative language signaling the formality of the Board' s action. Although the
resolution did not resolve the consolidation issue, the vote on the resolution was a distinct final

action that disposed of the matter of officially placing a referendum question before voters of the
District. The non- binding nature of the public question does not exclude the Board' s vote from
the requirements of section 2. 02( c) of OMA. Article 28 of the Election Code ( 10 ILCS 5/ 28- 1 et
seq. ( West 2016)) provides specific
legal effect and advisory questions

As the Board noted, those

procedures provide for the governing body of a unit of local government to pass a resolution to
place a public question on a

ballot.

See 10 ILCS 5/ 28- 7 ( West 2016).

This formal requirement

for submitting a public question to referendum distinguishes the Board' s vote from an optional,

intermediate step in furtherance of final action that is not necessitated by a statutory provision
mandating the approval of a resolution.

The plain language of section 2. 02( c) requires a public body to include the general
subject matter of such a resolution on the meeting agenda before taking final action.
This office' s review confirmed that no items set forth the general subject matter of submitting the
public

The agenda did not reflect a connection

between

items 9C and

8A in a manner that could have conveyed to members of the public that a public question about

consolidation would be subject to a vote during the meeting. Therefore, this office concludes
that the Board did not provide proper advance notice under section 2. 02( c) of OMA of its vote to

adopt the resolution during its January 14, 2019, meeting. At this time, no corrective action can
be taken to remedy this violation.
However, this office advises the incoming Board that the
agendas for its future meetings must identify the general subject matters of all items upon which
the Board wishes to take final action.

Dear

This determination is issued pursuant to section 3. 5( b) of the Open Meetings Act
OMA) ( 5 ILCS 120/ 3. 5( b) ( West 2016)).

For the reasons set forth below, the Public Access

Bureau concludes that no further action in this matter is warranted.

In your Request for Review, received by this office on March 26, 2019, you
alleged that the West Park Career Academy' s Local School Council ( Council) does not provide
accurate and complete English translation of public comments that are made in Spanish during
Council

You requested that the Council provide transparent translation of speakers'

Neither FOIA nor OMA contain provisions governing a public body' s translation

It provides that

120/ 3. 5( b) ( West 2016)).

that no further action is warranted

For the reasons explained

below, this office has

on this matter.

On April 1, 2019, you submitted this Request for Review alleging that the City of
Waukegan' s ( City' s) City Council ( City Council) and the City' s Mayor violated OMA.
Specifically, your Request for Review states that an event was held at City Hall on January 28,
2019, to honor the City' s outstanding students. You allege that improper electioneering occurred
at this event when the mayor permitted a named person to post a campaign sign near the mayor' s

office advertising the named person' s candidacy for a position on the City' s Board of Education.
Section

3. 5(

a)

of

OMA ( 5 ILCS 120/ 3. 5(

a) (

West 2016))

provides

that a " request

for review must be in writing, must be signed by the requester, and must include a summary of
the

facts supporting the

allegation." (

Emphasis added.)

OMA is intended to " ensure that the actions of public bodies be taken openly and
that their

deliberations be

conducted

openly."

5 ILCS 120/ 1 ( West 2016).

No portion of OMA,

however, governs the regulation of campaign signs. Therefore, your allegation that the City
Council, or the Mayor, may have impermissibly permitted the posting of a campaign sign on
public property does not provide a summary of facts supporting the allegation that the City

Please note, the Public Access Counselor' s authority is limited to resolving
disputes concerning the Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA) .( 5 ILCS 140/ 1 et seq. ( West 2016))
and OMA.
15 ILCS 205/ 7( c) ( West 2016). To the extent that your Request for Review could be

construed as alleging violations of State laws other than FOIA or OMA, the Public Access
Counselor does not have authority to review those alleged violations.

Accordingly, this office has determined that no further action is warranted on this
matter. If you have any questions, you may contact me by mail at the Chicago address at the
bottom of the first page of this letter. This letter serves to close this matter.

Very truly yours,

SHANNON BARNABY

Public Access Bureau

Further, even if this office had the authority to review your allegations, your Request for Review
was untimely. Section 3. 5( a) of OMA ( 5 ILCS 120/ 3. 5( a) ( West 2016)) provides, in pertinent part:
A person who believes that a violation of this Act by a public body has
occurred may file a request for review with the Public Access Counselor

established in the Office of the Attorney General not later than 60 days after the
alleged violation. If facts concerning the violation are not discovered within the

60 -day period, but are discovered at a later date, not exceeding 2 years after the
alleged violation, by a person utilizing reasonable diligence, the request for

review may be made within 60 days of the discovery of the alleged violation.
You submitted your Request for Review more than 60 days after the date of the alleged violation, and you have not

asserted or provided any facts indicating that you did not discover the alleged violation before the 60 -day period
expired despite using reasonable diligence.

Because you did not submit your Request for Review before the

statutory period for doing so expired, this office lacks authority to review your allegations concerning the January
28, 2019, meeting.

This determination letter is issued pursuant to section 3. 5( b) of the Open Meetings
Act ( OMA) ( 5 ILCS 120/ 3. 5( b) ( West 2016))'.

For the reasons set forth below, the Public

Access Bureau concludes that no further action is warranted as to this matter.

On March 5, 2019, you submitted this Request for Review alleging that the
Waukegan City Council ( City Council) violated OMA in connection with its March 4, 2019,
meeting. Specifically, you alleged that the Mayor sought to limit your right to public comment
by various means, including interrupting you during your three- minute time limit.
Section 2. 06( g)

of

OMA ( 5 ILCS 120/ 2. 06( g) ( West 2016))

provides that "[

a] ny

person shall be permitted an opportunity to address public officials under the rules established
and recorded by the public body." The Public Access Bureau has previously determined that, in

order to warrant further action by this office, a Request for Review concerning public comment
must set forth facts indicating that a member of the public attempted to address public officials
during an open meeting but was improperly restricted from appropriately doing so. See, e. g., I11.
Att' y Gen. PAC Req. Rev. Ltr. 42017, issued June 1, 2016, at 1- 2 ( determining that a Request for
Review alleging that a board' s public comment rules violated section 2. 06( g) of OMA did not
warrant further inquiry because the Request for Review did not allege that anyone who attempted
to address the board was improperly denied an opportunity to speak).
Your Request for Review outlined numerous concerns with the City Council and
Mayor with respect to public comment; however, you have not alleged that you or any other
individual attempted to speak at the meeting but was denied an opportunity to address the City

All three present trustees, Shaw, Spacone, and Sprawka, read actively a lot of

material in the weeks before each meeting. And, in fact, the meeting is there for

that occurs happens in the weeks before the

takes place in a collaborative, polite way even if we are debating one another.

bodies conduct business openly.
BACKGROUND

2018 PAC 55642

On November 7, 2018, this office received a Request for Review ( 2018 PAC

55642) from Mr. William Thompson, on behalf of the Western Illinois University Chapter of the
University Professionals of Illinois, alleging improper closed session discussions by the Board

during its July 12, 2018, meeting. Specifically, Mr. Thompson stated that he had recently
listened to the recording of portions of the closed session meeting held by the Board on June 28,
2018, and reported that the University' s Senior Vice President discussed with the Board's Chair
the possibility of discussing program reductions in the closed session of the Board's next
meeting. Mr. Thompson alleged that if a discussion of program reductions being made for either
budgetary or curriculum reasons had occurred, that discussion would not be authorized under the
closed sessions exceptions described in section 2( c) of the Open Meetings Act ( 5 ILCS 120/ 2( c)

West 2017 Supp.)).

Mr. Thompson stated that his Request for Review was timely filed, despite being
submitted more than 60 days after the date of the alleged violation, because he only discovered
the violation after the release• of the closed session recording, which the Board had previously
maintained as confidential)

This office concludes that because these alleged violations occurred

in closed session, they could not have been discovered within 60 days by a person using
reasonable diligence. Mr. Thompson discovered the alleged violations within two years of the

meeting, and filed this Request for Review within 60 days of that discovery. Therefore, this
Request for Review

was

filed

within

the statutory

time

limitation. See 5 ILCS 120/ 3. 5(

a) (

West

2016).

On November 19, 2018, this office forwarded a copy of the Request for Review to
the Board and asked it to provide this office with copies of the closed session minutes and closed
session verbatim recording of the July 12, 2018, meeting for this office's review, together with a
written response to Mr. Thompson' s allegations.

The Board made the recording of portions of its June 28, 2018, closed session meeting available
to Mr. Thompson on November 5, 2018, in compliance with the Attorney General' s Binding Opinion 18- 012, which
determined that portions of the Board' s discussion at that meeting were not permitted by the closed session
exceptions

to the Open

Meetings

Act.

2018 PAC 55739

On November 15, 2018, this office received a Request for Review ( 2018 PAC

55739) from Mr. Rich Egger, on behalf of Tri -States Public Radio, alleging that the Board may
have improperly discussed matters during closed sessions of meetings held in 2017 and 2018.
Mr. Egger also referenced the statements made during the June 28, 2018, closed session
2
concerning the possibility of discussing program reductions at the next meeting.
On November 27, 2018, this office forwarded a copy of the Request for Review to
the Board and asked it to provide this office with copies of the agenda,

open and closed session

minutes, and closed session verbatim recording from the July 12, 2018, meeting for this office' s
review, together with a written response to Mr. Egger' s allegations.
On December

7, 2018, with the permission

of this office, the Board addressed

both Requests for Review by furnishing a single written response asserting that all discussions
held during the July 12, 2018, closed session were authorized by either section 2( c)( 1) or 2( c)( 2)
of OMA.

The Board provided this office with all requested materials, and also submitted a

confidential response letter for this office' s review.3 On December 10, 2018, this office sent a
copy of the Board' s non -confidential response to Mr. Thompson and Mr. Egger. Mr. Thompson
replied
Because Mr. Thompson' s
on' the same day; Mr. Egger replied on December 15, 2018.
and Mr. Egger' s Requests for Review allege the same potential OMA violation occurring at the

same closed session meeting, this office has consolidated these matters for determination.
21n addition to the July 12, 2018, meeting, Mr. Egger also sought review of earlier closed session
meetings, alleging that the June 28, 2018, recording indicated repeated violations of OMA during that meeting under
the Board' s previous Interim General Counsel, and that, based on that recording, Mr. Egger suspected a pattern of
improper closed session discussions. However, because Mr. Egger' s Request for Review did not provide any facts
supporting the allegation that the Board may have violated OMA at any other particular meeting, this office
that no further action was

determined

On November

19,

2018, Mr. Thompson submitted another Request for Review in which he' set forth a summary of facts supporting an
allegation that the Board held improper discussions during closed session meetings held on June 1, 2018, and June 7,
2018.

That Request for Review was assigned file number 2018 PAC 55782, and this office determined

that further

inquiry was warranted on those allegations. After this office contacted the Board concerning 2018 PAC 55782, the
Board voluntarily made available to the public portions of the recordings and meeting minutes from those closed
sessions.

concluded that " the General Assembly did not intend to permit public bodies to hold general
discussions concerning categories of employees in closed session pursuant to section 2( c)( 1)."

Although budgetary considerations may impact the employment of certain personnel, closed

again from 1: 24: 30 through 1: 46: 38, the Board discussed a third specific employee. The Board

also discussed performance issues concerning employees in a specific department from the time
3: 48 through 6: 32. All of these discussions fall within the scope of the section 2( c)( 1) exception.

The entirety of the Board' s discussion, however, did not stay within the scope of
the section 2( c)( 1)

exception, as other portions did not center on specific employees.

management issues, alignment, reporting, and personnel budgeting, rather than the merits and
conduct of individual employees.

To the extent that the Board may have mentioned the names of

specific employees during these time periods, our review indicates those references served to
provide examples

of the classes in which those employees

were situated;

the Board' s discussion

did not distinguish those employees by conduct or merit, or in any other way, from other
employees within the same class who were not specifically mentioned. Accordingly, the Public
Access Bureau concludes that these portions of the closed session were not authorized by section

collective bargaining requires that certain phases of the negotiating process must be conducted
privately."

In Binding Opinion 15- 007, the Attorney General addressed the question of

whether a County Board' s closed session discussion of a potential employee hiring freeze fell
within the scope of section
2( c)( 2) of OMA. Ill. Att'y Gen. Pub. Acc. Op. No. 15- 007, issued
September 16, 2015, at 6- 7. The County Board had argued that it was permitted to discuss the

hiring freeze in closed session because the majority of the employees that would be affected
were covered under collective bargaining agreements, but also acknowledged that the County
was not in active negotiations with its collective bargaining units at the time of the discussion.
Based on her review of the records from that closed session, the Attorney General determined
that the

County

Board' s discussion

was

not

authorized

by

section

2(

c)(

2), as that exception " does

not encompass a discussion of unilateral budgetary actions that would affect members of
collective
bargaining units outside of active or imminent collective bargaining." I11. Att' y Gen.
Pub. Acc. Op. No. 15- 007, issued September 16, 2015, at 7.
Based on the recording of the closed session of the July 12, 2018, Board meeting
provided to this office, the Board' s discussion there similarly concemed possible unilateral
budgetary and employee management actions rather that collective negotiating issues. Neither
the Board' s confidential nor non -confidential response to the Requests for Review claim that the

University was engaged in the negotiating process with its employees or their union. The
recording itself also contains no references to active or imminent collective bargaining.
Furthermore, as explained above, the discussions during the closed session meeting concern
management, alignment, reporting, and budgeting issues for specific departments and categories
of employees. Although many of the employees in those departments and categories may be
covered by collective bargaining agreements, the Board' s discussions concerned possible
unilateral actions by the Board rather than collective negotiating matters with the employees'
union. Accordingly, the Public Access Bureau concludes that the remaining portions of the
closed session were not authorized by the section 2( c)( 2) exemption.
Because we have determined that the discussions held from 1: 50 through 3: 48,
6: 32 through 15: 56, 21: 45 through 24: 52, 24: 53 through 36: 23, and 1: 21: 24 through 1: 24: 29

were not permitted by either of the closed session exceptions cited by the Board, the Public
Access Bureau determines that the Board violated section 2( a) of OMA by improperly closing
these discussions to the public. To remedy this violation, this office asks that the Board vote to

release to Mr. Thompson and Mr. Egger, and make publicly available, the above -referenced
portions of the closed session verbatim recording of its July 12, 2018, meeting. The remaining
portions

RE: OMA Request for Review —2018 PAC 53702

and Mr. Crowley:
This determination letter is issued pursuant to section 3. 5( e) of the Open Meetings

Act ( OMA) ( 5 1LCS 120/ 3. 5(

e) (

West

2016)).

For the reasons that follow, the Public Access

Bureau concludes that the Board of Education ( Board) of Elmhurst Community Unit School
District No. 205 ( School District) did not hold an unauthorized

discussion

in closed session

during its April 24, 2018, meeting.
BACKGROUND

On June 22, 2018,

submitted a Request for Review to the Public

Access Bureau alleging that the Board potentially violated OMA during its April 24, 2018,
meeting by improperly discussing a matter in closed session that was outside the scope of the

OMA exceptions that the Board cited as its basis for closing the meeting. Specifically,
pointed to the agenda item " Adoption of Resolution Authorizing Reduction in Force and Recall
of Educational Support Personnel"

500

under section 11 of the agenda, which was titled " Approval of

t

contended that "[

d] ue to its placement in Section 11 of the

agenda, one may conclude that this agenda item was discussed inclosed session." 2
alleged that the resolution " did not concern specific employees of the School District, but rather

a broad group of Instructional Assistant—Reading employees." 3 He referred this office to the
meeting' s minutes, which state that the Board approved the resolution in an effort " to continue

moving forward with the District' s mission, vision and goals regarding how instruction is
provided to students in the District. The District is moving to a push -in model of reading
instruction and will no longer be pulling students from core academic instruction to receive
support.
The minutes further state that "[ n] o person on this list currently employed by the
District is losing a job" and that the individuals would retain their employment.'

contended that the closed session discussion " did not appear to have covered the relative merits

of OMA ( 5 ILCS

concerns." 6

On July 3, 2018, this office forwarded a copy of the Request for Review to the
Board and asked it to respond in writing to the allegations in
Request for Review. This

office also asked the Board to provide copies of the meeting agenda, minutes ( both open and
closed), and closed session verbatim recording for this office' s confidential review. On July 18,

For the reasons thatfollow, the. Public Access

meetings, the Board of Trustees ( Board) of Western Illinois University ( University) improperly
discussed certain matters which were outside the scope of the exceptions to the general

requirement that public bodies conduct business openly.

concludes that because these alleged violations occurred in closed session, they could not have
been discovered

within

60 days

by

a person

using

reasonable

diligence.

Mr. Thompson

discovered the alleged violations within two years of the meeting, and filed this Request for
Review within 60 days of that discovery. Therefore, this Request for Review was filed within
the

statutory time limitation.

See 5 ILCS 120/ 3. 5(

a) (

West 2016).

On November 29, 2018, this office sent a copy of the Request for Review to the
Board and asked it to provide this office with copies of the closed session minutes and closed
session verbatim recordings of the June 1, 2018, and June 7, 2018, meetings for this office' s
review, together with a written response to Mr. Thompson' s allegations.

On December 21, 2018, the Board responded, stating that it would voluntarily
make available portions of the recordings and meeting minutes from the above -referenced closed

session meetings. The Board contended that the remainder of the discussions during those
meetings were authorized by the closed session exceptions and provided further explanation in

its confidential response letter to this office. 2 On February 26, 2019, this office sent a copy of

the Board' s non -confidential response to Mr. Thompson. On March 1, 2019, the Board stated

that it had voluntarily posted redacted copies of the closed session recordings on the University' s
website. In a March 27, 2019, telephone conversation with the Public Access Counselor, Mr.

Thompson requested that this office continue its review of the entireties of the closed session
recordings of both meetings.

The Board made the recording of portions of its June 28, 2018, closed session meeting available
to Mr.' Thompson on November 5, 2018, in compliance with the Attorney General' s Binding Opinion 18- 012, which
determinedthat portions of the Board' s discussion at that meeting were not permitted by the closed session
exceptions to the Open Meetings Act. 111. Atty Gen. Pub. Acc. Op. No. 18- 012, issued October 2, 2018.

Because the Board' s detailed response was provided to this office under a claim of
confidentiality, this office is not at liberty to discuss in this determination the Board' s explanation

of the applicability of the section 2( c)( 29) exception to the brief discussion that occurred during
the June 7, 2018, closed session. However, based on this office' s confidential review of the

closed session verbatim recording from that meeting, the Board' s discussion from 19: 00 to 22: 37
concerned meetings about intemai control weaknesses ' between the University' s auditor and the

Board' s Audit Committee. Accordingly, the Public Access Bureau concludes that that portion of

the closed session was authorized by section 2( c)( 29) of OMA.

The Board has acknowledged that the remaining portions of the June 1, 2018, and

June 7, 2019, closed session discussions were not perrr} itted under any closed session exception.

Accordingly, the Public Access Bureau determines that the Board violated section 2( a) of OMA
by improperly closing these discussions to the public. The Board has remedied these violations
by making publicly available those referenced portions. To remedy the improper discussion

after the alleged violation, by a person utilizing reasonable

allegedly violated OMA. This office has reviewed the materials provided in your Request for

While the e- mail indicates that a PPLC meeting was planned for February 8.

or provided any facts supporting a claim that the PPLC ended up holding an improper meeting

on that particular

and/ or

any

Further, you have not provided any

additional details regarding the alleged improper PPLC meetings, such as the matters that were

discussed during those particular meetings or the status of the committee at the time of the
planned February 8, 2019, meeting. Absent additional information supporting the allegation that
the PPLC held one or more meetings that were improperly closed to the public, this office has an
insufficient basis to take further action with regard to your claims concerning that committee.
As to the LSC, you have alleged that you were denied an opportunity to speak
during the open forum portion of two council meetings, but similarly have not identified the
specific

dates

on

which

those

two meetings

occurred.

You also have not identified the dates of

the meetings that students or other members of the public were allegedly prevented from
attending. Although you provided this office with copies of the agendas for certain LSC
meetings, those agendas reflect. meetings that occurred more than 60 days before the date of the
submission of your Request for Review. As discussed above,' a Request for Review must be
submitted within 60 days after the alleged violation occurred unless the person did not discover

facts concerning the alleged violation within those 60 days despite utilizing reasonable diligence.
Here, you have not provided information demonstrating that you were unable to discover any

alleged OMA violations with regard to those meetings within the 60 days after they were held

therefore, the minutes were improperly approved.
Section 2. 02(
part: "[

a)

of

OMA ( 5 ILCS 120/ 2. 02(

a) (

West 2016)) provides, in pertinent

a] n agenda for each regular meeting shall be posted at the principal office of the public

body and at the location where the meeting is to be held at least 48 hours in advance of the
holding of the meeting." ( Emphasis added.) Based on the plain language of section 2. 02( a), the
City Council must post notices and agendas for its meetings at least 48 hours in advance of its

regular meetings. No provision of OMA, however, requires the City Council to publicly post
informational meeting

packets

in

addition

to meeting

notices

and

agendas.

Further, section

2. 06( b) of OMA requires meeting minutes to be open to the public only after the minutes have
been approved by the public body. Therefore, even if the City Council chooses to publicly post
informational meeting packets, it is not required to include draft meeting minutes within those
informational

packets. -

In its response to this office, the City explained that City Council members have
continuous electronic access to draft meeting minutes through the City' s legislative management

software. It asserted that even if the draft December 10, 2018, meeting minutes were not
included in the publicly posted informational packets, the software provided Council members
with the opportunity to review the minutes before approving them at the January 14, 2019,
meeting.

Based on the information provided by
and the City, this office has no
basis on which to conclude that the City Council members did not review the draft December 10,
2018, meeting minutes prior to approving them. Accordingly, this office concludes that
allegations concerning the City Council' s approval of the December 10, 2018, meeting
minutes

are

unfounded.

Posting of December 10, 2018, Minutes
2. 06( b)

Section

of

OMA ( 5 ILCS 120/ 2. 06( b) ( West 2016))

provides:

A public body shall approve the minutes of its open

meeting within 30 days after that meeting or at the public body' s
second subsequent regular meeting, whichever is later. The
minutes of meetings open to the public shall be available for
public inspection

within

10 days after the approval

of such

minutes by the public body. A public body that has a website
that the full- time staff of the public body maintains shall post the
minutes of a regular meeting of its governing body open to the
public on the public body' s website within 10 days after the
approval
of the minutes
by the public body. ( Emphasis added.)
In its response to this office, the City acknowledged that the minutes for the

December 10, 2018, meeting were inadvertently posted to the City's website fourteen days after
the minutes were approved, which is outside of the scope of the above- cited posting requirement.

The City, however, asserted that while its practice is to comply with the posting
requirements

of section 2. 06( b) of OMA, it is not required to do so because its website is not

maintained by full- time staff. The City' s response also stated that the meeting minutes for the

December 14, 2018, meeting were timely available for the public to view in a physical format.
In his reply,
challenges the City's interpretation of section 2. 06( b) of pmA, stating
t] he ACT does not require a ' full time dedicated' person to man or operate the website, only the

full time staff." 1 In an April 15, 2019, e- mail with an Assistant Attorney General in the Public
Access Bureau, the City Clerk confirmed that no full- time staff member of the City maintains its
website.
Instead, she stated that. the City' s website is maintained by a third -party website
maintenance provider, and explained that certain City employees, such as the City Clerk and the

Deputy Clerk, are permitted to post agendas and meeting minutes for the City Council on the
City' s website because they have been authorized to do by the City' s information technology

department, but she indicated that these employees do not maintain the City' s website.
The above- cited provision of OMA is clear and unambiguous: the City Council is
only required to post minutes on the City' s website if the website is maintained by full- time staff

of the public body. Here, because the City Council' s website is not maintained by full- time staff
of the public body, this office concludes that the posting of the meeting minutes for the City

RE: OMA Request for Review — 2019 PAC 57490

Dear•

The Public Access Bureau has received your Request for Review alleging a
Open Meetings Act ( OMA) ( 5 ILCS 120/ 1 et seg. ( West 2016)) by the Glenwood
Village Planning Commission ( Commission) with respect to the minutes of its October 2018,
violation of the

meeting. This office' s review of the information you have furnished, however, provides no basis
for this office. to conclude that the Commission violated OMA.

On March 30, 2019, you submitted this Request for Review alleging that the

Commission lacked minutes for its October 2018 meeting. Section 2. 06( b) of OMA ( 5 ILCS
120/ 2. 06( b) ( West 2016)) provides, in pertinent part:

A public body shall approve the minutes of its open

meeting within 30 days after that meeting or at the public body' s
second subsequent regular meeting, whichever is later. The
minutes of meetings open to the public shall be available

for public

inspection within 10 days after the approval of such minutes by the
public

body. ( Emphasis added.)

Your Request for Review included correspondence from Glenwood Village
Administrator Brian Mitchell, who indicated that no minutes existed for the Commission' s
October 2018, meeting. On April 1. 7, 2019, a Supervising Attorney in the Public Access Bureau

Thus, the available information indicates that the Commission has not yet held a

second subsequent meeting since its October 2018 meeting. Under the plain language of section
2. 06( b), a public body is not required to approve minutes of a meeting until " 30 days after that
meeting or at the public body' s second subsequent regular meeting, whichever is later."
Accordingly, your claim that the Commission violated OMA by failing to approve minutes of its

October 2018 meeting is unfounded.

Section

3. 5(

in pertinent

part:

A person who believes that a violation of this Act by a

public body has occurred may file a request for review with the
Public Access Counselor established in the Office of the Attorney
General

not

later 60 days

after

the

alleged

OMA

violation.

If

facts concerning the violation are not discovered within the 60 -

day period, but are discovered at a later date, not exceeding 2
years after the alleged violation, by a person utilizing
reasonable diligence, the request for review may be made
within 60 days of the discovery of the alleged violation.
Emphasis added.)

You submitted this Request for Review on April 11, 2019. The February 8, 2019,

special meeting, therefore, occurred more than 60 days before you filed this Request for Review.
Section 3. 5( a) of OMA does permit a person to file a Request for Review within 60 days of

discovering an alleged violation, for up to two years after the date of the alleged violation, but

only if the person did not discover facts concerning the alleged violation within 60 days after it
allegedly occurred despite using reasonable diligence.
Your Request for Review did not provide any facts from which this office could
conclude that you did not discover the alleged February 8, 2019, violation within 60 days after
that meeting despite using reasonable diligence. On the contrary, you acknowledge that you
attended the February 8, 2019, special meeting. Therefore, you would have been aware of the
facts concerning the OMA violations that you described in connection with that special meeting
at the time of the meeting. Because the statutory deadline for filing a Request for Review
expired before you submitted your allegations concerning the Board' s February 8, 2019, special
meeting, section 3. 5( a) of OMA precludes the Public Access Counselor from reviewing those
allegations.

This office will take no further action in this matter, and this file is closed.

This determination is issued pursuant to section 3. 5( b) of the Open Meetings
Act ( OMA) ( 5 ILCS 120/ 3. 5( b) ( West 2016)),

For the. reasons explained below, this office has

determined that no further action is wan -anted in this matter.

On April 1, 2019, you submitted this Request for Review alleging that the

Pleasant Plains Community Unit School District No. 8 ( District) Board of Education ( Board)
violated OMA. You assert that, based on the Board' s responses to this office concerning
Requests for Review that you previously filed, you believe the minutes of the Board' s closed
sessions during its meetings from ' July through December, 2018, indicate that the Board had
improper discussions in closed session. Specifically, you state that the Board:
H] as resorted to concealing discussions that exceed cited

exception from not only the public, but from those who are
authorized with determining if there is a basis for further inquiry
over an executive session due to a Request for Review.
It is apparent due to' the information above [ OMA Requests for
Review —2018 PAC 52862, 54938], that what was documented in

executive session meeting minutes of the February, April, and July
2018 executive session, served to conceal district business

July through December, 2018.
Section

of

Your allegation that the Board' s closed

session meeting minutes conceal improper discussions that took place during each of its
meetings from July through December 2018, meetings is speculative and the information that
you provided does not support that broad assertion.

The amount or percentage of governmental funding of a private

Act. Although the Act itself provides tI)at a particular entity need

not be publically funded in order to be required to hold open
meetings, it does not state that public funding alone will make a
particular entity subject to the Act. Rockford, 64 I11. App. 3d at 96.
In Hopf v. Topcorp, the Illinois Appellate, Court also considered whether a
corporation that was created by the City of Evanston iii conjunction with Northwestern
University to develop a research park was subject to the requirements of FOIA and OMA, using
the factors set forth -in Rockford. Hopf, 256 I11. App. 3d at 889. The corporation, Topcorp, 'Inc.;

was created

while

its subsidiary, Research Park, Inc. ( RPI); was created to

operate, market, and promote interest in the park. Hopf, 256 Ill. App: 3d at 889- 90. The City

and Northwestern equally shared the operating costs of Topcorp and RPI and each guaranteed
half of a $ 300, 000 loan obtained by RPI. Hopf, 256 111. App. 3d at 89L The City and.

each asserted that the Corporation is a public body
because it is either fully funded by or receives substantial funding from the Village. The
Corporation and the Village are parties to an operating agreement that provides for the funding

of the Corporation by the Village at regular intervals. 24 However, no provision of the operating
agreement provides the Village with the ability to directly control the Corporation' s operations or
its

disbursement of the Corporation' s funds, and sets the expenditure authority of the Corporation' s
Executive Director. 25
Under the first factor, the Corporation has a legal existence as a not- for- profit
corporation that is independent of the Village, which the court in Rockford determined to be an

extremely significant factor. With respect to the nature of the functions it performs, the
Corporation' s activities connected• to the expansion of the tax base in the Village and the

Concerning the degree of
by the Village over the Corporation, the Corporation does not appear to be
subject to direct governmental control by the Village because the Governmental Directors that
represent -the Village do not constitute a majority of the members Board or the Executive
Committee. See O' Toole v. Chicago Zoological Society, 2015 IL 118254, 126; 39 N. E. 3d 946,

addition, Mone of the Corporation' s employees or contracted agents are employees of the Village.

Although the Village has three representatives on the Corporation' s Board and is undoubtedly
closely tied to the Corporation, there is no indication that the Village has the ability or the
authority. to

the

Corporation'

s operations.

Lastly, as stated in Rockford and in Hopf,

because there is insufficient evidence of day- to- day governmental control of the Corporation by
the Village, the amount of funding of the Corporation by the Village, even though it is

substantial, is not determinative of whether the Corporation is a subsidiary body of the Village.

Although the parties in this matter focused on the factors used to assess whether

an entity is a subsidiary body, this office notes that advisory bodies are also identified in. section
2( a) of FOIA and section 1. 02 of OMA as public bodies subject to the Act.
In University

Professionals of Illinois, Local 4100 of the Illinois Federation of Teachers v. Stukel, 344 111.

3d 856 ( 1st Dist. 2003), the plaintiff alleged that a group of presidents and chancellors of
universities (
Council), which made recommendations to the Illinois Board of Higher

Education ( IBHE),

violated OMA by meeting privately before 1BHE meetings to discuss issues

related to funding for public education because it constituted an advisory body. Stukel, 344 I11.
App.' 3d at 858. In holding that the Council was not an advisory body for purposes of OMA, the
court considered the following factors to be relevant to that assessment:

1] who appoints the members of the entity, the formality of their
appointment,

and

whether

they

are

for

paid

their

tenure; [ 2] the

entity' s assigned duties, including duties reflected in the entity' s
bylaws or authorizing statute; [ 3] whether its role is solely advisory
or

whether

it. also has

a

deliberative

or

investigative

function; [ 4]

whether the entity is subject to government control or otherwise
accountable

to

any

public

body; [ 5] whether the group has a

budget; [

6] its place within the larger organization or institution of
which it is a part; and [ 7] the impact of decisions or

recommendations that the group makes. Stukel, 344 Ill. App. 3d at
858. •

These factors have significant overlap with the Rockford factors, as both sets
examirie the independence of the entities and the role that they play in the transaction of public

business: The Corporation stated that it assists the Village with evaluating Requests for
Proposals

related to the

development

of

Village -owned

parcels.

In addition, the Corporation' s

mission enables it to make recommendations to the Village concerning economic development
incentive requests.
However, neither the operating agreement nor the other information provided
to this office indicates that the Corporation is assigned, particular duties by the Village related to
development of Village property or incentive requests, has a formal place within the structure of

the Village, or makes binding recommendations to the Village. Therefore, having reviewed the
information presented by the parties in light of the relevant factors set out in Rockford and in

Stukel, on balance, this office concludes that the Corporation is a not a subsidiary or an advisory
body subject to the requirements of FOIA or OMA.
Section 7( 2)

asserted that records responsive to his FOIA request in the possession of
the Corporation are records of the Village pursuant to section 7( 2) of FOIA, which provides:
A public record that is not in the possession of a public

body but is in the possession of a party with whom the agency has

function and is not otherwise exempt under this Act, shall .be

considered a public record of the public body, for purposes of this
Act. ( Emphasis

added.)

In its written answer to this office, the Village asserted that records in the
possession of the Corporation were not subject to disclosure in response to a FOIA request to the

Village because the Corporation " is not a subsidiary body of the Village, and the Village has not

contracted with the [ Corporation]. to perform governmental functions or perform anything that
directly relates to governmental function on behalf of the Village." 27 The Village further

t] he requested records are regarding a private development and the [ Corporation' s]
private communications as an Illinois not- for- profit corporation regarding that development. The
asserted

that "[

requested records do not touch upon the Village' s governmental functions." 28 In response to this

office' s request for additional information concerning the Corporation, the Village stated. that
pursuant to the operating agreement, it was " the Village's understanding that the Corporation
would take cold calls from developers and initiate confacts with developers' in general for the
development of any parcels in the Village and would refer potential developers to applicable

private property owners." 29

OMA) ( 5 1LCS

For the reasons explained below, the Public Access

DETERMINATION

It is the " public policy of this State that its citizens shall be given advance notice
of and the right to attend all meetings at which any business of a public body is discussed or
acted

upon

in any way." 5 ILCS 120/ 1 ( West 2016). " The Open Meetings Act provides that

public agencies exist to aid in the conduct of the people' s business, and that the intent of the, Act

is to assure that agency actions be taken openly and that their deliberations be conducted
openly."

Gosnell v. Hogan, 179 111. App. 3d 161, 171 ( 5th Dist. 1989).
Section 2. 02( a)

of

OMA ( 5 ILCS I20/ 2. 02(

a) (

West 2016)) requires an agenda for

each regular meeting to be posted at the principal office of the public body and at the location
where the meeting is to be held at least 48 hours in advance of the holding of the meeting, and
further provides: " A public body that has a website that the full- time staff of the public body
maintains shall also post on its website the agenda of any regular meetings of the governing body
of

that public

body."

Section

2. 02( b)

of

OMA ( 5 ILCS

120/ 2. 02( b) ( West 2016)) adds that " a

public body that has a website that the full- time staff of the public body maintains shall post
notice on its website of all meetings of the governing body of the public body."

When construing the meaning of a statute, the primary objective is to ascertain the
intent

of

the legislature.

See,

e. g.,

DeLuna

v.

Burciaga,

223 III. 2d 49, 59 ( 2006).

A statute

should not be construed in a way that would defeat its purpose or yield an absurd or unjust result.
Phoenix Bond & Indemnity Co. v, Pappas, 194 111. 2d 99, 106 ( 2000).
Request for Review alleges that the Board violated OMA by failing.
to post a copy of its June 20, 2018, budget hearing meeting on the District' s website. The
Board' s response to this office acknowledged

that it did not post the agenda online, but explained

that the District' s website is not maintained by a full- time staff member during the summer
months when the District is not in session. The Board explained that during the school year,

until May 21, 2018, Mr. Woodley was a full- time technology specialist with responsibility for
maintaining the District' s website. The Board stated that from May 21, 2018, until August 17, ,

2018, Mr. Woodley' s hours were reduced and he was only a part- time technology specialist. Mr.
Thill and Mr. Woodley' s affidavits affirmed that the District' s website was not maintained by a
full- time staff member from May 21, 2018, to August 17, 2018. Further, the Board has
confirmed that the agenda for the June 20, 2018, budget hearing was properly posted at the
Board'

s principal

office

and

meeting

location

at

least 48 hours before the meeting

 The Honorable

Chad Bremmer

April 23, 2019
Page 3

In a similar Request for Review previously submitted by

this office

determined that the Board was not required to post an agenda on the District' s website because

the website was not maintained by its full- time staff. III. Att'y Gen. PAC Req. Rev. Ltr. 48553,
issued October 10, 2017, at 2. In her reply to this office,
distinguishes the current
matter on the basis that the Board has acknowledged that it employs a full- time staff member for
part of the year to maintain its website.

However, the plain language of the above- cited

provisions of OMA expressly require the posting of the agenda on a public body' s website only if
its full- time staff "maintains" the website. The word " maintains" is in the present tense, which

indicates that the full- time staff must maintain the website at the time of the relevant meeting.
See Hayashi v. Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation, 2014 IL 116023,
1116, 25 N. E. 3d 570, 576 ( 2013) ( Where the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, a

reviewing body " may not depart from the plain language by reading into the statute exceptions,
limitations, or conditions that the legislature did not express."). Accordingly, because the
District did not employ a full- time staff member in June 2018, to maintain its website, the
District was not required to post its agendas to the District' s website.

reply also disputes the District' s statement that its website is not
maintained by a full- time staff member during the summer months. She appears to question

whether Mr. Woodley' s responsibilities include website maintenance, but she does not indicate
what other full- time employee has responsibility for maintaining the website. She suggests that
the Superintendent
the

technology

has website maintenance

coordinator

for the District,

responsibilities
but her

because of a stipend he received as

assertion

is

speculative.

also

contends that the Board never approved Mr. Woodley' s part- time employment arrangement for
the summer months. Although OMA generally requires public bodies to conduct public business
openly, the Act does not require public bodies to take action on administrative matters such as

the scheduling and employment of public employees. See III.. Att'y Gen. PAC Req. Rev. Ltr.
48267, issued June 23, 2017, at 2 ( concluding that OMA does. not govern the firing of an
employee by a village' s president when the president did not first advise, and receive approval
from, the

village' s

board

of

trustees).

In sum,

has not provided evidence to support

her assertion that Mr. Woodley did not maintain the website on a part- time basis in June 2018.
reply also asserts that because the Board posted on the District' s

website the agenda for its June 20, 2018, regular meeting, it was also required to post the agenda
for the June 20, 2018, budget hearing. As discussed above, section 2. 02( b) of OMA
unambiguously provides that a public body such as the Board is only required to post agendas on
its website if the website is maintained by full- time staff of the public body. Accordingly, this
office concludes that the Board did not violate the advance notice requirements
connection

with

its June 20, 2018, budget

hearing.

This determination letter is issued pursuant to section 3. 5( e) of the Open Meetings
Act ( OMA) ( 5 ILCS 120/ 3. 5(

e) (

For the reasons that follow, the Public Access

Bureau concludes that, based on the available information, the Board of Trustees ( Board) of the
Village of Norridge ( Village) did not violate the requirements of OMA in connection with a

March 13, 2018, gathering.
BACKGROUND

On March 20, 2018, Mr. Adam Chudzik submitted a Request for Review to the

Public Access Bureau alleging that the Board violated the requirements of OMA on March 13,
2018, when four trustees attended a meeting at Eisenhower Public Library. He contended that

that the discussion of this meeting was the transfer of public funds from the Village of Norridge
to another public body. This is clearly 'public business' and in the public interest."'
On March 22, 2018, this office forwarded a copy of the Request for Review to the

Board and asked it to respond in writing to the allegations in Mr. Chudzik' s Request for Review.
If the Board asserted that the gathering did not constitute a " meeting" subject to the requirements
of OMA, this office asked it to provide an explanation of the purpose of the gathering and to

identify the Board members who attended. On March 27, 2018, this office received a written
response from the Board. On April 2, 2018, this office forwarded a copy of the Board' s response
to Mr. Chudzik; he replied on April 9, 2018.

It is the public policy of this State that its citizens shall be given advance notice

The Open Meetings Act provides that

public agencies exist to aid in the conduct of the people' s business, and that the intent of the Act

is to assure that agency actions be taken openly and that their deliberations be conducted
openly." Gosnell v. Hogan, 179 Ill. App. 3d 161, 171 ( 5th Dist. 1989).
Section 2( a)

of

OMA ( 5 ILCS 120/ 2( a) ( West 2017

provides

that "[ a] lI

there was no evidence that a majority of a quorum of the members engaged in any further

In its response to this office, the Board denied Mr. Chudzik' s claim that it held a

meeting on March 13, 2018, for the purpose of discussing public business. The Board stated that
Mr. Chudzik did not attend the meeting, which " was held by the members of School District 80' s
The
Save the Band' committee at the Eisenhower Library, and not the Village of Norridge."'
Board

acknowledged

that four trustees— a

quorum

of the

Board—

attended the gathering, but

argued that they " were at this meeting as individual residents of the Village of Norridge' s District
80 to see what the committee was doing to help save the band. No Village business was
conducted." 3

to that

answer,

Mr. Chudzik

contended

that "[

Village' s " 2018 State of the Village" statement, which discussed the " Save the District 80 Band

Program" campaign. The paragraph highlighted by Mr. Chudzik described the " Save the District
80 Band Program" campaign as a fundraising effort headed by a group of parents and community
members to reinstate the school band program, which had been eliminated due to budget
constraints; the paragraph provided details on how to get involved in the campaign or donate to
it.

and that it advertised the " Save the

Band" fundraising efforts on its website and Facebook pages He contended, in relevant part:
Even if no final action was taken at the meeting in question, there
was a discussion regarding Village resources. And considering the
fact that the Village of Norridge has partnered with Norridge

School District 80' s ' Save the Band' committee to raise funds, any

meeting with a ' quorum' of officials with the ' Save the Band'
committee should be considered public business. 161
In this matter, the Village confirmed that a quorum of the Board attended a

meeting of the " Save the Band" community group at the Eisenhower Library on March 13, 2018.
The parties do not dispute that the gathering pertained to the " Save the District 90 Band
Program"

campaign.

While Mr. Chudzik contended that there was a discussion concerning

Village resources at the gathering in question, he did not provide additional details regarding the
four trustees' alleged participation in the gathering or other information indicating that they
collectively engaged in deliberative discussions about the transfer of Village funds to the
campaign. He also did not contest the Village' s, assertion that he did not attend the gathering, nor
did he provide information

sufficient to corroborate

his allegations

about what transpired

there.'

Although the cited excerpt from the " 2018 State of the Village Statement" publicizes and
expresses support for the campaign, it does not provide evidence that the trustees engaged in

conduct at the March 13, 2018, gathering which constituted a " meeting" of the Board under the
definition of that term in OMA. The Village contended that the four trustees who attended the

gathering did so as individual school district residents rather than in their capacities as members
of the Board, and that they attended to learn more about the group' s activities. Accordingly,
based on the available

information,

this office is unable to conclude

that the March

13, 2018,

gathering was a meeting of the Board subject to the requirements of OMA.
