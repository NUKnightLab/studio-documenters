APPLICATION NUMBER 19-6256
ADDRESS: 2010 ATKINSON
HISTORIC DISTRICT: ATKINSON AVENUE.
APPLICANT: KEISHA MCKINNEY
DATE OF STAFF VISIT: 06-21-2019

PREPARED BY: B. CAGNEY

PROPOSAL
The building at 2010 Atkinson Avenue is a brick, 2-1/2 story, Prairie style, single-family home. The home
has a balanced front façade with a simple covered porch on the east side and four windows grouped
together on the west side. The second floor window openings are symmetrically arranged and retain
ornamental storm shutters. The hip-roof has a dormer on the south façade and east faces The applicant
states that the home currently has a mix of original wood windows and replacement vinyl windows. At
some point, the rear sun room was clad in aluminum siding. The concrete patio on the rear of the home has
decayed beyond repair. It is unclear when the detached garage was removed. HDC records have no COA’s
on file for this work, although it appears to have happened before the current home owners purchased the
property.
HDC staff has been working with the applicant in their effort to rehabilitate the home over the last two
months. On 5-13-2019, staff issued a Certificate of Appropriateness to remove and replace the asphalt
shingle roof. On 5-23-2019, staff issued a COA for the following items: restore the front porch in-kind, to
replace the concrete driveway to match the existing footprint, remove and replace the gutter system to
match existing and to construct an 8’ pressure treated pine panel fence along the rear property line (alley)
that matches the adjacent fence style.
The applicant seeks the Commission’s approval to continue the rehabilitation of the home with the
following proposed items:
• Replace all original windows (16) and vinyl replacement windows (2)
o Proposed: Royal Plus II double-hung, single-pane windows (vinyl)
• Remove the existing rear doorway (kitchen) and infill with matching brick
• Remove (3) windows (wood) & Create new doorway into sunroom at same location
o Proposed: Mastercraft French Patio Door with Exterior Grilles, 72" W x 80"
• Replace exterior siding
o Proposed Material Unspecified, location unspecified
• Demolish deteriorated concrete porch (rear)
• Build new wood deck / porch
o Treated wood, 22’x 12’
• Build 20’x20’ two car garage
o Roof shingles to match home
o Siding to match home
o As shown in submitted rendering

 ELEMENTS OF DESIGN
(3)

Proportion of openings within the facade. Window openings are almost always taller than wide; several
windows are sometimes grouped into combinations wider than tall. Window openings are always
subdivided, the most common window type being double hung sash, whose area is sometimes further
subdivided by muntins. Facades have approximately fifteen (15) to thirty-five (35) per cent of their area
glazed. Dormer windows exist in a variety of shapes and sizes.

(7)

Relationship of materials. The major building materials in the district are brick and stucco, sometimes
used in combination, wooden functional trim and window frames and sash are common, and wood is
used in many examples as decorative trim as well. Wood sheathing is occasionally used on the attic
story and/or dormers. Stone is occasionally used as a material for window sills, porch trim and other
functional trim. Roughcut stone is the main material used on a rustic porch in the district. Roofing
materials include asphalt shingles, slate, and Mediterranean tiles, asphalt shingles being by far the
primary roofing material in the district.

(10)

Relationship of architectural detail These generally relate to style; neo-Georgian and Colonial revival
buildings display classical details, mostly in wood. Areas commonly but not always treated are porches,
shutters, window frames, cornices, and dormer windows. Details on Mediterranean style or vernacular
buildings include arched windows, door openings, and porches. Buildings of medieval inspiration tend
to have details in the form of half-timbering and leaded windows. In general, the various houses on
Atkinson Avenue range from scarce to rich in architectural detail.

(13)

Relationship of significant landscape features and surface treatments. The typical treatment of
individual properties is a flat or slightly graded front lawn area in grass turf, subdivided by a walk,
usually straight but sometimes curving, leading from the curb to the steps of the front entrance. There is
sometimes a sidewalk beginning at the public sidewalk leading to the rear when a driveway does not
exist. Materials for such walks are primarily concrete. Foundation plantings, often of a deciduous
character, are present. Hedges between properties are occasional; few extend along the side yard to the
front lot line. The most prominent type of fences in the district are the chain linked fence and wire mesh
with wooden posts. Fences extending to the front yard are rare; most back yards are fenced. Some
large American elm trees remain on the tree lawns in the district, although they are virtually extinct.
Replacement trees should be characteristic of the era and period in which the houses were built (19151930); if elm, only a disease resistant cultivar would be a practical choice. Many straight side
driveways from the street to the rear yard are present; a common treatment of the surface of the
driveway is two (2) concrete strips with grass in between or all concrete. On comer lots, garages and
driveways face the side streets. Tree lawns along Atkinson are uniformly wide, about eight (8)feet.
Street pavements are asphalt; curbs are concrete. Alleys are also paved in concrete. Lighting poles on
Atkinson are of the wood telephone pole variety.

STAFF OBSERVATIONS:
Windows: Based on the provided information, it is staff’s opinion that the proposed vinyl windows are not
appropriate for the home. Staff is unable to recommend in favor of the current window replacement proposal.
Rear elevation: The applicant proposes to fill in an existing door frame that appears to have been previously
modified. Additionally, the applicant seeks to replace historic rear windows with new French Doors in the sun room.
However, the applicant has not specified any replacement siding material. It is staff’s opinion that the removal of
historic windows to be replaced with the proposed door is not appropriate. Staff is unable to recommend in favor of
the current rear elevation proposal.

 Proposed Deck
HDC staff finds the removal of the deteriorated concrete porch and the construction of a new treated wood deck to
be appropriate. However, staff finds inconsistent dimensions proposed on the submitted site plan when compared to
the deck design submitted after staff requested more detail. Staff recommends approval of the current deck proposal
with the condition that the applicant provides more detailed information is specified about the size.
Proposed Garage
HDC staff finds the erection of a garage in the same footprint of the existing garage to be appropriate. However, no
documentation has been provided about the previous garage, or when it was removed. The current proposal does not
specify height, or siding beyond to match house, which is not specified. Staff recommends approval of the current
garage proposal with the condition that the applicant provides more detailed information, including height, materials,
roof and size. Additionally, staff would like to see specifications for all doors, roofing and siding materials.

RECOMMENDATION (1 of 2)
WINDOWS AND REAR ELEVATION MODIFICATIONS:
It is staff’s recommendation that the Commission do not issue a Certificate of Appropriateness for the proposed
work based on the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation Number 6) Deteriorated historic features
shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive
feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color, texture, and other visual qualities and, where
possible, materials. Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or pictorial
evidence AND 9) New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic
materials that characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be
compatible with the massing, size, scale and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property
and its environment.
RECOMMENDATION (2 of 2)

PROPOSED DECK AND GARAGE:
Staff conditionally recommends that the Commission do not issue a Certificate of Appropriateness for the proposed
work based on the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation Number 9) New additions, exterior
alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The
new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the massing, size, scale and
architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment. This approval is
contingent upon the applicant providing more information to the satisfaction of the Commission regarding the
construction of the porch and garage.
