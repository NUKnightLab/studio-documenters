Re:

Update on Cost of Service Studies for FY 2019 Charges - The Foster Group

Background: Each January, the Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA) members receive a
calculation of the Cost of Service Studies and the resulting proposed charges. This timing is
defined by service contracts as further cited in the attached budget calendar. Those notices
were distributed on January 25, 2018.
Analysis: GLWA’s advisor, The Foster Group, prepares the Cost of Service Studies and
charges based upon several inputs and analysis. Bart Foster, The Foster Group, will be in
present at the Audit Committee meeting to address the status of the Cost of Service study
and charge development as well as unique considerations in the development of the FY
2019 charges. Presentation materials are attached. In addition, the Cost of Services Study
is online at http://www.glwater.org/wholesale-customers/charges/ .
Proposed Action: Receive and file report.

FY 2019 Cost of Service Study /
Charges Results: Executive Summary
•  There are myriad elements that impact the 
cost of service allocations and proposed 
service charges for FY 2019, but there is a 
singular highlight for the Water Charges 
and another for the Sewer Charges 
•  Today’s discussion focuses on those 
highlights for each system

FY 2019 Cost of Service Study /
Charges Results: Executive Summary
•  The proposed Water Charges are materially 
impacted by implementation of the Units of 
Service (UoS) Study for non-master metered 
Customers 
•  The proposed Sewer Charges are materially 
impacted by the allocation of the BUDGET to 
Cost Pools, and specifically those Cost Pools 
that are solely or primarily allocated to 
specific Customers: 
ü Oakland Macomb Interceptor (OMID) – direct to 
OMID 
ü Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO) – 83% to Detroit

FY 2019 Water Cost of Service
Results: Units of Service Study
•  Phase 1 of the UoS Study conducted by Black & 
Veatch establishes observed and estimated “units 
of service” for Detroit, Dearborn, and Highland 
Park, which do not have master “billing” meters 
•  The Phase 1 technical findings were accepted in a 
consensus manner by the One Water Partnering 
Group at its meeting on December 20, 2017 
•  Units of service include: 
ü Average daily demands 
ü Maximum day demands 
ü Peak hour demands 
ü Distance & Elevation factors

•  The GLWA Administrative 
recommendation to implement the UoS 
technical findings for the FY 2019 Charges 
includes modifications to the observed and 
estimated max day and peak hour

FY 2019 Water Cost of Service
Results: Units of Service Study
•  The GLWA Administrative 
recommendation: 
ü Increases max day and peak hour demands for 
Detroit and Highland Park by 10% - similar to 
the approach applied to model contract 
Customers who re-opened during 2017 
ü Increases Dearborn’s max day and peak hour 
demands by 20% - consistent with the manner 
that demands for other Customers under “old” 
contract formats are treated

FY 2019 Sewer Cost of Service
Results: Cost Pool Allocations
•  The nature of these two Customer specific Cost Pools 
are similar, and methods for assigning indirect costs to 
both are under review as part of the Cost Allocation 
Project 
ü Methods of assigning Centralized Services operating expenses, 
etc. 

•  However there are unique circumstances for these two 
Cost Pools: 
ü OMID Cost Pool is related to facilities that entirely serve one 
GLWA Customer, and could arguably be defined as “local” 
facilities for that Customer; 
ü CSO Cost Pool is related to regional facilities that (while 
predominantly allocated to service for one Customer) are still 
a “common to all” wholesale service

FY 2019 Sewer Cost of Service
Results: Cost Pool Allocations
•  The increased allocation of costs to the OMID Cost 
Pool has the effect of increasing the OMID 
Wholesale Service Charge by approximately 2% 
ü This figure is net of the offsetting reduction in costs 
allocable to the CTA Cost Pool.  It is difficult to accurately 
isolate specific impacts of multiple changing assumptions. 

•  The increased allocation of costs to the CSO Cost 
Pool has the effect of increasing the total Detroit 
allocated wholesale sewer revenue requirement by 
approximately 3.5% 
ü This figure is net of the offsetting reduction in costs 
allocable to the CTA Cost Pool. Again, it is difficult to 
accurately isolate specific impacts of multiple changing

FY 2019 Water Cost of Service
Perspectives: Units of Service Study
•  During the review of the UoS Study, the concept of a 
phased approach to implementing the resulting 
impacts was introduced by Detroit and Dearborn 
•  From our perspective, an implementation approach 
that phases in the UoS impacts over a two year 
period may be worthy of consideration 
•  We believe that such an approach recognizes that 
stability is a valued objective, and that further 
unknown cost allocation impacts will occur in the 
near future related to: 
ü Phase 2 of the UoS Study; 
ü Other initiatives that emerge from the Charge 
Methodology Review 
THE

FY 2019 Water Cost of Service
Perspectives: Units of Service Study
•  The two year phased period matches that 
implemented last year by the Board of 
Directors for the Sewer SHAREs, a FY 2018 
“key issue” that had (in broad terms) a 
directionally opposite impact on Sewer 
customer classes compared to the UoS impact 
on Water customer classes 
•  As part of the Charge notification process, 
GLWA notified Customers of two potential 
Scenarios of proposed Charges to Customers 
ü Scenario 1 = full implementation of UoS; 
ü Scenario 2 = 2 year phased implementation

FY 2019 Sewer Cost of Service
Perspectives: Cost Pool Allocations
•  Both of the “Customer specific” Cost Pools are 
experiencing “unique” circumstances with 
respect to the FY 2019 Cost of Service Study, 
reflecting a combination of refined awareness, 
new programs, and the recognition of: 
ü A potential operating agreement between GLWA and 
OMID regarding the Northeast Sewer Pumping 
Station may change the cost dynamics; 
ü The fact that the costs to operate and maintain the 
CSO facilities are “dynamic” and irregular 
THE

TFG
FOSTER GROUP

29

FY 2019 Sewer Cost of Service
Persepectives: Cost Pool Allocations
•  The nature of these two Customer specific Cost Pools 
are similar, and methods for assigning indirect costs to 
both are under review as part of the Cost Allocation 
Project 
ü Methods of assigning Centralized Services operating expenses, 
etc. 

•  However there are unique circumstances for these two 
Cost Pools: 
ü OMID Cost Pool is related to facilities that entirely serve one 
GLWA Customer, and could arguably be defined as “local” 
facilities for that Customer; 
ü CSO Cost Pool is related to regional facilities that (while costs 
are predominantly allocated to one Customer) are still a 
“common to all” wholesale service 
THE

 2/7/18 

FY 2019 Sewer Cost of Service
Perspectives: Cost Pool Allocations
•  We believe that both of these Customer class impacts 
may be well served by the concept of a potential 
“Charge Stability Adjustment” that embraces a notion 
of comparing actual Cost Pool expenditures to budgeted 
amounts 
•  Under this approach, Sewer Service Charges would be 
established at 100% of the BUDGET assigned to the 
Customer specific (OMID / CSO) Cost Pools, with the 
understanding that: 
ü Actual costs to these Cost Pools would be tracked and 
compared to original budgets; 
ü Potentially, adjustments to future charges (for FY 2020 and/or 
beyond) would be made to reflect actual vs. budget 
performance in “Customer specific” Cost Pools 
THE

TFG
FOSTER GROUP

31

FY 2019 Sewer Cost of Service
Perspectives: Cost Pool Allocations
•  We believe that this “Charge Stability Adjustment” 
concept is consistent with the overall equity and 
stability strategy that is fundamental to the GLWA 
Strategic Charge Initiatives 
•  We further believe that the concept may provide a 
valuable tool for GLWA to address potentially 
volatile expenditures in these unique Cost Pools, 
and avoid unintended consequences to the directly 
impacted Customers 
•  We do NOT believe that the notion should be 
applied to budget/actual variances in revenues or 
“CTA SHAREs” revenue requirements 
THE

 2/7/18 

FY 2019 Sewer Cost of Service
Perspectives: Cost Pool Allocations
•  We believe any implementation of the “Charge 
Stability Adjustment” concept will require further 
analysis and policy development, including: 
ü Understanding that the OMID “Charge Stability 
Adjustment” (at least as referenced in this commentary) is 
suggested to be limited to the potential recognition of a 
successfully negotiated operating agreement for the Northeast 
Sewer Pump Station; 
ü Acknowledging that OMID Cost Pool adjustments are 
applicable to the OMID Customer only, while CSO Cost Pool 
adjustments are subject to the 83 / 17 allocation agreement; 
ü Establishing material thresholds for implementing “Charge 
Stability Adjustments”; 
ü Understanding how I&E Funds are generated, included in 
charges, committed, and expended

 AGENDA ITEM #7A

Date: February 9, 2018
To:

Great Lakes Water Authority Audit Committee

From: Nicolette N. Bateson, CPA, Chief Financial Officer/Treasurer
Re:

Review of the Proposed FY 2019 through FY 2023 Capital Improvement Plan

Background: The five-year capital improvement program (CIP) is developed
simultaneously with the five-year financial plan. While the plan is reviewed by the Capital
Improvement Planning Committee, it is also presented to the Audit Committee to ensure
alignment of objectives across the Great Lakes Water Authority. In addition, the CIP is
presented at various stages of development at the customer outreach Asset Management &
CIP Work Group meetings.
Analysis: The proposed capital improvement plan is available online at
http://www.glwater.org/about-us/capital-improvement-planning-committee/. Attached
is the presentation presented to the Asset Management & CIP Work Group Meeting on
Thursday, February 8, 2018. A similar presentation was provided to the GLWA Capital
Improvement Planning Committee at its meeting on Tuesday, February 6, 2018. The
attached presentation will also be reviewed with the Audit Committee.
Proposed Action: Receive and file report.

Project Significance: Project critical to production at Springwells WTP during repurposing of Northeast WTP as recommended bv the 2015 WM PU.

Contract identified problem areas on the raw water supplv svstem that compromised the system's to meet demands
during the repurposing of Northeast WTP.

Project Engineer} Manager: Todd King

Manager: Grant Gartrell

Scope of Work: The scope of work is to conduct supplemental investigations to design the repairs for the sections of tunnel identified in as
having structural concerns. Three areas were identi?ed with the highest concern being a portion of the Springwells Tunnel near the
Springwells 1INTP.

Challenges: The tunnels are approximately; 30 feet below the surface of the Detroit River. This poses challenges for assessing the extent of damage
to the structures, as well as repair. Dewatering the tunnels to repair them will create extensive stresses that must be considered prior
to performing the work. Maintaining a supply:r of raw water to Springwells, Northeast and Water Works Park throughout construction
to meet ?nished water production of the svstem. Specializedfoomplicated construction.

Strategic vs Specific Use of I&E Funds
 Striking the balance between bond proceeds and revenue financed capital will lower the cost of capital over 
the long‐term. 
 Revenue financed capital is budgeted for use only after it is received to minimize financial plan risk. 

 When I&E funds are assigned to offset a portion of the costs of specific capital expenses, a transfer is made 
from the I&E Fund to the Construction Bond Fund.  

 “Transfers from I&E Transfers” are labeled as specific or strategic. 
• “Specific” transfers relate to specifically identified projects (general soft costs for services at the study 
or design phase).  
• “Strategic” relates to outlining the potential use of Revenue Financed Capital to lower the amount of 
revenue bonds.  
 Measuring this effort over time will inform stakeholders of the effectiveness of this approach.

 DWSD Retail Billings: Due to the earlier than normal date of this month’s Audit Committee
meeting, updated DWSD billed usage and billed revenue information for December 2017 were
not available. The December 2017 numbers will be included in next report provided at the
March 2018 Audit Committee meeting.
GLWA Wholesale Customer Billings: Table 1 shows the FY 2018 sewer billed revenue. As a
result of the sewer rate simplification which provides a more stable revenue stream, the
wholesale sewer customers are billed a fixed monthly fee. The results of this effort can be seen
as the billed revenue is at 100.0% of budget through December 2017.
Total System Billings: Table 1 shows the FY 2018 combined DWSD and GLWA Wholesale sewer
billed usage and billed revenue. Based on the combined billings available at the time of this
report, the GLWA Sewer System had billed revenues of 92.21% of budget without the
December 2017 DWSD billings.

2. FY 2018 Retail and Wholesale Water Revenue Report

meeting, updated DWSD billed usage and billed revenue information for December 2017 were
not available. The December 2017 numbers will be included in next report provided at the
March 2018 Audit Committee meeting.
GLWA Wholesale Customer Billings: Table 2 shows the FY 2018 water billed usage and billed
revenues. Starting FY 2016, wholesale water charges were re-structured to create a more stable
revenue stream by using a historical rolling average to project customer volumes and allocating
60% of the customer revenue requirement to the monthly fixed charge. As of December 2017,
the billed usage was at 102.7% of budget and billed revenue at 104.9% of budget. As noted in
Table 2, revenues and usage from the City of Flint are included as they were assumed in the FY
2018 Budget.
Total System Billings: Table 2 shows the FY 2018 combined DWSD and GLWA Wholesale water
billed usage and billed revenue. Based on the combined Retail and Wholesale Water billings,

budget without the December 2017 DWSD billings.

 4. City of Flint Billings and Collections
On October 16, 2015, the City of Flint (“City”) re-joined the regional water system pursuant to a shortterm agreement which was extended several times through November 30, 2017. That agreement
provided for a prepayment fund. In total, GLWA has received over $28.4 million to the prepayment
fund, and as of January 31, 2017, all prepayment funds have been used and the balance in the fund is
$0, as shown in Table 4.
Beginning December 1, 2017, GLWA is now providing water service to Flint in accordance with a new 30year water service agreement. The terms of this agreement provides for the funding of a $3,750,000
Security Deposit account by the City of Flint, which was received by GLWA on January 11, 2018. The
Security Deposit Account may only be drawn down if Flint fails to make full and timely payments. The
agreement also provides for a monthly credit to Flint for its previous month’s debt service payment to
KWA and a pass-through charge to Flint for monthly service provided by GCDC. All monthly payments
by Flint will be deposited with the Trustee, US Bank GLWA, KWA and GCDC per the provisions of the
Baseline Trust.
