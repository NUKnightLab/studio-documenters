Brian Goeken presented the staff report on the proposed 360-square-foot, 59’-5”-high, polemounted, externally-illuminated sponsorship sign in left field bleachers at Wrigley Field.
Chairman Mosena called for questions by the Commission members of Mr. Goeken to clarify
any information presented regarding the staff recommendation and analysis. The applicant,
Tom Ricketts of the Chicago Cubs, then addressed the Commission.

 Chairman Mosena stated for the record that the Commission had received correspondence
from members of the public expressing both support and opposition for the project, and that
the correspondence was incorporated as part of the record for the public meeting. Chairman
Mosena then called for public comment. Forty-six members of the public expressed support
for the proposed sign, one member of the public expressed general concerns, and ten members
of the public expressed opposition. Alderman Thomas Tunney (44th Ward) expressed his
opposition to the proposal.
Chairman Mosena also announced that the Commission had received an Objection and
Motion to Postpone the May 6, 2010 proceedings from attorney Thomas S. Moore on behalf

that since today’s Commission meeting is not a public hearing, the request was inappropriate

of building not proposed at this time); also change to configuration of sixfoot-high masonry wall.

Action:

Approved unanimously as submitted. The pre-permit conditional approval
by the Permit Review Committee, dated November 6, 2008, remains in

constructed at this time (approval expires November 6, 2010).

with a roof deck with visible railings.

profile, lap exposure, and finish. Details of the proposed siding
material shall be included in the permit plans;
The newel posts for the proposed front stair railings shall be at
least 4” x 4” in section in order to more closely resemble the scale
and character of historic newel posts found within the district;
If wood railings are to be used for the roof deck above the rear
addition and the rear garage, they shall be painted or stained in
order to have a more finished appearance compatible with the
district (alternative materials would also be acceptable, subject to
Historic Preservation staff review and approval);
Any structural repair work proposed to the roof shall maintain the
existing ridge, eave heights, roof slopes and dimensions (i.e.,
aligning the top of any new sistered-in structural members with the
top of the existing structural members);
As proposed, the scope of the project includes the removal of the
interior walls and floor framing of the historic building, while the
exterior wall and the roof would remain in place. A report and
drawings by a licensed structural engineer addressing how the
historic building will be supported, braced and protected, in-situ,
during the demolition and construction of the new interior walls
and floor framing, as well as a sequencing plan for the work, shall
be submitted and incorporated into the permit plans;
Should any masonry work be proposed replacement brick shall
match existing in size, finish, color and profile. Landmarks staff
shall review and approve replacement brick prior to order and
installation. Any tuckpointing mortar shall match the original in
type, color and joint profile. Details of brick replacement shall be
included on permit plans. Brick cleaning specifications shall be
submitted with the permit application; and,
The proportions of the proposed front door should observe the
proportions of the existing historic paneled door surround, per
Historic Preservation staff review and approval.
