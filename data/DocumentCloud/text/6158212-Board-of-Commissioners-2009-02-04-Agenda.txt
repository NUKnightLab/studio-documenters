by
LAURA LECHOWICZ FELICIONE, Special Counsel
The City of Chicago has requested Cook County as well as other governmental parties to enter into a
Governmental Cooperation Agreement (“Agreement”) for the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games.
The Cook County Board of Commissioners previously authorized the execution of an Intergovernmental
Agreement with the City of Chicago to utilize County Properties as venues for cycling competitions as
needed during the 2016 Olympic Games; however authorization of the attached Governmental
Cooperation Agreement is a separate agreement entered into between the City of Chicago, and the County
of Cook; Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority; Chicago Park District; Board of Education of the
City of Chicago; Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois; County of Lake; City of Evanston and
Village of Old Mill Creek (“Governmental Parties”) to address guarantees required by the International
Olympic Committee (“IOC”).
The purpose of the Agreement is to (1) establish the roles, responsibilities and financial contributions of
the public authorities in the planning, organizing and staging of the 2016 Games, (2) establish
coordination of the public authorities involved in hosting the 2016 Games, (3) demonstrate to the IOC
that the City and the Governmental Parties are prepared to successfully host the 2016 Games, and (4)
provide certain of the Guarantees requested by the IOC in the IOC Questionnaire, as a material
inducement to the IOC.
The executed Agreement will be forwarded by the City of Chicago to Chicago 2016 for inclusion in
materials being sent to the IOC at the end of January. Due to the necessity to expedite execution of this
Agreement, authorization for President Todd H. Stroger to execute said Agreement is being requested by
Poll.
In accordance with Cook County Code Section 2-108(b) Emergency polling, the vote on the poll taken on
January 23, 2009 is as follows: 16 Yeas; and 1 Nay (Commissioner Peraica).

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, the United States Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Medicare
and Medicaid Services, under the previous Administration, issued rules to restrict Medicaid payments to
public providers and to disallow Medicaid payments for Graduate Medical Education and for hospital
outpatient services (the “Proposed Medicaid Rules”), thus reducing the amount of money that will flow
through the Medicaid system to health care providers, to the Cook County Health and Hospitals System
and across the country; and
WHEREAS, the United States Congress is on record in opposition to the Proposed Medicaid Rules; and
WHEREAS, United States Senator Richard J. Durbin took a leadership role by introducing an
amendment to Public Law 110-28, the “U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans’ Health, and Iraq Accountability
Act, 2007” (the “Durbin Amendment”), with such amendment serving to place a one-year moratorium on
the Proposed Medicaid Rules; and
WHEREAS, with the active support of the Illinois Congressional Delegation, the Durbin Amendment
was included in Public Law 110-28, the “U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans’ Health, and Iraq
Accountability Act, 2007” and signed into law by President Bush; and
WHEREAS, this moratorium has been continued by the United States Congress and expires on April 1,
2009; and
WHEREAS, the United States House of Representatives has acted to extend the moratorium in H.R. 1,
“The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act,” to June 30, 2009; however, the United States Senate
currently does not intend to include an extension of the moratorium in its version of this bill; and
WHEREAS, the Proposed Medicaid Rules would reduce Medicaid payments to Cook County hospitals,
affecting not only Cook County and its most vulnerable citizens, but the entire public and private safetynet health care system in Cook County and in the State of Illinois.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners opposes the
Proposed Medicaid Rules and recognizes their potential impact on the Cook County public health system
as well as the overall health care system in the state of Illinois; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners hereby calls upon the
Illinois Congressional Delegation, in conjunction with the entire United States Congress, to continue its
opposition to the Proposed Medicaid Rules; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners urge the United States
Senate and the United States House of Representatives, in its conference on the economic recovery
legislation, to accept the House provision extending the moratorium through June 30, 2009 and calls on
the new Administration and the United States Department of Health and Human Services to dispose of
these pending regulations prior to June 30, 2009; and

ITEM #19
APPROVED
Transmitting a Communication, dated January 15, 2009 from
LISA WALIK, Director, Department of Risk Management
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to extend for one (1) year, Contract No. 04-41-875 with
Caremark, Inc., Northbrook, Illinois, for Pharmacy Benefit Management Services.
Reason:

By exercising this extension, Caremark, Inc. has agreed to implement an early pricing
improvement on March 1, 2009, as opposed to the regularly-scheduled date of December 1,
2009. By installing this pricing improvement nine months early, the County will save
approximately $2,000,000.00 from March 1, 2009 to November 30, 2009. In addition, the
County will also save an estimated $2,700,000.00 from December 1, 2009 to November 30,
2010. The purpose is to provide eligible Cook County employees and their dependents, if
applicable, with prescription drug benefits for retail and mail-order services as part of the
fringe benefits offered to employees.
The County of Cook, together with the City of Chicago, Board of Education of the City of
Chicago, City Colleges of Chicago, Chicago Transit Authority and Chicago Park District
(collectively, “Agencies”) will participate in a regularly-scheduled contract renewal
negotiation with Caremark, Inc. For the next contract term, the Chicago Public Schools will
manage the documentation and much of the work needed to effectively negotiate the new
agreement. The negotiation timeline has been delayed for one year. To avoid losing the
anticipated savings resulting from this negotiation, Cook County can take advantage of
Caremark’s offer to implement enhanced pricing while the Agencies complete the work
needed to conduct negotiations. The original effective date of this contract was June 1, 2004.
The expiration date of the current contract is November 30, 2009.

Estimated Fiscal Impact*: [*$99,700,000.00 (FY2009: $49,200,000.00; and FY2010: $50,500,000.00)].
Contract extension: December 1, 2009 through November 30, 2010.
*To be charged to the following accounts 490-176, 499-176 and 899-176 based actual utilization incurred
on a monthly basis. Fiscal impact subject to change pending the outcome of collective bargaining
agreement negotiations.

and
WHEREAS, Cook County has defined "abandoned property" as buildings and other structures that, after
having been vacant and unused for at least 24 months, are purchased for value by a purchaser in whom
the seller has no direct financial interest; and
WHEREAS, Cook County has defined an exception to this abandoned property definition shall be, if the
municipality or the Board of Commissioners, finds that special circumstances justify finding that the
property is "abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b; and
WHEREAS, in the case of abandonment of less than 24 months and purchase for value by a purchaser in
whom the seller has no direct financial interest, the County may determine that special circumstances
justify finding the property is deemed "abandoned"; and
WHEREAS, Class 6b requires a resolution by the County Board validating the property is deemed
"abandoned" for the purposes of Class 6b; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners has determined that the building was abandoned
for six months at the time of purchase and that special circumstances are present; and
WHEREAS, the re-occupancy will retain 12 full time jobs and create 10-12 new full time jobs; and
