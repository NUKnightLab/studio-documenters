PROPOSED RESOLUTION

RESOLUTION URGING LEGISLATION THAT WOULD REQUIRE CELL
PHONE PROVIDERS TO KEEP IDENTIFICATION
OF ALL CELL PHONE USERS ON FILE

WHEREAS, human traf?cking is de?ned by the United States Department of State as
?activities involved when one person obtains or holds another person in compelled service?;
and

WHEREAS, an estimated 2.5 million people, 80 percent of whom are women and girls,
worldwide are victims of this modern day form of slavery; and

WHEREAS, in the city of Chicago and suburban Cook County someone is reported
missing every 30 minutes, many of those are girls as young as twelve years old who are held
against their will and fall victim to Human Trafficking; and

WHEREAS, recent statistics have named Human Tra?icking the second largest most
pro?table criminal enterprise among members of organized crime and Violent street gangs;
and

WHEREAS, modern technology allows traffickers to operate virtually undetected by the
use of social media where many victims are forced to pose for humiliating and degrading
pictures that are then posted on the internet and available to be viewed by individuals
seeking to engage in sexual acts in exchange for money further contributing to the sexual
exploitation; and

WHEREAS, one of the most valuable resources available to traf?ckers to continue to
remain undetected while maintaining constant communication with victims of Human
Traf?cking, their associates, and potential customers is the use of cellular phones; and

WHEREAS, no contract prepaid cell phones are referred to on the street as burners or drop
phones and are impossible to track because phone carriers do not require a contact, photo
identi?cation or a minimum age; and

Commissioners urges the United States Congress and the Illinois General Assembly to pass
