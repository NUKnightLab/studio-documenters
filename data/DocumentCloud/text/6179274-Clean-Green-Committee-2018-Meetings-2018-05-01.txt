Motions
o Motion 1* (amended from last month’s meeting to account for price of 2 additional planters, 4 total): To
approve spending not to exceed $8,000 to construct and install planter box fences at Mautene Court
from line item 2.02 (landscaping). Service to be performed by Why Not Iron.
MT motions, WJ 2nds. All in favor. Motion carries.
Trees – update provided by Erik Grossnickle, Bartlett Tree Experts
o 90 trees pruned in March/April, primarily along Damen Ave. and Milwaukee Ave.
o EG delivered city-approved permits for tree pruning to SSA. Each permit lists the location of the tree
pruned and tree tag number, for reference. Bartlett will oversee inventory of all SSA trees in fall of
2018. Special attention will be paid to Ash trees affected by Emerald Ash borer. Bartlett will work to
identify dying trees and plan to replant with unaffected tree varieties to reduce cost of upkeep.
▪ MS to check on open tree pits along Milwaukee/Leavitt and provide a cost estimate for
replanting at these locations.
Plants--Christy Webber Update, delivered by Matthias Scheidler.
o MS reports that Christy Webber landscapes conducted area “spring clean up” in early April, which
included clearing tree pits of debris, pruning rose bushes planted along North Ave. and preparation for
spring plantings in SSA.
o Notable re-occurring issue: many tree pits are now too small for trees planted, which is allowing roots
to crown and be stepped on. This is affecting tree health for pits that are cut too small. SSA staff will
consider the cost to cut these tree pits wider, to benefit tree health.
Trash/Cleanslate Update – delivered by Ron Halvorsky.
o Cleanslate began “summer schedule” in April—teams are operating in WPB 6 days a week (every day
except Wednesdays).
▪ Ron reports, for the month of April: 980 graffiti tags were removed; 1,200 trash cans were
emptied; 800 stickers and signs removed; 45 jobs placed through the Cleanslate Cara program
▪ Cleanslate After Dark – Starts June 1 through end of August.
▪ Graffiti Removal—Removing as needed.
Holiday / Fest / Fun
o Holiday decorations Update— RFP updated for 2018 and will be included in April newsletter & SSA
website.
▪ One inquiry from Downtown Decorations Inc (catalog available). Quote requested.
▪ WJ suggests SSA consider installing lights on main SSA corridors in lieu of “welcome banners”
currently paid for and hung throughout SSA. HK/SC to investigate costs savings.
