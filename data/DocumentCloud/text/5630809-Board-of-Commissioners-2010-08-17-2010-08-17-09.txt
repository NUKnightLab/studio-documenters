 GENERAL BACKGROUND
To support the Plan for Transformation, Contract No. 8080 was executed between the Chicago
Housing Authority (CHA) and Piocon Technologies, Inc., to establish a Data warehouse with
associated components to serve the Authority as a repository for important data for the purpose
of analysis and reporting. Following a recent corporate reorganization, Piocon Technologies
became a subsidiary of Rolta TUSC (Rolta), and has continued to proved services under the
Rolta banner. The Information Technology Services Department (ITS) is seeking approval of
Amendment No. 02 to Contract No. 8080 to have Piocon provide additional professional
management services for Data Warehouse Phase II.
The CHA entered into contract No. 8080 with Piocon Technologies in December 2008 to
implement a Data Warehouse Business Intelligence tool for the CHA. The original timeline for
the CHARTS project was a fourteen-month (14) month engagement (seven (7) month Base
phase with a six (6) month Option base) that included two phases, Phase I Regulatory and
Resident Data Marts and Phase II Asset Management and Financial Reporting Data Marts.
On May 21, 2009 Scope Change Request #1, CHARTS Source System- CCS was created and
later approved on June 19, 2009. The purpose of Scope Change Request #1 was for the
CHARTS project team to extract data from CCS for Resident Services and Grants
Administration into the CHARTS Data Warehouse. At the time of the advertisement of RFP
#01592 and development of the original scope of this project, business data from CCS was not
considered, therefore it was not documented as a source system. The CHARTS Source SystemCCS Change Request #1 did not impact the project timeline or cost of the project because CCS
took the place of originally identified source system, CHAidoc.
Also on May 21, 2009 Scope Change Request #2, Yardi 6.0, was created and later approved on
June 11, 2009 in the amount of $23,200.00. The purpose of the Scope Change Request #2 was
for the CHARTS project to change the ETL Technical Design and documentation to
accommodate the Yardi upgrade from version 5.0 to version 6.0. At the time the Scope Change
Request was submitted and approved, the CHARTS project team had already completed the ETL
Technical Design and documentation for several Resident Services Subject Areas that were
pointing to Yardi 5.0 tables and data and needed to change the Design/ETLs to point to the
newly deployed Yardi 6.0 tables and data.
In January of 2010, upon completion of the Business Intelligence Discovery sessions, Piocon
Technologies presented CHA with a scope of work for Phase II Asset Management and Financial
Reporting Data Marts. The CHA requested that the scope of work for Phase II be revised to
include the Work Compliance Tracking system, which was created by CHA’s ITS department as
a separate system, and which was not included in the original scope of the CHARTS project.
The CHA also requested Piocon Technologies to build eleven (11) subject areas for Asset
Management instead of the three (3) subject areas proposed in the Business Intelligence
Discovery Scope document. In order for Asset Management and Resident Services to fully
utilize the Data Warehouse Business Intelligence tool for reporting, analysis, work forecasting
and as a ‘one-stop’ delivery system for key performance data with user-specific views, the
project would require the creation of eight (8) additional subject areas. During the original scope

 development of the CHARTS project, it was estimated that Phase II Asset Management and
Financial Reporting Data Marts would require less reporting needs and system
development/design. However, upon completion of the Discovery and Business Requirements
sessions this effort proved to require extensive design and development efforts.
On May 13, 2010 the CHA and Piocon Technologies created a CHARTS Phase II Scope
Resolution Summary document that included all eleven (11) subject areas as requested, resulting
in Piocon’s proposal to perform and deliver the scope of the requested services for the amount of
$162, 000.00, including the following work components:
• $90,000 to include the Work Compliance Tracking System data
• $72,000 to ensure that the data for all of the eleven (11) Asset management
subject areas are included
On May 14, 2010 Amendment No. 1 to Contract Number 8080 was executed to provide for
additional time in order to complete the proposed Phase II scope, but with no additional
compensation. Pursuant to Amendment No. 1 the services have been extended from March 11,
2010 through September 10, 2010 under the same terms and conditions as set forth in the
Contract.
The Information Technology Department is requesting approval to enter into an amendment to
Contract No. 8080 to effect and implement Scope Change Request #3, CHARTS Phase II Scope
Resolution, which will include an increased project cost of $185,200.00 and a time extension of
three months, extending time for completion of the project to December 31, 2010.
Based on the foregoing, it is recommended that the Board of Commissioners authorize the Chief
Executive Officer or his designee to execute Amendment No. 02 to Contract No. 8080 with
Piocon for additional professional management services for Data Warehouse Phase II in the
amount of $185,200.00. The new total contract amount for Contract No. 8080 will be
$2,970,926.00.
