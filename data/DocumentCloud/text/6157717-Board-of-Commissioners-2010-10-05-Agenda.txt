RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, for twenty years, Mr. William R. Quinlan has served the people of Cook County on a pro
bono basis as Chairman of the Cook County Judicial Advisory Council (JAC) and, since his appointment
in April of 1991, has served four successive administrations, those of Presidents Richard J. Phelan, John
H. Stroger, Jr., Bobbie L. Steele, and Todd H. Stroger; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Quinlan has worked tirelessly to fulfill the statutory goal of the JAC to study and devise
means to improve the administration of justice in Cook County and has brought to this mission his
considerable legal experience and knowledge garnered as Corporation Counsel for the City of Chicago
from 1974 to 1980 under Mayor Richard J. Daley, as Cook County Circuit Court Judge from 1980 to
1985, as Appellate Court Judge from 1985 to 1989, as Parliamentarian for the Cook County Board from
1992-2006, and as named partner in respected private law firms over the past two decades; and
WHEREAS, in his capacity as JAC Chairman, Mr. Quinlan was instrumental in the administration’s
efforts to obtain fair funding mechanisms for federal public safety grant programs, which resulted in over
$35 million of funding for crime prevention programs that the County could not otherwise have afforded
and that have benefited tens of thousands of Cook County youth and their families; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Quinlan established a funding procurement program that resulted in the JAC staff’s
obtaining millions of dollars of needed outside funding for improvements to the juvenile justice system,
including federal and private funding for alternatives to juvenile detention and state funding for the
Juvenile Temporary Detention Center, with reforms so significant that the Annie E. Casey Foundation
named Cook County a model site in the Juvenile Detention Alternative Initiatives movement; and

ITEM #1 cont’d
WHEREAS, Mr. Quinlan established a program by which the JAC staff’s legislative analyses have
alerted legislators of potential fiscal impacts upon Cook County of proposed penalty-enhancing state
criminal and juvenile justice legislation and have resulted in millions of dollars of cost avoidance for
Cook County through defeat or amendment of costly bills over the past several decades; and
WHEREAS, JAC Chairman Quinlan, in his capacity as unpaid Chairman of the Cook County Criminal
Justice Coordinating Council, has, since 1989, devoted his time and energy to chairing frequent meetings
of elected officials and criminal justice system decision makers, including the Cook County Sheriff, the
State’s Attorney, the Public Defender, the Chief Judge of Cook County’s Circuit Court, the Presiding
Judge of the Criminal Division of the Circuit Court of Cook County, the Clerk of the Circuit Court of
Cook County, the Superintendent of the Chicago Police Department, and other local and state leaders, and
this successful cooperative effort has helped Cook County reduce the Jail crowding that has been the
subject of two federal constitutional consent decree cases since 1982; and
WHEREAS, in order to educate and inspire judicial candidates in Illinois to conduct professional, ethical
campaigns, Mr. Quinlan, beginning in October of 2000, founded and served as Chairman of the Task
Force on Illinois Judicial Elections, a statewide coalition comprised of leaders of the Illinois Judges
Association, the Illinois State Bar Association, The Chicago Bar Association, the American Judicature
Society, and Alliance Bar Associations.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that President Todd H. Stroger and the Cook County Board
of Commissioners, on behalf of the more than five million residents of Cook County, do hereby express
profound gratitude to William R. Quinlan for his 20 years of pro bono distinguished service to the people
of Cook County, Illinois, and for his many contributions to the improvement of the Cook County justice
system.

PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT
WHEREAS, On December 9, 2009, Governor Pat Quinn signed into Law SB 1466 (PA 96-0832), which
establishes limits on contributions from individuals and corporations (10 ILCS 5/9-8.5); and
WHEREAS, currently the Ethics Ordinance does not reflect the state law that limits contributions from
individuals and corporations to Cook County elected officials, other than those from individuals and
corporations doing business with the County; and
WHEREAS, when only selective limits are in place, candidates to Cook County office have to rely on
donations made by people of higher financial status, allowing a selective few to financially control the
candidate political committees of elected officials; and
WHEREAS, by selectively restricting contributions, major influence on policy and votes will come from
a selective few privileged individuals; a dangerous path towards very specific ideologies and convictions
being thrust upon governmental officials without the best interest of the majority of Cook County
residents in mind; and
WHEREAS, individual contributions over $5,000.00 can greatly influence elected official’s decisions.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that Chapter

Swedish pop band ABBA, to wit:
I’ve been so lucky, I’m the girl with the golden hair,
I wanna sing it out to everybody, what a joy, what a life, what a chance!
So I say…
Thank you for the music, the songs I’m singing
Thanks for all the joy they’re bringing
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty
What would life be?

TRANSFER OF FUNDS
ITEM #10
APPROVED
Transmitting a Communication, dated September 28, 2010 from
MATTHEW B. DeLEON, Secretary to the Board of Commissioners
requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners to transfer funds totaling $55,200.00 from and to the
accounts listed below, for the replacement of the existing media library on the Secretary to the Board of
Commissioners website and to pay outstanding invoices for the previous vendor which provided that
service.
Reason:

Since 2007, the Office of the Secretary to the Board of Commissioners made significant
changes to its internet presence in order to provide greater transparency and a wider array of
information for residents of Cook County and County staff. One aspect of this effort was the
addition of a media library which contained audio and video recordings of Board
proceedings. In reviewing the web presence of jurisdictions similar to ours, we determined
that our current library could be improved upon substantially in terms of ease of use and
faster access to information. This transfer will allow the Office to substantially upgrade and
improve upon the existing service and to complete our obligations with the current vendor
and provide the preliminary elements for live streaming video and audio of County Board
proceedings.

TRANSFER OF FUNDS continued
ITEM #10 cont’d
June 28, 2010. On May 29, 2010, the balance in the account was $60,100.00.
2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
For all accounts used as the source of transfer funds, an effort was made throughout the year to
meet all obligations and provide all services while identifying cost effective methods of doing so.
Once the office was comfortable that all obligations would be met for this fiscal year, the office
sought to find new ways of improving on existing services by reprogramming remaining funds.
These accounts represent all accounts available to the office for purposes of transfer.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from the following:
018-225 Postage: None
018-240 Printing and Publishing: None
018-260 Professional and Managerial Services: None
018-353 Books, Periodicals, Publications, Archives and Data Services: Canceled subscriptions to
publications which were available online.
018-397 Office Expense - Secretary to the Board of Commissioners: Deferred office supply
purchases after determining that existing supplies would meet current year demand.
018-441 Maintenance and Repair of Data Processing Equipment and Software: Determined that
existing equipment was in good order and could defer any maintenance or repair beyond
the last two months of this fiscal year.
018-579 Computer Equipment: None
018-880 Institutional Memberships & Fees: Invoices for organizations to which the County
belongs were slightly less than anticipated.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.

TAKASHI REINBOLD, Director, Department of Budget and Management Services
Re:

Reductions Guidance Memorandum

submitting the letter to the bureaus and departments which provided the guidelines for development of
their Fiscal Year 2011 Budget Requests to the Department of Budget and Management Services.
LETTER
September 27, 2010
Cook County Commissioners, Elected Officials and Department Heads,
FY 2011 BUDGET DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES
As we are preparing to receive your requests of funding for FY 2011, we wanted an opportunity to
discuss issues that will have an impact on the development of your FY 2011 budget.
Amendment 10S, which was adopted during passage of the FY 2010 Budget increased the budgetary hold
back of departments to accommodate the anticipated $32 million of lost Sales Tax Revenue. The rollback
of .5%, which went into effect July 1, 2010, reduced the Sales Tax Rate from 1.75% to 1.25%. The actual
revenue effect of this rollback will first be experienced in the final two months (October and November)
of FY 2010.
The Bureau of Finance’s First Pass Plan (6/30/2010) for FY 2011 Revenues anticipated a year over year,
2010 to 2011, revenue decline in the General Fund of approximately $311 million. The revised revenue
plan for 2011 is now forecasting a decline of $317 million. Additionally, we expect previously approved
wage increases and fringe benefits to add another $35 million to the 2011 expenditures.
This revenue estimate will require process changes and new planning strategies in order to continue
current levels of service to citizens. Many of you will recall the $502 million projected deficit in 2007.
We were able to remedy that situation with increasing revenues and expenditure reductions. The
difference between then and now is that in 2007 the economy was not in the throes of a deep recession.
What makes this time more troublesome is that there is no foreseeable sign of meaningful relief. The
current revenue plan reflects continued challenging economic conditions affecting housing, employment
and consumption. Based on the estimated revenues for next year, our current level of expenditures cannot
be sustained.

POST BOARD ACTION AGENDA
Meeting of October 5, 2010

BUREAU OF FINANCE
DEPARTMENT OF BUDGET AND MANAGEMENT SERVICES continued
FY 2011 BUDGET DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES continued
ITEM #14 cont’d
We must look differently at how we develop the FY 2011 budget. Traditional approach would start with
the 2010 budget then raise or lower appropriations based on existing expectations of spending for
operations. Strategies in developing the FY 2011 budget will have to include alternative ways of using
resources. We must be cognizant of and prioritize our primary core functions. Then we must craft a more
flexible budget, one that gives us leeway to decide how best to utilize available resources. With this as a
guiding principle we establish the following budget development guidelines:
1. Budget expectation is 11 % pro rata reduction from the 2010 Adopted Budget with the exceptions
noted below.
Line items excluded from the above calculation: 260 – Professional Services, 298 –
Special Programs, 818 – Reimbursement to Designated Funds.
a. 260 – Professional Services. Our expectation is to reduce this
account by 35%. The reductions will not be pro rata. Any
Professional Services must be justified in detail. All requests will
be reviewed and approved subject to available funding.
2. Use of the Fixed Charges 490, 499 and 899 lines will no longer be available for departments. The
use of the Fixed Charges Departments is for expenditures that are not directly attributable to the
function or purpose of a specific department. By placing department specific costs in 490, 499,
or 899 a distorted view of the actual cost of providing a service or function of the department is
presented. We are reviewing all charges to these departments to determine the appropriateness of
the current funding location. We will transfer 90% of 2010 adopted appropriation to the
appropriate control department. When preparing your FY 2011 request, please identify each item
previously budgeted in 490, 499 or 899 as such.
3. Countywide contracts must be funded through each using department’s line items. This will
ensure that the contract is properly funded with required amounts. Any questions regarding the
amounts for your department should be directed to the department responsible for the countywide
contract. Underfunding will require a transfer of funds to accommodate the cost of the contracted
obligation.
Departments responsible for the initiating, monitoring and payment of countywide
contracts are to ensure that the Department of Budget and Management Services is aware
of all departments using the contract and amounts to be appropriated to each department.
4. Requests for new or increased capital funding must provide an analysis outlining the benefit of
such a request; improvement to current work processes, service level or additional revenue.

total of $689.3 million. Any type of capital project that may require ongoing funding for
operations by using future general funds must be evaluated before new or additional funding is
requested.
Please budget capital leasing options in operating accounts and not in the Capital Equipment
Funding Request of the Budget Request application.
5. Define the core purpose of your department. Describe how your department serves public
interest. Please use this template for submitting your mission statement.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
Source accounts were identified by surplus amounts and the estimated expenditures for the
remainder of the year in those accounts.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from.
There will not be any projects, purchases, programs, contracts or other obligations that will be
deferred, delayed, or cancelled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority.

4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
A decision to reduce training costs and subsequent travel costs was made after the budget was
approved to ensure sufficient funding for critical areas in the Zoning Board's budget. It is believed
that the balances remaining in: Training Programs for Staff Personnel 170-186, Books, Periodicals,
Publications, Archives and Data Services 170-353, Computer Operations Supplies 170-388 and
Printing and Publishing 170-240 will be adequate through the remaining fiscal year.

in the amount of $1,047.09 be issued.
