Chairman Johnson read the following restatement:
“We’ve received evidence that shares previously owned by Clarence Schielein
and beneficially owned by David Schielein have been surrendered to Par-A-Dice.
We’ve reviewed the documents setting forth the terms of divestiture and we’ve
satisfied ourselves that David and Clarence Schielein no longer maintain any
ownership and/or beneficial ownership interest in Par-A-Dice.
We’ve concluded that this transaction satisfies the requirements of the Board’s
order of February 8, 1996 relating to divestiture.”

the Board stand adjourned. Member Browder seconded the motion. The motion was
