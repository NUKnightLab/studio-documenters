accordance with language set forth in the Combined Plan Document.
Member- Rodney Watts
o Mr. Watts has inquired about the status of his prior request to purchase
military service time in 2005. Due to the untimely processing of Mr. Watt’s
application, Staff has recommended Mr. Watts be granted the opportunity
to purchase the military time.
Newsletter
o Crystal Perkins is the subject of the April newsletter spotlight. Future
editions of the newsletter will not be mailed but placed on the new

disbursements from the pay card in a separate disbursement report.

Re: Pay card Recommendation
