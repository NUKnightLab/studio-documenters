 Vision Zero Focus Cities Announcement

- Chicago has been named as one of ten focus cities for the national Vision Zero
Network: Austin, Boston, Chicago, Fort Lauderdale, Los Angeles, New York City,
Portland, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington DC
- Participants in the Focus Cities program will include representatives of each city’s
Mayor’s Office, Transportation Department, Police Department, and Public Health
Department. In addition, a concurrent track for collaboration will bring together
Vision Zero community advocates from each of the Focus Cities.
- The Vision Zero Network will facilitate cooperation amongst the Focus Cities,
including peer-to-peer exchange of ideas and strategies, sharing data, and regular
communication to not only advance the cities’ individual efforts but also advance
the state of the practice of traffic safety in cities across the nation.
