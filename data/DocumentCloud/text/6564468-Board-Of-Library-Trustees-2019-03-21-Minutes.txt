Mr. Corrigan submitted the following report.
Resolution to Amend Policy on Internet and Computer Use
and Policy on Patron Conduct
Mr. Corrigan moved approval of the following resolution.
Mr. Seifullah seconded the motion, which passed
unanimously by roll call vote.
WHEREAS, Library policies are revised periodically to
conform with recommendations from the Library’s
Leadership Team and changes in the law; and
WHEREAS, Current library policies that place
restrictive time limits on the use of public computers
were written when the Library offered fewer computer
resources and the patrons we served owned fewer personal
devices; and
WHEREAS, To remove barriers to learning and better
connect people with the resources they need to build
readiness for opportunity, the Leadership Team
recommends that the current two-hour-per-day time limit
on the use of public computers be lifted; now therefore
be it
RESOLVED, That the Board of Library Trustees adopt a
revised Policy on Internet and Computer Use, effective
April 1, 2019, which strikes the language “patrons are
limited to two hours of use per day on the public
computers managed by reservation software, regardless of
the number of library cards used or Cleveland Public
Library locations visited,” and be it further
RESOLVED, That the Board of Library Trustees adopt a
revised Policy on Patron Conduct, effective April 1,
2019, which strikes Section 1.20: “Exceeding the 2-hour

per day time limit on use of computers managed by
reservation software.”
Mr. Corrigan stated that this item was discussed at
length at Joint Finance, Capital & Community Services
Committee Meeting and thanked CJ Lynce, TechCentral
Manager, for his observation and leadership on this
issue.
RESOLUTION TO
OFFICER A
FOOD FOR
FINES PROGRAM
Approved

Resolution to Offer a Food for Fines Program
Mr. Corrigan moved approval of the following resolution.
Ms. Washington seconded the motion, which passed
unanimously by roll call vote.
WHEREAS, Cleveland Public Library has long supported
the Greater Cleveland Food Bank’s Harvest for Hunger
campaign, joining other organizations in northeast Ohio
to collectively raise awareness of the hunger issues
faced in our region; and
WHEREAS, The staff CPL FIT Committee recommends that
the Library once again sponsor a program for library
patrons that will offer overdue fine forgiveness in
exchange for food donations of the non- perishable food
items most in demand at local hunger centers; and
WHEREAS, Procedures to implement the program will be
developed by administrative staff; now therefore be it
RESOLVED, Cleveland Public Library will offer an overdue
fine forgiveness program called Food for Fines from
April 1-30, 2019, in support of the Greater Cleveland
Food Bank’s ongoing efforts to address hunger and food
insecurity in northeast Ohio.
Trustee Corrigan cautioned staff that this program might
cause confusion with the public. The Library has been
receiving a tremendous amount of publicity for the
recent announcement about eliminating overdue fines
starting July 27, 2019. He advised staff to work on a
communications plan that would explain how a food for
fines program would benefit patrons now, prior to the
start of going fine free.

Comparative Statement of Annual Statistics 2018
(See pages 599-605)
Mr. Corrigan noted that the total circulation is up 6%
and additional details are available relative to the
Main Library and branches. This report provides what we
have experienced last year and its predecessor as we
collected and finalized those statistics.

COMPARATIVE
STATEMENT OF
ANNUAL
STATISTICS 2018
Approved

Mr. Corrigan noted the decline in computer sessions as a
result of the change of environment for computer use,
improved skill and the increase in personal devices.
Finally, Mr. Corrigan stated that the Library performs
an important bridge in the gap where people are
underserved for broadband and other internet services.
Monthly Activity Report
(See pages 606-611)

MONTHLY
ACTIVITY
REPORT
Submitted

Mr. Corrigan stated that Main Library circulation is up
30% from last year.
Timothy Diamond, Chief Knowledge Officer, stated that it
is important to keep in mind that automatic renewals
began last year in April. Automatic renewals have
spiked the Library’s circulation. If patron do not renew
materials themselves, they will automatically renew up
to five times pending that there are no other requests
pending for that materials.
Building Status Update
Jeremiah Swetel, Chief Operating Officer, gave an update
on the façade cleaning for Main and LSW and stated that
this process will significantly enhance the stone on our
buildings. The façade cleaning should be complete by
the first week in May.
Mr. Swetel stated that design will soon be complete for
the Eastman Reading Garden project as preliminary
estimates are coming in.
The closeout process for South Branch and other Safe,
Warm & Dry Projects continue as warranties are
collected, training sessions, etc.

Advocacy Taskforce Update

The Safe, Warm and Dry Update was included in the
Building Status Update.

Ms. Washington stated that under Governor DeWine’s
administration, it is proposed that the Public Library
Fund remain at the same level with the slight increase
in last year’s budget. There is work to be done in the
legislative process to ensure that that is maintained.
With Lt. Governor John Hustead’s focus on workforce
development, libraries are seen as a central part of
that as well. Whether it is through our consultant Tim
Cosgrove or the Metro Directors’ consultant, it would
probably be good for someone to give a policy
legislative update to the Board.
Director Thomas confirmed that Mr. Cosgrove will be in
attendance at an upcoming Regular Board Meeting.
Director Thomas stated that Governor DeWine will
probably be the most “pro-library” than we have ever had
and has already confirmed that he will be the guest
speaker at OLC Legislative Day at the Statehouse, April
9, 2019.

discovered some of her manuscripts at a flea market in
Milford, New York. Intrigued by her writings, he set out
on a quest to discover more about her. His search led
him to CPL's archivist, Ann Marie Wieland, who worked
with Rachel Senese in the Cleveland Digital Public
Library to connect him with the research materials that
make up a substantial part of his book, published
earlier this year. Dr. Arango's appreciation for their

RE: Cleveland Public Library
Martin Luther King Jr. Branch
Design Reboot Fraposal

Dear Trustees,

We are honored to move torword in designing a new, state-ot-the-art branch library that will
pay tribute to the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. We admire the ambition to make the
MLK Branch an integral part of the ongoing mixed-use project at the confluence of tour distinct
neighborhoods in Cleveland. We are excited at the at setting the tone for the larger
development proiect that will exist at the Forefront at the changing community.

We are enthused oboutyour vision for building upon the prestige of this neighborhood, enriching
the architecturally varied and distinctive character at University Circle. We look Forward to
creating a space that not only honors Dr. King?s legacy but also increases public usage by
serving as a center at a diverse and inclusive community.

We recognize that the Library Trustees seeks to ensure the connectivity of this library with the
new developments and existing neighborhood. We believe that 50 IL JKURTZ is poised to
strengthen this narrative, taking design risks to bring the library to a broader audience. We will
work to develop a holistic narrative that takes these diverse stakeholder and public identities into
account while also designing a space that will adapt and thrive overtime.

We are excited be a part of making the library a reality.

Sincerely,

Proiect Description: Overall

The proiect is for a library located on three parcels located on the north side of Euclid
Avenue in University Circle, Cleveland, Ohio.

The new library will be ground and second level and will consist of approximately
35,000 SF. This proiect will include a 9-storey residential development above
the library by Midwest development Partners, with which we will coordinate the
design of the library to maintain design intent. The program and other requirements
are detailed in full in the Competition submission and subsequent Proiect Reboot
submission, attached as an appendix to this document.

This proposal includes basic Architectural and Engineering services associated with
the MLK Library as well as coordination with the architect of the residential tower.
This prOposal assumes that there will be shared spaces and/or building components
which will require coordinationiwith the tower as well as components of the tower
which will require cursory review and have some bearing on the Library.

included below are a series of assumptions that this proposal has relied on which
have originated out of initial discussions with the Library and their pre-construction
services advisor.

Architectural- We will provide architectural design services on components relating
to the first two stories of the overall building structure with the exclusion of those
items belonging solely to the residential tOWer development. These exclusions
include residential elevators and residential lobbies. We have assumed the design
of the facade including coordination and detailing of those components which wrap
the residential portions of the ground level of the building, these will require close
coordination with the tower architects which we have allotted for.

Furniture Fixtures and Equipment - This proposal includes interior design and FFE for
which we will coordinate with designated library personnel to identify and provide
direction. It assumes a furnishing supplier is engaged to specify and purchase
furnishings and equipment to meet the libraries needs design and material selection
from the architects.

Civil - MDP to provide all civil to within 5' of building along with related approvals.
We will review, coordinate, and verify Civil accommodations are adequate for
any Library needs through providing building related infrastructure loads and
requirements. See GPD in appendix 8 for clarification.

Landscape- We have included landscape services from surrounding curbs to the
building. We exclude alley way, service drive, crosswalks, and items outside of this
purview. We have not included Landscape services for the plaza to the east nor any
accommodation for on-structure landscape components. See GPD in appendix for
clarification.

Structural - It is currently conceived that MDP will provide all superstructure and
foundation design, including design of the Library 2nd floor assuming this is all
part of the concrete plinth. We will provide all sub-structure for the Library, ground
level facade and related structural requirements that might impact loading of the
superstructure [canopy, curtain wall, railings, ceilings, stairs, etc.] See GPD in
appendix for clarification.

Des/kw Pro para} .170486

Project Description: Overall

MEP - Main service for all utilities to and from building will be provided by MDP.
We will provide loading requirements for the Library. Roof drains and roof will be
by MDP but coordinated through our space and within library performance criteria
cast iron to reduce noise vs. PVC etc.]. We will provide drainage as related to
canopy and or coordinate that loading with roof drainage approach. It is assumed
that services will be brought into a central room shared electrical room] and
then the panel and library service will be us. See GPD in appendix for clarification.

Lighting and Technology Design - this proposal includes lighting, AV, Technology,
and Security for the Library as well as ground level facade, entry, and associated
landscape lighting. See Tec Studio in Appendix for clarifications.

Signage/ldentity/Wayfinding and Anisfield Wolf collection exhibits - We have
provided both general building signage and graphics and design of the Anisfield
Wolf exhibits within this proposal. It does not include the fabrication of such signage
and exhibits. See in Appendix for Clarifications.

Interactive exhibits - We have included a line item for both conceptual study
of interactive exhibits as identified in our competition proposal as well as
exploration of the technology associated with such exhibits [Tec Inc]. Because these
exhibits could vary greatly in both scope and complexity, we have not allocated
services for the design and execution of any one of them but propose that once
defined, values and the team required to execute will be assembled. We will also
assist CPL in identifying and allocating a budget for such exhibits. See and Tec
Studio proposals in appendix for clarifications.

Acoustics - As the accepted design for the MLK Library includes a large degree
of open areas and architectural volume, we have included acoustic design and
Oversight by Specialists in the industry within this proposal. See Threshold Acoustics
in appendix for clarifications.

Permits, testing, and inspections are assumed to be by the Construction Manager
with the assistance of the architectural team in providing required documentation.
Planning and design approval by the City of Cleveland and other AHJ [Midtown
Design Review] will be by design team, coordinated with overall tower approvals.

We have included fees for architecture and engineering outlines, narratives and

documentation for a conceptual stand-alone building for use by estimators in
evaluating costs related to coordinated bookkeeping.

Project Description: SD Plus

This proposal for Schematic Design Services is an abbreviation of the full design
services and will include work from all disciplines required to progress the entire
proiect. We expect full deployment of all disciplines in this phase. We will study
and investigate program relationships, structure, materiality, constructability with teh
CMR, and primary building systems in relation to the design brief.

Schematic Design Complete: June 14th, 2019

Note that during SD some disciplines and Work related to later phases may be
incurred in order to progress those components outlined below for coordination
purposes. While we will be billing only under the SD approved amount indicated
here-in, we do not forfeit the right to bill for those services conducted early, in the
due course of later phases.

A special emphasis will be placed on those items identified below as they will require
early coordination packages with the tower development timeline. We have included
dates for finalizing and conveying information to the MDP engineers nextto the item.

Provide direction on or about April 15, 2019

Finalize definition of column grid with special consideration of framing for longer
span areas of second floor

Confirm floor-to floor heights given MDP's Structural studies for concrete vs.
steel systems

- Define approach to second level structural: concrete vs. steel, work with Panzica
to discuss pro?s and con?s of each approach

Submit to MDP Structural engineers on June 14, 2019

Second Level profile and definition sufficient for MDP Structural [Thorson Baker]
to begin Structural [due 09.02.2019]

Slab edge and railing requirements embedds, stair connection locations;
sufficient for loading and detailing - final locations can follow after this date

structural loading and general location of substantial equipment, Specific
detailing can follow after this date

Curtainwall and canopy approach sufficient to provide loading, connection
types, and configuration as required by MDP structural Engineer

RE: Cleveland Public Library MLK Branch

Dear Jon:

We are thrilled to be part of this great team you have assembled and won for the CPL MLK
design competition. The project will be both challenging and culturally momentous to our
region. Following the concept design phase, we look forward to continue working closely
with you and Jing to achieve your vision for this Cleveland landmark.

Project Description

Our team was honored to participate with you in the design competition last year for the
construction of this new state?of?the?art branch library that will honor the legacy of Dr.
Martin Luther King, Jr. Located along the western boundary of the University Circle
neighborhood. The new MLK Branch will become an integral part of a large, residential and
commercial mixed?use project at the confluence of four distinct neighborhoods and
districts: the Hough and Fairfax neighborhoods, the University Circle educational and
cultural district, and the vast Cleveland Clinic hospital campus. This offers CPL a unique
opportunity to create a library design that sets the tone for the larger development project
that will serve as a gateway amongst these distinct neighborhoods.

The project site consists of three parcels located on the north side of Euclid Avenue
between E. 105th Street and Stokes Boulevard, Cleveland, Ohio 44106. The concept
design phase help clarify some items regarding the design and scope of the project. The
proposal uses this concept design as a basis of design. CPL intends to hire a construction
manager at risk to procure the construction activities for this new library.

The concept design phase is being implemented to integrate the needs and requirements of
the developer into the design presented with the competition phase.

GPD anticipates the construction costs will not exceed 

Scope of Services

RE: Cleveland Public Library MLK Branch Phantom Engineering

DearJon:

Thank you for your continued support on this project. As requested in your meetings with
Cleveland Public Library (CPL), we are providing you with a proposal to provide ?phantom
engineering? to determine a baseline for the library if it were to be a stand alone building.

Project Description

In negotiations with the developer on the project, CPL has identified that a baseline library
model may be beneficiai to determine any cost increases to the project to allow for a
tenant?landlord building configuration. This proposal provides JKurtz and CPL with
additional design narratives with the schematic design submittal that identifies 
configurations for the building in a standalone configuration and not associated with a
developer tower. GPD has not included any hard calculations/engineering and the proposal
will include assumption?based designs. It is assumed one (1) round of
review/comments/corrections is included with the proposal.

Fee Proposal

GPD proposes to complete the above Scope of Services for the following lump sum fees

We are excited about working with JKURTZ, SO-IL, and Cleveland Public Library (CPL) team on the
redesign of the CPL Martin Luther King Jr. Branch, and making it possible for everyone to have "A Place
at the Table." Thank you again for inviting us to be a part of this significant and vital addition to
Cleveland's vibrant cultural and literary community, and working together to create an iconic living tribute
to Dr. King and the Anisfield-Wolf Book Awards.
As we heard in the many meetings leading up the design competition, we are looking forward to helping
make this library branch a local, regional, and even national destination that elevates the library
experience, and makes visitors rethink what a library is, and can be.
Per our discussion we are dividing our Proposal into 3 sections: Essential Services which are absolutely

needed for a successful opening of the new Library; Optional Services, which while not essential, can

complement our Essential Services; and Enhanced Services which would bring the project to the level of
aspiration the competition included. We are combining most of these services into three Design Packages,
which will include all creative fees associated with the Essential Services, as well as preliminary explorations
and recommendations of the interactive exhibits listed in the Enhanced Services.
ENGAGMENT OVERVIEW
Nesnadny + Schwartz (N+S) is pleased to submit the following specifications and budget in response to an
invitation from JKURTZ I SO-IL to design Identity, Way-finding, and Exhibition Design for the Cleveland

Public Library Martin Luther King Jr. Branch (MLK Library). The specific items addressed in this agreement

are itemized below. In addition to these unique undertakings, it is understood that N+S will also serve as the
MLK Library's visual design consultant and advise on all projects and matters relating to how the library is
visually represented to internal and external audiences. Projects over and above those described here can
be addressed as they arise as separate budgets, or N+S can work with CPL on a retainer until the library is
complete, and all design matters have been resolved. Our budget is based on the parameters discussed
during all calls, meetings, and our review and familiarity of current designs and plans of the new library.
SCOPE OF PROJECT: ESSENTIAL SERVICES
lden ity Design: This project consists of creating an identity theme for the new MLK Library, which may
consist of unique typographical treatments, iconography, patterns, and color which will serve to brand the
look and feel of the library and work harmoniously with the architecture to help elevate the overall visitor
experience. Just as the architecture will serve as a model for the future of CPL, so should the entire visual
scheme. This visual voice will than help guide the design of the Way-finding and Signage System.
Approach: The creative process will include extensive typographical, graphical, and color palette
research, and thorough design studies to ensure the new identity works seamlessly within the context of
the surrounding architecture, and pays respectful homage to the Dr. King legacy.
Way-finding and Signage Design: Part of a successful MLK Library experience necessitates the design of
clear and easy-to-understand way-finding and signage to help visitors navigate through the library
environment. While operationally imperative, well-designed way-finding also serves to enhance the visual
appeal of the facility, and complement the architecture. N+S will apply the new MLK Library identity to a
family of signs outside and inside the new library. This collection of signs may include: main exterior street­
facing branding signage; secondary exterior branding signage along the rear and sides of the library; exterior

way-finding and informational signage; main interior branding signage; and all interior way-finding and
informational signage.
Approach: The creative process will include extensive typographical, graphical, color palette, materials,
fabrication, and installation research in order to develop a comprehensive way-finding signage system
with standardized type styles, composition, and layout formats that may be applied to a variety of signage
types and applications.
Signage types to be explored include library area identifiers (e.g. Shelter, Playground, Think Room,
Action Area, Reading Garden, Information, etc.), book stack and subject area identifiers (e.g. Fiction,
Nonfiction, Children, etc.}, desk labels, meeting room and office identifiers, and floor plan maps.
Signage applications to be explored include wall graphics, floor graphics, banners, free standing signage,
window graphics, illuminated signage, and interactive touch screens.
Amsfield-Wolf Book Awards Exhibition Design: As the Anisfield-Wolf Book Award (AWBA) design firm
of record, N+S is keenly familiar with the history and importance of this venerable institution and makes
us uniquely qualified to be involved with creating the award-winning books' new home in the MLK Library.
N+S will work closely with JKURTZ, SO-IL, AWBA, and CPL in conceptualizing and designing the AWBA
exhibit installation, and making the "Mountaintop," and "Forest of Hopes and Dreams" a reality.
Approach: The creative process will include extensive typographical, graphical, color palette, materials,
fabrication, and installation research in order to develop a unique, impactful, and memorable installation
that successfully honors the AWBA winners, gives visitors a fulfilling understanding of the Award's
importance, provides thorough access to all AWBA winning books, represents the iconic m irrored forest
originally envisioned, and adheres to the AWBA brand that has already been established.
SCOPE OF PROJECT: OPTIONAL SERVICES
Busmess Papers, Collateral, and Marketmg Mater ials : As one of the premier branches in the CPL
system, the MLK Library can greatly benefit from a unique family of complelling communication materials
to help promote the location as a important and exciting destination. N+S will apply the new MLK library
identity to an assortment of Business Papers and Collateral Materials specified by the MLK Library staff.
As those pieces have yet to be identified, N+S is budgeting time for the design of 12-18 unique items.
Approach: The creative process will include extensive typographical, graphical, color palette, materials,
and production research in order to develop a comprehensive communications package with standardized
type styles, composition, and layout formats.
Items that may be explored include business cards, letterhead, envelopes, note cards, pocket folder,
bookmark, t-shirt, hat, etc.
Identity Guidelines: N+S will design a straightforward (up to 12 pages}, Brand Identity Guideline

document that outlines usage rules for the new MLK library identity. Some of the items to be addressed
include

proper

and

improper

identity

usage,

size

and

placement

requirements,

typographical

specifications, color palette description and color usage, and extended complementary color palette.
Approach: The creative process will include extensive typographical, graphical, color palette, materials,
and production research in order to develop a cohesive and comprehensive set of guidelines that clearly
outlines proper use and application of the new MLK Library identity, allowing for consistent visual
branding by all internal and outside sources.

MLK Library: Identity, Way-finding, and Exhibit Design
Page 3
SCOPE OF PROJECT: ENHANCED SERVICES
In addition to the MLK Library Identity and Way-finding Signage, which will reference Martin Luther
King Jr.'s legacy, there are other featured projects exhibits we are proposing that can solidly embed
his presence into the MLK Library experience. It is important to note that any of one of these exhibits
is

a

prime sponsorship opportunity

for

local,

regional,

or

even national

organizations

and

corporations. N+S can work with CPL in helping to broker these opportunities, as many of our clients
are po tential funders , e.g. the Cleveland Foundation and the George Gund Foundation.
MLK Library Webs it e: N+S is proposing the design of an innovative, forward-looking, responsive
(viewable on all devices) website that would not only serve as an online tool for accessing the collections,
resources, and services currently offered online, but also be an extension of the interactive exhibits in
place at the branch. For example, recordings made in the Dream Room can be accessible on the MLK
Library Website, and conversely recordings made offsite can be uploaded to the library exhibit. Or, a
m iniature version of the Freedom Map which pinpoints key Cleveland historical locations can be
accessed through the website. The potential is limitless. With a compelling user interface, intuitive
navigation, contemporary design, and engaging content, the website will serve as a dynamic extension of
the M LK Library, and further reinforce its role as a library of the future.
Approach: N+S will work closely with CPL in determining the website's content and site map, desired
features and services, needs for a custom content management system (CMS), visual design, and overall
user experience.
Drean Room: On the "Mountaintop" there will be a unique space where visitors can record what they
envision our comm unity, our city, our country, and our world can be. They will also be able to listen to

archived wishes from previous visitors using a variety of search parameters.
Approach: N+S will work closely with JKURTZ, SO-IL, the team's technical partner, CPL. and potential
project sponsor, in designing the appearance of the space as it relates to the surrounding AWBA
installation, and overall library ambiance. N+S will explore title and instructional signage for the area that
follows the MLK Library system described above, along with additional graphical applications to energize
the space. If a sponsor is funding the exhibit, N+S will work with them in designing a personal identifier for
the space that is a unique piece of signage, but also follows the newly established MLK Library brand.
Word Walk: N+S will design a unique walkway along the perimeter of "The Table" where visitors can
walk or roll over a strip of floor that is occupied by thousands of glowing words. As people move the
words interact with their feet or wheels. They can s i mply enjoy the playful movement they create or spend
more time building sentences or phrases.
Approach: N+S will work closely with JKURTZ, SO-IL, the team's technical partner, CPL. and potential
project sponsor, in designing the appearance of the space and projected typographical styles as they
relate to the surrounding library and Table look and feel. If a sponsor is funding the exhibit, N+S will work
with them in designing a personal identifier for the space that is a unique piece of signage, but also
follows the newly established MLK Library brand.
Freedom Map: This project consists of creating an interactive map exhibit focusing on Greater Cleveland
and highlighting important locations where significant civil rights milestones and events occurred, from Dr.
King's speech at Olivet Institutional Baptist Church to Karamu House, the oldest African American theater
in the United States. Viewers can touch featured points on the map and pop-up windows will expand to
give further information and visuals relating to the historical event or location. Where appropriate sound or
video may be included. A free app that complements the exhibit can be downloaded at the station and
guide users throughout the city where they can visit the actual locations.
Approach: N+S will work closely with JKURTZ, SO-IL, the team's technical partner, archivist, historian,
CPL, and potential project sponsor, in designing the appearance of the map and accompanying graphics
including map design and interactive functionality, sound research and design, video research and
design, photo research and design, and all expandable written content and design. N+S will explore title
and instructional signage for the area that follows the MLK Library system described above, along with
additional graphical applications to energize the space. If a sponsor is funding the exhibit, N+S will work
with them in designing a personal identifier for the space that is a unique piece of signage, but also
follows the newly established MLK Library brand.

Living Wall: N+S will create an interactive wall that may be programmed with words from Dr. King's
writings and speeches. Words like "character," "faith," "hope," and "love." Viewers can touch one of
the words and the entire quotation appears, with the date and location of when and where the words
were spoken. They can touch another portion of the wall and use more words to create their own verses
and poems.
Approach: N+S will work closely with JKURTZ, SO-IL, the team's technical partner, archivist, historian,
CPL. and potential project sponsor, in designing the appearance of the wall and projected typographical
styles as they relate to the surrounding library and Table look and feel, along with additional graphical
applications to energize the space. If a sponsor is funding the exhibit, N+S will work with them in
designing a personal identifier for the space that is a unique piece of signage, but also follows the newly
established MLK Library brand.
Virtual Garden: Reinforcing the notion of a library being the source of personal and communal growth,
N+S will design an interactive garden that will change with the seasons, and visitors you can interact with
it by planting virtual seeds and virtually watering them. They may then return at a later date, "walk
through" the garden using a virtual map, locate their plants, and see how they've grown and bloomed.
Approach: N+S will work closely with JKURTZ, SO-IL, the team's technical partner, CPL. and potential
project sponsor, in designing the appearance of the garden, along with additional graphical applications to
energize the space. If a sponsor is funding the exhibit, N+S will work with them in designing a personal
identifier for the space that is a unique piece of signage, but also follows the newly established MLK
Library brand.
Community Portrait: Supporting the idea that the MLK Library and its thematic Table can conceptually
and literally bring people together, this project consists of creating a large back-lit monitor displaying a
grid of portraits. These will be photos of library visitors - people of all ages, races, from all different walks
of life from all over the world. Integrated within the installation will be a camera new visitors can stand in
front of and let them selves be photographed. Their i m age then becomes part of the Comm unity Portrait
for others to see.
Approach: N+S will work closely with JKURTZ, SO-IL, the team's technical partner, CPL. and potential
project sponsor, in designing the appearance of the exhibit, along with additional graphical applications to
energize the space. If a sponsor is funding the exhibit, N+S will work with them in designing a personal
identifier for the space that is a unique piece of signage, but also follows the newly established MLK
Library brand.
1 alking Books: One of the charges to our team is the challenge of making parts of the library accessible

24 hours a day, 7 days a week. N+S envisions the design of a virtual library on the fa9ade of the MLK
Library in the form of a projected case of books that visitors can touch, and passages of the books will be

read to them.
Approach: N+S will work closely with JKURTZ, SO-IL, the team's technical partner, CPL. and potential
project sponsor, in designing the appearance of the exhibit, along with additional graphical applications to
energize the surrounding area, including book spine design and interactive functionality, and sound
research and design. If a sponsor is funding the exhibit, N+S will work with them in designing a personal
identifier for the space that is a unique piece of signage, but also follows the newly established MLK
Library brand.

Continuing to meet the challenge of making the MLK Library a unique destination 24

hours a day, 7 days a week, N+S would create a projected word experience as visitors walk beneath the

buildings cantilevered canopy that projects over the front sidewalk. As visitors look up they see the words

of Martin Luther King Jr. in large glowing excerpts from his many famous speeches and quotations. Using
projected sound, visitors actually hear Dr. King reciting the words as they travel down the street.
Approach: N+S will work closely with JKURTZ, SO-IL, the team's technical partner, archivist, historian,
CPL,

and potential

project sponsor,

in designing the appearance

of

the canopy and projected

typographical styles as they relate to the surrounding library and Table look and feel, along with additional
graphical applications to energize the space. If a sponsor is funding the exhibit, N+S will work with them
in designing a personal identifier for the area that is a unique piece of signage, but also follows the newly
established MLK Library brand.
Freedom Stride: One more compelling way the library can be accessible 24/7 is by designing an

interactive exhibit on the fa9ade of the library where as visitors walk along the front of the building toward
the entrance, they notice an image of Dr. King walking beside them. Using video tracking and archival
video, the experience would emulate the experience of marching with Dr. King on one of his many
historical peaceful protests.

Approach: N+S will work closely with JKURTZ, SO-IL, the team's technical partner, archivist, historian,
CPL, and potential project sponsor, in designing the appearance of the projected walk, along with
additional graphical applications to energize the space. If a sponsor is funding the exhibit, N+S will work
with them in designing a personal identifier for the area that is a unique piece of signage, but also follows
the newly established MLK Library brand.

FOUR STEP DESIGN AND D EVELOPMENT PROCESS
Our development methodology for these projects will follow a four Phase process including:
1 Discovery + Strategy

2 Concept + Destgr

3 Typesetting + Electromc Production

4 Production Management

These Phases will be followed during this collaborative engagement to provide a system for informed dia­
logue, clear feedback, and well-defined scheduling milestones and budgetary parameters. It is through
this efficient process for creative and production development that we can ensure the ultimate success of
these projects. It is understood that N+S will provide professional and creative services for these projects
and work closely with the MLK Library team to establish, review, and implement the direction and design
for these undertakings. This includes time for research, meetings, presentations, conceptual development,
original design concepts, graphic design, typesetting, and production of all digital files as required.

1. Discovery + Strategy :

We pride ourselves on "doing our homework." Great design is responsive to the

needs of our clients, and our clients' end-users. The first step in this process will be to establish and confirm
the overall strategy and objectives for all components of these projects. Central to this process will be an
evaluation of previous project versions (if relevant). This Phase would also include a review of any relevant
additional content and visual assets and discussions with CPL and MLK staff regarding the constraints and
goals of the efforts.

Regular communication between N+S and the MLK Library team will continue

throughout the discovery, creative, and production processes.
2 Concept+ Design: Once we have completed Phase 1, Discovery + Strategy, N+S will proceed with

the Concept + Design step. As these projects are multi-faceted, incremental, and subject to coinciding
with building design and construction deadlines, each project must be completed in a defined order for
the entire effort to progress efficiently and effectively. We see these efforts being completed in the
following order: Identity Design; Way-finding Design; Anisfield-Wolf Book Awards Exhibition Design; all
Enhanced Services Exhibits; followed by Business Papers, Collateral, and Marketing Materials and Brand
Identity Guidelines.

Identity Design: N+S will create and present up to 2 identity themes with up to 2 sets of refinements.

Once a final design direction has been approved, N+S will advance to exploring how the identity theme
can work throughout the library exterior and interior environments.
Way-finding and Signage Design: Once a final identity theme has been approved, N+S will begin
exploring way-finding and signage design. Once initial research has been completed for specific signage
needs and applications, and the types of signs and content of each has been approved by the MLK
Library team, N+S will begin designing a select family of up to 6 sign compositions that represent the
types of signage that will appear throughout the Library, including individual composition, material,
structure, and location. Design approaches shall be presented in digital environments emulating each
sign's size, structure, and placement. N+S will present up to 2 design themes with up to 2 rounds of

design refinements. Once a theme direction has been approved N+S will apply the look and feel to the
remaining sign types.
Anisfield-Wolf Book Awards Exhibition Design: N+S will work in tandem with JKURTZ, SO-IL, AWBA,
and CPL to design the overall look, structure, and interactive elements of the AWBA exhibit, ensuring that
the finished appearance adheres to the established AWBA brand, while having its own unique and
inspired visual voice. N+S, JKURTZ, and SO-IL will work together to coordinate schedule, presentations,
and refinements. We are budgeted to create up to 2 design directions, with up to 2 rounds of revisions.
Enhanced Services Exhibits: Depending on the selected exhibits, N+S will work closely with JKURTZ,
SO-IL, technical partners, archivists, historians, CPL, all fabricators, builders, and any potential project
sponsors, on the design and production of these exciting opportunities. In each case N+S will present 1

design approach with up to 2 rounds of design refinements.

Business Papers, Collateral, and Marketing Materials:

N+S will design between 12-18 unique

business papers or collateral and marketing materials, which may include business cards, letterhead,

envelopes, note cards, pocket folder, bookmark, t-shirt, hat etc. After CPL and N+S have agreed on this
assortment of items, N+S will begin the design process which will include extensive typographical,
graphical, color palette, materials, and production

research in order to develop a comprehensive

communications package with standardized type styles, composition, and layout formats. N+S will
present 2-3 designs for each item in the form of high-resolution color presentation pages, with 2-3 sets of

design refinements. Once each design has been approved, N+S will proceed to the Typesetting +
Electronic Production phase to create print-ready files of each item.
Identity Guidelines: Once all preliminary projects have been designed and approved, and all design
applications and rules have been addressed, N+S can proceed with developing a clear and accessible
set of Brand Identity Guidelines. This document will be up to 12 pages long in PDF form, and address

proper and improper logo usage, minimal size requirements, typographical specifications, color palette
description and color usage, and extended complementary color palette.
3. Tyresetting + Elect o tc Production

N+S will provide all required and relevant Typesetting and

related Electronic Production services. This includes all time for the initial setting of all type, up to 3
rounds of type changes, and preparation of all "printer-ready" files, as required.

4. Production Managem nt Preliminary cost estimates for Production Management and/or the time that
may be required to manage or supervise these services, are included in this Proposal. In addition to
playing an active role in the proof review process, we assume that N+S will play an active role in the
supervision of all printing, binding, fabrication, and installation of all projects including scheduling and all
vendor communication, and RFQ requests as needed. We are not including a printing, fabrication, and
installation costs at this time until final designs, material specifications, and installation parameters have
been determined.

RE:

Acoustics Consulting Proposal
Cleveland Public Library, Martin Luther King Jr. Branch

Dear Jonathan:
We are excited to have the opportunity to collaborate again, especially on a building of such civic importance. The core principals
driving the project of

vsi ual connections; differentiate,

whtle part of the

whole; and shared, not separated all speak to an

importance of carefully balancing the interior acoustic environment of each program area so that it supports the nature of the
activity inside, giving it identity, and allowing the activity to spill into the adjacent areas to speak to the connections and express
a level of vibrancy, all without allowing for disruption of one area by another.
The variety of spaces demand a level of intentional acoustic differentiation. The teen and children's spaces clearly need to allow
for a level of boisterousness that may or may not be appropriate to the mood of the temporary exhibit which may call for a

degree of variability in privacy, acoustic control, and ambiance depending on its nature. The expression of the volumes using
stairs and curtain wall shaping may itself allow for developing a level of functional independence acoustically, even while the
sightlines among these spaces may remain uninterrupted.
The opening through the mezzanine over the performance space offers an exciting opportunity to draw attention to activity in the
central zone when desired and may require special attention to keep daily activity from unintentionally disrupting the quieter
activity on the mezzanine. We look forward to exploring the options for aligning the acoustic behavior with the program goals for
the facility in its entirety.
In order to efficiently provide the input required, we are proposing more intensive involvement early in the project with lighter
overview input later in design, remaining on call for questions when design direction pulls you away from principles established
in the early phases. We have made the following adjustments to our typical scope of services to provide our services in a cost­
effective manner:
•

We will depend on the design team to alert us to issues requiring our attention after our mid-Design Development (DO)
review. In our typical approach, we provide detailed document reviews throughout the project.

•

Extensive model testing or auralization services utilized to confirm or compare alternative design approaches with an
understanding of the acoustic impact have been excluded. These tools can be made available as additional services if
design directions appear especially challenging acoustically, or if concerns are raised by the library representatives that
require a more experiential level of interaction to arrive at a level of confidence in the design.

•

One meeting per phase is included in design, with no more than three trips in Construction Administration

I

Commissioning.

A construction kick-off. typically provided at the start of critical acoustically-related trades (MEP. drywall. etc.) to
anticipate questions that frequently come into play, is not included. and may not be necessary.

An outline of our approach is offered on the following pages.

Scope of Services
Schematic Design -- Less than 3-month duration
•

Visit the existing MLK branch or other sites selected by the library that illustrate spaces that work well or that perform
badly to gain a level of first-hand experience regarding the acoustic goals for the new spaces within the reboot project.

•

Visit the site for the project to assess the nature of the environmental noise present to inform design of the building
fa�ade. Take measurements of typical outdoor noise at the site.

•

Participate in a design session with members of the design team. potentially including the architects. Mechanical.
Electrical and Plumbing (MEP) engineers. structural engineers. and curtain wall consultants (if any), all at the architects'
discretion.

•

Establish volumetric and adjacency requirements consistent with acoustic objectives and provide conceptual
recommendations regarding isolation strategies in key programmatic areas

•

Develop an acoustic design report including narrative description of the acoustic criteria. and provide drawing markups
indicating desired performance of sound isolating construction. background noise requirements. and preliminary
selection of interior treatment performance requirements for walls. floors. and ceilings.

•

Coordinate acoustic treatments and sound isolation approaches with the AudioNideo systems design provided by
others.

•

One multi-day trip to Cleveland is anticipated in this phase.

Design Development -- Three months or less n
i duration
•

Review a single progress set of documents and/or building model to verify consistency with the Schematic Design
recommendations for room acoustic. sound isolation. and noise control performance.

•

Attend one meeting during this phase to advance any portion of the work that remains with coordination of acoustic
design outstanding.

•

Provide preliminary specification language (either partial or complete sections as required) for acoustic-specific
products and construction techniques.

Construction Documents -- four months or less n
i duration
•
