PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT
ZERO-BASED BUDGETING
WHEREAS, fiscal responsibility, innovative leadership, transparency and accountability, and improved services
have been and continue to be the underlying mission of the current President and the Cook County Board of
Commissioners; and
WHEREAS, in the effort to succeed in said mission, the Performance Management Initiative was launched in
February of 2011, when the Cook County Board of Commissioners unanimously passed the performance base
management and budgeting ordinance, requiring performance management metrics be instilled within the County
budget process of all County elected officials, agencies, bureaus and departments; and
WHEREAS, the County faces serious financial and policy challenges in the coming year and years to come such
as stabilizing the pension fund, reforming the criminal justice system, and managing healthcare services to name
a few; and
WHEREAS, the County must continually look to ameliorate the budget process in order to deliver public
services in the most efficient manner; and
WHEREAS, focusing on outcome of services for dollars invested is crucial, this government should also look at
cost structure related to those service outputs and determine if we are expending appropriately and efficiently as
well as justifying expenses from year to year and over several years; and
WHEREAS, adding to the successful steps already taken by this Administration and Board of Commissioners,
the implementation of a formal Zero-Based Budgeting Program (ZBB) for all County elected officials, agencies,
bureaus and departments, an inherent tool of Performance Management and Budgeting, would serve to enhance
the aforementioned efforts; and
WHEREAS, zero-based budgeting helps to shed light on imperfections in performance-based budgeting
methodology, which can obscure specific programs and make it difficult for the public and legislators to identify
unnecessary or low priority programs being funded; and
WHEREAS, due to the time-consuming nature of said process, the ZBB program may be implemented as a
periodic, revolving review of County agencies’ operations and budgets;
Page 88 of 104

 NOW THEREFORE BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that Chapter 2

management and budgeting. The Budget Resource Allocation Plan shall clearly indicate which services are
statutorily mandated and to what extent services are required. If the Budget Resource Allocation Plan requests
funding for services or programs not mandated by law, justification shall be presented to show how such services
or programs enhance County services.
(d) In any given year the President's budget resource allocation plan shall include zero-based budgeting (a budget
based upon a justification of estimates of expenditures and requests for appropriations from a zero base) for the
County agencies, departments and programs as identified by the President and the Department of Budget and
Management Services with an objective of 10% of said agencies, departments and programs per year starting with
the FY2016 budget. Each agency shall be required to use zero-base budgeting at least once every six years and
shall not be required to use zero-based budgeting more often than once every four years. The President and the

serve as the entity designated for coordinating the preparation of zero-base budgets by the executive branch.

 alternatives and program size indicators; and
(2) A priority listing encompassing all alternative funding levels for all programs with a minimum of three
provided that at least two of these alternative funding levels shall be below the funding level for the current fiscal
year, and shall require that the baseline budget of each department or agency is assumed to be zero and each
proposed expenditure shall be justified as if it were a new expenditure.
(f) In the years in which an agency, department or program submits a zero-based budget, the President shall
include in the budget resource allocation plan all relevant materials related to each budget unit's submission
under subsection (e) of this Code and such other relevant material as deemed appropriate by the President.
(dg) The President shall present the proposed Budget Resource Allocation Plan of each County Department and
Agency to the Board for review.
(eh) The President or his or her designee, the Chief Financial Officer and the Chief Administrative Officer shall
