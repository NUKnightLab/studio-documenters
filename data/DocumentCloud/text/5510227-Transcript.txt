This is unjust and

You won't protect us from

Your power is a political gift to you from the

Mayor.

Like your decision to let officers on the

force.

It is a gift of the FOP.

16

We demand the power you have, because

17

this accountability system is a failure in the city.

18

We are the rightful owners that you have, and we live

19

in a democracy and this Board is undemocratic, and we,

Klan goddam meeting up here, but taking goddam action

11

and realizing there is still 100 victims still inside

of the goddam prison and it could be your relatives.

13

You serve as a federal prosecutor in

14

several other positions.

I know who you are.

15

who you are too, Sister.

The bottom line of it is cut

MR. PERRYMAN:

I'm here to talk about the

problems.

The police are coming
We also

10

talked to the 12th District and they said you live in

11

the is 11th District so you should talk to the Desk

12

Sergeant.

13

I guess my question for you is this.

I

I

14

have a couple -- what is the policy between the 11th

15

and 12th working together?

16

Madison being the dividing line and actually serving.

17

So my question to you, Superintendent Johnson is, what

18

is the policy with the 11th and 12th working together?

19

They are worried about

SUPERINTENDENT JOHNSON:

Although, we don't

20

manage them from the headquarters, 11th and 12th should

21

be working together.

11

MR. PERRYMAN:

And the last one, we have

12

several trouble buildings and a troubled business.

Can

13

we ask that those buildings be fast tracked in any

14

actions that have been taken by the City?

PRESIDENT FOREMAN:

The next speaker is John

Catanzara?

7

MR. CATANZARA:

My first question is for

8

COPA.

Miss Roberts isn't here.

A few months ago I

9

asked her when the Rialmo case was originally referred

10

to the full Board and Miss Delgado, there were two

11

independent investigators that were sent a package over

12

and determined that the shooting was justified.

13

those two independent counsels turned over to her

14

before she made her decision to refer it to the whole

15

Board?

16

of she was new.

17

she would look into it and never got back to me.

18

think that should have been turned over to make her

19

decision.

20

right answer before you push your decision forward,

21

when you've got two people that you paid for and that

22

wasn't good enough and stick it in the drawer and find

23

someone so you could put a guy out to dry.

24

could look, I'm going to be back for an answer, whether

She promised me an answer.

Thank

Superintendent, the definition of

4

"obstruction" is a person who obstructs justice with

5

the intent to prevent the apprehension or obstruct the

6

prosecution or defense of any person he or she knowing

7

commits a crime of the following acts, destroy, alters

8

or conceals physical evidence.

accountable.
