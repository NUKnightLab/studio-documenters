CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

All right.

We will call

4

the meeting to order at 10:07.

Okay.

We'll

5

start with the minutes from the February board

6

meeting.

7

And I think we'll hold all the votes until the

8

end, but just if there are any questions on the

9

February minutes.

10

MS. DARLING:

Hopefully everyone has reviewed them.

No.
Just a quick update on

11

upcoming meeting dates.

12

12th meeting has been scheduled since the end of

13

last year.

14

continued thank you to Mary Sue Barrett and

15

Metropolitan Planning Council for continuing to

16

graciously host us.

17

The Tuesday, September

It will be here at MPC again.

A

And Tuesday, December 5th meeting is a

18

slight change.

It was originally scheduled for

19

December 6th, but we had a scheduling conflict

20

so we moved that to December 5th.

21

to 12:00 here at MPC.

Again, 10:00

22

Patty will be reaching out to your

23

offices in short order to start to talk about

And any questions on upcoming meetings?

2

Oh, just a quick note, the MPC has

3

another event here at noon.

4

cutoff today and have to vacate the room a little

5

earlier as typical, but with our agenda today I

6

think we will be able to get through it with

7

plenty of time to spare so MPC can host their

8

event here as well.

9

moving through.

10

Okay.

So we have an early

So thanks for everybody for

Any questions on that?
Quickly some organizational

11

matters and updates.

12

Falk, from Kirkland & Ellis who is typically here

13

had a family emergency this morning so he is

14

unable to join us today.

15

and we will see him at the next meeting of

16

course.

17

So first our Counsel, Scott

He sends his apologies

It continues to be an exceptionally

18

busy time at the CIT since we last met in

19

February.

20

the City on executing the smart lighting contract

21

which we expect will be executed very soon.

22

will continue to be providing more details on

23

that later in the meeting.

24

We have been working diligently with

And, also, as you all know we have

We

1

been asked to take on a new project, a design

2

build finance project for the Department of Fleet

3

and Facilities Management for which we issued an

4

RFP last week.

5

and we'll provide a lot more details later in the

6

meeting.

7

We are very excited about that

But needless to say for our very small

8

staff these projects consume a tremendous amount

9

of time and require a tremendous focus and

10

tenacity.

11

the staff and also to you as our board.

12

really have been working hard and I would be

13

remiss if I didn't recognize everybody on the

14

team for bringing it all together and making

15

great things happen for the City.

16

to them and to you.

17

So a quick thank you to everybody on
We

So thank you

Internally at the last board meeting I

18

promised you that we would bring a new employee

19

manual for your approval.

20

and our pro bono partners at Kirkland & Ellis for

21

creating this new document which I will also

22

address shortly.

23
24

I want to thank Patty

We also told you in February we would
bring the 2016 audit to you and we -- I want to

shortly as they present the 2016 audit.

5

you for your hard work, Hilda and Yesenia.

6

And you will hear from them

And just a quick update.

So thank

I was

7

recently asked to represent the CIT at the Better

8

Buildings Summit in Washington D.C. which is the

9

U.S. Department of Energy program that is a

10

conference that brings together almost a thousand

11

state, local and federal government officials and

12

industry professionals to talk about best

13

practices in energy management and reducing

14

energy use throughout the country.

15

They asked us to share our experience

16

on the smart lighting project which is starting

17

to look like a model that other cities are very

18

interested in utilizing.

19

share experience and I've been asked to lead some

20

breakout sessions on street lighting and

21

municipal street lighting.

22

to attend this to make sure that we paid it

23

forward.

24

And we were asked to

So we really wanted

When we were in our due diligence

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - June 6, 2017

1

phase we relied on a number of cities to provide

2

great advice to us and -- cities like New York,

3

LA and many, many other cities that we talked to

4

were incredibly helpful, and we wanted to share

5

that information and pay it forward.

6

that's been -- we've been doing that not only at

7

the Better Building Summit, but we have been

8

asked to help advise some other cities and

9

provide our best practices and our learnings from

And so

10

our experience and we have been doing that and

11

have some calls scheduled with some other cities

12

coming up.

13

advice to others.

14

And we are please to provide that

We have a few staff changes coming up.

15

Our interns, Eddie Bonneau and Claudell CJ

16

Robertson.

17

And Eddie wasn't able to join us.

18

students at DePaul.

19

from DePaul so we wish him congratulations.

20

he has found a full-time position and so we wish

21

him well in that.

22

joining Discover Card this summer for a summer

23

residential program where he'll be working on

24

international issues for Discover.

CJ is here.

There he is in the back.
But both are

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - June 6, 2017

1

wish them both the best and we will miss them

2

very much.

3

They were tremendous assets.
And then just to reintroduce to you

Sean Dowd.

He is a fellow with the CIT and he is

a joint JD MBA candidate at Northwestern

University.

feet and been a tremendous asset to us both on

8

the smart lighting and on our new DBF RFP for

9

fleet and facility management.

And he's really jumped in with both

So we are excited

10

to recognize Eddie and CJ as they sort of

11

graduate from the CIT, but also look forward to

12

continuing to work with Sean.

13

So moving on to the employee handbook.

14

Today I am going to ask you to adopt a new CIT

15

employee handbook which you were provided last

16

week.

17

edit to you last night and you should have a hard

18

copy before you as well of the new handbook.

And I had sent a very brief, but small

19

We know that employee handbooks must

20

be living documents and continually reviewed to

21

make sure that best practices are incorporated

22

consistently.

23

it's imperative that our team has a clear

24

understanding of expectations for both employees

Even though we are very small,

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

7

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - June 6, 2017

1

and for management.

2

Our goal was to create a very clear

3

streamlined handbook and I think we have achieved

4

that with a great assistance from our partners at

5

Kirkland.

6

You can see these highlights on the

7

slide, but the CIT maintains a commitment to

8

diversity.

9

policy, code of ethics and conduct and

10

We have a fulsome complex of interest

11

I hope you had a chance to review the

document.

the future.

14

from time to time with amendments to insure our

15

handbook stays up to date.

I agree that it won't fit our needs in

putting this together.

MS. HUBBARD:

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

6

MS. DARLING:

No questions from me.
All right.

Now we'll turn it over to

7

Hilda Renteria and Yesenia Hernandez from Prado &

8

Renteria to present our 2016 audited financial

9

statements.

10

MS. RENTERIA:

Our presentation will cover 2 areas,

1

Under audit highlights we will go over

the auditor's opinion, the 2016 financial

statement restatement, 2016 financial statement

4

highlights.

5

go over the auditor's responsibilities, audit

6

results and other matters.

7

Under required communication we'll

In regards to the auditor's report,

our opinion on the financial statements is an

unmodified opinion which means it's a clean

10

opinion.

11

emphasis of matter paragraph.

12

this paragraph is to inform the reader about the

13

restatement of the prior year's financial

14

statements.

15

This year the auditor's report has an
The purpose of

The restatement relates to the

16

Retrofit One project which started in 2014.

17

2014 CIT did not include the activities of this

18

project on the financial statements.

19

CIT's management revisited the accounting for the

20

project and concluded that it should be reported

21

on the CIT's financial statements.

22

approach is consistent with accounting principles

23

and guidelines.

24

In 2016

And that

The restatement resulted in the 2014

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - June 6, 2017

1

financial statement assets, liabilities and net

2

assets being restated to reflect the activities

3

of the project in 2014.

4

the assets, liabilities and net assets of --

5

related to the project are reflected now in the

6

restated financial statements.

7

And similarly for 2015

And on the next two slides we will

8

present the impact of the restatement to the

9

financial statements.

We will start with the

10

statement of financial position.

11

the restatement as you can see on this slide is

12

an increase in total assets, total liabilities

13

and total net assets.

14

The impact of

The increase in assets represents the

15

addition of the energy conservation measure

16

assets that were created as part of the project.

17

They are now reflected as an asset on your

18

financial statements.

19

The increase in total liabilities

20

consists of the financing, the notes payable that

21

were issued in 2014 to finance the project and

22

the increase in total net assets.

23

cumulative results of the operations of that

24

project.

It's the

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

11

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - June 6, 2017

1

Moving on to the statement of

2

activities.

3

can see here is an increase to revenues, expenses

4

and change in net assets for 2015.

5

The impact of the restatement as you

For 2014 the net impact of all the

6

activities was a negative impact to net assets.

7

The increase in revenue consists of the energy

8

savings fees that CIT earns under this agreement,

9

the Retrofit One Project agreement.

The increase

10

in expenses in 2015 was mainly the amortization

11

of finance costs.

12

Okay.

And here you can see that

13

there's a positive change in net assets which you

14

can look at it as like the net -- sort of like

15

the net income of the -- of this project on CIT's

16

financial statements.

17

Okay.

So now I'm switching to the

18

highlights related to the 2016 financial

19

statements in comparison to the restated 2015

20

financial statements.

21

with the statement of financial position.

22

Okay.

So we are starting

Total assets and total liabilities

23

decreased 3 percent and 8 percent as you can see.

24

And total net assets increased by 53 percent.
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

12

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - June 6, 2017

1

The decrease in total assets consists of a

2

reduction of mainly of investments that were

3

redeemed and used for building the Retrofit One

4

Project assets.

5

On the total liability side the

6

decrease represents mainly payments on the debt

7

that was -- that's outstanding regarding the

8

Retrofit One Project.

9

assets represents, again, the cumulative impact

The increase in total net

10

of positive results for 2016.

11

that on the next slide.

12

And we will see

So this is the statement of

13

activities.

14

see that both total revenues and total expenses

15

increased.

16

attributed, again, to CIT earning energy saving

17

fees under the Retrofit One Project.

18

In the statement of activities we

Total revenues the increase is

Under total expenses the increase is

19

attributed to an increase in interest expense due

20

to the debt that's outstanding and also

21

depreciation of the assets that were created as

22

part of the Retrofit One Project.

23
24

And you can see here that the results
of operations for 2016 is a positive number.
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

13

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - June 6, 2017

1

When compared to 2015, it's a decrease.

2

that's attributed again to an increase in the

3

expenses, interest and depreciation.

4

And

So I think this concludes our

5

presentation on the financial statements.

6

will move on to the presentation of the required

7

communication with those charged with governance.

8
9

We

Our professional standards require
that we cover these points with you.

So the

10

first one is auditor's responsibility.

11

responsibility has been communicated to

12

management in our engagement letter dated

13

September 14, 2016.

14

the financial statements for the year ended

15

December 31, 2016.

16

Our

And we were engaged to order

We are required to report to you that

17

management is responsible for the selection and

18

use of appropriate accounting principles.

19

significant accounting policies used by CIT are

20

described in note two.

21

one, but it's really -- it's an error.

22

be note two to the financial statements.

The

On the slide it says note
It should

23

There were no new accounting policies

24

adopted and the application of existing policies
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

14

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - June 6, 2017

1

was not changed during 2016.

2

difficulties encountered in performing the audit.

3

There were no disagreements with management.

4

there were no consultation with other accountants

5

that we know of.

6

There were no

And

Significant issues that we discussed

7

with management were mainly the restatement of

8

the prior year financial statements and there is

9

details about that in notes one and two to the

10

financial statements.

11

Written communications between

12

management and our firm are documented in the

13

client representation letter.

14

audit and communication with management, all

15

significant transactions have been recognized in

16

the financial statements.

17

And based on our

As far as other matters, we are

18

required to report that we are independent of the

19

Chicago Infrastructure Trust.

20

much what we wanted to present.

21

questions, we will be happy to answer those

22

questions.

23
24

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:
no questions.

And that's pretty
If there is any

All right.

Sounds like

I think just great work by Leslie

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

15

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - June 6, 2017

1

and the team and originally identifying this need

2

and working with Prado & Renteria to solve for

3

it.

4

MS. DARLING:

Thank you, Chairman.

If I

5

could just add quickly the restatement is as

6

Hilda mentioned a technical change with no impact

7

on the CIT's financial condition.

8

is to continually and comprehensively review the

9

operations of the CIT to insure that we are

My directive

10

generating maximum benefit for Chicago taxpayers.

11

And so the comprehensive review by us led to the

12

reexamination of the historical accounting

13

treatment of the Retrofit One transaction and it

14

led to the technical change we are making today.

15

So if there are no questions, we'll

16

request that you approve and accept the CIT's

17

financial statements.

18

going to hold all the votes until the end.

19

if there are no questions, we can move on.

20

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

21

MS. DARLING:

22
23
24

And as Kurt said, we are
But

Sounds good.

So now quickly we'll provide

some project updates.
MR. SILVERS:

Can I just say a word to you

before we move on from this item?
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

16

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - June 6, 2017

1

MS. DARLING:

Oh, sure.

I'm sorry, Damon.

2

I wasn't sure that you had gotten on the phone.

3

So Kym Hubbard -- just for the record, Julie, Kym

4

Hubbard and Damon Silvers are on the phone.

5

Damon and Kym, thank you both for making the

6

time.

7

really appreciate you calling in.

8

And,

Damon, I know you are on travel so we

MR. SILVERS:

Not at all.

I want to note

9

that -- I want to note a couple of things here.

10

Maybe, you know, maybe there is, you know, as a

11

result of, you know, somewhat of what I'm going

12

to say, you know, maybe Leslie you may want to

13

add something further here.

14

I just want to note that, you know,

15

this was brought to my attention as -- this

16

accounting matter was brought to my attention as

17

an advisory board member by Leslie on behalf of

18

the management team.

19

commendable that the team identified and has

20

worked with the auditors to get -- the auditors

21

to correct this.

I think it is really

22

It is my belief that while this is --

23

that this matter is -- that this matter is not a

24

-- does not alter the fundamental financial

picture of the Trust.

2

about that, but I don't think it's necessary why

3

that's so.

4

corrected.

5

And I can go into detail

But it is important that it be

And it's my understanding that some

6

additional steps have been taken vis-à-vis

7

finding that the background here and the role

8

that I guess under prior management was played by

9

the outside preparers of audits or of our

10

financial statements.

11

something you want to -- you want to address

12

here.

13

And, Leslie, maybe this is

I thought it was important that we

14

have a clear understanding as a trust as to how

15

this -- how this -- how this mistake came to be

16

made.

17

see -- that we were not seeing repetition of it.

18

I feel comfortable about all those things, but

19

you may want to add to it.

20

And we were confident that we would not

MS. DARLING:

Sure.

So the project at the

21

time utilized an innovative financing structure

22

with limited precedent transactions to guide the

23

accounting treatment for the transaction.

24

the time the transaction closed, CIT management

And at

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

18

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - June 6, 2017

1

determined that the transaction did not need to

2

be reflected on the CIT's financials.

3

However, after a thorough review of

4

the project documentation, the -- our team, the

5

new CIT management, requested its accountant and

6

auditors reevaluate the Retrofit One initial

7

treatment.

8

transaction should be recorded on the CIT's

9

financial statements as reflected in this

10

And the parties all agreed that the

restatement.

11

And as you know the auditor that we

12

are working with is not the same auditor that

13

represented the CIT in -- when the transaction

14

occurred in 2014.

15

with our reading of the documents.

16

agreed that it should be so reflected on our

17

statement.

And so Prado & Renteria agreed

18

MR. SILVERS:

Okay.

19

MS. DARLING:

Thanks, Damon.

20

MR. SILVERS:

Thank you.

And we all

And let me again

21

reiterate I think it's commendable that

22

management identified and addressed this, you

23

know, on their own.

24

behave very differently in a lot of different

circumstances.

And so it's really comforting to

2

know that that's the approach that you're taking,

3

Leslie.

MS. DARLING:

5

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

6
7

Thank you.
Okay.

I appreciate it.
Back to the

project updates.
MS. DARLING:

Okay.

Moving on to project

8

updates.

We wanted to briefly share with you

9

where we are and what's happened since the

10

February board meeting on the Smart Lighting

11

Project.

12

I know you all have heard a great deal

13

about that for all of the board meetings that

14

you've attended.

15

provide great detail except at the February board

16

meeting you recommended and voted to move forward

17

with the recommended vendor who at the time was

18

not disclosed in order to get through the

19

contract negotiations and not announce it before

20

it was announced to City Council.

21

So I won't take any time to

But as you all know that is the

22

Ameresco team which was announced by the Mayor of

23

their selection.

24

in February right after the board meeting.

And contract negotiations began

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

20

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - June 6, 2017

1

In March those contract negotiations

2

had moved forward enough that we could introduce

3

the ordinance to City Council.

4

know many of you who have worked on these large

5

transaction -- large transactions or are

6

attorneys, this was a very aggressive contract

7

negotiating schedule.

8
9

So as you all

And so we had a contract that we felt
we could introduce in March.

And after an

10

exciting few weeks of many briefings with

11

Aldermen, the ordinance was approved by City

12

Council in April.

13

with the -- finishing the contract negotiations

14

and finalizing all of the details with the vendor

15

team.

That allowed us to continue

16

We are currently very close to being

17

able to finalize our contractual terms and wrap

18

this up.

19

currently in a number of locations and in a

20

number of contexts.

21

contractual obligation of both parties to make

22

sure that we are -- that we have the right

23

fixtures in the contract and make sure that the

24

ones that the City is ordering actually work

We are field testing the LED fixtures

That is part of the

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

21

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - June 6, 2017

1

according to the technical information that's

2

provided.

3

I am happy to report that the great

4

majority of them do and are meeting the

5

expectations of the City.

6

that will be wrapping up very soon and we're

7

really excited to kick off the actual project and

8

be finished with the contractual phase.

9
10
11

And so we expect that

Tom or George, is there anything you
want to add to the update on the smart lighting?
MR. MARQUISOS:

No, it's an -- as everyone

12

knows it's a pretty complicated transaction.

13

are introducing technology as well as converting

14

to LED.

15

make sure that we're documenting and getting

16

credit for the energy reductions.

17

been a lot of back and forth on how the

18

technology is going to roll out and which parts

19

of the City are going to see the lights first and

20

communications.

21

We

And there's a lot of moving pieces to

And so there's

And so it's been -- even though it

22

seems like a long period of time when I look at

23

this slide; but we've been working very, very

24

hard and I want to commend the Ameresco team for
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

22

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - June 6, 2017

1

really putting forth the effort to do everything

2

on their part to give us all the information and

3

work with us with all the final language.

4

very close and I would expect this contract to be

5

ready for signature very shortly.

6

MS. DARLING:

We are

And a special thanks to Tom

7

and George who have been really nose down working

8

incredibly hard on getting through all these

9

final details.

As George mentioned it's

10

incredibly complex and we're doing this

11

comprehensive project unlike other cities.

12

so as George said there are a ton of moving

13

pieces.

14

work they've put in on this.

15

And

And so I commend them for all the hard

A quick update on Home Buyer's

16

Assistance.

We now have 19 approved lenders that

17

are operating in the program.

18

in 40 out of the 50 City wards.

19

week we've closed 124 loans.

20

currently open pending closure.

21

have become pre-qualified in the program.

22

that is a total of over $50 million.

We've closed loans
And as of last

40 loans are
And 91 borrowers
And

23

So we are pleased that the project or

24

the program is continuing and has picked up some
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services

23

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - June 6, 2017

1

speed over the spring.

2

to that continuing through the fall.

3

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

And we're looking forward

Just to -- generally

4

speaking is the profile of the borrower similar

5

to what we reviewed at least for the 2016

6

profile --

7

MS. DARLING:

Yes, absolutely.

So they are

8

meeting the credit score requirements obviously.

9

But they're generally low to middle income

10

working families in Chicago.

11

reaching the exact demographic that we were

12

focussing on.

13

project is moving forward.

14

And so it's really

So we're pleased with how the

MR. LINGENFELTER:

Just note that a couple

15

of those 40 loans close together with the smart

16

lighting and the retrofit, we'll be over $200

17

million.

18
19

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:
wards are.

It's not 24.

Figure out what those 10
I know that.

20

MS. DARLING:

21

MR. SCOTT:

22

MS. DARLING:

It's not 24.

23

MR. RAMIREZ:

Can I ask a question about

24

that?

No, it's not 24.

It's not 24.

Is there any way to -- maybe the next
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

24

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - June 6, 2017

1

iteration of it or something, the Home Buyer's

2

Assistance Program, is there any way to do some

3

type of bundle with automobile or anything like

4

that?

5

of these folks when they're looking for work, a

6

lot of the stuff that they're looking for it

7

requires them -- and it's not all public

8

transportation accessible to some of these

9

opportunities.

The reason why I ask is, you know, a lot

A lot of it is they need a car.

10

You know, it's nice to have a new home, but you

11

need a car to get to work to so you can pay for

12

the new home.

13

down the road and see if we could --

Is there any way to look at that

14

MS. DARLING:

15

our City partner.

16

and it's something we can certainly look into.

17

It's not something I thought of before, but

18

that's an excellent point.

19

MR. RAMIREZ:

I'll absolutely bring it up to
And I think it's a great idea

Well, I mean, a lot of it is

20

on-the-job training.

I mean, you have the

21

president of the building trades here, Ralph

22

Affrunti, I mean, he'll tell you that, you know,

23

a lot of the guys and gals, people that are

24

working on the trades and trying to, you know,
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

25

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - June 6, 2017

1

you have to have an automobile.

2

tools and you're moving things around.

3

to be able to go where the work is.

4

You are hauling
You have

And it's great to have the home to

5

come back to and everything, but you've got to be

6

able to get -- could change day to day week to

7

week.

8

efforts in the City towards getting folks into

9

some of these opportunities, we're going to have

And if we're going to be gearing other

10

to have the ability for them to get around beyond

11

public transportation.

12

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

It's an interesting idea.

13

I mean, honestly I think it's all about the

14

lenders.

15

only role the City proper its only role here is

16

administrative.

17

structuring it as we did with our advisory, it's

18

really about getting the lenders.

19

guys will remember, 19 approved lenders is a big

20

deal.

You know, it's less about -- the City's

It's really -- and sort of in

21

MR. RAMIREZ:

22

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

23
24

And if you

Huge.
When we started it was

like three.
MR. RAMIREZ:

That's great.

But, I mean,

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

26

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - June 6, 2017

27

1

maybe the success of this program -- like I said,

2

maybe the next iteration will be something --

3

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

So my point is let's

4

start with those 19 lenders and say, hey, since

5

we have had some success here, let's look at

6

other types of consumer lending that we need.

7

big one is auto.

8
9

MR. RAMIREZ:

The initial thought that I had

with this is when we have certain folks in

10

Chicago and immediately, you know, surrounding

11

the area that make cars.

12

could approach them and say --

13

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

14

MR. RAMIREZ:

You know, maybe we

Interesting.

And work that angle.

Use a

15

car that was made here produced by folks that

16

work here.

17

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

18

MR. RAMIREZ:

19
20
21
22
23
24

A

Right.

That would help you move

around.
MS. DARLING:

I like where you're going with

this, Jorge.
CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

I'm just surprised that

you have that perspective.
MR. RAMIREZ:

It's my one good idea for the

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - June 6, 2017

1
2

year and it's already June.
MS. DARLING:

I think what I would love to

3

do is maybe follow up with you and Kurt offline

4

and we can talk about a strategy to see what we

5

can do to facilitate that.

6

-- you have good contacts in the community not

7

just with lenders, but with the auto makers,

8

etcetera; might be the key to making something

9

happen.

You know, anything we

Let's talk about that.

10

great idea.

11

forward.

But that's a

I appreciate you bringing it

12

MR. RAMIREZ:

Sure.

13

MS. DARLING:

Okay.

Retrofit One.

This

14

slide is just to indicate that all of the 2016

15

energy savings reports are in and have been

16

accepted by the City.

17

The -- all of the ESCO's exceeded

18

their guaranteed savings.

19

the savings goals by $71,573.00.

20

that, you know, their guarantee is just that.

21

And we expect that we will be able to continue to

22

do that going forward.

23

MR. RAMIREZ:

24

You can see they beat
And we expect

So go ahead.

This is the last comment I

hope I will make during the meeting; but this is
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

28

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - June 6, 2017

1

a big deal especially if you start looking for

2

programs down the road and scalability, you know.

3

And the argument that we would make partnering

4

with other governments to maybe do a bigger

5

project down the road.

6

exactly where -- you know, I wish there was the

7

same media presence here that was when they don't

8

like something, but this is -- this is something

9

that I think is worth touting and this is kind of

But, I mean, this is

10

proof that the experiment works.

11

things work.

12

Right.

That

You know, I just -- it's upsetting not

13

to see this on the front page of the, you know,

14

newspapers.

15

way.

16

the Sun-Times, but maybe -- I mean, this is

17

something worth touting.

18

stuff that we should be proud of as a board and

19

we should not be shy about talking about it.

20

Maybe that will change soon by the

But -- maybe they'll get new ownership of

MS. DARLING:

No.

I just -- I think it's

So first I want to thank

21

you for that comment.

And I think that the

22

important point to make about that and I think,

23

you know, what you are certainly alluding to is

24

all the money that the City would have spent on
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

29

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - June 6, 2017

1

their energy bill instead of paying to ComEd and

2

the City's energy providers; instead of going to

3

pay for the energy bill, that money has gone to

4

pay for modernization of the City's buildings.

5

It's 60 buildings throughout the city.

6

savings have been realized.

7

going directly to the modernization that is

8

desperately needed, the chillers, the energy

9

savings and the energy equipment.

10

Energy

And that money is

And we, you know, we talked a lot

11

about that in here, but I think that's -- I

12

appreciate you bringing that up and that's an

13

important point to make.

14

MR. RAMIREZ:

Do we know anecdotally how

15

many of these were schools and stuff like that

16

because, I mean --

17

MS. DARLING:

No.

18

MR. RAMIREZ:

No. Okay.

19

MR. MARQUISOS:

20
21

All right.

There are no schools in the

program.
MR. SCOTT:

I would like to echo that as

22

well and just to go back about the lighting

23

project.

24

excited the community is to know that in a few

I don't think that everybody knows how

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

30

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - June 6, 2017

1

months, in a couple years that all these streets

2

will be relamped and there will be more efficient

3

and more effective lighting that is going to help

4

the City.

5

I realize that every day because I get

6

calls from individuals who are asking me to use

7

menu money to relamp their blocks.

8

explain to them that in a matter of three years

9

the entire City will be relamped and then we can

10

go in and talk about targeted infrastructure and

11

improvement, but people are so excited to

12

understand that they're going to have brand new

13

LED lighting.

14

them feel safer walking from their door to their

15

car.

16

And when I

Something that is going to help

And I don't think that the board --

17

and I just wanted to make sure that the board is

18

aware of the excitement and the buzz that's going

19

out in neighborhoods like mine that desperately

20

need new lighting and desperately need this

21

bright light to help reduce crime and to help

22

keep some of the things that we're all trying to

23

realize across the City to do that.

24

And making sure that we are doing that
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

31

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - June 6, 2017

1

effectively and efficiently and making sure that

2

we are going through every precaution to make

3

sure that this lighting is going to be not only

4

safe for the physical environment, but safe for,

5

you know, us physically and emotionally as

6

humans; I think goes a long way.

7

just like to thank the board for their

8

thoroughness and due diligence in making sure

9

that this process is done and done fairly and

10
11
12

equitably across the City.
MR. RAMIREZ:

MR. SCOTT:

14

MS. DARLING:

15

MR. SCOTT:

17

So thank you.

Put the dimmer switch for his

ward by his bed.

13

16

And so I would

I need that.
That's not an offer quite yet.

Well, when it does I need that.

When it happens I need it.
MS. DARLING:

Any other comments or

18

questions before we move on to the North and

19

Throop relocation project?

20

Okay.

So this is the new project that

21

you've all heard about recently and we issued the

22

RFP last week and we were excited to be asked by

23

2FM and the City to develop and run this

24

procurement and manage this project on their
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

32

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - June 6, 2017

1

behalf.

2

So we are seeking a developer to

3

design, construct and finance the capital cost

4

associated with the development of three

5

facilities to replace the City's existing

6

Department of Fleet and Facilities Management

7

operations that is located at 1685 North Throop.

8

It's just to the north and west of the Home Depot

9

at -- on North Avenue.

10

And that property is currently for

11

sale.

It is adjacent to the Finkl Steel property

12

and is part of the larger river redevelopment

13

project that the City is currently working on.

14

And so this land is very valuable and the City

15

has determined and the Mayor announced recently

16

that the operations of Fleet and Facilities

17

Management would be moving to Englewood, the

18

headquarters would be moving to Englewood and

19

also their large maintenance and repair shop.

20

And then as you know and I just

21

mentioned, I'm sorry, that the property is

22

currently on the market and there has been a call

23

to operations recently on that property.

24

So there will be 3 sites involved.
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

33

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - June 6, 2017

1

Site 1 is going to be located at 6800 South

2

Wentworth in Englewood.

3

former Kennedy King College.

4

approximately 200,000 square feet of new

5

construction.

6

the heavy duty truck maintenance and repair

7

shops.

8

It's where they repair everything from large fire

9

trucks, street sweepers, every City fleet vehicle

That's the site of the
It will be

And as I mentioned it will be for

It involves a great number of lifts.

10

you can imagine.

11

the North and Throop facility and will be moving

12

down to Englewood.

13

And those are currently done at

There will be a satellite vehicle

14

maintenance repair shop that will be on the north

15

side, a small shop about 30,000 square feet.

16

that potentially will be located at 4243 North

17

Neenah.

18

And

And then site 3 is the movement of the

19

City of Chicago fueling station which is

20

currently at the North and Throop location and

21

that will be moving to Goose Island to 1150 North

22

Branch.

23
24

And that includes a demolition project
of the streets and san building prior to that

34

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - June 6, 2017

1

construction.

2

the property that will be relocated.

3

going to ask Tom quickly to talk about the

4

structure.

5

because he ably wrote it.

6

So those are the three aspects of
And I am

And the reason I am doing that is

MR. BUDESCU:

I think as kind of a preface

7

to the slide as Leslie mentioned the current

8

facilities are located at 1685 North Throop and

9

the City has put that location for sale.

And the

10

idea here is to try to utilize the future

11

proceeds of that sale to facilitate the

12

construction, the design and construction of

13

these new -- replacement facilities as soon as

14

possible.

15

And I think, you know, when we sat

16

down with the City to discuss this project, their

17

biggest concern was to say time is of the

18

essence.

19

contractual and procurement structure that can

20

facilitate the delivery of these new facilities

21

as soon as possible.

22

guiding force in how we structured this

23

procurement in trying to put forward something

24

that will get us the new facilities as soon as

So we really want to think of a

And that's kind of been the

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

35

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - June 6, 2017

1

possible, but also insure really great value to

2

the taxpayers of Chicago.

3

And so we have come up with a bit of

4

an innovative structure.

5

Tuesday and it's -- it will commence a two-phase

6

project delivery structure.

7

respondents to demonstrate their qualifications

8

to construct and design and finance the

9

facilities.

10

We issued an RFP last

The RFP will ask the

We will then be asking the highest

11

ranked respondent to commence a design

12

development phase with the City and the CIT as

13

part of the final selection process.

14

phase the respondent will work in collaboration

15

with the City and the CIT to refine and finalize

16

the design for the three facilities and confirm,

17

but not to exceed, a guaranteed maximum price for

18

the project.

19

survey work permits and zoning and secure the

20

project specific financing for the construction

21

of the -- design and construction of the project.

During that

Work on obtaining the necessary

22

Once that design development phase is

23

successfully completed, we anticipate executing,

24

subject to City Council approval, a design build
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

36

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - June 6, 2017

1

finance agreement with that selected respondent.

2

That contract will incorporate the final design,

3

the maximum guaranteed not to exceed price, the

4

payment and financing terms and the terms and

5

conditions during the design and construction of

6

the project.

7

document for the construction of the project.

8
9

And that will be the governing

They will be financing the full
capital costs.

And over some defined term as the

10

funding for the City becomes available, they will

11

be repaid for the design and construction and

12

financing costs of the project.

13

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

Do you see any sort of

14

prospects for material differences between this

15

process that we'll be running and what a typical

16

sort of City run planning department process

17

would be?

18
19
20

MS. DARLING:

Go ahead.

You can start and

I'll -MR. BUDESCU:

Yes, so for one thing I think,

21

you know, what the developer will be financing

22

against is a design build finance contract which

23

is a payment commitment by the City, but there's

24

no asset or title which they own to finance
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

37

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - June 6, 2017

1

against.

So this is not a typical financing

2

structure that the City utilizes.

3

And I think the other unique aspect is

4

the design development phase where we're going to

5

be having this collaborative design process as

6

part of the selection process for the RFP prior

7

to the construction -- prior to the execution of

8

the project agreement.

9

the first design build finance agreement that the

And I think this will be

10

City has entered into today that the project

11

achieves -- if we get to a successful completion

12

of a procurement and execute the design build

13

finance agreement.

14

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

Yes, so that's kind of

15

where I was going.

16

not the normal course and -- but very forward

17

thinking and very different.

18

know, encouraging it.

19

this.

20

This is, you know, obviously

And I think, you

We've been asked to do

The -- given that it's -- it would be

21

sort of the first of its kind in Chicago I think,

22

you know, what I would encourage the staff to

23

think about and make the board aware of sort of

24

any -- as you do your work I'm sure around the
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services

38

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - June 6, 2017

1

country for not only best practices, but the sort

2

of the horror stories and where design build

3

finance efforts have succeeded and failed kind of

4

making us aware in where we can -- because we,

5

you know, want to be a resource to the team.

6

Where we can be helpful there.

7

And I think really every member of

8

this board has an ability to -- we want to do so,

9

but I think it requires us having kind of full

10

understanding of where the potential pitfalls are

11

or what the -- not pitfalls, but what the more

12

challenging parts of it like financing and then

13

clear, you know, third-party arrangement, you

14

know, vis-à-vis the City or the agency that will

15

take over the building.

16

So helping us understand that between

17

now and the next board meeting would be helpful

18

given that I suspect this is going to by design

19

move quickly.

20

MR. BUDESCU:

Yes.

21

MS. DARLING:

And it is designed to move

22

very quickly.

I think the commissioner of 2FM

23

his position is that the land becomes more

24

valuable if there's a date certain that they will
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

39

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - June 6, 2017

1

be vacating the premises.

And so that's part of

2

the background of why this is moving on such a

3

fast timeline.

4

I do want to add that while this is an

5

innovative structure the, you know, the terms and

6

conditions will continue to be the same terms and

7

conditions utilized by the City.

8

still being done under the rubric of a City

9

contract.

10

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

11

MS. DARLING:

So this is

Right, for procurement.

For procurement purposes.

So

12

just wanted to clarify that.

But absolutely we

13

will keep everyone apprised and, you know, this

14

board is a wealth of information and expertise

15

and you've been invaluable to us and so we want

16

to make sure that not only are you informed, but

17

we are getting input from you as well.

18

And so we will continue to communicate

19

with you through the course of the project to get

20

your feedback.

21

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

Yes.

22

MR. LINGENFELTER:

Maybe just to follow a

23

little on that and just in the context of the

24

audit, so the asset will be the City's new

building.

2

financing during the project, right.

3

execution risk falls back to the developer

4

because they are subject to the financing until

5

the project is complete at which point we would

6

pay for it, right.

7

The developer will be doing the

MR. BUDESCU:

8

correct.

9

negotiated.

So the

So just that's largely

I think this part hasn't been fully
This is part of what we will be

10

refining during the design development phase.

11

I think our initial talks with the

12

City when you do a design build finance agreement

13

you can structure it in one of two ways.

14

is a true project finance structure in which

15

payment -- any repayment is triggered by

16

substantial completion of the asset meaning that

17

the lenders and the developers hold full

18

construction risk on their balance sheet during

19

construction for the financing.

20

There

I think we are going to approach it

21

with the receivable structure which is more

22

common domestically for a variety of reasons

23

which we can discuss if you would like, but it

24

basically is more of a deferred payment structure
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

41

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - June 6, 2017

1

where payment is -- you have a defined schedule

2

availability of funding and you are able to

3

receive payment against your receivables based on

4

that schedule for accepted work.

5

So you would never get the full

6

payment if you didn't complete the work.

7

you completed a portion of the work and it was

8

accepted and then that funding becomes available

9

in that predefined schedule, you would be able to

10
11

receive that portion of the funding.
CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

How sort of small are the

12

portions of the -- you get what I mean?

13

we talking three milestones?

14

know, sort of --

15

But if

MR. BUDESCU:

Like are

Are we talking, you

Well, we're talking about an

16

eight-to ten-month construction period.

17

is a project that once we have a notice to

18

proceed on the construction is going to go up

19

pretty quickly.

20

gotten that granular.

21

but my thought is you are probably going to look

22

at a monthly progress payment structure.

23
24

So this

And so, you know, we haven't

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

I would defer to George,

So just to put the

context of the -- in terms of the financing that
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

42

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - June 6, 2017

1

has to be secured by the developer, we're talking

2

about like a 12-month financing vehicle?

3

MR. BUDESCU:

Well, we're talking about an

4

-- we're talking about an up to five-year term

5

because we are date uncertain on the availability

6

of the funding of the City.

7

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

8

MR. BUDESCU:

9
10

So they might be --

I see.

-- finished with the

construction -CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

So they could be finished

11

and still have -- so the progress payments don't

12

get to full funding so you're looking at a

13

five-year vehicle.

14

MR. BUDESCU:

Yes.

15

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

That will have some

16

amount paid through the completion of

17

construction.

18

based upon availability of funds from the City?

19

And then some element will be

MR. BUDESCU:

Yes, so they will use the

20

financing vehicle to fully fund the construction.

21

And then the availability of funding from the

22

City to repay the contractor for that funding

23

will be based on that funding schedule.

24

we're asking for a -- preliminarily we're asking

And

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

43

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - June 6, 2017

1

for a five-year term with the ability to sort of

2

define prepayment.

3

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

Yes, that's what I'm

4

getting at.

So the five-year term is with the

5

developer, the contractor.

6

MR. BUDESCU:

7

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

8
9
10
11
12
13
14
15

Yes.
Not with the financial

institution, correct?
MR. BUDESCU:

Yes, correct.

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

That all depends on how

much risk they want to take.
MR. BUDESCU:

Absolutely.

We will have no

direct contractual relationship with the lender.
CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

Got it.

That's what I

was --

16

MR. BUDESCU:

And the developer, yes.

17

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

18

MS. DARLING:

Okay.

But most of it is very subject

19

to negotiations since we are not, you know, we

20

are not quite there yet.

21

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

No, understood.

I'm just

22

talking about the design of this.

I think it's

23

important for folks to know the developer is

24

taking all the risk not only during construction
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services

44

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - June 6, 2017

1

but post.

2

MR. BUDESCU:

Yes.

3

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

And they recoup some of

4

that with progress, but not all.

5

you know, the challenge here is going to be, you

6

know, sort of vetting either on a look through

7

basis or on an individual basis their ability to

8

complete and sort of withstand that, right?

9

MR. BUDESCU:

Yes.

And ultimately,

So we've -- the RFP

10

document is -- we asked for a lot, right.

11

want to make sure that the people we partner to

12

enter the design development phase and execute

13

this project will have the wherewithal both

14

financially to finance the project and get the

15

financing needed, but also to design and

16

construct the project on time and on budget.

17

We

And so we've asked a lot of the

18

respondents and I think we're confident that

19

we'll be able to get a really good partner that

20

can execute on all three prongs of that.

21

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

And the three sites, do

22

they all happen in parallel or is there a

23

staging?

24

MR. MARQUISOS:

It's generally in parallel,

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

45

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - June 6, 2017

1

but the main facility in Englewood is the

2

priority.

3

comments about the pitfalls associated with the

4

design build delivery method, I think that this

5

project is particularly well suited to this kind

6

of somewhat unique plan.

7

-- I don't want to minimize them, but they are

8

somewhat rudimentary, right.

9

buildings are going to win architectural awards,

And getting back to your earlier

Because these buildings

None of these

10

right.

They are rectangular boxes that contain a

11

repair facility.

12

level of complexity that sometimes design build

13

has a difficult time kind of adequately setting

14

expectation between the client and the developer.

15

So we're not talking about a

In this case I think with this

16

collaborative approach you will end up with a

17

design that we're all clear about what we're

18

getting and how much it should cost.

19

got a number of systems built in that is

20

competitive throughout.

21

And we have

So I'm very excited about this

22

project.

23

-- I'm thrilled that the trust is involved.

24

I think it's a great idea and I think

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

Just one thing and,

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

46

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - June 6, 2017

1

again, you guys are going to go and best

2

practices, you know, things to look out for.

3

thing and other folks may have had similar

4

experiences, but is I've seen sort of large

5

construction projects in the past that are design

6

build, not design build finance.

7

first.

8
9

One

This will be a

You know, I hear often from smaller
contractors, smaller participants in the chain,

10

minority women owned enterprises, that

11

consolidation of those functions and the timing

12

creates fewer opportunities for them to be

13

engaged in a project.

14

reality or not I don't know.

15

about the, you know, the narrative.

16

something that we should be mindful of certainly.

17

Not just in terms of like --

And so whether that's the

18

MR. MARQUISOS:

19

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

I'm just talking
And

Those concerns are real.
Yes, not just in terms of

20

what we are doing to address them, but I think

21

what everyone needs to be doing to communicate

22

why this, you know, why -- how we are addressing

23

it.

24

MS. DARLING:

So that's an excellent point.

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

47

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - June 6, 2017

1

And so I did want to talk quickly about our

2

participation and workforce goals.

3

have MBE/WBE goals of 28 and minority

4

participation and 8 percent women owned business

5

participation.

6

requirements.

7

construction work hours have to be performed by

8

City residents.

9

work hours must go to project area residents and

In the RFP we

That exceeds the City standards
50 percent of the total

15 percent of the construction

10

the City's standard requirement is 7-and-a-half

11

percent and this doubles that.

12

area includes the following neighborhoods;

13

Chatham, Englewood, Auburn Gresham, Washington

14

Heights, Greater Grand Crossing, Park Manor,

15

Avalon Park and Woodlawn.

16

And that project

The City and CIT are very committed to

17

making sure that these goals are met.

18

contractor is going to be required to hold two

19

job fairs to facilitate community outreach.

20

are currently as the CIT working to do outreach

21

to the minority business enterprise -- women

22

business enterprise business agencies to make

23

sure that we're spreading the word.

24

The

Patty and I recently attended the

We

City's Department of Procurement Services vendor

2

fair and I attempted to spread the word about the

3

project there.

4

agencies and provided information about the RFP

5

coming available.

6

We met with many of the assist

So to the extent that you all can

7

assist in spreading the word on that,

8

particularly I look to our Aldermanic members of

9

the board.

And but we wanted to make sure that

10

we are doing everything we can to spread the word

11

to make sure that there's an opportunity for as

12

much participation as possible.

13

MR. BUDESCU:

And the June 15 --

14

MS. DARLING:

Oh, yes, I was getting to

15
16

that.
CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

Just before you do that.

17

I want to just raise with Ralph and Jorge in

18

particular, you know, this 15 percent of total

19

construction hours going to project area

20

residents in those 8 neighborhoods.

21

important that is, but also I would imagine how

22

challenging that is.

23
24

How

And so I'm going to say some things on
your behalf that you don't have to say, but I
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

49

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - June 6, 2017

1

believe that that is more than a notion and

2

laudable that we are doing it.

3

recognize that there are 77 neighbors and we are

4

talking about 8 neighbors providing 15 percent of

5

the population -- 50 percent of the total

6

construction work hours.

But I also

7

And what I think is -- that is a

8

requirement that's on the developer, on the

9

contractor, right.

But I think it's one that if

10

we actually want to see it -- it's one thing to

11

put the number up there, but if we actually want

12

to see that number be met or exceeded, it's going

13

to require some help from friends like you.

14

And, you know, data about who do --

15

who in those neighborhoods are, you know, in the

16

trades and at what level, you know, apprentice,

17

journeymen, whatever in which trades.

18

I think having sources of that

19

information at least for this staff if not for

20

the winning bidder is going to be necessary to

21

make that requirement a reality.

22

know, understand; but I think it's just -- the

23

information who's there and how do we get to it

24

or address it vis-à-vis this particular job

You guys, you

2

opportunity.
MS. DARLING:

So we want to talk quickly,

3

you know, we sort of discussed the very

4

abbreviated timeline for this project, but really

5

the milestone that I want to make sure I draw

6

your immediate attention to is we are now having

7

a pre-submission and networking conference on

8

June 15th.

9

at the 7th District Police Station Community

This will be happening in Englewood

10

Room.

And we are working with 2FM on signing --

11

on that conference.

12

through our website currently.

13

have to RSVP to participate, but we request that

14

you do.

And we are accepting RSVP's
And you don't

15

And so that information is available.

16

And, again, we'll ask you and continue to spread

17

the word on that.

18

minority and women business owners have the

19

opportunity to network with some of the larger

20

builders who may be interested in the project and

21

be able to help them form some relationships and

22

have opportunities.

23

MR. SCOTT:

24

on the website.

We want to make sure that

Do you have a -- I know that's
Do you have a one sheet or a

2

of my minority vendors in 24.

3

24, 27, 28 who want to participate in projects

4

that happen in the 24th Ward.

5

to give that to me, I will be able to send that

MS. HUBBARD:

Yes, that would be helpful,

18

Leslie.

And then I just had one other question

19

or comment regarding this.

20

It would be nice and I don't know if

21

it's in the, you know, something that's already

22

being considered; but it would be great given the

23

work that's going to be done in these facilities

24

if there could also be some type of long-term job

1

training or apprenticeship programs or

2

certification programs that would help the people

3

in those communities have more permanent jobs on

repairing the buses and the other types of

5

vehicles that will be, you know, worked on in

6

those facilities.

7

that as part of the process or can be included in

8

9

in the project in general?

10

MS. DARLING:

Do you know of anything like

I know that there is a strong

11

commitment from the Mayor and the City to bring

12

jobs to Englewood.

13

we'll bring up with Fleet and Facility Management

14

and I will report back.

It's certainly something that

15

MS. HUBBARD:

All right.

16

MS. DARLING:

Any other questions on the

17

North and Throop?

18

MR. LINGENFELTER:

Thank you.

I would just say this is

19

a classic example of what this entity was created

20

to do.

21

use that as an incentive to get the private

22

sector to put skin in the game.

23

let the Mayor's words earlier this week speak for

24

themselves, but we are doing greatly.

1

MS. DARLING:

Thank you.

I want to briefly

2

share -- I think we're starting to get a little

3

limited on time, but I want to briefly share

4

three additional initiatives that we have been

5

working on in addition to home buyer's, smart

6

lighting and the relocation of the 2FM facility.

7

The first is the express rail to

8

O'Hare.

As you know in our strategic plan that

9

we talked about a year -- a little more than a

10

year ago, we talked about a goal for the CIT to

11

become a specialized resource in the community.

12

Recently the City and Mayor Emanuel

13

asked Bob Rivkin formerly of the U.S. Department

14

of Transportation and CTA prior to that, to lead

15

the development of the express rail to O'Hare

16

project.

17

working group to advise on financial and

18

procurement matters with many other people

19

involved from the City side.

20

sitting on those working groups.

21

to make sure you all were aware that -- of our

22

participation in that.

23
24

And CIT has been asked to sit on the

So Tom has been
And so I wanted

In addition, back in April the Mayor
announced that the City buildings will be powered
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

54

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - June 6, 2017

1

by 100 percent renewable energy by 2025.

And so

2

we have talked frequently as a board about a

3

possible Retrofit Two.

4

a bill in Springfield that has allowed some

5

incentives on electric generation including

6

solar.

And so the -- but there's

7

And we have been working with the

8

City's Chief Sustainability Officer to think

9

about how the City might generate some of its own

10

renewal power including solar.

So that's in

11

infant stages.

12

attended a few meetings and we have some more

13

scheduled, but we're really excited about the

14

possibility there.

15

what form it will take yet, but it's something

16

that we're involved in and the CIT has a seat at

17

the table.

18

provide some additional advice and services to

19

the City.

We are currently -- we have

We don't know what exactly --

So we are very excited to help

And then --

20

MS. BARRETT:

Quick interjection on that.

21

MS. DARLING:

Sure.

22

MS. BARRETT:

I noticed an article yesterday

23

in the Tribune I think it was the Blue Sky column

the economics of these energy alternative sources

have totally flipped.

3

time to look at this as an opportunity for the

4

City.

5

MS. DARLING:

And so that now is the

Yes, we are really excited

6

about it.

Then on a much smaller level, but we

7

also wanted to give you a quick update that we

8

have been asked to assist the City's Department

9

of Transportation on a project being led by the

10

Environmental Law and Policy Center of which Carl

11

Lingenfelter is also on that board as well to

12

provide some additional advice on the

13

refurbishment of the pedway.

14

And that's a project that they've been

asked to just provide some assistance.
CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

I just I think Jorge made

3

a great suggestion about an example of a follow

4

on opportunity that the Home Buyer's Assistance

5

Program creates and just in general as Carl said

6

this role that we have of being thoughtful about

7

financing opportunities, and so I suspect that

8

there will be more things like that that get

9

added to this pipeline where we can be a

10

financial conduit in some fashion.

11

And, you know, I would strongly

12

encourage us to continue to think about -- a lot

13

of the stuff I'm talking about is in the built

14

environment.

15

to think about the role that we play.

And then based on our very short time

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

Yes.

I think we have to

take public comment before we -MS. DARLING:

No, we can vote.

We should do

that first.
CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

Why don't we look at the
