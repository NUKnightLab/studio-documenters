RE: Parkview Limited Dividend Housing Association Limited Liability Company 
Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILOT)

MHT Housing, Inc. has formed Parkview Limited Dividend Housing Association
Limited Liability Company in order to develop the Project known as Parkview The
Project is an existing one hundred ninety-nine (199) senior units located in a single,
fifteen-story building in an area bounded by Antietam on the north, Chene on the east,
Lafayette on the south and St. Aubin on the west.

The rehabilitation Project will include one hundred seventy-one (171) 1 bedroom/1 bath
and twenty-eight (28) studio apartments of four hundred thirty-one (431) square feet
each. Twenty (20) units will be converted to meet ?Barrier Free? standards. Except for the
conversion ofthe Barrier Free units, no tenant will be displaced during the renovation.

A construction loan in the amount of $13,600,000 will be provided by JPMorgan Chase
Bank NA and a permanent mortgage loan in the amount of $5,551,578 will be provided
by Cinnaire Investment Corporation. City Real Estate Advisors, LLC will make Capital
Contributions of $11,584,163 which includes the purchase of Low Income Housing Tax
Credits. Additionally, the Sponsor has agreed to defer $708,020 ofthe developer fee.

Rents for all units have been set at or below sixty percent ofthe area median
income, adjusted for family size. Additionally, forty-two (42) units are covered by a Section
8 contract where rents are structured so that residents contribute only thirty percent
of their adjusted gross income minus a utility allowance towards the rent amount.
All one hundred ninety-nine (199) units will be subject to the PILOT based on Section 15a
ofthe State Housing Development Authority Act of 1966, as amended.

In order to make this development economically feasible, it is necessary for it to receive
the benefits of tax exemption under Section 15a ofthe State Housing Development
Authority Act of 1966 (PA 346 as amended, MCL 125.1415A). Adoption ofthe resolution
by your Honorable Body will therefore satisfy the requirements of Public Act 346 and City
Ordinance 9-90, as amended, by establishing a service charge of seven percent of the
annual net shelter rent obtained from this housing project.

RE: Request To Amend the Detroit Police Department?s Fiscal Year 2018-2019
Budget

Honorable City Council:

Pursuant to a September 20, 2018 joint directive of the Mayor and Chief of Police and resolution
of the Board of Police Commissioners, the Detroit Police Department (DPD) established its own
towing and storage operations. These operations will provide substantial bene?ts to the citizens
of the City of Detroit including:

0 Enhanced monitoring and oversight of the DPD towing activities.
0 Assistance via fee waivers for individuals that qualify.
I Potential excess revenues to support DPD towing and other DPD operational needs.

The Fiscal Year 2019-2020 budget restricts use of revenue from the towing and storage
operation consistent with the Resolution, and it is intended that future revenues from such
operations be likewise restricted. In order to ensure that all revenues from the towing and
storage operations are used exclusively for DPD purposes, we respectfully request authorization
to establish Appropriation 20599 Towing Operations in the Special Revenue Fund.

This appropriation will be used to capture all revenues generated by DPD operations including
all towing, storage and administrative fees. These revenues will be appropriated, restricted and
used exclusively to support the DPD towing and storage operations or other uses that directly
support public safety operations.

A waiver of reconsideration is requested.
Sincerely,

MEMORANDUM

TO: Lawrence Garcia, Law Department
Mr. Whittaker, Legislative Policy Division

CC: Honorable Colleagues

Louise Jones, Senior City Clerk
FROM: Council President Brenda JonesE)%?
DATE: May 7, 2019
RE: Income Tax Ordinance

 

The City of Detroit does not collect income taxes owed by Detroit residents that are employed
with businesses outside the city at the maximum rate. Therefore, the City of Detroit does not
capture crucial income tax dollars to support city operations, neighborhood investments, and
debt obligations. Therefore, the office of City Council President Brenda Jones requests that the
Law Department draft an ordinance implementing the following:

1. The establishment of an Income Tax Outreach coordinator to track, inform, and enhance
income tax collection for residents that are employed outside of the City of Detroit.

2. Requirements for quarterly updates on collection efforts and collection enhancement
strategies for residents that are employed outside of the City of Detroit.

3. The establishment, with the input of the City of Detroit Income Tax Division, of an
outreach strategy including but not limited to yearly mailings and outreach events to
encourage businesses outside of the City of Detroit to withhold income taxes from Detroit
residents and to enhance the collection of income taxes from Detroit residents that are
employed with businesses outside of the City.
