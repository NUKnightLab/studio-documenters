The Village of East Hazel Crest has identified that this commercial building and parking area has been
abandoned for more than a year and is currently blighted. With the recent road work improvements in
this area this property has been reduced and is deteriorating at a rate that makes it difficult to encourage
new development. The Village of East Hazel Crest would like to secure this property, make the necessary
improvements and remarket it in an effort to add to its business tax income. East Hazel Crest is a small
land locked community with a small business base. This particular property would benefit by the addition
of adjoining property (requested in a second No Cash Bid application) if it were combined to make a
more marketable site. It would assist the Village in maximizing the sales tax potential.
The Village of East Hazel Crest will file for and maintain tax exempt status for the requested property
until that time a developer is located.
There is no Third Party Request, proposal or agreement by a developer, organization or other private
party for this no-cash bid request.
The Village of East Hazel Crest will retain the legal services of Hiskes, Dillner, O'Donnell, Marovich &
Lapp, Ltd, attorneys for the Village, to obtain the tax deed and the Village will bear all legal and other
costs associated with acquisition of the parcel.
The Village of East Hazel Crest will also annually report to the Cook County Department of Economic

This request package contains one (1) PIN.
The property is a swath of green space that is situated in the heart of the City of Rolling Meadows’
downtown area. The property is sandwiched between the Rolling Meadows Shopping Center and Salt
Creek and leads directly into Kimball Hill Park to the north. The property was originally platted and
designated for storm water detention for the development of the shopping center. A large majority of this

Consequently, this parcel is land-locked, inaccessible and undevelopable and will remain green, open
space. It is anticipated that the parcel will remain City property whether it be retained by the City of
Rolling Meadows or be conveyed to the Rolling Meadows Park District. The parcel itself will remain and
be maintained as green space and added to the Salt Creek green belt that traverses through the heart of the
City of Rolling Meadows.
The City of Rolling Meadows will file for tax exempt status for this property while the City retains the
property or the Park District when and if it is conveyed the property.
The City of Rolling Meadows will use its legal counsel to obtain the tax deed and bear all legal and other
costs associated with acquisition of the parcel.
The City of Rolling Meadows agrees to submit, to the Cook County Department of Economic
Development, No Cash Bid Reports on the status of the parcel for five (5) years as required by the Cook

RESOLUTION
A RESOLUTION IN OPPOSITION TO THE USE OF THE AREA KNOWN AS THE
LUCAS BERG NATURE PRESERVE FOR THE DUMPING OF DREDGED SEDIMENTARY
MATERIALS FROM THE CAL-SAG CHANNEL AND CALLING FOR THE
UNITED STATES ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS TO FIND AN ALTERNATIVE SITE
WHEREAS, the area now known as the Lucas Berg Nature Preserve located in the Village of Worth was
designed in the late 1970s and completed in the early 1980s by the United States Army Corps of
Engineers (USACE) and named the Lucas-Berg Confined Dredged Material Disposal Facility (CDF) for
the disposal of maintenance dredging material from the Calumet-Sag Channel. It is owned by the
Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago and leased to USACE. The Metropolitan
Walter Reclamation District of Greater Chicago (MWRD) transferred the property to USACE until such
time that the Corps determines that the land is no longer suitable for use in connection with the Cal-Sag
dredging project and transfers it back to MWRD; and
WHEREAS, the Lucas-Berg CDF, also referred to as the Lucas-Berg Pit, is located in a 74 acre former
tract located north of the Calumet-Sag Channel, between Southwest Highway on the west, Oketo Avenue
on the east and 111th Street on the north; and
WHEREAS, the neighborhood surrounding the Lucas-Berg Pit is densely populated and consists of
homes, schools, churches, public transportation, food establishments, and housing for the elderly; and
WHEREAS, the dumping of dredged sedimentary materials into the Lucas-Berg Pit would settle in
proximity to ground water and pose a potential hazard to the air and drinking water of the community;
and
WHEREAS, the Army Corps of Engineers’ environmental assessment study of the Cal-Sag Channel
dredgings identifies the existence of potentially hazardous pollutants which pose a threat to the Village of
Worth and its residents and could cause serious illness including mercury poisoning, lead poisoning,
anemia, brain damage, birth defects, kidney dysfunction, and lung impairments; and
WHEREAS, the Illinois House of Representatives adopted HR0655 on January 13, 2010 which states
opposition to the use of the Lucas-Berg CDF and the dumping of dredged sedimentary materials into the
Lucas-Berg Pit because of the threat to human life and safety in the surrounding area and urges the
USACE to find an alternative and safe resting site for sediments dredged from the Cal-Sag Channel; and

WHEREAS, Worth residents successfully opposed a plan to turn the preserve into a landfill in the 1970s
and in response to their concerns in 2005 regarding the USACE plan to dump toxic dredged sediments
from the Cal-Sag Channel, the Worth Village Board formed the Life Safety Commission and the Lucas
Berg Nature Preserve Commission, so that the area known as the Lucas-Berg Nature Preserve would
remain dedicated to recreation and nature for the life safety and environmental sustainability of the
surrounding community and also in order to protect the fragile ecosystem and flaura and fauna that has
developed in the preserve for the last thirty years.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and Board of Cook County
Commissioners do hereby oppose the use of the Lucas-Berg Pit as a repository for contaminated dredge
material from the Cal-Sag project and insist on its removal from the USACE list of placement property
and call upon USACE to find an alternative site; and

CHANGE ORDERS
ITEM #49
APPROVED
COMMISSIONER PERAICA VOTED "NO".
Transmitting a Communication, dated June 30, 2010 from
BRUCE WASHINGTON, Director, Office of Capital Planning and Policy
transmitted herewith for your approval is Change Order No. 1 in the amount of $281,286.00 to the
contract with Tilton, Kelly & Bell, L.L.C., Chicago, Illinois, for the Design and Construction
Administration Services Project at Hawthorne Warehouse. It is respectfully requested that this Honorable
Body approve this request.
Reason:

This change order provides for additional architectural and engineering services associated
with the increase in the project budget. The budget was increased during the 2010 Capital
Improvement Program (CIP) process to meet the need for additional program requirements,
expanded construction scope and specialized shelving equipment. In addition, floor loading
analyses were required, structural engineering and the need for customized environmental
control systems necessary to accommodate the storage of sensitive records.
The original project scope developed did not anticipate the density of storage systems
required to meet the requirements obtained through programming. The additional amount
added to their contract represents a 1.95% increase of the revised project amount, far
below industry standards.

TRANSFER OF FUNDS
ITEM #67
APPROVED
Transmitting a Communication, dated July 6, 2010 from
DOROTHY A. BROWN, Clerk of the Circuit Court
requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners to transfer funds totaling $89,000.50 from and to the
accounts listed below, for the procurement of two (2) trucks that were previously approved by the Board
of Commissioners during FY 2010 Capital Equipment Budget approval, and to pay for seven (7) Digital
Microfilm scanners purchased on November 16, 2009.
Reason:

Additional funds are needed to purchase the previously approved trucks. The original
estimated cost of $85,000.00 was for gasoline engine trucks, however, upon further review of
the dimensions and specifications we realized that the trucks are much smaller and do not
provide access to a standard dock. As a result, we are reverting to purchasing the trucks that
meet our needs and replacing the current ones with high mileage and high maintenance cost.
Also, funds for the purchase of the seven (7) scanners were budgeted in FY 2008 in Capital
Account 579. Contrary to the submitted requisition, Purchase Order #165040 was issued
from Operating Account 530.
Upon submitting the invoices for payment (last invoice received May 10, 2010).
requests for payments were denied for lack of funds.

The

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
As to the two (2) trucks, on May 13, 2010 it became apparent that the receiving account would
require an infusion of funds in order to meet current obligations. At that time, the balance in the
account was $85,000.00 and 30 days prior to that it was $85,000.00.
As to the seven Digital Microfilm scanners, on May 20, 2010 it became apparent that the receiving
account would require an infusion of funds in order to meet current obligations. At that time, the
balance in the account was $495.00 and 30 days prior to that it was $495.00.

2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
Account 521-Institutional Equipment was identified as the source of the transferred funds as the
account was budgeted for the purchase of various equipment that will be needed for the moving of
the Record Center from 2323 South Rockwell to the Hawthorne Warehouse, which is no longer
anticipated to take place in FY 2010, hence, the availability of funds for transfer.
Account 530-Office Furniture and Equipment was identified as the source of the transferred funds
as the account was budgeted for the purchase of a Planetary Camera and Scanner that will no longer
be purchased, as the model is being phased out. Instead, the idea of outsourcing the specialized
scanning project is being considered, hence, the availability of funds for transfer.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from 529-521 and 529-530.
None.

4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
Account 521-Institutional Equipment was budgeted for the purchase of various equipment that will
be needed for the moving of the Record Center from 2323 South Rockwell to the Hawthorne
Warehouse. The move to the Hawthorne Warehouse is currently behind schedule due to funding
issues encountered by the Office of Capital Planning and Policy. Hence, the availability of funds
for transfer in FY 2010. However, we will be requesting funds in FY 2011 to complete the move to
the Hawthorne Warehouse.
Account 530-Office Furniture and Equipment was budgeted for the purchase of a Planetary Camera
and Scanner that will no longer be purchased, as the model is being phased out. Instead, the idea of
outsourcing the specialized scanning project is being considered, hence, the availability of funds for
transfer.

OFFICE OF THE STATE'S ATTORNEY
GRANT AWARD RENEWAL
ITEM #70
APPROVED
Transmitting a Communication, dated July 9, 2010 from
ANITA ALVAREZ, Cook County State’s Attorney
by
MICHELE V. LATZ, Chief of the Administrative Services Bureau, State’s Attorney’s Office
requesting authorization to renew a grant in the amount of $38,709.00 from the Illinois Department of
Children and Family Services (IDCFS). This grant will provide continued partial funding for our Child
Sexual Abuse Specialist Program that is jointly funded by the Illinois Attorney General’s Office. The
one, full-time Child Sexual Abuse Specialist funded by this grant focuses on providing victim services
including crisis intervention with victims and families of victims, identifying and making referrals for
immediate and long-term counseling services, monitoring and coordinating services for children who are
wards of the state and working with the local and state agencies involved with the victim as well as
working directly with local and state law enforcement and service agencies to provide training, technical
assistance and consultation.
The estimated fiscal impact is the remaining salary and fringe benefits of the Child Sexual Abuse
Specialist that would not be covered by the anticipated grant awards from the Illinois Attorney General’s

CONTRACT continued
ITEM #71 cont’d
Reason:

These vendors are grant partners for the Project Reclaim grant approved by the Illinois
Criminal Justice Information Authority (ICJIA) and by this Board. Each specific vendor, with
their unique skills and resources, will be able to provide all necessary resources to ensure all
grant goals are met. These goals are obtained by maintaining interagency information sharing
that tracks juvenile needs and services. Accountability-based programs will provide court
advocacy services, gang intervention, mentoring programs, English classes, youth support
groups, after school and summer youth programs, improved academic performance and
positive decision-making skills. Restorative justice programs will provide peer jury and peer
mediation, family group conferencing programs, viable alternatives to court prosecution and
conflict resolution for first time or early juvenile offenders, victim/offender conferencing, and
peace-making circles, all of which lead to the reduction of recidivism. Partners will also
provide risk and needs assessment, intensive one-on-one mentoring services,
counseling/therapy in individual, group and family modalities, and referrals to other mental
health and substance abuse providers. The State’s Attorney’s Office has identified areas in
need of services across Cook County by evaluating police and Juvenile Justice Enterprise
Management System (GEMS) reports as well as reports generated through computer mapping
of juvenile crime, and has identified these uniquely qualified partners in each of the areas.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: None. Grant funded amount: $330,000.00. Contract period: November 27,
2009 through November 26, 2010. (833-260 Account).
