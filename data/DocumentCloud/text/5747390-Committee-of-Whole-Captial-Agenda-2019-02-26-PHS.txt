Marathon Variance Public Hearing

Marathon Petroleum Corporation has recently submitted a request for a variance from numerous

require]

nents of Bulk Solid Materials (?Fugitive Dust?) Ordinance, including the following:
Requirement that Marathon store, handle, and process petroleum coke in a fully enclosed
structure

Requirement that Marathon conduct a street sweeping program in compliance with the
Ordinance

Requirement that Marathon install a rumble strip for outgoing trucks to limit the track out of
dust onto roadways

Requirement to conduct visual emissions observations

BSEED held a public hearing on the variance on January 23rd, but proper notice had not been
provided to the public. Specifically, Marathon?s variance application had not been shared for the
public to review, and BSEED had not published the notice on the City website. I appreciate
efforts to meet the requirements of the ordinance through eventual posting of the variance

request

materials online and extension of the public comment period through March 18, 2019.

However, in order to fully comply with the ordinance and allow for robust community input, I
request that BSEED hold an additional public hearing on the variance request.

Please do not hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions. Thank you.

DATE: February 19, 2019
RE: Historic Virginia Park Street Repair Grant

 

Our of?ce has been working closely with the Virginia Park Block Club to address poor
road conditions on their brick pavement. Residents have been organizing their efforts
around securing funding to remove and replace brick pavement between the Lodge
Service Drive and Woodward Ave. The Department of Public Works provided residents
with an estimated total of $1.6 to $2.1 million dollars for removal and replacements of

brick pavement including concrete base.

Residents have identi?ed a possible funding opportunity through the Transportation
Alternatives Program (TAP) which is administered by the Michigan Department of
Transportation. This communication is to request the Of?ce of Grants Management to
take necessary steps to secure this grant and other possible funding opportunities.

Should you have any questions please contact my of?ce.
