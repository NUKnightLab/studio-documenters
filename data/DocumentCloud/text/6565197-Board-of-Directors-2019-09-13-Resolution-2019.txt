RESOLUTION 2019-041
CODE OF REGULATIONS AMENDMENT:
NOACA BOARD MEMBERSHIP BY POPULATION
NOACA Board of Directors
September 13, 2019

5-13

 ACTION REQUESTED
Request that the Board of Directors adopt the following
Resolution:
• Resolution 2019-041, which amends Article IV of the NOACA Code of
Regulations with regard to Board of Directors membership.

PREVIOUS ACTION
• This action was recommended by the Governance Committee in
August 2019

5-13

 BACKGROUND
• At its May meeting, the Governance Committee discussed an
inconsistency in the NOACA Code of Regulations.
• The Code of Regulations states that the region’s citizens should
be represented on the Board in a manner approximating equal
representation by population.
• Due to a 2009 math error, the Code also provides a list of
members by position or title that is inconsistent with the equal
representation requirement.
• In addition, NOACA has a longstanding practice of having each
county represented by a minimum of three Board members, but
this was never formalized in the Code of Regulations

5-13

 BACKGROUND
• The Board had previously approved an amendment to
the Code of Regulations addressing these issues, but
not all five counties ratified it.
• It was the consensus of the Board and Governance
Committee not to pursue the matter further until the
2020 Census provided a more opportune time to resolve
the issue.

5-13

 BACKGROUND
The Governance Committee specifically recommended:
• Mandating a minimum of three Board members per county.
• Adding two Board seats, to be distributed according to the
2020 Census results, in order to correct the math error.
• Adopting a formula to appropriately adjust Board membership
each decade according to Census data.
• Making these changes effective when results are released
from the 2020 Census.

 FINANCIAL IMPACT

There is no financial impact.

 

NEXT STEPS
Pending Board approval, staff will distribute this
amendment to Section 4.2 of the Code of Regulations to
the five counties for ratification prior to January 1, 2020.

5-13

 ACTION
Approval of Resolution 2019-041, which amends Article IV
of the NOACA Code of Regulations relative to Board of
Directors membership.
