Re: Opinion concerning banking issues

We understand that you have requested our opinion concerning efforts by the
OCFO to establish relationships with certain ?nancial institutions. This question
implicates two separate issues.

1. investment of surplus funds in accordance with PA 20.

In May 2018, City Council, acting pursuant to Michigan P.A. 20 of 1943
(MCL 129.91, et. seq), adopted a resolution approving CFO Directive NO. 2018?
101-008 titled ?Investment and Investment Management.? Section 6.6 of the
Directive authorizes the CFO to approve a list of quali?ed financial institutions into
which the City?s surplus funds may be invested. Such investments are strictly
regulated by PA. 20. The Treasurer may proceed under that Directive and PA. 20
to invest surplus funds with financial institutions approved by the CFO.

2. RFP initiative to enter Operating agreements with financial
institutions under PA 40.

We are aware that the OCFO has engaged in an RFP process to enter into
operating agreements with certain financial institutions. On September 17, 2018
the OCFO submitted a resolution to City Council to designate a number of financial
institutions to be depositories of funds of the City of Detroit in a proportion and
manner determined by the CFO. The purpose of this resolution is to comply with
Michigan P.A. 40 of 1932, titled Depositories of Public Moneys, under which City
Council designates financial institutions for deposits of public moneys. MCL
129.12.

Those operating agreements will be subject to City Council approval in
saccordance with applicable Charter provisions and ordinances. It would be
appropriate for City Council to make the PA 40 designations either prior to, or at the
{same time as, it approves the operating agreements.

RE:

Equalization Credit for Detroit-Based and Detroit Headquartered Businesses

President Pro Tern Mary Shef?eld has requested the Legislative Policy Division to report

on the use of equalization points for Detroit-based businesses, and Detroit Headquartered
businesses in the award of city contracts.

Section 18-5-12 of the Detroit City Code explains the process for solicitation of bids,

comparison of equalization credits in bids and the application of equalization credits for bids.
The equalization credit to Detroit ?based business is based on the contract cost.

 

Contract Amount Equalization Percentage
Up to $10,000.00 5%
$10,000.01 to $100,000.00 4%
$100,000.01 to $500,000.00 3%
$500,000.01 and over 2%

A business determined to be a Detroit-Resident business [business with at least 4 employees,
51% or more are Detroit residents] is eligible to receive the same equalization credit as the

Detroit?based business. The equalization percentage is doubled for a business determined to be
both Detroit-based and Detroit-resident.

The Honorable City Council

Equalization Credit for Detroit-Based and Detroit Headquartered Businesses
September 25, 2018

Page 3

The application of the Executive Orders to the evaluation and scoring of proposals, for
professional services contracts, has remained the same, beginning with Mayor Archer?s
Executive Order No. 4 in 1994. Equalization credits correspond to points in the Requests for
Proposals. Points are awarded for both the prime contractor and subcontractor certi?cation.
Scoring is based on 100 total points. The credit or points, up to a total of 35 points, are given in
addition to the points awarded for cost, experience, quali?cations, etc.

Credit to the prime contractor, certi?ed as a Detroit-headquartered business is 10 points;
credit as Detroit-based business is 5 points. Proposals that includes sub-contractor(s) that are
Detroit-headquartered businesses may receive up to 15 points. A proposal that includes sub-
contractors certi?ed as Detroit-based may receive up to 5 points.

Certi?cation as a Detroit-headquartered business provides signi?cant advantage, over a
Detroit-based certi?cation only, both in award of contracts to the Lowest cost bid, and the
evaluation of proposals for a professional service contract.
