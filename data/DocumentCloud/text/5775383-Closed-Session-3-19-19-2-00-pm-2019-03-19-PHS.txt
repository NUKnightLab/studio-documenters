Report on Bringing all Demolition Administrative Activities Back to

the City of Detroit to be Subject to City Council Approval and/or

Oversight

The Legislative Policy Division (LPD) has received requests from Council President, Brenda
Jones and Council President Pro-Tempore, Mary Shef?eld to provide a report with regard to

bringing the demolition activities back to the City of Detroit.

The public demolition acitivies in Detroit are primarily conducted by the City of Detroit (City)
and the Detroit Land Bank Authority (DLBA). The City demolition activities are primarily
?mded by the City?s general fund, Community DeveIOpment Block Grant (CDBG) dollars and
Fire Insuarance Escrow dollars. The DLBA demolition activities are generally funded by U.S.
Treasury Hardest Hit Fund (HHF) dollars. The City?s demolition activties are managed by the
Detroit Building Authority (DBA) pursuant to a demolition management contract between the

City and the DBA.

The CityiDBA Demolition Management Agreement was entered into on August 11, 2015.
Pursuant to Section 10 of the agreement the initial term was for two years with an automatic
extension of an additional two years if neither party provides a ?Notice of Termination?. There

was no Notice of Termination provided prior to August 1 l, 2017, the term of the Agreement was
therefore extended until August 11, 2019.I Pursuant to the language of the Agreement, the term

 

Section 10 of the Agreement provides that the extended term will terminate in two years unless the parties by joint
action terminate the agreement prior to that date by giving written notice of termination to the other Party, at least 30
days before the alternative date of termination. The Agreement could have also been terminated by either party in

will expire on August 11, 2019 unless renewed in writing by the Parties. If the agreement is
renewed it would have to come before City Council for approval. If it id not renewed, the
management of demolition acitivity conducted on behalf of the City by the DBA will return to
the City for management.

The DLBA demolition activties are a different matter. The U.S. Treasury requires the HHF
dollars be distributed pursuant to a Participation Agreement between the U.S. Treasury and the
Michigan State Housing Development Authority (MSHDA), the state ?Housing Finance
Agency? under the Agreement and the Michigan Homeowner Assistance Nonpro?t Housing
Corporation (MHA), the Eligible Entity" under the Agreement.2 Under the Participation
Agreement?s ?Blight Elimination Program? selects a partner that is responsible
for property acquisition,3 demolition work and on-going property maintenance. The partner
selected by to receive and conduct the blight elimination project for Detroit is the
DLBA. The DLBA utilizes the DBA to manage its demolition program under a demotion
management agreement. The Term of the DLBA Demolition Management Agreement began on
February 2, 2015 and shall expire when terminated by either party with written notice of
termination thirty (30) days before the effective date of termination.

As stated the HHF dollars are provided by the U.S. Treasury to be distributed to the eligible
entity of the The has selected the DLBA (a separate legal entity)
as their partner to receive the HHF dollars to carry out the blight elimination project. Under this
construct, the City cannot remove the demolition actitives from the DLBA and bring those
activities under direct City control. However, once the HHF dollars have been expended, the
demolition activities of the DLBA will not be subject to the terms of the U.S. Treasury
Participation Agreement. At that time all demolition activities of the City can be conducted
under the management of the City, subject to City Council approval and/or oversight.4

If we can be of ?lrther assistance, please call upon us.

 

whole or in part, after giving Notice of Termination to the orther Party at least one (1) year before the Termination
Date. Since there is only a few months remaining in the extended term this latter provision is not applicable.

3 The Participation Agreement is a three party agreement between the U.S. Treasury, MSHDA a public body
corporate and politic of the State of Michigan) as the states ?Housing Financing Authority? and the MHA (a
domestic non-pro?t corporation) as the ?Eligible Entity?. Under the Agreement the MSHDA has designated MHA
as the ?nancial institution to receive tha HHF Program funds and to act to implement the Services outlined in the
Agreement. Under the Blight Elimination Program, MSHDA and MHA selected the DLBA as the partner to
exercise the mortgage and note for a maximum of $25,000 in favor of the MHA for the demolition of each quali?ed
property to be demolished.

3 Under the Participation Agreement the partner (DLBA) must have title to each demolition candidate prior to
receipt of HHF dollars. The acquisition of properties, included but are not limited to the DLBA receiving properties
from the City?s Planning Development Department as well as properties received from the Wayne
County Treasury (foreclosed preperties after the City?s exercise of its right of ?rst refusal.

After the HHF dollars have been expended, any demolition activity conducted by the DLBA would most likely be
?inded by the City. The City could request the DLBA terminate its demolition management agreement with the
DBA and the management of any DLBA demolition activity could be operated by the City through the Building
Safety, Engineering and Environmetal Department (BSEED).

RE: Report on Bonding Insurance for City of Detroit Demolition Contractors

The Legislative Policy Division (LPD) has been requested by Council President Brenda Jones to
provide a report on a process to provide a 90-day revocable bonding insurance for contractors
that wish to bid on City of Detroit demolition contracts. In addition, LPD has been requested to
prepare a resolution urging a change in Michigan law to allow for 90-day revocable bonding.

The bonding insurance relative to the contractors who bid on demolition contracts would be in the
form of a performance bond.l The State of Michigan requires that contractors who receive public
construction contracts over $50,000 are required to have performance bonds. Public Act 213 of
1963, Contractor?s Bond for Public Buildings Works, MCL 129.201, provides in pertinent part:

Before any contract, exceeding $50,000.00 for the construction, alteration, or repair
of any public building or public work or improvement of the state or a county, city,
village, township, school district, public educational institution, other political
subdivision, public authority, or public agency hereinafter referred to as the
?governmental unit?, is awarded, the proposed contractor, hereinafter referred to as
the ?principal contractor?, shall ?lrnish at his or her own cost to the governmental
unit a performance bond and a payment bond which shall become binding upon the

 

1 According to the Business Dictionary a performance bond is: A written guaranty from a third party guarantor
(usually a bank or an insurance company) submitted to a principal (client or customer) by a contractor on winning
the bid. A performance bond ensures payment of a sum (not exceeding a stated maximum) of money in case the
contractor fails in the full performance of the contract. Performance bonds usually cover 100 percent of the contract
price and replace the bid bonds on award of the contract. 



award of the contract to the principal contractor.

The State requirement of a performance bond and payment bond for public construction contracts
over $50,000 allows for the governmental unit2 to set the amount necessary under the contract but
no less than 25% of the total contract amount as set forth under MCL 129.202 which states:

The performance bond shall be in an amount ?xed by the governmental unit but
not less than 25% of the contract amount, conditioned upon the faith?il
performance of the contract in accordance with the plans, speci?cations and terms
thereof. The bond shall be solely for the protection of the governmental unit
awarding the contract.

As provided by law, the City of Detroit (City) demolition contractors who receive a contract over
$50,000 must provide a performance bond and payment bond that is no less than 2 of the
contract amount. The law does not provide for the allowance of a 90-day revocable insurance bond,
but does provide that the bond shall be solely for the protection of the City. This requirement is
not unusual. The Federal government requires performance and payment bonds on public
construction contracts over $100,000 under 40 US. Code 313] - Bonds of contractors of public
buildings or works.3

The general purpose of the performance bonds is the protection of public tax dollars that are being
expended on the public construction project, in this instance City demolitions. The use of
performance bonds is required, however, according to the state law the amount of the requisite
performance bond is no less than 25% of the contract amount. If the City is requiring more than
25% of the contract amount on performance bonds, there may be a need for the City to re-evaluate
whether the amount of the performance bond above 25% on City construction contracts is
necessary. Is there room for a reduction in the amount of the performance bond required on City
demolition contracts?

In addition to the required insurance in the form of a performance bond, the City also requires a
certain amount of liability insurance on all demolition contracts. This liability insurance is
necessary to protect the City from any claims that may result from injuries or accidents to persons
or property caused by the contractor in connection with completing the contract. However, the
combination of the two required types of insurance may be placing a heavy burden on smaller
contractors, resulting in their inability to compete and bid on contracts. The City may wish to

 

3 As set forth under the Act, the term governmental unit includes a ?public authority? and would include the Detroit
Land Bank Authority.

3 40 US. Code 3131(b) Type ofBonds Required. Before any contract of more than $100,000 is awarded for the
construction, alteration, or repair of any public building or public work of the Federal Government, a person must
?rmish to the Government the following bonds, which become binding when the contract is awarded:
(?Performance bond. A performance bond with a surety satisfactory to the of?cer awarding the contract, and in an
amount the of?cer considers adequate, for the protection of the Government. (2)Payment bond. A payment bond
with a surety satisfactory to the of?cer for the protection of all persons supplying labor and material in carrying out
the work provided for in the contract for the use of each person. The amount of the payment bond shall equal the
total amount payable by the terms of the contract unless the of?cer awarding the contract determines, in a writing
supported by speci?c ?ndings, that a payment bond in that amount is impractical, in which case the contracting
of?cer shall set the amount of the payment bond. The amount of the payment bond shall not be less than the amount
of the performance bond.

review its insurance requirements to determine if the amount of liability insurance necessary to
protect the City is what is being required.

If the types and amount of insurance being requested is necessary to protect the City and the
taxpayers, the smaller contractors may need to come up with other ways to meet those
requirements. Some smaller contractors have acted as subcontractors to larger contractors who
have the resources to meet the requirements. Another possibility is for smaller contractors to enter
into joint ventures?. While under a joint venture the contractors would have to share the pro?ts and
losses, they also share the cost associated with the project.

As stated earlier the bonding insurance is required by law on public construction contracts over

$50,000. Unless the law is changed the requirement to have a performance bond and payment bond
on the City?s demolition construction contracts will be required as set forth under the Act.

If we can be of further assistance, please call upon us.

 

A joint venture is a contractual business undertaking between two or more parties. It is similar to a business
partnership, with one key difference: a partnership generally involves an ongoing, long-term business relationship,
whereas a joint venture is based on a single business transaction.
