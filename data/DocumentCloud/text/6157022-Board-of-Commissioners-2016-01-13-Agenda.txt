PROPOSED RESOLUTION
CALLING ON THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO EXPAND ITS PATTERNS AND
PRACTICES INVESTIGATION OF THE CHICAGO POLICE DEPARTMENT TO INCLUDE
THE CHICAGO POLICE DETENTION FACILITY KNOWN AS HOMAN SQUARE
WHEREAS, Cook County is responsible for the administration of the Cook County Circuit Court, the
Cook County Jail, and, as a unit of government, bears a share of responsibility for protecting the health,
welfare and safety of the general public; and,
WHEREAS, the action undertaken by the City of Chicago this past November to make public the
dashboard camera video depicting the police shooting of Laquan McDonald, and the subsequent public
outcry has resulted in the United States Department of Justice moving swiftly to initiate a “patterns and
practices” investigation into the Chicago Police Department; and,
WHEREAS, stakeholders throughout Chicagoland, including Mayor Rahm Emanuel, have stated that
the current Justice Department investigation provides a clear opportunity to comprehensively reform
police-community relations; and,
WHEREAS, in the interests of comprehensive reform of police-community relations, the
aforementioned Justice Department investigation should be as wide-ranging as possible; and,
Page 5 of 42

 Board of Commissioners

BOARD AGENDA

January 13, 2016

WHEREAS, throughout 2015, and into 2016, questions have arisen in the community, and in the local,
national and international media, around the Chicago Police Department detention facility known as
Homan Square; and,
WHEREAS, the tactics and practices allegedly employed by special units of the Chicago Police
Department at Homan Square include failing to enter arrestees into official police databases; physical
abuse of detainees, resulting in serious injury and abuse to detainees; prolonged, uninterrupted shackling
of detainees; denial of attorney access to detainees; and, holding detainees for up to 24 hours without
access to a lawyer; and,
WHEREAS, the alleged tactics and practices at Homan Square, if true, pose serious concerns with
respect to the human rights of Cook County residents who live within the vicinity of the facility; and,
WHEREAS, allegations of torture, denial of counsel and off-the-books detentions raise serious
questions of human and constitutional rights violations; and,
WHEREAS, such questions are squarely within the purview of the United States Department of Justice
and its Civil Rights Division; and,
WHEREAS, any federal investigation of the Chicago Police Department that does not include Homan
Square will be incomplete and woefully inadequate;
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the President and the Board of Commissioners of Cook
County that the United States Department of Justice is hereby requested to expand its current “patterns
and practices” investigation to look into allegations of civil and human rights violations at the Chicago
Police detention facility known as Homan Square; and,
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that a copy of this resolution be sent at the earliest opportunity to the
Honorable Loretta E. Lynch, Attorney General of the United States.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
A RESOLUTION OF THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS CALLING ON GOVERNOR BRUCE
RAUNER TO REQUIRE THE APPOINTMENT OF A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR IN ALL CASES
INVOLVING POLICE SHOOTINGS OF UNARMED CIVILIANS IN THE STATE OF ILLINOIS
WHEREAS, in the summer of 2015, Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York issued an executive order
requiring the appointment of a Special Prosecutor for all cases involving police shootings of unarmed
civilians, and in so doing, stated, “A criminal justice system doesn’t work without trust”; and,
WHEREAS, in Chicago and Cook County, trust in law enforcement and the impartiality of the criminal
justice system has been significantly eroded by a series of police shootings of unarmed civilians; and,
Page 6 of 42

 Board of Commissioners

BOARD AGENDA

January 13, 2016

WHEREAS, it is a common practice of the Cook County State’s Attorney, as codified in the Cook
County Code of Ordinances, to work cooperatively with and rely upon the Chicago Police Department to
investigate, gather evidence, and build cases against criminal defendants; and,
WHEREAS, in Cook County, Assistant State’s Attorneys frequently rely upon police officers as
witnesses at trial, and the success of many prosecutions by the Cook County State’s Attorney hinges
upon police officer testimony; and,
WHEREAS, the Cook County State’s Attorney, as is the case with prosecutors throughout the State of
Illinois, is dependent upon the cooperation of police officers in order to fulfill the basic functions of the
office; and,
WHEREAS, the dependence of the Cook County State’s Attorney’s office upon the Chicago Police
Department in order to conduct its basic functions raises legitimate and pervasive concerns about the
ability of the State’s Attorney to be objective when weighing the potential prosecution of a Chicago
Police Officer; and,
WHEREAS, concerns about prosecutorial objectivity are especially problematic when it comes to cases
involving police shootings of unarmed civilians; and,
WHEREAS, a critical step in restoring trust in Cook County’s criminal justice system is to ensure
prosecutorial objectivity in cases involving police shootings of unarmed civilians; and,
WHEREAS, the example provided by Governor Cuomo in the State of New York demonstrates that,
while comprehensive reform of community-law enforcement relations will take time, there are simple
steps that can be taken in the short term to restore public faith in Cook County’s criminal justice system;
and,
WHEREAS, one such simple step would be the issuance of an executive order by the Governor of
Illinois to require a special prosecutor in all cases involving the shooting of unarmed civilians by police
officers;
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and the Board of Commissioners of Cook
County hereby call upon Governor Bruce Rauner to require the appointment of a Special Prosecutor in all
cases involving police shootings of unarmed civilians in the State of Illinois; and,
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that a copy of this resolution be sent by this body at the earliest
opportunity to the Honorable Bruce Rauner, Governor of the State of Illinois.

The Chief Procurement Officer concurs.
Summary: This proposed amendment exercises the second year renewal option available in the Cook
County contract with Alliance Against Intoxicated Motorists (AAIM) to coordinate Victim Impact Panel
sessions for traffic offenders, who participate by orders of the court. AAIM conducts 55 panel sessions
per year in court facilities in the First Municipal District in Chicago, the Second Municipal District in
Skokie, the Third Municipal District in Rolling Meadows, and the Sixth Municipal District in Markham.
Victim Impact Panels are an important element of the Circuit Court’s referral program that seeks to
reduce instances of driving under the influence (DUI). The panels consist of victims and past offenders
who were involved in alcohol or drug related accidents who relate their experiences before groups of
DUI offenders. AAIM, along with Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD), has been providing such
services on behalf of the court since 1991.
This is a Sole Source Procurement pursuant to Section 34-139 of the Cook County Procurement Code.
