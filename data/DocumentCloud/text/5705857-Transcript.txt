·1· · · · MR. SMITH:· Right.· Thanks.· I will keep it
·2· mercifully brief and talk fast, as I know I already
·3· do.
·4· · · · · · · · ·So the project for board
·5· consideration today is UCAN'S program services
·6· administrative headquarters building.
·7· · · · · · · · ·This is a North Lawndale project at
·8· Fillmore Street and Central Park Avenue, a 31,000
·9· square foot facility that would basically have two
10· functions:· UCAN's administrative headquarters,
11· and then also programming space primarily for their
12· 360 youth initiatives focusing on youth violence,
13· prevention, counseling, and assisting youth that
14· have experienced trauma.
15· · · · · · · · ·UCAN stands for Uhlich Children's
16· Advantage Network.· It's a 501(c)(3) based in
17· Chicago that's been around since the 1800s.· Its
18· mission has adapted over time, but it basically
19· has been serving orphaned children throughout its
20· entire existence.
21· · · · · · · · ·At this point, it's a major operator
22· of both residential programs and support programs
23· for wards of the state.
24· · · · · · · · ·The organization has seven locations.

 · MEETING, 01/14/2015
Page 5

·1· The flagship location is in the 3700 block of North
·2· California in the Irving Park neighborhood.· That's
·3· an outmoded, overcrowded facility that they are
·4· in the process of selling.· They actually have a
·5· contract already for the entire site to be sold,
·6· and relocating to this new Lawndale facility.
·7· · · · · · · · ·So here's a bit more context on the
·8· location.· It's between Independence and Central
·9· Park along the Fillmore Street right-of-way, which
10· has already been vacated by the City.
11· · · · · · · · ·Homan Square is just to the
12· northeast, the Homan Community Center here, and
13· then CDF's first projects, Power House High, which
14· was part of the overall Homan Square project, is
15· one block off to the northeast here.
16· · · · · · · · ·UCAN chose Lawndale because it's -17· for a couple reasons.· One, it's kind of in the
18· center of their youth client population.· Number
19· two, it's much more plugged in than their current
20· neighborhood to their client base, and they felt
21· that they could make a significant impact being
22· directly in the community with a new campus.
23· · · · · · · · ·The organization is also growing its
24· nonresidential programs, and so being housed in

·1· this type of location made a lot more sense than
·2· Irving Park.
·3· · · · MS. SCOTT:· Sorry to interrupt.· Are they
·4· actually closing another facility to move here, or
·5· what are they doing?
·6· · · · MR. SMITH:· Yeah; so the Irving Park facility
·7· is going to be closed down as soon as the two
·8· phases are done with the -- with this campus.· So
·9· phase one, which actually, if you go to the next
10· page after that one, you'll see a graphic of the
11· site.
12· · · · MS. SCOTT:· Yes.
13· · · · MR. SMITH:· So this is a two-phase project.
14· Phase one is actually already under construction.
15· That's a $27 million therapeutic youth home.· So
16· that's one of the two components that's on the
17· Irving Park campus.· That will be shut down on the
18· Irving Park location and sold as soon as they can
19· complete the construction of phase one.
20· · · · · · · · ·And then phase two, the smaller
21· building that's the subject of this vote, is the
22· other component of the Irving Park campus, which
23· would likewise be shut down and sold when it's
24· ready.

·1· · · · MS. SCOTT:· Okay.
·2· · · · MR. SMITH:· As far as the community benefits,
·3· this is primarily -- the impacts that we see for
·4· CDF are primarily the service to disadvantaged
·5· youth that have experienced trauma.
·6· · · · · · · · ·A couple of key programs:· The peace
·7· hub is an innovative initiative that UCAN is the
·8· project manager and fiscal agent of.· It has
·9· multiple members, nonprofits around the city
10· that serve youth that have experienced trauma,
11· developing shared metrics for measuring progress,
12· information sharing about best practices, and
13· filling in service gaps for individual youth
14· clients and a couple other components.· And then -15· · · · ALDERMAN TUNNEY:· Can I interrupt for a
16· second?
17· · · · MR. SMITH:· Yes, please.
18· · · · ALDERMAN TUNNEY:· What is the definition of
19· youth?
20· · · · MR. SMITH:· Youth.· In the case of UCAN,
21· mostly it's up to 18 years old.· Those are the
22· wards of the state.· But some of their programs
23· extend as far up as age 21.
24· · · · MS. SCOTT:· But the residential piece is up

·1· to 18?
·2· · · · MR. SMITH:· Yeah, residential is up to 18,
·3· and then their community outreach piece goes up to
·4· 21?
·5· · · · MR. SIMMONS:· 21, and then sometimes 24 in
·6· some programs.
·7· · · · MR. SMITH:· 360 school model.· So UCAN's been
·8· working in nine public schools with a series of
·9· programs that are basically aimed at the at-risk
10· students increasing their attendance rate, giving
11· their extracurricular support.· There's been
12· significant improvement in attendance, academic
13· outcomes, and reduction in fear of coming to school
14· and kind of other problems that interfere with
15· learning.
16· · · · · · · · ·And UCAN is a major operator of the
17· safe passage program in the Lawndale neighborhood.
18· They have 50-plus community watchers assisting
19· students in getting to school safely.
20· · · · · · · · ·Not a major job creation project,
21· at least that's not the projection from UCAN.· It
22· would basically be relocating their 103 permanent
23· full-time positions to this location.· And then
24· they already have the 50 community watchers that we

·1· discussed previously.
·2· · · · · · · · ·They do offer some youth
·3· employment opportunities as part of their 360 youth
·4· initiatives, so essentially summer jobs programs
·5· to assist neighborhood youth as part of their
·6· enrichment outside of school.
·7· · · · · · · · ·The building will be LEED Silver,
·8· 50 percent green roof, and significant storm water
·9· amenities.
10· · · · · · · · ·In terms of the deal structure,
11· so the proposed allocation from CDF is up to
12· $10 1/2 million, although potentially as little as
13· $9 million, and then there's an Illinois state tax
14· credit round which is likely to be upcoming.· It's
15· been announced by the state.· Although, of course,
16· everything is in flux at the state right now.
17· · · · · · · · ·If CDF is to obtain a state
18· allocation in this upcoming round, it would also be
19· committed -- or up to $10 million of it would be
20· committed to the UCAN project, and essentially the
21· state and federal credits would be stacked together
22· in this transaction.
23· · · · · · · · ·The New Markets investor.· It's down
24· to either JPMorgan Chase or U.S. Bank.· UCAN is

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc.· 312-781-9586

 · MEETING, 01/14/2015
Page 10

·1· looking at proposals from each one of them, and
·2· they're in sort of a bidding war, which actually
·3· helps UCAN a lot in terms of the net subsidy that
·4· each dollar of tax credit offers.
·5· · · · · · · · ·The primary leverage sources.· UCAN
·6· would actually temporarily liquidate some of its
·7· endowment investments and essentially lend those
·8· into the deal structure in anticipation of capital
·9· campaign proceeds.· The bulk of those are actually
10· already pledged to UCAN, but will be collected over
11· multiple years.· But they're also continuing to be
12· in capital campaign fundraising mode.
13· · · · · · · · ·They also have a bridge loan for the
14· sale proceeds from their existing Mozart campus.
15· That's the Irving Park facility.· And so a million
16· five of those proceeds would be used, as would some
17· cash in hand and a state capital grant.
18· · · · MR. SUMMERS:· I'm sorry, it's just that I
19· want to make sure I understand this.· So the net
20· federal New Markets equity and net state New
21· Markets equity and the borrowing from investments
22· totals the 9 -- I'm trying to tie that to the
23· $9 million number.
24· · · · MR. SMITH:· Okay.· So the allocation amount --

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc.· 312-781-9586
YVer1f

 · MEETING, 01/14/2015
Page 11

·1· and we apologize; you're getting a very quick
·2· description of a project in your first meeting.
·3· The allocation amount represents the size of the
·4· transaction that would actually flow through CDF.
·5· A portion of the funds will actually not flow
·6· through CDF; they will just be equity that UCAN
·7· contributes.· So CDF is serving as a lender to the
·8· project.
·9· · · · · · · · ·And so when you combine CDF's
10· loan, which would be probably $9 million if it's
11· $9 million of allocation, the balance of the funds
12· that are described there would be contributed by
13· UCAN as an equity over and above that loan amount.
14· · · · MR. SUMMERS:· Right.· So the 9 -- I'm just -15· where does the $9 million translate into these
16· sources?
17· · · · MR. SMITH:· Sure.· So the federal tax credit
18· on the $9 million of allocation would be 39 percent
19· of $9 million.· And then the investor, the tax
20· credit investor is going to pay a price that
21· represents a discount against that 39 percent
22· tax credit.· So the $3.1 million of net equity
23· represents that 39 percent credit rate plus the
24· investor pricing, and so $9 million -- in this

·1· case, $10 million of federal allocation nets down
·2· to $3.1 million of net federal tax credit equity.
·3· · · · MR. SUMMERS:· I follow.· And then the
·4· $10 million of state allocation, that's at a
·5· 2.26 -·6· · · · MR. SMITH:· Right.· The state credits are
·7· less valuable, relatively speaking, to the
·8· investment community.
·9· · · · MR. SUMMERS:· Right.· Okay.· I got it.· And
10· then the borrowing from investments is basically
11· things that they are liquidating and pledging.
12· · · · MR. SMITH:· Right.
13· · · · MR. SUMMERS:· Does that include the existing
14· facility?
15· · · · MR. SMITH:· So this would actually be their,
16· you know, mutual funds or other -17· · · · MR. SUMMERS:· So it's from their endowment.
18· · · · MR. SMITH:· It's from their endowment.· So
19· they would be bridging the capital campaign that
20· they are already in the midst of and essentially
21· lending that money to the tax credit investor who
22· in turn is pushing it through CDF's entities to -23· · · · MR. SUMMERS:· And the 886 is what they
24· already have already raised in the bank from the

·1· capital campaign?
·2· · · · MR. SMITH:· For this basic project, yes.
·3· · · · MR. SUMMERS:· And what's the total target of
·4· the capital campaign?
·5· · · · MR. SMITH:· I believe it's upwards of
·6· $5 million.
·7· · · · MR. SUMMERS:· All right.· I follow.
·8· · · · ALDERMAN TUNNEY:· And, I'm sorry, the Mozart
·9· building, the 1502, can you explain that one?
10· · · · MR. SMITH:· Yeah.· So that's part of -11· that's a portion of their existing headquarters
12· in the Irving Park neighborhood.· They have this
13· contract in place to sell that headquarters, and
14· so this is a bridge loan that their relationship
15· lender, U.S. Bank, has put in place in anticipation
16· of those sales proceeds when they do close on the
17· sale.
18· · · · ALDERMAN TUNNEY:· So do you have a projected
19· amount of what that property is worth?
20· · · · MR. SMITH:· I actually don't know off the top
21· of my head what the total sale proceeds -22· · · · ALDERMAN TUNNEY:· It looks like a large
23· property.· Nice neighborhood.

·4· · · · MS. SCOTT:· Yeah, I do.
·5· · · · MR. SUMMERS:· West Irving Park?
·6· · · · MS. SCOTT:· Right.
·7· · · · MS. SANCHEZ:· It's in between Addison and
·8· Irving.
·9· · · · ALDERMAN TUNNEY:· And they are also going to
10· be liquidating, or are they just pledging these
11· investments on the line item number one?· They're
12· going to be selling funds and -13· · · · MR. SMITH:· They would be liquidating a
14· portion of their endowment and then literally
15· lending the funds to the tax credit investor, and
16· then replenishing their endowment as the capital
17· campaign pledge is paid in.
18· · · · MR. SUMMERS:· Where -- in the materials I had
19· gotten beforehand, I think there was mention of
20· other public sources, TIF dollars that are
21· anticipated here -22· · · · MR. SMITH:· Yes.
23· · · · MR. SUMMERS:· -- and the land itself.· How do
24· those sort of fit into the --

 · MEETING, 01/14/2015
Page 15

·1· · · · MR. SMITH:· Sure.· So it being a two·2· phase project, UCAN is actually midway through
·3· construction on the therapeutic youth home, and
·4· that's a $27 million phase.
·5· · · · · · · · ·The City has committed $2 1/2
·6· million of TIF for the overall project.· It's in
·7· the budget for phase one, the way UCAN has divvied
·8· those two pieces up.· The City is in the process of
·9· closing on a redevelopment agreement to, you know,
10· finalize that commitment of funds.
11· · · · MR. SUMMERS:· And then we also contributed
12· land there?
13· · · · MS. KOTAK:· We did, for phase two.· So
14· they're building on land that they own on phase one,
15· but the land that we own is within the phase two
16· footprint.· There's some -17· · · · MR. SMITH:· I think it's two residential
18· parcels within this overall.
19· · · · MS. KOTAK:· And there are some environmental
20· issues they have been resolving with FFM.· So we're
21· ready to go as soon as we hear -- they need to hear
22· back from the IEPA, and they expect to hear that in
23· the next week.· So we expect to close on that and
24· the redevelopment agreement shortly.

·1· · · · MR. SUMMERS:· But the reality is then the
·2· sort of total project costs don't, in the sources
·3· and uses, include that contribution of land, right?
·4· · · · MR. SMITH:· Well, so there's no land costs
·5· included in the phase two budget.· Essentially all
·6· the money UCAN spent to acquire the -- the private
·7· portions of the campus was loaded into the phase
·8· one budget, and the City is conveying the two small
·9· parcels within the phase two footprint for a
10· dollar, so in effect it's not a cost that's being
11· shown on this source and use.
12· · · · MR. SUMMERS:· And they are paying for the
13· remediation?
14· · · · MS. KOTAK:· That's right.· And they had a
15· different New Markets allocation that we did not
16· have any part of through CDF on phase one.
17· · · · MS. SCOTT:· Is the state grant in hand or is
18· that kind of in the wish list?
19· · · · MR. SMITH:· It's committed.· They obviously
20· need to continue to build bridges with the new
21· administration to make -- to preserve it.
22· · · · MS. SCOTT:· What happens if it doesn't come
23· through?
24· · · · MR. SMITH:· Well, if it doesn't come through,

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc.· 312-781-9586

 · MEETING, 01/14/2015
Page 17

·1· then they would need to identify a backup source
·2· to fund that million dollars.· And so either the
·3· capital campaign would have to -- they either
·4· have to receive some more pledges or they have to
·5· increase the amount of temporary borrowing from
·6· investments.· So certainly the deal would not and
·7· could not close unless and until they actually got
·8· that finalized.
·9· · · · MR. SUMMERS:· Let me ask, apropos of Lois's
10· other question, which is, what's the value of the
11· asset they're selling?· What is the bridge, that is.
12· · · · CHAIRMAN MOONEY:· Well, I think it would
13· help:· How much do they have in reserves?
14· · · · MR. SMITH:· I think about a $30 million
15· endowment.
16· · · · MS. SCOTT:· Thank you.· That's nice.· That's
17· a very nice endowment.
18· · · · MR. SMITH:· And you're right, the bridge loan
19· against the sale proceeds for the property is at an
20· advance rate, I think it's 70 percent of the total
21· sale proceeds.
22· · · · MR. SUMMERS:· Got it.

·5· · · · MR. SUMMERS:· I'm sorry, just one other
·6· question, as the new guy here.· Just for projects
·7· like this in general, are there a set of criteria

·2· · · · CHAIRMAN MOONEY:· Yes.
·3· · · · MS. KOTAK:· That would be memorialized in the
·4· redevelopment agreement as well just from the City
·5· perspective.· So there's a couple different ways
·6· where you would get to that.· But there's equal
·7· opportunity provisions with every RDA.
·8· · · · MR. SUMMERS:· Presumably this all, just
·9· like any other RDA, local hiring, and, you know,
10· minority and women, et cetera, is all included in
11· the -- would be included in their RDA for phase two?
12· · · · MS. KOTAK:· So the redevelopment agreement
13· with the City that's distinct from CDF would have
14· provisions on hiring as related to the construction.
15· So that's the typical, which is for M/WBE, city
16· residency, and prevailing wage, through the receipt
17· of the TIF.· So those are embedded within the City
18· redevelopment agreement.
19· · · · MR. SUMMERS:· If the TIF went to phase one
20· and not phase two, it would still apply to phase
21· two?
22· · · · MS. KOTAK:· It is.· The budget covers both,
23· but the, kind of allocation of the money and when
24· they needed it was really put into the phase one

·1· transaction.
·2· · · · MR. SUMMERS:· Right.· And so that covers both
·3· hiring and subcontracting for the construction.
·4· · · · MS. KOTAK:· It does.· It imposes the
·5· requirements of the municipal code on them through
·6· the redevelopment agreement, but -- on the
·7· construction of the project.
·8· · · · MR. SUMMERS:· Great.
·9· · · · CHAIRMAN MOONEY:· Good questions.
10· · · · · · · · ·Any others?
11· · · · · · · · ·If not, is there a motion to accept
12· the project?
13· · · · MS. SCOTT:· Motion to accept the project.
14· · · · CHAIRMAN MOONEY:· Second?
15· · · · MR. SUMMERS:· Second.
16· · · · CHAIRMAN MOONEY:· It's been moved and
17· seconded.· All those in favor say aye.

19· · · · · · · · ·Okay.· Thank you.
20· · · · · · · · ·Can you streamline the discussion of
21· the prefunding?
22· · · · MR. SMITH:· I'll go as fast as I can.
23· · · · · · · · ·So the second resolution is
24· authorizing --

·1· · · · CHAIRMAN MOONEY:· This is item No. 6 on the
·2· agenda.
·3· · · · MR. SMITH:· -- delegating discretion to the
·4· president of CDF, which is Commissioner Mooney, the
·5· ability to authorize one or more prefundings of
·6· qualified equity investments in advance of the CDFI
·7· Fund's January 30th qualified equity investment
·8· deadline.
·9· · · · · · · · ·So this would grant some flexibility
10· in terms of finalizing which investor or investors
11· and what amounts to do the prefundings.
12· · · · · · · · ·So this chart just gives a bit of
13· context that already the board has authorized
14· prefunding the Englewood Square transaction with
15· PNC, and that's assuming we're on pace to do that.
16· So this would be authorizing up to $19 1/2 million
17· of additional prefunding with a likelihood that it
18· would be probably more like $9 or $10 million as
19· opposed to the entire $19 1/2.
20· · · · CHAIRMAN MOONEY:· For Kurt's purposes, give
21· just a thumbnail why we have to do this.
22· · · · MR. SMITH:· Sure.· There's a lot of
23· competitive pressure from Treasury to entities like
24· Chicago Development Fund.· CDF has peers out there,

 · MEETING, 01/14/2015
Page 22

·1· banks, nonprofit lenders, all sorts of different
·2· entities that it competes with in an open playing
·3· field for allocation each year.
·4· · · · · · · · ·And one of the key metrics that
·5· Treasury looks at is what percentage of your
·6· allocation from prior rounds you've actually
·7· deployed as of certain dates that they announce.
·8· And so receiving a qualified equity investment is
·9· the specific step that Treasury looks at.
10· · · · · · · · ·There's really two major steps in
11· the transaction:· Receiving the equity from the
12· investor, and then deploying it as a qualified loan
13· to the borrower.· And so this would be just doing
14· part one of that two-step process in advance of the
15· January 30th date, with some of the allocation, and
16· then in turn there's a 12-month clock that then
17· starts to actually take those proceeds and loan
18· them to a qualified project.
19· · · · MR. SUMMERS:· And the date is important
20· because we're applying for a new allocation?
21· · · · MR. SMITH:· Yes.· CDF applied in October
22· 2014, and Treasury's authorized to allocate new
23· awards in Q2 of this -- this year, and so this will
24· be the final look that Treasury takes at CDF's

·1· deployment progress as of January 30th.
·2· · · · MS. SCOTT:· It's a major factor.· We've done
·3· it in the past in order to make sure we present the
·4· best case for Chicago.
·5· · · · CHAIRMAN MOONEY:· And the good news is that
·6· New Markets Tax Credits were reauthorized in the -·7· was it the budget bill?
·8· · · · MR. SMITH:· It's the taxing standards bill.
·9· · · · MR. SUMMERS:· What's the size of this
10· application?
11· · · · MR. SMITH:· Well, CDF applied for, I think it
12· was about $90 million, but the award you get is
13· always less than you ask for.· The most recent
14· award of $43 million was the largest of any city in
15· the country, but less than some of the awards CDF
16· has gotten before.
17· · · · MR. SUMMERS:· And of the total prior
18· allocations, how much is still outstanding?
19· · · · MR. SMITH:· So, let's see, $30 million has
20· not been -- qualified equity investments haven't
21· been issued for $30 million of it.· 10 1/2 of that
22· 30 is committed to the Englewood Square project, so
23· 19 1/2 is unfunded, uncommitted at this time.
24· · · · MR. SUMMERS:· Okay.· Understand.

·1· · · · MS. SCOTT:· And as I read the resolution,
·2· there's nothing in there that designates it to any
·3· particular project, we're just delegating to the
·4· president to reserve it for projects as you see
·5· fit.· We're not saying it's going to go to UCAN.
·6· There's no messaging to the public on what we're
·7· using it for.
·8· · · · MR. SMITH:· Right.· And CDF would not be
·9· authorized to use these qualified equity investment
10· proceeds for projects other than those that have
11· been specifically looked at and approved by the
12· board.· So UCAN would be eligible, Englewood Square
13· would be eligible, but anything else would be a new
14· item considered in a future meeting.
15· · · · MS. SCOTT:· So this enables us to say that we
16· have allocated the funding -17· · · · MR. SMITH:· Yes.
18· · · · MS. SCOTT:· -- fully, and yet preserves our
19· ability to dedicate the use of that funding at a
20· subsequent board meeting.
21· · · · MR. SMITH:· Yes.
22· · · · CHAIRMAN MOONEY:· I neglected, and I
23· apologize, in my eagerness on the UCAN project, to
24· ask Rafael for anything from the Advisory Board.
