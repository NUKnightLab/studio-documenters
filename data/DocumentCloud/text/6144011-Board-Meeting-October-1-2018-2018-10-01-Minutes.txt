Harold Washington Library Auditorium. Further, a Pre-Submission Conference for JOC Services
RFP was held on September 26, 2018.
Following discussion, the Executive Director’s report was accepted.
The next item presented to the Board of Commissioners for consideration of approval
was the proposed 2019 Administrative Budget for the Public Building Commission.

The

Executive Director reported to the Commissioners that the proposed 2019 Public Building
Commission Administrative Budget was $9,616,792, which is approximately four per cent less
than the 2018 budget. She advised the Commissioners regarding the reduction in revenues
derived from bond lease revenue, which generates only $1.5 million annually and will expire
completely in 2020. Currently the Public Building Commission’s primary resource for funding
is through its Administrative Fees. She noted further that the level of resources for the
Commission’s administrative budget fluctuates as PBC’s workload (WIP) fluctuates and that the
estimated 2019 WIP for undertakings and anticipated projects is $268 million of which $119
million is from projects in planning. The Executive Director committed to continue to take
necessary action to ensure fiscal responsibility and solvency for the Commission.
After discussion and consideration, and upon motion duly made and seconded, the
proposed 2019 Public Building Commission of Chicago Consolidated Administrative Expense
Budget was unanimously approved and is attached hereto collectively as Exhibit “D”.

The next item presented to the Board of Commissioners for consideration of approval
was the proposed 2019 Operating and Capital Budget for the Richard J. Daley Center. The
Executive Director advised the Commissioners that the proposed Daley Center operating budget
for 2019 is $15,921,648, which represents a minimal increase of 0.90% over the 2018 budget.
The resulting rental rate for the Daley Center is $12.50 per square foot which compares
favorably to comparable commercial real estate in downtown Chicago. For 2019, cost savings in
the operating budget are expected to result from reductions in utilities and tenant steam, and
projected increases stem from annual increases to union cleaning, security services, engineering
wages and commercial liability insurance. The 2019 Capital Improvement Budget includes
$5,095,458 for new projects such as Building Automation System Upgrades, Façade and Louver
Repairs, Security Upgrades and Repairs to the Clark Street Stairway. The percentage for
Operating Expense Allocation for 2019 are as follows: Cook County – 95.88%, City of Chicago
– 0.34%, and Public Building Commission – 3.76%. After discussion and upon motion duly
made and seconded, the following resolution was unanimously adopted:
RESOLUTION NO. 8477
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners hereby approves the proposed
Richard J. Daley Center Operating and Capital Budgets for Fiscal Year 2019,
namely: $15,921,648 and $5,095,458, respectively, for a total 2019 budget
amount of $21,017,016.

2019 Annual Budget Executive Summary
Introduction
The Public Building Commission of Chicago and MB Real Estate Services Inc are pleased to
present the 2019 Operating and Capital Budget for the Richard, J. Daley Center. The 2019
operating expense budget of $15,921,648 reflects a minimal increase of 0.90% over the 2018
Budget of $15,779,771.
The 0.90% increase in operating expenses equates to $141,879 and is a result of annual
increases to union cleaning, security and engineering wages and increased property and
liability insurance premiums. These increases are primarily offset by lower projected costs
for utilities stemming from procurement of decreased electric and gas commodities.
Furthermore, 2017 tenant steam usage reconciliations will yield additional utility expense
credits of $290K in 2019.
The Percentage for Operating Expense Allocation for 2018 are as follows: Cook County –
95.88%, City of Chicago – 0.348% and Public Building Commission - 3.76%.
Operating Goals
The overall goals for 2019 are to continue to operate the Richard J. Daley Center at the same
high level of service while undertaking projects to improve the operating efficiencies, increase
Energy Star rating, enhance building security levels, assess and competitively bid building
services, sustain plaza event revenue levels, increase MBE/WBE participation and pursue
BOMA’s TOBY award for 2019. To achieve these goals we plan on undertaking the following
projects:
•

Energy Conservation Measures:
Performance metrics for Energy Star’s rating system and algorithm that drives the 1
to 100 Energy Star score have recently changed. Prior to 2018, the EPA was using
energy data from 2003. This data was replaced by 2012 energy survey results in
August 2018. As a result, the building’s Energy Star score has been reduced to 69
from 90.
Unfortunately, Energy Star requires a rating of 75 to achieve their annual designation.
Working in conjunction with the building’s engineering staff, ComEd and energy
consultants, we will create and pursue several energy conservation projects to lower
the building’s energy consumption and regain the Energy Star designation.

•

Elevator Maintenance RFP:
The current elevator maintenance service agreement with Schindler Elevator is set to
expire in 2019. In preparation of the request for proposal process, we will contract a
consultant to perform a maintenance audit of the service agreement and elevator
equipment. From there, the consultant will develop an RFP package to be
competitively bid and awarded by the first quarter of 2019.

Executive Summary

 •

Security Assessment:
Cook County plans to perform security risk assessments for a vast majority of their
facilities. This assessment will include the Richard Daley Center. As a result of the
assessment, a list of recommended upgrades will be considered for the building and a
contingency to implement the same is included within the 2019 Capital Improvement
Plan.

•

MBE/WBE Participation:
In efforts of increasing the building’s minority participation levels for both operating
and capital expenses, there are several steps that will be taken. First, we will work
closely with several organizations that support minority business to solicit interest for
projects within the building. Secondly, we plan to host an open house for minority
vendors to review all building services and ongoing capital improvement plan.

Budget Variance Explanations
When compared to the 2018 Operating Budget, 2019 operating expenses are anticipated to
increase by 0.90% or $141,879. Below are explanations for the variances between the 2018
and 2019 Operating budget operating accounts meeting a variance threshold of $5K and 5%.
•

The $237,896 increase in Retail Income is a result of the reclassification of special
events revenues which are now categorized as income, rather than offsets against the
building’s administrative payroll expense. Retail Income also includes projected
revenues associated with the Distributed Antenna Systems agreement which are
scheduled to commence in 2019.

Similar to Retail Income, there is a $225,708 increase in Administrative Expense
which is also tied to the reclassification of plaza event revenues. Prior to 2019, all
plaza event fees would offset administrative payroll expenses. Starting in 2019, plaza
event revenues will be classified as income and applied towards an income account.

•

The $291,311 increase in Income from Services Resold is due to projected increases
for Cook County and City of Chicago steam costs which is based on recent historical
usage. Furthermore, 2017 steam reconciliations have also increased the projected
costs for Cook County and City of Chicago steam in 2019.

•

The $477,344 decrease in Utilities results from recent procurement of electric and gas
commodities which have yielded very favorable market rates. In 2018, a very
conservative approach was taken towards the natural gas and electric budgets as the
building was in the process of competitively bidding 3rd party utility procurement
consulting services. As a result, a conservative approach was taken towards the 2018
utility budget.

•

The $160,600 increase in Security Expense stems from annual increases to labor rates
and expanded testing levels for the building’s life safety systems.

•

The $158,992 increase in Insurance Expense is primarily a function of the anticipated
rise in Property and Liability coverage which are procured by the Public Building
Commission.

PROPOSED 2019
BUDGET

1. See Electrical Budget Worksheet based on utility consultant usage projections and existing procurement rates.
2. See Natural Gas Budget based on utility consultant usage projections and existing procurement rates.
3. See Natural Gas Budget Worksheet (2019 Budget Tenant Steam Cost). Includes all costs for City Hall and County Building steam usage.
These costs are offset against the overall utility expense category.
Also, includes reconciliation performed for 2017 steam usage. Additional charges owed by City and County totals $94K and will be added to 2018 steam charges.
Variance is due to reconciliation credits or charges that vary from year to year based on City Hall/County Bldg usage.
4. See Water Budget Worksheet.
5. Energy Performance Contracting Loan (March 2011 through September 2025). Payments due in March and September. Funded by savings created and applied to utility and
maintenance expenses.
