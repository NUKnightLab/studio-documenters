the amount of $857,598.00, for the thirty-six (36) month period of 12/16/2016 thru 12/15/2019.

 
   

   

NEW PROPOSAL JUSTIFICATION:
This request is for the continual provision of maintenance and support of the Bed Tracking and Pro Admit software

applications that helps prevent overcrowding and patient wait time. This software uses existing telephone and pager 
networks to reach environmental service employees who then access all necessary information through an

interactive Voice Response System. This communication and information flow helps reduce the number of
emergent cleaning requests, improves bed turnover, and helps streamline and optimize patient flow.

    
     
 
     
     
 

This request is a sole source due to the proprietary software that can only be maintained by TeIetracking. To switch
to another Bed tracking and Pro Admit software solution at this time would be both cost prohibitive and disruptive to

operations.

 
   
   
   
 

TERMS OF REQUEST:
This is a request to extend and increase contract number in the amount of $510,731 .00, as needed, for
