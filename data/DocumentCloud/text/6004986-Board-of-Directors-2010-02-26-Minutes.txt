Report from Chairman of the Board
Update on upcoming report to the Cook County Board of Commissioners
Chairman Batts stated that he and William T. Foley, Chief Executive Officer of the Cook County Health and
Hospitals System, will be presenting a report to the Cook County Board at their meeting of March 16th. Some
of the subjects that will be reported on and discussed are the preliminary FY2009 financial statements and the
effects of the sales tax roll-back on the System’s budget.

A. Board Education – IRIS System
Dr. Enrique Martinez, Chief Medical Officer of the Ambulatory and Community Health Network of Cook
County (ACHN), presented an overview of the IRIS System (Attachment #1). John Prendegast, IRIS
Administrator, presented additional information.
The subject of patient volumes for the ten (10) clinics which were closed as a result of the budget cuts in
FY2007 arose. Dr. Martinez stated that prior to their closing, these clinics experienced 50,000 patient visits
per year. Director Carvalho noted that this volume was miniscule in comparison to the ACHN clinics’
overall volume of 750,000 patient visits per year in 2007.
During the discussion on referrals and backlogs, Director Carvalho inquired whether there was an estimate
of how many referrals lead to patient encounters. Dr. Martinez responded that approximately only half of
the referrals lead to patient encounters; this is a result of “no-shows” for scheduled appointments and
difficulties experienced trying to contact the patients. With regard to waiting lists and backlogs, Director
Carvalho requested a report with additional information. Dr. Martinez noted that information on that
subject was provided at the last Quality and Patient Safety Committee Meeting; this information will be
forwarded to the Board. Director Ansell stated that the Quality and Patient Safety Committee should
receive periodic updates on this subject. He added that it might be useful to get input from some of the
partners/community health centers with whom the System partners. Mr. Foley noted that they have spent a
lot of time meeting with the federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) to go over any issues and get input,
and have assembled a small work team to address some issues with the Alivio Medical Center.
Additionally, he stated that there are work groups currently addressing the issue of backlogs.
During Mr. Prendegast’s presentation, Director O’Donnell inquired whether there is a mechanism to track
coverage of the referrals made from outside of the System, and asked what percentage of those referrals
have some type of coverage. Mr. Prendegast responded that the IRIS System alone does not track
coverage, however, they do have this information on the referrals for children. Mr. Foley stated that this
information can be provided.
Director Carvalho inquired further regarding the IRIS partners from outside of the System, and referrals of
patients with unidentified payer status. Dr. Martinez stated that most have been partners for over ten years,
and were established by the previous County administration. Director Carvalho inquired further regarding
why the University of Chicago’s Emergency Department is a partner. Dr. Martinez responded that they
only refer pediatric patients, and Director Golden provided additional information on the history of the
relationship.

Report from Chief Executive Officer
Update on Joint Commission Visit to John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County
Mr. Foley provided an update on the visit from the Joint Commission to John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook
County. He stated that they arrived on Tuesday, February 23rd, and were expected to complete their survey
this afternoon. He noted that Chairman Batts and Director Muñoz planned on staying after the Board meeting
for a leadership session with the Joint Commission representatives.
Report on Disposal Process for Mammography Vans located at John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of
Cook County
John Morales, Chief Financial Officer of John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County, provided a report on
the disposal process currently underway for the mammography vans located behind John H. Stroger, Jr.
Hospital of Cook County. He stated that this report to the Board was being provided for disclosure purposes.
Mr. Morales stated that there are currently two mammography vans that have been out of service for almost
five years and which are deemed obsolete, that have been parked behind the hospital. All equipment that had
any value has been removed, now they are down to salvage value. They received three bids, and have the
titles ready for transfer. Once this information has been disclosed to the Board, sale and transfer of title can
occur.
A. Management Assessment/Organizational Restructuring
Mr. Foley provided an update on management assessment and organizational restructuring, and presented
an organizational chart (Attachment #2). He noted that the affiliate Chief Nursing Officers now directly
report to the System’s Chief Clinical Officer, Roz Lennon. They previously reported to the affiliate Chief
Operating Officers, with an indirect relationship to Ms. Lennon. He added that Human Resources is
another function that is now highly centralized.
B. FY2010 System Operational Plan Update
Mr. Foley presented the FY2010 System Operational Plan (Attachment #3) on behalf of Dr. Anthony
Tedeschi, Interim Chief Operating Officer for the Cook County Health and Hospitals System. He
provided an update on several areas of interest.
The Board reviewed and discussed the information. Suggestions were made with regard to the placement
of and attention to the “red” or significant issues identified within the report. Mr. Foley responded that the
update at the next Board meeting will reflect the changes suggested.

C. Leadership Goals Update
Mr. Foley presented the revised goals for System leadership (Attachment #4), and noted the inclusion of
medical education relationships in the list of goals. He stated that, going forward, he would like to use
this as the basis for his report, as these are the major goals that he and the senior leadership team are
working on. He provided an update on the goals presented.

Update from ad hoc Strategic Planning Committee
A. Strategic Planning Update
Mr. Foley introduced John Abendshien of Integrated Clinical Solutions (ICS), and stated that Mr.
Abendshien will be providing regular updates on strategic planning. Mr. Foley noted that for the April
Board Meeting, it is anticipated that the meeting will be abbreviated, and will be followed by a Strategic
Planning retreat.
Mr. Abendshien presented his update on the progress of the Phase II analysis. Mayur Patel, of ICS,
provided an overview of community needs analytics that they have been conducting.
The Board reviewed and discussed the information (Attachment #5). Discussion took place on the
possible scenarios presented. Additional topics discussed included those relating to consolidation
opportunities and coordination with existing community resources (such as FQHCs).

B. UCMC/CCHHS Joint Consulting Project regarding Provident Hospital of Cook County
Mr. Foley presented information on a proposal for a joint project with the University of Chicago Medical
Center (UCMC) and Provident Hospital of Cook County (Attachment #6). He noted that this proposal
was reviewed and approved by the ad hoc Strategic Planning Committee, which consisted of only Director
Greenspan, due to Director Golden’s recusal on the subject.
Mr. Foley clarified the basics of the proposal, stating that, at this point, this is only relating to an
assessment and exploration of the feasibility of such an arrangement. Contained within the minutes of the
Finance Committee Meeting of February 19th is a recommendation for approval of an item to jointly fund
with UCMC an assessment of a possible collaboration. Ultimately, should this type of collaboration take
place, it would be an academic and clinical relationship. UCMC would provide faculty and co-invest in
the further development of Provident Hospital of Cook County, but it would owned, managed and staffed
by the System.
Director Zopp, seconded by Director Butler, moved that the System engage in the consulting project, as
proposed.
Director Carvalho inquired regarding the proposed structure of such an arrangement. Mr. Foley
responded that the assessment will provide the answers to the question of structure. He provided
additional information on what is expected when the assessment is completed. Additionally, he stated that
by the next Board Meeting on March 26th, they expect to have prepared a recommendation for the Board
to determine whether to go forward or not go forward with the proposal.
Director Ansell inquired whether a conflict of interest exists for Michael Koetting, who used to work for
UCMC, and who is assisting the System with this proposal. Mr. Foley responded that Mr. Koetting’s
conflict has been declared, and it is Mr. Foley’s job to manage this proposed collaboration.
On the motion, a voice vote was taken and THE MOTION CARRIED.
Director Golden recused herself and voted PRESENT.

all necessary diagnostic services
• The CCHHS is the health system in Illinois
with a public hospital and specialty system
for the indigent

 Benefits of the CCHHS’ IRIS
System
• High volume and efficiency: About 18,000
referrals per month

• All partner clinics use IRIS
• An “even playing field” for all CCHHS and
non-CCHHS sites
• All CCHHS specialty and diagnostic
services (at three hospitals) are available
to all referring providers

Page 18 of 109

 Benefits of the CCHHS’ IRIS
System (contd.)
• Added capacity to system, about 20-25%,
by eliminating misdirected referrals,
requiring work up before specialty visit
• Backlogs exist in less than 10% of clinics

Page 19 of 109

 Benefits of the CCHHS’ IRIS
System (Contd.)
• Development of clinical referral rules:
1. Triage patients electronically
2. Require work up before specialty visit
3. Use specialists as specialists
4. Educate PCPs
5. Prioritize referrals
6. Ability to escalate referral to RN when
needed

Page 20 of 109

 Benefits of the CCHHS’ IRIS
System (contd.)
• Consolidation of referrals to all specialty
and primary care services in CCHHS
• Availability of whole system, giving
patients access close to their home
• Primary care access now available to ER,
specialists, and urgent care areas
• Centralizing primary care referrals also
improved efficiency and access in CCHHS
Page 21 of 109

 Benefits of the CCHHS’ IRIS
System (contd.)
• Data, data, data…
• Reports
• Automated phone notification in three
languages, reminder 10 days and 2 days
before appointment via IVR
• Ability to partner with FQHC, State, and
other organizations using this system

Page 22 of 109

 New IRIS Functionality
• Ability to send email or text message
notification to patients, about their
appointments

Page 23 of 109

 IRIS Success Examples
• Mammography Backlog: Due to IRIS data and
reports, were able to eliminate a backlog of over
12,000 to 0.
• Colonoscopy Backlog: Backlog of over 4,000
now down to a few hundred, schedule wait down
from years to a few weeks.
• Gyne dysplasia backlog: Quickly eliminated a
backlog of 200, by partnering with FQHC site.

Page 24 of 109

 Challenges of the CCHHS’ IRIS
System
• Providers have to enter the referral: it
takes a couple of minutes per referral
• Patients have difficulty with the interactive
voice response system
• Technology upkeep and expense
• Not all backlogged areas get resolved or
addressed

Page 25 of 109

 Challenges (contd.)
• IRIS was built with federal funding and FQHC
partnering support
• Partnership is now smaller due to 2007 budget
crisis, and agenda of system leadership
• FQHCs not willing to refer a mix of patients,
paying and non-paying, are not allowed to refer
to County
• Partnership under current evaluation with new
board and new CEO

 Summary and Implications



Cook County has a low overall ranking based on its composite health
indicators. Major priorities for intervention and health improvement include
heart disease, HIV, injury and violence, infant health/family planning,
obesity, respiratory disease, and sexually transmitted diseases.



The community areas with the lowest health rankings—Near South Side,
Southland, East Southland—have the least health resource coverage.
Access to health care is a major issue in these communities.



These same areas account for the majority of inpatient admissions to
CCHHS:



–

John J. Stroger, Jr. Hospital—broad geographic distribution

–

Provident Hospital—proximate neighborhood

–

Oak Forest—fairly broad distribution, including significant numbers from East
Southland communities.

Bottom Line: There is a fundamental mismatch of County and community
health care resources relative to need. Future outpatient development and
overall resource allocation priorities should be focused to address this need.

Joint Provident Consulting Project

      

The University of Chicago and Cook County Health and Hospitals System anticipate
jointly hiring a consultant to help the two institutions assess the feasibility of expanding both the
inpatient and outpatient offerings at Provident Hospital though a collaborative initiative in which 
retained administrative control and UCMC provided the bulk of the medical staff.

The anticipated scope of work has five components, separated into two phases

Phase I Completed by April 1
1. Market assessment
2 Facility assessment
3. Financial assessment
4 "Go/No-Go" decisions

Phase II Completed by July 1
5. Detailed clinical configuration
6. Assistance in development of business plan

Six potential firms were jointly selected to receive a Request for Engagement.

Five of the six firms responded. Two firms were eliminated, one because the firm proposed to partner
with a group that been earlier eliminated by potential conflicts and the other because its proposed
prices were more than an order of magnitude greater than the next highest proposal. The other three
firms were invited to present to a group of managers from each institution.

The reviewing group recommended Health Strategies 8: Solutions is Philadelphia-based
but has Chicago market experience. had the lowest price of the three presenting firms, but also
reflected substantial substantive advantages including the fact their team has a long history of working
together, their team is small and dominated by firm principals, they have specific experience working on
similar projects, and their style seemed most suited to bring the two parties to a common understanding

of the issues around a potential partnership.

Conversation around the specifics of contracting is now under way. The general approach anticipated is
for UCMC to contract with and to make an agreement with UCMC to reimburse half ofthe
costs. The agreement with UCMC will be brought to the Finance Committee on February 19 and the
Board on February 26. The proposed costs for the project were for Phase 1 and a similar

amount for Phase 2.

The contract will be managed by a small Joint Steering Committee and Mike Koetting will provide lead
staffing for the project. Current anticipation is for a brief update at the February Board meeting and a
much more substantial discussion in March, prior to the conclusion of Phase 1.

Executive Medical Staff Committee (EMS Committee) and subsequently considered at
the EMS Committee meeting held on February 9, 2010. The EMS Committee voted to
approve the proposed amendments submitted to it by the Bylaws Committee, subject to
the addition of a sentence in Article XII as set forth in paragraph 10 below. A copy of the
existing Bylaws, with proposed revisions as approved by the Executive Medical Staff
Committee shown in tracked changes (underlined and stricken text), is attached to this
Report and referred to as the Attachment. The following summarizes the recommended
changes set forth in the Attachment:

Page 105 of 109

 

4. Article IV, Categories of the Medical Staff, is proposed to be amended to delete
language limiting the eligibility of any member of the Medical Staff to hold elective
of?ce as a member of the Executive Medical Staff Committee.
0 Rationale: These proposed modi?cations are intended to achieve closer
compliance with standard MS.02.01.01 EP3 providing that all members of
the Medical Staff are eligible for membership on EMS.

5. Article VI, Clinical Privileges, Section 2, Temporary Clinical Privileges and
Administrative Appointment, Sections page 46 (Temporary Clinical
Privileges) and 2(b)(ii) page 47 (Administrative Appointment) are proposed to be
amended to provide that temporary clinical privileges (and related administrative
appointments) may be held for no longer than 120 days, rather than 6 months, for new
appointments.

0 Rationale: this provision is intended to achieve compliance with TJ standard

MS.06.01.13 limiting temporary privileges to 120 days.

6. Article X, Composition and Duties of the Executive Medical Staff Committee,
Section 1(d) is proposed to be amended to add a sentence providing that ?All members of
the Medical Staff shall be eligible to be elected and to serve as a member of the
Executive Medical Staff Committee.?
0 Rationale: this provision is intended to achieve closer compliance with TJC
standard MS.02.01.01 EP3 providing that all members of the Medical Staff are
eligible for membership on EMS.

7. Article X, Section 2(a) is proposed to be amended to more clearly articulate that
the EMSC acts in behalf of the organized medical staff between meetings of that body.

edited to mirror the more speci?c language found in TJC standard MS.02.01.02
EPS.

8. Article XI, Section 2, Medical Ethics Committee, is proposed to be amended to
change the name ?Infant Care Medical Ethics Committee? to ?Pediatrics Subcommittee
of the Medical Ethics Committee.?

9. Article XI, Section 9, Diagnostic Services Committee, is proposed to be amended
to change the name ?Infant Care Medical Ethics Committee? to ?Pediatrics
Subcommittee of the Medical Ethics Committee.?

Medical Staff may do so pursuant to his authority to establish ad hoc committees

10. Article XII, Joint Conference Committee, is proposed to be revised to re?ect the
current membership consisting of the three Board members who sit on the Quality and

Page 106 of 109

 

Patient Safety Committee, System and Hospital leadership, and Medical Staff leadership.

In the event that the past president cannot serve, the current president has the authority to

appoint a non-voting member to the CC.
0 Rationale: This proposed revision re?ects current Board and System leadership.

11. Article XVII, Section 2(d) (page 91) is proposed to be modi?ed to provide that
neither the organized medical staff nor the governing body may unilaterally amend the
Medical Staff Bylaws.

Rationale: The procedure for modifying the Medical Staff Bylaws already
requires approval of changes by both the EMS and the Board. However, this
provision has been added to achieve greater clarity on this point and to mirror the
speci?c language found in TJC standard MS.01.01.03.
