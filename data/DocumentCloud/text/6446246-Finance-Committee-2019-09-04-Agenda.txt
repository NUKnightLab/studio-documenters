Good and Welfare/Public Comment

Members of the public are welcome to address the Board during this time for no more than two
minutes. (The Board Liaison will notify the Chair when the time limit has been met.) Individuals
are encouraged to identify themselves and fill out a comment card to leave with the Board
liaison; however, those individuals that do not want to identify themselves may still address
the Board. Issues raised during Good and Welfare/Public Comment that are of concern to the
general public and may initiate an inquiry and follow-up will be responded to and may be
posted to the website. Feedback will be posted within a reasonable timeframe (information
that is HIPAA related or of a confidential nature will not be posted but rather responded to on
an individual basis).
