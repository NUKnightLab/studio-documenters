A5 Branding Discussion
A5 Branding & Digital presents their new branding campaign for Howard Street
which includes a newly designed website and close-up faces of business owners
with the name of their company on the banners and four message banners:
Chicago's Edge; Where You Can Be You; We Are All and a design with half of a H
symbol. It was suggested to change the banner with half of H symbol to
#howardstreetchicago.
Launch:
Will launch Labor Day
The 2nd day of photos has been scheduled for 8/25.
The 1st shoot was heavier on places; the 2nd shoot will focus on people.
The banners will be up the middle of Sept if don’t wait for 8/25 photos.
Social Media:
Website
Howardstreetchicago.com website (hellohoward website will redirect to this)
The website was built in SquareSpace and is easy to update.
Events – pulls from calendar in SquareSpace and is maintained by A5 and RPBA.
Viewed realwoodstock.com for examples.
FaceBook
HelloHoward FB has been rebranded.
New FB feature to change main page photo? Or change every month or two?
A5 will make sure something is scheduled – they will work with RPBA.
There are 585 followers currently – want to boost this, grow the number of
followers – be more people focused.

the 28th and review them)
Use Bannerville?
Need to decide on for banners:
1. Faces only
2. Alternate face with branding message
3. Face, face, message
4. Face, message, face, message
Need to put business names on the banners.
Need to put contact info on the banners - #HowardStreetChicago
What if new businesses want to get in on the branding going forward? There
will be a ‘round 2’. We could switch out x% each year.
Need compliment to the banners – could be Howard Street posters, counter
cards. (Nixed QR codes since no one uses them anymore.)
The banners will be 2 sided with the same print on both sides.
Will use 10 – 12 different faces – ideally 1 per business.
Need to pull old Hello Howard stickers.
Amy and Ben are the photographers – husband and wife team, each brings
different perspective.
Charlotte Walters moved to approve the new Howard St. branding campaign,
website and banners. Carrie Sullivan seconds it. Motion passed.
