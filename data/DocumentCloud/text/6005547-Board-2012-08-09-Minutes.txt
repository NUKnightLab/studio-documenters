Action Items
A. Proposed Amendments to the Rules of Organization and Procedure of the Board of Directors of the
Cook County Health and Hospitals System (Attachment #1)
Elizabeth Reidy, System General Counsel, provided an overview of the proposed Amendments to the Rules
of Organization and Procedure of the Board of Directors of the Cook County Health and Hospitals System.
During the discussion of the proposed Amendments, Chairman Carvalho noted that there is typically a section
within bylaws that provides for the amending of the rules from time to time. Ms. Reidy indicated that she
will review the existing language and draft an amendment, if necessary, for the Board’s consideration at the
next meeting2.
Director Velasquez, seconded by Director Butler, moved the approval of the proposed
Amendments to the Rules of Organization and Procedure.
Following discussion, Chairman Carvalho indicated that an additional amendment was
needed to correct a section in the Rules. In Rule 4, Organization, Section d(1),
Membership and officers of Committees and Subcommittees, on page 5, in the second
paragraph, the last sentence should be amended as follows: The Committee Chair may
appoint non-Director members to a Subcommittee.
Directors Velasquez and Butler concurred with the amendment to their original motion to
approve the proposed Amendments.
On the motion, as amended, to approve the proposed Amendments to the Rules of
Organization and Procedure, a voice vote was taken and THE MOTION CARRIED
UNANIMOUSLY.

B. Contracts and Procurement Items (Attachment #2)
Gina Besenhofer, System Director of Supply Chain Management, presented the requests for the Board’s
consideration. She noted that request number 3 is being withdrawn from consideration, as it remains
pending review by the Cook County Office of Contract Compliance. The Board reviewed and discussed the
requests.
Chairman Carvalho stated that several different sources of ethics guidance to the Board are all incorporated
by reference in the Rules of the Board. In the past, the Board has received ethics training through the
presentation of information as Board Education; he indicated that it would be beneficial for the Board to
have a refresher course on this subject as a Board Education topic in the near future (see page 5 for listing
of future Education topics requested at this meeting).
Additionally, with regard to the subject of providing the new Directors with detailed review of System
processes, such as those relating to purchasing and the Supply Chain processes, Chairman Carvalho
indicated that he prefers that the sharing of this information be done at Board or Committee meetings as
Education items; this will allow the public to also be further informed on these subjects

Action Items
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)
Several suggestions were made regarding the inclusion of additional information and data, and for further
clarification of information for requests presented in the future; staff will work on any revisions that are
needed to be made to the request transmittal template to enhance the format, and will incorporate the
additional information or data in future requests3.
During the Board’s review of the requests, the following subjects were further discussed: indirect
participation, with regard to Contract Compliance and minority and women-owned business enterprise
(MBE/WBE) goals; centralization and standardization of some services provided to the System; the need
for inclusion of information relating to any indirect benefits for a particular request, even if there is not a
direct reduction in cost; methodologies employed in the process of the selection of vendors; the benefits of
purchasing under a group purchasing organization (GPO), and processes used in such purchasing; the
monitoring, evaluating and testing of the market by Supply Chain staff, to ensure that the System is getting
the best products or services at the most cost-effective price; the use of reverse auctions in the selection of a
vendor for a product or service – this involves the use of the internet and is conducted like a live auction,
except in this case it is the buyer who is conducting the auction; and the need to include information in the
requests regarding factors that drive increases to costs.
During the discussion of request number 8, Chairman Carvalho requested that the Finance Committee
receive an update in the near future on Information Technology operations and impact of the Shared
Services amendment that was approved by the Cook County Board during their FY2012 Budget
deliberations4.
With regard to request number 11, Director Michael noted that there was an error in the contract dates listed
in the transmittal’s section on prior contract history5.
With regard to the subject of standardization, Chairman Carvalho noted that he read a report last week on
efforts to standardize practice, especially in surgery; efforts to standardize practice at Massachusetts
General were very successful. He stated that it would be useful to receive information in the Quality and
Patient Safety Committee on how the System is making efforts to standardize practice, as well6. Dr. Ram
Raju, Chief Executive Officer, responded that he agrees that the subject should be further discussed. While
standardization of practice can be beneficial, it can also be challenging if doctors have trained on a
particular instrument over so many years and excel with that particular instrument; additionally, there are
certain companies that produce a superior product than other companies.

Vice Chairman Ramirez temporarily assumed the Chair.
Director O’Donnell, seconded by Director Morris, moved the approval of request
numbers 1 through 13, with the exception of request number 3, under the Contracts and
Procurement Items. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

The following subjects were indicated as future Board or Committee Education Items:
Future Board Education Items:7

Committee Education Items8:

C. Proposed Academic Affiliation Agreements (Attachment #3)
Chairman Carvalho resumed the Chair.
John O’Brien, MD, System Chair of Planning, Education and Research, presented the request for the Board’s
consideration. He provided an overview on the subject of academic affiliation agreements and residency
programs; he noted that the System is engaged in approximately thirty (30) agreements with dollars attached to
them, and is engaged in over one hundred (100) that do not have dollars attached to them.
The Board further discussed the subject. Chairman Carvalho indicated that a work group of Directors under
the leadership of Sister Sheila Lyne had previously been responsible for reviewing these agreements; as
Director Lyne has now retired from the Board, going forward, the Board should determine whether a work
group for this purpose should be reconstituted9. He stated that the residency programs that the System has are
very important; some Board oversight may be needed to ensure that the agreements and relationships are all in
the best interest of the System.
The Board discussed the subject of providing high-quality patient care and meeting the needs of patients to
ensure a favorable patient experience, and meeting obligations in a teaching hospital environment. Chairman
Carvalho stated that the subject is one that should continue to be discussed, particularly in the context of being
prepared for the Affordable Care Act implementation; when patients have choices, the care has to be patientcentered and attractive to patients, and only incidentally meet the System’s education needs. Dr. Raju agreed;
when balancing medical education needs with patient care needs, patient care needs always come first.
Director Velasquez, seconded by Director O’Donnell, moved the approval of request
number 1, under the Proposed Academic Affiliation Agreements. THE MOTION
CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

Report from Chairman of the Board
A. Board Education – Overview of New Board Member Orientation Sessions and information (Attachment
#4)
Chairman Carvalho noted that an orientation packet for new Board Members has been prepared and
distributed; it will be made available to all Directors for their information10. A recent four-hour orientation
session for new members covered topics such as general information and organizational structure of the
System and affiliates; Strategic Plan – Vision 2015; Budget and Finance; CCHHS Enabling Ordinance; Rules
of the Board; and the Illinois Open Meetings Act.

VII. Report from Chief Executive Officer (Attachment #5)
Dr. Raju provided an update on the following subjects: Budget; Section 1115 Waiver; Oak Forest Health Center;
Logan Square Clinic; and Public Health Update.
Additionally, Dr. Raju’s report included the recognition of the following events:
 National Cancer Survivors Day
 John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County Approved for Accreditation for their Post-Graduate Year
One (PGY-1) Pharmacy Residency Training Program
 Oak Forest Mail Order Prescription Service Implements Changes to Improve Patient Service
 Internal Promotion
 Patient Thank You
The Board discussed the tentative plans relating to the introduction, presentation and approval process for the
CCHHS FY2013 Preliminary Budget. The plan, as it currently stands, is to introduce it to the Finance Committee
at the meeting of August 24th; to hold public hearings; and to present it for the System Board’s approval,
following the public hearings. It was noted that, given the timing of this plan, it is likely that the regularly
scheduled System Board Meeting of August 30th will need to be rescheduled to a later date, possibly in the week
of September 3rd, in order to accommodate the scheduling of public hearings prior to the Board’s consideration
and approval. This plan aligns with the tentative proposed timeline that allows for the CCHHS FY2013
Preliminary Budget to be approved by the System Board and presented to the Cook County Board at their meeting
on September 10th.
The Board discussed the question of when the Finance Committee will receive the budget documents for the
meeting on August 24th. Past processes regarding the System Board and Finance Committee’s review,
consideration and approval of the preliminary budget were described. Dr. Raju noted that it is the
administration’s intention to provide the budget documents to the Finance Committee as soon as possible. He
stated that there are many unknown elements at this time, particularly with regard to the Section 1115 Waiver and
revenue projections, that are currently being reviewed.
Dr. Raju indicated that it is also his intent to work with staff and the County’s Department of Budget and
Management Services to present a fully completed and finalized preliminary budget document for the System
Board’s consideration, that will not require any subsequent amendments prior to submission to the County Board.
Following the System Board’s approval of last year’s preliminary budget, a gap between the amount of what the
System thought it needed and what the County Board was willing to provide was negotiated, with Board
involvement; an amendment to the System Board-approved preliminary budget was required as a result of the
negotiations.

VII. Report from Chief Executive Officer (continued)
Chairman Carvalho stated that he will work with Dr. Raju and the Board Secretary to further determine and refine
the plan for the preliminary budget process. As mentioned earlier in the meeting, he will be soliciting the interest
of Directors on their preferences for Committee assignments; Committee assignments will be established as soon
as possible in order to get on track with tasks and responsibilities of Committees, including those of the Finance
Committee that are related to reviewing the preliminary budget and conducting public hearings.
A. Update on Oak Forest Health Center Campus (Attachment #6)
Anna Ashcraft, Director of the Cook County Real Estate Management Division, presented an update on a
project that involves the creation of a new forest preserve adjacent to the Oak Forest Health Center
Campus. The Board reviewed and discussed the information.
Director Michael inquired regarding the plan for funding and staffing of the project and proposed visitors
center. Ms. Ashcraft responded that the County is not asking the System to fund anything at this point; she
noted that there is a plan to reach out to potential donors, including not-for profit corporations and
foundations, for possible funding.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER 
COOK COUNTY HEALTH AND HOSPITALS SYSTEM 
REPORT TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
August 9, 2012 
 
BUDGET 
The FY2012 revenue budget included approximately $99,000,000 of one time only sources of revenue.  
The  revenue  estimates  for  FY2013  are  based  on  the  experience  of  FY2012  and  an  estimate  for  the 
capitation  revenue  that  the  1115  Wavier  Demonstration  Project  would  provide.    In  FY2012  there  are 
changes being made to the Cerner system that will help capture more charges to increase patient fee 
revenue in FY2012 and FY2013.   
 
The  FY2013  budget  includes  expenses  for  the  provision  of  services  under  the  1115  Wavier 
Demonstration  Project.    CCHHS  Leadership  is  reviewing  all  other  appropriation  requests  to  look  for 
savings.  In FY2013 there will be a major effort to reduce supply chain expenditures through the use and 
implementation  of  the  GHX  contract  management  system.    Additional  staff  are  being  recruited  to

Since the Section 1115 Waiver Demonstration Project proposal was formally submitted in January 2012, 
CMS  (“the  Centers  for  Medicare  and  Medicaid  Services”)  appears  seriously  engaged  in  the  proposal.  
Three telephone conferences since July 13th have explored substantive CMS questions in detail with an 
enlarged CMS review team.    
Our view is that CCHHS/HFS (“Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family services”) have raised their 
credibility with CMS by responding in depth to CMS questions, both orally and in writing.   CCHHS/HFS 
consistently  have  demonstrated  that  they  have  thoughtfully  anticipated  and  addressed  issues  of  high 

Page 59 of 73

 concern  to  CMS,  e.g.,  enrollment  ramp‐up  estimates,  methodology  for  estimating  per  member  per 
month  (PMPM)  reimbursement,  amending  existing  intergovernmental  agreements  for  conformance 
with the waiver, etc. 
CCHHS,  with  support  from  HFS,  continues  to  reiterate  the  importance  of  waiver  approval  for  our 
patients, for the health system, and for Cook County, particularly as budgeting for FY2013 has begun. 
 
OAK FOREST HEALTH CENTER 
The  Capital  Project  Committee  continues  to  make  progress  in  the  planning  of  the  Oak  Forest  Health 
Center.   The demolition/construction bid package was posted on July 6, 2012 and the bid opening was 
July  19,  2012.    On  July  24,  2012  the  Cook  County  Board  of  Commissioners  approved  the  request  to 
execute a contract with The Lombard Company for the renovation of the ground floor of the E Building.  
Construction is scheduled to begin in August with an expected completion date by December 2012. 
 
LOGAN SQUARE CLINIC 
The Logan Square renovation project consisted of converting an existing WIC space that was no longer 
used into the three exam rooms and one existing storage room into an office for a social worker.  The 
project was completed in 45 days. 
 
PUBLIC HEALTH UPDATE 
Cook  County  Department  of  Public  Health  continues  on  its  path  toward  accreditation  with  document 
selection  to  demonstrate  its  achievement  of  the  standards  and  measures  of  the  Public  Health 
Accreditation Board in process. Charters are in process for the internal Quality Committee and the Policy 
Committee.  Demonstration  projects  funded  through  the  Communities  Putting  Prevention  to  Work 
(CPPW) are in the final phases of completion and projects are being reviewed for sustainability through 
Community  Transformation  Grant  (CTG)  funding  from  the  federal  government.  The  Community 
Preparedness  and  Coordination  Unit  which  is  responsible  for  public  health  emergency  preparedness 
activities was reviewed against standards set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on June 
8,  2012  and  received  a  score  of  100%  improving  from  the  last  review  of  97%.  Since  initiating  the 
registration  process  to  comply  with  the  Cottage  Food  Act,  four  (4)  cottage  food  vendor  registrations

 were  processed.  The  Environmental  Health  Services  Unit  continued  their  seasonal  activities  of  vector 
surveillance activities for the West Nile Virus and public swimming pool inspections. The Communicable 
Disease Unit is investigating two (2) reported cases of West Nile Virus illness in suburban Cook County. 
These were the first human cases reported in the state. The unusually hot, dry summer has moved the 
typical timeline for human cases from August to July. 
 
RECOGNITION 
National Cancer Survivors Day 
National Cancer Survivors Day is an annual celebration traditionally held on the first Sunday in June.  On 
Sunday,  June  3,  2012  the  celebration  in  Stroger  Hospital’s  cafeteria  hosted  close  to  500  guests  –  the 
largest group yet.  The program featured patient testimonials, musical entertainment and food. I would 
like  to  thank  the  co‐chairs  of  the  Cancer  Survivors  Day  Committee  Drs.  Margaret  Telfer  and  Rose 
Catachatourian and the various departments throughout the hospital that contributed to the planning 
and  preparation  of  this  celebration.    Most  importantly  I  would  like  to  acknowledge  our  patients,  our 
cancer survivors and their families for they are an inspiration to us all. 
 
John H. Stroger Hospital is Approved for Accreditation for their Post Graduate Year One (PGY‐1)

 Oak Forest Mail Order Prescription Service Implements Changes to Improve Patient Service 
In  the  latter  part  of  2011,  Oak  Forest  Central  Fill  Pharmacy  began  providing  mail  order  prescription 
services to the patients of Cook County. This additional service offering had a significant impact on the 
pharmacy  staff  and  the  patients  they  served.  Keeping  true  to  the  department’s  vision  of  being 
responsive  to  the  patient’s  needs,  the  pharmacy  management  team  recently  implemented  a  Rapid 
Improvement  Event  to  decrease  turnaround  time  for  mail  order  prescription  processing.  The  changes 
had  a  positive  impact  on  the  mail  order  prescription  service  and  processing  time  for  mail  order 
prescriptions  was  significantly  improved.  Patients  who  utilize  the  mail  order  prescription  service  can 
now expect to receive their prescription within three business days.  Please join us in congratulating the 
pharmacy department on their achievements. 
 
Internal Promotion 
I would like to share the story of one of our new nurses, Ms. Louisa Ford.  Ms. Ford was a Patent Care 
Attendant who has been promoted to a Clinical Nurse.  I would like to acknowledge Ms. Ford’s loyalty to 
the organization and her initiative in pursuing educational opportunities that support the mission of the 
Health  System.  We  are  invested  in  her  success  as  a  professional  Registered  Nurse  and  anticipate  that 
she will continue to grow both personally and professionally with the Cook County Health & Hospitals 
System.  
 
Patient Thank You 
George Talge has been with with Cook County and Stroger Hospital for over forty years.  Dr. Talge was 
initially a technologist, then for many years the Director of the School of Radiologic Technology and for 
the past 10 years the Administrator of CT and MRI.  A stroke patient that has to come to the Radiology 
Department  for  MRIs/CTs  and  occasionally  x‐rays  wrote  that  “each  time  that  they  come  Dr.  Talge  is 
always there to greet patients and he recognizes me.  He is pleasant, and ready to offer help.  He talks to 
me and calms me down before my test.  He assures me that everything will be okay.  He is wonderful, 
very caring and concerned for the patients.  He is an asset to Stroger Hospital.”   We thank Dr. Talge, for 
his  long  time  commitment  to  not    only  the  quality  of  the  care  delivered  but  the  care  with  which  it  is 
delivered.

Transmitting a Communication, dated July 1 1, 2012 from
ANNA ASHCRAFT, Director, Real Estate Management Division

Respectfully requesting approval of a First Amendment to Intergovernmental Agreement between the
County of Cook and the Forest Preserve District of Cook County.

By Resolution the Cook County Board authorized conveyance of land adjacent to the Oak
Forest Health Center Campus to the Forest Preserve District of Cook County (the ?District?), and a joint
planning initiative for the purpose of preserving and memorializing the history of the County?s ownership
of the land, and providing for cooperation in the development of the preserve in harmony with the
continued use of the Oak Forest Health Center Campus (the ?Campus?).

On July 12, 2011, the County Board authorized an Intergovernmental Agreement (the between
Cook County and the District to implement thisjoint planning initiative. Pursuant to the IGA, a consultant
was retained to deveIOp a Master Plan. This Amendment provides for phase 1 of the implementation of
the Master Plan, and public access to the Preserve as early as autumn 2012. Actions authorized are as
follows:

i. The new preserve (the ?Oak Forest Heritage Preserve?) will be accessed through the main
entrance to the Oak Forest Health Center. The District will be permitted to place signage directing visitors
to the Preserve, at locations to be agreed upon by the Cook County Real Estate Management Division in
conjunction with the Cook County Health and Hospitals System 

2. An area For parking on the Campus for District patrons has been agreed upon in conjunction with
This parking may be temporary, depending upon the location of a future visitors center and the
needs of the Health Center.

3. will refrain from mowing certain areas ofthe Campus during the remainder of 20l2 and
during 2013, as necessary, in order to allow regeneration of existing seed banks. If the District determines
that an oak savannah ecosystem will likely regenerate in such areas, the parties will negotiate an
agreement or arrangement for development of such ecosystem.

4. In conjunction with the Real Estate Management Division and the District will work
COOperatively to identify a structure or an area in a structure on the Campus for use as a visitors center,
and to develop a plan for appropriate funding and staffing.

5. The Real Estate Management Division will continue to work with the District and on
phase 2 of the Master Plan planning process.

Fiscal Impact: None

This Amendment was approved by the Cook County Board on July l0, 2012 and will be submitted for
approval by the Forest Preserve District Board of Commissioners at the next available meeting.

Approval recommended.
