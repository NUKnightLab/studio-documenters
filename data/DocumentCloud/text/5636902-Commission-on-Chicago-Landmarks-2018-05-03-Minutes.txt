 MEETING MINUTES
PERMIT REVIEW COMMITTEE
COMMISSION ON CHICAGO LANDMARKS
The Permit Review Committee (PRC) met on May 3, 2018, at 1:45 p.m. The meeting was
held at 121 N. LaSalle St., in Room 201-A.
Present:

James Houlihan

Staff: Dijana Cuvalo

The following projects were reviewed by the PRC:

1. Wood Siding Repair and Replacement Policy
Proposed policy for the repair and replacement of historic wood siding including the
use of cementitious siding in limited circumstances.
Action:

Approved 3-0 (with Commissioners Houlihan and Smith voting “present”)
and recommended that the Commission adopt the policy:
Commission on Chicago Landmarks staff will continue to review the
proposed repair and replacement of historic wood siding per the
Clapboards Guideline adopted in 1992:
Clapboards: Many historic frame buildings are covered by
newer, supposedly maintenance-free, synthetic siding. Hidden
beneath asphalt or asbestos shingles and, more recently, aluminum
or vinyl siding are often the original wood clapboards or shingles,
corner boards, and accompanying trim that are critical features of
frame construction. Often this original material is in good-toexcellent condition, although in need of paint. Original siding
must be retained and repaired rather than replaced with new
material where restoration is feasible. Where original elements
have been removed and replacement is necessary, the size and
proportions of the missing elements must be duplicated. The
outlines of missing pieces can often be deduced from the markings
these materials have left on the underlying sheathing boards, from

 old photographs, or from similar structures in the area which have
retained their original materials.
U. S. Secretary of the Interior’s Standard for Rehabilitation #6, adopted
by the Commission, requires that:
Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than
replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires
replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match
the old in design, color, texture, and other visual qualities and,
where possible, materials.
Substitute Material:
For elevations where non-combustible cladding is mandated to meet
code requirements, smooth-surfaced, fire-resistant siding with a lap
exposure to match historic shall be approved.
For secondary elevations that are minimally visible from
streets/sidewalks within the district, Commission staff may approve
replacement of missing siding or wood siding deteriorated beyond repair
with smooth-surfaced, cementitious siding with a lap exposure to match
historic. For front and highly visible secondary elevations where
original siding is missing or deteriorated beyond repair, Commission
staff shall only approve wood siding to match historic.
Commission staff will take the following factors into consideration when
determining whether a secondary elevation is minimally visible from the
public way:
•
Setback of structure from public way;
•
Setback of structure relative to that of adjacent structures;
•
Distance between structure and adjacent structures; and
•
Any architectural elements on elevations which may
prevent view of the façade located behind (such as bays,
chimneys, changes in plane, etc.).
2. 330 W. Willow
43rd Ward
Old Town Triangle District
Proposed replacement of existing non-historic cladding with new fiber cement
cladding.
Action:

Approved 4-0 (with Commissioner Dziekiewicz voting “present”) with the
following conditions:
1. As proposed, non-historic siding shall be removed from all
elevations of the existing building. Upon removal of the non-historic
siding, Historic Preservation staff shall be notified and make a site
visit to verify if any historic wood siding remains, to review its
condition, and determine if it can be retained and repaired;

 If historic wood siding can be repaired, select areas of deterioration
are to be replaced in kind with wood clapboard to match design, lap
exposure, profile, dimensions, and finish of the existing historic
siding. Should no historic wood siding exist on the front elevation,
new wood clapboard siding shall be installed;
3. Due to minimal visibility of the east and west elevations, fiber
cement siding may be installed on the side and rear elevations,
provided it is smooth finish and maintains a 4” lap exposure to be
consistent with the characteristics of historic wood clapboard;
4. Replacement siding shall be installed in a timely manner to minimize
exposure to the elements and exterior sheathing is to remain intact at
all time. All existing window and door trim, and decorative cornice
elements are to be retained and repaired; and,
5. Product specification details, drawings, and material samples are to
be submitted to Historic Preservation staff for review and approval at
time of permit application.
2.

3. 1114 W. Fulton Market
27th Ward
Fulton-Randolph Market District
Proposed interior and exterior rehabilitation including new windows and storefronts
and new construction of a one-story rooftop addition.
Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. As proposed, the new storefronts shall have a dark, factory applied
finish, with dimensioned details to be submitted with the permit
application;
2. As proposed, as much historic masonry as possible shall be salvaged
from the demolition of the north and partial demolition of the east
facades and reinstalled on the east elevation. Any new masonry
required shall match the size, color, texture, and appearance of the
historic masonry per review by Historic preservation staff on-site
prior to order and installation;
3. A report by a licensed structural engineer addressing the proposed
demolition and construction relative to how the remaining structure
should be braced and protected during the proposed demolition of
the existing floor and roof framing, north elevation, and portion of
the east elevation shall be submitted to Historic Preservation Staff.
The recommended measures, sequencing, and protections shall be
incorporated into the permit drawings. The structural engineer shall
inspect and monitor the project on site during the approved partial
removal as well as during the reconstruction of the walls and the
structure to ensure the facades that remain are property braced and
protected;
4. As proposed, the bricked in windows shall be replaced with new
eight-over-two, double hung, clad-wood windows. Enlarged
window details shall be submitted with the permit plans; and;
5. The cladding material for the rooftop addition shall have a dark
factory-applied finish, and a sample shall be submitted for staff
review and approval prior to order and installation.

 4. 4901 S. Kimbark
4th Ward
Kenwood District
Proposed rehabilitation of a single-family home including new construction of a 1story masonry garage.
Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. Any new wood elements shall be painted or stained; and,
2. As proposed, the new masonry and mortar for the garage shall match
the historic in size, color, profile, texture, and type and shall be
reviewed and approved by Historic Preservation staff prior to order
and installation.

5. 5200 S. Greenwood
5th Ward
Greenwood Row House District
Proposed construction of a new, masonry, detached garage on corner property.
Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. As proposed, the 19’x31’ garage with a recessed panel garage door
at the alley elevation and two windows plus contrasting masonry
course at the street-facing elevation as per drawings submitted to
Historic Preservation staff on April 23. 2018, be approved.
Windows to be wood or clad-wood and muntins to have interior and
exterior grilles and spacer bars. Window details to be submitted
with the permit; and,
2. As proposed, the garage should be clad with Interstate Brick 2 ¼”
modular brick in Ash L-4 color.
