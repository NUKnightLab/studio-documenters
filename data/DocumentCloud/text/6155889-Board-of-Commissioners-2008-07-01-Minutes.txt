PRESIDENT
COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT PROGRAM
Transmitting a Communication, dated June 17, 2008 from
TODD H. STROGER, President, Cook County Board of Commissioners
Re:

Community Block Grant Program, Emergency Shelter Grants Program
and the HOME Investment Partnerships Program

transmitted herewith are the recommended projects for the 2008 Community Development Block Grant
Program (CDBG), the Emergency Shelter Grants Program (ESG), and the proposed use of funds under
the HOME Investment Partnership Program (HOME). The 2008 CDBG Proposed Projects represents the
4th year of the Five Year Consolidated Plan (Plan), which is a Housing and Urban Development (HUD)
mandate, that requires the County to utilize federal dollars in accordance with the strategies outlined in
the Plan. As part of the HUD approved Citizens Participation Plan, the Cook County Community
Development Advisory Council adopted these recommendations at a public hearing held on May 8, 2008.
The amount of CDBG funds requested was $24,039,028. The amount of CDBG funds available for
programming is $10,505,109. The proposed use of CDBG funds will provide 100% benefit to low and
moderate-income persons.

6571

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 1, 2008
The amount of ESG funds requested was $1,014,000. The amount of ESG funds available for
programming is $445,665. The proposed use of ESG funds provides essential services and
maintenance/operations costs for homeless shelters in suburban Cook County, as well as programs for
homeless prevention.
The amount of HOME Investment Partnership funds granted by the U.S. Department of Housing and
Development (HUD) is $5,599,793. Additionally, the County will receive $44,853 for the American
Dream Down Payment Initiative recently announced by HUD. Applications for eligible HOME projects
are accepted throughout the year. The proposed use of all funds must be incorporated into the County’s
Annual Action Plan for submittal to HUD.
Prior to submitting required documents to HUD, Cook County is required, by Executive Order 12372,
Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs, to submit proposed projects to the Northeastern Illinois
Planning Commission and the Illinois State Clearinghouse for their review and release to HUD. The
County must also publish the description of the Annual Action Plan. All documents and certifications
must be submitted to HUD no later than August 15, 2008.
I respectfully request approval of the recommended CDBG and ESG projects, the proposed use of the
HOME funds, and that I, or the Chief, Bureau of Capital, Planning and Facilities Management, or his
designee, be authorized to execute, on behalf of the County of Cook, any and all documents necessary to
further the programs approved herein, including, but not limited to, subrecipient agreements,
intergovernmental agreements, amendments and modifications thereto, loan documents, lien assignments,
releases of mortgages and liens, and mortgage assumptions.
_________________________
Commissioner Maldonado, seconded by Commissioner Steele, moved that the request of the President be
approved. The motion carried unanimously.

Section 1.
To the extent and as required by "An Act regulating wages of laborers, mechanics and
other workers employed in any public works by the State, county, city or any public body or any political
subdivision or by any one under contract for public works," approved June 26, 1941, as amended, the
general prevailing rate of wages in this locality for laborers, mechanics and other workers engaged in the
construction of public works coming under the jurisdiction of this County is hereby ascertained to be the
same as the prevailing rate of wages for construction work in the Cook County area as determined by the
Department of Labor of the State of Illinois as of June 2008, a copy of that determination being submitted
hereto and incorporated herein by reference. As required by said Act, any and all revisions of the
prevailing rate of wages by the Department of Labor of the State of Illinois shall supersede the
Department's June determination and apply to any and all public works construction undertaken by the
County of Cook. The Definition of any terms appearing in this Ordinance which are also used in
aforesaid Act shall be the same as in said Act.
Section 2.
Nothing herein contained shall be construed to apply said general prevailing rate of
wages as herein ascertained to any work or employment except public works construction of this County
to the extent required by the aforesaid Act.
Section 3.
The Bureau of Human Resources shall publicly post or keep available for inspection by
any interested party in the main office of this Bureau of Human Resources (County) this determination or
any revisions of such prevailing rate of wage. A copy of this determination or of the current revised
determination of prevailing rate of wages then in effect shall be attached to all contract specifications.
Section 4.
The Clerk shall mail a copy of this determination to any employer, and to any association
of employers and to any person or association of employees who have filed their names and addresses,
requesting copies of any determination stating the particular rates and the particular class of workers
whose wages will be affected by such rates.
Section 5.
The Bureau of Human Resources shall promptly file a certified copy of this Ordinance
with both the Secretary of State Index Division and the Department of Labor of the State of Illinois.
Section 6.
The Bureau of Human Resources shall cause to be published in a newspaper of general
circulation within the area a copy of this Ordinance, and such publication shall constitute notice that the
determination is effective and that this is the determination of this public body.
Section 7.
The Purchasing Agent of Cook County shall specify in the call for bids in any contract for
public works that the general prevailing rate of wages in the locality for each craft or type of laborer or
mechanic needed to execute the contract to perform such work, also the general prevailing rate for legal
holiday and overtime work as ascertained by the Bureau of Human Resources, shall be paid for each craft
or type of work needed to execute the contract or to perform such work. The Purchasing Agent in
awarding the contract shall cause to be inserted in the contract a stipulation to the effect that not less than
the prevailing rate of wages, as found by the Bureau of Human Resources, shall be paid to all laborers,
workers and mechanics performing work under the contract, and the Purchasing Agent shall also require
in all such contractor's bonds that the contract include such provision as will guarantee the faithful
performance of such prevailing wage clause as provided by the contract.

6573

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 1, 2008
Section 8.
In the case of any underpayment of the prevailing wage, a penalty of 20% of the
underpayment shall be assessed against the contractor or subcontractor; and the 20% penalty shall be
payable to the Illinois Department of Labor. Any underpayment that has not been repaid to a worker
within thirty-days of violation is subject to an additional 2% of the underpayment as a punitive damage
assessment. This is payable to the worker.

have violated the Act on two (2) separate occasions. An affected contractor or subcontractor may request
the Department to hold a hearing on the alleged violations within ten (10) days notification of the second

the following instances: the payment of public utility bills and the payment of rent, pursuant to the
provisions of a lease previously approved by the County Board, payment of insurance premiums,

managerial services of $25,000.00 or more; Examination and tallying of bids. All bids shall be opened
and tallied at a time predetermined by the President, who shall appoint a member of the County Board to
preside and witness the conduct of the reading and announcing in public of all bids before all who desire
to attend. The bids shall then be reported to the County Board at the next meeting after the opening
thereof. If it is evident that only one qualified bid has been submitted with respect to a particular contract,
no bid envelope is opened and any sealed bid(s) shall be returned to the bidder(s) via certified mail
unopened. The Clerk announces this fact and that the Purchasing Agent will thereafter determine whether
to re-issue the solicitation of competitive bids as a result. If it is determined that an error was made in
announcing the bid or there was a failure to read all bids into the record, the Purchasing Agent shall notify
the Commissioner who presided over the Bid Opening and the Clerk of the Board of the need to
reconvene the Bid Opening to correct the record. As soon as reasonably possible, the Bid Opening is

notification of a recommended vendor from the Department and Contract Compliance, the Office of the
Purchasing Agent prepares the pre-award bids report and posts said report on the County's web-site and
on the bulletin board outside the Purchasing Agent's Office. The time intervals required to evaluate bids
are not always predictable. Bidders are responsible for monitoring the web-site or, if they lack web

of the recommended bidder, but no later than three business days after the date upon which the
recommendation for award is posted on the County's web-site and on the Purchasing Agent's bulletin
board. The bid protest must state with specificity the basis upon which the bidder believes that the
recommendation for award is erroneous, or the basis upon which the bidder believes the bid procedure
was unfair, including a statement of how the alleged unfairness prejudiced the protesting bidder. A bidder
who could have submitted a request for exception, clarification or information prior to bid opening but
failed to do so shall not be entitled to protest a bid on the basis of insufficient information or clarity after
the bids have been opened.
(m)

REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON FINANCE
June 24, 2008
The Honorable,
The Board of Commissioners of Cook County
ATTENDANCE
Present:

Chairman Daley, Vice Chairman Sims, Commissioners Butler, Claypool, Collins,
Gorman, Maldonado, Murphy, Peraica, Quigley, Schneider, Silvestri and Suffredin (13)

Absent:

President Stroger and Commissioners Beavers, Goslin, Moreno and Steele (4)

Also Present:

Johnny C. Brown – Chief Operating Officer, Stroger Hospital of Cook County; Patrick
T. Driscoll, Jr. – Deputy State’s Attorney, Chief, Civil Actions Bureau; Sylvia Edwards
– Acting Chief Operating Officer, Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County; Jonathan A.
Rothstein – Acting Chief, Bureau of Human Resources; and Jarese Wilson – Director,
Department of Budget and Management Services

Court Reporter: Anthony W. Lisanti, C.S.R.
Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Committee on Finance of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County met pursuant to notice on
Tuesday, June 24, 2008, at the hour of 10:00 A.M. in the Board Room, Room 569, County Building, 118
North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois, to consider transfers of funds between accounts, as requested by
various departments of County government.
Chairman Daley announced that an agenda has been distributed which outlines the order of consideration
of the transfer of funds.
The Secretary to the Board provided the following corrections and omissions issued by the Department of
Budget and Management Services:
1.

A corrected Open Positions report dated June 16, 2008 was provided to each member of the
Committee on Friday, June 20, 2008. This appears in Volume II, Supplemental Data.

2.

A request for transfer of funds from the Office of the Medical Examiner in the amount of $201,600
should be included in the Bureau of Administration’s requests for transfer of funds over $25,000.
This request was received in time, but was not included in the book in error. Copies of this request
were provided to the members of the Committee on June 23, 2008.

6648

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 1, 2008
3.

As a result of the inclusion of the transfer of funds request by the Office of the Medical Examiner,
the Five Year Transfer History and Summary of Transfers has been amended and has been
distributed to the committee.

Commissioner Quigley made a request that for future transfer of funds meetings, the Commissioners
should receive the Annual Appropriation Bill for that current fiscal year prior to consideration of transfers
of funds. Additionally, he questioned the absence of funds transfer requests from Stroger Hospital of
Cook County. An examination of a recent trial balance indicated that Stroger Hospital might need to
request transfers of funds, as some accounts indicated shortfalls.
Chairman Daley pointed out that the date for this transfer of funds meeting was chosen by the Budget
Department. He asked Jarese Wilson, Director of the Department of Budget and Management Services,
to address Commissioner Quigley’s questions.
Ms. Wilson stated that the Appropriation Bill was nearing completion and she expects that it will be
received soon.
With regard to Stroger Hospital of Cook County, Ms. Wilson explained that the accounts indicating
shortfalls were actually the result of accounting errors in which the wrong accounts were charged. These
errors would be corrected internally with charge-backs, a corrective accounting procedure. David R.
Small, Chief Operating Officer of the Bureau of Health Services has explained this in a letter, and
indicated that they would not be in need of transfers of funds at this time.
Johnny C. Brown, Chief Operating Officer of Stroger Hospital of Cook County, confirmed Ms. Wilson’s
explanation. Due to the delay in the Fiscal Year 2008 Budget passage and the creation of new business
units in the Office of the Chief Health Administrator, purchases were expended against the existing units
within Stroger Hospital of Cook County’s account (Department 897). There are sufficient funds available
in the Office of the Chief Health Administrator account (Department 890) and the Fixed Charges and
Special Purpose Appropriations – Health (Department 899) for the required charge-backs.
Chairman Daley requested that the letter from Mr. Small be included as part of the record.
(070108journalemail).
Commissioner Suffredin asked Ms. Wilson to explain how the requesting departments could get current
data on which to base their requests if the Appropriation Bill is not yet available.
Ms. Wilson responded that the departments use the One World System, which links them to the same
information as that available on the Trial Balance. She stated that she was confident that the requests
accurately reflected what was contained in the Appropriation Bill.
Commissioner Schneider questioned the inclusion of a previous transfer of funds for his office that was
included in the back up materials for the meeting.
Ms. Wilson stated that her directive was to include all transfer of funds that occurred in Fiscal Year 2008,
which is the reason for the inclusion of the transfer totaling $32,345, approved by the Board on December
4, 2007.
After further review, it was determined that although Commissioner Schneider’s transfer of funds
occurred in Fiscal Year 2008, the transfer did not involve Fiscal Year 2008 dollars.
Commissioner Schneider, seconded by Commissioner Gorman, moved to amend Volume II Supplemental Data, to remove Commissioner Schneider’s Fiscal Year 2007 transfer of funds in the
amount of $32,345.00 from the backup materials. The motion carried unanimously.

requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to amend and renew Contract No. 07-45-363 with

Reason:

software applications from the contract that are no longer required.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $6,510,382.72 (FY 2008: $3,255,191.36; and FY 2009: $3,255,191.36).

The quantities as shown on the contract documents were estimated for bidding purposes only. This
change represents the difference between the estimated quantities and actual field quantities of work
performed with a substantial savings due less bituminous surface area being removed and consequently
less Hot-Mix-Asphalt Binder and Surface Courses being required.

to lower the elevation of the frame.
I respectfully recommend approval by your Honorable Body.

Supplemental Improvement Resolution
Reconstruction of the existing pavement, etc.
Walters Avenue,
Waukegan Road to Lee Road
in the Village of Northbrook in County Board District #14
Section: 04-A7322-03-FP
Fiscal Impact: $2,500,000.00 from the Motor Fuel Tax Fund (600-600 Account)
On May 4, 2004, your Honorable Body approved an Improvement Resolution appropriating $700,000.00
towards completion of this roadway reconstruction project, concurrently with an Improvement Resolution
appropriating $1,225,000.00 towards a similar project along Lee Road from Walters Avenue to Dundee
Road. At the time these Resolutions were processed, the Department was intent upon transferring
jurisdiction of these two (2) roadway segments to the Village of Northbrook following completion of the
improvements, originally anticipated in the fall of 2005. During plan preparation, for ease of accounting
and construction efficiencies, improvements along these two (2) roadways were combined for letting as
one construction contract. Additional funding is required due to expansion of the improvement scope to
include ditch regarding, erosion control, sidewalk removal and replacement and tree removal and
replacement as requested by the Village of Northbrook.

APPROVAL OF PAYMENT
Transmitting a Communication, dated June 25, 2008 from
SIDNEY A. THOMAS, Chief Operating Officer, Provident Hospital of Cook County
requesting approval of payment in the amount of $208,800.00 to Nighthawk Radiology Services, Coeur
d’Alene, Idaho, for Tele-Radiology Services for review, analysis and diagnosis of patient radiographic
films. The contractor provided 24 hour service coverage to assist hospital physicians to meet patient
demand. The service was performed pending the evaluation and award of the annual Request for
Proposal (RFP) (Proposal 08-50-1035P, opened 5/30/08) for this service.
Reason:

The service was necessary due to the need to continue to provide critical radiology services at
the hospital for in-patients, out-patients and emergency room patients in a safe environment
due to the abrupt resignation of three (3) of the four (4) radiologists at Provident Hospital of
Cook County. This payment is necessary due to secondary to a delay in execution of the
contract approved on the May 15, 2007 Board Agenda, negotiations on language in the
contract between the vendor and the States Attorney’s Office, and a further delay in
completion of the RFP process. RFP proposals have been received and evaluated and a
vendor will be selected and submitted to the Purchasing Agent for inclusion on the July 22,
2008 Board Agenda.

OFFICE OF THE RECORDER OF DEEDS
CONTRACT ADDENDUM
The following item was deferred, as amended at the June 17, 2008 Board Meeting:
Transmitting a Communication from
EUGENE “GENE” MOORE, Recorder of Deeds
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to increase by $589,875.00, Contract No. 06-41-694
with AMCAD, LLC, Herndon, Virginia, for conversion of back file microfilm.
Board approved amount 06-06-06:
Decrease approved 11-20-07:
This increase requested:
Adjusted amount:
Reason:

$1,966,250.00
(589,875.00)
589,875.00
$2,556,125.00 $1,966,250.00

The Recorder of Deeds Office wants to correct the amount so as to accurately reflect the dollar
amount. The incorrect language that appeared in the fourth (4th) amendment of contract
should not have resulted in a decrease of $589,875.00. The intention was to reference the 5th
and final payment amount of the contract. The deleted amount of $589,875.00 must be
restored, in order to ensure full implementation of the contract pursuant to the revised contract
agreement.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $589,875.00. (527-579 Account).
Sufficient funds are available in the County Recorder Document Storage System Fund.
