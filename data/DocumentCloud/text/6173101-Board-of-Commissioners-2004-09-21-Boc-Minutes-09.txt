The Chairperson thereupon declared said Motion carried and said Resolution adopted.
Commissioner Nesbitt, Chairperson of the Finance & Audit Committee, presented the monthly
report. Per Commissioner Nesbitt, the Finance & Audit Committee meeting was held on
Wednesday, September 15, 2004, at the 626 Corporate Office and the Chief Financial Officer
and his staff presented the Committee with the Treasury and Cash Flow Report as of August 31,
2004.
Commissioner Nesbitt then introduced an Omnibus Motion for adoption of the resolutions for
Item A1 thru A5 discussed, voted and recommended for Board approval by the Finance and
Audit Committee.
(Item A1)
The resolution for Item A1 amends Resolution No. 99-CHA-91 which established the Board of
Commissioners Committee due to the revision of the Illinois Housing Authorities Act, that
established that one Resident Commissioner who is appointed to the Board be an Officer or
Official of a Tenant Association.
RESOLUTION NO: 2004-CHA-109
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the
recommendation dated September 9, 2004 titled “Authorization to approve the
Amended Board of Commissioners Committee Structure”;
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has determined that this Resolution shall revise prior
Resolution No. 99-CHA-91 establishing the Board of Commissioners Committee
structure solely for the purpose of providing for the Resident Commissioner
selected to the Board by virtue of such persons status as an officer of a Tenant
Organization being an ex-officio member of the Finance & Audit Committee and
the Operations and Facilities Committee and a regular member of the Tenant
Services Committee;
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has determined that this Resolution, taken in its
entirety, shall effectively supersede Resolution No. 99-CHA-91.
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners hereby adopts this Resolution which is deemed to
supersede Resolution No. 99-CHA-91 in its entirety.

5

 THAT,

the Board of Commissioners hereby provides for and establishes three
Committees of the Board of Commissioners with the titles and responsibilities as
follows:
1.

2.

3.

Finance & Audit: the consideration of all matters related to the revenues
and outlays of the Authority, including all purchases and contracts, and the
policies and procedures related thereto.
Operations & Facilities: the consideration of all matters related to the
operation, maintenance, and repair of facilities, and the redevelopment,
modernization, demolition and replacement of facilities, and the policies
and procedures related thereto.
Tenant Services: the consideration of matters related directly to the social
and personal well being of residents, including tenant selection and
retention, security, youth programs, elderly programs, employment
training and readiness programs and other economic development issues.

THAT,

each committee may meet, when deemed necessary, prior to the monthly meeting
of the full Board of Commissioners to consider issues pertinent to such
Committee.

THAT,

each Committee shall establish annually a calendar of its regular meetings for the
next twelve months and that the Committee Chair, Chairman, or any two
Committee members may call a special meeting upon 48 hours prior notice.

THAT,

each Committee will report to the Board of Commissioners at its monthly meeting
and at any other Board meetings where the Board of Commissioners is
considering a determination or other action for the areas of responsibility of such
Committee.

THAT,

the Chairman and Vice Chairman shall be ex-officio voting members of each
Committee, but shall not be counted present for purposes of establishing a
quorum of such Committee.

THAT,

the Resident Commissioner who has been appointed to the Board by virtue of
being an Officer or Official of a Tenant Association, shall be designated as an exofficio voting member of both the Finance & Audit Committee and the
Operations & Facilities Committee, but shall not be counted present for purposes
of establishing a quorum of either Committee and a regular member of the Tenant
Services Committee;

THAT,

in addition to ex-officio members, each Committee shall consist of five
Commissioners who shall be appointed by the Chairman annually, with one being
designated as Committee Chair, provided that no one Commissioner shall be
appointed to more than two Committees, and that a majority of such
Commissioners appointed to a Committee must be present to establish a quorum
necessary for a meeting of such Committee.

THAT,

any vacancy on a Committee created by a vacancy in any Commissioner’s office
shall be filled by the person succeeding to such Commissioner’s Office.

(Item A2)
The resolution for Item A2 approves clarification of certain provisions of the employees’
Retirement Plan regarding beneficiaries and the distribution of benefits upon the death of a
participant, and to similarly relate these Plan provisions to certain benefits of the 1994 Voluntary
Early Retirement Plan by adding language by reference to certain provisions of the Plan.
RESOLUTION NO. 2004-CHA-110
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed Board Letter dated August 23, 2004,
entitled “Authorization to Amend the Chicago Housing Authority Employees’
Retirement Plan and Trust”;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY

6

 THAT

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to execute Amendment Nine to the Chicago Housing Authority
Employees’ Retirement Plan and Trust in the form and as of the effective dates
indicated in the attached Amendment.

(Item A3)
The CHA must annually renew its insurance coverage and HUD previously authorized the CHA
to have its Insurance Broker of Record (Mesirow) to competitively solicit bids on the CHA’s
behalf for all forthcoming insurance procurements. Accordingly, Mesirow advertised an
Invitation for Bid (IFB) for the CHA's insurance required coverage in the Chicago Tribune. In
addition, Mesirow directly solicited 37 insurers and 2 wholesalers. In response to the IFB, 1 bid
for each line of insurance coverage and 46 declinations were received. After reviewing the
responses, Mesirow and CHA’s Risk Management Department recommend the firms listed in the
approved Resolution below, to provide the required insurance coverage for CHA for the period
of October 1, 2004 through September 30, 2005. A quote for an additional $25 million in
Excess Property insurance was obtained from RSUI Indemnity to ensure sufficient coverage for
the Authority’s portfolio. Despite advertising an aggressive direct solicitation by Mesirow, bids
were only received from the incumbent carriers though; some of those carriers were able to provide
alternative retention level and coverage limit options.

RESOLUTION NO. 2004-CHA-111
WHEREAS, The Board of Commissioners has reviewed the memorandum dated August 27,
2004, entitled "Authorization for the CHA to award General Liability, Public
Officials Liability, Employment Practices Liability, Auto Liability, Excess
Liability, Property, Excess Property and Boiler and Machinery Insurance
Coverage";
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to award the following insurance coverage for the CHA for the period of
October 1, 2004 through September 30, 2005 for an aggregate amount not-toexceed $1,381,626 through its insurance broker of record, Mesirow Insurance
Services, Inc.: (1) General Liability and Excess Liability insurance coverage
written through AIG in an amount not-to-exceed $211,233; (2) Public Officials
Liability and Employment Practices Liability written through AIG in an amount
not-to-exceed $257,106; (3) Property and Excess Property Insurance written
through AIG and RSUI Indemnity in an amount not-to-exceed $739,570; (4)
Excess Property (DIC) Insurance written through Royal Indemnity in an amount
not-to-exceed $45,000; (5) Boiler & Machinery written through Travelers
Insurance in an amount not-to-exceed $58,646; and (6) Auto Liability written
through HARRG in an amount not-to-exceed $70,071.

(Item A4)
In March 2000, the Board of Commissioners approved award of contract to SBC for
Telecommunication Services which included CityNet, pagers, cellular phones and phone lines
for the Authority. In a series of subsequent meetings between the CHA and SBC, it was
determined that it would be in the best interest of the Authority to separately procure its
telecommunication needs rather than have them packaged under one procurement. It was also
determined that a significant price savings could be experienced by the Authority if a cooperative
purchase could be made with the City of Chicago, since the CityNet services for the CHA and
the City are similar. Accordingly, the resolution for Item A4 approves entering into a contract
with SBC for CityNet Telecommunication Services under a Cooperative Purchasing
Arrangement with the City of Chicago.
RESOLUTION NO. 2004-CHA-112
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated August 25,
2004, entitled “Authorization to enter into a contract with SBC for CityNet
Telecommunication Services under a Cooperative Purchasing Arrangement with
the City of Chicago”.
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners hereby authorize the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to enter into a contract with SBC for Citynet Telecommunications
Services, pursuant to and in association with a cooperative purchasing
7

 arrangement to be reached with the City of Chicago and that agreement dated as
of December 22nd 2003 (Contract No. 71901) between the City of Chicago and
SBC (the “Cooperative Purchasing Arrangement”), at a Not-to-Exceed price of
$2,400,000.00 for a contract term of 24 months, including an option to extend the
contract term for an additional one (1) year term at the election of the CHA at a
Not-to-Exceed price of $1,200,000.00 for the one (1) year option term.
(Item A5)
In April of 2003 the Board of Commissioners authorized the acceptance of a $310,000 Grant
from the MacArthur Foundation for Urban Planning efforts at Altgeld Gardens, LeClaire Courts
and Lathrop Homes. To date, Lakota Group (Altgeld Gardens), URS Corporation (LeClaire
Courts), and Capraro Consulting Services (all three sites) have been contracted to provide these
services, and planning is under way for two of the three proposed sites. The Resolution for Item
A5 approves an amendment that would allow the continuation of the planning stage at all three
developments. Specifically, this grant will assess what resources currently exist in each
community; identify what resources should exist; and provide leadership training for residents
focuses on ending their historic isolation and connecting them to other community stakeholders.
This amendment will allow for the final Planner for Lathrop Homes which, has yet to be
identified, to be obtained from the City of Chicago’s Department of Planning and Development
Planning NOW program.
RESOLUTION NO. 2004-CHA-113
WHEREAS the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated September 21,
2004, requesting authorization to amend Board Letter Resolution 2003-CHA-60,
reallocating grant funds from Grant Award #03-76897-000-HCD from John D.
and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY:
THAT

The Board of Commissioners approves amending Board letter 2003-CHA-60 to
reallocate funds from the MacArthur Foundation in an amount not to exceed
$310,000 to continue to support the development of strategic community plans
and provide resident leadership for LeClaire Courts, Altgeld Gardens and Lathrop
Homes.

THAT

The Board of Commissioners further authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to enter into sub-grantee agreements with identified partners in the grant
application, specifically the City of Chicago’s Department of Planning and
Development Planning NOW program and Jim Capraro, a private community
development consultant. Sub-grant agreements are not to exceed the following
amounts: NOW: $298,000 and Jim Capraro - $12,000.

There being no questions or discussion, the Chairperson thereupon declared said Motion carried
and said resolutions adopted. The Finance and Audit Committee report was also accepted in
total.
Commissioner Gates, Chairperson of the Operations & Facilities Committee, then presented the
monthly report. Per Commissioner Gates, the Operations & Facilities Committee met on
Wednesday, September 15, 2004, at the 626 Corporate Offices. Richard Rodriguez, Managing
Director, and staff presented the Committee with an update on Westhaven Management issues.

8

 Commissioner Gates then introduced an Omnibus Motion for adoption of resolutions for Items
B1 through B6, discussed, voted and recommended for Board approval by the Operations and
Facilities Committee.

(Item B1)
The CHA’s construction program under the Plan for Transformation utilizes the Owner’s
Representatives (OR) to oversee the rehabilitation of senior and family housing units. The CHA
uses the services of the OR firms in the Scattered Sites and Make Ready programs to ensure that
the CHA’s architects and general contractors are performing their work in a skilled manner, and
to ensure that the work is on time and on budget. Accordingly, a Request for Proposal was
advertised in area newspapers. Twelve (12) proposals were received and an Evaluation
Committee consisting of staff members chosen from the Capital Construction Division (CCD)
reviewed and scored the written proposals. Seven (7) Respondents were found to be in the
competitive range established. Each of the seven Respondents made a presentation before the
Evaluation Committee and submitted a best and final offer. Upon further consideration of each
Respondent’s qualifications, the Evaluation Committee recommended that the CHA award
contracts to two (2) firms. Accordingly, the resolution for Item B1 approves award of contract
for OR services to D’Escoto Inc., and Globetrotters Engineering.
Commissioner Ponce recused from voting on Item B1.
RESOLUTION NO. 2004-CHA-114
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed Board Letter dated August 23, 2004,
entitled “Authorization to execute contracts with D’Escoto, Inc. and Globetrotters
Engineering Corporation for Owner’s Representative Services for the Scattered
Sites and Make Ready Programs”;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to execute contracts for Owner’s Representative Services with d’Escoto,
Inc. in the amount of $1,311,132.67 and with Globetrotters Engineering
Corporation in the amount of $729,600.00. d’Escoto will provide Owner’s
Representative Services for the Scattered Sites Program and Globetrotters
Engineering Corporation will provide Owner’s Representative Services for the
Make Ready Program. The contracts shall take effect on the dates of the
individual Notices to Proceed, and shall continue until the end dates indicated in
the individual contracts, subject to each Contractor’s compliance with the CHA’s
M/W/DBE, Section 3 resident hiring, and insurance requirements.

(Item B2)
In 2002 the CHA entered into a contract to install air conditioning units at various Senior
buildings. The contractor utilized a licensed minority electrical subcontractor to complete the
electrical work. However, the subcontractor made errors in wiring, phasing and polarity, and
installed certain electrical equipment without the proper consent of the CHA. In late 2002, the
errors were discovered by the general contractor and reported to CHA. At approximately the
same time, inspectors from the City of Chicago Building Department also observed the problems
and the building failed the inspection. Since CHA did not know the full extent of the electrical
problems Jolen, an impartial electrical contractor, was hired, through a competitive bidding
process to perform a complete assessment of the buildings. Upon completion of the assessment,
Jolen was granted approval to expand the Scope of Work to include the repair of five buildings.
Accordingly, the resolution for Item B2 approves a total cost of $184,820 to cover labor and
material to perform polarity testing and the subsequent assessment and electrical repairs of five
buildings.
RESOLUTION NO. 2004-CHA-115
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed Board Letter dated August 19, 2004,
entitled “Ratification of Amendment to Purchase Order No. 37200 issued to Jolen
Electric Communications to increase funding and expand the scope of work, and
ratification of completed repair work”;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
9

 THAT

the Board of Commissioners ratifies the amendment of Purchase Order No. 37200
issued to Jolen Electric Communications to increase its funding by $94,130.00
and expand the Scope of Work to include electrical repair work, and ratifies the
use of funds from Purchase Order No. 37200 for electrical repair work completed
at 4945 N. Sheridan and 5670 W. Lake. The new total value of Purchase Order
No. 37200 will be $184,820.00

(Item B3)
In August 2003, the Board approved a contract award to Smith Harding Joint Venture for Prime
Design Consultant Services at Harrison Courts, Ogden Courts, Loomis Courts and Lathrop
Elderly for a fee of $1,483,000.00. To meet HUD requirements with regards to the financing, a
more comprehensive assessment of the properties needed to be completed. In light of the
substantial increase in construction cost required for the expanded work scope and the substantial
additional services required of the PDC, an equitable adjustment to the original fee was required.
Accordingly, the resolution for Item B3 approves $1,227,448 negotiated to provide an equitable
adjustment for an increase in the construction administration and closeout costs, necessitated by
the need to meet the more extensive requirements of the application for HUD mortgage funding;
an allowance for reimbursable costs that were not included in the original authorized funding
amount; compensate for increased PDC costs caused by the need to accelerate the creation of the
construction documents to meet shortened deadlines imposed by the HUD firm application
process; provide an equitable adjustment for the increased cost of construction for completed
schematic design work and revise the total fee due to the decision to drop Ogden Courts from the
scope of Work after the schematic designs had been completed and for the completed work on
the separate procurement solicitation for windows and tuck pointing that was cancelled after an
Awardee had been chosen.
RESOLUTION NO. 2004-CHA-116
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed Board Letter dated September 9, 2004,
entitled “Authorization to increase funding for Smith-Harding Joint Venture
Prime Design Consultant Services at Harrison Courts, Lathrop Elderly and
Loomis Courts and for completed Prime Design Consultant Services at Ogden
Courts”;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to increase the funding for Smith-Harding Joint Venture in the amount
of $1,227,488.00 for Prime Design Consultant (“PDC”) services at Harrison
Courts, Lathrop Elderly and Loomis Courts, and completed design work for
Ogden Courts, including the separate procurement solicitation for windows and
tuck pointing, subject to the Contractor’s compliance with the CHA’s
MBE/WBE/DBE, Section 3 resident hiring, and insurance requirements. The new
total funding will be $2,710,488.00.

(Item B4)
The Resolution for Item B4 approves submission of a Mixed Finance Proposal and Disposition
Application to HUD for the redevelopment of Horner Phase IIa2. The Brinshore-Michaels
Development Team was selected as the result of a Request for Qualifications issued by the City
of Chicago’s Department of Housing on behalf of the CHA and the court-appointed Receiver,
and the Habitat Company LLC. Phase IIa2 will consist of constructing eight homeownership
buildings with a total of 173 units. The Phase IIa2 Homeownership Development Site is located
on a portion of each of the two CHA-owned parcels that comprise the total Phase II Site. These
units will be scattered among the rental buildings currently under construction in Phase IIa1 of
this redevelopment effort. The Low-Rise homeownership portion consists of 60 affordable and
market-rate for-sale units contained in seven 3 and 4 story walk-up buildings. The developer of
the Low-Rise Development is WHP Homes, LLC. The Mid-Rise building will consist of 113
units of which 34 are public housing and 79 are for-sale homeownership units of which 7 units
will be reserved for households under 100% of AMI. The remaining 72 units will be unrestricted
market rate. There will be 141 indoor parking spaces with the 34 public housing and affordable
units being assigned one space per unit. There will be a management office, community room,
meeting room, fitness center, individual storage lockers, central heat and AC, washer/dryer hookups in each unit, balconies or patios, security cameras and part-time doorman service. The
expected cost of the WHP Mid-Rise is $30,406,434 and will be financed through a mix of public
and private sources. The total costs associated with the non-public housing units will be
financed with a construction loan from Citibank in the approximate amount of $14,081,403.
The initial property manager will be Interstate Realty Management, an affiliate of the developer.

 RESOLUTION NO. 2004-CHA-117
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board letter dated August 10, 2004
requesting authorization to submit a Mixed-Finance Proposal and Disposition
Application to HUD for the redevelopment of Henry Horner Homes Phase IIa2
and to execute ground leases and other documents as necessary to implement the
foregoing;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY:
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners hereby authorizes the Chief Executive Officer, or his
designee, to submit a Mixed-Finance Proposal, Disposition Application, and
evidentiaries to HUD, to enter into For-Sale Ground Leases for the WHP-Midrise
and Low-Rise Developments, and to execute such documents and take such
actions as may be necessary to submit the property to the Illinois Condominium
Property Act for Phase IIa2 of the mixed-finance redevelopment of Henry Horner
Homes; and

THAT,

the Board of Commissioners hereby authorizes the Chief Executive Officer, or his
designee, to execute, deliver and perform HOPE VI and Gautreaux Fund Loan
agreement(s) with WHP Tower, LLC (such loans to be assumed by and/or
refinanced with WHP Tower Rental, LLC, upon its purchase of the thirty-four
public housing units) and to pay other associated expenses in a total amount not to
exceed $3,914,878. Such loan(s) shall bear interest prior to maturity at a rate not
to exceed the applicable federal rate, and secured by a subordinate leasehold
mortgage on the WHP Mid-rise or the public housing units contained therein; and

THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer, or his
designee, to enter into such further agreements, certificates or other documents
and take such actions as may be necessary or advisable to secure CHA’s interests
or effect the Mixed-Finance Proposal and the foregoing transactions, including
but not limited to loan documents and security instruments, a Regulatory and
Operating Agreement, releases or partial releases, intercreditor agreements,
Declarations of Restrictive Covenants and amendments thereto, ACC
amendment(s), Property Rights Agreements and escrow agreements; and

THAT,

the Board of Commissioners delegates to the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee the power to approve any final changes to the forms of the documents
authorized to be submitted herewith, the execution thereof to constitute
conclusive evidence of their approval hereby, and ratifies any prior submissions to
HUD.

(Item B5)
The Brinshore-Michaels development team was the successful respondent to CHA’s solicitation
for the redevelopment of the Henry Horner Homes. Brinshore-Michaels development team has
contracted with McShane as the General Contractor for the Phase IIa2 Mid-Rise Development.
The engineered barrier approach to remediation involves construction elements to be performed
post-closing that are inseparable from construction and, therefore, is justification to enter into
this contract with McShane. Various benefits to the project will be realized by entering into a
contract for remediation activities with McShane. The benefits namely are (1) continuity of
schedule; (2) continuity of activity and (3) economy of scale. Accordingly, the resolution for
Item B5 approves award of contract to McShane Construction for Environmental Remediation
Activities.

11

 Brinshore-Michaels Development Team’s implementation of the HUD approved
Revitalization Plan at the Henry Horner Homes Development Site”;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY:
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to enter into a contract with McShane Construction Corporation for
environmental remediation activities at the Henry Horner Homes (“Westhaven
Park”) Phase IIa2 Mid-Rise Development Site for a total contract amount not to
exceed $1,156,738 (225% of the estimated remediation costs), subject to any
necessary HUD approvals. The term of the contract shall be the earlier of: the
receipt of a “No Further Remediation” letter from the IEPA with regard to the
Phase IIa2 Mid-Rise Development Site, or two years, subject to a one year

(Item B6)
The Brinshore-Michaels’ development team was the successful respondent to CHA’s solicitation
for the redevelopment of the Henry Horner Homes. The Brinshore-Michaels development team
has contracted with New England as the General Contractor for the Low-Rise Development.
Various benefits to the project will be realized by entering into a contract for remediation
activities with New England. The engineered barrier approach to remediation involves
construction elements to be performed post-closing that are inseparable from construction and
therefore, is justification to enter into this contract with New England. The benefits namely are
(1) continuity of schedule; (2) continuity of activity and (3) economy of scale. Accordingly, the
resolution for Item B5 approves award of contract to New England Builders for Environmental
Remediation Activities.
RESOLUTION NO. 2004-CHA-119

at the Henry Horner Homes Redevelopment Site”;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY

 There being no questions or discussion, the Chairperson thereupon declared said Motion carried
and said resolutions adopted. The Operations and Facilities Committee report was also accepted
in total.
Commissioner Young, Chairperson of the Tenant Services Committee, then presented her
monthly report. Per Commissioner Young, the Tenant Services Committee held its regularly
scheduled meeting on Wednesday, September 15, 2004 at the 626 Corporate Offices. Meghan
Harte, Managing Director of Resident Services, and representatives from TASC presented the
Committee with an update on Social Services at Westhaven, for Phase II.
Commissioner Young then introduced an Omnibus Motion for the adoption of Resolutions for
Items C1 through C5 discussed, voted and recommended for Board approval by the Tenant
Services Committee.
(Item C1)
The resolution for Item C1 approves the Minimum Tenant Selection Plan MTSP. The MTSP is
intended to guide the development of the site specific criteria for mixed-income/mixed-finance
communities. It outlines the minimum tenant screening criteria that CHA residents and other
individuals who apply for rental units must meet to live in any of the CHA’s mixedincome/mixed-finance communities. To produce the MTSP, the CHA identified the critical
issues that need to be included and addressed in all future tenant selection plans (TSPs), such as
employment requirements and criminal background and credit checks. The CHA established the
minimum standards for these criteria by culling best practices from TSPs previously approved
and submitted to HUD. The MTSP, in and of itself, is not an admissions and occupancy policy.
Rather, it articulates the basic standards that need to be adopted at the various mixedincome/mixed-finance developments. Site specific leases, tenant selection plans, and screening
criteria will continue to be developed via the working group process and will be subject to the
notice, publication, and public comment provisions of the Federal regulations. The CHA has met
with the Central Advisory Council Executive Board, the entire Central Advisory Council
(“CAC”), and the CAC’s legal representatives to discuss the MTSP. The MTSP was published
for public comment in June 2004 and a public hearing was held on June 29, 2004. The CHA
amended the MTSP in response to comments received from the Central Advisory Council and
other interested parties.
RESOLUTION 2004-CHA-120
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated September 7,
2004, entitled “Authorization for approval of the Minimum Tenant Selection Plan
for Mixed-Income/Mixed-Finance Communities.”
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners hereby approves the Minimum Tenant Selection
Plan for Mixed-Income/Mixed-Finance Communities and authorizes the Chief
Executive Officer or his designee to approve the Minimum Tenant Selection Plan
for Mixed-Income/Mixed-Finance Communities.

(Item C2)
Upon execution of the Latino Consent Decree, the CHA procured and selected Spanish Coalition
for Housing (SCH) to operate the two required site offices, as well as to perform a specific
marketing and outreach initiative at the inception of the Consent Decree. Since then, SCH has
continued to operate the two CHA Latino Site Offices. In 1999, the CHA exceeded the
requirements of the Consent Decree by opening a third site office in the area of South East
Chicago, also operated by SCH, to serve the large Latino population in that community. Due to
the expiration of SCH’s contract, a Request for Proposals for providing marketing, intake and
outreach services of CHA’s programs to the Latino population was advertised in area
newspapers. In addition, 17 firms were directly solicited, including 7 MBE/WBE/DBE firms.
The Evaluation Committee reviewed the proposal and after an oral presentation and Best and
Final Offer, recommended award of contract to SCH. Accordingly, the Resolution for Item C2
approves award of contract to SCH.
RESOLUTION NO. 2004-CHA-121
WHEREAS, The Board of Commissioners has reviewed the memorandum dated August 31,
2004, titled “Authorization to enter into a contract with Spanish Coalition for
Housing for Marketing, Outreach and Intake Services to the Latino population for
CHA’s Programs”;
13

 THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners hereby authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to enter into a contract with Spanish Coalition for Housing for a twentyfour month base term with 3 one-year option extensions in an amount not-toexceed $977,396.00 for the base term to operate the CHA’s Latino Site Offices
and to conduct marketing and outreach activities to inform the Latino community
about CHA’s programs and housing opportunities.

(Item C3)
Pursuant to the Regulations of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development the
resident councils are required to use an independent third-party to oversee resident elections. The
CHA worked on behalf of the Central Advisory Council (CAC) and Local Advisory Council
(LAC) to procure such independent third-party to oversee the LAC election scheduled for
November 2004 and the CAC elections scheduled for December 2004.
An RFP for the
CAC/LAC Election was released on May 14, 2004. The RFP was advertised in area newspapers
and was also mailed to seven prospective bidders. Four firms picked up copies of the RFP. As
a result of the process, inadequate competition occurred, due the fact the no bids were received
on time. Therefore, this procurement was cancelled and it was decided to proceed with this
service by means of a non-competitive procurement. Accordingly, the resolution for Item C3
approves award of contract to Black United Fund of Illinois.
RESOLUTION NO. 2004-CHA-122
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated July 22, 2004,
requesting authorization to ratify a contract with Black United Fund of Illinois for
conducting and managing the CAC/LAC Elections on behalf of the Central
Advisory Council (CAC).
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to ratify a contract with Black United Fund of Illinois for conducting
and managing of the CAC/LAC Elections on behalf of the CAC not to exceed
$407,374.00.

(Item C4)
In January 2001, the CHA entered into a two year sub-grant agreement with the Board of
Education to implement the Program at ABLA Homes, as part of HUD’s Drug Elimination Grant
Program (PHDEP). The PHDEP Program ended on May 18, 2003, eliminating that funding
source for future funding; the CHA, however, utilized 1996 Hope VI funds to continue the
program through December 31, 2003. The resolution for Item C4 approves an Intergovernmental
Agreement with the City of Chicago Board of Education for the Employability Plus Program.
The new IGA will provide funding for Program operations through the end of the 2005 academic
school year, and will contain a provision for four 1-year extension options at the CHA’s sole
discretion. The Employability Plus program provides a high school reentry program which
allows eligible residents the opportunity to return to high school in order to receive their
diploma. Additionally, there is a GED program for residents who are not able to return to high
school. As a second component to the program, residents participate in job training where they
learn skills in trades such as carpentry, masonry, plumbing, electricity and painting. Participants
also attend workshops in the following areas: Educational Public Health on HIV/AIDS, drug
abuse and Public Assistance legislation. This program is essential to the ABLA community, and
supports the CHA’s Plan for Transformation to link families with opportunities that will assist
their move toward self-sufficiency and integration into mixed-income communities.
RESOLUTION NO. 2004-CHA-123
WHEREAS, The Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the
Board Letter dated September 2, 2004, entitled “Authorization to enter into an
Intergovernmental Agreement with the City of Chicago Board of Education for
the Employability Plus Program at the ABLA Development”;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to execute an intergovernmental agreement with the City of Chicago
Board of Education for the period of January 1, 2004 through June 30, 2005 in an
amount not-to-exceed $141,300.00 for the Employability Plus program at ABLA
14

 Development, which links families with training programs to assist their move
toward self-sufficiency and integration into mixed-income communities.
(Item C5)
CHA redevelopment has made it necessary, from time to time, to relocate public housing or
subsidized housing families. CHA is working to generate stability for families relocated during
the school year by providing for the transportation needs of CHA residents’ children. CHA will
pay for transportation services for CHA children who wish to continue their education at the
school within the attendance area in which a child/student lived before moving due to CHA
redevelopment (“School of Origin”) until the end of the academic year in which the child/student
moved. Accordingly, the resolution for Item C5 approves an Intergovernmental Agreement with
the Board of Education to provide transportation. The Board of Education, in its normal course
of business, provides transportation within an attendance area of a school for children/students
living a certain distance from the school. Additionally, under the auspices of the Homeless
Education Program (HEP), the Board of ED provides transportation to homeless children who
have relocated outside of the attendance area because of their homelessness, but wish to return to
their School of Origin.
RESOLUTION NO. 2004-CHA-124
WHEREAS, The Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated August 30,
2004, titled “Authorization to enter into an Intergovernmental Agreement with the
City of Chicago Board of Education for Transportation Services ”;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

The Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to enter into an Intergovernmental Agreement with the City of Chicago
Board of Education for a twelve (12) month term scheduled effective October 1,
2004 to implement a transportation program for children in families relocating
under the Plan for Transformation to return to their school of origin for the
2004/2005 academic school year in an amount not-to-exceed $75,000.00
