Bringing to the attention of the Board, the Fund has a widow who has filed an application for a
surviving spouse’s annuity. Her husband was a Tier II police officer, hired in 2014 and passed
away earlier this year, with one year and seven months of service for the Chicago Police
Department. As of this date, the Fund has not had any Tier II deaths. The widow’s application has
been accepted and calculation is pending. At this time, cautious review of the Tier II language will
continue, along with waiting for any further developments in Springfield. It was also noted that the
Firemen’s Fund of Chicago has a similar situation and has not awarded such widow any benefits.

The Executive Director reported that she met with the executive directors of the Laborers’,
Firemen’s and Municipal Pension Funds, along with two representatives from Mesirow Insurance
Services and discussed the efforts to reduce fiduciary liability premiums. Mesirow is the insurance
broker for the four City pension funds. Mesirow, in an effort to potentially reduce the premium
suggested that the four pension funds set their policies to renew at the same time, and all four funds
could be presented for coverage in an effort to solicit the most competitive bids. Additionally, the
Executive Director requested that Mesirow consider a reduction in their commission percentage in
an effort to reduce costs. Current brokerage commission for PABF is under $25,000.
After lengthy discussion, it was moved by Trustee Maloney, seconded by Trustee Wright that the
Executive Director prepare a RFP for insurance brokerage services for fiduciary liability and have it
available for the next meeting of the Board.

‘no show’ fee.
