Purpose:
The Midwest Partners are Federal, State, and Local staff in the Midwest geographical region which
includes Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin. These partners are committed to
improving the administration of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and focuses on
activities which improve and sustain timely and accurate benefit approvals, reduce procedural errors, and
build regional and national partnerships by sharing successful strategies and best practices. As we
implement program changes to meet the demand for nutritional assistance, the upcoming Midwest
Partners event will provide valuable tools to help agencies manage workload. With ongoing budget
challenges, it is essential that State and Local agencies use technology and other management tools to
continue high benefit accuracy and excellent service. This Midwest Partners event is timely in that the
workshops will help agencies provide a forum to recognize the excellent work currently happening in the
Midwest and to share best practices.
