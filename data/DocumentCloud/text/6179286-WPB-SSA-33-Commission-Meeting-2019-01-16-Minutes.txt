4. Chamber of Commerce ED Report; delivered by PM
a. The WPBCC has begun orientation with five new board members. They will also be offering
sponsorship level memberships for 2019. The Chamber will be holding its annual retreat and board
meeting at Antique Taco on Feb. 19. The February mixer will be a joint mixer with the Logan Square
Chamber at The Logan Theatre on Feb. 13. The WPB Wellness Days will take place at the Wicker Park
Farmers Market for the final two market days in April at Chop Shop.
5. Program Manager report; delivered by GK
a. GK delivered a supplemental summary of expenses relating to the 2018 budget (through 12/31/18)
with a breakdown of the SSA’s remaining 2018 expenses yet to be paid out and carryover. A similar
summary for 2019 was also presented showing the amount of 2019 budget already allocated (through
12/31/18) on items such as snow removal and litter abatement (over 30%). These reports emphasize
that roughly 75% of the budget in any given year is available to allocate through Commission meetings,
as staffing/rent/office expenses are close to 25% of the budget. This summary report will be included in

 every Commission packet moving forward to give staff & Commission a better real-time understanding
of the SSA budget.
b. GK discussed the record attendance of committee meetings this month since staff has begun to
send email reminders and updates. The first Window Works exhibit is set to be installed at the end of
this month. There is now a complete inventory of bike racks, planters and cigarette recycling cans
throughout the SSA. GK suggests the SSA #33 hold a joint mixer with SSA #27 (Lakeview) to compare and
contrast projects and processes.
