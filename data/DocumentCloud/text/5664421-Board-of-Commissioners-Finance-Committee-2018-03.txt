(a) Living wage requirement.
(1) Unless expressly waived by the County Board, any Employer occupying a property that receives
a property tax incentive for Class 6b industrial property, Class 8 industrial property, or Class 9
multifamily residential property shall pay not less than the Living Wage, as defined in the Cook
County Procurement Code (Cook County, Ill., Code, Ch. 34, Art. IV, Div. 1 ยง 34-121), to each
of its onsite Employees, unless such Employees' Wages are governed by Federal or State
prevailing wage law. For purpose of this Section, the term "Employee" shall mean an Employee
who performs duties or services for an Employer on average at least 30 hours per week in any
two-week period for which the Employee is paid; "hours per week" shall mean hours for which
an Employee is paid or entitled to payment by the Employer for a period of time during which no
duties are performed by the Employee due to vacation, holiday, illness, incapacity, jury duty,
military duty or approved leave of absence.
(2) On and after July 1, 2020, the owner of any property that receives a property tax incentive shall
notify all Employers who occupy such property as lessees of the requirements of this Section.
Upon commencement of a lease, on or after July 1, 2020, of a property that receives a property
tax incentive, any new lessee shall be required to submit to the municipality or the Cook County
Board, as the case may be, an affidavit stating that such lessee is paying a Living Wage to its
Employees in compliance with this Section. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the
requirements of this Section shall not apply to an Employer who was a lessee and not an
owner-occupant of a property that receives a property tax incentive prior to July 1, 2020.
(3) This Section shall not apply to Employers that are not-for-profit organizations or funded by
Federal grants or Federal loans or Employers who are lessees but are not owners of a property
that receives a property tax incentive prior to adoption of this amended Ordinance. Further, this
Section shall not apply to Employers who can demonstrate to the County Board that compliance
with the requirements of this Section would cause such Employer to be in violation of the terms
of a collective bargaining agreement between the Employer and a labor union.
(4) Every Employer required to pay the Living Wage shall notify its Employees of the Living Wage
requirements and shall notify all of its Employees annually of any adjustment to the Living Wage.
In addition, the Employer shall notify its Employees that if any Employee contends that the
Employer is not paying a Living Wage or has otherwise violated this section, that Employee may
file a complaint with the Cook County Commissioner on Human Rights ("Commission"). The
Commissioner shall investigate alleged violations of the Living Wage Ordinance and is authorized
to adopt regulations for the proper administration and enforcement of its provisions. If at the
conclusion of the Commission's investigation, the Commission finds that the Employer has
violated this section, it shall (i) in the case of an Employer receiving a property tax incentive,
notify the Assessor; or (ii) in the case of a Contractor or a subcontractor required to pay the
Living Wage, notify the CPO, who shall exercise such remedies as are in the best interest of the
County, including ordering the Employer to pay back pay and penalties, as provided in this

section.
(5) If an Employer is found to be in violation of this section, such Employer may be required to pay
back pay to each affected Employee, and may also be fined by the County up to $100.00 for
each affected Employee for each day paid at less than the Living Wage. Such penalties will not
be imposed on any Person except after a hearing (Cook County, Ill., Code, Ch. 2, Art. IX).
Further, if an Employer is found to be in violation of this section, the property tax incentive for
this property is subject to revocation.
(6) If an Employer is found to have retaliated against an affected Employee, the Employer's property
tax incentive may be terminated unless such Employer appropriately reinstates or compensates
such Employee.
(7) For the purposes of this Section:

Property tax incentive means a reduction in the assessment level as set forth in Division 2 of this
Article for Class 6b industrial property, Class 8 industrial property, or Class 9 multifamily residential
property. "Property tax incentive" shall not include a Class 9 designation granted to supportive living
facilities, which establish an alternative to nursing home care for low income older persons and persons
with disabilities under Medicaid and which are certified by the State Department of Public Aid pursuant to
Division 2 of this Article; and
Sales tax means the Retailer's Occupation Tax, the Service Occupation Tax and/or the Use Tax.
(8) Living Wage Affidavit. Every municipality or the Cook County Board that provides a Resolution
or Ordinance or authorized officer letter, as the case may be, to an applicant for a Class 6b
industrial property or a Class 8 industrial property tax incentive shall maintain in its files and
records documentation that such municipality or the County Board received and filed the Living
Wage Affidavit submitted by the owner or lessee of such property stating that such owner or
lessee is paying a Living Wage to its Employees in compliance with this Section. Further, an
applicant or lessee of a Class 9 multifamily residential property tax incentive shall provide the
municipality or the Cook County Board, as the case may be, a Living Wage Affidavit which shall
be maintained by such municipality or the Cook County Board in its files and records.
(b) Prevailing wage requirement.
(1) Any owner of real estate that on or after January, 2018 is an applicant for, or recipient of, any
Property Tax Incentive under any Assessment Class as set forth in Division 2 of this Article for
which a Resolution or Ordinance from the municipality or the County Board is or was required,
or where an authorized officer letter is or was obtained in lieu of such Resolution or Ordinance,

governs the payment of wages.
(2) The Assessor shall obtain an affidavit or certification from every Person and Substantial Owner
(as defined in Cook County, Ill., Code, Ch. 34, Art. V ยง 34-367) who seeks a property tax
incentive from the County as noted in Division 2 of this Article certifying that the Person or
Substantial Owner (as defined in Cook County, Ill., Code, Ch. 34, Art. V ยง 34-367) has not
violated the statutory provisions identified in Subsection (a) of this Section.
(3) If the County or Assessor becomes aware that a Person or Substantial Owner (as defined in

adjudicated guilty or liable in any judicial or administrative proceeding of committing a repeated
or willful violation of the Illinois Wage Payment and Collection Act, 820 ILCS 115/1 et seq., the

Substantial Owner's (as defined in Cook County, Ill., Code, Ch. 34, Art. V ยง 34-367) subject
property under a property tax incentive classification, then, after notice from the Assessor of
such violation, the Person or Substantial Owner shall have 45 days to cure its violation and
request an exception or waiver from the Assessor. Failure to cure or obtain an exception or
waiver of ineligibility from the Assessor shall serve as grounds for revocation of the
classification as provided by the Assessor or by the County Board by Resolution or Ordinance.
In case of revocation or cancellation, the Incentive Classification shall be deemed null and void
for the tax year in which the incentive was revoked or cancelled as to the subject property. In
such an instance, the taxpayer shall be liable for and shall reimburse to the County Collector an
amount equal to the difference in the amount of taxes that would have been collected had the
subject property not received the property tax incentive.
Effective date: This ordinance shall be in effect immediately upon adoption.
