said the title refers to a crime prevention program designed to alert the public to specific conditions
which provide opportunities for criminal activity to occur. Mr. Boots said that police officers,
while on patrol will leave a form on a vehicle or at a house if they see open or unlocked doors or
another situation that would invite a crime to occur. The form serves as a notification to the vehicle
or home owner to be more careful. Mr. Joens proposed the addition of the word “Notices” to the
record series title for item #237 so that it will read as, Crimes of Opportunities Notices. Ms.
Dabizljevic made a motion to approve 14:027C as amended. Ms. McKee seconded the motion.
