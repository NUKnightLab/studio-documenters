 2. UHC 2018 Medical Plan Performance Review
The team of representatives from UnitedHealthcare (UHC) and Optum reviewed CCPF Health Plan
financial and utilization results for the year 1/1/2018 through 12/30/2018.
Health Plan enrollment increased 1% from the prior year to 12,679 members. The per-member-permonth (PMPM) paid expense decreased 8.4% from 2017 resulting in an annualized 2% three year
medical trend. A 20% decrease in catastrophic cases over $50,000 contributed to the overall
decrease in PMPM costs, however, a 13% decrease for non-Medicare members under age 65, and a
3% decrease for Medicare members was offset by a 4% increase for the population of non-Medicare
members over the age of 65. The paid PMPM expense for non-Medicare members over the age of
65 is significantly higher than the Medicare members ($1,318 vs. $138).
Hypertension and diabetes were the Fund’s most prevalent disease conditions with diabetes
accounting for 40% of the Fund’s annual medical spend. Emergency Room (ER) visits increased
5% from prior year, whereas visits to Urgent Care Centers decreased by 5%. The Health Benefits
Committee requested additional analysis to determine if any ER utilization was from Urgent Care
facilities billing as an ER. The Committee also recommended member communications to raise
awareness of the potential confusion between ER and Urgent Care.
Cancer was the most prevalent catastrophic diagnosis in 2018. Mike Wall from Optum reviewed
early results from the Cancer Support Program that was implemented in November 2018. Nine
members representing $715,000 in claim costs are currently enrolled in the program which provides
telephone outreach and support to cancer patients and family members.
3. Segal 2018 Health Plan Budget Projections to Actual
Dan Levin compared 2018 actual expenses to what was budgeted for the 2018 calendar year. Mr.
Levin stated that projections for 2018 expenses were made in August of 2017, based on 3 years of
claims experience for the plan years July 1, 2014, through June 30, 2017. Actual experience was
approximately 10% better than projected because PMPM claims decreased by more than 8% from
2017 to 2018 and the initial projections assumed an annual trend increase of 7% non-Medicare and
5% Medicare.
Mr. Levin reported that as a result of the Fund’s favorable 2018 experience, the largest projected
increase in total cost rates is projected to be 4%. Medicare total cost rates are projected to decrease,
due to the savings negotiated on the EGWP pricing. Without the negotiated EGWP savings, the
projected Medicare savings rates would be an additional increase of about 2% (Choice Plan) to 3%
(Choice Plus). Mr. Levin and Tom Wysomirksi presented preliminary premium rates for 2020 based
on claims experience through March, 2019. Final 2020 total cost rates will be updated for the
Committee at the August 21, 2019 meeting.
4. Administrative Report
a. CAR-T Therapy Follow-up
Ms. Hawes reviewed a letter she sent to UHC stating that no benefits for CAR-T Therapy
2

 should be approved or paid for CCPF members at this time since the Fund has not added
coverage for CART-T Therapy to the Choice or Choice Plus plans.
b. CVS ID Cards for Dependents
Effective August 1, 2019 each member in the CVS Commercial plan will be assigned their
own ID number and issued a new ID card. Currently, spouses and child dependents are
assigned the same ID number as the annuitant, however, this creates enrollment disconnects
when the annuitant is elevated to Medicare status in the EGWP SilverScript plan. Fund staff
is working with CVS to test eligibility file changes and develop communications which will
be mailed to members in mid-July.
c. Blood Pressure Monitor/Scale Coupon Results
UHC received 1,639 coupons from CCPF Health Plan members: 73% of coupon requests
were for a scale; 27% for blood pressure monitors. The first 200 members to submit coupons
will be shipped the item they selected.
d. 2019 Wellness Budget
UHC has agreed to reimburse CCPF for 2019 expenses related to health benefits
communications and Medicare/Open Enrollment events.
e. Personal Pay Policy Exceptions
Gina Tuczak discussed the need for a policy to manage hardship requests from members who
want to pay Personal Pay premiums after the due date. Ms. Tuczak presented a written
exception policy which would require Executive Director approval of requests made by the
Health Benefits Director. Exception Requests would be kept on file for on-demand review
by the Health Benefits Committee or any other Trustee.
It was moved by Trustee McFadden and seconded by Trustee Goode, to recommend the
Board accept the Exception Policy.
Vote Result:

MOTION ADOPTED BY VOICE VOTE

5. Old Business/New Business
There was no old business or new business discussed.
6. Adjournment
There being no further business before the Committee, it was moved by Trustee Goode and
seconded by Trustee DeGraff that the trustees adjourn the meeting.
