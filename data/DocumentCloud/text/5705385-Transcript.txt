as you also

am the Acting Chairman of the CDC,

During the Advisory Board,
URLAUB, BOWEN & ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312)

781-9586

and this

I

asked

 6

09:29AM

1

the question about the separation of church and

2

state because it was presented that this is a

3

religious organization.

4

there was an opinion issued by Mayer Brown that

5

that was okay.

6

09:30AM

09:30AM

The next question that I

raised was

7

whether they will comply with all City ordinances,

8

including nondiscrimination regarding sexual

9

orientation because,

as I

mentioned at the CDC,

10

religious organizations have a

11

they allow in their facilities.

12

question that was presented.

13

at that time.

14

into it.

lot of leeway on who
And that was a

There was no answer

So the attorney said they will look

At the CDC last week,

15

16

present,

17

said that yes,

18

regulations and City ordinances.

and I

and you were

made the same statements,

and they

that they will comply with all the

Since then,

19
09:30AM

And we were clear that

I

think that there have

20

been some negotiations between the City and the

21

Salvation Army to clarify what the real positions

22

are.

23

24

So our position,
from the Advisory Board,

URLAUB,

our recommendation

as long as all decisions

BOWEN & ASSOCIATES,
(312) 781-9586

INC.

 7

09:30AM

1

are clarified,

2

sure that the organization doesn't discriminate for

3

any reason --

4

ALDERMAN AUSTIN:

5

MR.

in complying with the City

7

since at the time that the meeting took place.

But that's not what has transpired

ALDERMAN AUSTIN:

I

think that what has

occurred is a misunderstanding.

Because from my

10

understanding from Major Harvey is that the reason

11

for the denial would be if you're renting the

12

facility,

13

I

14

facility as another church.

15

what has been transmitted to you,

and you want to use it as a church,

have a right to say,

MR.

16

LE6N:

No,

no,

then

you cannot use this

I mean,

I

if

that's not

09:31AM

we were okay;

Because I

believe that I

20

didn't bring these issues up because of Christ the

21

King.

22

the Salvation Army because they are --

23

is a church?

24

But now we got issues because of this with

going to discriminate

STEPHAN:

I

Can the lawyers

can respond to that.

We have

had a series of discussions with them.
And first

5

let me

just be clear that

6

because they are a

religious organization,

many of

7

the anti-discrimination laws contain exceptions for

8

religious organizations.

9

comply with law.

So they have agreed to

But because of these exceptions,

10

it is not likely that they would be restricted from

11

discriminating.

12

So we've asked for additional

13

covenants in the loan agreement that will be

14

between CDF and the Salvation Army about

15

discrimination,

16

that they will not discriminate in the provision of

17

services or the rental of the facility.

and they have agreed in principle

18

But they have also indicated that

19

they will not rent the facility for religious or

20

political purposes.

21

facility to another religious organization for

22

worship.

And so they will not rent the

23

ALDERMAN AUSTIN:

24

MR.

STEPHAN:

Right.

They have indicated that they
