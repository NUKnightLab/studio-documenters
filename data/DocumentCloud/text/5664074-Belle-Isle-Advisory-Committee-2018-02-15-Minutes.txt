 PRESENTATION
Stepping Stones Program
Gary Williams, MSU Extension, shared a Powerpoint presentation, giving an overview of the
above program. This program is designed to bring urban youth a fun, educational outdoor
experience in a Michigan State Park. Stepping Stones is now offered at 8 State parks. The goal is
to keep youth close to home while introducing them to the outdoor experience. Youth participate
in at least one of the following activities: fishing, archery, Camping 101, nature exploration, and
water studies. The program has had over 1,200 participants with 90% of the youth indicating
they would like to come back and visit a state park. Both staff and chaperones expressed that
they would recommend this program to others.
GENERAL UPDATES
DNR Law Enforcement Update
Lieutenant Joe Molnar reported that it is a slow time of the year and the island has been
relatively quiet. Molnar also noted the following:
When you dial 911, the call automatically routes to either the Detroit Police Department or the
Michigan State Police. There are still a few issues with the routing system due to the fact we are
so close to Canada. However, we will be working out those issues. Still use 911 as your primary
emergency helpline, otherwise, you can find at State Trooper, Conservation Officer, or Park
Ranger to assist in any major matters.

MDOT will begin setting up cones and block off points the first week of March. March
through June 2, 2018 there will be restricted lane access.
There will be one lane in and one lane out available for use during the construction
process. After June 2, 2018 there will be 2 lanes open each way Friday – Monday for
more efficient traffic flow. Two lane traffic will be extended for special events and
holidays. Listed below is a summary of those events and dates:
o Freedom Festival Fireworks – Monday, June 25, 2018 at 3:00 p.m. through
Thursday, July 5, 2018 at 6:00 a.m.

There will be one pedestrian bike lane open during construction, which lane to be utilized
is currently under review.
The Internal Affairs building bids were received on February 7, 2018 and were higher
than the initial budget. Documents will be reviewed to bring the requirements within the
budget.
The following projects are currently on hold until spring 2018:
o Casino
o Athletic Field
o North shore fishing pier
o Scott Fountain ADA access
A study is being planned to review the restoration of the Conservatory. With this study
we hope to determine if the Conservatory will be restored to its original 1904 Victorian
state or will be renovated in the 1950’s “updated” image.
Paint work is complete on shelter 5; once the weather improves concrete will be poured
at both shelters 5 and 6. Expected completion is April 2018.
Surveys for the boating access site will be conducted at both Belle Isle and Milliken State
Park and Harbor.
The Lake Okanoka project dredging stage is complete. It is expected that refilling of the
lake will take approximately one week. The sanitary portion of the project will be
conducted next week. Once the bridge permit is received from MDOT, it will take
approximately 2 months to construct the bridge that will connect the two waterways for
recreational use.
Farrow Contracting has offered to remove the water slide. We will be working with him
in the near future to complete this process.

insert the cigarette butt as a means of disposal rather than
throwing out a window.
