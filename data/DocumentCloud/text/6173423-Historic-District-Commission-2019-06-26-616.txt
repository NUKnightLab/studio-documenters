STAFF REPORT 6-26-2019 MEETING
APPLICATION NUMBER 19-6292
ADDRESS: 616 PALLISTER
HISTORIC DISTRICT: NEW CENTER AREA
APPLICANT: MIDTOWN DETROIT INC.
DATE OF STAFF VISIT: 06-21-2019

PREPARED BY: B. CAGNEY

PROPOSAL
Pasllister Park is located immediately south of Delaware Street, between Bethune Court and Second
Avenue. The park has two segments, separated by the brick pedestrian pathway extending from Pallister
Street. The park is bordered by a black, metal fence with brick piers. Trees line the perimeter of both park
areas while the interior is grass open space. Sanborn maps indicate that the northern part of this vacant
space was previously used as a parking lot, however staff was unable to locate the sanborn map for the
lower part of the property.
Midtown Detroit Inc. states in their application that in January, 2017, a survey was sent to residents in the
New Center area to identify how Pallister Park was being used and what future uses and recommendations
they would like to see. In the spring of 2017, a public meeting was held to share results and receive
feedback on the most popular recommendations, which included the installation of play equipment
structures. Further, residents indicated that the playground equipment selected should have a “natural”
design.
The proposal seeks activate the southern portion of the park. The proposed project consists of constructing
three circular areas within the lawn that will be surrounded by a 2” concrete curb. These elements will be
consolidated into the southeast corner of the park for a total of approximately 2,970 sf. In each of these
areas, one piece of play equipment will be installed: A “tire swing,” a “tree house” and a “log scramble.”
The surfacing in these areas will be infilled with engineered wood fiber. The current proposal also offers to
install such amenities as bollards with pet waste stations, trash receptacles (surrounded by wood, no
specifications attached with application proposal) and landscaping that includes ornamental grasses, low
plants and boulders around the perimeter of the circles (no specifications attached with application
proposal). Three maple trees are also proposed to be planted outside the circle. The application also states
that temporary fencing will be erected around the area during construction and any disturbed lawn will be
restored to match existing.

ELEMENTS OF DESIGN
(13)

Relationship of significant landscape features and surface treatments. The typical treatment of individual properties is
a flat or slightly graded front lawn area in grass turf subdivided by a concrete or brick walk leading to the front
entrance; a side walk sometimes leads to the rear. On sufficiently graded lots, steps lead up the earthwork terraces to
the front steps. Some straight side driveways, primarily in concrete but a few in brick, leading from the street to the
rear garages exist on Virginia Park, Bethune, and Lothrop. Where front lawns are uninterrupted by driveways, a unity
to the succession of front lawns is achieved. Foundation plantings of an evergreen and deciduous character are present
on individual lawns. Hedges between properties along the side lot lines are common; properties on corner lots
frequently have hedges along the north south street. Trees are evenly spaced on the tree lawn; on Pallister where the
tree lawn has been widened, trees are planted close to the public side walk and upright lighting standards are evenly
spaced near the brick paving of the street. Public sidewalks throughout the district are concrete; brownstone and some
bluestone curbs remain on Delaware between Woodward and Second, Virginia Park and Seward. Virginia Park is
paved in brick; traffic off Woodward enters and exits through a horseshoe with wrought iron gates and brick piers with
stone cresting and foundations. A grassy turf, hedges, and young trees are planted inside the court created by the
horseshoe. Newer gates at the entrances of other blocks are of the same materials. Side and rear yard wooden fences,
either painted brown or left in a natural state, exist throughout New Center Commons. Side yard fences generally do
not extend beyond the face line of the front porch, except where they fence in side lots or comer properties. Fencing in
public view through the district, the fluted designed to compliment the style, design, material, and date of the residence.
Pallister between Second and Third Streets is a pedestrian street; it is paved in brick with concrete around its
perimeter. Street furniture and upright iron light standards are placed at regular intervals. Ornamental poles (O.P.type, Detroit Public Lighting) are located on Delaware between Woodward and Second, Virginia Park and Seward. On
Second Boulevard and Third Avenue, where they run throughout the district, are fluted steel lighting standards with
crane-neck pendants (Union Manufacturing Company No. 4700). Alleys are paved in either asphalt or concrete, the
exception being the alley north of Delaware east of Second, which is brick. Parking areas off the alleys next to the
alley-facing garages in New Center Commons are also either asphalt or concrete. Alleys are entered and exited on
Bethune Court; they do not have outlets on Third Avenue. Bethune Court, Bethune Street, and the alleys have tall,
modern light standards. Ornamental light posts on Pallister Commons are Union Metal Manufacturing No. SP874-Yl.

(14)

Relationship of open space to structures. Vacant land in the New Center Historic District is located immediately west
of Bethune Court, where it provides a small buffer from the street at the corners of Bethune Court and Pallister. Open
space on Pallister is provided by the brick-paved pedestrian mall and widened tree lawns. There is also ample vacant
land adjacent to the Virginia Park gates at the corners of Woodward and Virginia Park. Where buildings have been demolished, vacant land exists, usually in the form of parking lots. This condition prevails primarily in the block of
Virginia Park between the Lodge Service Drive and Third Avenue, and on Lothrop. Backyards as well as front yards
exist on all single- and double family residential properties; backyards to houses on Bethune, Pallister and Delaware
tend to be relatively small due to the placement of one and one-half (1%) or two and one-half (2%) car garages and
adjoining paved parking area off the alley.

(22)

General environmental character. The character of the New Center Historic District is that of late nineteenth century
and early twentieth century residences on straight east-west streets. A cohesiveness is attained by entrance gates,
uniform setbacks, spacing on lots, buried utilities, and, on Pallister, spacious tree lawns, street furniture, and brick
paving. Overall, the district has an urban, low to moderate density, revitalized residential character with small-scale
commercial usage on its southern periphery and on Second from Virginia Park to Delaware. (Ord. No. 530-H, § 1
(28A-141), 11-17-82)

RECOMMENDATION
It is staff’s recommendation that the Commission issue a Certificate of Appropriateness for the proposed work based
on the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation Number 10) New additions and adjacent or related

 new construction shall be undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity
of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired.

 Midtown Detroit Inc. Proposed improvements to Pallister Park, New Center Historic District

MDI has been working with the local neighborhood groups since early 2017 to design a playscape for the New Center
community. In January 2017 a resident survey was mailed to the New Center district to identify how Pallister Park was
currently being used within the community and what future uses and recommendations residents envisioned to
enhance the Park. A public meeting was held in Spring 2017 to share the results and receive additional feedback on one
of the top recommendations – a playscape. At this meeting a local designer hosted an engaging session with the
residents on the type, style, equipment and so forth the community would like to see as part of a playscape. The
neighborhood specifically requested a “natural” design for the playscape and trash receptacles. A concept was
developed and through the support of the neighborhood association CANCAN, subsequent updates provided through
the remainder of the year and through 2018 at neighborhood association meetings to share the status of the playscape.
The neighborhood has reviewed and approved the proposed design. The project must be started in mid-June in order to
preserve the price to construct the park improvements.
The proposal is for the south half of Pallister Park which is currently a grassy area with trees around the perimeter and a
brick sidewalk through the middle. No existing trees or walkways will be altered by this project. The blue circle indicates
the project location.

 The proposed project consists of constructing three circle areas within the lawn that will be surrounded by a 2-inch tall
concrete curb. All of the circles will be near each other and two will touch each other. One circle will be 1,020 square
feet, and the two adjoining circles will be 1,950 square feet. The ground within the circles will be infilled with
engineered wood fiber. Once piece of custom designed playground equipment will be installed within each circle – a
tire swing, a tree house, and a log scramble. Combination trash receptacles and pet waste disposal will be surrounded
by wood. Grasses, low plants, and boulders are proposed around the edges of the circles. Three maple trees are
proposed to be planted outside of the circles.
No new fencing is proposed during this project except temporary fencing around the area during construction. Any lawn
disturbed during construction will be repaired to match the existing.
