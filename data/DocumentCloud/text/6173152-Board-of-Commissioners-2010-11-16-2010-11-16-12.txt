 GENERAL BACKGROUND
As part of the Capital Improvement Program, the Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) solicited
bids to perform demolition work at LeClaire Courts (RH-02). LeClaire Courts extends along the
west side of South Cicero Avenue from 44th Street to 45th Street. The structures to be demolished
no longer serve a useful purpose and their demolition is needed as part of the ongoing renovation
of CHA developments under the Plan for Transformation. The demolition work at LeClaire
Courts was split into several bid packages to provide greater contracting opportunities for
vendors. Demolition, site work and landscaping is to be completed within ninety (90) calendar
days of the date set forth in the Notice to Proceed.
PROCUREMENT HISTORY
The CHA advertised Invitation for Bid (IFB) No. 10 – 00593 on August 23, 2010 for the
demolition of dwelling units at LeClaire Courts – Group 7. The IFB was advertised in the
Chicago Sun-Times, the Chicago Defender and El Dia, and on the CHA website and at
BuySpeed Online. The pre-bid meeting and site visit were held on August 26, 2010. The CHA
issued Addendum No. 1 on August 23, 2010 and Addendum No. 2 on August 24, 2010.
Addendum No. 1 and Addendum No. 2 added Pages BF/16, SC/2, and Page 2 of the Contractors
Affidavit of Uncompleted Work, which were inadvertently omitted from the original solicitation
on August 23, 2010. The CHA received and opened five (5) bids on September 16, 2010.
After reviewing the bid submittal materials, the Department of Procurement and Contracts and
the Capital Construction Department held a pre-award survey meeting with the apparent lowest
bidder, NF Demolition, Inc. The firm responded to questions on the thoroughness of its bid and
its capacity to perform this work. With the reviews, analysis and meetings completed, the
Department of Procurement and Contracts has determined that NF Demolition, Inc. is the lowest
responsive and responsible bidder for Group 7 with a bid of $463,074.00.
Based on the foregoing, it is in the CHA’s best interest for the Board of Commissioners to
authorize the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to execute a contract with NF Demolition,
Inc. for demolition services at LeClaire Courts – Group 7 for a firm fixed price of $463,074.00.
The demolition work and associated site work and landscaping is to be completed within ninety
(90) calendar days of the date set forth in the Notice to Proceed.
This award is subject to the Contractor’s compliance with the CHA’s MBE/WBE/DBE, Section
3 resident hiring, and bonding and insurance requirements.
