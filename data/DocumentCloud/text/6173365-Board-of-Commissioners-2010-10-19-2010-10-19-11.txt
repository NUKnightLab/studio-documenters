EXPLANATION
CHA requested submissions of qualifications from interested Developers to promote the
development or dedication of up to approximately 1,000 public housing units in mixed income
communities throughout the City of Chicago.
The HCE program is a compliment to the CHA’s revitalization program. The HCE program
provides the opportunity for the successful respondents to participate as either a mixed-finance
developer or turnkey developer. These two development methods attract a wide range of small
and large Developers.
Through the HCE Program RFQ, CHA sought developers who are interested in: 1) receiving
financial assistance and/or land from CHA in return for setting aside no more than thirty-three
percent (33%) of the units in each development project for public-housing eligible families
Mixed Finance Method; or 2) renovating homes under a turnkey purchase agreement in return
for setting aside up to 100% of the units in a scattered site for public housing/low income eligible
families Turnkey Method. HCE units under consideration for new family public housing are
subject to the Gautreaux court order. Any acquisition or long term lease is subject to HUD
approval, the Gautreaux court order and/or any other site specific approvals.

PROCUREMENT HISTORY
The RFQ for Housing for Chicagoans Everywhere Program (RFQ No. 10-00518) was released
on April 28, 2010. Eighty-five (85) vendors downloaded the solicitation from BuySpeed Online.
The RFQ was advertised in the Chicago Sun-Times on April 27, 2010, Chicago Defender on
April 28 – May 4, 2010, and the Extra Newspaper on April 29, 2010. The CHA directly solicited
sixty (60) firms and thirty-four (34) firms picked up the RFQ documents. A Pre-Submittal
Conference was held on May 10, 2010. Two addendums were issued on May 20, 2010 and May
28, 2010 to clarify questions raised during the Pre-Submittal Conference. The Department of
Procurement and Contracts received sixteen (16) qualifications on June 7, 2010.
Based on the foregoing, it is in the best interest of CHA to maintain a list of pre-qualified
housing developers, and development teams for the HCE program to provide replacement
housing units to CHA for eligible public housing families. CHA will either acquire units or enter
into long term leases for the units, subject to the approval of the CHA Board of Commissioners,
HUD and any other necessary approvals.
