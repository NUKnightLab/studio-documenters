Transmitting a Communication, dated January 3, 200 I from
JAMES L. ELDRIDGE, JR., Chief Administrative Officer, Bureau of Administration
Re: HOM E Investment Partnerships Program (HOM E Program)
The Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992, also known as Title X of the Housing
and Community Development Act of 1992, amended the Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act of
197 1 (Lead Act), which established the curre nt Federal lead-based pai nt requirements. The new
regulation took effect on September 15, 2000.
Since the Department of Planning and Development administers the Community Development Block
Grant (CDBG), HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME), and Emergency Shelter Grants
Program (ESG), three federally assisted housing programs covered by the Act, the Department is required
to address lead-based hazards effectively. The Department is requesting approval of $ 1,000,000.00 in
HOM E Program funds to be used for the rehabilitation and lead hazard reduction work of owner-occupied
single-fam ily homes.
The project complies with the HUD HOM E Program regulations and furthers the goals of the Five-Year
Consolidated Community Development Plan, approved by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development on October 17, 2000.
I respectfully request approval of this project, and that the Chief Administrative Officer of the County of
Cook, or his designee, be authorized to execute on behalf of the County of Cook, any and a ll documents
necessary to further the project approved herein, includ ing, but not limited to the Subgrantee Agreement
and any modifications thereto.

responsibility or obligation to any broker-dealer, bank or other financial institutions for which the
Depository holds Bonds from time to time as securities depository (each such broker-dealer, bank or other

Maturity Amount and integral multiples thereof. In the event of the redemption of less than all the Bonds
ofa series of like maturity, the aggregate principal amount or Maturity Amount (as appropriate) thereof to
be redeemed shall be $5,000 or an integral multiple thereof, and the Trustee shall assign to each such
Bond of such maturity a distinctive number for each $5,000 principal amount or Maturity Amount (as
appropriate) of such Bond and shall select by lot from the numbers so assigned as many numbers as, at
$5,000 for each number, shall equal the principal amount or Maturity Amount (as appropriate) of such
Bonds to be redeemed. C urrent Interest Bonds or Capita l Appreciation Bonds to be redeemed shall be
those to which were assigned numbers so selected; provided that only so much of the principal amount or
Maturity Amount (as appropriate) of each Bond shall be redeemed as shall equal $5,000 for each number
assigned to it and so selected.
The Trustee sha ll promptly notify the County in writing of the Bonds or portions of Bonds
selected for redemption and, in the case of any Bond selected for partial redemption, the principal amount
thereof to be redeemed.
Unless waived by the owner of Bonds to be redeemed, notice of any such redemption shall be
given by the Trustee on behal f of the County by mailing the redemption notice by first class mail not less
than 30 days and not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption to each registered owner of
the Bond or Bonds to be redeemed at the address shown on the Bond Register or at such other address as
is furnished in writing by such registered owners to the Trustee.
All notices of redemption shall include at least the information as fo llows:
(I)

the redemption date;

(2)

the redemption price;

(3)
if less than all of the Bonds of a particular series are to be redeemed, the
identification (and, in the case of partial redemption, the respective principal amounts) of the
Bonds to be redeemed;
(4)
a statement that on the redemption date the redemption price will become due
and payable upon each such Bond or portion thereof called for redemption and that interest
thereon shall cease to accrue from and after said date; and
(5)
the place where such Bonds are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption
price, which place of payment shall be the principal corporate trust office of the Trustee.
Such add itional notice as may be agreed upon with the Depository shall also be given so long as
the Bonds are he ld by the Depository.
Prior to any redemption date, the County shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money
sufficient to pay the redemption price of all the Bonds or portions of Bonds which are to be redeemed on
that date.
Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid, the Bonds or portions of Bonds so to be
redeemed shall, on the redemption date, become due and payable at the redemption price therein
specified, and from and after such date (unless the County shall default in the payment of the redemption
price) such Bonds or portions of Bonds shall cease to bear interest. Neither the failure to mail such
redemption notice nor any defect in any notice so mailed to any particular registered owner of a Bond
shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other registered owners. Notice having been

422

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDlNGS FOR JANUARY 23, 2001
properly given, failure of a registered owner of a Bond to receive such notice shall not be deemed to
invalidate, limit or delay the effect of the notice or the redemption action described in the notice. Such
notice may be waived in writing by a registered owner of a Bond, either before or after the event, and
such waiver shall be the equivalent of s uch notice. Waivers of notice shall be filed with the Trustee, but
such filing shall not be a cond ition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such
waiver. Upon surrender of such Bonds for redemption in accordance with said notice, such Bonds shall
be paid by the Trustee at the redemption price. Interest due on or prior to the redemption date shall be
payable as herein provided for payment of interest. Upon surrender for any partial redemption of any
Bond, there shal I be prepared for the registered owner a new Bond or Bonds of the same Stated Maturity
in the amount of the unpaid principal or Maturity Amount.
With respect to any redemption of Bonds, unless moneys sufficient to pay the redemption price
of the Bonds to be redeemed shall have been received by the Trustee prior to the giving of the notice of
redemption, such notice may, at the option of the County, state that s uch redemption shall be conditional
upon the receipt of such moneys by the Trustee on or prior to the date fixed for redemption. If such
moneys are not received, such notice shall be of no force and effect, the Trustee shall not redeem such
Bonds, and the Trustee shall give notice, in the same manner in which the notice of redemption shall have
been given, that such moneys were not so received and that such Bonds will not be redeemed.
If any Bond or portion of Bond called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof
for redemption, in the case of Current Interest Bonds, the principal shall, until paid, bear interest from the
redemption date at the rate borne by the Bond or portion of Bond so called for redemption, and, in the
case of Capital Appreciation Bonds, the Compound Accreted Value at such redemption date shall
continue to accrue interest from such redemption date at the Yield to Maturity borne by such Capital
Appreciation Bond, or portion thereof, so called for redemption. All Bonds which have been redeemed
shall be cancelled and destroyed by the Trustee and shall not be reissued.
Upon the payment of the redemption price of Bonds being redeemed, each check or other transfer
of funds issued for such purpose shall bear the CUSIP number identifying, by issue and maturity, the
Bonds being redeemed with the proceeds of such check or other transfer.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JANUARY 23, 200 1
PROPOSED ORDINANCE

The Cook County Predatory Lender Disinvestment Ordinance
WHEREAS, high cost lenders are preying on Cook County residents, aggressively marketing
high interest rate and high fee loans to residents of low and moderate-income communities;
and
WHEREAS, many of these predatory lenders are engaging in outright fraud and deception in
order to swindle people out of their homes; and
WHEREAS, some of the signs of a predatory lender include: a lender who has a record of
breaking federal and state laws; a lender who charges fees without relation to the actual costs
of services performed; a lender who charges fees out of proportion to the standards of the
industry; a lender who charges interest rates s ubstantially higher than those merited by the
credit risk represented by borrowers, and especially disproportionate rates to African
Americans and Latinos and other members of protected classes; a lender who originates loans
w ithout regard for the borrowers actual ability to pay; or a lender who engages in a pattern of
fraud and misrepresentation ofloan terms and costs; and
WH EREAS, these predatory lenders are stripping hard earned equity from county residents
and they are contributing to problems of vacant and abandoned houses by making loans that
famil ies cannot repay.

homes, there sha ll be a moratorium on creating a new mobile home park or expansion

Transmitted herewith for your approval is a request for authorization for the Purchasing

Skokie, Illinois. It is respectfully requested that this honorable body approve this request.
This project provides for the demolition of the existing garage and construction of a

Sufficient funds have been appropriated to cover this request.

*Referred to the Construction Committee on 01/04/01.

567

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JANUARY 23, 2001
Commissioner Silvestri asked if any of the Circuit Court judges have been in di scussions regarding the
demolition of the garage?
Michael Lamont responded that he has had severa l conversations with presiding Judge Nancy Salyers
who has been involved in the process and proposed solution. Further, he stated the j udges are primarily
concerned that the building of a replacement garage is moving ahead.
Commissioner Sil vestri asked if Forest Preserve property is next to the courthouse?
Michael LaMont stated that wooded property is to the north and the west of the courthouse that is Forest
Preserve property. He said trees and brush have been removed to accommodate the temporary parking.
Further, he stated that he expects the project to go out to bid at the end of January 200 I.
Mr. LaMont informed the members that the design team of Soodan & Associates was present and would
give the committee a brief presentation on the proposed new structure.
Kehar Soodan, President, Soodan & Associates, stated that the new garage would be higher, wider and
could provide more lighting and security. He said the garage is ADA compliant with four stair towers
and one elevator tower, which are also ADA compliant. He stated that the drawings are complete and the
garage is a double T pre-cast structure fo r better contro l.
Commissioner Hansen asked what is the capacity of the old garage?
Michael La Mont stated the capacity of the old garage is e leven hundred and forty, and the new garage is
one thousand fifty-two.
Comm issioner Hansen asked why the number of parking spaces were reduced?
Michael LaMont responded that the top deck on the old garage was rarely occupied, and traffic counts
were taken during peak periods and results indicated that the num ber of parked cars averaged nine
hundred.
Kehar Soodan stated another reason the number of spaces was reduced was due to handicap requirements.
Commissioner Hansen asked who conducted the count?
Michael LaM ont commented that the consultant working on the renovation of the garage did the count.
He further stated that a copy of the traffic report would be distributed to the commissioners.
Comm issioner Hansen asked what is the life expectancy of the new garage?
Michael LaMont stated he believes the service life fo r the new garage is forty years.
Commissioner Hansen asked what steps would the County now take that are different from what existed
when the current garage was bui lt?
Michael LaMont said he wou ld prepare a memorandum to the commissioners in response to
commissioner Hansen's question.

568

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JANUARY 23, 2001
Commissioner Silvestri asked how is the new garage different from the current garage in terms of traffic
pattern?
Kehar Soodan responded the traffic pattern is the same.
Commissioner Sims asked what is the life expectancy of the bond?
Michael LaMont stated he did not have the answer but will ask the State's Attorney's Office to respond.
He further stated there are many different factors involved in an outdoor structure.
Commissioner Silvestri asked how many garages the county operates?
Michael LaMont responded that the county operates six garages.
Commissioner Silvestri asked if there is a parking fee charged at any of the garages?
Michael LaMont stated that fees are charged at Cook County Hospital, Provident Hospital and the
Juvenile Temporary Detention Center.
Commissioner Hansen asked Michael LaMont to prepare a report on drainage in the structure during cold
weather.
Michael LaMont stated he would provide this infonnation in the memorandum.
Commissioner Collins asked if it is possible to separate the bids for construction and demolition?
Michael LaMont responded that he does not see an advantage to having two separate bids but will provide
a breakdown of the costs for the garage.
Commissioner Moran asked if the county built a flat parking structure, how many parking spaces could it
accommodate?
Michael LaMont responded that building a flat parking structure would not be feasible.
Commissioner Quigley stated many new parking structures are using computer designs for energy
efficiency that control the amount of wattage. He asked if a similar design system will be implemented in
the new garage?
Kehar Soodan responded that some of the garage lights do not go on during the day and are linked to a
timer.

Your Committee has considered the following items and upon adoption of this report, the
recommendations are as follows:
240491

PROVIDENT HOSPITAL OF COOK COUNTY, by Stephanie Wright-Griggs, C hief
Operating Officer, transmitting a Communication, dated December I, 2000:
I am res pectfully transmitting the revised Medical Staff By laws and General Rules and
Regulations of the Medical Staff of Provident Hospital of Cook County for approval by the
Cook County Board of Commissioners.

Commissioner Hansen made comments on the five amendments and stated the amendments ensure that
the executive and medical staff and other operational agencies at Provident Hospital are not in anyway cut
off from communicating directly with the Board of Commissioners, especially major entities.
In response to Commissioner Quigley's question regarding who enforces the bylaws, Elizabeth Reidy
stated when the bylaws are bei ng used as corrective action with regard to a member of a medical staff,
either denial of a reappointment or a corrective action, suspension removal, termination of privileges, then
the process itself sets up a mechanism where an appointee can refer someth ing to peer review if they
believe the bylaws are being violated and they question how the by laws are being implemented. Ms.
Reidy said the process provides for an initial peer review investigation. She said in a case of corrective
action when an adverse decision is made with regard to an appointee that appointee can elect to have a
hearing and a report is made and given to the medical staff. Also, in considering its final action, the board
has the initial investigation report, the recommendation of the executive medical staff as well as the
recommendation and findings of the hearing committee. Finally, she stated that the appointee as ample
opportunity to be heard with regard to any accusation. In add ition, she said there is a bylaws committee
of the medical staff that considers non-corrective action or reappointment issues.
Commissioner Quigley asked if the courts have the abi lity to enforce the hospital's bylaws?

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JANUARY 23, 2001
Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Committee on Legislation and Intergovernmental Relations of the Board of Commissioners of Cook
County met pursuant to notice on Thursday, January 4, 2001 at the hour of2:00 P.M. in the Board Room,
Room 569, County Building, 118 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois.
Your Committee has considered the following items and upon adoption of this report, the
recommendations are as follows:
With leave of the body, Chairman Hansen asked the Committee to consider Communication 240494 as
the first item of business.
240494

CRAWFORD COUNTRYSIDE SANITARY DISTRICT (APPOINTMENT). Transmitting a
Communication, dated December 19, 2000 from John H. Stroger, Jr., President, Cook County
Board of Commissioners:
I hereby appoint IRENE A. KLAIN to the Crawford Countryside Sanitary District for a tenn
to begin immediately. According to Illinois Statute 70 ILCS 2405/3, the expiration dates for
appointees to new sanitary districts are determined by lot at their first meeting.
I submit this communication for your approval.

Vice Chairman Lechowicz, seconded by Commissioner Daley, moved the approval of
Communication No. 240494. The motion carried.
1)

HOUSE BILL 1137 - REGARDING USE OF NEW ELECTION EQUIPMENT.

The Chairman asked the County Board ' s lobbyist to report on the current status and the prospect of
passage of this item.
Steve Morrill stated he had been advised there were no prospects of moving the bill during the remaining
two days of the current General Assembly.
Mr. Morrill reviewed the statutory need for the legislation. He stated the goal of using new election
equipment is to shorten the working day for the judges of elections by quickening returns and by reducing
the opportunity for vote fraud. He discussed the new equipment's features: 1) voters insert the ballot into
the tabulation machines; 2) tabulation machines maintain the vote count in real time.
Mr. Morrill also reviewed two features requested by the County Clerk and Chicago Board of Elections:
having the machines automatically return a ballot to the voter if it detected a ballot that I) lacked a judge
of elections initials on the back, and/or 2) had an over-vote. He stated the goal of using these features was
to insure that votes would not be uncounted because of an error by election judges or by the voter.
Mr. Morrill stated that the County Clerk's Election Department and Chicago Board of Elections gave a
presentation of the new election equipment features to the General Assembly a year ago. At that time
concerns were expressed regarding the security of the real-time count feature, the voter insertion feature
and automatic ballot rejection feature. Mr. Morrill stated that concerns remain regarding the automatic
ballot rejection feature.

574

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JANUARY 23, 200 1
Steve Morrill informed the members that language had been drafted containing the necessary
authorization to use the new equipment with the real-time count and voter insertion features, but the other
features were put aside for future consideration. Mr. Morrill stated that the measure stands in the House
Rules Committee. Mr. Morrill said the argument expressed during recent discussions was that if authority
is given to election authorities in Cook County to use and test new voting technology, then similar
authorization for DuPage County election authorities to use and test new equipment should also be
included.
In response to Chainnan Hansen's inquiry on how the lobbyists plan to get this matter passed, Steve
Morrill stated that it is important that the Speaker of the House and Pres ident of the Senate reach an
accord. He recommended that the county board members contact their respective legislators regarding
this issue.
Commissioner Daley asked Eugene Barnes whether the latest Senate Conference Committee Report draft
included the authorization the City and County need in order to use the equipment with all four features.
Mr. Barnes stated the draft did not include authorization for a ll the fea tures. He stated that during the
Spring Session, the Speaker had expressed to the Senate that Direct Reco rding Electronically (DR E)
authorization was not hi s concern and did make it c lear that the House would not move the bill if the
Senate sent language that did not include the authorization Chicago and Cook County need in order to use
the equipment' s four features.
Vice Chairman Lechowicz expressed concern that without the authorization to use the equipment with all
the features purchased by the Board, there is the possibi lity that errors by the election judges and/or an
error by the voter could disenfranchise voters in future e lections.
Concurring with Vice Chairman Lechowicz, Commissioner Daley stressed the importance of immediately
obtaining the authorization from the General Assembly to al low for the training of election judges and the
implementation of the machines optional features prior to the local elections in April.
Chairman Hansen requested a memo from the lobbyists with recommendations to the President and Board
on how to proceed. The Chairman asked that the memo be attached to two legislative proposals
inc luding: 1) a draft authorizing the use of the equipment's features allowing for voters to directly insert
the completed ballot into the vote tabulation machines and for the machines, in real-time fashion, to
maintain the vote count; and 2) a draft authorizing the machines to automatically return a ballot to the
voter if a ballot lacks a judge of elections initial s on the back or has an overvote.
Vice Chairman Lechowicz suggested the lobbyists plan to introduce bills in both the House and Senate
and include in the memo the names of possible sponsors. He also asked that the lobby ists coordinate
drafting the substantive language and lobbying efforts with the County Clerk's Election Department and
the Chicago Board of Elections.
The Chairman cal led upon Gary Rycyzyn to comment o n the County Clerk's desires in terms of the
features of the equipment and on securi ty concerns relative to the automatic ballot return feature. Gary
Rycyzyn stated the Clerk would like to have autho rization to use the equipment with all its features.
In response to Commissioner Daley's question if any election judges were trained on use of the new
features, Gary Rycyzyn stated that since the features were not used in the last election, no training was
necessary. Mr. Rycyzyn stated he believed at least one judge, from each party would have to be trained in
each precinct.

575

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDI NGS FOR JANUARY 23, 200 1
C ha irman Hansen expressed his concern on providing improved voter and e lection judge instruction on
how to cast and properly handle a ballot if all the features are authorized. Chairman Hansen also stressed
his concern regarding the rejection feature compromising secrecy and the need for allowing only a voter
to handle a ballot to be counted.
C hairman Hansen requested a memo from Gary Rycyzyn stating the Clerk's policy and proced ures to
protect the security of ballots, by Monday, January 8, specifically relating to the handling of ballots cast
and then rejected when a vote defect is detected by the automatic return feature.

Commissioner Daley moved to adjourn the meeting, seconded by Vice C hairman Lechowicz. The
motion carried and the meeting was adjourned.
