1.DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTWORK

Name: Prismatica

Type: Interactive iight installation
Location: Outdoors Indoors
Description:

A modern ice palace. Prismatica turns heads with the countless colourful reflections made by its
giant prisms. Visitors can walk among them to see city life in every colour of the spectrum, and
turn the prisms to make the colours dance. After sunset, the enormous interactive kaleidoscope?s
illusory effects reach a crescendo.

Prismatica is a participatory installation comprising 25 pivoting prisms more than two meters tall.
Each one is made of panels covered with a dichroic film that reflects the colours of the rainbow,
varying with the light source and viewing angle. Each prism is mounted on a base containing a
projector that gives the installation a new dimension after nightfall. The rotation of the prisms
triggers variable-intensity bell music.

Dear Ms. Anderson,

On behalf ofthe Sacred Roots Community Heritage Garden (AIHFS), I am writing to offer our full
assistance in purchasing and installing a garden kiosk at the farms space in Romanowski Park. The costs,
approximately $300 are being borne by the group mentioned above. These improvements will take
place October, 2018. We have worked with community representatives to ensure these improvements
are desired.

The Sacred Roots will oversee construction of the kiosk and any future maintenance needed to maintain
the installation. This kiosk will provide a space to post information about the garden and upcoming

park and community.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

DATE: 20 Sep 2018
RE: CHWMAAH

As per Sharon Rose?s response memo dtd. 14 Mar 2018, please identify and allocate $3.5 million in the FY
2019-20 budget to fund the Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History. This is a $1.6
million increase over the FY 2018-19 budget. The increase should be used in the following manner: $1.1
million should be classi?ed as a capital improvement for the repair of the museum?s roofand the additional
$500k should be used for operations. My office will work with the OCFO to identify $1.6 million to fund
this new expenditure.

As we look to care for our cultural gems it becomes ever more critical that we provide the proper financial
support for our institutions and ensure these organizations are able to provide programing to the Metro?
Detroit region?s residents without fear ofthe roof falling in, or the inability to provide a safe and
comfortable environment. 1 believe it is a regional shortcoming that this cultural gem, designed to tell the
story of America?s African descendants, does not have a dedicated revenue stream, i.e. millage, like its
neighbor the Detroit Institute of Arts. Ms. Rose?s memo response to the museum?s capital improvement
need is inserted below.

1) Please briefly explain the new capital funding requests MAAH is planning to
implement in FY 2019. Please provide which Appropriation/Cost Center the new
initiatives will affect in FY 2019.

The museum desires to replace the 21-year old roof system that is original to the
building. The roof has exceeded it life expectancy and is exhibiting signs of
shrinkage and deterioration. Once the membrane begins to degrade to this point, the
seams beneath the ballast stone become more stressed, creating the potential for large
seam failures. Unfortunately with a single -ply, ballasted EPDM roof system, there are
no options for restoring the roof and repairs/maintenance costs are typically expensive
due to the amount of labor required to find the leak area, remove the ballast stone,
properly clean the membrane, and finally make the repair. Once the roof system reaches
the end of its life, there are no other options other than replacement. There would be
considerable cost, structural and potential health issues if the roof leaks are not
addressed. Although some roof repairs have just been made, it was only designed to get
the museum by until the necessary roof replacement is started. The total roof
replacement cost is estimated at between $900,000 and $1.2 million 

If you have any questions do not hesitate to contact my of?ce at, 313-224-1 198
