 POLICE AND FIRE RETIREMENT SYSTEM OF THE CITY OF DETROIT
MEETING NUMBER 3151 – THURSDAY – JULY 6, 2017
EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS
BY TRUSTEE NEARY – SUPPORTED BY TRUSTEE DIAZ
WHEREAS, the City of Detroit is required by Component I of the Combined Plan for the
Police and Fire Retirement System of the City of Detroit (“PFRS”) to submit annual
contributions as a percent of payroll based on a formula as set forth in Section 9.3(2) of
Component I, also referred to as the ‘hybrid’ plan, and
WHEREAS, depending on when the final payroll period concludes in June each year, the
City is presented with a practical challenge in providing the payroll information to PFRS
such that PFRS is able to generate an invoice for the correct employer contribution payment
amount consistent with Section 9.3(2) of Component I, as well as the additional step for the
City to authorize and disburse a multi-million dollar payment once it receives an invoice from
PFRS, and
WHEREAS, the best example of such practical challenge is illustrated by the fiscal year end
in 2017, where June 30, the end of the pay period, fell on a Friday, and
WHEREAS, the Combined Plan is silent as to these practical challenges, which could
arguably result in a technical default by the City of its obligations pursuant to the Combined
Plan as well as the Eighth Amended Plan for Adjustment of Debts of the City of Detroit,
Michigan, which was confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court by Order dated November 12,
2014, and which incorporated the Combined Plan, and
WHEREAS, the City has moved to dividing the annual contribution amounts required by
section 9.3(2) of Component I into quarterly payments of employer contribution amounts
owed to PFRS over each fiscal year, and
WHEREAS, the Board desires to maintain the working business relationship between the
City and PFRS in a manner that reflects the practicalities described above, which can be
accomplished by providing the City with 30-day payment terms upon PFRS providing an
employer contribution invoice reflecting a payroll amount, and
WHEREAS, the Board has considered this matter in open session, therefore be it

7

 POLICE AND FIRE RETIREMENT SYSTEM OF THE CITY OF DETROIT
MEETING NUMBER 3151 – THURSDAY – JULY 6, 2017
EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS - CONTINUED
RESOLVED, that once PFRS provides an employer contribution invoice to the City, the City
will have 30 days to comply with that invoice and deliver payment to PFRS which matches
the invoiced amount, and be it further
RESOLVED, that PFRS Staff will work with General Counsel to add appropriate language
to the employer contribution invoice form to reflect this 30-day payment term, and be it
further
RESOLVED, that a copy of this resolution be provided to PFRS Staff; the City of Detroit
Finance Department; and PFRS General Counsel:
