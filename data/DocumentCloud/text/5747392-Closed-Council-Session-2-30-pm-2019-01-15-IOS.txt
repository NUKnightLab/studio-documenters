avion 8.: Sams 24 Hour Towing Service, Inc.
8100 Road

Detroit, Michigan 48234

RE: OIG Investigation File Nos. 18-0008-INV and 18-0042-INV

Notice of Final Decision of the Proposed Debarment Initiation of Debarment
Proceedings for: Joan Fiore and Javion Sam?s 24 Hour Towing Service, Inc.

Dear Ms. Fiore:

This letter is being sent to your attention in accordance with Section 18-1 1-9 of the City of
Detroit Debannent Ordinance. On November 2, 2018, the Of?ce of Inspector General (010)
recommended that Javion Sam?s and Joan Fiore be debarred for a period of ?fteen (15) years,
effective May 7, 2018. After having reviewed your reSponse dated November 30, 2018, in
opposition to the proposed debarment, we are upholding our recommendation and the grounds for
the deban'nent are stated below.

First, we note your November 30, 2018 letter contains no additional substantive evidence
which would suggest that the OIG report of Administrative Hearing Fina] Recommendation, dated
November 2, 2018, was factually inaccurate.

Moreover, the points you raise in your argument in Opposition to the proposed debarment
are not supported by any legal authority or new evidence. In particular, you raise the following
arguments in opposition to the recommendation:


.

The 01G has no legal authority to debar contractors.

2. The Debarment Ordinance is not applicable to the 2016 towing permits.

3. The 016 improperly relied on information contained in a wiretap af?davit to support its
recommendation.

4. The OIG cannot debar Javion Sam?s and Joan Fiore for ?lack of cooperation" as the OIG
did not use its subpoena power to compel records and testimonies.

5. Proposed terms of debarment are excessive and inconsistent with the Inspector General?s

past recommendations. Federal law and state law are much more lenient.

Page 1 of 5

6. The scepe of the 016 administrative hearing was to address whether Javion Sam?s
should be precluded from bidding on future contracts with the City and did not contemplate
debarment.

7. The ?ndings of fact are not supported by evidence.

The OIG Has the Authorityr to Dehar Contractors

The 016?s authority to debar is derived from Sections 6-308 and 7.5310 of the 2012 City
of Detroit Charter (the Charter, as well as the City?s Debarment Ordinance.

Read as a whole, contractors are required to cooperate with an 016 investigation. Anyone
who chooses not to comply with an OIG request for documents and testimony subjects themselves
to discipline, up to and including debarment. ?Contractor? and ?Public Servant? are further de?ned
in Section 2-105 of the Charter and Section 18-1 1-3 of the City?s Debarment Ordinance. Likewise,
Section 18-11-3 of the Debarment Ordinance de?nes ?Debarment? as ?action taken by the City to
exclude a person from acting as a contractor for a speci?ed period of time.?

In addition to Section 75-310 of the 2012 City of Detroit Charter, Section 6-308 of the
Charter requires the Corporation Counsel to prepare and the City Council to implement the
Debarment Ordinance which designates the Inspector General as the ?chief investigative agent?
for debarment.

The Debarment Ordinance was adopted by City Council as mandated by the 2012 Charter.
The adaptation of the ordinance by the Council was not an attempt to ?backstop its prior action
terminating [your] corporate clients? towing permits in 2018 and to continue to violate [your]
clients? due process rights? as you claim. The ordinance was not enacted just for your clients
and/or other tow companies.

charment Ordinance is applicable to the 2016 Towing PermiLs

The Debarment Ordinance applies to all contractors, including any party who seeks to enter
into a contract with the City. The initial recommendation to preclude avion Sam?s and
Joan Fiore from bidding on the City?s towing contracts was made in May 2018, prior to the
enactment of the City?s Debarment Ordinance. However, the ordinance was adopted by Council
and became effective on August 10, 2018, before the ?nal recommendation of November
2, 2018 and before the OIG initiated debarment proceedings against the tow companies and its
owners. Therefore, the City?s Debarment Ordinance is applicable to the 2016 towing permits.

 

 

The Portions of Findings Which Relied on the Wiretap Af?davit Was Proper

The 016 reviewed thousands of pages of documents including but not limited to court
?lings, permit applications, Michigan Licensing and Regulatory Affairs (LARA) ?lings, and
hearing transcripts. The 010?s recommendation was not solely based on the information contained
in the wiretap af?davit nor did we improperly rely on the information contained therein. As
you are well aware, during the July 27, 2018 Hearing on Motion for Preliminary Injunction in
Joan Lucas v. City of Detroit, the Honorable Laurie J. Michelson ruled on the admissibility of the
wiretap af?davit. She ruled as follows:

was the criminal proceeding for which the wiretaps were authorized.
And the information sought to be introduced here regarding the

Gasper Fiore and Joan and Jennifer Fiore regarding the names of the
towing companies to be provided to Washington was publicly
revealed during the sentencing phase of that case. And as I
understand it, the information was also utilized during the preceding
before the Inspector General. So, there are not strong privacy

To provide additional context to the wiretap information, you could have testi?ed at the
administrative hearing. In fact, the OIG requested that you appear to provide more information
about the evidence contained in the wiretaps. However, your attorney submitted an affidavit that
was devoid of any clarifying information and provided no additional information for any OIG
follow-up questions. Therefore the OIG relied on the plain language contained in the wiretap.

The 016 is Not Required to Subpoena Records andlor Testimonyr Before Finding Lack of
Cooperation

Section 7.5-3 07 of the Charter states that ?[t]he Inspector General may subpoena witnesses,
administer oaths, take testimony, require the production of evidence relevant to a matter under
investigation, enter and inspect premises within the control of any city agency during regular
business hours.? (Emphasis added.) However, the 016 is not required to do so; it is at the
discretion of the Inspector General. Duty to c00perate is not required by a subpoena. The duty to
cooperate is required by the Charter. Therefore, requests for information and
documentation triggers the contractor?s duty to cooperate, not a subpoena.

The Proposed Years of Debarment for Javion Sam?s and Joan iore are Not Excessive or
Inconsistent

The initiation of debarment proceedings is pursuant to the City of Detroit Debannent
Ordinance, not under state or federal law. The 01G does not have jurisdiction over state and/or
federal contractors. Likewise, neither federal nor state law conceming debarment is applicable or
controlling to the City. If contractors were concerned that the potential maximum debarment
period was excessive, they had the opportunity to oppose it at the public hearing. However, no
such opposition occurred. Further, if contractors are truly concemed about debarment and the
impact it could have on their businesses, they should not engage in conduct that would subject
them to the ordinance.

The 016?s proposed debannent period for avion Sam?s and Joan Fiore is just that, a
proposal. The Inspector General?s past recommendation of May 2018 was just an initial
recommendation based on the Inspector General?s initial ?ndings, before the administrative

Page 3 of5

hearing. There is nothing inconsistent in the May 2018 recommendation and the 010?s ?nal report
and recommendation of November 2018, or the resulting initiation of debarment proceedings. The
016 provided avion Sam?s and Joan Fiore due process in the administrative hearing. However,
they chose not to fully participate. Consistent with the commitment to providing due
process, the parties have the right to oppose the debarment proceedings and the number of years
pr0posed for the debarment. Javion Sam?s and Joan Fiore exercised this right on Friday,
November 30, 2018. avion Sam?s and Joan Fiore have the further right to appeal the 016?s
?nal recommendation under the ordinance to City Council.

?e Bgsis of the Pronogcj Debarment is the Result of the Findings from tl_1e Administrative
Hearing Provided to Javion Sam?s and Joan Fiore

Javion Sam?s and Joan Fiore requested an administrative hearing on the 016?s initial
recommendation to preclude Javion Sam?s ?'om bidding on the current Municipal Parking
Department and Detroit Police Department towing contracts. The purpose of the hearing was to
permit Javion Sam?s and Joan Fiore an opportunity to present testimony and any supporting
information in response to the initial ?nding of May 2018. Prior to the hearing, during the
hearing, and after the hearing the 016 clearly identi?ed to counsel for avion Sam's and Joan Fiore
the additional information they need to submit to the 016 to potentially overtum its recommendation.
Counsel, on behalf of his clients, elected not to fully c00perate. Thus, any ?nal recommendation made
by the 016 was based on the available information, including information made available by the
attorneys representing the tow companies.

Javion Sam?s was suspended by the Board of Police Commissioners when the 010
initiated its investigation. Although the Debarment Ordinance does allow the InSpector General
to issue an interim suspension for up to ninety (90) days pending investigation, suspension is not
required prior to debarment initiation under the ordinance.

The OlG?s Figdings in the Final Recommendation Was Made Based on the Information
Made Available to the OIG.

Finally, the OIG ?nal report is supported by the entire record of information and by a
preponderance of the evidence presented to the OIG. Javion Sam?s and Joan Fiore made a
blanket statement in their response to the OIG that its ??ndings of fact are not supported by
evidence.? Yet no attempt was made on their part to specify any information contained in the ?nal
report that is inaccurate. Further, no additional information was provided to the 010 to consider
and potentially amend its debarment recommendation; this includes information previously
requested by the 01G but not provided as detailed in the administrative hearing report.

As such, the 016 is upholding its debarment recommendation that Javion Sam?s and
Joan Fiore be debarred for ?fteen (15) years, effective May 7, 2018. Therefore, if you disagree
with the recommendation of debarment or the length of debarment, you may appeal to the
Detroit City Council within 28 days of the date of this letter. See Section 18-11-11(a) of the
Debannent Ordinance. To do so, you must send the appeal letter together with any supporting
materials to the City Clerk for transmission to City Council. See Section 18-11-] 1(b) of the
Debarment Ordinance.

Proceedings for: Paul Ott, City Wide Towing, Inc. and Gene?s Towing, Inc.

Dear Mr. Fraser:

This letter is being sent to your attention in accordance with Section 1 3-1 1-9 of the City of
Detroit Debarment Ordinance. On November 2, 2018, the Office of inspector General (GIG)
recommended that City Wide, Gene's, and Paul Ott be debarred for a period of seven (7) years
effective May 7, 2018. After having reviewed your resPonse dated November 30, 2018, in
opposition to the proposed debarment, we are upholding our recommendation the grounds for the
debarment are stated below.

First, we note your November 30, 2018 letter contains no additional substantive evidence
which would suggest that the OIG report of Administrative Hearing Final Recommendation, dated
November 2, 2018, was factually inaccurate.

Moreover, the points you raise in your argument in opposition to the proposed debarment
are not supported by any legal authority or new evidence. In particular, you raise the following
arguments in opposition to the recommendation:

I. The 016 has no legal authority to debar contractors.

2. The Debarment Ordinance is not applicable to the 2016 towing permits.

3. The OIG improperly relied on information contained in a wiretap af?davit to support its
recommendation.

4. The OIG cannot debar City Wide, Gene?s, and Paul Ott for ?lack of cooperation? as the
OIG did not use its subpoena power to compel records and testimonies.

5. Proposed terms of debarment are excessive and inconsistent with the Inspector General?s
past recommendations. Federal law and state law are much more lenient.

Notice of Final Decision of the Proposed Debarment Initiation of Debarment
Proceedings for: Anthony Thomas and Towing, LLC

Dear Mr. Thomas:

This letter is being sent to your attention in accordance with Section 18-11-9 of the City of
Detroit Debarment Ordinance. On November 2, 2018, the Of?ce of Inspector General (OIG)
recommended that and Anthony Thomas be debarred for a period of seven years,
effective May 7, 2018. After having reviewed your response dated November 30, 2018, in
Opposition to the proposed debarment, we are upholding our recommendation and the grounds for
the debarment are stated below.

5. Proposed terms of debannent are excessive and inconsistent with the Inspector General?s

6. The scope of the 010 administrative hearing was to address whether should be
precluded ?-om bidding on future contracts with the City and did not contemplate
debarment.

7. The ?ndings of fact are not supported by evidence.

The OIG Has the Authority to Debar Contractors

The 016?s authority to debar is derived from Sections 6?308 and 75-310 of the 2012 City
of Detroit Charter (the Charter), as well as the City?s Debarment Ordinance.

Read as a whole, contractors are required to cooperate with an 016 investigation. Anyone
who chooses not to comply with an OIG request for documents and testimony subjects themselves
to discipline, up to and including debarment. ?Contractor" and ?Public Servant? are further defined
in Section 2-105 of the Charter and Section 18-] 1?3 of the City?s Debarment Ordinance. Likewise,
Section 18-1 1-3 of the Debarment Ordinance de?nes ?Debarment? as ?action taken by the City to
exclude a person from acting as a contractor for a speci?ed period of time.?

In addition to Section 75-310 of the 2012 City of Detroit Charter, Section 6-308 of the
Charter requires the Corporation Counsel to prepare and the City Council to implement the
Debarment Ordinance which designates the Inspector General as the ?chief investigative agent?
for 

The Debarrnent Ordinance was adapted by City Council as mandated by the 2012 Charter.
The adaptation of the ordinance by the Council was not an attempt to ?backstop its prior action
terminating [your] corporate clients? towing permits in 2018 and to continue to violate [your]
clients? due process rights? as you claim. The ordinance was not enacted just for your clients
and/or other tow companies.

Debarment Ordinance is applicable to the 2016 Towing Permits

The Debarment Ordinance applies to all contractors, including any party who seeks to enter
into a contract with the City. The initial recommendation to preclude you from bidding on
the City?s towing contracts was made in May 2018, prior to the enactment of the City's Deban'nent
Ordinance. However, the ordinance was adopted by Council and became effective on August 10,
2018, before the 016?s final recommendation of November 2, 2018 and before the 016 initiated
debannent proceedings against the tow companies and its owners. Therefore, the City?s
Debarment Ordinance is applicable to the 2016 towing permits.

The 016 reviewed thousands of pages of documents including but not limited to court
?lings, permit applications, Michigan Licensing and Regulatory Affairs ?lings, and
hearing transcripts. The OlO?s recommendation was not solely based on the infonnation contained
in the wiretap af?davit nor did we improperly rely on the information contained therein. As
you are well aware, during the July 27, 2018 Hearing on Motion for Preliminary fiy'zmcti'on in
Jena Lucas v. City of Detroit, the Honorable Laurie J. Michelson ruled on the admissibility of the

Proceedings for: Jessica Lucas and Boulevard Trumbull Towing, Inc.

Dear Mr. Shannon:

This letter is being sent to your attention in accordance with Section 18-11-9 of the City of
Detroit Debarment Ordinance. On November 2, 2018, the Of?ce of InSpector General (016)

effective May 7, 2018; and Jessica Lucas be debarred for a period of ten (10) years, effective May
7, 2018. After having reviewed your response dated November 30, 2018, in opposition to the
proposed debarment, we are Upholding our recommendation and the grounds for the deban'nent
are stated below.

First, we note your November 30, 2018 letter contains no additional substantive evidence
which would suggest that the 016 report of Administrative Hearing Final Recommendation, dated
November 2, 2018, was factually inaccurate.

Moreover, the points you raise in your argument in opposition to the proposed debarment
are not supported by any legal authority or new evidence. In particular, you raise the following
arguments in Opposition to the 016?s recommendation:

1. The 016 has no legal authority to debar and Jessica Lucas.

2. The Debarment Ordinance is not applicable to because was a permit holder.

3. permit was suspended and was later denied the right to bid on towing contracts
before the Debarment Ordinance was passed.

4. The 016 cannot debar and Jessica Lucas for ?lack of couperation? as the OIG did
not use its subpoena power to compel records and testimonies.

5. The scope of the 01G hearing was to address whether should be precluded from
bidding on ?iture contracts with the City and did not contemplate debannent. .

Page 1 of 5

6. Proposed terms of debarment are excessive and inconsistent with the Inspector General?s
past recommendations. Federal law and state law are much more lenient.

7. The OIG improperly relied on information contained in a wiretap af?davit to support its
recommendation.

8. The ?ndings of fact are not supported by evidence.

The OIG Has the Authority to Debar and Jessica Lucas

The authority to debar is derived from Sections 6-308 and 75-310 of the 2012 City
of Detroit Charter (the Charter), as well as the City?s Debarment Ordinance.

Read as a whole, contractors are required to cooperate with an 016 investigation. Anyone
who chooses not to comply with an OIG request for documents and testimony subjects themselves
to discipline, up to and including debarment. ?Contractor? and ?Public Servant? are further de?ned
in Section 2-105 of the Charter and Section 18-11-3 of the City?s Debannent Ordinance. Likewise,
Section 18-11-3 of the Debarment Ordinance de?nes ?Debarment? as ?action taken by the City to
exclude a person from acting as a contractor for a speci?ed period of time.?

In addition to Section 7.5-310 of the Charter, Section 6-308 of the Charter requires the
Corporation Counsel to prepare and the City Council to implement the Debarment Ordinance
which designates the Inspector General as the ?chief investigative agent? for debarrnent.

The Debarment Ordinance was adopted by City Council as mandated by the 2012 Charter.
The adaptation of the ordinance by the Council was not an attempt to ?backstop its prior action
terminating Boulevard?s permit in 2017 and to continue to violate Boulevard?s due process rights?
as you claim. The ordinance was not enacted just for and/or other tow companies.

Debnrment Ordinance is applicable to to Jessica Lucas

The Debarment Ordinance applies to all contractors, including any party who seeks to enter
into a contract with the City. The initial recommendation to preclude from bidding on
the City's towing contracts was made in May 2018, prior to the enactment of the City?s Debannent
Ordinance. However, the ordinance was adopted by Council and became effective on August 10,
2018, before the 016?s ?nal recommendation of November 2, 2018 and before the 010 initiated
debarrnent proceedings against the tow company and its owner. Therefore, the City?s Debarment
Ordinance is applicable to and to Jessica Lucas.

 

The OIG is Not Required to Subpoena Records auditor Testimony Before Finding Lack of
Cooperation

Section 7.5-307 of the Charter states that ?[t]he Inspector General may subpoena witnesses,
administer oaths, take testimony, require the production of evidence relevant to a matter under
investigation, enter and inspect premises within the control of any city agency during regular
business hours.? (Emphasis added.) However, the 010 is not required to do so; it is at the
discretion of the InSpector General. Duty to cooperate is not required by a subpoena. The duty to
cooperate is required by the Charter. Therefore, requests for information and
documentation triggers the contractor?s duty to cooperate, not a subpoena.

investigation. Although the Debarrnent Ordinance does allow the Inspector General to issue an
interim suspension for up to ninety (90) days pending investigation, suspension is not required
prior to debarment initiation under the ordinance.

The Proposed Years of Debarment for and Jessica Lucas are Not Excessive or
Inconsistent

The initiation of debarment proceedings is pursuant to the City of Detroit Debannent
Ordinance, not under state or federal law. The OIG does not have jurisdiction over state and/or
federal contractors. Likewise, neither federal nor state law concerning debarment is applicable or
controlling to the City. If contractors were concerned that the potential maximum debarment
period was excessive, they had the opportunity to oppose it at the public hearing. However, no
such opposition occurred. Further, if contractors are truly concerned about debarment and the
impact it could have on their businesses, they should not engage in conduct that would subject
them to the ordinance.

The 010?s proposed debarment period for and Jessica Lucas is just that, a proposal.
The Inspector General?s past recommendation of May 2018 was just an initial recommendation
based on the Inspector General?s initial ?ndings, before the administrative hearing. There is
nothing inconsistent in the May 2018 recommendation and the 016?s ?nal report and
recommendation of November 2018, or the resulting initiation of debarment proceedings. The
OIG provided and Jessica Lucas due process in the administrative hearing. However, they
chose not to fully participate. Consistent with the commitment to providing due process,
the parties have the right to oppose the debarment proceedings and the number of years proposed
for the debarment. Boulevard Trumbull and Jessica Lucas exercised this right on Friday,
November 30, 2018. Boulevard Trumbull and Jessica Lucas have the further right to appeal the
010?s ?nal recommendation under the ordinance to City Council.

The Portions of Findings Which Relied on the Wiretap Af?davit Was Proper.

The 016 reviewed thousands of pages of documents including but not limited to court
?lings, permit applications, Michigan Licensing and Regulatory Affairs (LARA) ?lings, and

hearing transcripts. The recommendation was not solely based on the information contained
in the wiretap af?davit nor did we improperly rely on the information contained therein.
During the July 27, 2018 Hearing on Motion for Preliminary Injunction in Joan Lucas v. City of
Detroit, the Honorable Laurie J. Michelson ruled on the admissibility of the wiretap af?davit. She
ruled as follows:

Again, the wiretap evidence was publicly disclosed by the defendant
in the Celia Washington case, albeit, inadvertently. And again, that
was the criminal proceeding for which the wiretaps were authorized.
And the information sought to be introduced here regarding the
communications between Celia Washington and Gasper Fiore and
Gasper Fiore and Joan and Jennifer Fiore regarding the names of the
towing companies to be provided to Washington was publicly
revealed during the sentencing phase of that case. And as I
understand it, the information was also utilized during the preceding
before the Inspector General. So, there are not strong privacy
interests at stake here either. So, for those reasons, I am going to
DENY the Motion to 

To provide additional context to the wiretap information, and Ms. Lucas could have called
those identi?ed on the wiretaps to testify at the administrative hearing. However they chose not
to. Therefore the OIG relied on the plain language contained in the wiretap.

The 010?s Findings in t_he Figgl Recommendation Was Mat?ased on Information
Made Available to the OIG.

Finally, the OIG ?nal report is supported by the entire record of information and by a
preponderance of the evidence presented to the OIG. and Ms. Lucas made a blanket
statement in their response to the 016 that its ??ndings of fact are not supported by evidence.?
Yet no attempt was made on their part to specify any information contained in the ?nal report that
is inaccurate. Further, no additional information was provided to the 016 to consider and
potentially amend the debarrnent recommendation; this includes information previously requested
by the 016 but not provided as detailed in the administrative hearing report.

As such, the 010 is upholding its debarment recommendation that be debarred for
twenty (20) years and Jessica Lucas be debarred for ten (10) years, respectively effective May 7,
2018. Therefore, if you disagree with the 010's recommendation of debarment or the length of
debarrnent, you may appeal to the Detroit City Council within 28 days of the date of this letter.
See Section 18-11-ll(a) of the Debarment Ordinance. To do so, you must send the appeal letter
together with any supporting materials to the City Clerk for transmission to City Council. See
Section 18-11-1 1(b) of the Debarment Ordinance.

RE: OIG Investigation File Nos. 18-0008-INV and 

Notice of Final Decision of the 010?s Proposed Debarment Initiation of Debarment
Proceedings for: Casper Fiore

Dear Mr. Bachand:

This letter is being sent to your attention in accordance with Section 18?11-9 of the City of
Detroit Debarment Ordinance. On November 2, 2018, the Of?ce of Inspector General (010)
recommended that Gasper Fiore be debarred for a period of twenty (20) years, effective May 7,
2018. A?er having reviewed your response dated November 30, 2018, in opposition to the
proposed debarment, we are upholding our recommendation and the grounds for the debarment
are stated below.

First, we note your November 30, 2018 letter contains no additional substantive evidence
which would suggest that the 016 report of Administrative Hearing Final Recommendation, dated
November 2, 2018, was factually inaccurate.

Moreover, the argument you raise in your opposition to the proposed debarment is not
supported by any legal authority or new evidence. In particular, you raise the following argument
in opposition to the 010?s recommendation:

0 Proposed terms of debarment are excessive in nature, and is completely arbitrary and
capricious. Federal law and state law are much more lenient.

The Proposed Years of Debarment for Casper Flore Is Not Excessive, Arbitrary or
Capricious

The initiation of debarrnent proceedings is pursuant to the City of Detroit Debarment
Ordinance, not under state or federal law. The OIG does not have jurisdiction over state and/or
federal contractors. Likewise, neither federal nor state law concerning debarment is applicable or
controlling to the City. If you or your client were concerned that the potential maximum debannent
period was excessive, you and your client had the Opportunity to oppose it at the public hearing.

Page 1 of 2

However, no such opposition occurred. Further, if your client was truly concerned about
debarment and the impact it could have on his businesses, Mr. Fiore should not have engaged in
conduct that would subject him to the ordinance.

There is nothing arbitrary or capricious in the initiation of debarment proceedings.
Consistent with the commitment to providing due process, Mr. Fiore has the right to oppose
the debarment proceedings and the number of years proposed for the debarment. Mr. Fiore
exercised this right on Friday, November 30, 2018 by opposing the pr0posed debarment.
Additionally, Mr. Fiore has the further right to appeal the 010?s ?nal recommendation under the
ordinance to City Council.

Therefore, the 016 is upholding its debarment recommendation that Gasper Fiore be
debarred for twenty (20) years, effective May 7, 2018. If you disagree with the ?nal
recommendation of debarment or the length of debarment, you may appeal to the Detroit City
Council within 28 days of the date of this letter. See Section 18-11-1 1(a) of the Debarment
Ordinance. To do so, you must send the appeal letter together with any supporting materials to
the City Clerk for transmission to City Council. See Section 18-11-11(b) of the Debarment
Ordinance.

RE: OIG Investigation File Nos. 18-0008-INV and 18-0042-INV

Notice of Final Decision of the Proposed Debarment Initiation of Debarment
Proceedings for: Joan Fiore and Javion Sam?s 24 Hour Towing Service, Inc.

Dear Mr. Fraser:

This letter is being sent to your attention in accordance with Section 18-1 1-9 of the City of
Detroit Debannent Ordinance. On November 2, 2018, the Of?ce of Inspector General (OIG)
recommended that Javion Sam?s and Joan iore be debarred for a period of fifteen (15) years,
effective May 7, 2018. After having reviewed your response dated November 30, 2018, in
opposition to the proposed debarment, we are upholding our recommendation and the grounds for
the debarrnent are stated below.

First, we note your November 30, 2018 letter contains no additional substantive evidence
which would suggest that the OIG report of Administrative Hearing Final Recommendation, dated
November 2, 2018, was factually inaccurate.

Moreover, the points you raise in your argument in opposition to the preposed debarment
are not supported by any legal authority or new evidence. In particular, you raise the following
arguments in opposition to the 010?s recommendation:

1. The OIG has no legal authority to debar contractors.

2. The Debarment Ordinance is not applicable to the 2016 towing permits.

3. The 010 improperly relied on information contained in a wiretap af?davit to support its
recommendation.

4. The 010 cannot debar Javion Sam?s and Joan Fiore for ?lack of cooperation" as the OIG
did not use its subpoena power to compel records and testimonies.

5. Proposed terms of debarment are excessive and inconsistent with the Inspector General?s
past recommendations. Federal law and state law are much more lenient.

Page 1 of 5

6. The scope of the OIG administrative hearing was to address whether Javion Sam?s
should be precluded from bidding on future contracts with the City and did not contemplate
debarment.

7. The ?ndings of fact are not supported by evidence.

The OIG Has the Authoritv to Debar Contractors

The authority to debar is derived from Sections 6-308 and 75-310 of the 2012 City
of Detroit Charter (the Charter, as well as the City?s Debarment Ordinance.

Read as a whole, contractors are required to cooperate with an 010 investigation. Anyone
who chooses not to comply with an 010 request for documents and testimony subjects themselves
to discipline, up to and including debarment. ?Contractor? and ?Public Servant? are further de?ned
in Section 2-105 of the Charter and Section 18-] 1-3 of the City?s Debarment Ordinance. Likewise,
Section 18-11-3 of the Debarment Ordinance de?nes ?Debarment" as ?action taken by the City to
exclude a person from acting as a contractor for a speci?ed period of time.?

In addition to Section 7.5-310 of the 2012 City of Detroit Charter, Section 6?308 of the
Charter requires the Corporation Counsel to prepare and the City Council to implement the
Debarment Ordinance which designates the Inspector General as the ?chief investigative agent?
for debarment.

The Debarment Ordinance was adopted by City Council as mandated by the 2012 Charter.
The adaptation of the ordinance by the Council was not an attempt to ?backstop its prior action
terminating [your] corporate clients? towing permits in 2018 and to continue to violate [your]
clients? due process rights? as you claim. The ordinance was not enacted just for your clients
and/or other tow companies.

Debarment Ordinance is applicable to the 2016 Towing Permits

The Debarment Ordinance applies to all contractors, including any party who seeks to enter
into a contract with the City. The initial recommendation to preclude Javion Sam?s and
Joan Fiore from bidding on the City?s towing contracts was made in May 2018, prior to the
enactment of the City?s Debarment Ordinance. However, the ordinance was adopted by Council
and became effective on August 10, 2018, before the 010?s ?nal recommendation of November
2, 2018 and before the 016 initiated debarment proceedings against the tow companies and its
owners. Therefore, the City?s Debarment Ordinance is applicable to the 2016 towing permits.

 

 

The Portions of Findings Wh?h Relied on the Wiretap Af?davit Was Proper

The OIG reviewed thousands of pages of documents including but not limited to court
?lings, permit applications, Michigan Licensing and Regulatory Affairs (LARA) ?lings, and
hearing transcripts. The recommendation was not solely based on the information contained
in the wiretap af?davit nor did we improperly rely on the information contained therein. As
you are well aware, during the July 27, 2018 Hearing on Motion for Preliminary Iry'zmction in
Joan Lucas v. City of Detroit, the Honorable Laurie J. Michelson ruled on the admissibility of the
wiretap af?davit. She ruled as follows:

To provide additional context to the wiretap information, Joan Fiore could have testi?ed at the
administrative hearing. In fact, the 010 requested that she appear to provide more information
about the evidence contained in the wiretaps. However, she instead chose to submit an af?davit
that was devoid of any clarifying information and provided no additional information for any 016
follow-up questions. Therefore the OIG relied on the plain language contained in the wiretap.

The 01G is Not Required to Subpoena Records agdfor Testimony Before Lack of
Cooperation

Section 7.5-3 of the Charter states that ?[t]he Inspector General may subpoena witnesses,
administer oaths, take testimony, require the production of evidence relevant to a matter under
investigation, enter and inspect premises within the control of any city agency during regular
business hours.? (Emphasis added.) However, the 010 is not required to do so; it is at the
discretion of the Inspector General. Duty to cooperate is not required by a subpoena. The duty to
cooperate is required by the Charter. Therefore, requests for information and
documentation triggers the contractor?s duty to cooperate, not a subpoena.

The Proposed Years of Debarment for Javion Sam?s and Joan Fiore are Not Excessive or
Inconsistent

The initiation of debannent proceedings is pursuant to the City of Detroit Debannent
Ordinance, not under state or federal law. The OIG does not have jurisdiction over state and/or
federal contractors. Likewise, neither federal nor state law concerning debarment is applicable or
controlling to the City. If contractors were concerned that the potential maximum debarment
period was excessive, they had the opportunity to Oppose it at the public hearing. However, no
such opposition occurred. Further, if contractors are truly concerned about debarment and the
impact it could have on their businesses, they should not engage in conduct that would subject
them to the ordinance.

The 016?s preposed debarment period for Javion Sam?s and Joan Fiore is just that, a
proposal. The Inspector General?s past recommendation of May 2018 was just an initial
recommendation based on the Inspector General?s initial ?ndings, before the administrative

hearing. There is nothing inconsistent in the May 2018 recommendation and the ?nal report
and recommendation of November 2018, or the resulting initiation of debarment proceedings. The
OIG provided Javion Sam?s and Joan Fiore due process in the administrative hearing. However,
they chose not to fully participate. Consistent with the commitment to providing due
process, the parties have the right to oppose the debarment proceedings and the number of years
proposed for the debarment. avion Sam?s and Joan Fiore exercised this right on Friday,
November 30, 2018. Javion Sam?s and Joan Fiore have the further right to appeal the 016?s
?nal recommendation under the ordinance to City Council.

The Basis of the Proposed Debarment is the Result of the Findings from the Administrative
Hearing Provided ta Javion Sam?s and Joan Fiore

avion Sam?s and Joan Fiore requested an administrative hearing on the 016?s initial
recommendation to preclude Javion Sam?s from bidding on the current Municipal Parking
Department and Detroit Police Department towing contracts. The purpose of the hearing was to
permit Javion Sam?s and Joan Fiore an opportunity to present testimony and any supporting
information in response to the initial ?nding of May 2018. Prior to the hearing, during the
hearing, and after the hearing the OIG clearly identi?ed to counsel for avion Sam?s and Joan iore
the additional information they need to submit to the 016 to potentially overturn its recommendation.
Counsel, on behalf of his clients, elected not to fully cooperate. Thus, any ?nal recommendation made
by the OIG was based on the available information, including information made available by the
attorneys representing the tow companies.

Javion Sam's was suspended by the Board of Police Commissioners when the OIG
initiated its investigation. Although the Debarment Ordinance does allow the Inspector General
to issue an interim suspension for up to ninety (90) days pending investigation, suSpension is not
required prior to debarment initiation under the ordinance.

The 010?s Findings in the Final Recommenggtion Was Made Based on the Information
Made Available to the OIG.

Finally, the 016 ?nal report is supported by the entire record of information and by a
preponderance of the evidence presented to the OIG. Javion Sam?s and Joan Fiore made a
blanket statement in their response to the OIG that its ??ndings of fact are not supported by
evidence.? Yet no attempt was made on their part to specify any information contained in the ?nal
report that is inaccurate. Further, no additional information was provided to the 010 to consider
and potentially amend its debarment recommendation; this includes information previously
requested by the OIG but not provided as detailed in the administrative hearing report.

As such, the OIG is upholding its debarment recommendation that Javion Sam?s and
Joan Fiore be debarred for ?fteen (15) years, effective May 7, 2018. Therefore, if you disagree
with the recommendation of debarment or the length of debarment, you may appeal to the
Detroit City Council within 28 days of the date of this letter. See Section 18-11-1 1(a) of the
Debarment Ordinance. To do so, you must send the appeal letter together with any supporting

before the Debarment Ordinance was passed.

RE: OIG Investigation File Nos. 18-0008-INV, 18-0043 and 18-0044-INV

Notice of Final Decision of the Proposed Debarment Initiation of Deharment
Proceedings for: Javion Sams? 24 Hour Towing Service, Inc.; Joan Fiorc; Towing,
Anthony Thomas; Gene?s Towing, Inc.; City Wide Towing, Inc.; and Paul Ott

Dear Mr. Fraser:

This letter is being sent to your attention in accordance with Section 18-] 1-9 of the City of
Detroit Debarment Ordinance. On November 2, 2018, the Of?ce of Inspector General (01G)
recommended that and Anthony Thomas be debarred for a period of seven (7) years,
effective May 7, 2018. After having reviewed your response dated November 30, 2018, in
opposition to the proposed debarment, we are upholding our recommendation and the grounds for
the debarment are stated below.

First, we note your November 30, 2018 letter contains no additional substantive evidence
which would suggest that the OIG report of Administrative Hearing Final Recommendation, dated
November 2, 2018, was factually inaccurate.

Moreover, the points you raise in your argument in opposition to the proposed debannent
are not supported by any legal authority or new evidence. In particular, you raise the following
arguments in Opposition to the 016?s recommendation:

1. The 010 has no legal authority to debar contractors.

2. The Debarment Ordinance is not applicable to the 2016 towing permits.

3. The OIG improperly relied on information contained in a wiretap af?davit to support its
recommendation.

4. The 010 cannot debar your clients for ?lack of c00peration? as the OIG did not use its
subpoena power to compel records and testimonies.

5. Proposed terms of debarment are excessive and inconsistent with the Inspector General?s
past recommendations. Federal law and state law are much more lenient.

6. The scope of the OIG administrative hearing was to address whether your clients should
be precluded from bidding on {bone contracts with the City and did not contemplate
debarment.

7. The 016?s ?ndings of fact are not supported by evidence.

The 01G Has the Authority to Debar Contractors

The authority to debar is derived ?'om Sections 6-308 and 75-310 of the 2012 City
of Detroit Charter (the Charter), as well as the City?s Debarment Ordinance.

Read as a whole, contractors are required to cooperate with an OIG investigation. Anyone
who chooses not to comply with an 010 request for documents and testimony subjects themselves
to discipline, up to and including debannent. ?Contractor? and ?Public Servant? are further de?ned
in Section 2-105 of the Charter and Section 18-11-3 of the City?s Debarment Ordinance. Likewise,
Section 18-1 1-3 of the Debarment Ordinance de?nes ?Debannent? as ?action taken by the City to
exclude a person from acting as a contractor for a speci?ed period of time.?

In addition to Section 75-310 of the 2012 City of Detroit Charter, Section 6-308 of the
Charter requires the Corporation Counsel to prepare and the City Council to implement the
Debannent Ordinance which designates the Inspector General as the ?chief investigative agent?
for debarment.

The Debarment Ordinance was adopted by City Council as mandated by the 2012 Charter.
The adaptation of the ordinance by the Council was not an attempt to ?backstop its prior action
terminating [your] corporate clients? towing permits in 2018 and to continue to violate [your]
clients? due process rights? as you claim. The ordinance was not enacted just for your clients
and/or other tow companies.

Debarment Ordinance is applicable to the 3016 Towing Permits

The Debarment Ordinance applies to all contractors, including any party who seeks to enter
into a contract with the City. The 016?s initial recommendation to preclude you from bidding on
the City?s towing contracts was made in May 2018, prior to the enactment of the City?s Debarment
Ordinance. However, the ordinance was adopted by Council and became effective on August 10,
2018, before the ?nal recommendation of November 2, 2018 and before the 016 initiated
debannent proceedings against the tow companies and its owners. Therefore, the City?s
Debarment Ordinance is applicable to the 2016 towing permits.

The Portions of Findings Whi_c__h Relied on the Wiretap Af?davit Was Proper

The 016? reviewed thousands of pages of documents including but not limited to court
?lings, permit applications, Michigan Licensing and Regulatory Affairs (LARA) ?lings, and
hearing transcripts. The 010?s recommendation was not solely based on the information contained
in the wiretap af?davit nor did we improperly rely on the information contained therein. As
you are well aware, during the July 27, 2018 Hearing on Motion for Preliminary Injunction in

Page 2 of 5

Joan Lucas v. City of Detroit, the Honorable Laurie J. Michelson ruled on the admissibility of the
wiretap af?davit. She ruled as follows:

Again, the wiretap evidence was publicly disclosed by the defendant
in the Celia Washington case, albeit, inadvertently. And again, that
was the criminal proceeding for which the wiretaps were authorized.
And the information sought to be introduced here regarding the
communications between Celia Washington and Gasper Fiore and
Gasper Fiore and Joan and Jennifer Fiore regarding the names of the
towing companies to be provided to Washington was publicly
revealed during the sentencing phase of that case. And as I
understand it, the information was also utilized during the preceding
before the Inspector General. So, there are not strong privacy
interests at stake here either. So, for those reasons, I am going to
DENY the Motion to 

Your client could have called those identi?ed on the wiretaps to testify at the administrative
hearing. However they chose not to. Therefore the 016 relied on the plain language contained in
the wiretap.

The OIG is Not Required to Subpoena Records ?ldf?l' Testimony Before Finding Lack of
Cooperation

Section 75-307 of the Charter states that ?[t]he Inspector General may subpoena witnesses,
administer oaths, take testimony, require the production of evidence relevant to a matter under
investigation, enter and inspect premises within the control of any city agency during regular
business hours.? (Emphasis added.) However, the 010 is not required to do so; it is at the
discretion of the Inspector General. Duty to cooperate is not required by a subpoena. The duty to
cooperate is required by the Charter. Therefore, requests for information and
documentation triggers the contractor?s duty to cooperate, not a subpoena.

The Proposed Years of Debarment for Javion Sams? 24 Hour Towing Service, Ines, Joan
Fiore; 3&0 Towing, Anthony Thomas; Gene?s Towing, Inc.: City Wide Towing, Inc.;

and Paul Ott Are Not Excessive or Inconsistent

The initiation of debarment proceedings is pursuant to the City of Detroit Debarrnent
Ordinance, not under state or federal law. The 01G does not have jurisdiction OVer state and/or
federal contractors. Likewise, neither federal nor state law concerning debarrnent is applicable or
controlling to the City. If contractors were concerned that the potential maximum debarment
period was excessive, they had the Opportunity to Oppose it at the public hearing. However, no
such opposition occurred. Further, if contractors are truly concemed about debarment and the
impact it could have on their businesses, they should not engage in conduct that would subject
them to the ordinance.

The 016?s proposed debarment period for your clients identi?ed above is just that, a
proposal. The Inspector General?s past recommendation of May 2018 was just an initial
recommendation based on the Inspector General?s initial ?ndings, before the administrative

Page 3 of 5

hearing. There is nothing inconsistent in the May 2018 recommendation and the 016?s ?nal report
and recommendation of November 2018, or the resulting initiation of debarment proceedings. The
OIG provided your clients due process in the administrative hearing. However, they chose not to
fully participate. Consistent with the commitment to providing due process, the parties
have the right to Oppose the debarment proceedings and the number of years proposed for the
debarment. Your clients exercised this right on Friday, November 30, 2018. As such, your clients
have the further right to appeal the ?nal recommendation under the ordinance to City
Council.

The ?gsis of the Proposed Debarment is the Result of the Findings from the Administrative
Hearing

You and your clients requested an administrative hearing on the initial
recommendation to preclude from bidding on the current Municipal Parking Department
and Detroit Police Department towing contracts. The purpose of the hearing was to permit your
clients an opportunity to present testimony and any supporting information in response to the 010?s
initial ?nding of May 2018. Prior to the hearing, during the hearing, and after the hearing, the 010
clearly stated to you the additional information your clients would need to submit to the OIG to
potentially overturn its recommendation. You elected not to ?illy cooperate. Thus, any ?nal
recommendation made by the OIG was based on the available information, including information made
available by the attorneys representing the tow companies.

Although the Debarment Ordinance does allow the Inspector General to issue an interim
suspension for up to ninety (90) days pending investigation, suspension is not required prior to
debarment initiation under the ordinance.

The Findings in the Final Recommendation Was Made Based on the Information
Made Available to the 01G.

Finally, the OIG ?nal report is supported by the entire record of information and by a
preponderance of the evidence presented to the OIG. You state in your response to the OIG that
its ??ndings of fact are not supported by evidence.? Yet no attempt was made by you or your
clients to specify any information contained in the ?nal report that is inaccurate. Further, no
additional information was provided to the OIG to consider and potentially amend the debarment
recommendation; this includes information previously requested by the 010 but not provided as
detailed in the administrative hearing report.

As such, the OIG is upholding its debarment recommendation for your respective clients.
Therefore, if you disagree with the 016?s recommendation of debarment or the length of
debarment, you may appeal to the Detroit City Council within 28 days of the date of this letter.
See Section of the Debarment Ordinance. To do so, you must send the appeal letter
together with any supporting materials to the City Clerk for transmission to City Council. See
Section 18-] l-11(b) of the Debarment Ordinance.
