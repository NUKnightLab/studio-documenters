Review and accept minutes of the meeting of July 28, 2009
Director Butler, seconded by Chairman Ansell, moved to accept the minutes of the meeting of the Quality
and Patient Safety Committee of July 28, 2009. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
__________________________

Receive quarterly quality report from Cermak Health Services
Dr. Avery Hart, Chief Medical Officer of Cermak Health Services, presented the quarterly quality report
(Attachment #1).
The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
__________________________

Receive report from System Interim Chief Medical Officer
• Update on draft recommendations for new System quality structure
• Update on the presentation of annual performance improvement plans
Dr. John Raba, Interim Chief Medical Officer of the Cook County Health and Hospitals System, presented
information on draft recommendations for a new System quality structure (Attachment #2). Additionally, he
presented an update on the presentation of annual performance improvement plans.
Dr. Raba referenced a meeting that was expected to take place later that day on the subject; it is expected that
the draft System quality structure will be finalized at this meeting. This draft structure includes a new entity, the
CCHHS Quality Council. Dr. Raba hopes that in October or November, the Quality Council will first review
the 2010 performance improvement plans from each System entity. These would then be presented to the
Committee and Board in December.
Chairman Ansell noted that the plans do not have to be submitted in one group inclusive of all System entities;
the presentations could be broken down into smaller groups.
Director Butler inquired regarding when Stroger Hospital is due for an accreditation visit. Sue Klein, Director
of Quality at John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County, responded that they can expect to be visited anytime
within the next year. Chairman Ansell remarked that Stroger Hospital was visited during a marked period of the
System’s transition to the new Board. He requested a report at the next Committee meeting on the subject of
Stroger Hospital’s state of readiness for the next Joint Commission visit.
On a separate matter relating to quality and benchmarks, Chairman Ansell stated that another piece of data that
will need to be discussed is the hospital mortality rates. He stated that, depending on what is used to
benchmark, one can get what is called “observed to expected mortality” based upon the kinds of cases seen.
This is part of the UHC packet of services, it should be obtainable. This allows one to take all of a patient’s
associated conditions, risk adjust, and come up with what the expected mortality rate should be with those
conditions.

Discussion continued on the subject; it was stated that UHC is inaccessible at this time. Chairman Ansell
requested that David Small, Chief Administrative Officer of the Cook County Health and Hospitals System,
investigate the issue of the delay in accessing UHC data.
