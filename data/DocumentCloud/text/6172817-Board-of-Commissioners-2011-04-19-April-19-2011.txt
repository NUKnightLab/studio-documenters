(Items A1)
The resolution for Item A1 approves extension of Contract No. 5059 with Stateway Associates,
LLC to continue to provide Community and Supportive Services (CSS) to the Stateway Gardens
Community. The provision of CSS at The Pershing and Park Boulevard was contemplated as
part of the competitive procurement of the developer and is governed by the Master Developer
Agreement with respect to this community. Based on funding availability and Stateway
Associates’ satisfactory performance, the contract will be extended for an additional one-year
period of May 1, 2011 to April 30, 2012. This will allow Stateway Associates to continue
providing services to the 81 families who have relocated to The Pershing and Park Boulevard
and provide services to the families desiring to relocate to the 46 units of Phase 2B, available in
2011. During the period of May 1, 2010 through February 28, 2011, Stateway Associates has
assisted 17 residents in subsidized employment placements, 3 residents in permanent job
placements, and 10 residents have completed digital literacy programming. Stateway Associates
assisted 13 households resolve lease compliance violations and have also assisted the aging-inplace senior population by completing 33 assessments and File for Life programs. During the
summer of 2010, Stateway Associates assisted in the placement of 28 youths in CHA sponsored
activities. Additionally, Stateway Associates continues to increase its rate of resident
engagement. Currently 75% of the residents at The Pershing and Park Boulevard are actively
engaged with Stateway Associates. CHA staff will continue to monitor and perform quality
assurance of the agency including, but not limited to, monthly performance reports, participant
file audits, quarterly monitoring visits with Stateway Associates, and on-going resident customer
satisfaction reviews. During the current contract term, Stateway Associates has improved the

THAT

the Board of Commissioners to authorize the Chief Executive Officer, or his

(Items A3)
The CHA released and advertised a Request For Proposal in November 2010 to solicit
consultants and firms to conduct an assessment of the senior population to better understand their
social service needs. The RFP was advertised in area newspapers and the CHA website and
BuySpeed. The CHA also directly solicited 386 firms, including 245 MBE/WBE/DBE firms.
The CHA received four proposals and based on the recommendation of the Evaluation
Committee all four firms were determined to be in the competitive range. Oral presentations
were held, and best and final offers were requested and submitted by each firm. Based upon the
evaluations of the written proposals, oral presentations, and the best and final offers, it was
determined that Housing Opportunities Unlimited (HOU) will provide the best overall service
and value to CHA to conduct this needs assessment. Accordingly, the resolution for Item A3
approves award of contract to HOU. The assessment of senior residents living in CHA housing
is a collaborative initiative with Chicago Department of Family and Support Services (DFSS).
CHA’s Resident Services Division will act as the implementation partner with HOU on behalf of
DFSS. HOU will be working with a subcontractor, the Collins Center for Public Policy, Inc., in
order to better understand the needs, characteristics and situations of this target population.
HOU will assess approximately 60% of seniors living in non-senior designated housing, and
approximately 20% of seniors living in senior-designated CHA housing. Upon completion of the
assessment, HOU will provide CHA with a detailed analysis to determine the characteristics,
barriers and service needs. The assessment and resulting analysis will allow CHA and DFSS to
determine how to better address the needs of this population.

meeting on Wednesday, April 13, 2011 at the CHA Corporate Offices.

Items B1 thru B6.
(Item B1)
The CHA advertised an Invitation for Bid in February 2011 for plumbing riser replacement at
838 N. Noble, Lidia Pucinska Apartments. The IFB was advertised in area newspapers, on the
CHA website, and on BuySpeed Online. Of the five bids received and opened, pre-award survey
meetings were held with the two lowest bidders. Both firms responded to questions on the
thoroughness of their bids, how they had developed their Division Costs, the amount of work
they planned to self-perform, whether any of the materials would be difficult to procure, and the
supervisory coverage they would provide at the work site. Due to the building being partially
occupied, considerable discussion was held regarding the logistics and timing of the work to
least inconvenience the residents. Based on the recommendation of staff, Burling Builders was
determined to be the lowest responsive and responsible bidder at $4,744,000.00. Accordingly,
the resolution for Item B1 approves award of contract to Burling Builders.

date set forth in the Notice to Proceed.
This award is subject to the Contractor’s compliance with the CHA’s

(Item B2)
As part of a Voluntary Compliance Agreement between the CHA and HUD to increase the
percentage of accessible units for persons with mobility impairments and the percentage of
sensory-accessible units, the CHA solicited bids for general contractors to perform ADA/504
conversion work in and around units in the Scattered Sites Program. The units were divided into
multiple Bid Groups to allow vendors with smaller staffs and limited licenses to participate by
bidding as few as a single Bid Group. Those vendors bidding all units were given the option to
pass along any economies of scale to the CHA by also submitting a Lump Sum Bid Total for all
of the properties included in the Bid Groups combined. The exterior work includes, but is not
limited to, the replacement or installation of ramps meeting ADA specifications, and replacing
damaged or cracked sections of the sidewalk. The interior work includes, but is not limited to,
replacing interior doors and frames with pre-hung doors, replacing base and wall hung cabinets,
installing new kitchen appliances, replacing damaged flooring and drywall, installing new light
fixtures, updating accessories in bathrooms, hanging new window blinds, install new water
heaters and furnaces, and update electrical outlets. This work will be done in compliance with
ADA specifications. The CHA advertised an Invitation for Bid (IFB) in December 2010 for
seven ADA/504 units (Bid Group 1). The IFB was advertised in area newspapers and on the
CHA website. Of the seven bids received and opened, seven pre-award survey meetings were
held with the apparent low bidder and second lowest bidder. Having completed its review of the
submitted bid materials, the responses at the pre-award survey meetings, and the
recommendations of staff, the resolution for Item B2 approves award of contract to Coleman
Development Corporation, the lowest responsive and responsible bidder for Bid Group 1.

(Item B4)
The resolution for Item B4 approves substitution of the Stateway Associates 2A, LLC as the
Development entity for the Park Boulevard 2A Rental Redevelopment. Stateway Associates
LLC was first approved by CHA in 2002 as the master developer to redevelop Stateway
Gardens. The members are Mesa Development LLC, Neighborhood Rejuvenation Partners,
L.P. (Davis Group), Walsh Ventures Management LLC, and Kimball Hill Stateway (Kimball
Hill). Since then, a new Park Boulevard community has been established on the former site with
the completion of two development phases, The Pershing and Park Boulevard 1B. In 2007, the
national housing market suffered an economic downturn which has also impacted the Park
Boulevard site. As a result of Kimball Hill’s position in the troubled housing market, Kimball
Hill filed for bankruptcy in April 2008. In order to quickly and without additional cost move the
6

 projected Park Boulevard Phase 2A development through the financing approval processes of the
City of Chicago, Department of Housing and Economic Development, and private lenders, the
remaining partners of Stateway Associates LLC have proposed to remove the Kimball Hill
Stateway entity from the partnership for Phase 2A, adjust the ownership apportions, and
substitute alternative entities. The entity substitutions and development ownership adjustments
includes the substitution of the Allison Davis Investment Trust (ADIT) for NRP Stateway (Davis
Group), and adding the JLM Investments IIA, LLC, (James Miller CEO of Stateway Associates),
and the redistribution of ownership percentages. These additional changes are being made to
more clearly identify the agreements between the partners and update the entities for the purpose
of developing Phase 2A. The substitution of ADIT for NRP Stateway is necessary because
Neighborhood Rejuvenation Partners, L.P., the sole member of NRP Stateway, is currently in the
process of liquidating its assets in accordance with the terms of its limited partnership agreement.
RESOLUTION NO. 2011-CHA-51
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated April 15, 2011,
requesting authorization to substitute Stateway Associates IIA, LLC as the
development entity for the Park Boulevard 2A rental development and execute
and deliver such other documents and perform such actions as may be necessary
or appropriate to implement the foregoing.
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to substitute Stateway Associates IIA, LLC as the development entity
for the Park Boulevard 2A rental development and execute and deliver such
other documents and perform such actions as may be necessary or appropriate
to implement the foregoing.

(Item B5)
In 1996, the CHA reached a settlement in a class action lawsuit that charged the CHA and HUD
with discrimination against Latinos in Chicago’s public housing programs. The court found that
Latinos had been deprived of housing assistance caused by actions and inactions on the part of
the CHA and HUD. The settlement resulted in the Latino Consent Decree which, among other
requirements, required the CHA to have two site offices, staffed at all levels with bilingual
personnel, to assist individuals seeking information about or wishing to register for CHA
programs. Though the 10-year agreement was lifted 6 years ago, in a spirit of good-faith along
with the progress made under the Latino Consent Decree, the CHA has continued to take
affirmative action in the form of marketing, intake and outreach to the Latino community. In
April 2009, the Board authorized the CHA to enter into Contract No. 9011 for a one year term
with a one year option. In February 2010, the Board authorized CHA to exercise the one year
option, which expired on February 28, 2011. Subsequently, CHA executed an amendment for
the first two month extension term, which expires on April 30, 2011. A three month extension of
the Contract is needed at this time as CHA has been trying to generate interest, and encourage
and develop competition and innovative service among qualified Latino serving organizations
for the new Latino Outreach and Site Offices Request for Proposals. Accordingly, the resolution
for Item B5 approves a three month contract extension with Spanish Coalition for Housing to
provide Latino Site Offices, Marketing, Intake and Outreach Services for the CHA.
RESOLUTION NO. 2011-CHA-52
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the
memorandum dated April 13, 2011 entitled, “AUTHORIZATION TO EXTEND
CONTRACT NO. 9011 WITH SPANISH COALITION FOR HOUSING FOR
THREE MONTHS TO PROVIDE LATINO SITE OFFICES- MARKETING,
INTAKE AND OUTREACH SERVICES FOR THE CHA”;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to extend Contract No. 9011 for the period of May 1, 2011 through July
31, 2011 in an amount not-to-exceed $125,262.00 to operate two (2) bilingual
(Spanish) Latino Site Offices in the Latino community to provide marketing,
intake and outreach for CHA programs and services.

 (Item B6)
The CHA’s Housing Choice Voucher Program serves over 36,000 families and over 16,000
landlords in the City of Chicago. CHA has three satellite offices that support the Housing
Choice Voucher Program by providing easily accessible services right in the heart of our city.
These offices are located at: 2750 W. Roosevelt Rd.; 1741-49, 1755-57 E. 75th St.; 10 W. 35th St.
Floor 5. CHA entered into the lease for the 35th St. premises commencing June 1, 2010 for an
initial term of one year. The current lease term expires on May 31, 2011. Accordingly, the
resolution for Item B6 approves a lease agreement for the premises located at 10 W. 35 th Street,
Floor 5, for the HCV Southwest Satellite Office under the existing terms.
RESOLUTION NO. 2011-CHA-53
WHEREAS, The Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the
Board Letter dated April 13, 2011, entitled, “AUTHORIZATION TO EXTEND
THE LEASE AGREEMENT WITH ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF
TECHNOLOGY (“ITT”) FOR THE PREMISES LOCATED AT 10 W. 35TH
STREET”
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer, or his
designee, to enter into a Lease Extension Agreement with the Illinois Institute of
Technology (“IIT”) for the Premises located at 10 W 35th St. 5th Floor, Chicago,
IL. The term of the Lease Extension Agreement will be for three (3) years
commencing June 1, 2011 and expiring May 31, 2014 at a Total Gross Rent
amount not to exceed $907,621.15. The Total Gross rent is exclusive of any
additional fees for operations outside the normal business hours and/or use of
additional facilities within the Building beyond those provided in the Lease and
the proportionate share of any assessed real estate taxes and/or special
assessments and utilities.

Per Commissioner Ivers, the Finance and Audit Committee held its regular meeting on
Wednesday, April 13, 2011 at the CHA Corporate Offices. The Chief Financial Officer and his
staff presented the committee with the March 2011 Treasury and Cash Flow Report and an
update from KPMG on Section 3 and Diversity Initiatives.
Commissioner Ivers then presented an Omnibus Motion for adoption of the Resolutions for
Items C1 thru C3. With respect to Commissioner Ivers’ Omnibus Motion for approval of Items
C1 thru C3, Chairman Reynolds presented an Amended Motion for approval of Items C1 and C2
only and presented another Motion to bifurcate Item C3 into two separate resolutions.
(Item C1)
The resolution for item C1 approves the revised 2011 Comprehensive Budget. The CHA is
required to submit for approval by the Board, a balanced annual Comprehensive Budget detailing
each of the following: General Fund, Section 8 Non-MTW, HOPE VI and Other Funding
Programs, and the use for these funds. The FY2011 budgeted expenditures have been revised
from $917,292,768 to $886,694,403 resulting in a $30,598,365 decrease. The major changes by
funding source are as follows: General Fund: Total revenues and associated expenditures
decreased by $41,888,243 for a fund total of $781,678,182. The reduction primarily reflects the
8

 “Hold” status for Altgeld Gardens Phase V, Cabrini Rowhouse Phase II and Dearborn capital
related site projects moved to FY2012, and delays in façade work at senior properties. Section 8
Non-MTW Fund: Total revenues and associated expenditures decreased by $1,374,162 for a
fund total of $6,729,336. This is due to a reduction in the average cost per voucher from $399.17
to $331.24 and a decrease in administration fees. Hope VI: Total revenues and associated
expenditures increased by $1,904,212 for a fund total of $39,655,170. The net change reflects a
decrease for closing delays at Park Boulevard along with increases in funding for development at
Oakwood Shores, West End II and Parkside II. Other Funding: The total revenues and
associated expenditures increased by $10,759,828 for a fund total of $58,631,715. This increase
reflects stimulus activity underway at Park Douglas and Pomeroy and surveillance camera work
at various CHA sites. Also, boiler replacement at Lake Parc Place and senior developments
contributed to the increase.
RESOLUTION NO. 2011-CHA-54
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board letter dated April 13, 2011,
entitled “APPROVAL OF THE REVISED 2011 COMPREHENSIVE
BUDGET”;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY

“THE FY2011 COMPREHENSIVE BUDGET AMENDMENT #1”, and finds
with respect to said Budget:
1.

2.

3.

THAT,

that the proposed expenditures are necessary for the efficient and
economical operation of the Chicago Housing Authority for the purpose of
serving low-income families;
that the financial plan is reasonable in that it indicates funding sources
adequate to cover all proposed expenditures, and does not provide for use
of Federal funding in excess of that payable under the provisions of the
applicable Federal regulations; and
that all proposed rental charges and expenditures will be consistent with
provisions of law and the Annual Contributions Contract in accordance
with the Amended and Restated Moving To Work Demonstration
Agreement of the Chicago Housing Authority with the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development.

the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are authorized to execute
and forward to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development all
necessary budget documents and supporting information when applicable.

(Item C2)
The CHA is required to contribute funds each year to the Plan based on the annual Actuarial
Valuation. For FY 2011, the CHA must contribute an estimated $5,300,000.00. The CHA
desires to make an additional contribution of $22,800,000.00 for 2011 to improve the funded
level of the Plan, which was 47.9% for year 2010 to approximately 77% for year 2011. If the
additional contribution is made this year, CHA’s annual contribution for 2011 will be an
estimated $3,700,000.00. Furthermore, it is projected that increasing the Plan’s funding by
$22,800,000.00 in 2011 will result in a total estimated $23,300,000 of cash savings/reduction of
expense in future annual CHA contributions to the Plan over the next 20 years from year 2011 to
year 2031, when it is anticipated the Plan will be fully funded. Without the additional
$22,800,000 of funding, CHA’s projected contributions to the Plan for 2011 through 2031 are
$162,000,000, but with the additional funding, the total contributions are projected to be
$138,700,000, resulting in the $23,300,000 CHA cash savings/reduction of expense.
Accordingly, the resolution for Item C2 approves a Year 2011 CHA contribution to the CHA
Employees’ Retirement Trust.
