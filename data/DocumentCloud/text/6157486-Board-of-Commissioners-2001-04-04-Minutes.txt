PROPOSED RESOLUTION

WHEREAS, many residential areas of Cook County are rapidly deve lopi ng, as evidenced by the recent
construction of many new property developments, condominium uni ts and subdivisions throughout the
County; and
WHEREAS, under current state law, a grantor may transfer ownership of a new res idential parcel to a
g rantee without providing a pro petty index number (PIN) and in fact, many of these newly built or newly
divided properties are sold prior to ass ignment of prope r property index num bers by the Cook County
Assessor; and
WHEREAS, the sale of parce ls that have not yet been divided by the Cook County Assessor's Office
leads to imprecise billing of individual property owners, which can resu lt in overpayments,
underpayments and penalties, creating confusion and frustration o n the part of these new homeowners;
and
WHEREAS, the resulting confusion and frustration of these homeowners severely strains the resources
of the Cook County Assessor's Office and the Cook County Commissioners; and

1219

which would require a grantor of property to provide the grantee with an individual permanent index
number that specifically represents that parcel of property which that grantee has purchased; and
WHEREAS, House Bill 2392 also provides that if the permanent index number does not represent the
legal description of the property, the grantor may supply proof that he or she either fil ed an application for
division of the property with the Cook County Assessor's Office, recorded a plat of subdivision, or
recorded a condominium declaration; and
WHEREAS, a grantor's failure to meet these requirements will not invalidate the transaction, but will

render a grantor personally liable to grantee for any taxes and attorney's fees that may be incurred until
the requirements are met.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Assessor's Office and the Cook
County Board of Commissioners support this legislation, recently passed unanimously by the House
Judiciary I Committee; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners does hereby urge the
Illinois State Legislature to support this effort to facilitate the payment of accurate property taxes by
residential property owners in Cook County ; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that th is text be spread upon the official proceedings of this Honorable

Body, and a suitable copy of same be provided to the Illinois State Legislature.
Commissioner Daley, seconded by Commissioner Steele, moved to suspend the rules so that this matter
may be considered. The motion carried unanimously.

238117

DOCKET #7074 - CHICAGO TITLE & TRUST AS TRUSTEE UTA #094089, c/o Kanzler

lntended use:
A self-propelled, track-mounted, portable rock crushing machine.

crushing operation as they had when the prior permit was issued.

Estates, located approximately 2,000 ft. west of the subject property. The mobile home community feels
that industrial zoning use no longer fits the community.

REVIEW OF CURRENT PLANS AND CONSIDERATION OF ALTERNATIVES
REGARDING THE TRAFFIC COURT/DOMESTIC VIOLENCE COURT FACILITY.
Transmitting a Communication, dated March 20, 200 I from John H. Stroger, Jr., President,
Cook County Board of Commissioners:
As you have no doubt heard or read, the Traffic Division of the Circuit Court operations
which were recently relocated to the Daley Center are running efficiently and in fact far more
smoothly than had been expected. After discussing this matter with various parties including
the Chief Judge of the Circuit Court, I now believe that there is a need to revisit plans to
construct a new Traffic Court/Domestic Violence Court facility. I am hereby requesting that
the County Board review current plans and give consideration to alternatives to satisfy the
