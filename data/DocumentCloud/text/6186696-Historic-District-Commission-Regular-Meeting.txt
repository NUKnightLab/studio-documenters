STAFF REPORT: 7-10-2019 MEETING
APPLICATION NUMBER: 19-6319
ADDRESS: 28 W. ADAMS
HISTORIC DISTRICT: BRUSH PARK
APPLICANT: JEFF HEFFENBLOWER
DATE OF STAFF VISIT: 7/6/2019

PREPARED BY: J. ROSS

PROPOSAL
As per the Detroit Historic Designation Advisory Board:
The building at 28 W. Adams, originally known as the Stroh Tower, is a twenty-story high-rise
structure clad in buff brick with limited terra cotta trim. More extensive terra cotta trim was
removed and replaced with buff brick when the building was remodeled in the 1950s. Its
aluminum storefronts and plate glass windows date from the 1970s. The windows at floors 3
through 18 are double-hung 3-over-1 units. Floors 19 and 20 were added in the 1950s replacing a
rooftop gazebo. These floors are clad in buff brick and aluminum panels in a simple utilitarian
style. The windows are aluminum. The building faces south onto Adams. The first and second
floors have a rectangular footprint measuring eighty feet four inches wide and one hundred feet
deep. Floors 3 through 18 are L-shaped with a light well at the northwest quadrant. A penthouse
at floors 19 and 20 is set back approximately two feet from the east, west, and south elevations
and approximately twenty feet from the north elevation with a roof-top veranda at the 19th floor.
The first and second floors have recently been renovated, and an awning from the 1970=s was
removed. The windows on the second story are now seen as they were originally, grouped into
four shallow bays with a center window flanked by two narrow windows. The center window
contains a divided window. At the second story, on each of the five piers is a bronze vertical
plaque containing a projecting lion’s head. These are the remnants of the building=s architectural
detail before the renovations removed the rest of it. The Elizabeth Street Annex, constructed in
1950, is ten stories in height and is comprised of six floors of office/service space above four
floors of parking. It is said to be the first International Style building in Detroit. The annex has a
rectangular footprint measuring 120 feet by ninety feet. It is clad in buff-colored brick with
aluminum ribbon windows at the north and south elevations. The annex has a simple aluminum
canopy at the entry to a small lobby at the northwest corner. The annex has no decorative trim. It
is connected to the Stroh Tower the south across an alley by a bridge connecting floors from 2
through 10.

Please note that at their December 12, 2018 regular meeting, the Detroit Historic District
Commission issued a Notice to Proceed for the demolition of 25 W. Elizabeth/the Elizabeth
Street Annex Building, which (as noted above) was erected in 1950 and is attached to the rear/
north elevation of 28 W. Adams. Specifically, please note that the Notice to Proceed allows
for the complete demolition of 25 W. Elizabeth, to include the current bridge which is
located at the building’s rear/south elevation and extends over the alley to connect it to the
rear/north elevation of 28 W. Adams. As the applicant notes, “currently the Grand Park
Centre Building and the adjacent building to north -Annex Building at 25 Elizabeth -are
connected by a 8 story tall bridge that connect levels 3 -10 of both buildings. This bridge
and the Annex building are slated to be demolished in the future as part of a separate
permit. Currently the second means of egress for the Grand Park Centre building runs
through the bridge and down the Annex building stairwell.” With the current proposal,
the applicant is seeking to address the condition of the rear/north elevation of 28 W.
Adams after the Elizabeth Street Annex Building and the connecting bridge are
demolished. Specifically, the current application proposes the following

 work items at the rear/north elevation of 28 W. Adams following the demo of the connector
bridge:
•
•
•
•
•

Repair and paint the existing fire escape (color not provided)
Install the new steel fire escape between levels 3-10, connect to existing fire
escape at level 11 and level 2. The submitted drawings indicate that the new
stair will match the existing in type/appearance (color new stairs not provided)
Cut in and install new fire rated egress doors at levels 3 -10 at the exterior wall
of the Grand Park Centre building at new fire escape landing location. The new
doors will be hollow metal (painted) with metal frames (color not provided)
Patch portion of exterior wall area between levels 3-10 with salvaged brick and
stucco (finish color of stucco not provided)
Install new light fixtures (details not provided)

STAFF OBSERVATIONS
As noted above, it will be necessary to “patch” the exterior wall at the rear elevation of 28 W.
Adams and extend the existing rear elevation fire escape once the 25 W. Elizabeth/Annex
Building’s connector bridge is demolished. Please note that the new building that will be erected
to replace 25 W. Elizabeth will rise 20 stories and will serve to conceal 28 W. Adams’s
rear/north elevation. Therefore, the work proposed in the current scope will not be visible from
the public-right-of-way.
ELEMENTS OF DESIGN
(7)
Relationship of materials. Building materials common to exterior surfaces in the
district are limestone, brick, granite and terra-cotta. Window frames are of wood,
cast iron, and/or steel. Modernizations tend to be in granite, glass and steel. The
church and church house exhibit slate roofs, copper flashing, dormer roofs, and
trim. Monuments and fountains feature bronze statues and plaques and marble
platforms or pedestals, sometimes with a granite base.
(8)

Relationship of textures. The low relief pattern of mortar joints in brick, terra
cotta or limestone juxtaposed with smooth masonry trim, where it exists, provides
textural interest. Glazed brick, glazed terra cotta, polished granite and large glass
surfaces are smooth in texture. Carved or molded repetitive ornamental detail in
terra cotta or masonry contrasts with the surface material, providing a high degree
of textural interest. Subdivided windows, parapets and cornices with repetitive
detail, where they still exist, are often areas of textural interest. The church and
church house have rock-faced ashlar surfaces that result in a rough, rustic
appearance. Their slate roofs create a pattern complimentary to the facades. In
general, the district is rich in textural relationships.

(9)

Relationship of colors. The majority of buildings in the Grand Circus Park Local
Historic District are in a light color range. Within this range, many are clad in
white or light beige terra cotta, while some are in light gray or beige limestone
and others are in buff brick. Red brick also exists. Window frames tend to be
painted in dark tones, such as black, brown or deep green, with a few in light

 tones, such as light gray. The church and church house have green copper
flashing and natural wood doors. Colorful stained glass windows provides artistic
interest to the church. Monuments and fountains feature verdigris or bronze-color
statues and plaques and white marble platforms or pedestals. The original colors
of any building, as determined by professional analysis, are always acceptable, and

may provide guidance for similar buildings.

RECOMMENDATION
It is staff’s opinion that the proposed work is consistent with the building’s historic character.
Staff therefore recommends that the Commission issue a Certificate of Appropriateness (COA) for
the work as proposed because it meets the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for
Rehabilitation standard number 2) The historic character of a property shall be retained and
preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and spaces that
characterize a property shall be avoided and 9) New additions, exterior alterations, or
related new construction shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the
property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be
compatible with the massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic
integrity of the property and its environment. However, staff does recommend that the
Commission issue the COA for the work with the following conditions:
•
•
•
•

•

All new brick shall match the existing/historic in dimension, motor color, finish color,
and texture
The new stucco shall be painted/finished a color that matches/blends in with the
adjacent historic brick
Staff shall be afforded the opportunity to review and approve the final specs for the
proposed exterior light fixtures, the final finish color of the fire escape, and the final
finish color of the new exterior doors
Staff shall be afforded the opportunity to review and approve any minor modifications
to the project scope. If staff determines that any such scope revision does not meet the
Secretary of the Interior’s Standards, the work item(s) shall be forwarded to the
Commission for review at a future meeting.
Staff shall be afforded the opportunity to review and approve the final project CDs prior
to the issuance of the permit

Brick building, steel fire escape

Description of Project
•

Currently the Grand Park Centre Building and the adjacent building to north -Annex Building at 25
Elizabeth -are connected by a 8 story tall bridge that connect levels 3 -10 of both buildings. This bridge
and the Annex building are slated to be demolished in the future as part of a separate permit. Currently
the second means of egress for the Grand Park Centre building runs through the bridge and down the
Annex building stairwell. The purpose of this permit is to extend the fire escape from level 11 to level 2
where it will connect to the existing level 2 fire escape landing and discharge. The existing fire escape will
be repaired as required and repainted. The exterior wall will be patched where the existing bridge tied
into the building.

•
•
•
•
•

Cut in and install new fire rated egress doors at levels 3 -10 at the exterior wall of the Grand Park Centre
building at new fire escape landing location.
