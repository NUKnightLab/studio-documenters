approximately 120 students in grades 11-12 with approximately 60 students coming from Dunbar and
approximately 60 students from citywide enrollment. A similarly sized cohort will be added each
consecutive year. Dunbar student participation will be at Dunbar as part of the regular school day.
Citywide student participation will occur at Dunbar at the end of their regular school day.

CURRICULUM: All students at Chicago Builds will enroll in training?level coursework that prepares them
for postsecondary success. in addition, Chicago Builds will collaborate with the Of?ce of College and
Career Success (0008). as well as post-secondary and industry partners to provide every student with
exposure to, and the opportunity to earn credentials towards careers in the trades. Chicago Builds will
feature multiple career tracks within the trades: carpentry, electricity, HVAC-R (heating, ventilation, air
conditioning, refrigeration), and welding.

ENROLLMENT: For selecting eligible incoming junior and senior students to be served in the 2016-2017
school year, the application process allowed an application window of April 25, 2016 through June 13,
2016. All eligible students will be served unless there are more eligible students than available seats in
which case, a lottery will be held giving students with a minimum of a 2.0 unweighted GPA and 80%
attendance preference for selection over other eligible students.

The CEO or designee is authorized to develop procedures and guidelines on subsequent admission and
continued participation in Chicago Builds. The CEO or designee may also issue revised or updated
procedures and guidelines as necessary for the effective implementation of an AVC.

TRANSPORTATION: Reduced fare cards may be provided to citywide students for daily travel to and
from Dunbar.

PERSONNEL IMPLICATIONS: The AVC will be staffed in accordance with Board staffing formulas and
job posting procedures for all positions. Unique teacher training, professional development, skills,
abilities, pro?ciencies, experience, and quali?cations may apply to some teacher positions and may be
required for educational support personnel.

FINANCIAL: The programs offered at the AVG will be staffed via funding from CPS Central Office with
supplemental funding from OCCS as permitted from the Perkins grant. Other ?nancial implications will be
assessed as part of the FY17 budget process and that subsequent appropriations are subject to Board
