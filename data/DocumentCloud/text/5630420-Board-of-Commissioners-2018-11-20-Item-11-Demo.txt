Background
The Building Demolition: The CHA Board previously approved the CHA entering into a land
transfer intergovernmental agreement (IGA) with the City of Chicago (City) and the
Chicago Park District (CPD) on November 13, 2013 (Resolution No. 2013-CHA-101). CHA
entered into the IGA in 2014. This IGA stipulated that the City would convey and CHA
would acquire the Near North High School and adjacent field (collectively referred to as
“the NNHS Property”) at 1450 -1500 North Larrabee Street in exchange for CHA
transferring to the City a portion of CHA-owned land that was formerly the Harold Ickes
Homes development. The City, thereafter, conveyed the acquired Harold Ickes Homes
property to the Chicago Board of Education for the construction of a new artificial turf field
and running track for Jones College Prep High School.
On August 17, 2015, the City conveyed the NNHS Property to CHA. This property is part of
the revitalization of the former Cabrini-Green development community and is included in
the Cabrini Consent Decree.
The 1500 North Larrabee ballfield is currently being leased by several community sports
organizations until such time the CHA will transfer the property to the CPD. CPD will own
and operate the park for the community to utilize and enjoy.
The 1450 North Larrabee property will be utilized for mixed-income residential
development and retail/commercial development. CHA intends to demolish the Near
North High School building to prepare the site for the redevelopment activities.
Demolition activity at the site is anticipated to commence by the end of 2018.
CHA and the City will enter into an IGA for CHA to receive $4 million from the Near North
Tax Increment Financing (TIF) district. Funds from the TIF will be used to pay for the
demolition activities associated with the Near North High School building.
CHA will also enter into an Additional Services Agreement with Near North Cabrini, LLC,
the developer for the NNHS Property, to cause the developer to perform the demolition
activities at the site on behalf of CHA. The developer team will coordinate the demolition
planning activities which will save the project money and time. Under the existing Contract
2

 for Redevelopment of the Cabrini Green DZP Site 1, executed February 23, 2018 between
CHA and Near North Cabrini, LLC, the developer may provide additional services directly
to CHA as requested.
The redevelopment of this land was planned through the Near North Working Group and
is included in the Development Zone Plan, a framework for the Cabrini redevelopment
activities.
The Predevelopment Loan: On December 31, 2015, the City of Chicago’s Department of
Planning and Development (DPD) released a Request for Proposals (RFP) on behalf of the
Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) under the stipulations of the Cabrini Green Consent
Decree entered into on August 30, 2000. The RFP invited submissions of proposals for
three (3) specific sites at the Cabrini Green area for Development Teams through a Request
of Proposals (RFP) for the planning, design, finance, development and management of
mixed-income/mixed-use development. The deadline for final responses was June 29,
2016.
The Hunt Development team was selected for the Clybourn and Larrabee site. The CHA
Board previously approved Hunt Development Group as the developer for Clybourn and
Larrabee on February 21, 2017 (Resolution No. 2017-CHA-23).
The overall redevelopment plan for this site consists of public housing units, affordable
units and market rate units (and contain approximately 32,900 square feet of
retail/commercial space) and a homeownership portion. At a minimum, the Development
will contain approximately 482 newly constructed units including approximately 183 public
housing units, approximately 71 rental non-public housing affordable units, approximately
142 rental market rate units, approximately 11 affordable (including 4 Choose to Own)
homeownership units, and 75 market rate homeownership units. The Homeownership
Development may include townhomes, multi-unit buildings or condominium units in a
multi-story building consisting of market rate units, affordable units and (public housing)
units.
The first phase planned is a 21-story high rise building with approximately 190 units of
which approximately 84 units will be for CHA residents (44% of total units), and the
remaining will be affordable and market rate. Redevelopment will begin at the
southernmost tip of the redevelopment site.
