Projects
7.Liv Building Brownfield Redevelopment Plan
Ms. Maxwell presented the 7.Liv project for review and consideration. A PowerPoint presentation
provided renderings and maps. The developer, Matt Hessler, answered questions about potential
commercial tenants, green building features, the residential units and project timing.

Project Introduction
Bagley Forest Property, LLC is the project developer (the “Developer”) for the Plan which entails
one parcel totaling .57 acres and is developed with an approximately 26,000 square foot building
constructed in 1940, with additions constructed in 1949 and 1951. The developer intends to
demolish the structure at the corner of Livernois and Seven Mile (approximately 10,000 square
feet), with the other two structures to remain. A new structure will be constructed to replace the
corner building and orient storefronts along Livernois, while creating cohesiveness with the
remaining single story structure.
The final use will serve as an active, living environment servicing the needs of the community
through mix of retail, commercial eatery/café, and multi family dwelling units catered to the local
student population. The B. Siegel Department Store will remain and serve as the anchor retail
store for the development. The residential component will consist of three studio apartments, one
1-bedroom apartment and six 2-bedroom apartments. A total of 20,500 square feet will be
reserved for retail and restaurant uses. Potential identified tenants include a clothing retailer, a
coffee shop and a yoga studio. An underground parking garage will be added to the property
beneath the B.Siegel Department Store and the corner building to provide residential tenant and
commercial tenant employee parking.
It is estimated that 27 temporary construction jobs will be created and 30 additional permanent
jobs are expected to be created by prospective tenants. Total investment is expected to be
approximately $8,000,000.00. The Developer is requesting $1,847,301.00 in TIF reimbursement
under the proposed Plan.

 Property Subject to the Plan
The eligible property (the “Property”) consists of a single (1) parcel containing only the B. Siegel
Building located at 19031 Livernois Avenue in the Bagley Community on the western border of
the University District of Detroit.
Basis of Eligibility
The property is considered “eligible property” as defined by Act 381, Section 2 because (a) the
property was previously utilized for a commercial purpose; (b) it is located within the City of Detroit,
a qualified local governmental unit under Act 381; and (c) the Property is determined to be a
“facility” as described in Part 201 of the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act,
1994 PA 451, MCL 321.20101 to 324.20142 (“Part 201”).
Eligible Activities and Projected Costs
The “eligible activities” that are intended to be carried out at the Property are considered “eligible
activities” as defined by Sec 2 of Act 381, because they include baseline environmental
assessment activities, due care activities and infrastructure improvements and the development
and preparation of brownfield plan and /or work plan. The eligible activities and budgeted costs
are intended as part of the development of the Property and will be financed solely by the
Developer. The Authority is not responsible for any costs of eligible activities and will incur no
debt. The eligible activities are estimated to begin in the winter of 2017 and be complete within
two years.
Tax Increment Financing (TIF) Capture
The Developer desires to be reimbursed for the costs of eligible activities. Tax increment revenue
generated by the Property will be captured by the DBRA and used to reimburse the cost of the
eligible activities completed on the Property after approval of this Plan pursuant to the terms of a
Reimbursement Agreement with the DBRA.

the terms of the Reimbursement Agreement.
Attached for your review and approval are three (3) resolutions: 1.) a resolution supporting the
Plan Amendment in the event the Committee does not deem it necessary to conduct a CAC public
hearing and 2.) a resolution authorizing a public hearing in the project area and 3.) a resolution
