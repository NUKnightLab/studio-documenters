OF THE

COMMISSIONERS OF THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY

April 16, 2002

The Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority held its Regular meeting on Tuesday, April
16, 2002 at 8:30 a.m. at Altgeld Murray Community Building, located at 951 East 132nd Street in
Chicago.

Also present were Terry Peterson, Chief Executive Officer; Gail Niemann, General Counsel;
Chicago Housing Authority Staff Members and the General Public.
There being a quorum present, the meeting duly convened and business was transacted as follows:
The Chairperson convened the Public Hearing portion of the meeting by inviting residents and the
public at large to address the Board.
Immediately following the Public Hearing Session, Terry Peterson, Chief Executive Officer,
presented his monthly report. Mr. Peterson then provided the public with a detailed report on OneStrike law. According to Mr. Peterson, a recent ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court upheld onestrike laws in public housing agencies throughout the country. Per Mr. Peterson, the one-strike law
is very clear: if you are engaged in any criminal activity, you will lose your right to live in public
housing. Mr. Peterson informed the Commissioners that with the help of the Chicago Police,
resident leaders and tenants working side-by side, he will continue to work hard to eliminate the
criminal activity throughout the CHA. Mr. Peterson concluded his report by saying that the onestrike law remains one of CHA’s most effective tools in providing a safe environment for lawabiding resident and that the existing CHA process was negotiated with resident leaders as well as
their attorneys to ensure that the process was both fair and compassionate.
A motion was the n introduced and seconded to adjourn to Executive Session. The Chairperson
announced that pursuant to the Open Meetings Act, 5 ILCS 120/2, the Board would adjourn for
approximately one (1) hour to discuss pending, probable or imminent litigation, collective
negotiating matters, security and personnel matters.

increase the cumulative not-to-exceed amount of four construction management contracts with
Tishman Construction, Gilbane Construction, Jones/Brown and Momen and Pacific Construction.

Construction, Gilbane Construction, Jones/Brown Environmental, Globetrotters Engineering, and
