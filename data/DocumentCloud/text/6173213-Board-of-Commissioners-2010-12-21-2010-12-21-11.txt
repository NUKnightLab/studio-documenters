GENERAL BACKGROUND
As part of the Capital Maintenance Program, the Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) solicited

Green St., 3124 S. Green St. and 3130 S. Green St. The interior Scope of Work includes the
creation of two (2) new ADA accessible units. For each ADA unit, the bottom floors of two (2)
side-by-side duplex row houses will be joined together into a single street level unit. The upper
levels of the row houses will also be joined together to provide a single “flat-style” unit. All units
will receive new kitchens, bathrooms and mechanical, electrical and plumbing upgrades. In all of
the units, the existing drywall will be patched and painted and the light fixtures, tub surrounds,
range hoods, and selected doors will be replaced. On the outside, selected shrubbery will be
removed or replaced and designated concrete landings and patios will be replaced. Concrete
walks and ramps will be installed and brick infill work performed. In addition, selected windows,
sills and doors will be upgraded.
PROCUREMENT HISTORY
The CHA advertised Invitation for Bid (IFB) No. 10 – 00603 on September 20, 2010 for capital
maintenance work needed in and around Buildings 3, 4 and 6 (Group 2) at Bridgeport Homes.
The IFB was advertised in the Chicago Sun-Times, the Chicago Defender, El Dia, on the CHA
website and on BuySpeed Online.
The Pre-bid meeting and Site Visit were held on September 24, 2010. The CHA issued
Addendum No. 1 on October 13, 2010. It changed the bid submittal date from October 14, 2010
to October 22, 2010. Addendum No. 2 was issued October 15, 2010 to answer Requests for
Information, and distributed selected revised and new drawings and technical specification
sections, and release updated BF pages.
The CHA received and opened five (5) bids on October 22, 2010.
After reviewing the bid submittal materials, the Department of Procurement and Contracts and
the Capital Construction Department held a pre-award survey meeting with Maxwell Services,
Inc., the apparent low bidder. The firm responded to questions on the thoroughness of its bid, the
amount of the work it planned to self-perform, and its capacity to perform this work. The firm’s
proposed project team was reviewed and its projection of a longer lead-time for several materials

procedures.
After reviewing the submitted bid materials and its responses at the pre-award survey meeting,
the Department of Procurement and Contracts has determined that Maxwell Services, Inc. is the
lowest responsive and responsible bidder.

authorize the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to execute a contract with Maxwell
Services, Inc. in the amount of $806,486.00 for capital maintenance work at the ten (10) in and
around Buildings 3, 4 and 6 (Group 2) at Bridgeport Homes (IL2-004). Work is to be completed

from the date set forth in the Notice to Proceed, except for exterior landscaping and site work,
which shall be completed by no later than June 1, 2011.
