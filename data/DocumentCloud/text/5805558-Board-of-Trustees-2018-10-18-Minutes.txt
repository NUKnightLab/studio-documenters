Resolution Honoring Board of Trustees President Jay C. Rehak’s and Vice President
Lois W. Ashford’s Service to the Public School Teachers’ Pension and Retirement Fund of
Chicago
WHEREAS, State legislation effective July 1, 1895, established the first pension system in Illinois and the
second in the nation, designed to ensure the financial stability and dignity of teachers in retirement; and
WHEREAS, under the governance of the Chicago Board of Education, The Public School Teachers’
Pension and Retirement Fund of Chicago had difficulty developing a sustainable model which would provide long-term financial security for its members; and
WHEREAS, the financial crisis in the pension fund became an issue of social justice championed by activist and reformer Jane Addams, known as the “mother” of social work, elected to the Pension Board as
president on August 30, 1905; and
WHEREAS, Addams fought for the Pension Reform Act of 1907, which set the groundwork for financial
stability in the pension fund and granted teachers control over governance by establishing an independent
board including 6 active teacher representatives, a structure which has remained in place for 111 years; and
WHEREAS, in the tradition of the activist educators and reformers who have come before them, teachers Jay C. Rehak and Lois W. Ashford, founders of the Chicago Teachers Union Caucus of Rank and File
Educators (CORE) movement, sought election for the position of Teacher Trustee in 2009; and

 OCTOBER 18 304 2018

WHEREAS, they achieved a majority vote in their election, took their Oaths of Office on November 17,
2009, swearing to support the Constitution of the United States, the Constitution of the State of Illinois, and
committed to faithfully discharge the duties of a Trustee, and they were re-elected to the Teacher Trustee
position in 2012 and 2015; and
WHEREAS, on November 17, 2011, their peers elected Trustee Rehak to the position of President and
Trustee Ashford to the position of Vice President, creating a leadership partnership fondly referred to as
J-Lo, and have continued in those positions annually for the past six years; and
WHEREAS, Trustee Rehak and Trustee Ashford in their capacity and executing their duty as fiduciaries,
participated in more than 200 public meetings of the Trustees, investment committee, and multiple other
committee assignments, volunteering thousands of hours; and
WHEREAS, Trustee Rehak notably proposed the creation of and led the Communications Committee, and
Trustee Ashford served as the long-time Chair of the Pension Law and Administrative Rules Committee;
and
WHEREAS, during the past nine years as they served tirelessly and always in the best interest of members,
the Fund has succeeded in ensuring the financial stability of the organization and improving services to
members, while strengthening administration of the organization; and
WHEREAS, understanding the critical importance of stable revenue, Trustees Rehak and Ashford have
successfully led the Trustees’ fight for full funding from the Chicago Board of Education, ending more than
a decade of pension holidays and exacting full payments from the Chicago Board of Education for the past
four years, bringing vital revenue to the Fund; and
WHEREAS, the Chicago Teachers’ Pension Fund (CTPF) is governed by Illinois law and during the past
nine years, the Trustees have looked to the State of Illinois for equitable funding, successfully working
with members of the Illinois legislature to ensure the passage of Public Act 99-521 in 2016, restoring the
tax levy lost in 1995 when those funds were redirected to the operating budget of the Chicago Board of
Education; and
WHEREAS, additional landmark legislation introduced with the advocacy of the CTPF Board of Trustees,
the 2017 Public Act 100-465 changed the Illinois education funding formula, and for the first time in history established the State of Illinois’ obligation to fund the normal cost of Chicago’s teacher pensions and a
$65 million contribution toward retiree health insurance costs, reducing long-standing inequities in funding
for Chicago’s teachers; and
WHEREAS, one of the primary responsibilities of the CTPF Trustees has been to set sound and responsible investment policy, and during the past 10 years, the Trustees faced some of the most challenging economic conditions in history, the policies they championed successfully guided the Fund through the Great
Financial Crisis, mitigating asset losses by implementing many defensive strategies, and achieving a longterm 7.85% 25-year net return, exceeding the Fund’s benchmarks and actuarial assumption; and
WHEREAS, Trustees Rehak and Ashford led the Board of Trustees during a period when it has been consistently recognized as being at the forefront in providing opportunities to minority-, women-, and persons
with disabilities-owned investment firms, increasing diverse investments from 23.6% in 2008 to 42% or
$4.5 billion with diverse managers in 2018; and

 OCTOBER 18 305 2018

WHEREAS, the Trustees have firmly established CTPF as a forward-thinking, long-term strategic investor with a socially responsible focus, resolutions supporting divestment in non-military automatic weapons
manufacturers, the Country of Sudan, and private prison and immigrant detention centers have highlighted
the power that the investor community has to demand greater accountability from public and private companies who make products and provide services that may be detrimental to the health of the Fund and the
well-being of members and the greater community; and
WHEREAS, CTPF’s excellent financial stewardship, accountability, and financial transparency of public funds has been consistently recognized by the Government Finance Officers Association of the United
States and Canada with the awarding of a prestigious Certificate of Achievement for Excellence in Financial
Reporting; and
WHEREAS, during their tenure CTPF has dedicated resources to developing the Fund’s customer service
functions and communications, expanding the Member Services Department, creating additional space for
Member Counseling, organizing a Communications Department, launching an email program, and organizing a significant social media presence necessary to meet the needs of current and future members;
THEREFORE, the Public School Teachers’ Pension and Retirement Fund of Chicago hereby resolves, as
follows:
1.  That Trustees Rehak and Ashford, as leaders and fiduciaries of the Chicago Teachers’ Pension
Fund, have served their Fund, constituents, community profession, and citizens of Illinois with
distinction for the past nine years.
2.  That as President and Vice President of the CTPF Board of Trustees, their work has restored
