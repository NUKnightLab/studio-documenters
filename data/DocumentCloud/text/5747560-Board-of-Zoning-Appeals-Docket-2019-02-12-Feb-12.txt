a new 4,436 square foot one-story structure on a 13,635 square

the Board, it is found that such modification is necessary to secure
an appropriate development of a specific parcel of land, provided,
that any such modification will not be inconsistent with other
requirements and general purpose of this Zoning Ordinance; and
for a variance of the minimum required setbacks. Also, deficient
off street parking; deficient residential screening, Dumpster
