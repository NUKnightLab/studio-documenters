PROPOSAL:

Secure Realty, LLC request variances TO convert an
existing single-family dwelling into a six-unit Multiple
Family Dwelling with Accessory Parking Approved with
conditions in BSEED Case #69-18 in an R2 zone (Two Family

a maximum of eight (8) dwelling units, except where
developed under the “School building adaptive reuses”
provision as defined in Sec. 61-16-171 of this Code;, the
petitioner is requesting 10 units; there are several
dimensional variances needed – Lot size required 7000 sq.
ft. - 5,489 proposed; Side Lot Setback required 10 ft. – 0
proposed west property line; Rear Setback required 39 ft.

PROPOSAL:

JAR Capital, LLC appeals the decision of the Buildings Safety
Engineering and Environmental Department’s Special Land Use Review
dated February 6, 2019 which states; the subject property has been
identified as being within 1000 radial feet of a Drug Free Zone in a M4
INTENSIVE INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT). This case is appealed because
Appeals to the Board of Zoning Appeals may be taken by any person,
firm, partnership or corporation, or by any City department, commission,
board or other City agency which is aggrieved 1) by a decision of an
enforcing officer, or 2) by any decision made by the Buildings and Safety
Engineering Department involving Conditional Uses. Also, the Buildings,
Safety Engineering, and Environmental Department shall not approve
any request under this Chapter for a medical marihuana caregiver center
in a Drug Free Zone. The locational specifications related to drug-free
zones of subsection 354(b)(1) of this section may not be waived or
modified by the Buildings, Safety Engineering and Environmental
Department, nor the Board of Zoning Appeals. Applications that are not
consistent with the locational specifications of subsection (b)(1) of this
section shall be considered ineligible and shall be dismissed. Also, the
proposed MMCC located at 611 Hillger has been identified as being in a
Drug Free Zone (DFZ) based on its proximity to Pathways Academy
located at 11200 (aka 11340) E. Jefferson.. Pathways Academy is a
legally, operating, public charter school located approximately 539 radial
feet from the subject property at 611 Hillger, therefore becomes ineligible
to establish a Medical Marihuna Growers Faculty (Sections 61-4-72
Appeals and 61-3-355 Permitted districts for medical marihuana facilities;
Conditional Uses; Restrictions(c)(d).).AP

John Rogers request to construct a seven space surface parking lot on
the 4,095 square foot lot which will serve an adjacent multiple-family
dwelling owned by the applicant located at 19000 Chalmers in a R2
(TWO-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT). This case is appealed because
the Board of Zoning Appeals shall be authorized to hear dimensional
variance requests for matters that are beyond the scope of Buildings
and Safety Engineering Department ten percent (10%) administrative
adjustments where, after investigation by the Board, it is found that such
modification is necessary to secure an appropriate development of a
specific parcel of land, provided, that any such modification will not be
inconsistent with other requirements and general purpose of this Zoning
Ordinance; Sec. 61-14-222. Residential screening – the width of the
proposed lot is inadequate for the parking spaces, aisle and required
setback from the adjacent residentially-zoned property. (Sections 61-491(1) General Dimensional Standard (Parking), Sec. 61-14-222,
Residential screening and 61-4-81 Approval Criteria).AP
