Dear Council President Jones:

I am pleased to submit this quarterly report on behalf of the Detroit Land Bank Authority. The
DLBA programs continue to work together to strengthen Detroit?s housing market and increase
overall property values. Year over year, average multiple listing sale prices increased 22% between
2017 and 2018. In 2018, there were 1,221 mortgages issued within Detroit compared to only 490
in 2017, further evidence that the housing market in our city continues to improve. The sale of lots
and structures conducted by the DBLA are an important component of this trend.
Some key highlights of our work this quarter include:
INVENTORY
0 4,997 new side lots were made available for sale by working with the Tax Assessor's
Office to clear thousands of erroneous tax bills, and through board approval of
increasing allowable lot size to 7500 square feet.
a 2628 walk-in clients were served Clients served
a 16,783 were answered
a Call center answer rate remains above 90 percent for C12.
I Call center abandoned rate remains below 8 percent for Q2.

DETROIT LAND BANK AUTHORITY

INVENTORY DEPARTMENT OVERVIEW

ROBERT LINN, INTERIM DIRECTOR OF INVENTORY

 

Since its founding in 2008, during the height of the housing crisis, the DLBA has been a key vehicle
in the City?s effort to promote vibrant neighborhoods and combat property abandonment. At
inception, the land bank emphasized returning properties to productive reuse through a limited
program of home rehabilitation. In 2013, however, the land bank's charge grew to include broader
neighborhood interventions and a role as the city?s owner of last resort for abandoned
property. Towards these ends, the DLBA went on to accept more than 110,000 parcels from a
variety of other public agencies, including nearly 55,000 from the City of Detroit. Some of these
properties had been in public ownership since The Great Depression, underscoring the need for a
singular organization focused on returning properties to productive reuse.

The Detroit Land Bank Authority?s Inventory Department oversees the acquisition, assessment,
and pipeline assignments for all parcels under the legal control of the DLBA per in the land bank?s
inventory. This department encapsulates and facilitates a diverse collection of functions that,
together, propel properties smoothly through the inventory assessment pipeline; returning
them to productive reuse. Currently, the department encompasses six divisions, each with unique
roles and responsibilities.

- Acquisition: Facilitates ?owner of last resort? obligations through accepting transfers from
other government agencies the City, State, and County Treasurer, voluntary donations
from financial institutions and private residents.

I Data Management: Oversees the data analysis, including creating thematic maps,
demographic and market analyses, and maintaining DLBA internal and external data
integrity, including collaboration with City partners to share necessary real estate data,
supporting projects led by City departments. Administering the vetting and listing process
for side lot sales and other Disposition programs.

- Inventory Management: Facilitates appropriate pipeline assignment using available
market, condition, and resident inquiry information to assess and determine whether DLBA
structures should be demolished or sold. If the property is salvageable, staff work to pair
the property with the appropriate Disposition program to maximize return to productive
reuse. Additional corollary functions include monitoring inventory for condition changes,
oversight of structure and lot maintenance, coordinating structure inspections, and
creating sale listings

I Project Management: Coordinates DLBA activities with City agencies including, but not
limited to, the Planning and Development Department (PDD), Housing and Revitalization
Department (HRD), and Department of Neighborhoods, to ensure the organization's
efforts are supportive and collaborative of City strategies. Oversees participation in many
interagency projects, including but not limited to, Bridging Neighborhoods Project, 
neighborhood studies, and the General Services Department's park expansion planning
effort.

- Client Services: Handles client communication for the organization by responding to
resident in-person inquiries at the DLBA offices and through calls placed to the
organization?s main phone line.

I Title Services: Oversees title, tax, and utility clearances for structures and lots prepared
for disposition. The team inventories and resolves delinquent tax bills, outstanding water
accounts, liens, and other encumbrances before sale to provide insurable title and
minimize issues for purchasers. Towards these ends, the team also batches properties for
quiet title.

ACQUISITION

The second quarter of 2019 was notable due to the increase in donations and decrease in
foreclosures. 75 parcels accepted as donations during the Second quarter of 2019 surpassed Q4
2017 as the busiest quarter ever; continuing a long general growth pattern for this program.
Though donations represent a relatively small number of parcels, they often come from
institutional investors and financial institution inventories and can be difficult for residents to
access. Consequently, the DLBA believes this program is a means of improving resident access to
land.

This year?s transfer of unsold 2018 tax foreclosures from the Wayne County Treasurer?s office
included 348 structures and 102 vacant lots, marking a sharp decline. Through the confluence of
increasing prevailing tax payment rates, foreclosure prevention efforts, participation in the City?s

right-of?refusal program, and purchaser demand at the foreclosure auction, the number of unsold
foreclosures accepted by the DLBA declined by 73.82% between calendar years 2017 and 2018.

DATA MANAGEMENT
In furthering the DLBA's objective to return properties to productive reuse, Data Management
placed special focus on two issues this quarter: improving resident access to side lots, and

understanding of the city?s housing market.

Through DLBA Inventory efforts, 4,997 new side lots were made available in C12 2019. A close
partnership with the Office of the Assessor cleared thousands of erroneous tax bills on DLBA
inventory, allowing previously-encumbered lots to be made available for disposition. Data
Management staff also supported a policy revision process that culminated in the approval of an
increased maximum allowable side lot size to 7,500 square feet; increasing side lot Disposition
program eligibility.

Understanding the city?s housing market is paramount in returning properties to productive use.
Through detailed analysis, staff intend to target DLBA programs, respond rapidly to property
changes, and to identify new programmatic opportunities. To date, two high level trends stand
out. First, despite increased national economic uncertainty, Detroit?s housing market remained
quite strong this quarter. Year over year, overall average sale prices among private market sales
listed through the MLS increased 22% between calendar year 2017 and calendar year 2018, with
traditional neighborhoods outperforming the greater downtown area. Since 2014, the market
change has been even more dramatic, as evidenced by the map below.

Second, the close of the second quarter of 2019 marked an important milestone in the city?s
market; for the first time in more than a decade, the city recorded more than a thousand new
purchase mortgage originations during a single calendar year. The 1,271 mortgages in calendar
year 2018 are a strong sign of market improvement, and increased confidence in the city?s housing
market among financial institutions.

Continuing the trend reported last quarter, sales have dramatically outpaced acquisitions,
resulting in decreased DLBA inventory. The DLBA expects this trend to continue forthe foreseeable
future.

Through acquisition, demolition, and disposition, the composition of inventory is in
constant flux. Housing demand and demolition activity are disproportionately concentrated in
Hardest Hit Fund areas. Consequently, the inventory is slowly, but 
from structures in Hardest Hit Fund areas to vacant lots outside of Hardest Hit Fund Areas.

INVENTORY MANAGEMENT

Inventory Management combines property condition information, zoning, market data,
neighborhood plans, and resident input to determine the best strategy for returning properties to
productive use. The team prepares properties sold through the Auction and Own?It-Now
programs, determines the sales schedule, and creates the website listings. Auction properties are
cleaned out and Property Condition reports generated providing potential buyers a minimum cost
of repairs. In addition to managing DLBA property maintenance both proactively and in response
to constituent complaints.

INVENTORY DISPOSITION PIPELINE

The 27,610 structures move through Inventory?s intake, assessment, maintenance,
analysis, and programmatic identification pipelines. Structures in the Rehabbed Ready, Auction,
and Own?It?Now pipelines include currently for sale, and those identified, but not yet up for sale.
Occupied properties include properties in the Buy Back program, as well as those reviewed for Buy
Back or another occupied sales program eligibility. These programs are managed by the 
Disposition Department. Properties reviewed for possible sale outside primary disposition
programs are given ?Projects? status. Projects currently include Community Partners Program and
Bridging Neighborhoods Program. ?Salvage? structures are those determined to be salvageable but
not currently prepared for sale. If a member of the public indicates Interest in purchasing a
property identified as ?Salvage,? the DLBA will further vet the property for potential sale.

During Summer 2018, the DLBA inspected nearly 7,000 properties located outside of HHF areas.
Using this new information, these properties were assigned to the appropriate pipelines and
assessed on a per-property basis for sale/rehab or demolition. using data gathered in these recent
inspections, the DLBA is working with the Detroit Building Authority identify priorities for
non-HHF demolitions where City demolition funding is available.

In Q2 2019, intervention through the sale of homes for rehab and occupation, where possible,
outside HHF zones was a focus. The DLBA identified 109 houses located outside HHF zones
available for sale through its online home sales programs, primarily Own It Now. Of which, the
DLBA received offers or closed on 43 of these homes. By comparison, 44 houses outside HHF
zones were listed for sale 01 2019 and 36 in Q4 2018; reflecting a sizable increase in non-HHF

zone home sales.

AUCTION

The Auction program aims to identify the strongest markets, blocks, and properties most
likely to be of interest to buyers. Vacancy reduction in these areas strengthens the markets and
spreads to adjacent blocks and neighborhoods. DLBA inventory increases in value in those
adjacent blocks and neighborhoods, thereby making rehab more economically feasible.

Preparing an Auction property for sale can be quite expensive, costing on average about $2,500
per property and sometimes much more. In addition to cleaning out the property, DLBA inspectors
inspect and provide an estimated cost of repairs for bringing the property up to minimum building
codes using standard grade materials. The DLBA hosts open houses for public viewing to increase
sales exposure. Given these expenses, properties most likely recoup the preparation cost are
identified for the Auction pipeline, where opening bids start at $1,000.

Beginning C11 2019, Auction properties increased from three to four properties per day resulting
in the sale of approximately 330 additional Auction properties per year. Increased Auction sales
help stabilize Detroit neighborhoods through home renovations and occupancy, reducing vacancy
and decreasing overall DLBA inventory.

The DLBA has listed 2,612 unique propertiEs for sale through the Auction platform since its
inaugural sales date of May 5,2014. Currently the largest concentration of Auction inventory is in
Brightmoor, followed by the Grixdale Farms neighborhood. These are weaker market areas,
though there are pockets of strength in each of these neighborhoods. Through site visits and
market analysis, the Inventory identifies the strongest parts of neighborhoods to prepare houses
for sale in the near future.

Please note this graph shows current Auction inventory, not previously sold Auction
properties.



The Own-It-Now (OIN) program developed as a leaner, more cost-effective program designed to
move vacant DLBA houses to sale without incurring the more substantial Auction program costs.
Unlike Auction, OIN houses are not cleared of debris and there are no open houses (interested
buyers can schedule private viewings). houses are expedited to the sale pipeline quickly and
with much less expense. Since the program?s launch in February 2016, 3,355 OIN properties have

been made available for sale.

11 Page

 

lean process promotes strategic entry into softer markets on the margins of areas where the
Auction program is operating, and the private market is active. Allowing a foothold in emerging
markets and testing real estate markets in areas where sales success is less assured. Setting the
stage for future Auction sales and neighborhood stabilization, while providing residents with the
opportunity to buy and rehab homes outside private market presence.

Purchase requests from the public play a central role in determining which houses are listed for
OIN sales. Over 70% of OIN listings resulted from requests. Historically, an average of 22 OIN
properties listed for per week. The DLBA is ramping up OIN inventory preparations, with plans to
double the number of weekly listings by C13 2019. This will enable increased interested purchaser
response, while taking initial steps towards market stabilization across the city.

The Inventory team is currently ramping up the number of houses under preparation for Own-It?
Now sale, with plans to double the number of weekly listings by early 2019. Historically, the
Inventory team has listed an average 22 Own-It-Now properties per week. The Inventory team
aims to increase this number to approximately 50 by early 2019.

VACANT LAND
Using a data-driven approach, the DLBA determines eligibility and status forthe 66,342 vacant lots

in its inventory. The bulk of these lots are made available through the Side Lot Program and the
DLBA regularly reviews inquiries to determine if they can be listed through the Side Lot program.
Other parcels are identified for possible infill development opportunities, city-led projects, or are
reviewed for possible sale via property project applications such as community parks. Many lots
have tax or title issues preventing immediate sale

PROPERTY MAINTENANCE

In coordination with the City of Detroit, General Services Department (GSD), the DLBA addresses
inventory maintenance concerns. Board Up Brigade responds to vacant house board ups
across the city, including DLBA owned structures as well as regular premises lawn maintenance.
Concerns such as overgrown yards, illegal dumping, and hazardous trees at DLBA properties is
compiled via These requests originate with city agencies (City Council, Department of
Neighborhoods), as well as resident complaints made directly to the DLBA. While GSD works

through the backlog of maintenance concerns, the DLBA reviews and submits new requests daily.
Progress and benchmarks are communicated and tracked via Salesforce facilitating efficient
constituent communication regarding status updates and maintenance concerns.

PROJECT MANAGEMENT

The DLBA has worked closely with the Department of Neighborhood?s Bridging Neighborhoods
Program (BNP) since October 2017 to ?facilitate the transition of families from the Delray area in
Southwest to other Detroit neighborhoods.? The inventory Department helped identify
nearly 800 properties across 29 neighborhoods and Detroit?s districts that fit the program
specifications. As of January 2019, 16 properties were identified as ?Program Properties?, or
properties actively shown to Delray residents. Additionally, 16 DLBA properties are under contract
with residents participating in the Bridging Neighborhoods Program.

Clear, insurable title is critical for anyone buying property?notjust from the DLBA, but in general.
Clear title provides confidence to the property owner in their ownership and any investment they
make. It is an absolute prerequisite for any lending institution considering a mortgage. Indeed, so
important is clear title that it is one of the reasons the land banks were created by the state
legislature. In (12 2019 the Title Team received 919 new title orders. New title orders
include examination of the title commitment for ownership (vesting) and underwriter's
requirements to eliminate outstanding interests, including tax and utility status, that may prevent
future marketable title. Often, the steps required to resolve title encumbrances necessitate
coordinated efforts with DLBA's Quiet Title legal department.

In total, 1,649 properties were assessed in 0.2 2019, ofwhich 615 (Initial Review) were confirmed
to have marketable title with no delinquent taxes and graded as ready for sale; 727 (Legal Review)
were transferred to Quiet Title; and the remaining 307 (Update Reviews) reviewed to confirm
continued clear title with no new interested parties, new recorded/unrecorded liens, or tax bills
were assessed against the property, which would prevent it from moving forward in the sale
process.

DETROIT LAND BANK AUTHORITY

DEMOLITION DEPARTMENT


TAMMY DANIELS, DIRECTOR OF DEMOLITION

 

DLBA DEMOLITION PROGRAM

The Detroit Land Bank Authority (DLBA), in partnership with the Mayor's Office, City Council, and
the Detroit Building Authority (DBA), continues to impact all Council Districts through its various
demolition programs. In 2015, the demolition program made great strides towards blight
reduction in highly populated/high-density areas, radial thoroughfares and commercial corridors
throughout the City of Detroit. The DLBA gears its targeted demolitions within the designated
Hardest Hit Fund (HHF) geographic boundaries toward reducing blight and spurring economic
activity in these neighborhoods. The strategic demolition efforts are complemented by
strategic reinvestment and rehabilitation, leading to significant increases in property values across
the City.

HARDEST HIT FUNDS

Beginning in June 2018, Michigan State Housing Development Authority (MSHDA) started issuing
credits to the DLBA through its various HHF rounds. These credits represent a refund of settlement
proceeds as well as the return of the Fire Insurance Escrow dollars paid to MSHDA. The
total refund is currently $6,602,690.50 and will be used to demolish additional residential
structures. In June 2018 refund credits issued to the DLBA were as follows: 
HHF3- $638.25; effectively reopening HHF1 and HHF2 rounds. As ofthe date
of this report, four (4) rounds of HHF funding are currently open, as the DLBA successfully closed
out HHF3 on December 27,2018.

The initial funding from the Hardest Hit Fund (HHF1) provided $57,342,668.95 in demolition funds
and was closed in the Third Quarter 2015, with a mere $700.00 remaining balance, transferred to
the next round. To date, the DLBA had utilized these funds to demolish 3,686 residential
structures. As noted above, HHF1 received an additional $5,409,638.69 in new funding allowing
the demolition of approximately 315 additional residential structures. The DLBA identified
properties within the geographic boundaries of HHF1 to expend these funds. Currently, those
designated properties are contracted for demolition or undergoing environmental due diligence
surveys. As of December 31, 2018, the DLBA received $57,410,430.30 in disbursements by
$5,341,877.34 remains. The DLBA has until December 31, 2019, to either expend all the
remaining allocated dollars or request a transfer of any unspent dollars to other rounds.

The second round of Hardest Hit Funds (HHF2) provided $50,000,719.05 in demolition funds. Early
in the Fourth Quarter 2017, the demolition team reduced the grant funds remaining under
this round to $5,410.94, effectively closing out HHF2. As of the date of this report, the DLBA has
demolished and received reimbursement for the demolition of 2,941 residential structures. As
noted above, HHF2 received an additional $1,192,413.56 in funding for the demolition of
approximately 70 additional residential structures. As of December 31, 2018, the DLBA received

$50, 176,307.09 in disbursements by $1,016,825.52 remaining. The DLBA identified
properties within the geographic boundaries of HHF2 to expend these funds; these properties are
currently contracted for demolition or undergoing environmental due diligence surveys. The DLBA
has until December 31, 2019, to either expend all the allocated dollars or request any unspent
dollars are transferred to other rounds.

The third round of Hardest Hit Funds (HHF3) provided $21,255,000.00 in demolition funds. As of
December 31, 2018, the DLBA has been reimbursed $21,249,169.99; leaving $6,468.26 and
effectively closing out this round of funding. As ofthe date ofthis report, the DLBA has demolished
and received reimbursement for the demolition of 1,465 residential structures across the seven
Council Districts.

The fourth round of Hardest Hit Funds (HHF4) provided $41,901,646.00 in demolition funds. As of
December 31, 2018, the DLBA has been reimbursed $35,636,919 from leaving
$6,264,726.86 to be drawn down by the DLBA, which is inclusive of the $2,108,219.03, for which
the DLBA is currently seeking reimbursement. To date, 2,035 structures have been demolished
and reimbursed by MSHDA. This fourth round of funding allows for the demolition of
approximately 2,400 residential structures, and HH4 is expected to be closed out on or before
June 30,2019.

The fifth round of Hardest Hit Funds (HHF5) provides for $88,153,425.00 in demolition funds. As
of December 31, 2018, the DLBA has been reimbursed $8,860,797.93; leaving $79,292,627.07 in
grant funds to be drawn down by the DLBA, which is inclusive ofthe $7,581,284.75, for which the
DLBA is currently seeking reimbursement. The DLBA expects to demolish approximately 5,200
residential structures under this final round of funding by Friday

PROCUREMENT 

in April 2018, to stabilize demolition costs and provide a greater level of predictability with the
release of HHF program Request for Proposals the DLBA began issuing between 400-450
properties per month for demolition RFP. Given the increased volume and timing of RFP releases,
the DLBA elected to issue an RFP for Procurement Administrative Services to transition the HHF
procurement process to a third-party company skilled at providing such services on the scale and
scope envisioned by the DLBA. The DLBA noted the Detroit Building Authority (DBA), its demolition
project manager, was spending an increasing amount oftime, resources, and staff on procurement
related issues, limiting ability to focus on field operations. Also driving the decision
to transition the procurement process to a third party was the recognition that an anticipated
spike in demo RFP releases and increased supervision mandated by March 6,2018, Department
of Health protocols could negatively impact the DBA's ability to manage field operations
effectively. Effective July 1, 2018, with a goal of providing increased stability, transparency, and to
encourage the participation of a diverse group of contractors; the DLBA transitioned its HHF
procurement services from the DBA to Price, Waterhouse, Coopers, Public Sector, LLP 

35 Page

 

PWC was selected based on their response to the they bring a wealth of knowledge,
experience, and a stellar reputation to the DLBA and the Hardest Hit Fund Demolition Program. A
formal agreement was executed on June 30, 2018, and the transition process began in earnest.
Working in close conjunction with the DBA, PWC is currently contracted to provide project
management, process mapping (which includes streamlining the current process), review,
tabulation and recommendations of approximately 10 RFP groups per month. PWC will also be
responsible for administering-the annual RFO. process.

Since completion of the transition in late July 2018, the DLBA has seen a sharp increase in
efficiency; with the time to review, tabulate, and award RFP's down from six-to-eight weeks tojust
two weeks. The DLBA successfully eliminated the RFP backlog during this quarter; and will
complete the HHF procurement process on or before March 30, 2019. Other process
improvements implemented under the partnership with PWC include, but are not limited to,
virtual bid openings, recorded bid openings, streamlined documentation, increased programmatic
transparency.

POLICY 

in February 2018, the DLBA transitioned to an RFQ process, to mitigate the arduous submission
process. The new RFQ process allows demolition contractors to become pre-qualified to
participate in the HHF program by submitting a complete qualification package once a year,
instead of submitting qualification documents with every RFP as previously required. Since the
implementation of the RFQ process, the program maintains a current list of thirteen (13) pre-
qualified demolition contractors; ofwhich three (3) are On October 29, 2018, the DLBA
released the 2019 calendar year RFQ and is currently reviewing submissions.

The DLBA continues to work diligently with the demolition contractors to ensure their invoices and
supporting documents are correct, complete, and processed in a timely manner. As a result ofthe
restructuring of the demolition department along with the numerous process improvements that
were implemented in late 2017, the demolition department was able to significantly increase it
productivity. As reflected in the chart below, payments to demolition contractors increased by
58% with the number of properties processed increasing by 115%.

DEMOLITION ADVANCE FUND

On March 31, 2015, through the approval of City Council, the $20m Demolition Advance Fund
was created. The sole purpose of the DAF was to ensure the DLBA had sufficient cash flow
to make payments to contractors providing services under the HHF program, while the DLBA
awaits reimbursement payments from MSHDA. The DLBA in partnership with the Office ofthe CFO
has been working to amend the Memorandum of Understanding with the City to ensure
conformity with the City Council's Resolution that created the DAF. The amended agreement will
be presented to City Council upon completion

NON-HHF MSHDA GRANT
In August 2017, in partnership with the Detroit Building Authority (DBA), the DLBA was awarded a

$458,000.00 non-HHF grant from MSHDA for the demolition of blighted residential structures
within the City of Detroit. As a pre?condition of the award, the City of Detroit was required to
match the MSHDA grant funds; therefore $916,000.00 will be used to demolish 60 additional
blighted properties. The DBA serves as the administrator and project manager for this project. The
60 properties selected, in large part, fall outside of the traditional HHF boundaries. The
environmental due diligence work was completed on the subject properties on or about
September 25, 2017. The City of Detroit issued the 4.5.2018 Abatement and Demolition 
DMC, the lowest bidder, was awarded the contracts. The City of Detroit is currently working with

37 Page

 

DMC to complete the abatement and demolition of the 60 structures by the current deadline of
February 28, 2019.

As a result ofthe efforts, working in conjunction with MSH DA and its City partners, we have
demolished more than 10,600 blighted structures with the HHF funding. The DLBA estimates that
we will demolish an additional 4,000 structures with the remaining HHF funding. The removal of
these blighted structures from the City?s landscape has assisted in stabilizing neighborhoods and
motivating the real estate market, both of which are crucial to the City?s resurgence.

DETROIT LAND BANK AUTHORITY

LEGAL DEPARTMENT

MIKE BRADY, GENERAL COUNSEL

 

The Detroit Land Bank Authority (DLBA) Legal Department provides legal counsel and assistance
to the Board of Directors, the Executive Director, and the organization?s staff for all programs 
disposition, acquisition, and demolition). Additionally, the Legal Department staffs various DLBA
programs, including Quiet Title, Compliance, and the Nuisance Abatement Program that either
directly supports or supplements all other DLBA activities. As described below, Disposition would
not be able to sell properties with title issues if it were not for Legal?s quiet title lawsuits. Nuisance
Abatement works alongside all other DLBA tools sales, demolition, etc.) to stabilize
neighborhoods. Legal?s Compliance enforcement efforts ensure that the City and Citizens of
Detroit get what has been promised not just properties sold, but properties returned to
productive use.

QUIET TITLE

The Legal Department files and oversees expedited Quiet Title Actions pursuant to authority under
Section 9 of the Land Bank Fast Track Act, MCL 124.759. On September 2, 2014 the Chiefludge
of the Wayne County Circuit Court issued a special docket directive creating a special docket
allowing the Detroit Land Bank Authority to file these actions in an efficient manner. Quiet title
actions are filed on properties acquired by the DLBA enabling the DLBA to dispose of those
properties with clear insurable title. Clear insurable title is very important for anyone buying
property?not just from the DLBA, but in general. Clear title provides confidence to the property
owner in their ownership and any investment they make. It is an absolute pre-requirement for any
lending institution considering a mortgage. Indeed, so important is clear title that it is one of the
reasons land banks were created by the state legislature. As of December 31, 2018, this last
quarter, the Legal Department received seven hundred and five (705) quiet title judgments.

NUISANCE ABATEMENT ABANDONED PROPERTIES

The Nuisance Abatement Program (NAP) within the Detroit Land Bank Authority (DLBA) was
established in February 2014. The Detroit City Council delegated non-exclusive authority to
commence Nuisance Abatement litigation on February 18, 2014 (Council Action Number 23).
Properties meeting the NAP criteria are: vacant and unoccupied, boarded, open to trespass,
appear to be abandoned or neglected. The NAP property addresses are initially identified through
governmental data, and then verified by investigators, community groups, or neighbors in
targeted geographic areas. The NAP Target Areas were defined by the City of Detroit Department
of Neighborhoods with input from members of the community. Specific boundaries were
determined with the use of data sources to specify areas where NAP actions would be most
effective?areas with relatively low levels of vacancy where a NAP lawsuit (or three) could really
make the difference on an otherwise stable block.

Service of Process is made on all current owners. A search of tax and title records is conducted
for each property to determine all current interest holders of record; including owners, mortgage
companies, and any other liens. All current owners of record are named in the NAP civil lawsuit,
which requests the 'nuisance? created by the condition be abated. Owners or interest holders in

39 Page

 

properties who fail to respond to the lawsuit may lose their ownership rights to the property at a
hearing for defaultjudgment.

This last quarter, as of December 31, 2018, the Legal Department identified, placed notices
(?posters?) on one hundred and eighty?eight properties (188) and filed suit against one hundred
and thirteen (113) properties in twenty-nine (29) different neighborhoods throughout the City.
These actions resulted in agreements to address the blight or in judgments awarding ownership
ofthe properties to the DLBA facilitating blight resolution through the various programs.
This last quarter, there were eighty?one (81) agreements with property owners to rehabilitate
their properties. As of December 31, 2018, the NAP program received fifty?two (52) default
judgments, five (5) donations of abandoned property to the DLBA in lieu of litigation, and one
hundred and thirty-eight (138) properties purchased from defendant property owners in cost-
saving settlements.

NAP lawsuits are an important tool in fulfilling the mission of stabilizing neighborhoods by
addressing blighted and abandoned property.

COMPLIANCE

The Compliance Team enforces agreements signed by property owners who have either
purchased a property from the DLBA ("Sales Compliance"), or whose property was the subject of
a nuisance abatement action Compliance"). For both Sales and NAP Compliance, property
owners agree to rehabilitate the property within six (6) months and provide regular updates to the
Compliance Team documenting and verifying progress. If a property owner is not able to achieve
compliance within the initial timeframe, but has shown acceptable ?proof of progress,? the
Compliance Team provides 90-day extensions. If the property is located within a local historic
district, or the property was purchased during the winter months, an automatic 90-day extension

is provided.

The Sales Compliance reporting period begins on the date of closing, when the property owner
takes title to the property and obtains possession. At closing, the property owner simultaneously
executes a Reconveyance Deed the DLBA can record if the property owner fails to rehabilitate the
property and meet the obligations outlined in the purchase agreement. Achieving Sales
Compliance involves an objective three-part criteria including 1) obtaining the appropriate
inspection from the City of Detroit?s Building Safety Engineering Environmental Department
(BSEED), 2) occupying the property, 3) exterior maintained no boards, no blight.

The NAP Compliance program works with property owners who have entered into an agreement
to avoid or stop litigation on properties identified as vacant, blighted, and a nuisance. The
agreement outlines their responsibilities for rehabilitating or demolishing the property or selling
it to someone who will. If the property owner fails to provide ?proof of progress? on the subject
property, the Compliance Team transfers the matter to DLBA attorneys for court action. NAP

40 Page

 

Compliance is achieved by showing the property is no longer a nuisance to the residents and the
neighborhoods evidenced by occupancy and exterior maintenance no boards, no blight. Once
NAP Compliance IS achieved, the DLBA releases its lis pendens and dismisses the lawsuit.

DATA SOLUTIONS

Data collection, organization, and analysis is critical to the functionality and forward growth of the
Detroit Land Bank Authority?s Inventory, Disposition, Demolition, and Legal departments. The
Salesforce systemis the most comprehensive property database in the City of Detroit and
the backbone ofthe DLBA. Since launching in Q1 2015, its user base, both internally and externally,
has constantly increased. As City agencies discovered its comprehensive nature, the DLBA receives
frequent requests to add users from departments with diverse missions; from the Detroit Police
Department to the General Services Department. The DLBA provides access and support at no cost
to City agencies.

150The Demolition Department?s administration of the Hardest Hit Fund (HHF) program
requires a large quantity of documents exchange and verification between demolition contractors
and DLBA staff. To streamline this process, the Data Solutions team built a sophisticated document
management system into Salesforce allowing contractors to directly upload their documents and
invoices directly without overwrite or deletion capabilities. DLBA staff can then review, verify, and
directly request updates from Salesforce. Both contractors and DLBA staff report this system is
streamlining their processes, reducing error, and increasing throughput.

The Salesforce platform is ?cloud-based? this enables Data Solutions to support a variety of
field operations including Sidelots fairs, Closing fairs, and a variety of surveying methods. In Q2
2019 the Data Solutions team built a mobile-based module for the Detroit Health Department
(DH D) to survey occupants of DLBA?owned structures. This assessment helps ensure residents are
directed to appropriate wrap around programs, through both the DLBA and DH D. Additionally, any
DLBA representative can answer questions about specific properties by accessing data on their
mobile devices when they encounter residents at neighborhood events, such as Block Club
meetings. Expanded Salesforce access supports and enhances functionality across the DLBA.

June 30, 2018 and 2017

 

This section of the annual report of the Detroit Land Bank Authority (the presents
management?s discussion and analysis of the ?nancial performance during the ?scal
years that ended on June 30. 2018 and 2017'. Please read it in conjunction 1with the 
?nancial statements- which follow this section

FEASICLEI. 

The purpose is to exercise the powers, duties, functions, and responsibilities of an
authority under the Land Bank Act for the bene?ts of the City of Detroit (the "City?j and the
State of Michigan. The DLBA endeavors to carry out the powers duties, functions, and
responsibilities of an authority under the Land Bank Act consistent with the inter-governmental
agreement including. but not limited to. the power. ptitilege. and authority to acquire. manage.
and dispose of utterests in property. and performing all other finiteness necessary or convenient
to implement the purposes. objecnses. and provisions of the Land Bani: Act and the proposes.
objectives. and powers delegated to a City authority under the laws or executive orders-

The demolition activities funded by the Hardest Hit Blight pro-gram for the ?scal year
ended June 30. ?2018 totaled 1,638 properties. compared to 1,889 in the previous ?scal year. The
inventory of property decreased to 95-2-12 parcels, compared to 97,185 as of the end of
the previous ?scal year.

0? Of 1131 STATEMENTS

This annual report contains two types of ?nancial statements. The statements of net position and
statements of activities [uhich are presented on pages 10 and 11) are considered govermnent?
wide ?namjal statements. The balance sheets and statements of revenue. expendinues. and
changes in ?nd balances for governmental funds (which are presented on pages 12, 13. 15. and
16) are considered ?md ?nancial statements. A further discussion of each type of statement
follows-

financial Statements

The government-wide ?nancial statements report infonnation about the DLBA as a ?hole
using accounting methods similar to those used by private-sector companies and non-pro?t
organizations. The statements of net position include all of the DLBA's assets. deferred
outflows of resources- liabilities. and deferred in?ows of resources. All of the current year's
revenue and expenses are accounted for in the statements of activities. regardless of when
cash is received or paid-

June 30, 2018 and 201?

 

01' THE 51-111}st tC 

Government-Wide financial Statements tcontinue?

"the two government-wide ?nancial statements report the net position and hon: they
have changed. Net position represents the difference between the DLBA's total of assets and
deferred outflows of resources and its total of liabilities and deferred in?ows of resources.
and it represents one way to measure the. ?nancial health. or position. Over time,
increases or decreases in the net position are an indicator of whether its ?nancial
health is improving or deteriorating.

1' and ?nancial Statements

The fund ?nancial statements provide more detailed information about the ?uids,
not the DLBA as a whole. Funds are accounting devices that the DLBA uses to keep track of
speci?c sources of ?mdnig and spending for particular ptuposes.

Most of the activities are included in governmental ?nds. which focus on how cash,
and other ?nancial assets that can be readin converted to cash, ?ow in and out, and show the
balances left at the end of the year that are available for spending. As such, the hand
financial statements provide a detailed short-term view that shows whether there are more or
fewer ?nancial resources that can be spent in the near future to ?nance the 
programs. Because this information does not encompass the additional long-term focus of
the government-wide ?nancial statements, additional information is provided on pages 14
and 17 that explains the relationship bemreen the fund ?nancial statements and the
govermient-wide ?nancial statements.

The notes to the ?nancial statements. which begin on page 18. explain some of the information
in the ?nancial statements and provide more detailed data. A comparison of the DLBA's general
fund revenue and expendimres to its budget is provided onpages 30 and 31.

Total room for the year ended June 30, 21018 on the accrual basis increased to $67.5 million
?om $67.0 million in the previous year, primarily due to recognition of the forgiveness of debt
by the City of Detroit in the amount of $6.5 million

Total expenses for the year ended June 30, 2018 on the accrual basis decreased to $57.3 million
from $64.1 million in the previous year, primarily due to decreased demolition activities.

CAPITAL ASSETS

As of June 30. 2013, the DLBA has 8616.332 invested in capital assets including furniture,
computers, so?ware. and other equipment. Acctunulated depreciation as of June 30. 2018 was
3516.684.



The DLBA is dedicated to returning Detroit?s vacant. abandoned and foreclosed property to
productive use. To meet this mission. there are four main divisions of the DLBA:

I Inventory division. which is responsible for acqu'ning. evaluating. and assessing the
disposition of the property

0 Demolition division which manages all demolition activities

0 Disposition division which is responsible for disposing of the property through sales or
donations

- Legal division. 1aliich is responsible for clearing title and enforcing compliance with the
City?s Housing Regr?ations and representing the DLBA for all legal matters

The DLBA is demolishing and removing derelict structures= holding and maintaining property.
and disposing of the property in conjunction with a development project or other appropriate use.
Most. transactions that remove a property from the inventory generate revenue for the
organization Examples of these transactions include. but are not limited to, property sales, side

lot sales, and special purpose projects.

As the opportunity arises. the DLBA will also execute federal. state, and local grants that have a
public land component. ?Hie DLBA played a key role in implementing several rounds of the
federally funded Neighborhood Stabilization Program in with the City and
the Michigan State Housing Development Authority

DISCITSSION AND ANALYSIS 

June 30, 2018 and 2017

 

   

AC TORS NTDITED

In the coming years. the DLBA will continue to focus on activities through contracts with
MST-113A. The DLBA will also continue to build relationships with the philanthropic
conmutnitv, seeking to attract foundation grant support to leverage public funds.

HHF In partnership with the Michigan Land Bank Authority. the DLBA received $52.3
million during the year aided J1me 30. 2014 and based on its ef?cient implementation. the
DLBA received an additional $5 million of HHF monies to demolish approximately 500
additional properties. During the year ended June 30. 2015, the DLBA was warded another
$50 million to increase demolition of additional blighted structures. The DLBA was awarded
an additional $63.1 million during the year ended June 30. 2016. During the ?scal year
ended June 30. 2017. MSHDA awarded $88.1 million plus an additional $5 million

NSP Closeout The DLBA fully expended all 1 and 2 grant funds in previous
fiscal years, and 3 grant funds were fully expended in the current ?scal year. The
DI..BA will continue to participate in closeout activities related to these properties. as needed.

Public and Private Partnerships The DLBA has formed partnerships with local
organizations to implement a program providing newly rehabilitated homes in targeted
neighborhoods of Detroit. The DLBA received grants of 31.3 million supported by a loan of
$2 million to rehabilitate the housmg and alleviate blight in the surrounding neighborhoods.
The DLBA will also receive a loan loss reserve to ?ll any shortfalls in sales price versus
rehabilitation costs. The outside organizations will rehabilitate the identi?ed properties.

Under Michigan law. the DLBA will receive 50 percent of the speci?c tax generated on all
properties that are. sold bythe DLBA for ?ve years succeeding the transfer of the property to
private owners. The speci?c taxis equal to the ad valorem taxes that would be generated if
the property were not exanpt ?om ad valorem taxation. These ?tnds will be received by the
DLBA in the same manner and the same time that the City distributes current tax collections
to all taxing jurisdictions for which it collects property taxes. The DLBA budget ?rst
realized this revenue some 201:3.

The BLBA will continue to market its ability to act as a City?wide development tool in areas
that are deemed marketable, as well as to increase visibility to support commercial
development investments and develop fee-based services. such as title cleansing. The
long-term strategy is to act as a resource in the City's neighborhood revitalization
efforts, aligning its efforts with the City speci?cally on management of public land
extending relationships with and parole-ring with conhnruiiw groups to improve
Detroit neighborhoods-

Fair Value Measurements {c on?nuedl
The various levels of the fair value hierarchy are described as follows:

0 Level 1 Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on unadjusted quoted
market prices for identical assets and liabilities in an active market that the DLBA has the
abilityr to access

0 Level 2 Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on quoted prices in markets
that are not active or model inputs that are observable for substan?allv the full term of the
asset or liability

0 Level 3 Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on prices or valuan?on
techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and signi?cant to the overall fair
value measurement

The use of observable market data, when available, is required in making fair value
measmements. TMien inputs used to measure fair value fall tvidini different levels of the
hierarchy- the level Within which the fair value measurement as categorized is based on the.

which collectively comprise foe basic financial statements. and have issued our report
diereon dated October 25. 2018.

Internal anti-pl orer 17E angle! Reporrhi 

In planning and perfomn'ng our audit of the ?nancial statements. we considered the DEL-K's
internal control over ?nancial reporting I?inrernal control") to determine the main procetim?es
Lint are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing our opinions on the
?nancial statements. but not for the pin-pose of expressing an opinion on the e??ecns'eness of the
DEE-.535 internal control. Accordingly. we do not ezqness an opinion on the effecnreness of the
internal control.

A de?ciency. in internal cairn-oi exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow
management or employees. in the normal course of performing their assigned functions. to
present. or detect and correct. misstatements on a timely basis. A material ?calmer: is a
de?ciency. or a combination of de?ciencies- in mternai control such that there is a reasonable
possibility that a material misstatement of the ?nmicial statements Will not be
prevented. or detected and corrected. on a timely basis. A rigiri?cmrr dq?ct?enn is a de?ciency.
or a combination of de?ciencies. in internal control that is less severe than a material wealmess.
yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance.

Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the ?rst paragraph
of this section and was not tiesrgned to identify all de?ciencies tn intemal control that might be
material wealmesses or Signi?cant de?ciencies. Given these limitations. during our audit. we did
not idenn?' any de?ciencies in internal control that we consider to be material weaknesses
However. material wealmesses may: exist that have not been identi?ett

EMORANDUM

TO: David Whitaker, Director, Legislative Policy Division

Council Member James Tate, Chair, Flaming and Economic Development
FROM: Council President Pro Tern Mary Shef?eld (ii/i

DATE: January 15, 2019 

RE: Request for LPD to Draft an Amendment to the Proposed 51% Local Hiring

Ordinance to Require Section 3 Certi?cation on City-funded Construction Projects

 

I am requesting that LPD amend the proposed 51% Local Hiring ordinance to require
Contractors to be H.U.D. Section 3 certi?ed through the City of Detroit for publically funded
construction projects. The measure will further ensure that public funds will help address some
of our City?s and Region?s most pressing issues related to poverty and unemployment.

Furthermore, I am requesting that LPD provide a report on the City of Detroit?s ability to
implement an ordinance requiring Section 3 compliance and certi?cation for other non-
construction related City-funded contracts such as garbage collection and other jobs with
minimal skills or training required.

Thank you.

Cc: Honorable Colleagues
Honorable City Clerk
Stephanie Washington, Liaison, Mayor?s Of?ce
