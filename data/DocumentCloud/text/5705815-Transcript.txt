·1· · · · CHAIRMAN MOONEY:· I'll convene the meeting.

21· · · · MR. DESAI:· Kant Desai.
22· · · · ALDERMAN AUSTIN:· Good morning.
23· · · · CHAIRMAN MOONEY:· Alderman Austin.· All
24· right.· Good.· Now we have a quorum.· Let us

·1· status of previously approved projects.
·2· · · · · · · · ·So here's our kind of breakdown of
·3· projects that CDF has closed on to date, including
·4· the 2013 activity here.
·5· · · · · · · · ·So four projects closed in 2013,
·6· so about a typical year of activity for CDF.
·7· · · · · · · · ·Just a recap of the most recent
·8· activity.· The 2013 deals, Shops and Lofts @ 47
·9· closed back in February.· That was CDF's first
10· grocery deal mixed use project at 47th and Cottage
11· Grove, with mixed income housing upstairs.
12· · · · · · · · ·The ACE, or Affordable Community
13· Energy project -14· · · · CHAIRMAN MOONEY:· I should say that that
15· project is well under construction at this point.
16· · · · MR. SMITH:· Good point, yes.· And I think
17· it's supposed to open the third quarter of next
18· year.
19· · · · · · · · ·Affordable Community Energy, or ACE,
20· is a series of retrofits of existing aging rental
21· housing buildings, all of them affordable, and all
22· of them within Hispanic Development Corporation's
23· portfolio.
24· · · · · · · · ·So this project is -- it closed in

Page 3

Page 5

·1· proceed.
·2· · · · · · · · ·This should be a relatively short
·3· meeting.· Two items on the agenda.
·4· · · · · · · · ·One is an update on where
·5· projects are, and then we do have one project for
·6· consideration.
·7· · · · · · · · ·So, Tony, I'll turn it over to you.
·8· · · · MR. SMITH:· Do you want to do the minutes
·9· approval from the last meeting first?
10· · · · CHAIRMAN MOONEY:· Oh, yes.· We have had an
11· opportunity to take a look at the minutes of the
12· September 5th meeting.
13· · · · · · · · ·Is there a motion to approve?
14· · · · ALDERMAN AUSTIN:· So moved.
15· · · · CHAIRMAN MOONEY:· Second?
16· · · · MS. SCOTT:· Second.
17· · · · CHAIRMAN MOONEY:· It's been moved and
18· seconded.
19· · · · · · · · ·All in favor, say aye.
20· · · · · · · · · · · (Chorus of ayes.)
21· · · · · · · · ·Thank you.
22· · · · · · · · ·Now Tony, please.· Status.
23· · · · MR. SMITH:· Sure.· So just a quick status
24· update on activities since the last meeting and the

·1· September and construction is under way.· They have
·2· about five of the eleven properties retrofitted so
·3· far.
·4· · · · · · · · ·And, actually, this project was
·5· mentioned by Shaun Donovan at the Greenbuild
·6· conference as a specific innovation in affordable
·7· housing, and he commended ACE for getting the deal
·8· closed with New Markets Tax Credit financing.· So a
·9· good plug there.
10· · · · · · · · ·And then Near North Health Service
11· Corporation's new clinic at North and Kostner,
12· which closed also in September.
13· · · · · · · · ·And then the most recent closing,
14· Breakthrough Urban Ministries Family-Plex and
15· Joshua Center Rehab.· So two buildings; one new
16· construction, one rehab, in the East Garfield Park
17· neighborhood.· Financing closed in November and
18· construction has begun.· So they did manage to get
19· dirt moving before too much of a frost set in on
20· the ground.· So hopefully construction will be on
21· schedule.
22· · · · · · · · ·So this is a breakdown in terms of
23· construction status.· All but four of the projects
24· are substantially complete and operational.

·1· · · · · · · · ·So Chicago Family Health Center had
·2· a ribbon cutting on October 1st in conjunction with
·3· the open enrollment date for the Affordable Care
·4· Act.
·5· · · · · · · · ·Near North Health Service
·6· Corporation had an event in November.
·7· · · · · · · · ·And still under construction are the
·8· Leslie Shankman Hyde Park Day project at 63rd and
·9· Ingleside.· That's supposed to open late first
10· quarter of 2014.
11· · · · · · · · ·Shops and Lofts, at least the
12· grocery component, third quarter of 2014.
13· · · · · · · · ·ACE Solar I believe is going to be
14· second quarter of 2014, when they're substantially
15· complete with their building retrofits.
16· · · · · · · · ·And then Breakthrough Urban
17· Ministries is just beginning construction, with
18· roughly a year to go as far as further construction
19· activity.
20· · · · · · · · ·In terms of job creation for these
21· projects, so we tracked the initial projection from
22· the borrower, and then real time projections each
23· year as they complete the facility and occupy it.
24· · · · · · · · ·So what you're seeing here, the blue

·1· September 17th, a day ahead of the deadline.· The
·2· anticipated award timing is still in flux, the CDFI
·3· fund is being somewhat cagey, but the rumors keep
·4· coming out and keep focusing on sort of the May
·5· time frame, although recently I heard June also
·6· mentioned, so -·7· · · · MS. KOTAK:· One quick P.S. on that.· We've
·8· been working closely with the City's D.C. office to
·9· make sure that they're aware of all the closings
10· and the events coming up.
11· · · · · · · · ·We're trying to engage with folks
12· from Treasury to get them out for a site visit,
13· that as they're looking at the application or
14· they've got other folks looking at the application,
15· that they're reminded of sort of what we do and
16· seeing it on the ground.
17· · · · · · · · ·D.C. has been leading that effort.
18· It was a little bit changed by the fact that the
19· CDFI lead is retiring.· So Donna Gambrell is
20· actually retiring, and they haven't I think yet
21· picked her replacement.· So they're very much on
22· top of the lobbying effort and that, so we've been
23· coordinating very closely with them.
24· · · · · · · · ·The other P.S. that I'd add is that

Page 7

Page 9

·1· columns, are actual job creation reported as of
·2· year end 2012.· The red are the projected full
·3· stabilized job creation for that particular
·4· borrower.
·5· · · · · · · · ·So you see here that many of CDF's
·6· older deals have reached stabilization or close to
·7· it.· A couple of them have a few more jobs that
·8· they think they'll create as they reach the full
·9· scale operations in the facility.· And then the
10· newer deals that closed too late to have a complete
11· open facility by year end 2012 are off to the right
12· here, and so we'll be measuring those actual job
13· impacts for the facilities that are open early in
14· calendar year 2014.
15· · · · · · · · ·So as far as activity since the last
16· board meeting, financing closed for three of the
17· projects I just mentioned.· That was ACE Solar
18· on September 10th, Near North Health Service
19· Corporation on September 12th, and Breakthrough
20· Urban Ministries, there was a qualified equity
21· investment on September 13th, and then a full
22· closing deployment of that equity on November 13th.
23· · · · · · · · ·CDF also submitted its New Markets
24· allocation application to the CDFI fund on

·1· we -- as part of the application, one of the things
·2· we highlighted, and you've seen it in the closings
·3· that are referenced, was the leverage that we
·4· engage in between CDF and city resources.
·5· · · · · · · · ·So Breakthrough Urban Ministries and
·6· Shops and Lofts are both examples in which there
·7· weren't only New Market Tax Credits, but there were
·8· also TIF, and I think on Shops and Lofts -- were
·9· there also tax credits on that?
10· · · · MS. SANCHEZ:· Yes.
11· · · · MS. KOTAK:· So we've engaged in a number of
12· the bureaus within the department.
13· · · · MR. SMITH:· Great points.· Thank you.
14· · · · · · · · ·This will be a very competitive
15· application round.· 310 total applications
16· submitted.· We don't yet know how many awards, but
17· probably something in the 80 to 90 range would be
18· typical.· So that places it at the -- among the
19· most competitive rounds in the history of the
20· program.
21· · · · · · · · ·As part of CDF's strategy to be
22· maximally competitive for this round, CDF did do a
23· prefunding of $5 million of New Markets allocation
24· on September 17th, so almost exhausting its current

·1· stock of tax credits, as part of an effort to
·2· demonstrate to Treasury that we're out, we need
·3· more to continue the great things that CDF's been
·4· doing.
·5· · · · · · · · ·This chart shows the deployment flow
·6· of the allocation.· So to date -- I'm sorry.· So to
·7· date, $232 million of allocation has been deployed,
·8· including that $5 million prefunding.· $6 million
·9· is unclosed as of today.
10· · · · · · · · ·And that's it as far as the status
11· update.
12· · · · CHAIRMAN MOONEY:· Thank you.
13· · · · · · · · ·Any questions?
14· · · · · · · · · · · (No response.)
15· · · · · · · · ·Alderman, any questions?
16· · · · ALDERMAN AUSTIN:· No.
17· · · · CHAIRMAN MOONEY:· Then we do have one item
18· for consideration on transactions.
19· · · · · · · · ·Tony.
20· · · · MR. SMITH:· So this would be the proposed use
21· of that $5 million prefunding with JPMorgan Chase,
22· and that is the METROsquash Academic and Squash
23· Center, which would be a new construction community
24· facility located at the southwest corner of 61st

·1· on that Choice Neighborhoods grant, and there are
·2· a number of partner organizations around the
·3· neighborhood, including the Woodlawn Children's
·4· Promise Community, the Woodlawn Public Safety
·5· Alliance, and others.
·6· · · · · · · · ·But basically this is a
·7· transformation of a very troubled large Section 8
·8· housing development called Grove Park, replacing
·9· it with mixed income and more contemporary design
10· facilities, housing, and then also a complementary
11· mix of commercial and community facilities.
12· · · · · · · · ·And so this is part of POAH's plan,
13· basically, to have organizations like METROsquash
14· integrated into that fabric.
15· · · · · · · · ·And so POAH is strongly encouraging
16· this to happen.· They're actually ground leasing
17· the site for METROsquash for a dollar with a 9918· year term.
19· · · · · · · · ·Here's where it's located, the
20· southwest corner of 61st and Cottage Grove.· And
21· this area here along Cottage Grove is kind of the
22· extent of the POAH efforts.· Here you see some of
23· the existing Grove Park housing units still here,
24· and then some of the newer redeveloped units down

Page 11

Page 13

·1· and Cottage Grove in the Woodlawn community area.
·2· · · · · · · · ·So METROsquash is a not-for-profit
·3· organization that was established in 2005.· Its
·4· mission is to enhance college readiness and college
·5· access for disadvantaged students in Chicago, and
·6· they do so with kind of a unique twist that
·7· incorporates athletics and academics.
·8· · · · · · · · ·So this would be a new 19,300 square
·9· foot facility that would have squash courts as well
10· as classrooms and METROsquash's administrative
11· space.· So their whole function would be moved off
12· of the U of C campus, where they currently occupy
13· inadequate older space on a rented basis, and this
14· would be an owned facility that would be their
15· permanent home.
16· · · · · · · · ·Projected closing time frame, it's
17· actually fairly ready to go in terms of -18· · · · CHAIRMAN MOONEY:· Tony, excuse me.· We should
19· mention that it's part of a larger development.
20· · · · MR. SMITH:· Yes, definitely.· It's part of
21· the Choice Neighborhoods Initiative grant funded
22· effort in Woodlawn.· That's POAH, Preservation of
23· Affordable Housing, Inc. is the lead nonprofit.
24· The City has been heavily collaborating with POAH

·1· here closer to the 63rd and Cottage Green Line
·2· station.
·3· · · · · · · · ·I should also mention over here,
·4· at 63rd and Ingleside, is the site of the Leslie
·5· Shankman Orthogenic School.· So this would be CDF's
·6· second transaction in Woodlawn, really starting to
·7· enhance the redevelopment efforts in this area.
·8· As you can see, there's a ton of vacancy along
·9· 63rd Street and scattered among the neighborhoods
10· here, and so this is really trying to catalyze
11· something holistic here in Woodlawn.
12· · · · MS. SCOTT:· What's the structure for
13· repayment?
14· · · · MR. SMITH:· So this would be a very
15· sustainable financing structure for METROsquash.
16· They've done a lot of capital campaign work so far.
17· And so the only kind of true what I call economic
18· debt in the structure would be a potentially bridge
19· loan from BMO Harris Bank for pledges that they
20· have in hand that haven't funded yet.· So I would
21· say no kind of true term debt for METROsquash.
22· · · · · · · · ·Our loans, CDF loans would be
23· provided technically as term loans, but they're
24· formatted to have a nominal interest rate and to be

 · Deposition of· ·MEETING, 12/19/2013

Page 16

·1· forgiven at the end of year 7.· So it's at a true
·2· debt load that METROsquash would have ongoing.
·3· · · · MS. SCOTT:· Have we done a transaction that
·4· way?
·5· · · · MR. SMITH:· Yeah, we've done a couple -·6· · · · MS. SCOTT:· With the expectation of debt
·7· would be forgiven?
·8· · · · MR. SMITH:· Yeah, that's CDF's standard
·9· format.· It's sort of a gap financing tool that's
10· formatted as a loan.· At the end of seven years -11· there's a put call agreement that's entered into up
12· front that the investor has the option to put their
13· interest in the deal to the project sponsor.· And
14· they anticipate they will do that.· And that's the
15· premise under which everybody gets into these
16· transactions.
17· · · · · · · · ·So more background on METROsquash
18· itself.· As I mentioned, they're a 501(c)(3) that
19· dates back to 2005.· They chose the sport of squash
20· because it's sort of a sport that has very few
21· preconceived notions about it among the youth that
22· they're targeting to serve.
23· · · · · · · · ·It's also a good excuse to get
24· people onto college campuses and get them

·1· average of 39 percent.· So impressive results from
·2· that sister program.
·3· · · · · · · · ·Chicago's program is too new to have
·4· that kind of track record yet, but their first
·5· graduating class entered college this year.· It was
·6· eight students.· Seven out of the eight were first
·7· generation college attendees.· And so they'll be -·8· we'll be tracking that over time, assuming that
·9· this transaction is approved and closes.
10· · · · · · · · ·So as far as the kind of financial
11· profile of METROsquash, fairly small organization;
12· about three quarters of a million dollars a year
13· operating revenue and operating expense.
14· · · · · · · · ·This capital campaign will be a
15· total of $6 1/2 million in addition to the net
16· benefit of the New Markets financing.· So roughly
17· one and a half of that would be an endowment to
18· make sure that they're sustainable over the long
19· term.
20· · · · · · · · ·This facility is also going to give
21· them some new revenue opportunities.· They do a lot
22· of fundraising around squash tournaments, and
23· having high quality squash courts in their own
24· facility means they don't have to rent venue space.

Page 15

Page 17

·1· familiarized with that environment.
·2· · · · · · · · ·And it's a health and wellness
·3· component as well.· So it's kind of blending -·4· squash is kind of the hook to get students in, with
·5· substantial academic enrichment, basically designed
·6· to get students ready for college, get them placed
·7· into their most ideal high schools around Chicago,
·8· assist them in obtaining financial aid, and when
·9· they do get into college, making sure that they're
10· prepared to actually stay there and complete their
11· college education rather than having attrition
12· while they're in school.
13· · · · ALDERMAN AUSTIN:· Do they assist them with
14· any financing?
15· · · · MR. SMITH:· They don't directly give grants
16· to students, but they do a lot of technical
17· assistance in terms of applying for financial aid,
18· mainly grants, and their objective is to make sure
19· students enter college with a sustainable amount of
20· student debt, as little as possible.
21· · · · · · · · ·The Boston program is much older and
22· has reported that two-thirds of their students
23· actually complete four-year college within four
24· years, as compared to the national background

·1· They also would have the ability to rent out their
·2· squash courts during slack times when they're not
·3· using it for student programs.· So U of C, the U of
·4· C Lab School, might take advantage of that to
·5· generate a little program revenue for METROsquash.
·6· · · · · · · · ·I think I kind of covered the gist
·7· of this, but basically the focus on educational
·8· attainment.· They provide enrichment at least three
·9· days a week after school for at least two hours.
10· So it's a very intensive program, it creates a lot
11· of camaraderie among the students, and it's really,
12· as I said, about getting into college in a
13· sustainable way so that they are as positioned as
14· they can be to finish college.
15· · · · · · · · ·The new facility will allow
16· METROsquash to roughly double its capacity over the
17· next two to three years.· Not a huge job creating
18· project, it's really more about the services to low
19· income student population.
20· · · · · · · · ·Projected that it will serve
21· 300 students a year at full operation.
22· · · · · · · · ·And then we covered the kind of
23· integration with the POAH broader redevelopment
24· plan associated with Grove Park and the Choice

·1· Neighborhoods Initiative in that area.
·2· · · · · · · · ·They do anticipate -- METROsquash
·3· anticipates more partnership with Woodlawn area
·4· schools as part of that as well.· So much of that
·5· expansion is anticipated to come from nearby middle
·6· schools and high schools.
·7· · · · · · · · ·As far as the, kind of the economics
·8· of the transaction, so not only would JPMorgan
·9· Chase be the investor through their prefunded
10· qualified equity investment in CDF for $5 million
11· out of the total transaction, they would also put
12· in a million and a half of their own tax credit
13· allocation.· So $6 1/2 million total transaction,
14· which yields about a million and a half in net
15· subsidy to METROsquash, and allows them to start
16· construction much sooner than they would have
17· otherwise and be more financially sustainable in
18· the new facility.
19· · · · · · · · ·I did mention BMO Harris has
20· provided a terms sheet to bridge the unfunded
21· portions of their capital campaign where there's
22· deferred contributions over time.· METROsquash will
23· probably use at least a portion of that bridge loan
24· to make the deal balance financially at closing.

·1· in the neighborhood, engaging them with other
·2· activities, you know, after the school hours, to
·3· make sure that there's productive ways to spend
·4· their time.
·5· · · · · · · · ·There will be a specific safety plan
·6· created for METROsquash's facility.· Rudy Nimocks,
·7· who is a former -·8· · · · CHAIRMAN MOONEY:· Alderman Tunney is joining
·9· us.· We thought you were on a plane.
10· · · · ALDERMAN TUNNEY:· I was.· The planes do land.
11· Efficiently.
12· · · · CHAIRMAN MOONEY:· Good to have you.
13· · · · MR. SMITH:· Rudy Nimocks, former head of the
14· U of C police force, and Chicago Police Department
15· veteran, is on the board of METROsquash, and he's
16· designing the security plan for the facility.· He's
17· also a board member on the Woodlawn Public Safety
18· Alliance.
19· · · · · · · · ·And so the new facility is also only
20· a block from the U of C police headquarters, and
21· it's within the U of C policing boundary.
22· · · · · · · · ·And then POAH further commented
23· that through their redevelopment of the troubled
24· Section 8 units along Cottage Grove, a lot of the

Page 19

Page 21

·1· · · · · · · · ·And I think that's really all I have
·2· on the transaction.
·3· · · · CHAIRMAN MOONEY:· Thank you.
·4· · · · · · · · ·Rafael, the advisory group looked at
·5· the project the other day.· Any comments?
·6· · · · MR. LEON:· Yes, we did, and they were okay.
·7· · · · · · · · ·There were two issues that were
·8· raised about the organization, the strength of the
·9· organization.· And Tony sent an e-mail explaining
10· who was on the board so the board feels comfortable.
11· · · · · · · · ·The other issue that Reverend
12· Tolliver raised was the gang activity and how they
13· plan to get the students to this facility.
14· · · · · · · · ·And you can explain what the
15· resolution of that was.
16· · · · MR. SMITH:· Sure.· So we consulted with
17· METROsquash and with POAH to get more context on
18· the kind of public safety issues in the area.
19· · · · · · · · ·So as part of the Grove Park
20· redevelopment, POAH has really engaged on public
21· safety issues in the broader neighborhood, helping
22· to grow the Woodlawn Public Safety Alliance, which
23· is doing block level community organizing around
24· public safety, and is also targeting at-risk youth

·1· gang territory issues that were initially there
·2· several years ago have been mitigated already.
·3· There's an effort to kind of disperse the
·4· concentrated low -- the poverty from that facility
·5· into the broader neighborhood, and provide more
·6· services and better community design so there's
·7· more kind of safe spaces.
·8· · · · ALDERMAN AUSTIN:· But even though that they
·9· have, U of C have their own security and they're
10· close to there, have they solicited any other
11· security firms?
12· · · · MR. SMITH:· I don't know if they're -13· they've probably brought some level of on site
14· security additionally.· That's part of the security
15· plan that they are developing.· I don't believe
16· they have made a final decision on that yet.
17· · · · ALDERMAN AUSTIN:· Okay.
18· · · · MR. LEON:· So those were the only two
19· concerns that were raised.
20· · · · MS. SCOTT:· How many students do they serve
21· in a year, ballpark?
22· · · · MR. SMITH:· They will serve 300 at full
23· capacity.· They serve about -- 170 now?
24· · · · MR. SIMMONS:· 150.

·1· · · · MR. SMITH:· 150 right now.
·2· · · · ALDERMAN AUSTIN:· See, and that was my
·3· concern.· As they grow the number of students, one
·4· law enforcement wouldn't be able to handle all of
·5· that and their own facility.· So I would like to
·6· know if they have additional solicitation for
·7· others.
·8· · · · · · · · ·And the reason why I ask, because
·9· most of the time when we create a TIF district, we
10· also create an SSA.· So I'm wondering will they be
11· creating something similar to that.
12· · · · MR. SMITH:· Okay.· So the question is will
13· METROsquash actually have on site security presence
14· during their open hours.· Okay.· We can provide
15· that as a followup item.
16· · · · CHAIRMAN MOONEY:· Good question.
17· · · · · · · · ·Other questions?
18· · · · · · · · · · · (No response.)
19· · · · · · · · ·Or comments?
20· · · · · · · · ·Well, even though Alderman Tunney
21· has just joined us, I will still entertain a motion
22· to move ahead with this.
23· · · · MS. HOLT:· Motion.
24· · · · ALDERMAN TUNNEY:· Second.

·1· · · · MR. SMITH:· Yes.· CDF has a stable of
·2· prospective projects that look like they're going
·3· to be ready sometime during 2014.· The amount of
·4· current credits is very limited.· But, you know,
·5· hopefully an award will come in May or June, and
·6· the timing of many of those projects would coincide
·7· with the future allocation that we're all keeping
·8· our fingers crossed for.
·9· · · · ALDERMAN AUSTIN:· Okay.· Very good.· Thank
10· you.
11· · · · MR. LEON:· And just for your information,
12· four new members were appointed to the Advisory
13· Board, and they are -- I just met them two days
14· ago, so I don't remember all the names.
15· · · · MR. SMITH:· Bernita Johnson-Gabriel from
16· QCDC.· Carlos Nelson -17· · · · ALDERMAN AUSTIN:· I thought his name was
18· Nelson Carlos.
19· · · · MR. LEON:· No, Carlos Nelson.
20· · · · MS. KOTAK:· From Auburn Gresham.
21· · · · MR. LEON:· Craig Chico.
22· · · · CHAIRMAN MOONEY:· Craig Chico, Back of the
23· Yards.
24· · · · MR. SMITH:· And Chet Jackson from, I think

·1· · · · CHAIRMAN MOONEY:· Seconded.
·2· · · · · · · · ·All those in favor, say aye.
·3· · · · ALDERMAN TUNNEY:· Well, since I'm a former
·4· squash player, Cornell, I'd be interested to see
·5· the interest and the supervision.
·6· · · · ALDERMAN AUSTIN:· I will too.
·7· · · · CHAIRMAN MOONEY:· This actually came to my
·8· door when I was at LISC back in 2003 or '4,
·9· and Jonathan Fanton was still at the MacArthur
10· Foundation.· He was one of the prime movers.
11· He was a big squash player.· And I had become
12· associated with this group, and he and a number of
13· others, I think in the training world, actually,
14· who were squash players, helped pull the
15· organization, and have been highly supportive ever
16· since.
17· · · · ALDERMAN TUNNEY:· And that would merge with
18· the handball players at Rainbow Beach.
19· · · · CHAIRMAN MOONEY:· All right.· I think that's
20· all we have.
21· · · · ALDERMAN AUSTIN:· I have one question.
22· · · · CHAIRMAN MOONEY:· Go ahead.
23· · · · ALDERMAN AUSTIN:· Do we have any other
24· applicants in the queue besides these?

·1· it's West Humboldt Park Community Council.
·2· · · · CHAIRMAN MOONEY:· Those are good people.
·3· · · · · · · · ·Okay.· Well, I wish everyone happy
·4· holidays, safe holidays.
·5· · · · · · · · ·Is there a motion to adjourn?
·6· · · · ALDERMAN AUSTIN:· Move to adjourn.
·7· · · · MS. SCOTT:· Second.
·8· · · · CHAIRMAN MOONEY:· All in favor, say aye.
·9· · · · · · · · · · · (Chorus of ayes.)
10· · · · CHAIRMAN MOONEY:· Thanks to the staff.
11· Excellent work.
