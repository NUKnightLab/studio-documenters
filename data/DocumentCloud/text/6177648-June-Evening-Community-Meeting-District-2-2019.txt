Re: Resolution to recognize THE as a non-pro?t Organization

The SAVE THE PEARLS organization is requesting to be recognized by The Honorable City
Council of Detroit as a nonpro?t organization in the community. SAVE THE PEARLS is a
50] C3 non-pro?t organization whose mission is to ?ght Human Traf?cking and abuse of
Children. SAVE THE works to complete its mission by bringing awareness and
education to its neighborhoods and surrounding communities on the identification of children
(The Pearls) at risk of human trafficking and/or abuse through presentations, workshops, and
publications.

The SAVE THE PEARLS organization has been in existence since February 13, 2018, and during
that brief times its presence has touched more than 500 individuals. Through its grassroots efforts
SAVE THE PEARLS has: sponsored charitable fundraising events; interfaced with sheltering
organizations; participated in training and networking with like groups and organizations; and
provided enlightenment and knowledge to local communities to understand, minimize, and
hopefully eradicate Human Traf?cking. In the future SAVE THE PEARLS plans to continue its
effort to ?ght Human Traf?cking and abuse of Children by conducting many more such events.

SAVE THE PEARLS is planning future fundraising events that may require a charitable gaming
license. The Charitable Gaming Division requires that all community organizations retain a
resolution from their local governing body to obtain a charitable gaming license. SAVE THE
PEARLS is presenting this request to obtain recognition in the City of Detroit as nonpro?t
organization and assure compliance with any governmental requirements. SAVE THE PEARLS
pledges that all proceeds received by this organization will be used to ?ght Human Traf?cking
and abuse of Children in the City of Detroit and the State of Michigan.

If you have any questions or concerns, please contact Ms. Torleice Anderson at

Re: Save the Pearls CT 59715
Dear Ms. Anderson:

Thank you for submitting initial forms and related information.
Determinations are based on Michigan laws for registering charities, the Charitable
Organizations and Solicitations Act (COSA), MCL 400.271 et seq. and the
Supervision of Trustees for Charitable Purposes Act (STCPA), MCL 14.251 et seq.

It appears this organization does not compensate staff or independent
contractors for services related to fundraising. Additionally, the organization does
not anticipate Soliciting or receiving contributions in excess of $25,000 in a 12-
month period. Therefore, a Charitable Solicitation Registration is not required
under COSA. If in the future, staff or independent contractors are paid for services
related to fundraising or contributions exceed $25,000 in a 12-month period, notify
our of?ce as registration under COSA will likely be required. The Charitable
Solicitation Registration is separate from the requirements of the Bureau of State
Lottery and other agencies.

It appears this organization holds assets in Michigan to be used for
charitable purposes. The organization is new registered as a charitable trust under
STCPA. Registration under STCPA requires an annual report. Annual ?nancial
accountings must be ?led six (6) months following the close of each ?scal year.
Accountings may be a copy of the IRS 990, 990-PF, 990-EZ, a certi?ed audit, or
other acceptable accounting. If the IRS does not require ?ling, you may submit a
completed IRS 990 or 990-EZ to our of?ce to ful?ll the reporting requirement.

This letter will be retained to show noti?cation of our requirements. If you
have questions, please go to our website at or contact our of?ce.
