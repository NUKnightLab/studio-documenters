SCHEDULE B – APPLICATIONS FOR ANNUITIES
1.

Employee Annuities

Mr. Walsh reviewed the starred case pertaining to the reinstatement of the annuity benefits for Charles D. Settino.
Mr. Walsh noted that Mr. Settino’s annuity with LABF started in 1992 and was later suspended by LABF in 1997
because Mr. Settino went to work for the Chicago Park District which was deemed an Employer whose employees
participated in the LABF. Consistent with the applicable provisions of the Illinois Pension Code, LABF’s practice
in these situations has always been to suspend benefits when an employee goes to work for an entity deemed an
Employer and only reinstate the benefits if the employee subsequently terminates employment with the related
Employer. Since Mr. Settino has subsequently stopped working at the Chicago Park District, it was Fund staff’s
recommendation to reinstate Mr. Settino’s annuity effective March 1, 2018. Mr. Walsh also reminded the Trustees
of LABF’s definition of Employer which was reviewed in 2017.
It was moved by Trustee Capasso, seconded by Trustee LoVerde, that the applications for Employee Annuities be
approved and ordered paid.
Roll-call:

For -- Trustees Roa, Keane, LoVerde, Summers, Capasso and Joiner.
Against -- None.

ADMINISTRATIVE REPORT
Legislative Matters
Mr. Walsh reviewed the status of House Bill 4811, which was, in part, a trailer bill to P.A. 100-0023, and noted that
the Bill had passed both the House and Senate and was ready to be sent to the Governor for signature. Mr. Walsh
also reminded the Trustees of some of the additional issues with P.A. 100-0023 that were not addressed in House Bill
4811. Finally, Mr. Walsh provided Trustees with a copy of a memo prepared by the Fund’s Legislative Liaison
discussing the status of other legislation. See attached copy of memo.
Annual Financing Resolution
Mr. Walsh reviewed some of the discussions and decisions leading up to the final version of the Annual Financing
Resolution that the Trustees approved in 2017. He also reminded the Board that, per the Board’s request, Fund
Counsel sent a letter to the City’s Corporation Counsel last year asking that Corporation Counsel confirm the Fund’s
analysis regarding the City’s obligation under 40 ILCS 5/11-176 and schedule a time to discuss the mechanics. Mr.
Walsh updated the Board regarding the meeting which occurred in late March of 2018. Mr. Walsh explained that
following the meeting with representatives from Corporation Counsel’s office, LABF staff conducted some additional
research, the findings from which were presented to the Board in a report called Review of LABF Financing Request
(see attached). After reviewing the report, a number of the Trustees made suggestions as to what should be requested
as part of this year’s Annual Financing Resolution. The Trustees asked Mr. Walsh to review certain component parts
of the annual request for funding with Fund Counsel and they also requested copies of the communications between
Fund Counsel and the City’s Corporation Counsel on this matter. The Trustees also asked for this item to be further
discussed at the June 19, 2018 meeting.
Beneficiary Designation Review
Mr. Walsh reviewed the current process and procedures in place at LABF related to beneficiary designation forms.
Mr. Walsh noted that there are many scenarios not covered by the current beneficiary designation form and procedures
and he asked to possibly broaden the current procedures in order to cover additional scenarios. Mr. Walsh proposed a
few modifications to the current beneficiary designation procedures for the Trustees to consider. The Trustees asked
if other laws, such as estate laws, were in conflict with the proposed changes and asked Fund staff and Fund Counsel
to review the matter. The Trustees approved the proposed changes to the beneficiary designation procedure pending
a review by Fund Counsel.
Miscellaneous
Harassment Training - Mr. Walsh discussed the possibility of providing harassment training for LABF Staff and LABF
Trustees. He mentioned that Fund Counsel has conducted such trainings in the past and could provide training for the
LABF. The Trustees were unanimous in their support for this type of training.

held on September 28, 2018.

o Based on Actuarial Value of Assets:  
48.3% 
o Based on Market Value of Assets:   
49.2% 
o Statutory contribution for 2018 ($48.0 million) is significantly lower than the ADC

$48 million in payment year 2019, $60 million in payment year 2020, $72 million in 
payment year 2021 and $84 million in payment year 2022. For payment years after 
2022, the City contribution equals the sum of the net employer normal cost plus a level 
percent of payroll amortization of the unfunded liability needed to attain a 90 percent 
funded ratio by 2058 on an open group basis. 
o The statutory employer multiple is 3.08; the recommended multiple based on ADC 
funding is 8.28. 
Projected funded ratio

return), the funded ratio is projected to decline from 48.3 percent in 2017 to 44.3 
percent in 2020 and then increase gradually to 90.0 percent in 2058.  However, the 
funded ratio doesn’t reach 50 percent until 2045.

 The increase in the Funded Ratio for fiscal year 2014 of 8.41 percent was a result of the benefit changes provided in P.A. 98‐0641. The Public Act was ruled 

unconstitutional and void in its entirety on July 24, 2015, resulting in a decrease in the Funded Ratio for fiscal year 2015 of 9.33 percent.

RE: Spring?eld Update
DATE: Thursday, May 17, 2018

The following is the current status of the bills that directly affect the LABF Chicago or are of
signi?cant interest:

HB 4811 (Zalewski) changes a provision to the Municipal Fund (not the LABF) that provides
that each disabled employee who receives duty or ordinary disability bene?t shall be examined at
least once a year, or a longer period of time as determined by the Board of the Fund (rather than
shall be examined at least once a year), by one or more licensed and practicing physicians
appointed by the Board. Effective immediately.

House Amendment #1 to HB 4811 was adopted in the House Personnel and Pensions Committee
on April 25. House Amendment #1 is the trailer cleanup language to Public Act 100-23.The bill
passed out of the Senate Licensed Activities and Pensions Committee on May 10 en a vote of
9-0-0 and is now on Second Reading in the Senate. Deadline for ?nal passage of all bills is
Friday, May 25.

HB 4413 (Ammons) provides that any open meeting of the board of trustees of a retirement
system or pension fund or any committee established by a retirement system or pension fund
must be broadcast to the public and maintained in real-time on the retirement system?s or
pension fund?s website using a high?speed internet connection. HB 4413 was amended to add the
following language to the above: A retirement system or pension fund must make audio and
video available for a meeting broadcast and maintained under this subsection. The bill passed the
House on April 18, as amended, on a roll call vote of 71-39?1. The bill is now in the Senate in
the Committee on Assignment of bills.

Please be aware that the Legislative Spring Session is still scheduled to end on May 31, 2018. It
is expected that the House of Representatives and the State Senate Democrats will be passing a
Democratic budget without Republican agreement.

Therefore, it will be up to the Governor to decide whether to accept this budget in full, perform
amendatory line item vetoes, or execute a total veto of the bill. I will keep you informed of all
pertinent developments.

However, Democrats will continue to work over the next three weeks to reach a bipartisan
agreement regarding the budget.

 Key Takeaways:
1. Historically, Illinois Pension Code Section 11-169 Financing; Tax levy (Chapter 24, Section 11 of the Illinois Revised
Statutes in 1935) served the following two primary functions: (1) it authorized the levying of additional property
taxes for pension fund purposes, and (2) it set a limit, or cap, on the amount that could be levied. Other sections
of the law, many of which are listed in the Determination of City Contribution Requirements section below, were
to be used to determine the sum required for the various purposes under the law. However, the sum of these
amounts often exceeded the tax levy cap under Section 11-169. When this was the case, the amount that the
LABF could request of the City of Chicago was limited to the tax levy cap amount. The tax levy cap provision was
so routinely applied in the last few decades that it might have appeared as though Section 11-169 was the sole
determinant of the required City contribution when, in fact, it was not. However, this may have changed with the
enactment of Public Act 100-0023 on July 6, 2017, when Section 11-169 went from establishing a tax levy cap to
actually specifying the contribution amount.
2. Pension law specifies that in lieu of all amounts ordinarily contributed by an employee and by the City for annuity
purposes, the City is required to contribute sums equal to such amounts for any period during which the employee
receives a duty disability benefit from LABF. However, the sum of such amounts, together with the sums required
for all other purposes under the law, are subject to the tax levy cap specified in Section 11-169. Since the
aggregate amount of the sums for all other purposes (non-duty disability related purposes) already exceeded the
authorized tax levy cap every levy year since 1970, there were no additional contributions to be made by the City
related to those members receiving a duty disability benefit.
3. Given that the City of Chicago has had the ability since 1997 to utilize sources in lieu of the tax levy for the purpose
of financing its contribution obligations to LABF, the LABF should not have to absorb a reduction in contributions
associated with the property tax loss and cost of collections.

General Legislative Background
The LABF was created on June 21, 1935 upon the passage of House Bill 968 (“The 1935 Act”), amending Chapter 24
(Villages and Cities) of the Illinois Revised Statutes. In 1963, the Statues were amended to create the Illinois Pension Code
(Chapter 40), which continues to govern all the public retirement systems and pension funds in the State.

Purpose of Sec. 11-169 Financing; Tax Levy
Historically, Illinois Pension Code Section 11-169 Financing; Tax levy (Chapter 24, Section 11 of the Illinois Revised Statutes
prior to 1963) has served two primary functions. First, this section gives the City of Chicago the authority to levy a property
tax for pension financing purposes and specifies that such tax is to be in addition to the amount the City is separately
authorized to levy for general purposes. Although most of the applicable language from the 1935 Act still exists in Section
11-169 of the Illinois Pension Code, the language from the 1935 Act more clearly conveys the intent of this provision in
the law. The 1935 Act, in relevant part, reads as follows:
It shall be lawful for any such city to levy a tax upon all taxable property in such city for the purpose
of providing revenue for the annuity and benefit fund herein provided for, which fund is and shall be
construed to be a pension fund. Such tax shall, until January 1, 1940, be not more than one-tenth (1/10)
of one mill, and for the period of two years beginning January 1, 1940, such tax shall be not more than
two-tenths (2/10) of one mill, and thereafter shall be not more than twenty-nine one-hundredths (29/100)
of one mill, on the dollar of the assessed valuation of all taxable property in such city.

1

 For such purpose, beginning in the year in which this Act shall come in force and effect in such city, the
city council of such city shall levy such a tax annually upon all taxable property in such city at the rate on
the dollar of the assessed valuation of all such taxable property that will produce a sum which, when
added to the amounts deducted from the salaries of all persons included under the provisions of this Act
and applied to the annuity and benefit fund herein provided for, will be sufficient for the purpose of said
fund in accordance with the provisions of this Act. Said tax shall be levied and collected in like manner
with the general taxes of such city, and shall be in addition to all other taxes which such city is now or
may hereafter be authorized to levy upon the aggregate valuation of all taxable property within such
city, and shall be exclusive of and in addition to the amount of tax such city is now or may hereafter be
authorized to levy for general purposes under and by virtue of section 1 of Article VIII of an Act entitled,
"An Act to provide for the incorporation of cities and villages," approved April 10, 1872, in force July 1,
1872, as subsequently amended, or under and by virtue of any other law or laws which may limit the
amount of tax which such city may levy for general purposes. The county clerk of the county in which
such city is located, in reducing tax levies under the provisions of an Act entitled, "An Act concerning the
levy and extension of taxes," approved May 9, 1901, in force July 1, 1901, as subsequently amended, shall
not consider any such tax as a part of the general tax levy for city purposes, and shall not include the
same in any limitation of the assessed valuation upon which taxes are required to be extended.
The amount of the tax to be levied in each year shall be certified to the city council of such city by the
retirement board of the annuity and benefit fund herein provided for.
As soon as any revenue derived from the said tax shall be collected, the same shall be paid to the
treasurer of such city and shall be held by such treasurer for the benefit of the annuity and benefit fund
herein provided for, and all such revenue shall be paid into said annuity and benefit fund in accordance
with the provisions of this Act.
If the funds available for the purposes of this Act shall be insufficient during any year to meet the
requirements of this Act, such city may issue tax anticipation warrants, as provided by law, against the
tax levy herein provided for, for the current year.
The various sums, hereinafter stated, to be contributed by such city for the purposes of this Act and any
interest to be contributed by such city in accordance with the provisions of this Act, shall be taken from
the revenue derived from said tax, and no money of such city derived from any source other than the levy
and collection of said tax or the sale of tax anticipation warrants in accordance with the provisions of this
section shall be used to provide revenue for the annuity and benefit fund herein provided for.
Second, prior to the enactment of Public Act 100-0023 on July 6, 2017, Section 11-169 (Chapter 24, Section 11 of the
Illinois Revised Statutes prior to 1963) served to place a limit, or cap, on the amount of property tax that could be levied
by the City of Chicago for pension contribution purposes. From 1935 to 1969, the limit was determined based on a flat
percentage of taxable property within the City of Chicago. Due primarily to increases in LABF membership, the flat
percentage of taxable property often failed to generate an amount sufficient to provide the sums required for the various
purposes under the law (see the Determination of City Contribution Requirements section below). In other words, although
the law specified certain sums were to be contributed by the City for certain purposes, the City’s contribution was capped.
To address this issue, Public Act 76-1509 was enacted on September 22, 1969 and changed the tax cap calculation
methodology, moving it from a flat percentage of taxable property to a multiple of the amount employees contributed
two years prior. As a result, the maximum authorized levy amount began to fluctuate based on total pensionable salary,
which more closely correlated with the total sum of the required contributions under the law. The following language
from the law makes it clear that Section 11-169 served to limit the amount of property tax that could be levied for pension
contribution purposes:
2

 •

From 1935 to 1969: “such tax shall be not more than” [followed by a flat percentage of taxable property
which was amended from time-to-time as shortfalls arose]

•

From 1970 to 2017: “…the city shall levy a tax annually at a rate on the dollar of the value, as equalized
or assessed by the Department of Revenue of all taxable property within such city that will produce, when
extended, not to exceed an amount equal to the total amount of contributions by the employees to the
fund made in the calendar year 2 years prior to the year for which the annual applicable tax is levied,
multiplied by 1.1 for the years 1970, 1971 and 1972; 1.145 for the year 1973; 1.19 for the year 1974; 1.235
for the year 1975; 1.280 for the year 1976; 1.325 for the year 1977; 1.370 for the years 1978 through 1998;
and 1.000 for the year 1999 and for each year thereafter through levy year 2016.”

On July 6, 2017, Public Act 100-0023 became law and amended Section 11-169. As a result of the amendment, the law
appears to no longer set the contribution cap, but rather to specify the amount that “shall be” contributed. Unfortunately,
the language now conflicts with the many other sections of the law that also specify an amount that the City must
contribute (see Determination of City Contribution Requirement). However, given the evolution of the pension law, it
seems reasonable to conclude that the contribution requirement now specified in Section 11-169 trumps, or effectively
replaces, the contribution requirements specified elsewhere in the law. The following are excerpts from Section 11-169
as it reads today:
•

From levy year 2017 to 2021 (payment year 2018 to 2022): Beginning in payment year 2018, the city's
required annual contribution to the Fund for payment years 2018 through 2022 shall be: for 2018,
$36,000,000; for 2019, $48,000,000; for 2020, $60,000,000; for 2021, $72,000,000; and for 2022,
$84,000,000.

•

From levy year 2022 to 2057 (payment year 2023 to 2058): the city's required annual contribution to the
Fund shall be equal to the amount, if any, needed to bring the total actuarial assets of the Fund up to 90%
of the total actuarial liabilities of the Fund as of the end of the year.

Determination of Sums Required for Various Purposes Under the Law
Listed below are excerpts from Article 11 of the Illinois Pension Code that specify the various sums to be contributed by
the City of Chicago. As mentioned above, these sections now conflict with the language in Section 11-169 which
separately specifies the required amount. Public Act 100-0023 may have effectively rendered the following sections
obsolete.
Sec. 11-146. Compensation annuity and supplemental annuity. [Sec. 33 of 1935 Act]
The city shall contribute to the fund each year the amount required for all Compensation Annuities.
Supplemental Annuity shall be provided from city contributions after the date of the employee's death, of
such equal sums annually, which when improved by interest at the effective rate, will be sufficient, at the
time payment of Compensation Annuity to the widow ceases to provide Supplemental Annuity, as stated,
for the widow throughout her life thereafter.
Sec. 11-160.1. Payments to city. (healthcare subsidies)
The payments described in this subsection shall be paid from the tax levy authorized under Section 11169; such amounts shall be credited to the reserve for group hospital care and group medical and surgical
plan benefits, and all payments to the city required under this subsection shall be charged against it.
Sec. 11-170(b). Contributions for age and service annuities for present employees, future entrants and re-entrants.
(prior to enactment of PA 100-0023) [Sec. 16 & Sec. 17 of 1935 Act]
3

 Concurrently with each employee contribution, the city shall contribute beginning on the effective date
and prior to July 1, 1947, 5 3/4%; and beginning July 1, 1947 and prior to July 1, 1953, 7%; and beginning
July 1, 1953, 6% of each payment of such salary until the employee attains age 65.
Sec. 11-171. Additional contributions and credits-All employees. (Employees in service as of 7/1/1947 had the option
to make an additional contribution)
“Concurrently with each such additional contribution, the city shall contribute 1 and 4/10 times the
additional contribution.”
Sec. 11-174(b). Contributions for widow's annuity for widows of present employees, future entrants and re-entrants.
[Sec. 21 and 22 of 1935 Act]
Concurrently with each employee contribution, the city shall contribute beginning on the effective date
and prior to July 1, 1947, 1 3/4%; and beginning July 1, 1947, 2% of salary.
Sec. 11-176. Contributions by city for duty disability benefit. [Sec. 46 of 1935 Act]
In lieu of all amounts ordinarily contributed by an employee and by the city for age and service annuity,
and widow's annuity the city shall contribute sums equal to such amounts for any period during which the
employee receives a duty disability benefit under this Article, or a temporary total disability benefit under
the Workers' Compensation Act if the disability results from a condition commonly termed heart attack or
stroke or any other condition falling within the broad field of coronary involvement or heart disease, to be
credited to the disabled employee for annuity purposes as though he were in active discharge of his duties
during any such period of disability.
Sec. 11-177. Contributions by city for ordinary disability benefit. [Sec. 47 of 1935 Act]
The city shall contribute all amounts ordinarily contributed by it for annuity purposes for any employee
receiving ordinary disability benefit as though he were in active discharge of his duties during such period
of disability.
Sec. 11-178. Contributions by city for prior service annuities and other benefits. [Sec. 53 of 1935 Act]
The city shall make contributions to provide prior service and widow's prior service annuities, and other
annuities and benefits, as follows…
Sec. 11-179. Contribution by city for administration costs. [Sec. 13 of 1935 Act]
The city shall contribute from revenue derived from taxes herein authorized, the amount necessary to
defray costs of administration of the fund. Beginning July 1, 1987, the board shall estimate and approve a
budget for the entire cost of administration of the fund required each year to be contributed by the city by
its regular January meeting for the current fiscal year.

Tax Levy Loss and Cost of Collections
For a variety of reasons, not every dollar of property tax levied within the City of Chicago is actually received. According
to a letter from Donald F. Campbell, LABF’s actuary, dated November 29, 1943, “A law was enacted in 1943 allowing us to
anticipate a reserve for loss and cost of collections” associated with the tax levy. Therefore, in many of the years where
the tax levy cap had not already been reached, the LABF requested an amount in excess of the financing requirements
under the law such that when the tax levy loss and cost of collections were realized, the actual contribution to LABF
approximated the financing requirements. In 1945, LABF assumed a loss and cost of collections of 10%, but this figure
fluctuated anywhere from 7.5% to 10% for the purposes of the 1945 through 1969 tax levy requests. Beginning with the
1970 tax levy request, when the multiplier methodology was first used to determine the tax levy cap, the required
4

 contributions under the law exceeded the tax levy cap. Therefore, since the amount being requested had already reached
the cap, the amount could not be increased any further in anticipation of the loss and cost of collections.
On June 27, 1997, Public Act 90-0031 was enacted which allowed the City to begin utilizing sources other than the property
tax levy to finance its contribution requirements. The law added subsection (f) of Section 11-169, which reads as follows:
In lieu of levying all or a portion of the tax required under this Section in any year, the city may deposit
with the city treasurer no later than March 1 of that year for the benefit of the fund, to be held in
accordance with this Article, an amount that, together with the taxes levied under this Section for that
year, is not less than the amount of the city contributions for that year as certified by the board to the
city council. The deposit may be derived from any source legally available for that purpose, including,
but not limited to, the proceeds of city borrowings. The making of a deposit shall satisfy fully the
requirements of this Section for that year to the extent of the amounts so deposited.
In accordance with this provision, the City has since utilized sources such as State Personal Property Replacement Tax, City
of Chicago Corporate Fund and various of its Enterprise Funds, in addition to the tax levy, to finance its contribution
obligations to LABF. Despite the additional authorized financing sources, the actual city contribution continually falls short
of the requested amount due to a loss associated with the portion of its contribution financed by the tax levy. It is
questionable as to whether the City has the legal authority to pass along the shortfall to the LABF since it has the authority
to make up the shortfall from “any source legally available”.

Gentlemen:
Re: Tar Levy Reselutien Fer reer 1354.

In my letters te the Beard dated Deteher 34.
1951 fer the 1952 tax levy, and 3entemher 35, 1933
fer the 1953 tar levy. I estimated that a tar levy
ef fer each at these years weuld e?
mertise the defisit in sheet nineteen ?191 veers
fer the 1953 levy. and eheut eighteen 13} veers
fer the 19h3 leer.

The Beerd?e tar leer reselutien fer the
veers ef 1353 and 1953 was fer eesh
year.

This annual tar 19?? ef I
estimate still will previde eums such that the defi?
eit ef the Fund will he amnrtizad well within the
thirty veer emnrtizetien period set in the Act
in the yeer 1349. Altheugh the lengt? ef time it
will take te emertiee the deficit eennet he deter-
mined eeserately until the effect of the 1953 a-
mendments is determined and the annual statements
ere templeted the changes will net he ef such an
emeunt te ehenge the remaining emertiretien period
Very fer {rem eighteen veers at present based en
three {31 per cent interest earnings.

Re: Tan Levy Eesnlutinn For Year 1956.

Gentlemen:

In my letter to the Beard dated August 26, 1956 I
estimated that a tan; levy of for the year 195?
enuld amortize the deficit within the thirty (36) year amorti-
satien set up in the set in the year mes.

The Board's tax levy reselutinn fer eachef the
years from 1952 to 1956, bath inclusive, was for 

 

 

If this same sum of is levied for the
year 1956, I estimate that it will provide sums such that the
deficit to the Fund'mill be amortized within the thirty year
amortisation period. Although the length of time it will take

 

to amortize the deficit cannot be determined accurately until

the effect 6f the 195? amendments is determined and the annual

statement for 195? is I estimate that the operating

experienee of the Fund Ear 1956 will not differ materially

item that far the year 195? and that the remaining amortisation
period will be completed before the year l9?9.

Based an such estimate the detail of the levy meuld
be as fblloms:

City Contributions Fer Empleyees' 
City For Wives? Annuities.. 
City For Crdinary Disability 
City Contributions For Expense CE administratinn 69,699.69

the City tn be and fur the Park District to he


 


The mueunt ef tea levy for the year 1962 fer the

City 1was and far thelParh Distriet sameness. 

 

 

 

 

If present feature affecting seats ramain aheut
as at present a tax levy sf for the City and of
fur the Park District. hath levies allowing fer a 795i
reserve fer less and nest ef enlleetinn. I estimate amulet smartise
the Fund's deficit within a period sf about twenty-three yEara
from January 1, 1953.

 

 

This perind is about seven years lenger than the
thirty year amnrtieatien peried provided fer in the set.

Future changes in these factors will result: in
different tax levy requirements.

The rate of f?tnra retirements; ameunt Df future
salaries, and rate Df intErest earnings are the principal factors.
The aetual future experience will shew the extent ef any variatiens
