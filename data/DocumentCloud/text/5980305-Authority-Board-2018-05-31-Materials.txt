May 31st ICJIA Board Meeting Overview

The Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority’s (ICJIA) Quarterly Board Meeting will
be held Thursday, May 31st, from 10:00 a.m. to 12:30 pm. at the Michael A. Bilandic
Building (160 N. LaSalle in Chicago), room N-505. (Please note, we have changed the
meeting to Thursday at 10:00 to better accommodate members’ attendance.) To enter the
Bilandic Building, visitors must present a valid State I.D. and pass through a metal detector.
All ICJIA Board meetings are subject to the Open Meetings Act. Members of the general
public are encouraged to attend.
ICJIA’s statutorily-created oversight Board serves a unique and vital role in improving the
State’s public safety outcomes. Composed of state and local public safety officials, policy
experts, and community leaders, the Board is designed to embody and represent the state’s
criminal justice system. It is tasked with setting agency priorities, tracking the progress of
ongoing programs, and overseeing the agency’s grant-making. To that end, ICJIA’s quarterly
Board meetings bring research and practical insights to bear on important and emerging
issues affecting public safety in Illinois, with the goal of identifying how the agency should
address them through research and grant-making.
At the meeting, executive staff will provide Members with essential updates on the agency’s
work. This will include updates on our federal formula grants, state-funded programs, and
our strategic policy initiatives. We also anticipate presenting the 2018 Candice M. Kane
Lifetime Service Award.
After these updates, the meeting will turn to a presentation on the recently released report
from the Illinois Mental Health Opportunities for Youth Diversion Task Force: Stemming the
Tide. You can find the report here and attached to this email. Following the presentation,
ICJIA staff will facilitate a discussion with members on how the report’s findings and
recommendations can inform ICJIA’s work.
We look forward to your participation and guidance,
John Maki
Executive Director
