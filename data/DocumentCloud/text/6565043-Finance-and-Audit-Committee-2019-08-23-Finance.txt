ACTION ITEMS
SFY 2020 Draft Overall Work Program (OWP)
Ms. Daila Shimek provided background on the OWP and reviewed the development schedule
that will be presented to the Board for approval in June 2019.
Ms. Shimek highlighted the work activities that will be performed by NOACA’s division units and
she reviewed the following:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

SFY 2020 Operating Budget - $8.2 million
Pass-through funding - $4.9 million (TLCI program - $2.0 million and 5310 program $2.9 million)
Staffing of 47 positions
Budget assumptions (3% merit increases and 5% health insurance costs)
Revenues (federal, state, and local)
Budgets (employee benefits, training and professional dues, contractual services, other
operating expenses, occupancy and equipment, capital outlay, and salaries/wages)
Comparison of SFY 2019 to SFY 2020
Budget by work activity

Ms. Shimek stated that public review would begin after staff receives a recommendation from the
Finance and Audit Committee. She noted that pending Board approval, the final OWP and Budget
will be sent to ODOT and federal agencies for approval.
Mayor Ritenauer asked staff to talk about the positions that need to be filled at NOACA.
Ms. Gallucci said NOACA is looking to hire a modeler and long-range planners. She noted that
one of the long-range planners will be in a leadership position.
Mayor Hunter asked if there is enough money in the budget to take care of the present staff and
cover the increasing cost of healthcare benefits.
Ms. Gallucci stated that the budget includes the following: merit increases, which are given based
on performance reviews; employee raises ranging between 0 - 4.5% (average 3%); rewards for
staff who become certified planners or engineers; employee assistance program; and a gym
membership match (50% of the fee or up to $25 per month). Ms. Gallucci welcomed suggestions
from the Committee on other benefits NOACA could provide its employees.
Mayor Ritenauer asked how many employees NOACA will have with the additional employees
that will be hired in SFY 2020. Ms. Shimek said NOACA will have 44 employees and fringe
benefits will account for about 1/3 of the employee-related expenses of $470,000. Ms. Gallucci
mentioned that NOACA has three floating vacancies.

8234c

1-2

 Engineer Gills asked the maximum salary for the long-range planning positions. Ms. Gallucci said
the minimum salary of the leadership long-range planning position is about $95,000. She
informed Engineer Gills that she could tell him the maximum salary of the position after the
meeting.
Mr. Foley talked about the need to amp up the infrastructure for electric vehicle charging stations
in the region.
Mayor Ritenauer asked staff to talk about the 5% increase in healthcare costs and what staff sees
happening in the next 12-18 months. Ms. Billie Geyer stated that the increase is similar to prior
increases and said she believed Lorain County may come up with more divisions / categories,
which would lower some of NOACA’s costs.
A motion was made by Mayor Hunter to recommend the SFY 2020 OWP and Budget to the
Executive Committee. The motion was seconded by Chief Valarie McCall. The motion passed
by voice vote.
Regional Strategic Transit Plan
Ms. Susanna Merlone reviewed the benefits of public transit and explained the goal of the
Regional Strategic Transit Plan. She stated that a request for proposal (RFP) was released on
March 8, 2019, closed on April 17, 2019, and two proposals were submitted to NOACA.
Ms. Merlone also reviewed the evaluation criteria and noted that the selection committee
determined that AECOM Technical Services, Inc. best met the selection criteria.
Ms. Merlone stated that pending Board approval, NOACA will enter into a contract with AECOM
Technical Services, Inc., for an amount not to exceed $148,916. She stated that the project will
begin on or around July 1, 2019, and will end approximately on December 1, 2020.
A motion was made by Mayor Hunter to recommend the Regional Strategic Transit Plan to the
Executive Committee. The motion was seconded by Mr. Foley.
Ms. Gallucci mentioned that 33% of NOACA’s funding comes from the Federal Transit
Administration (FTA) and noted that NOACA secured a grant through ODOT to cover the cost of
the plan.
The Committee voted and the motion passed by voice vote.
Contract Amendment – Great Lakes Hyperloop Feasibility Study
Ms. Kathy Sarli presented information on the contract amendment for the Great Lakes Hyperloop
Feasibility Study. She reviewed the project scope that includes the following phases:
•
•
•
•

Phase 1: Project Objectives and Organization

8234c

1-3

 Pennsylvania being added to the route. She mentioned that the contract term would be extended
to October 31, 2019.
A motion was made by Mayor Michael Gammella to recommend the contract amendment for the
Great Lakes Hyperloop Feasibility Study to the Executive Committee. The motion was seconded
by Mayor Brennan.
Mayor Hunter commented on the interest of other states looking to get involved in the Hyperloop.
He said the Hyperloop is a great idea and noted that NOACA should stay at the forefront.
The Committee voted and the motion passed by voice vote.
LOR Avon Citywide Bicycle and Multi-use Path TLCI Study
Mr. Randy Lane provided background on the LOR Avon Citywide Bicycle and Multi-use Path TLCI
Study. He stated that the sponsors received $30,000 in TLCI funds in March 2018 and requested
$15,000 from the 2019 TLCI funding cycle, but was not recommended for funding as an
independent project. NOACA staff met with the sponsors to get a better understanding of the
regional context of needs. Mr. Lane stated that the total cost of the study area extension is
$20,000, so NOACA would increase its funding commitment to this project by $15,000; Lorain
County Metro Parks would provide the local match of $5,000; the existing Avon TLCI consultant
contract would be modified in scope and cost; and communities would partner in performance of
the study. Mr. Lane noted that the increase would be funded utilizing savings from other TLCI
projects and there would be no impact to other projects funded through the TLCI program or TIP.
Mr. Lane stated that upon Board approval, staff will amend the existing LPA agreement and the
consultant contract for additional scope and funds, and continue to work with the communities
and the consultant to ensure the completion of the TLCI study.
Ms. Gallucci mentioned that the request was brought up at a Board meeting during a discussion
on the TLCI recommendations. She said there was a misunderstanding of whether the request
was for a planning or implementation project, so staff did not approve it at that time. She noted
that staff has since reviewed the project and corrected the issues.
A motion was made by Mayor Hunter to recommend the LOR Avon Citywide Bicycle and Multiuse Path TLCI Study to the Executive Committee. The motion was seconded by Mayor Brennan.
The motion passed by voice vote.
Ms. Gallucci thanked Mayor Hunter and Mayor Bryan Jensen for submitting the request to
NOACA. She noted that the path will be a regional asset.
Mayor Hunter thanked the Committee for its support and NOACA staff, Mayor Jensen and Mr. Jim
Ziemnik for their assistance with this project. Mayor Hunter talked about the various connections
to the trail.
Ms. Gallucci stated that had staff had a better understanding of the project, it would have been
part of the original recommendation.
CUY North Royalton State Street Sidewalks TLCI Implementation
Mr. Lane stated that the City of North Royalton submitted to NOACA a request to have $100,000
in TLCI funds transferred from State Road Sidewalks Phase II to State Road Sidewalks Phase I.

8234c

1-4

 He noted that the transfer would increase the funding for Phase I to $208,900 and reduce the
funding for Phase II to $0. Mr. Lane stated that pending Board approval, NOACA will coordinate
with the city and ODOT to reprogram the funds.
A motion was made by Mr. Foley to recommend the CUY North Royalton State Street Sidewalks
TLCI implementation to the Executive Committee. The motion was seconded by Mayor Hunter.
Engineer Gills asked if the project has been awarded. Mr. Lane said yes. Engineer Gills asked
how the project was awarded if the bid came in 60% over the estimate.
Mr. Lane stated that ODOT’s specifications do allow for a local agency to proceed on a local
project with recognition and acknowledgment that they would fund the overage and in
consideration of a correction to the original estimate. Mr. Lane stated that ODOT did not release
the actual bid from the selected consultant, but it was probably close to the lowest bid of $252,784.
Engineer Gills said it did not make sense for the sponsor to go out for bid knowing the estimate
was high and they did not have the money. He said the sponsor should have asked for the money
first and then go out for bid.
Mayor Hunter said the project needs to move ahead and funding has been set aside for both
phases. He suggested that the sponsor talk to their engineer to find out why the bid missed by
$100,000 (40%). He stated that if Phase II is presented to the Committee for funding, he will take
a strong look at it to make sure the figures are in line. He said he did not like the idea of a sponsor
moving ahead with a project before getting approval.
Ms. Gallucci stated that staff spent a significant amount of time working with the City of North
Royalton on this project. She noted that the city reviewed the local estimate as well as ODOT
Central’s estimate. She mentioned that ODOT Central used a number of cost indicators that were
very different than what the city used to ensure that the facility would be built to a higher standard.
Ms. Gallucci mentioned that Mayor Robert Stefanik contacted NOACA early on when it appeared
there could be a problem with the project. At that time, NOACA worked with ODOT Central and
District 12 to resolve any issues. Ms. Gallucci stated that North Royalton is aware that if the
NOACA Board does not approve the request, the city will have to pay for the project with local
funds. She said North Royalton has not committed any funding from NOACA and is aware of the
risks.
Engineer Gills stated that anyone who asks for federal funds knows they have to build the project
to federal standards, which is more expensive. He said the sponsor should have reflected their
estimates accordingly when applying for TLCI funds. He noted that sponsors have been
submitting estimates to NOACA for years that have been ridiculously low.
Engineer Gills stated that the sponsor should not be allowed to transfer funds from Phase II to
Phase I and NOACA should not allow the sponsor to come back later and ask for more money.
Mr. Lane mentioned that the project received a TLCI award in 2017. Since that time, NOACA has
revised the TLCI procedures and requires that a stamped line item estimate from a professional
engineer be attached to every TLCI application. Mr. Lane mentioned that NOACA staff has been
working with the communities to get better estimates.

8234c

1-5

 Ms. Gallucci mentioned that the sponsor received an award for both phases. She said the
sponsor knows Phase II will not automatically receive more funds.
The Committee voted and Engineer Gills and Commissioner Dvorak voted no. The motion
passed by voice vote.
Reports / Updates
The financial report and the Capital Programs Performance Measures Report were included in
the meeting packet.
Old Business
Ms. Gallucci acknowledged the Finance and Audit Committee for its work and for recommending
that NOACA take a stronger position on the gas tax issue. She mentioned that the resolution
approved by the Board was sent to the state.
Ms. Gallucci talked about counties and municipalities in the region not getting their fair share of
funding. She stated that NOACA staff will continue to testify before the state legislature on the
funding needed for this region and the inequitable distribution of the current formulas.
New Business
No new business was discussed at this meeting.
Adjournment
Mayor Ritenauer stated that the next Finance and Audit Committee meeting will be held at the
NOACA offices on August 9, 2019 at 8:30 a.m. There being no further business, the meeting was
adjourned at 9:45 a.m.

FROM:

Grace Gallucci, Executive Director

DATE:

August 16, 2019

RE:

NOACA SFY 2021 – 2024 Draft Transportation Improvement Program
Financials

ACTION REQUESTED
The Finance and Audit Committee is asked to consider recommending this item to the
Executive Committee as a component of the SFY 2021-2024 Draft Transportation Improvement
Program (TIP) for placement on the Board of Directors’ September 2019 agenda. Specifically, it
would approve the financial plan for NOACA funded projects for the SFY 2021-2024 Draft TIP.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION
NOACA is developing its TIP for state fiscal years (SFYs) 2021 - 2024, which will be in effect
from July 1, 2020 through June 30, 2024. The TIP will contain road, bridge, public transit, and
other transportation projects scheduled for implementation within NOACA’s five counties.
The TIP will include projects supported by federal funds controlled through ODOT and the
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) or by other governmental agencies.
The TIP will also include projects to be funded with NOACA Surface Transportation Block Grant
(STBG) funds, Transportation Alternatives Program (TAP) funds and also the sub-allocated
Congestion Mitigation Air Quality (CMAQ) funds for SFYs 2021 through 2024.
Attached are tables summarizing the respective NOACA funding budgets, the current NOACA
funding commitments and the recommended NOACA funding commitments for SFYs 2021 –
2024.
Each NOACA funding program summary shows the total available budget for each state fiscal
year. The total available budget includes an estimated growth of 2% per year as received
through the FAST Act and 10% additional funding estimated to be available due to project bids
coming in under the estimated cost and project cancellations.
Each table also contains sub-totals for the projects or initiatives programmed for each SFY
(tables are shown in Attachment 1). Those projects and initiatives include:
•
•

Existing STBG, TAP, and CMAQ projects in the SFY 2018 - 2021 TIP;
Existing debt service for projects approved for State Infrastructure Bank (SIB) financing;
4-1

 •
•
•

New projects recommended for NOACA STBG, TAP, and CMAQ funding
(recommended for approval by the Planning and Programming Committee at its July 12,
2019 meeting);
Transportation for Livable Communities Initiative for SFYs 2021 through 2024; and
Debt service for two projects recommended for SIB or other innovative financing:
o
o

CUY ROCKSIDE RD BRIDGES, Cuyahoga County Dept. of Public Works
CUY THRIVE 105 (CUY E. 93rd St. and E. 105th St. Improvements)

As a result of concern over excessive reliance on SIB financing as a method of project
financing, the Board approved a policy that limits total debt service to no more than 50% of
annual capital program allocations. The percentage of the annual STBG program allocation
committed to debt service in the SFY 2018 - 2021 TIP will peak at 34% in SFY 2020 and remain
below that level throughout the SFY 2021-2024 TIP.
Additional funding may become available after TIP approval as a result of positive true-up of
program budgets by ODOT, or when existing projects are delayed, completed below budget, or
adjusted for actual realized material and/or labor quantities.
In accordance with the Board approved approach to the expenditure of new funding that
becomes available for the TIP, funding would be prioritized in accordance with one, or a
combination, of the following approaches:
1.
2.
3.
4.

Reduce planned debt requirements
Advance future TIP project(s)
Reserve for potential project cost increases
Fund new projects from the long-range transportation plan

The projects recommended for NOACA funding were recommended for approval by the
Planning and Programming Committee at its July 12, 2019 meeting. These NOACA project
funding recommendations will be presented to the Executive Committee at its August 16, 2019
meeting and, with their concurrence, will be presented to the NOACA Board of Directors at its
September 13, 2019 meeting for approval.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact at this time.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Upon Board approval, staff will work with project sponsors to finalize project scope, schedule
and budget for incorporation into the draft SFY 2021-2024 TIP, along with non-NOACA funded
projects. The final draft SFY 2021-2024 TIP will be presented to the Planning and Programming
Committee for recommendation at its January 17, 2020 meeting and to the Board of Directors at
its March 13, 2020 meeting for approval.

NOACA Finance and Audit Committee

FROM:

Grace Gallucci, Executive Director

DATE:

August 16, 2019

RE:

State Fiscal Year 2019 Overall Work Program Completion Report

ACTION REQUESTED
The Committee is asked to consider recommending this item to the Executive Committee for placement
on the Board of Directors’ September 2019 agenda. Specifically, this item approves NOACA’s State
Fiscal Year (SFY) 2019 Overall Work Program (OWP) Completion Report. The activities outlined in
this work program occurred between July 1, 2018 and June 30, 2019. ODOT requires a Boardapproved Completion Report by September 30, 2019.
BACKGROUND
NOACA’s many accomplishments during SFY 2019 were achieved through the leadership of its Board of
Directors, the dedication of its Committees, and the contributions of staff.
Federal law requires that metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) develop a unified planning work
program each year that describes all federal-aid planning activities. In Ohio this work program is called
the Overall Work Program (OWP). NOACA develops its OWP consistent with federal and state
transportation and environmental planning guidance.
The completion report outlines staff activities as outlined in the SFY 2019 Overall Work Program (OWP).
It also includes a year-end funding table. The report was prepared for NOACA funding agencies, the
Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT).
The SFY 2019 OWP comprises 31 projects comprising 114 individual work products. NOACA spent 83
percent of funding in SFY 2019 to achieve an average project completion rate of 97 percent. Unspent
Consolidated Planning Grant funds have been carried forward into the current fiscal year. A detailed
project level table is attached.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with this document.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Pending Board approval, the 2019 OWP Completion Report will be forwarded to state and federal officials
for review.

MEMORANDUM
TO:

NOACA Finance and Audit Committee

FROM:

Grace Gallucci, Executive Director

DATE:

August 16, 2019

RE:

Budget and Contract Amendment – Great Lakes Hyperloop Feasibility Study

ACTION REQUESTED
The Committee is asked to consider recommending this item to the Executive Committee for placement on
the Board of Directors’ September agenda. Specifically, this action would amend the total project budget
from $650,000 to $750,000, and amend the Transportation Economics & Management Systems, Inc.
(TEMS) contract for The Great Lakes Hyperloop Feasibility Study in the amount of $84,600.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION FOR CURRENT ACTION
The Board of Directors, through Resolution 2018-019, authorized a budget of $600,000 and awarded a
contract to Transportation Economics & Management Systems, Inc. (TEMS) for the development of The
Great Lakes Hyperloop Feasibility Study. The Board of Directors also, through Resolution 2019-028,
increased the contract to TEMS from $550,092 to $585,485 for the extension of the corridor from
Youngstown to Pittsburgh. Since the last Board meeting, The Richard King Mellon Foundation has granted
NOACA $100,000 for further analysis of the Cleveland to Chicago and Pittsburgh corridor, which includes
the analysis of an additional representative route to the Pittsburgh airport, station analyses in Cleveland,
Chicago and Pittsburgh, modal split refinement, and project meetings.
A time extension to December 31, 2019 is needed to complete the additional work and outreach efforts.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
This project was budgeted for expenditure in FY 2019 for $650,000 and is funded through revenues now
totaling $750,000 earmarked for the Hyperloop initiative from various partners of NOACA (Cleveland
Foundation - $200k, ODOT - $250,000, Ohio Turnpike - $100,000), the RK Mellon Foundation - $100,000, as
well as NOACA ($100K). This action would increase the consultant contract from $585,485 to $670,085, and
the total project budget from $650,000 to $750,000.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Pending Board approval, NOACA will amend the budget, OWP and the contract with Transportation
Economics & Management Systems, Inc. (TEMS).
