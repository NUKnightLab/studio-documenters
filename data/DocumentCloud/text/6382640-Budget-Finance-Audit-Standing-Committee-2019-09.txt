NEW BUSINESS
LAW DEPARTMENT
20.
Submitting report relative to Supplemental Opinion on Special Assessments. (There is no
legal support for an ordinance that would extract individual parcels located within a
special assessment district that receive the benefit of the service or improvement that
is the premise of that special assessment district from that particular levy. The
foundation of a special assessment district is that all of the parcels within that district
receive a benefit from the special assessment levy that is distinguishable from general
property taxes or a municipality-wide special assessment so that those parcels within
the district are responsible for the levy wile property outside of that district are not.
The cost of the benefit is apportioned to every property in the district based on the
value of the improvement (or service) to that property. In fact, most properties
exempt from ad valorem or general property taxes are specifically not exempt from a
special assessment levy, this includes certain government property.) (REFERRED TO

including: Flint, Michigan; Memphis, Tennessee; Louisville, Kentucky; Grand
Rapids, Michigan; Boston, Massachusetts; Portland, Oregon; Charlotte, North
