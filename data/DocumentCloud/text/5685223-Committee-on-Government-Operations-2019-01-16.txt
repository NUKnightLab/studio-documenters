Engagement strategy mUSt be in place before succession can be implemented. We are pleased to
advise, that we are well underway with these priorities, including a succession strategy. Asia
reminder, We previously communicated the target for implementation was TBD 2019, which still
seems realistic, but most likely Q3 2019.

The following represents the sea uenice and status of the Empiovee Engagementgiocus;

1. Communication/Intakes and Needs Assessments Are in process and continue

2. Employee Training Live and eLearning trainings have been implemented, enterprisenwide,
and continue. [These trainings have primarilvI focused on Professional Standards, Sexual
Harassment and Bridging the Supervisor Gap).

3. A partnership with SkillSoft, a cloud-based eLearning provider of 24?7 ran-demand learning,
was implemented, configured and launched, on a limited basis, July 11th, 2018. Course
catalogs were developed and have been put in place. Some targeted training has occurred
and we contlnue to work on our overall delivery and full-scale implementation moving
forward. 

4. A partnership with Wayne State has been implemented and the custom leadership
development training is being constructed. Training should begin in February 2019.

5. We have short?listed three possible application suppliers for ?Performance, coaching and
Goal Setting, which have succession functionality?. Procurement will start once comparable
sources have final pricing.

A THREE-YEAR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT WITH THE AND
NUTRITIONISTS ASSOCIATION 
(2019-43004)

CONTENT

The Department of PersonnelIHuman Resources? Division of Labor Relations is requesting

Commission approval of a three-year collective bargaining agreement (CBA) with the Dietitians
and Nutritionists Association.

The term of the CBA is from October 1, 2018 through September 30, 2021. The term of the
previous CBA was from October 1, 2015 through September 30, 2018.

The new CBA was signed by Dietitians and Nutritionists Association President Peggy
Hennigan and Vice President Rachel West on October 12, 2018, and by Joseph Martinico, the
County?s Director of Labor Relations, on October 23, 2018.

The five?member bargaining unit represents the classifications of Dietitian, Public Health
Nutrition Consultant, Special Duty Nutritionist, Community Nutritionist Assistant and Special
Duty Community Nutritionist Assistant. All five are Dietitians.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES FROM THE PREVIOUS CBA

oArticle 6 deals with payment of association dues. Article 6.05 says: ?The provisions of
this Article shall be interpreted and enforced consistent with PA 349 of 2012, and with the
decision of the United States Supreme Court in Janus v. AFSCME, decided June 27, 2018."
The provision for Public Act 349, which helped to establish Michigan as a ?right to work? state,
carries over from the previous CBA. lt permits employees to withdraw from a union, but keep
their jobs. The Janus v. AFSCME portion which essentially says the same thing as Public
Act 349, but on a national level -- was added

oArticles 34.02 and 34.03 now say that employees shall receive 2 percent raises on
October 1, 2018 and April 1, 2020. Under the previous CBA, employees received a 1.5 percent
raise for each of the three years. .

oArticles 34.08 and 34.10 say that employees? wages shall not be tied in any way to the
wages of other bargaining units. The language is very similar between the sections. A similar
provision was Article 34.09 in the previous CBA.

oArticle 34.09 in the new CBA was added to say that employees who are classified as a
Public Health Nutrition Consultant and are required to function in the capacity of Team Leader

Page 1 of 4

 

 

will receive an additional $1.50 per hour. It replaces Memorandum of Agreement No. 5, which
was deleted. The previous No. 5 gave Team Leaders an extra $1.25 per hour.

oArticle 46, the Successor Clause, was deleted. It said that the agreement shall be
binding upon the County's successor, assignees or transferees in the event of the County's
merger or consolidation.

oAlticle 4? establishes the effective dates as October 1, 2018 through
September 30, 2021.

oMemorandum of Agreement No. 1 establishes that employees who are required to use
their private vehicles while working shall be reimbursed for actual trip mileage according to the

standard rate established by the IRS. lt supersedes Article 33.01, which essentially used 
rates.

RETROACTIVITY

Section 120-50 of the Procurement Ordinance, which prohibits premature performance and

payment on contracts, does not apply to collective bargaining agreements, per Section 120-
50(i).

BACKGROUND

The tentative draft of the previous CBA with the Dietitians and Nutritionists Association was

The executed CBA with the Dietitians and Nutritionists Association was reviewed by the
Committee of the Whole and approved with Commission Resolution No. 2016-352 on July 
2016. The vote on this item was as follows:
Yea Commissioners Anderson, Barone, Clark?Coleman, Haidous, Killeen, Leland,
Marecki, Palamara, Scott, Varga, Webb, Vice~Chair Pro Tempore Ware, Vice?
Chair Bell, Chairman Woronchak -- 14
Nay -- Commissioner Basham -- 1

A memorandum of agreement to modify the CBA with the Dietitians and Nutritionists
Association requiring that a high-deductible health plan be offered through a health
maintenance organization (instead of just through a preferred provider organization) was
reviewed by the Committee of the Whole and approved with Commission Resolution No. 2016-
358 on July 7, 2016. The vote on this item was as follows:
Yea -- Commissioners Anderson, Barone, Clark-Coleman, Haidous, Killeen, Leland,
Marecki, Palamara, Scott, Varga, Webb, Vice?Chair Pro Tempore Ware, Vice?
Chair Bell, Chairman Woronchak 14
Nay -- Commissioner Basham -- 1

PRELIMINARY CONCERNS

Why was this agreement not submitted to the Commission before the start date,
October 1, 2018? 

RESPONSE: The CBA was tentatively agreed-upon on September 19, 2018. The Union
membership ratified the contract on or about September 20, 2018. Thereafter, a final draft of
the CBA, incorporating the changes negotiated, was compiled and forward to the Union for
review. After some delay, the Union returned the CBA with signatures on October 20, 2018.
The Wayne County Director of Labor Relations signed on October 23, 2018. The CBA, along

with supporting documentation, was then entered into TCM (SciQuest) the very next day, on
October 24, 2018.

On October 31, 2018, the CBA was returned back to Labor Relations by Wayne County's
Department of Management and Budget regarding mileage rate and requiring proof of driver's

insurance. Once this was remedied and the CBA was amended, it was re?entered into TCM on
November 8, 2018.

How many employees are in each classification, as defined in Article 3.02 of the 
RESPONSE: Public Health Nutrition Consultant: 5. Dietitian: 0. Special Duty Nutritionist: 0.
Special Duty Community Nutrition Assistant: 0. Community Nutritionist Assistant: 0.

This CBA deletes Memorandum of Agreement No. 5. Please provide all of the
Memorandums of Agreement that were under the previous CBA. They are not in the
Commission?s records of the previous tentative draft (2015-47-012) or executed CBA
(2016-45-008).

RESPONSE: (Staff note: They have been provided.)

Page 3 of 4

 

Articles 34.08 and 34.10 are the same except for two words -- ?whatsoever? in 34.08, and
?anyway? in 34.08 and ?any way? in 34.10. Please explain the differences.
RESPONSE: There is no substantive difference between these two sections. 

Article 47.03 says that the agreement shall continue after September 30, 2018 place, which is the end date of the previous CBA. Should this date be
September 30, 2021? Please explain.

RESPONSE: Yes, this date should be September 30, 2021 and will be revised to reflect the
correct date.

In SciQuest, the starting date is January 1, 1900, which is used to signify that an

agreement is to start upon Commission approval. However, the CBA has a start date of
October 1, 2018. Please explain.

RESPONSE: The October 1, 2018 start date is only effective upon Commission approval.

Are any-other unions working under expired If so, which ones?

Four proposals -- from HMSA, WorkLife Solutions, Henry Ford Health System and
Ulliance, Inc. were received in response to 181 solicitations.

WorkLife Solutions and Henry Ford Health System were deemed as nonresponsive

The four-member Evaluation Committee scored the two remaining respondents on a 100~point

scale, with an average of 94.15 awarded to HIVISA and an average of 73.85 awarded to
Ulliance.

Grosse Pointe Woods and Harper Woods, and the Village of Grosse Pointe Shores?A

Michigan City. The other three cities Eastpointe, Roseville and St. Clair Shores -- are in

ETHICS DISCLOSUREINEED FOR COMMISSION SUPER MAJORITY APPROVAL
Submission of an Ethics in Contracting Vendor Form, also known as an Ethics Certification, is
required under Section 120?225 of the Procurement Ordinance. The form for this modification,
signed by firm shareholder Michael Caldwell, disclosed that Deputy County Executive Richard
Kaufman has a "substantial financial interest? in Zausmer, August Caldwell, PC in response
to the question, ?Do you and a contract manager each have a substantial financial interest in
one or more of the same business ventures??

The form for another Zausmer, August 8 Caldwell, PC contract (2018-40-151) that was before
the Commission, but has since been withdrawn at the request of the Office of Corporation
Counsel, contains the same disclosure. It was signed by firm shareholder Gary August.

When these two items were originally submitted to the Commission, Mr. Caldwell made the
disclosure on his form, but Mr. August answered ?no? to the question. Both items were
returned to the Office of Corporation Counsel to address several issues, including this.

Because of this disclosure, Section 120?225(0) of the Procurement Ordinance requires that
any contract with Zausmer, August Caldwell, PC requires approval by a super majority or
at least 10 members of the full Commission.

Section 120?225(0) of the Procurement Ordinance reads, shared business venture exists
when the principal beneficiary and a county employee who is on the contract managers list
each currently have a substantial financial interest in one or more of the same business
ventures. If a shared business venture exists, then the contract shall be submitted for approval

Page 2 of 8

 

of the County Commission, and it shall require the vote of at least ten commissioners to
approve that contract."

Section 120-238(i) of the Procurement Ordinance defines ?substantial financial interest.? An
abbreviated version is listed on the form as:

?Ownership of any interest or involvement in any relationship, which results in the
receipt of $500 or more per year. Exceptions: Market-rate from a financial institution; income
from ownership of less than $10,000 of stocks and bonds traded on the national stock
exchanges.? -

?Holding a key position in a business such as officer, director, trustee, partner or sales

manager. Exceptions: Officers who serve without compensation on the boards of charitable
organizations.?

Kaufman disclosed a "substantial financial interest? in Zausmer, August Caldwell, PC on
his Conflict of Interest forms for 2015-18.

ADDITIONAL ETHICS DISCLOSURE
lVlr. Kaufman?s son, Sean, is a clerk for Zausmer, August Caldwell. This disclosure has been

made to the Commission by the firm several times, and Mr. Kaufman disclosed his son?s
employment on his Conflict of Interest forms.

RETROACTIVITY

The modification is deemed retroactive, per Section 120-50(a) of the Procurement Ordinance

because what has been spent and a pending invoice combined are greater than $85,000, the
contract's value.

Section 120-50 states, when Commission approval is required, no person can authorize
performance or payment on a contract prior to approval by the Commission and execution by
the County Executive. Any person who authorizes premature performance and/or payment
may suffer penalties if damages were incurred as a result of the premature performance. This
may result in civil action and the person who violates the ordinance shall be personally liable,
with liability not exceeding $500 per violation.

Additionally, Section 120-50(d) states any person or business that provides services prior to
approval does so at their own risk. They could be disbarred from receiving County contracts
and must hold the County harmless against actual damages, costs, expenses and liability of
any kind that the County sustains, incurs or is required to pay arising out of him, her or it
rendering performance contrary to this Section.

Lastly, a resolution has been proposed that recognizes this contract is in violation of Ordinance
No. 2006-1101 (as amended) and Section 5.143 of the Home Rule Charter for the County of
Wayne, and directs the County Executive, in conjunction with Corporation Counsel, to submit a
report to the Commission on this matter within 90 days.

PRELIMINARY CONCERNS
(Staff note: The answers were provided in early December 2018.)

How much money has been spent on this contract?
RESPONSE: $78,162.00

Are there any outstanding invoices? If so, what is the total?
RESPONSE: One outstanding invoice #101054 for $10,848.50

What work remains for Zausmer, August Caldwell to perform in this matter, and when
does the Office of Corporation Counsel anticipate that the firm?s work will be finished?
RESPONSE: Transfer of appropriate software license for SCADA, the transfer and review of
hard copy records that need to be completed prior to January, minor issues regarding the
Transition Services Agreement. It is believed and hoped that there will be no outstanding
issues by January 1, 2019.

(Staff note: SCADA stands for Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition, and it?s for the
computers associated with operations.)

The Ethics in Contracting Vendor Form discloses that Deputy County Executive Richard
Kaufman has a ?substantial financial interest,? as defined in Section 120-238(i) of the
Procurement Ordinance, in Zausmer, August Caldwell, PC. Please define exactly what
Mr. Kaufman?s ?substantial financial interest? is in Zausmer, August Caldwell, PC.
And, when did his ?substantial financial interest? in the firm resume?

RESPONSE: Richard Kaufman disclosed a ?substantial financial interest? in Zausmer, August
Caldwell, PC on his Conflicts of Interest forms for 2015 through 2018. While still a
shareholder at the firm lVlr. Kaufman worked on a matter which resulted in a contingency fee
being paid to the firm well after his departure. Mr. Kaufman received a portion of the firm?s fee
based upon the work he had completed on the file while still a shareholder. He received his
portion of this contingency fee in 2018. He answered the ?substantial financial interest?
consistently in anticipation that there may be a time when the case in question would settle
and payment be owed. Mr. Kaufman has not established a new interest in the firm since his
departure, and there are no additional matters which may produce a fee to which he is entitled.

Commission staff asked in February 2017 if Mr. Kaufman still had a ?substantial
financial interest? in the firm, in which he was a shareholder before becoming Assistant
County Executive. The Office of Corporation Counsel answered that, ?Mr. Kaufman no
longer has a ?substantial financial interest? in the firm as of August 1, 2016.? Did Mr.
Kaufman have a ?substantial financial interest? in Zausmer, August 8. Caldwell, PC at
any time between August 1, 2016 and when it resumed (see previous question)? If so,
please specifically define that ?substantial financial interest," including the time period.

RESPONSE: Mr. Kaufman correctly accounted for the potential future payment on his Conflict
of Interest forms for 2015-2018 even though the exact date and amount of the payment were
not known at the time. However, the conclusion of the legal matter and the associated
payment were anticipated prior to 2017. Since the definition of ?substantial financial interest? in
the ordinance contemplates future and not simply present entitlements, the potential for this
payment should have been addressed in Corporation Counsel?s February 2017 response.

However, the response referred specifically to Mr. Kaufman having divested his ownership
interest in the firm, which he did prior to his appointment as Deputy County Executive. 
Kaufman has not established a new interest in the firm since his departure.
