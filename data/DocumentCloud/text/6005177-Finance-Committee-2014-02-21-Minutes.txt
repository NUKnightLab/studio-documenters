III. Action Items
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)
With regard to request number 1, additional information was requested for this request and for future grantrelated requests. Board Chairman Carvalho stated that the Board needs to be provided with information that
indicates whether the grant –related services are mandated or optional, and whether the grant funding covers
the cost of the provision of those services1.
During the discussion, Dr. Mason offered to provide a presentation in the future that gives a broader overview
of grants. Board Chairman Carvalho stated that one of the things that Board Members need to be assured of is
grant compliance and whether grants are properly managed; he stated that the assurances on how the System
manages that should be part of the presentation2.
During the discussion of request number 2, Mr. Johnston provided additional information. He stated that the
request may be misclassified – this may need to instead be a request to execute contracts with the thirty-four
municipalities, rather than renew intergovernmental agreements with the thirty-four municipalities. He stated
that he will further review the matter3; if a change is needed, the request can be corrected prior to the Board
Meeting on February 28th.
Also with regard to request number 2, Board Chairman Carvalho inquired whether the inspection fee charged
by CCDPH covers the cost of the inspections performed by CCDPH staff4.
Director Hammock, seconded by Director Gugenheim, moved the approval of request
numbers 1 through 7. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

C. Any items listed under Sections III and IV

IV. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
A. Update on Section 1115 Medicaid Waiver Demonstration Project/CountyCare
Steven Glass, Executive Director of Managed Care, provided an update on the Section 1115 Medicaid Waiver
Demonstration Project/CountyCare. He stated that CountyCare continues to operate under a temporary
extension of its 1115 Waiver; significant accomplishments in enrollment and membership have been achieved
again this month.
In February, it is anticipated that an additional 7,200 CountyCare applications will be initiated; this will bring
the total number of applications initiated to just over 141,000. Another 6,800 applications have been submitted
to the State’s Department of Human Services (DHS) this month for processing; this brings the total number of
applications submitted to DHS to 113,000.
At the end of this month, the administration expects that the State will approve another 4,300 applications,
which would bring the total number of approved applicants to just over 81,000.
Over the past six months, equilibrium has been reached between the number of applications submitted to DHS
and the number they approve. As a result, the back-log of applications at DHS continues to hover around
18,000, or 2 1/2 months’ worth of submissions.

IV. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
A. Update on Section 1115 Medicaid Waiver Demonstration Project/CountyCare (continued)
All other trends in the program continue as they have in prior months, in terms of where applications originate
and where members are assigned.
The administration will continue to work through the RFP process in the selection of a new third party
administrator, as well as negotiate the managed care contract with the State of Illinois. It is hoped that the
administration will bring both of these matters to the Board for review next week and next month.
Board Chairman Carvalho noted that the System continues to operate CountyCare under an extension of the
authority that it operated under in calendar year 2013; he requested that Mr. Glass provide a status update on
that extension and an update on what is supposed to come after that. Mr. Glass stated that the temporary
extension of the Waiver was granted by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) on December
31st. In that notice, they provided for a ninety day extension through March 31st; he added that, in the cover
letter, there was a one sentence comment indicating that an additional ninety days may be requested. The State
of Illinois, who is the actual holder of the Waiver, in its response acknowledging the extension, asked for that
additional ninety days, and asked for a timely response from CMS.
Mr. Glass stated that the State has not yet heard back from CMS regarding the request for the additional ninety
days. The administration is operating, staff-wise, under the assumption that the Waiver will expire March 31st,
and that the System therefore needs to enter into a contract with the State of Illinois to become a Managed Care
Community Network (MCCN). Mr. Glass stated that the administration received a draft MCCN agreement
back from the State of Illinois that members of staff are reviewing; a full day meeting has been scheduled in a
couple of weeks down in Springfield to go page-by-page to review it. He hopes that the agreement will be
finalized in a couple of weeks.
Mr. Glass provided an overview of the relationship with Access to Care, in relation to CountyCare. In response
to Director Gugenheim’s question regarding the number of Access to Care patients that have been found to be
eligible to enroll in CountyCare, Mr. Glass stated that he can get that information5.

V.
