STAFF REPORT 8-14-2019 MEETING
APPLICATION NUMBER 19-6372
ADDRESS: 120 SEWARD
APPLICANT: JOE PALANDINO
HISTORIC DISTRICT: NEW CENTER

PREPARED BY: J. ROSS

PROPOSAL
Erected in 1923, the building located at 120 Seward is known as the Grandmont Manor Apartments. Hugh
T. Miller served as the project architect. The building is four stories in height and displays buff brick
exterior walls with stone detailing at the garden level, door surrounds, and window sills. All existing
windows were added in 1985/are not original. Windows located at the primary elevations are aluminum
casement (most with decorative multiple-light muntins) and aluminum double-hung units (8/1). The
grids/muntins have been glued to the exterior glass surface. The aluminum window trim dates from the
1985 window replacement project. Please see the attached drawing, which depicts the details for the
aluminum window panning/trim/brickmould. The courtyard displays 1/1 aluminum sash unit and
glassblock windows at the basement level. Fixed aluminum windows with metal panel inserts are at the
rear elevation. The applicant has noted that the current windows at his condo are in poor condition,
resulting in the need to screw some of the units shut.
The building houses condo units. With the current proposal, the applicant is seeking to replace 19 windows
at Unit # 211 as per the attached schedule. Specifically, the project proposes the following scope of work:
•

•

•

Unit # 211,
location of
condo proposed
for window
replacement

Replace five, 8/1 double-hung, aluminum windows with five new 8/1, wood, double-hung
aluminum-clad window sash (inserts) with mesh screens. The new windows will display a
“Bahama Brown” finish color, while the screens will be “Charcoal Fiberglass.” The existing
aluminum panning/trim/brickmould will be retained.
Replace two, 8/1 double-hung, aluminum windows with two new 6/1, wood, double-hung
aluminum-clad window sash (inserts) with mesh screens. The new windows will display a
“Bahama Brown” finish color, while the screens will be “Charcoal Fiberglass.” The existing
aluminum panning/trim/brickmould will be retained.
At the breakfast nook/front bay bumpout, remove 12 casement windows (3 sets of paired
aluminum casement windows and 6 individual casement windows) with stick on grids/muntins
and install 12 new undivided lite wood, aluminum-clad casement windows (3 sets of paired
aluminum casement windows and 6 individual casement windows) with mesh screens. The new
windows display “Hampton Sage” finish color at the aluminum cladding, while the screens will
be “Charcoal Fiberglass” colored. The applicant has stated that the existing aluminum
panning/trim/brickmould will be retained.

 Designation Slide, dating from 1982. Note original wood windows include 81/ double hung units and Art Deco style,
multiple-light casement windows

Current conditions. Aluminum replacement windows added in 1985. Note, casement window muntin pattern mirrors the
original light configuration.

 STAFF OBSERVATIONS
As noted in the above narrative, the current windows at the property were installed in 1985. These
windows are aluminum, with aluminum trim and adheared muntins. Please see the attached drawing
which provides detail re: the current trim profile. The windows are in poor condition and the stick on
muntins appear to be failing/falling off throughout. The applicant therefore seeks to replace the
windows at his unit with new wood, aluminum-clad windows. The applicant has further noted that
the other residents within the building hope to utilize the proposed specifications for all future window
replacements to ensure that all windows are eventually uniform in material, operation, and detailing.
Note that the new double-hung units will display a light configuration that is similar to the original
and existing double-hung sash (8/1), with the exception of the 2 new double-hung windows proposed
for the Living Room, which will display a 6/1 light configuration. Also, each of the new/proposed
casement windows will display a full, undivided light vision panel (vs the current multiple lite grid
pattern present at the current casement windows that are proposed for replacement). As per the below
photos, the light configuration of the current casement windows (installed in 1985) was based upon
the building’s original windows.

Original/historic windows (designation slide)

Existing replacement windows. Note,
adheadred muntins replicate historic

The applicant has noted that he was unable to find a manufacturer who could replicate the grid pattern
of the original/current casement windows. It is staff’s opinion that the new casement windows should
reflect a muntin pattern that is consistent with the original and current casement units.
While staff does have the dimension of the proposed new windows, the current application does not
provide dimensions around the current/existing windows, ie. the size re: the current frame/casing,
sash face, inside opening, etc. Staff therefore cannot definitively understand if the amount of glass
visible and size of the window frame of the new windows will be consistent with the existing. Note
that the applicant (owner of Unit # 211) has stated that he intends to retain the existing non-historic
aluminum trim. The double-hung windows proposed for installation have been identified as “inserts”,
which seems to allow for the trim to be retained for those units. However, it is unclear if the 3 new
sets of paired casement windows will allow for the existing center mullion at each window opening,
as outlined in the below photo, to be retained.

Finally, please note that the new windows will include dark integral screens, which will have a visual
impact on the windows. Staff did view a digital image of a Marvin Window with integrated screen,
but the true visual impact was not discernable. Staff has therefore requested that the applicant bring
a window sample to the meeting for the Commission’s review.
APPLICABLE ELEMENTS OF DESIGN
(2)
Proportion of buildings front facades. Proportion varies in the district, depending on use,
style, and size of buildings. While single family dwellings may appear taller than wide or
wider than tall, the overall appearance is neutral. Terraces or rowhouse buildings are wider
than tall; apartment buildings appear taller than wide although some are wider than tall due
to projecting and receding wall surfaces that emphasize the vertical.
(3)

Proportion of openings within the facades. Areas of voids generally constitute between
fifteen (15) per cent and thirty-five (35) per cent of the front facade, excluding the roof. Most
window openings are taller than wide, but are frequently grouped into combinations wider
than tall. Where there are transom windows above doors they are wider than tall; a few round
windows exist on upper stories or attics. A great variety of sizes, shapes, and groupings of
openings exist in the district.

(4)

Rhythm of solids to voids in front facades. Queen Anne and arts-and-crafts style buildings
display freedom in the arrangement of openings within the facades, but usually result in a
balanced composition. In buildings derived from classical precedents, voids are usually
arranged in a symmetrical and evenly spaced manner within the facade.

 (5)

(7)

Rhythm of spacing of buildings on streets. The spacing of buildings has generally been
determined by the setback from the side lot lines. The spacing of buildings tends to be
consistent, except where vacant lots occur. On Virginia Park where lots are approximately
fifty (50) feet wide, some buildings are placed closer to one side lot line, creating room for a
side driveway. On smaller lots in the district, the buildings occupy most of the width of their
lots, while complying with the side lot setback restrictions.
Relationship of materials. The district exhibits a wide variety of building materials
characteristic of single and multiple unit residential buildings dating from the last decade of
the nineteenth century and first quarter of the twentieth century. The majority of buildings
are faced with brick; a brick veneer first story and a stucco, clapboard, or wood shingle second
story is not unusual. All-stone, all-stucco, and all-wood buildings exist but are few in number.
Later replacement siding is uncommon in the district; when it does exist, much of side
changes the original visual relationship of the siding to the building. Stone sills and wood
trim are common. Roofing includes slate, tile, and asphalt shingles. It is common for
apartment buildings to have limestone or concrete high basements or first stories and stone
ornamental detail and trim.

(8)

Relationship of textures. The most common relationship of textures in the district is that of
the low-relief pattern of mortar joints in brick contrasted to the smooth surface of wood trim
and masonry sills. The brick is sometimes textured. Also common is the contrast in textures
created by the juxtaposition of different materials used for the first and second stories;
frequently a brick first story is contrasted with a stucco or wood sheathed second story. Halftimbering adds textural interest to the stucco where it exists on neo-Tudor houses. In
apartment buildings, stone, either rough cut or smooth and/or cut to appear like rustification
at the basement and/or first story level contrasts with the main material, brick. Slate and tile
roofs contribute to the textural interest, whereas asphalt shingles generally do not.

(9)

Relationship of colors. Paint colors generally relate to style. Natural brick colors (red, brown,
yellow, orange, buff) predominate in wall surfaces. Natural stone colors also exist. Stucco
and concrete are usually left in their natural state or are painted in a shade of mm; halftimbering is frequently stained or painted brown or brownish-red. Classically inspired
buildings, particularly neo-Georgian and colonial revival, frequently have wood trim painted
white, cream, or in a range of these colors. Where shutters exist, they are either dark green,
black, or another appropriate dark color. Colors known to have been in use on buildings of
this type in the eighteenth or nineteenth centuries on similar buildings may be considered for
suitability. Buildings of medieval and/or arts-and-crafts inspiration generally have painted
wood trim of dark brown; black and red is also present. Queen Anne and late Victorian style
houses may have several colors painted on the same facade. Storm windows are sometimes
a different color from the window frames and sash; window sash are most often the same
color as the window frames, with a few exceptions. Colors used on trim of apartment
buildings are frequently brown, gray, black or green. The original color scheme of any
building, as determined by professional analysis, is always acceptable for the building, and
may provide suggestions for similar buildings. Roofs are in natural colors; slate is predominantly gray, gray green and black; tile is green or red. Asphalt shingles display a variety of
colors, most derived from colors of natural materials (tile, slate and wood colors).

RECOMMENDATION
As noted above, the existing windows proposed for replacement are not historic age as they were replaced in
1985. However, the light configuration of the windows, the operation of the windows, and the existing trim
profile and detailing do appear to closely match the original historic windows. It is staff’s opinion that the new
windows proposed for installation generally match the existing/old, as they will display the same operation
and material. Staff therefore recommends that the Commission issues a Certificate of Appropriateness for the
replacement of windows at 120 Seward because it meets the Secretary of the interior Standards for

 Rehabilitation, standard number 6). Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced.
Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match
the old in design, color, texture, and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement of
missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or pictorial evidence.

However, staff does recommend that this approval be issued with the following conditions:
• The existing casement windows shall be replaced with new aluminum or wood, aluminum-clad
casement windows of the similar dimensions and profile. The applicant shall provide
corresponding dimension details of the existing and proposed new windows to staff for review
and approval prior to the issuance of the COA so that staff can determine if the new windows
closely match the existing. Should staff determine that the new windows do not adequately match
the existing, staff shall forward the project to the Commission for review at a future meeting.
• Existing double-hung windows shall be replaced with new aluminum or wood, aluminum-clad
double hung windows of the similar light configuration, dimensions and profile. The new
windows shall either ne true divided light or simulated divided light (ie, the grids shall be applied
to the exterior window surface). The applicant shall provide corresponding dimension details of
the existing and proposed new windows to staff for review and approval prior to the issuance of
the COA so that staff can determine if the new windows closely match the existing. Should staff
determine that the new windows do not adequately match the existing, staff shall forward the
project to the Commission for review at a future meeting.
• The existing trim shall be retained. Where replacement is necessary, the new trim (brickmould and
mullions) shall replicate the existing in dimension, profile, and detailing
• The new casement windows shall display a light configuration/muntin pattern that matches the
historic muntin pattern as per the property’s designation slides. The new windows shall either ne
true divided light or simulated divided light (ie, the grids shall be applied to the exterior window
surface)
• The mesh screens, when present at the exterior, must be high transparency
