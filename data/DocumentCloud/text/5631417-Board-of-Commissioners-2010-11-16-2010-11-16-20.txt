RECOMMENDATION TO ENTER INTO AN INTERGOVERNMENTAL
AGREEMENT WITH THE CHICAGO PARK DISTRICT
To the Honorable Board of Commissioners:
RECOMMENDATION
It is recommended that the Board of Commissioners authorize the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to enter into an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with the Chicago Park District
(CPD) for the period of January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2011 in an amount not-to-exceed
$400,000 to ensure that residents of Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) have continued access to
year-round recreational programs.

EXPLANATION

CPD provides year-round recreational programs for the benefit of City of Chicago residents.
The current IGA between CHA and CPD, which expires on December 31, 2010, has had a
positive impact on thousands of CHA youth who otherwise may not have been able to participate
in CPD programs due to cost. In 2010, more than 1,700 CHA youth attended summer day camps
through the Park District. CHA and CPD have expanded programming to include year-round
services at a reduced cost to residents of CHA. The expanded services allow youth to participate
in CPD’s recreational after-school “Park Kids” programs in the fall, winter, and spring.
During 2010, CHA youth (age 15) participated in a summer recreational/learning program called
Counselor-in-Training (CIT). Participants worked 20 hours per week at an hourly rate of $8.25
per hour for a period of eight (8) weeks at a local park in their home community. Teens who
participated will be eligible to apply as Recreational Leaders through the Park District when they
reach age 16. In addition, CHA and CPD responded to the Chicago Public Schools “E schedule”
(schools that have moved to a year round schedule with frequent shorter breaks throughout the
year instead of a longer summer vacation) by piloting a fall and winter “vacation camp.” These
camps assist parents who are working by offering something safe and constructive for their
children to do during the Track E school breaks.

 During 2010 CHA and the Park District have collaborated to improve participation and programs
at two key parks (Carver Park, serving Altgeld Gardens and Williams Park, serving Dearborn
Homes). The collaboration brought other key stakeholders together to work on improving the
parks including the Local Advisory Councils, FamilyWorks, CAPS and the Chicago Public
Schools. Among the results, participation in the swimming program at Carver Park and
Williams Park increased. In addition, a new teen softball league was initiated (Windy City
Sluggers) which resulted in 120 (age 13-15) youth participating in an eight park league.
Finally, CHA is also leveraging our partnership with the Park District to encourage participation
in additional Park District programs (e.g. Little League and Pony League, basketball, soccer,
Junior Bears football). In 2010, more than 500 CHA youth participated in these programs
located in or near CHA developments.
In 2011, the IGA will allow CHA and CPD to continue year round services described above at
reduced costs to CHA families. Additionally, in 2011 the camp voucher program will be
expanded to include teens up to 17 years of age, allowing them to partake in activities such as
teen clubs located at parks throughout the City of Chicago. In 2011 CPD will be enhancing the
teen clubs at parks located around CHA properties to accommodate the anticipated increase in
participation through the voucher program. Additional programming will be added for CHA
youth in 2011 including, but not limited to, an expanded softball program, Jr. Bears Football and
other CPD activities and initiatives. It is anticipated that this new level of collaboration will
continue to yield new and enhanced programming and increased participation.
Based on the foregoing, it is in the best interest of the CHA to enter into an IGA for the period of
January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2011 in an amount not-to-exceed $400,000 to provide
access to recreational programs for CHA youth year-round.
