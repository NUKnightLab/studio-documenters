PROPOSED RESOLUTION

REQUEST FOR ANALYSIS OF HEALTHCARE ELIGIBILITY
WHEREAS, Cook County government has begun the process to shore up the current $307 million
shortfall as part of the FY2008 budget process; and
WHEREAS, as a result of this administration's efforts, the budget deficit has been reduced to $239
million; and
WHEREAS, a major portion of this deficit is due to a lackluster performance in patient-fee collection by
the Bureau of Health Services; and
WHEREAS, Chamberlin Edmonds & Associates, Inc. is currently contracted with the Bureau of Health
Services to provide Social Security Income (SSl)/Social Security Disability Income Services (SSDI)
along with Medicaid/Medicare e ligibility; and
WHEREAS, Chamberlin Edmonds & Associates, Inc. has postulated that 70% of the patients on the
eligibility lists at Stroger Hospital of Cook County qualify for some type of SSDI or SSI benefits with the
remaining 30% classified as "self-pay"; and
WHEREAS, the Bureau of Health Services has gone on record to state that 47% of patients are
considered "self-pay", which resu lts in a 17% difference; and
WOE.REAS, this sizable discrepancy complicates the crucial task of trying to assess the status of the
Bureau' s patient base and consequently the potential patient-fee revenue stream; and
WHEREAS, it is essential to have an accurate assessment of the patient fee outlay for the Bureau of
Health Services to provide a credible revenue estimate for the upcoming budget; and
WHEREAS, this estimate may mean the difference between cutting further healthcare services or not.

4007

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 6, 2007

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners, does
hereby request an analysis to be conducted by Chamberlin Edmonds & Associates, Inc. of all applications
processed from their eligibility lists to determine the number of patients who are processed that qualify
for SSDI, SSI, Medicaid or Medicare as well as those with private insurance; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that this analysis be accomplished within 30 days upon passage of this
resolution, so that this Honorable Body has a reliable patient-fee revenue estimate for the FY2008 budget.

Commissioner Moreno, seconded by Commissioner Murphy, moved that the Proposed Resolution be
approved and adopted.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION

THE HOMEOWNER AND BANK PROTECTION ACT
WHEREAS, the onrushing financial crisis involving home mortgages, debt instruments of all types, and
the banking system of the United States threatens to set off an economic collapse worse than the Great
Depression of the 1930s with millions of Americans faced with foreclosure and loss of their homes over
the coming months; and
WHEREAS, this financial crisis threatens the integrity of both Federal and State chartered banks, as
typified by the run on deposits of Countrywide Financial Corporation in California on August 16, which
could wipe out the life savings of too many American people and drastically undermine the economic
stability of our states and cities; and
WHEREAS, under similar circumstances in the 1930s, President Franklin D. Roosevelt successfully
intervened to protect banks and homeowners, addressing Congress with a "declaration of national policy"
on April 13, 1933, which stated "that the broad interests of the Nation require that special safeguards
should be thrown around home ownership as a guarantee of social and economic stability, and that to
protect homeowners from inequitable enforced liquidation in a time of general distress is a proper concern
of the Government."
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners call upon
Congress to take emergency action to protect homeowners and banks by enacting a Homeowners and
Banks Protection Act specifically to:
1.

Establish a Federal agency to place Federal and State chartered banks under protection,
freezing all existing home mortgages for a period of time, adjusting mortgage values to
fair prices, restructuring existing mortgages at appropriate interest rates and writing off
speculative debt obligations of mortgage-backed securities, financial derivatives and
other fonns of financial pyramid schemes that have brought the banking system to the
point of bankruptcy; and

4008

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 6, 2007

2.

Declare a moratorium on all home foreclosures for the duration of the transitional period,
allowing families to retain their homes. Monthly payments, the equivalent of "rental
payments", shall be made to designated banks, which can use the funds as collateral for
nonnal lending practices, thus recapitalizing the banking system. These affordable
monthly payments will be factored into new mortgages, reflecting the orderly deflating of
the housing bubble, the establishment of appropriate property valuations and reduced
fixed mortgage interest rates. No homeowner shall be evicted from his or her property,
and the Federal and State chartered banks shall be protected so that they can resume their
traditional functi ons, serving local communities and facilitating credit for investment in
productive entities; and

3.

Authorize the state government to assume the administrative respons ibilities for
implementing the program, including the "rental" assessments to designated banks, with
the Federal government providing the necessary credits and guarantees to assure the
successful transition.

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that suitable copies of this Resolution be delivered to the President of
the United States Senate, the Speaker of the U nited States House of Representatives, and to each member
of the Illinois congressional delegation and that this text be spread upon the official proceedings of this
Honorable Body.

In accordance with Cook County Code Section 2-108(h)(J ), Commissioner Ma ldonado, seconded by
Commissioner Silvestri, moved to suspend the rules so that this matter may be considered. The motion
carried unanimously.
Commissioner Murphy, seconded by Commissioner Silvestri , moved that the communication be referred

ACCURATE POSITION TITLES AND SALARY GRADES REPORT
WHEREAS, Cook County governmen t is in a challenging budget year and is working on passing a
balanced fi scal year 2008 budget by finding an appropriate balance between cutting expenses and
generating additional revenues; and
WHEREAS, Cook County government is making concentrated efforts to cut expenses by streamlining
operations through the elimination of duplicity in various government departments through consolidation,
increasing revenue collection efforts and improving efficiencies; and

4009

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 6, 2007

WHEREAS, it is nearly impossible for the Board of Commissioners to make thoughtful decisions as to
whether various positions are necessary to the operation and core missions of County departments, when
many budget titles and salary grades contained in the County budget do not accurately describe the work
being performed by people in those budgeted positions; and
WHEREAS, arbitrarily cutting positions is neither conducive to providing core services for which this
government is responsible and upon which our citizens rely, nor to streamlining operations to run
effectively and efficiently; and
WHEREAS, there is a long history of not updating position titles in the County budget as those positions
and the duties of people in those budgeted positions have evolved over the years; and
WHEREAS, it is the desire of this Honorable Body to receive the most accurate information available to
make the necessary changes and decisions to ensure thi s government will be financially viable and
responsible to the taxpayers it represents and efficiently provide the services for which it is mandated; and
WHEREAS, having the necessary information to make informed decisions on where to make cuts if
necessary, is essential to running an effective organization.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners does
hereby request that the Bureau of Human Resources provide the County Board, no later than September 1,
2008, with a list of all positions in the County, by department, which show position titles and salary
grades that accurately reflect the work being performed by people in those positions; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Department of Budget and Management
Services sha ll incorporate this list of updated budget titles and salary grades into the Cook County Board
President's fiscal year 2009 budget recommendation.

Management, Dallas, Texas, for enhancements to the Recorder of Deeds indexing module of the 20/20
Perfect Vis ion System and two (2) years of maintenance and technical support for the Assessor's
Scanning and Document Imaging System. These enhancements will give the Recorder of Deeds the
ability to capture the additional data from the IL PTAX-203 Transfer Declaration Form. This data is
currently being captured by the Assessor' s Office and is needed to support the Illinois Department of
Revenue's Sales Ration Study and the Assessor' s Office A ssessment Cycle. The enhancements to the
Recorder's 20/20 System will e liminate the duplicative data entry efforts being made by the Recorder of
Deeds and the Assessor' s Office, and give the Recorder of Deeds the ability to capture all of the data
needed by the agencies.

System. The Recorder of Deeds and the Assessor's Office Imaging Systems contain ACS
proprietary software or software customized exclusively by ACS to meet business needs. To
have another vendor undertake these enhancements and have them enter our environments to
learn our systems and business processes would be very costly and timely. ACS fully
understands the Recorder of Deeds and Assessor's Office Imaging Systems and the related
business function s that will be implemented, making this the best way to achieve our goals in
a cost efficient manner.

THE VALUATION ESTIMATES FOR COOK COUNTY TAX EXEMPT HOSPITALS REPORT
Transmitting a Communication, dated November 5, 2007 from
JAMES M. HOULIHAN, Cook County Assessor
I would appreciate the addition of the report concerning the valuation estimates for Cook County tax

exempt hospitals to the November 6, 2007 County Board New Items Agenda for purposes of being
received and filed.
This report is in response to a request made by the Board of Commissioners of the Assessor's Office.
Your consideration of this addition to the agenda is very much appreciated.
The issue of the tax exempt status for hospitals has been a subject of considerable debate at the national,
state, and local levels. In 2006, Commissioner Maldonado and other members of the Cook County Board
requested that my office undertake the task of estimating the aggregate assessed value and the resultant
potential tax liability of the Cook County hospitals that are currently exempt from taxation.
This report which I am transmitting to you today is the first step to give an aggregate value of Cook
County's exempt hospitals and to share publicly the methodology, practice, and procedures used to
determine the potential value of these institutions. This report does not attempt to answer the question of
whether the hospitals should be taxable or not, but instead provides an estimate of what their value would
be were they deemed to be taxable.
After more than 13,000 hours of field work documenting millions of square feet of hospital space, this
report provides an initial estimate of the exempt hospitals' aggregate sum of property value for tax
purposes.
However, I want to be clear in stating that this is an initial aggregate estimate; hospitals are highly unique
properties and must undergo thorough individual analysis with direct input from the property owners in
order to establish accurate values for each individual hospital. Also, like other Cook County properties,
each hospital is afforded the opportunity to utilize the appeal process to refine further their specific
assessment.
This has been an extremely polarizing issue. The debate concerning the definition and amount of charity
care has resulted in a discussion of specifics that has at times lost sight of the real issue at hand: what is
the most effective, constitutional and appropriate method to incentivize a public-private partnership that
creates a real and seamless delivery of health care services in Cook County to those most in need.
I hope that this report will provide an initial framework for all parties to come together to resolve this
issue and ensure the best possible health care for the taxpayers of Cook County.

In accordance with Cook County Code Section 2-108(h)(1), Commissioner Maldonado, seconded by

Commissioner Silvestri, moved to suspend the rules so that this matter may be considered. The motion
carried unanimously.
In accordance with Cook County Code Section 2-108(z)(l), Commissioner Maldonado, seconded by

No Cash Bid Request Package for the City of Calumet City.

This correspondence will serve as notification of the interest of the City of Calumet City,
a municipal corporation, in receiving a No Cash Bid for the parcels listed below. This
request package contains 55 property index numbers.
All of the parcels listed are vacant and without improvement, except Property Index

and which use will remain the same. It is the intention of the City of Calumet City to use

any Tax Certificate of Purchase from Cook County or any perfected deed to any Third
Party Requestor. Also, the City of Calumet City will accept an assignment of all Tax

tax search services as necessary to obtain a tax deed and will bear all legal and other costs
associated with the acquisition of the parcels. Also, the City of Calumet City agrees to
submit, to the Cook County Offices of Economic Development, No Cash Bid Reports on
the status of each parcel for five years or until development is complete, whichever
occurs last, as required by the Cook County No Cash Bid Ordinance.
All contacts regarding the No Cash Bid Request Package for the City of Calumet City

CITY OF MARKHAM (NO CASH BID REQUEST). Transmitting a Communication,
dated September 10, 2007 from Deborah Sims, Chairman, Tax Delinquency
Subcommittee, submitting a request from David Webb, Jr., Mayor, City of Markham.
Re:

County "No Cash Bids" on 91 Parcels owned by the City of Markham

On behalf of the City of Markham, I formally make application for Cook County "No
Cash Bids" on 91 parcels. rt is specifically requested that, if approved by the Cook
County Board of Commissioners, the "no cash bids" be made as "over the counter"
forfeiture tax purchases.
This application, being made on behalf of the City of Markham, is somewhat unusual
because the purpose of the City's request is NOT to acquire the 91 parcels by tax deed
proceedings. In fact, the City is currently the record title holder of all 91 parcels and has
owned the 91 parcels since December 7, 1992. The purpose of the City 's request is to
extinguish longstanding real estate tax liens on its property which should have been
exempt from taxation for the years in question. In the event the Board of Commissioners
is willing to assist the City of Markham in this manner, it will make possible the transfer
of the 91 parcels to the Natural Land Institute, which intend to preserve the land in its
natural state as a natural land preserve for future generations. In exchange for the 91
parcels, the Natural Land Institute will convey to the City a tract of land of similar
acreage, which will be the site of future economic development in the City.
The following documentation is submitted in accordance with the C ity's application for
Cook County "No Cash Bids."

4190

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 6, 2007

1.

List of Permanent Index Numbers (PINs) and Volume Number for each parcel
(Exhibit A). As previous ly indicated, the intended use of the 91 parcels is to
prohibit development in order to preserve the land in its natural state, as a natural
land preserve for future generations;

2.

Certified Ordinance of the City of Markham formally req uesting Cook County
"No Cash Bids' ' which inc ludes the PIN and volume number for each of the 91
parcels and the intended use for the parcels (Exhibit B);

3.

A current letter of opinion issued by the Chicago Title Insurance Company
establishing the title status on all 9 1 parcels (Exhibit C);

4.

A Sidwell Tax Map showing the location of all 9 1 parcels (Exhibit D); and,

5.

Photographs of the 91 parcels (Group Exhibit E);

As previously indicated, and as set forth in the Ordinance attached hereto, the benefit to
the City of Markham (provided the County Board agree to make the requested "no cash
bids" on its behalf) w ill be twofo ld. First, the City will be able to convey title to the 9 1
parcels to the Natural Land Institute, free and clear of outstanding real estate tax liens,
who will, under its stewardship, preserve and protect the property as a natural land
preserve for future generations. Second, the City will receive, in exchange, title to a
similar sized tract of land from the Natural Land Institute, which it will be able to
economically develop. Such economic development will provide jobs, increase the
C ity's tax base, and genera lly benefit the City and its citizens.
On behalf of the City of Markham, it is further represented that the C ity has retained me
to cause the outstanding county tax liens to be extinguished and otherwise complete the
real estate tran saction set forth herein and in the Ordinance attached as Exhibit B. The
City and the Natural Land Institute will bear all legal and other costs associated with
extinguishing the real estate tax liens and completing the real estate tra nsactions
described herein.
In the event the documentation provided is deficient in any way, kindly contact me so I
can supplement the documentation provided, per your requirements.

VILLAGE OF BROOKFIELD (NO CASH BID REQUEST).
Communication, dated August 31, 2007 from Deborah Sims, Chairman, Tax Delinquency
Subcommittee, submitting a request from Riccardo F. Ginex, Village Manager, Village of
Brookfield.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 6, 2007

The Village of Brookfield, Illinois, would like to apply to make an over-the-counter nocash bid for the following parcel:
Volume 176

15-34-100-001-0000

This request package contains one Property Index Number. This parcel is located at 3101
Grand Boulevard, Brookfield, Illinois 60513. This parcel is a corner lot upon which a
welcome sign for the Village of Brookfield is located, and the Village intends to continue
to use this parcel for that purpose. By allowing the Village to obtain this parcel through
the Cook County No-Cash Bid Program, the Village will be able to continue to
accommodate the maintenance of its welcome sign.
Enclosed please find the ordinance passed by the Village formally requesting that a nocash bid be made for this parcel. The Village agrees to submit an annual report on the
status of this parcel for five years or until development is complete, whichever occurs
last, as required by the Cook County No-Cash Bid Ordinance to the Cook County Office
of Economic Development, 69 West Washington Street, Suite 2900, Chicago, lllinoi s
60602. Furthermore, the Village represents that no Third Party Request by a developer or
organization exists by which the no-cash bid for this parcel located in volume 176 with
the Property Index Number 15-34-100-001-0000 will result in the conveyance of the
perfected deed by the Village of Brookfield.
The following Property Index Number was withdrawn from the list approved in the
ordinance:
Volume 176

15-34-100-002-0000

A no-cash bid for this Property Index Number is no longer requested because a title
search revealed that the property has not been tax delinquent for two (2) years; and
therefore, the property is not eligible for participation in the Cook County No-Cash Bid
Program.
The Village authorizes and directs the Village attorneys, Storino, Ramello & Durkin,
9501 West Devon Avenue, Rosemont, Illinois, 60018 to obtain the tax deed to this
property. The Village of Brookfield will bear all legal and other costs associated with the
acquisition of this parcel.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 6, 2007

Commissioner Butler, seconded by Commissioner Murphy, moved approval of Communication No.
289334. The motion carried unanimously.
Commissioner Peraica inquired what monitoring Cook County currently conducts to ensure that parcels
of land that go to deed, are returned in a timely manner to the tax roll and are being used for the purpose
originally espoused.
Jacqueline K. Harder, Economic Development Project Director, Department of Planning and
Development, replied that Cook County requires that owners submit annual updates. She further stated
that the Department of Planning and Development currently partners with the Cook County Tax
Reactivation Program to work with various municipalities on these issues.
Chairman Sims stated that there is a high incidence of lawyers not going to deed, and that this is highly
problematic.
Commissioner Murphy inquired what control Cook County has over parcels of land after they are
released.
Randy Kemmer, Assistant State 's Attorney, State's Attorney 's Office stated that Cook County
relinquishes control after sale, once the transfer is complete. He further stated that under current law the
property must go to deed within three years; once this period of time has elapsed it is impossible go to
deed.
Chairman Sims stated that she is working with the Department of Planning and Development on these
issues, especially as it concerns municipalities that do not follow through on their responsibilities.
At the request of Commissioner Peraica, Chairman Sims granted leave for Mr. Rodney C. Slutzky,
Attorney at Law, Slutzky & Blumenthal, to speak.
Mr. Slutzky offered the following clarification: Once a deed is acquired by a new owner, the only
enforcement option available to Cook County would be to create incentives for the owner to fulfill his
originally stated intent. Mr. Slutzky further stated that he believes there is no need for a statutory change
as pertains to County monitoring.

Commissioner Moreno moved to adjourn the meeting, seconded by Commissioner Butler. The
motion carried and the meeting was adjourned.
