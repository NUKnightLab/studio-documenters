faxed, emailed or mailed to you.

 

A license issued with multiple drawing or play dates will receive one financial statement
in the license packet, ALL revenue, expenses and prizes from each drawing date is to
be combined and reported on that single ?nancial statement.

if you are conducting a gaming event, such as a raffle, in conjunction with a dinner or
other event and the event ticketis also used as a raffle ticket. the raffle ticket cost
should be factored minus the dinner or event cost.

For example: If the event ticket cost $20 dollars and the raffle ticket value is $5 then
you would calculate on your ?nancial statement the gross sales of the raffle ticket value
only. The revenue, expenses andprize lines would reflect only the expense and prizes
related to the raffle.

RE: City Council Appoin tee Vacancy on the Detroit Land BankAutlJorigr

On November 1, 2018, lVir. Rasul Raheem, the City Council Appointee to the Detroit Land Bank Authority
resigned due to a con?ict of interest stemming from pending litigation between Dykema law ?rm and the
DLBA. To date, the position remains vacant thus creating a lack of City Council representation on the board.
To ensure adequate and fair representation on the DLBA, I would like to nominate Mrs. Miranda Morrow-
Bartell to ?ll the remainder of Mr. Raheem?s term. I would like this matter to be referred to the Internal
Operations Standing Committee for further consideration. If you have any questions, please contact my Policy
Analyst, Edwina King, at 313.224.9530.

Thank you for your cooperation.
