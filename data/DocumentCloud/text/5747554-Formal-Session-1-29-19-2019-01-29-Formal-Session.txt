RE: Willie Parker, et al City of Detroit
CASE NO.: 18-003672-NF
FILE NO.: L18-00204 (PMC)

On January 15, 2019, a case evaluation panel evaluated the above-captioned lawsuit and awarded
FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS AND NO CENTS in favor of the plaintiff.
The parties have until February 12, 2019, to either accept or reject the case evaluation. Failure to
?le a written acceptance or rejection within this period constitutes a rejection.

Based upon our review of the facts and particulars of this lawsuit, which are set forth in a
con?dential memorandum that is being separately hand-delivered to each member of Your
Honorable Body, it is our considered opinion that acceptance of the case evaluation award is in

the best interest of the City of Detroit.

We, therefore, request Your Honorable Body to authorize acceptance of the case evaluation award;
and, in the event that the plaintiff accepts the award, to deem such acceptance as a settlement and
to direct the Finance Director to issue a draft to Willie Parker and his attorneys Harris, Altman,
P.C., in the amount of FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS AND NO CENTS to
be delivered upon receipt of a properly executed Release, and Stipulation and Order of Dismissal
entered in Lawsuit No. approved by the Law Department.
