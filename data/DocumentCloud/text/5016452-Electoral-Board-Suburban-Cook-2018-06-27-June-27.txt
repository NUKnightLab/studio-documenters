a.

An applicant must obtain from the municipality in which the real estate is located
or the County Board if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, an
Ordinance or Resolution expressly stating that the municipality or County Board,
as the case may be, has determined that the incentive provided by Class 6b is

Class 6b application to the Assessor.
In addition, the Ordinance or Resolution shall:

Describe the redevelopment objective of the municipality;

2.

State the applicant's intended use of the property; and

 3.

State that an Economic Disclosure Statement, as defined in this Division,

the Assessor no later than the date an assessment appeal is filed to request the class
change to Class 6b. If the Resolution is not filed at the time of the eligibility
application, the applicant shall instead file, at that time, a letter from the
municipality or the County, as the case may be, confirming that a Resolution or
Ordinance supporting the incentive has been requested. If the real estate is located
within an Industrial Growth Zone, prior to filing a Class 6b eligibility application
with the Assessor and in lieu of an Ordinance or Resolution, an applicant may
obtain from an authorized officer of the municipality or an authorized officer of
the Cook County Bureau of Economic Development if the real estate is located in
an unincorporated area, a letter stating that the municipality or the County Board,
as the case may be, supports and consents to the filing of the Class 6b application
with the Assessor. Such authorized officer shall have been designated by the
legislative body of the municipality or, in the case of an unincorporated area, by
the Cook County Board.
A copy of the authorized officer letter and a certified copy of the legislative action
designating the authorized officer shall be included with the Class 6b application

certified copy of the legislative action designating the authorized officer, the

and other structures must be made to the Assessor within one year prior to the
commencement of such new construction or substantial rehabilitation to qualify
for a Class 6b incentive. With respect to abandoned property, the Class 6b
application must be made to the Assessor prior to the commencement of the
reoccupation of the vacant and unused property.

d.

In the instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property
as defined herein, the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may
still determine that special circumstances justify finding that the property is
deemed "abandoned" for purpose of Class 6b, unless:
1.

There has been a purchase for value and the buildings and other structures
have not been vacant and unused prior to such purchase; or

2.

There has been no purchase for value and the buildings and other
structures have been vacant and unused for less than 24 continuous
months.

The finding of abandonment, along with the specification of the special
circumstances, shall be included in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and
consenting to the Class 6b application. If the Ordinance or Resolution is that of a
municipality, the approval of the County Board is required to validate such a
finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b, and a
County Resolution to that effect shall be obtained. The applicant must obtain the
municipal enabling Ordinance with the required finding of special circumstances
and present such municipal Ordinance to the Board of Commissioners of Cook
County prior to its determination as to whether it will validate such a finding that
the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b and provide a County
Resolution to that effect. A certified copy of an Ordinance or Resolution finding
that special circumstances exist, as well as a certified copy of a County Ordinance
or Resolution validating such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned"
for purposes of Class 6b need not be filed at the time of filing the Class 6b

6b. If the Resolution is not filed at the time of the Class 6b eligibility application,
the applicant shall instead file, at that time, a letter from the municipality or the
County as the case may be, confirming that a Resolution or Ordinance regarding
special circumstances has been requested.
If the real estate is located within an Industrial Growth Zone, prior to filing a Class
6b eligibility application with the Assessor and in lieu of an Ordinance or
Resolution, an applicant may obtain from an authorized officer of the municipality
or an authorized officer of the Cook County Bureau of Economic Development if
the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, a letter stating that the
municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, supports and consents to the
filing of the Class 6b application with the Assessor. Such authorized officer shall
have been designated by the legislative body of the municipality or, in the case of
an unincorporated area, by the Cook County Board.

 A copy of the authorized officer letter and a certified copy of the legislative action
designating the authorized officer shall be included with the Class 6b application
and submitted to the Cook County Bureau of Economic Development for
verification prior to filing of the application with the Assessor.
In addition, the letter from the authorized officer shall:

certified copy of the legislative action designating the authorized officer, the
Bureau of Economic Development will forward the application to the Assessor's
Office for filing. A certified copy of the legislative action designating the
authorized officer and the authorized officer letter shall be included with the Class
6b application at the time of filing the application with the Assessor. The applicant
must demonstrate that the industrial development project qualifies for the Class 6b
classification.
Temporary Emergency Economic Recovery Modification (TEERM) Program: In
the instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property
as defined herein, the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may
still determine that special circumstances justify finding that the property is
deemed "abandoned" for purpose of a Class 6b under the TEERM Program if:
1.

There has been no purchase for value; and

2.

The buildings and other structures have been vacant and unused for at least
12 continuous months.

The finding of abandonment, along with the specification of the special
circumstances, and a determination that the applicant's participation in the TEERM
Program is necessary for the development to occur, and that without such
designation the industrial enterprise would not be economically viable causing the
property to be in imminent risk of remaining vacant and unused, shall be included
in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and consenting to the Class 6b
application under the TEERM Program.
In addition, the Ordinance or Resolution where applicable shall:
1.

Describe the redevelopment objective of the municipality;

2.

State the applicant's intended use of the property; and

 3.

State that an Economic Disclosure Statement, as defined in this Division,
was received and filed by the municipality or County Board, as the case
may be.

If the Ordinance or Resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the County
Board is required to validate such a finding that the property is deemed
"abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b, and a County Resolution to that effect shall
be obtained. The applicant must obtain the municipal enabling Ordinance with the
required finding of special circumstances and present such municipal Ordinance
to the Board of Commissioners of Cook County prior to its determination as to
whether it will validate such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for
purposes of Class 6b and provide a County Resolution to that effect. A certified
copy of an Ordinance or Resolution finding that special circumstances exist, as
well as a certified copy of a County Ordinance or Resolution validating such a
finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b need not
be filed at the time of filing the Class 6b application with the Assessor, but must
be filed with the Assessor no later than the date an assessment appeal is filed to
request the class change to Class 6b. If the Resolution is not filed at the time of the
Class 6b application, the applicant shall instead file, at that time, a letter from the
municipality or the County as the case may be, confirming that a Resolution or
Ordinance regarding special circumstances has been requested.
Critical Emergency Employee Retention Modification (CEERM) Program: In the
instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as
defined herein, the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may still
determine that special circumstances justify finding that the property is deemed
"abandoned" for purpose of a Class 6b under the CEERM Program if:
1.

There has been no purchase for value; and

2.

The buildings and other structures have been vacant and unused for at least
3 continuous months; and

3.

The applicant has provided sufficient documentation to establish that such
applicant will create or maintain at least 250 jobs for employees at the
subject location. For purposes of this Section, the term "employee" shall
mean an individual who performs duties or services at the subject location
on average at least 30 hours per week in any two-week period for which
such individual is paid; "hours per week" shall mean hours for which an
individual is paid or entitled to payment for a period of time during which
no duties are performed by such individual due to vacation, holiday,
illness, incapacity, jury duty, military duty or approved leave of absence.

The finding of abandonment, along with the specification of the special
circumstances, and a determination that the applicant's participation in the CEERM
Program is necessary for the development to occur, and that without such
designation the industrial enterprise would not be economically viable causing the
property to be in imminent risk of remaining vacant and unused, shall be included
in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and consenting to the Class 6b
application under the CEERM Program.

 In addition, the Ordinance or Resolution where applicable shall:
1.

Describe the redevelopment objective of the municipality; and

2.

State the applicant’s intended use of the property; and

3.

State that an Economic Disclosure Statement, as defined in this Division,
was received and filed by the municipality or the County Board, as the
case may be.

The CEERM Program shall be limited to the party who is the initial applicant of
the Class 6b incentive under the CEERM Program and the subject of the municipal
Resolution or Ordinance.
If the Ordinance or Resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the County
Board is required to validate such a finding that the property is deemed
"abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b, and a County Resolution to that effect shall
be obtained. The applicant must obtain the municipal enabling Ordinance with the
required finding of special circumstances and present such municipal Ordinance
to the Board of Commissioners of Cook County prior to its determination as to
whether it will validate such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for
purposes of Class 6b under the CEERM Program and provide a County Resolution
to that effect. A certified copy of an Ordinance or Resolution finding that special
circumstances exist, as well as a certified copy of a County Ordinance or resolution
validating such a finding that the property is deemed “abandoned” for purposes of
Class 6b need not be filed at the time of filing the Class 6b application with the
Assessor, but must be filed with the Assessor no later than the date an assessment
appeal is filed to request the class change to Class 6b. If the Resolution is not filed
at the time of the Class 6b application, the applicant shall instead file, at that time,
a letter from the municipality or the County as the case may be, confirming that a
Resolution or Ordinance regarding special circumstances has been requested.
Sustainable Emergency Relief (SER) Program: In the instance where real estate
does not meet the definition of abandoned property as defined herein, the
municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may still determine that
special circumstances justify finding that the property is deemed "qualified" for
purpose of Class 6b under the SER Program if:
1.

The industrial enterprise that occupies the premises has been at the same
location for a minimum of ten years prior to the date of application for the
SER Program; and

2.

The industrial enterprise that occupies the premises submits evidence of
hardship supporting a determination that participation in the SER Program
is necessary for the industrial enterprise to continue operations at its
current location and maintain its staff, and that without such designation
the industrial enterprise would not be economically viable causing the
property to be in imminent risk of becoming vacant and unused.

 The finding that a property is qualified, along with the specification of the special
circumstances, and a determination that the applicant's participation in the SER
Program is necessary for the industrial enterprise to continue operations at its
current location and maintain its staff, and that without such designation the
industrial enterprise would not be economically viable causing the property to be
in imminent risk of becoming vacant and unused, shall be included in the
Resolution or Ordinance supporting and consenting to the Class 6b application
under the SER Program.
In addition, the Ordinance or Resolution where applicable shall:
1.

Describe the redevelopment objective of the municipality;

2.

State the applicant's intended use of the property; and

3.

State that an Economic Disclosure Statement, as defined in this Division,
was received and filed by the municipality or County Board, as the case
may be.

If the Ordinance or Resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the County
Board is required to validate such a finding that the property is deemed "qualified"
for purposes of Class 6b, and a County Resolution to that effect shall be obtained.
The applicant must obtain the municipal enabling Ordinance with the required
finding of special circumstances and present such municipal Ordinance to the
Board of Commissioners of Cook County prior to its determination as to whether
it will validate such a finding that the property is deemed "qualified" for purposes
of Class 6b and provide a County Resolution to that effect. A certified copy of an
Ordinance or Resolution finding that special circumstances exist, as well as a
certified copy of a County Ordinance or Resolution validating such a finding that
the property is deemed "qualified" for purposes of Class 6b need not be filed at the
time of filing the Class 6b application with the Assessor, but must be filed with the
Assessor no later than the date an assessment appeal is filed to request the class
change to Class 6b. If the Resolution is not filed at the time of the Class 6b
application, the applicant shall instead file, at that time, a letter from the
municipality or the County as the case may be, confirming that a Resolution or
Ordinance regarding special circumstances has been requested.
Applications for Class 6b incentives pursuant to the TEERM Program or SER
Program must be received by the Assessor's Office on or before November 30,
2018 to receive consideration.

 The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of annual reports by recipients of
Class 6b incentives granted pursuant to the SER Program as to the use of the
property and the number of persons employed at the Class 6b site. In such reports,
recipients shall be required to certify whether the industrial enterprise that
occupied the premises at the time of the SER application continues its operations
at that location. In addition, recipients of Class 6b incentives granted pursuant to
the SER Program shall be required to report to the Assessor within 30 days if the
industrial enterprise that occupied the premises at the time of the SER application
ceases operations at that location. A copy of such reports will be forwarded by the
Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the County Board for distribution to members
of the County Board from the affected districts. Failure to file such reports within
the time established by the Assessor's rules shall result in loss of the incentive for
the period relating to the non-filing. Additionally, if the industrial enterprise that
occupied the premises at the time of the SER application ceases operations at that
location, then the Class 6b incentive granted pursuant to the SER program shall
terminate.
e.

This classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the date such new
construction (excluding demolition, if any) or such substantial rehabilitation was
completed and initially assessed, or in the case of abandoned property, from the
date of substantial re-occupancy, or in the case of incentives granted pursuant to
the TEERM Program or the CEERM Program, from the date of the notice of
approval. In the case of incentives granted pursuant to the SER Program, this
classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the date of the notice of
approval, or until the industrial enterprise that occupied the premises at the time of
the SER application ceases operations at that location if that occurs sooner.

f.

Unless a Class 6b granted pursuant to the TEERM Program or the SER Program
or the CEERM Program, this incentive may be renewed during the last year a
property is entitled to a ten percent assessment level pursuant to Section 74-64(7),
if the following requirements are met:
1.

The taxpayer notifies the Assessor's Office of intent to request renewal of
the incentive from the municipality or the County Board if the real estate
is located in an unincorporated area;

2.

The municipality in which the real estate is located or the County Board,
if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, adopts a Resolution
expressly stating that the municipality or the County Board, as the case
may be, has determined that the industrial use of the property is necessary
and beneficial to the local economy, and supports and consents to renewal
of the Class 6b; and

3.

A copy of the Resolution and a completed renewal application are filed
with the Assessor's Office before the expiration of the ten percent
assessment level period.

 (8)

g.

Class 6b incentives that are granted pursuant to the TEERM Program or SER
Program or the CEERM Program are not renewable. For all other Class 6b
incentives, the number of renewal periods is not limited as long as the property
continues to apply and meet the requirements for Class 6b.

h.

A copy of the request for renewal of the incentive will be forwarded by the
Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the County Board for distribution to members
of the County Board from the affected districts.

i.

If no renewal is obtained, the incentive shall be phased out over the next two years,
pursuant to Section 74-64(7). After expiration of the last incentive period, the real
estate shall revert to the applicable classification under this Division.

j.

The Assessor may adopt rules consistent with this subsection necessary to ensure
proper review of all factors relevant to determine eligibility for the benefits
provided under Class 6b.

k.

The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports
by all Class 6b recipients as to the use of the property and the number of persons
employed at the Class 6b site. A copy of such reports will be forwarded by the
Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the County Board for distribution to members
of the County Board from the affected districts. Failure to file such reports within
the time established by the Assessor's rules shall result in loss of the incentive for
the period relating to the non-filing.

Class C. Real estate which is to be used for industrial or commercial purposes, including
abandoned property, as defined in Section 74-62, including the land upon which such
property is situated; or vacant land; where such real estate because of contamination has
undergone environmental testing and remediation and has received a "No Further
Remediation Letter" from the site remediation program.
a.

To be eligible for a Class C classification an applicant must have received a "No
Further Remediation Letter" confirming achievement of the remediation
objectives based on the industrial or commercial use.

b.

The owner of the property is rendered ineligible for the Class C classification by
having previously owned or operated the site, directly or indirectly, or having been
a partner or being associated through a family or business relationship with anyone
who has owned or operated the site, which ownership or operation caused the
contamination which was remediated pursuant to a site remediation, except for an
employee who worked for an owner, as defined herein, that operated the site. A
present owner or employer who can successfully demonstrate that the owner or
employer was not responsible for the contamination may be eligible for Class C
classification.

 c.

An applicant must obtain from the municipality in which the real estate is located
or the County Board if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, an
Ordinance or Resolution expressly stating that the municipality or County Board,
as the case may be, has determined that the incentive provided by Class C is
necessary for development to occur on that specific real estate and that the
municipality or County Board, as the case may be, supports and consents to the
Class C application to the Assessor. A certified copy of the Ordinance or
Resolution must be filed at the time of application for the Class C classification. A
copy of that Ordinance or Resolution, whichever is submitted, will be forwarded
by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the Board for distribution to the
members of the County Board from the affected districts.
In addition, the Ordinance or Resolution shall:
1.

Describe the redevelopment objective of the municipality;

2.

State the applicant's intended use of the property; and

3.

State that an Economic Disclosure Statement, as defined in this Division,
was received and filed by the municipality or County Board, as the case
may be.

d.

To qualify for the Class C classification, an application for Class C classification
must be made within one year of the receipt of the "No Further Remediation
Letter". Where an application for Class C classification encompasses less than all
of the contiguous property owned by the applicant upon which remediation has
been completed, the one-year limitation will be waived for any subsequent separate
application for Class C classification for the remainder or for additional portions
of the property, provided that such subsequent application is made within seven
years.

e.

Additionally, to qualify for the Class C classification, the estimated remediation
costs, including site investigation, testing, oversight, remediation and removal
costs, monitoring, and engineering and legal fees associated with the remediation
process, must total at least $100,000.00, or alternatively, must total at least 25
percent of the market value of the real estate as determined by the Assessor's
property record card in the year prior to the remediation, whichever is less.

f.

The initial Class C classification shall continue for a period of 12 years for both
industrial and commercial property. For industrial property, this incentive may be
renewed during the last year a property is entitled to a 16-percent assessment level,
if the following requirements are met:
1.

The taxpayer notifies the Assessor's Office of the taxpayer's intent to
request renewal of the incentive from the municipality, or the County
Board if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area;

 2.

The municipality in which the real estate is located or the County Board,
if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, adopts a Resolution
expressly stating that the municipality or County Board, as the case may
be, has determined that the industrial use of the property is necessary and
beneficial to the local economy, and supports and consents to renewal of
the Class C; and

3.

A copy of that Resolution and a completed renewal application are filed
with the Office of the Assessor before the expiration of the 16-percent
assessment level period.

The number of renewal periods is not limited as long as the property continues to
apply and qualify for Class C. Any property which applies for Class C treatment
on or before the adoption date of the ordinance from which this division is derived
will be eligible for this renewal term at the end of their original incentive period
subject to the above requirements. The notice of intent to request renewal which is
filed with the Assessor's Office will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the
Secretary of the Board for distribution to members of the County Board from the
effected districts.
g.

If, on November 23, 1999, a property is receiving Class C treatment, but the
assessment level is higher than 16 percent, that taxpayer may apply for renewal as
outlined above and receive a 16-percent assessment level for the prescribed period
beginning after the filing and approval of the resolution and renewal application.
However, if, as of that effective date, the taxpayer's assessment is higher than 16
percent and the taxpayer is granted a renewal of the incentive for subsequent years,
no reduction of the current assessment level based on renewal of the incentive will
be granted. If no renewal is obtained, the incentive shall be phased out over the
next two years, pursuant to Section 74-64. After such ten-year period expiration of
the last incentive period, the real estate shall revert to the applicable classification
under this Division.

h.

For commercial properties, once the original 12-year incentive period has expired,
the commercial Class C incentive will expire. The incentive classification will not
be subject to renewal and the real estate shall revert to the applicable classification
under this Division.

i.

The Assessor shall review the application and supporting documentation to
determine eligibility for the Class C classification. The Assessor may adopt rules
consistent with the foregoing necessary to ensure proper review of all factors
relevant to determine initial and continued eligibility for the benefits provided
under the Class C classification.

j.

The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports
by all Class C recipients as to the use of the property and the number of persons
employed at the Class C site. Such reports shall be verified. Failure to file such
reports within the time established by the Assessor's rules shall result in loss of the
incentive for the period relating to the non-filing.

Class 7a. Real estate used primarily for commercial purposes, comprising a qualified
commercial development project, as determined pursuant to Section 74-65(a), located in
an area in need of commercial development, where total development costs, exclusive of
land, do not exceed $2,000,000.00, consisting of all newly constructed buildings or other
structures, including the land upon which they are situated; or abandoned property, as
defined in this Division, including the land upon which such property is situated; or all
buildings and other structures which are substantially rehabilitated to the extent such

the square footage added by the rehabilitation bears to the total square footage of the
improvements on the parcel.
a.

In the instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property
as defined herein, the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may
still determine that special circumstances justify that the property is deemed
"abandoned" for purposes of Class 7a. The finding of abandonment, along with the
specification of the special circumstances, shall be included in the Resolution or
Ordinance supporting and consenting to the Class 7a application.
In addition, the Ordinance or Resolution shall:
1.

Describe the redevelopment objective of the municipality;

2.

State the applicant's intended use of the property; and

3.

State that an Economic Disclosure Statement, as defined in this Division,
was received and filed by the municipality or County Board, as the case
may be.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, special circumstances may not be
determined to justify finding that a property is deemed "abandoned"
where:
A.

There has been a purchase for value and the buildings and other
structures have not been vacant and unused prior to such purchase;
or

B.

There has been no purchase for value and the buildings and other
structures have been vacant and unused for less than 24
continuous months.

If a municipality enacts enabling legislation which a.) identifies, by permanent
index numbers, specific retail corridors or geographies within the boundaries of
such municipality that it deems to be distressed and in need of development; b.)
authorizes the submission of applications for a Class 7a incentive for properties
within such retail corridors, and c.) designates the authorized officer of such
municipality, then applicants for a Class 7a incentive located in such retail
corridors may obtain and submit, in lieu of an Ordinance or Resolution, a letter
from the authorized officer of the municipality approving the submission of the

 Class 7a incentive application and a certified copy of the municipal enabling
legislation.
A copy of the authorized officer letter and a certified copy of the municipal
enabling legislation shall be included with the Class 7a application and submitted

1.

Describe the redevelopment objective of the municipality;

2.

State the applicant's intended use of the property; and

3.

State that an Economic Disclosure Statement, as defined in this Division,
was received and filed by the municipality or County Board, as the case
may be.

Following verification that the Class 7a application is in a retail corridor, as defined
herein, and has been properly submitted with a letter from an authorized officer
and a certified copy of the municipal enabling legislation, the Bureau of Economic
Development will forward the application to the Assessor's Office for filing. The
Resolution or Ordinance, or the authorization letter and a certified copy of the

application. If the Ordinance or Resolution is that of a municipality, the approval
of the County Board is required to validate such a finding that the property is
deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 7a and a Resolution to that effect shall
be included with the Class 7a eligibility application filed with the Assessor.
b.

This classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the date such new
construction (excluding demolition, if any) or such substantial rehabilitation was
completed and initially assessed, or in the case of abandoned property, from the
date of substantial re-occupancy. This incentive classification will be subject to
renewal. Upon termination, the real estate shall revert to the applicable
classification under this Division.

c.

The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports
by all Class 7a recipients as to the use of the property and the number of persons
employed at the Class 7a site. Such reports shall be verified. Failure to file such
reports within the time established by the Assessor's rules shall result in loss of the
incentive for the period relating to the non-filing.

of the improvements on the parcel.
a.

In the instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property
as defined herein, the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may
still determine that special circumstances justify finding that the property is
deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 7b. The finding of abandonment, along

Resolution or Ordinance supporting and consenting to the Class 7b application.
In addition, the Ordinance or Resolution shall:
1.

Describe the redevelopment objective of the municipality;

2.

structures have not been vacant and unused prior to such purchase;
or

B.

There has been no purchase for value and the buildings and other

Ordinance or Resolution expressly stating that:
(i)

The property, site, or area is deemed a redevelopment priority by the

In addition, the Ordinance or Resolution shall:
1.

Describe the redevelopment objective of the municipality;

2.

State the applicant's intended use of the property; and

If a municipality enacts enabling legislation which a.) identifies, by permanent
index numbers, specific retail corridors or geographies within the boundaries of
such municipality that it deems to be distressed and in need of development; b.)
authorizes the submission of applications for a Class 7c incentive for properties
within such retail corridors, and c.) designates the authorized officer of the such
municipality, then applicants for a Class 7c incentive located in such retail
corridors may obtain and submit, in lieu of an Ordinance or Resolution, a letter
from the authorized officer of the municipality approving the submission of the
Class 7c incentive application and a certified copy of the municipal enabling
legislation.
A copy of the authorized officer letter and a certified copy of the municipal
enabling legislation shall be included with the Class 7c application and submitted
to the Cook County Bureau of Economic Development for verification prior to
filing of the application with the Assessor.
In addition, the letter from the authorized officer shall:

2.

State the applicant's intended use of the property; and

3.

State that an Economic Disclosure Statement, as defined in this Division,

herein, and has been properly submitted with a letter from an authorized officer
and a certified copy of the municipal enabling legislation, the Bureau of Economic
Development will forward the application to the Assessor's Office for filing.
In order to determine Class 7c applications, an application for Class 7c shall be
submitted to the Assessor and the Bureau of Economic Development. Upon receipt
of the application and all the necessary supporting data, the Economic
Development Advisory Committee of the County, within 30 days return the
application to the Assessor with a finding stating whether the conditions of
Subsections (a)(1)-(a)(4) of this Section are present. The Assessor shall review the
application, supporting data, findings of the Committee and other appropriate facts.
Where the Assessor finds the conditions of Subsections (a)(1)-(a)(4) of this Section
exist, the Assessor shall, within 30 days of the receipt of the Committee's findings,
certify the commercial development project eligible for Class 7c treatment under
this Division.
Where the Economic Development Advisory Committee does not return a finding
stating whether the conditions of Subsections (a)(1)-(a)(4) of this Section are
present within 30 days, and upon further application of the requesting party, the
Assessor may review the application, supporting data, and other appropriate facts
and certify the commercial development project eligible for Class 7c treatment and
grant the incentive.
(1)

That the Property's (the real estate that is subject of the Incentive
application) Assessed Value, Equalized Assessed Value or Real estate
taxes for three of the last six years, have declined or remained stagnant due
to the depressed condition;

(2)

There is a reasonable expectation that the development, re-development or
rehabilitation of the commercial development project is viable and likely
to go forward on a reasonably timely basis if granted Class 7c designation
and will therefore result in the economic enhancement of the property;

(3)

Certification of the commercial development project for Class 7c
designation will materially assist development, redevelopment or
rehabilitation of the property and the commercial development property
would not go forward without the full incentive offered under Class 7c;
and

(4)

Certification of the commercial development project for Class 7c
designation is reasonably expected to ultimately result in an increase in
real property tax revenue and employment opportunities of the property.

 b.

A certified copy of the Ordinance or Resolution, or authorization letter and
certified copy of the municipal enabling legislation (if applicable), need not be
filed at the time of filing the Class 7c eligibility application with the Assessor, but
must be filed with the Assessor no later than the date an assessment appeal is filed
to request the class change to Class 7c. If the Resolution is not filed at the time of
the eligibility application, the applicant may instead file, at that time, a letter from
the municipality or the County, as the case may be, confirming that a Resolution
or Ordinance supporting the incentive has been requested.

c.

A copy of the Resolution or letter confirming that a Resolution has been requested,
whichever is filed with the application, will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office
to the Secretary of the County Board for distribution to the members of the County
Board from the affected districts.

d.

Class 7c applications for newly constructed or substantially rehabilitated buildings
and other structures must be made to the Assessor within one year prior to the
commencement of such new construction or substantial rehabilitation to qualify
for a Class 7c incentive. With respect to abandoned property, the Class 7c
application must be made to the Assessor prior to the commencement of the
reoccupation of the vacant and unused property. For the purpose of this Incentive
[Class 7c] "abandoned property" shall mean property where the buildings and other
structures, or portions thereof, have been vacant and unused for more than 12
continuous months and as established by rule of the Assessor.

e.

This classification shall continue for a period of three years from the date such new
construction (excluding demolition, if any) such substantial rehabilitation was
completed and initially assessed, or in the case of abandoned property, from the
date of substantial occupancy.

f.

Class 7c incentives that are granted are renewable.
The incentive shall be phased out after five years, pursuant to Section 74-64(8).
After expiration of the last incentive period, the real estate shall revert to the
applicable classification under this Division.

g.

The Assessor may adopt rules consistent with this subsection necessary to ensure
proper review of all factors relevant to determine eligibility and continued
eligibility for the benefits provided under Class 7c.

h.

Class 7c Applications must be received by the Assessor's Office on or before
November 30, 2019, to receive consideration.

i.

Renewal. The Class 7c Incentive shall be limited to only one renewal. The
applicant may apply for a renewal on or after the third year of the Incentive, but
before the expiration of the fifth year of the Incentive. The applicant must obtain
the municipal enabling Ordinance and present such municipal Ordinance to the

(12)

Effective Year. The Class 7c Incentive shall be effective for the tax year the
application for the Incentive is filed. In addition, the Class 7c Incentive may be
applied for only one year prior to the tax year in which the Incentive was applied
via a certificate of error.

Class 8. Real estate used primarily for industrial and commercial purposes, consisting of
all newly constructed buildings or other structures, including the land upon which they are
situated; or abandoned property, as defined in this division, including the land upon which
such property is situated; or all buildings and other structures which are substantially
rehabilitated to the extent such rehabilitation has added to their value, including qualified
land related to the rehabilitation.
a.

b.

Land qualifies when the rehabilitation adds vertical or horizontal square footage to
the improvements. The amount of land eligible for the incentive shall be in such
proportion as the square footage added by the rehabilitation bears to the total
square footage of the improvements on the parcel. Such real estate must be either
obtained through the Cook County Tax Reactivation Project or must be located in
one of the following designated geographical areas:
1.

An area which has been certified as in need of substantial revitalization in
accordance with the provisions of Section 74-65(b);

2.

An enterprise community as proposed and approved by the County Board
on June 22, 1994, or the Chicago City Council on May 18, 1994, and the
municipality in which such real estate is located, or, if in an unincorporated
area, the County must by lawful Resolution determine that such real estate
is consistent with an overall plan for the rehabilitation of the area; or

3.

Any one of the following five townships: Bloom, Bremen, Calumet, Rich
and Thornton.

In the instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property
as defined herein, the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may
still determine that special circumstances justify that the property is deemed
"abandoned" for purpose of Class 8, unless:
1.

There has been a purchase for value and the buildings and other structures
have not been vacant and unused prior to such purchase; or

2.

There has been no purchase for value and the buildings and other
structures have been vacant and unused for less than 24 continuous
months.

The finding of abandonment, along with the specification of the special
circumstances, shall be included in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and
consenting to the Class 8 application.
In addition, the Ordinance or Resolution where applicable shall:
1.

Describe the redevelopment objective of the municipality;

 2.

State the applicant's intended use of the property; and

3.

State that an Economic Disclosure Statement, as defined in this Division,
was received and filed by the municipality or County Board, as the case
may be.

If the Ordinance or Resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the County
Board is required to validate such, a finding that the property is deemed
"abandoned" for purposes of Class 8, and a Resolution to that effect shall be
obtained. The applicant must obtain the municipal enabling Ordinance with the
required finding of special circumstances and present such municipal Ordinance
to the Board of Commissioners of Cook County prior to its determination as to
whether it will validate such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for
purposes of Class 8 and provide a County Resolution to that effect. A certified
copy of an Ordinance or Resolution finding that special circumstances exist, as
well as a certified copy of a County Ordinance or Resolution validating such a
finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 8 need not
be filed at the time of filing the Class 8 application with the Assessor, but must be
filed with the Assessor no later than the date an assessment appeal is filed to
request the class change to Class 8. If the Resolution is not filed at the time of the
Class 8 application, the applicant shall instead file, at that time, a letter from the
municipality or the County as the case may be, confirming that a Resolution or
Ordinance regarding special circumstances has been requested.
If the real estate is located within an Industrial Growth Zone, prior to filing a Class
8 eligibility application with the Assessor and in lieu of an Ordinance or
Resolution, an applicant may obtain from an authorized officer of the municipality
or an authorized officer of the Cook County Bureau of Economic Development if
the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, a letter stating that the
municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, supports and consents to the
filing of the Class 8 application with the Assessor. Such authorized officer shall
have been designated by the legislative body of the municipality or, in the case of
an unincorporated area, by the Cook County Board.
A copy of the authorized officer letter and a certified copy of the legislative action
designating the authorized officer shall be included with the Class 8 application
and submitted to the Cook County Bureau of Economic Development for
verification prior to filing of the application with the Assessor. The applicant must
demonstrate that the industrial development project qualifies for the Class 8
classification.
In addition, the letter from the authorized officer shall:
1.

Describe the redevelopment objective of the municipality;

2.

State the applicant's intended use of the property; and

3.

State that an Economic Disclosure Statement, as defined in this Division,
was received and filed by the municipality or County Board, as the case
may be.

 Following verification that the Class 8 application is in an Industrial Growth Zone
and has been properly submitted with a letter from an authorized officer and a
certified copy of the legislative action designating the authorized officer, the
Bureau of Economic Development will forward the application to the Assessor's
Office for filing.
Temporary Emergency Economic Recovery Modification (TEERM) Program: In
the instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property
as defined herein, the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may
still determine that special circumstances justify that the property is deemed
"abandoned" for purpose of Class 8 under the TEERM Program, if:
1.

There has been no purchase for value and the buildings; and

2.

The buildings and other structures have been vacant and unused for at least
12 continuous months.

The finding of abandonment, along with the specification of the special
circumstances, shall be included in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and
consenting to the Class 8 application under the TEERM Program.
In addition, the Ordinance or Resolution shall:
1.

Describe the redevelopment objective of the municipality;

2.

State the applicant's intended use of the property; and

3.

State that an Economic Disclosure Statement, as defined in this Division,
was received and filed by the municipality or County Board, as the case
may be.

If the Ordinance or Resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the County
Board is required to validate such, a finding that the property is deemed
"abandoned" for purposes of Class 8, and a Resolution to that effect shall be
obtained. The applicant must obtain the municipal enabling Ordinance with the
required finding of special circumstances and present such municipal Ordinance
to the Board of Commissioners of Cook County prior to its determination as to
whether it will validate such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for
purposes of Class 8 and provide a County Resolution to that effect. A certified
copy of an Ordinance or Resolution finding that special circumstances exist, as
well as a certified copy of a County Ordinance or Resolution validating such a
finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 8 need not
be filed at the time of filing the Class 8 application with the Assessor, but must be
filed with the Assessor no later than the date an assessment appeal is filed to
request the class change to Class 8. If the Resolution is not filed at the time of the
Class 8 application, the applicant shall instead file, at that time, a letter from the
municipality or the County as the case may be, confirming that a Resolution or
Ordinance regarding special circumstances has been requested.
Applications for the TEERM Program must be received by the Assessor's Office
on or before November 30, 2018, to receive consideration.

 Critical Emergency Employee Retention Modification (CEERM) Program: In the
instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as
defined herein, the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may still
determine that special circumstances justify finding that the property is deemed
"abandoned" for purpose of a Class 8 under the CEERM Program if:
1.

There has been no purchase for value; and

2.

The buildings and other structures have been vacant and unused for at least
3 continuous months; and

3.

The applicant has provided sufficient documentation to establish that such
applicant will create or maintain at least 250 jobs for employees at the
subject location. For purposes of this Section, the term "employee" shall
mean an individual who performs duties or services at the subject location
on average at least 30 hours per week in any two-week period for which
such individual is paid; "hours per week" shall mean hours for which an
individual is paid or entitled to payment for a period of time during which
no duties are performed by such individual due to vacation, holiday,
illness, incapacity, jury duty, military duty or approved leave of absence.

The finding of abandonment, along with the specification of the special
circumstances, and a determination that the applicant's participation in the CEERM
Program is necessary for the development to occur, and that without such
designation the industrial enterprise would not be economically viable causing the
property to be in imminent risk of remaining vacant and unused, shall be included
in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and consenting to the Class 8
application under the CEERM Program.
In addition, the Ordinance or Resolution where applicable shall:
1.

Describe the redevelopment objective of the municipality; and

2.

State the applicant’s intended use of the property; and

3.

State that an Economic Disclosure Statement, as defined in this Division,
was received and filed by the municipality or the County Board, as the
case may be

The CEERM Program shall be limited to the party who is the initial applicant of
the Class 8 incentive under the CEERM Program and the subject of the municipal
Resolution or Ordinance.

 If the Ordinance or Resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the County
Board is required to validate such a finding that the property is deemed
"abandoned" for purposes of Class 8, and a County Resolution to that effect shall
be obtained. The applicant must obtain the municipal enabling Ordinance with the
required finding of special circumstances and present such municipal Ordinance
to the Board of Commissioners of Cook County prior to its determination as to
whether it will validate such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for
purposes of Class 8 under the CEERM Program and provide a County Resolution
to that effect.
A certified copy of an Ordinance or Resolution finding that special circumstances
exist, as well as a certified copy of a County Ordinance or resolution validating
such a finding that the property is deemed “abandoned” for purposes of Class 8
need not be filed at the time of filing the Class 8 application with the Assessor,
but must be filed with the Assessor no later than the date an assessment appeal is
filed to request the class change to Class 8. If the Resolution is not filed at the time
of the Class 8 application, the applicant shall instead file, at that time, a letter from
the municipality or the County as the case may be, confirming that a Resolution or
Ordinance regarding special circumstances has been requested.
c.

A copy of the Resolution or letter confirming that a Resolution under the TEERM
Program or the CEERM Program, as the case may be, has been requested,
whichever is filed with the application, will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office
to the Secretary of the County Board for distribution to the members of the County
Board from the affected districts

d.

This classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the date of new
construction (excluding demolition, if any) or substantial rehabilitation was
completed and initially assessed, or in the case of abandoned property, from the
date of substantial re-occupancy, or in the case of incentives granted pursuant to
the TEERM Program or the CEERM Program from the date of the notice of
approval.

e.

Unless it was granted pursuant to the TEERM Program or the CEERM Program,
this incentive may be renewed during the last year a property is entitled to a tenpercent assessment level pursuant to Section 74-64(11), if the following
requirements are met:
1.

The taxpayer notifies the Assessor's Office of the taxpayer's intent to
request renewal of the incentive from the municipality, or the County
Board if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area;

2.

The municipality in which the real estate is located or the County Board,
if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, adopts a Resolution
expressly stating that the municipality or County Board, as the case may
be, has determined that the industrial or commercial use of the property is
necessary and beneficial to the local economy, and supports and consents
to renewal of the Class 8; and

 3.

(13)

A copy of that Resolution and a completed renewal application are filed
with the Assessor's Office before the expiration of the ten-percent
assessment level period.

f.

Class 8 incentives that are granted pursuant to the TEERM Program or the CEERM
Program are not renewable. For all other Class 8 incentives, the number of renewal
periods is not limited as long as the property continues to apply and meet the
requirements for Class 8.

g.

A copy of the request for renewal of the incentive will be forwarded by the
Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the County Board for distribution to the
members of the County Board from the affected districts.

h.

If no renewal is obtained, the incentive shall be phased out over the next two years,
pursuant to Section 74-64(11). After expiration of the last incentive period the real
estate shall revert to the applicable classification under this Division.

i.

The Assessor may adopt rules consistent with this subsection necessary to ensure
proper review of all factors relevant to determine eligibility for the benefits
provided under Class 8.

j.

The certification of an area as in need of substantial revitalization shall expire five
years from the date such certification is granted. The Assessor shall notify the
applicant of the date of expiration of certification one year before the date of the
expiration of the certification. Such certification, pursuant to the same criteria, may
be extended for one additional five-year period subject to reapplication by the
appropriate local governing body within the period from one year to six months
prior to the expiration of the initial five-year period.

k.

The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports
by all Class 8 recipients as to the use of the property and the number of persons
employed at the Class 8 site. A copy of such reports will be forwarded by the
Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the County Board for distribution to members
of the County Board from the affected districts. Failure to file such reports within
the time established by the Assessor's rules shall result in loss of the incentive for
the period relating to the non-filing.

provided that such real estate, consisting of land and existing buildings and structures is
multifamily residential real estate; either has undergone major rehabilitation, or is new

statement verifying continuous compliance with the Class 9 provisions of
this Division.

b.

No applicant shall discriminate on the basis of race, color, sex, marital status,
religion, national origin or ancestry, or on any other basis prohibited under Federal,
State or local law.

c.

Upon completion of the major rehabilitation, the applicant must supplement the
application by submitting evidence showing that major rehabilitation did, in fact,
occur, the date that the major rehabilitation was completed and that the real estate
complies with all applicable local building, safety and health requirements and
codes. Upon completion of the new construction, the applicant must supplement
the application by submitting an occupancy permit showing the date that the new
construction was completed and ready for occupancy, and evidence that the real

and codes.

d.

Beginning January 1, 2000, the Class 9 classification shall have an initial duration
of ten years from the date that the major rehabilitation was completed. That period
may be extended for additional ten-year periods if:
1.

An application is filed with the Assessor at least 12 months before the
expiration of the incentive period;

 e.

(14)

2.

The applicant presents evidence that the real estate currently complies with
all applicable local building, safety and health requirements and codes;
and

3.

The Assessor determines that all application qualifications, except the
major rehabilitation or new construction requirement, were maintained

When the Class 9 classification is due to expire or is terminated by action of the
owner or the Assessor, the property owner shall, in a manner and form determined
by the Assessor, notify all Class 9 tenants of the date of the termination of Class 9
classification. Once the Class 9 classification is terminated, the real estate shall

Class S. Real estate otherwise entitled to Class 3 classification under this division,
consisting of land and existing buildings and structures, which is has been subject to a
Section 8 contract renewal. The portion of the land and building eligible for the incentive
shall be in such proportion as the number of Section 8 units bears to the total number of
units. The proportion shall be applied only to property used for residential purposes, and
not to portions of the property, if any, used for commercial purposes.
a.

Property qualifies for the Class S classification if its Section 8 contract has been
renewed pursuant to one of the following alternatives:
1.

HUD has approved renewal of the Section 8 contract under the mark up to
market option, after finding that:
i.

The property has received a physical inspection score of at least
60, in an inspection by HUD's Real Estate Assessment Center,
confirming that the property is decent, safe, sanitary and in good
repair with no uncorrected exigent health and safety (EHS)
violations;

ii.

The property does not have a low- and moderate-income use
restriction that cannot be eliminated by unilateral action by the
owner. If, however, the current rent is lower than the use
restriction, HUD may use the mark up to market option to increase
the rents to the use restriction level, which would be a renewal
qualifying for the S classification; and

iii.

2.

A rent comparability study conducted by HUD has demonstrated
that comparable market rents are above 100 percent of the HUD
Fair Market Rent.
HUD has approved a contract renewal for five years of the Section 8
contract under the mark up to market under HUD's discretionary authority,
after finding that the property meets at least one of the required criteria:
i.

A vulnerable population is affected,

 3.

b.

ii.

There is a low vacancy rate in the area, which would make tenant
based assistance difficult to use, or a lack of comparable housing,
or

iii.

The project is a high priority for the local community, as
demonstrated by a contribution of state or local funds to the
property.

HUD has approved renewal of a Section 8 contract for a not for profit
corporation under any available option under HUD's renewal procedures
as described in HUD's Section 8 Renewal Policy Guidelines.

Additional requirements for qualification for the S classification are:
1.

At least 20 percent of the living units must be Section 8 units for qualifying
low- and moderate-income persons.

2.

The owner must agree to retain at least the existing number of Section 8
units for at least five years after the expiration of the expiring or expired
Section 8 contract.

3.

For the duration of the Class S classification period, applicant must file
annually with the Assessor, on or before a date determined by the
Assessor, a sworn statement verifying continuous compliance with the
Class S provisions of this Division.

4.

Applicant must agree to notify the Assessor's Office if the Section 8
contract is terminated prior to its expiration date. Applicant shall provide
to the Assessor's office a copy of any notice of default or notice of
abatement received from HUD.

c.

When the applicant applies to HUD for a contract renewal, no less than 120 days
prior to the expiration of the contract, the applicant shall notify the Assessor's
Office of the application, on a form provided by that office. Upon receiving
approval of the contract renewal from HUD, the applicant shall file an application
for the incentive with the Assessor's Office, on a form provided by that office. The
application shall be supported by a copy of HUD's letter approving the contract
renewal and a copy of the executed renewal contract.

d.

Any property which, as of November 23, 1999, has an existing Section 8 contract
with a mark up to market option may apply for Class S classification for the any
portion of the 2001 assessment year encompassed within the contract term, and for
the remainder of the contract term, including any renewals approved with the mark
up to market option. The classification shall continue until the expiration or
termination of the Section 8 contract.

 Any property which, as of (DATE AMENDMENT APPROVED), has an existing
Section 8 contract renewal may apply for Class S classification for any portion of
the 2006 assessment year encompassed within the contract term, and for the
remainder of the contract term, including any renewals approved with the mark up
to market option, mark up to market option under HUD's discretionary authority
or a Section 8 contract that has been renewed by a not-for-profit corporation under
any available option under HUD's renewal procedures as described in HUD's
Section 8 Renewal Policy Guidelines. The classification shall continue until the
expiration or termination of the Section 8 contract.

(15)

e.

The incentive may be renewed if the Section 8 contract is again renewed under any
of the following three options: 1) the mark up to market option; 2) the mark up to
market option under HUD's discretionary authority; or 3) by a not-for-profit
corporation under any available option under HUD's renewal procedures as
described in HUD's Section 8 Renewal Policy Guidelines. Upon filing an
application with HUD, no less than 120 days prior to termination of the contract,
for renewal of the Section 8 contract, the taxpayer shall provide notice to the
Assessor's Office of its application for renewal. The taxpayer shall provide a copy
to the Assessor's Office of HUD's approval of the contract renewal, or notification
of other action.

f.

The Assessor's Office shall adopt rules consistent with this subsection necessary
to ensure proper review of all factors relevant to determine initial and continued
eligibility for the benefits provided under Class S.

Class L. Real estate which is to be used for commercial or industrial purposes and which
is designated as Class 3, Class 4, Class 5a or Class 5b pursuant to this Division; is a
landmark or contributing building; and has undergone substantial rehabilitation. The
substantial rehabilitation must constitute an investment by the owner of at least 50 percent
of the building's full market value as determined by the Assessor in the assessment year
prior to the commencement of the substantial rehabilitation.
a.

Generally, the incentive shall apply only to the building and will not apply to the
land underneath the building. However, if the entire building has been vacant and
unused for at least 24 continuous months prior to the filing of the eligibility
application with the Assessor, the land upon which the building is situated shall
also be eligible for the incentive.

b.

Prior to filing a Class L eligibility application with the Assessor, an applicant must
obtain an Ordinance or Resolution from the unit of local government in which the
real estate is located, which expressly states that the local government:
1.

Has determined that the incentive provided by Class L is necessary for the
substantial rehabilitation of the property;

2.

Supports and consents to the granting of the incentive; and

 3.

Has reviewed and accepted its preservation commission's written
recommendation of the project for the Class L incentive. This
recommendation will specify the project's budget and proposed scope of
work and will specify that the project will meets or exceeds the Standards
of the United States Department of the Interior for Rehabilitation,
Preservation, Restoration, and Reconstruction of historic properties.

4.

In addition, the Ordinance or Resolution shall:
i.

Describe the redevelopment objective of the municipality;

ii.

State the applicant's intended use of the property; and

iii.

State that an Economic Disclosure Statement, as defined in this
Division, was received and filed by the municipality or County
Board, as the case may be.

c.

A certified copy of the Ordinance or Resolution need not be filed with the Assessor
at the time the Class L eligibility application is filed but the Ordinance or
Resolution must be filed with the Assessor no later than the date an assessment
appeal is filed to request the class change to Class L.

d.

If the Ordinance or Resolution is not filed at the time of the eligibility application
is filed, the applicant shall instead, include the following items with the eligibility
application:
1.

A letter from the municipality or the County, as the case may be,
confirming that a Resolution or Ordinance supporting the incentive has
been requested; and

2.

A copy of the preservation commission's recommendation of the project.

e.

A copy of the Resolution or letter confirming that a Resolution has been requested,
whichever is filed with the application, will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office
to the Secretary of the Board for distribution to the members of the County Board
from the affected districts.

f.

Additionally, to qualify a landmark building or contributing building for Class L
classification, an eligibility application must be made to the Assessor within one
year prior to the commencement of substantial rehabilitation. After the substantial
rehabilitation has been completed, the preservation commission shall review the
project to determine that it is eligible under Subsection (14) of this Section. The
applicant must supplement the eligibility application with a copy of the
determination of the preservation commission prior to classification of the real
estate as Class L.

g.

The initial Class L classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the
date such substantial rehabilitation was completed and initially assessed.

 h.

For property which was initially classified as Class 3, 4 or 5b, this incentive may
be renewed during the last year a property is entitled to a 16-percent assessment
level, if the following requirements are met:
1.

The taxpayer notifies the Assessor's Office of the taxpayer's intent to
request renewal of the incentive from the municipality, or the County
Board if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area;

2.

The municipality in which the real estate is located or the County Board,
if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, adopts a resolution
expressly stating that the municipality or County Board, as the case may
be, has determined that the industrial use of the property is necessary and
beneficial to the local economy, and supports and consents to renewal of
the Class L; and

3.

A copy of that Resolution and a completed renewal application are filed
with the Office of the Assessor before the expiration of the incentive
period.

The number of renewal periods is not limited as long as the property continues to
apply and qualify for Class L. The notice of intent to request renewal which is filed
with the Assessor's Office will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the
Secretary of the County Board for distribution to members of the County Board
from the affected districts.
i.

If, as of November 23, 1999, a property is receiving Class L treatment, but the
assessment level is higher than 16 percent, that taxpayer may apply for renewal as
outlined above and receive a 16-percent assessment level for the prescribed period
beginning after the filing and approval of the Resolution and renewal application.
However, if as of the effective date, the taxpayer's assessment is higher than 16
percent and the taxpayer is granted a renewal of the incentive for subsequent years,
no reduction of the current assessment level based on renewal of the incentive will
be granted. If no renewal is obtained, the incentive shall be phased out over the
next two years, pursuant to Section 74-64. After expiration of the last incentive
period, the real estate shall revert to the applicable classification under this
Division.

j.

For commercial properties, once the original 12-year incentive period has expired,
the commercial Class L incentive will expire. The incentive classification will be
subject to renewal subject to subsection (h).

k.

The Assessor shall adopt rules consistent with the foregoing necessary to ensure
proper review of all factors relevant to determine initial and continued eligibility
for the benefits provided under Class L.

l.

The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports
by all Class L recipients as to the continued landmark status of the property and
the number of persons employed at the Class L site. Failure to file such reports
within the time established by the Assessor's rules may result in loss of the
incentive for the period relating to the non-filing.

 m.

(16)

The Assessor shall provide the Chairman of the Business and Economic
Development Committee of the Cook County Board, annually on or before
December 1, a report of each Class L that was designated in the prior year. Such
report shall consist of the address of the Class L designated property, the date such
designation was granted, the amount of property taxes that were not assessed each
year during which the Class L incentive was in effect for such property, and if
provided by the applicant, the aggregate amount of the investment in the project
and the number of jobs generated in connection with such project.
