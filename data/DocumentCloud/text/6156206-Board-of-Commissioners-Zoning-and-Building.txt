FROM:

RE:

Donald H. Wlodarski
Commissioner

Appeal by the Zoning Administrator to the Cook County Board of Commissioners
regarding the Zoning Board of Appeals' decision to overturn the ruling of the Zoning
Administrator per Appeal Docket No. 001-02-2020, Appeal Docket No. 001-03-2002 and
Appeal Docket No. 001-04-2002 in unincorporated Barrington Township.

Pursuant to the Cook County Zoning Ordinance, Article 13.3.5, I respectfully request that the January
15, 2003, decision of the Zoning Board of Appeals be heard upon the record of the Zoning and Building
Committee of the Cook County Board of Commissioners. The applicants were aggrieved by a decision,
by the Zoning Administrator regarding permit applications for single-family homes on parcels that are
deemed "Environmentally Sensitive" by the Cook County Comprehensive Land Use and Policies Plan.
We ask that the Cook County Board of Commissioners reverse the ruling of the Zoning Board of
Appeals after holding an appropriate hearing on this matter. Thank you.

* The next regularly scheduled meeting is presently set for Thursday, March 06, 2003.
