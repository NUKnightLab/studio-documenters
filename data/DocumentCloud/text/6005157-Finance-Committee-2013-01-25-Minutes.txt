IV. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
A. Financial Reports – November 2012 and December 2012 (Attachment #4)
This item was taken out of order.
Dorothy Loving, System Executive Director of Finance, presented the Financial Reports for the period through
December 2012. The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
Director Michael inquired further regarding collections. He stated that the $4 million that the System received
from the Upper Payment Limit (UPL) is great, but if it had not been for that, the System would have actually
had a deficit of $1 million for the month. Mr. Cookinham responded that the System had planned to start
receiving 1115 Waiver per-member per-month (PMPM) money in February; this was started a little later than
anticipated. Part of what was experienced in December and January is the loss of processing time from the
holidays, both in terms of processing at the System and at the State and third-party level. Additionally, every
time the System receives a retroactive payment, like the UPL adjustment or any of the other rate changes, the
State has to reprocess many claims, which interferes with the current business activities; it is expected that this
will pick up in the next several months. He added that there have also been some difficulties experienced with
the installation of a new pharmacy system.
Director Michael stated that one of the things that was not evident was how much of the expense in December
would be attributable to the 1115 Waiver activities. Mr. Cookinham responded that, with regard to the expense
attributable to the Waiver activities, for some of the activities, the initial invoices have not yet been processed,
so he was unsure of that amount relating to the December expenses. He added that much of the expenses are or
will be based on the number of people who are enrolled.
Mr. Cookinham noted that, as previously discussed, staff is working on a monthly report that segregates the
Waiver revenue and expenses. A couple of positive outcomes that have resulted from the negotiations is that
the administrative expenses are to be paid separately from the PMPM amounts, and regarding the retroactive
billing of Medicaid.
Board Chairman Carvalho made the following request with regard to the presentation of the financial reports to
the Committee in the future: incorporated into the financial reports should be a page or two of the
methodology that spreads expenses and revenues, so that when one looks at the numbers to date, they can get a
more accurate picture of what is going on. For the first eleven months for the financials, there are numbers on
the page and then there are explanations that are only heard orally that explain the whole picture.
Chairman O’Donnell inquired regarding the review of potential opportunities to reduce expenses, as it relates
to the financial reports. Mr. Cookinham responded that one of the issues with this is due to the way the County
pays and keeps track of expenses. An appropriation trial balance is received from the County on a monthly
basis that shows what has been encumbered and what has been spent; because it is not an accrual-based
system, where liability is recorded when an invoice is received, it is a little more difficult to divide it up into
monthly kinds of numbers. He noted that savings can be achieved on the supply chain side, when staff is able
to identify at that point to utilize the group purchasing organization (GPO) or get better contract prices. The
month-to-month reporting is more difficult based on their current tools.

IV. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
A. Financial Reports (continued)
Chairman O’Donnell stated that the Board wants the financial reports to be useful to the Board and
management, to be able to examine where improvement is needed and where success is achieved. She stated
that there is a need for the proper tools to be in place, and the ability to track revenue as well as expenses, so
that opportunities for further savings can be targeted.
Board Chairman Carvalho elaborated further on that point, regarding the need for managers to have this
information, in order to manage. He noted that yesterday at a City Club of Chicago event, Dr. Ram Raju,
Chief Executive Officer, delivered a speech that talked about the fundamental changes in the way the System
deliver cares that are required to be successful. That led Board Chairman Carvalho to think about some of the
fundamental ways that the System needs to think differently about how it manages its financial affairs.
Currently, a manager is successful if he or she keeps their expenditures under appropriation. They are
unsuccessful if they go over appropriation and need a transfer; however, even that unsuccessful activity still
has a way to fix it. This needs to be transformed so that the successful manager is the one who does not come
anywhere close to spending the appropriation.
Director Michael indicated that he would feel more comfortable if the System was collecting cash in excess of
the budget amounts per month, consistently on a monthly basis. He noted that in 2012, the System consistently
ran under what was expected to be collected on Medicaid, Medicare and physician billing. Now with the
Waiver piece coming in as well, that compounds the issue. Mr. Cookinham agreed. He stated that the
administration has recognized that the performance with regard to collections has been less what it should be;
however, he noted that it is better that it has been in the past.
Mr. Oder noted that he is used to reviewing financial statements compared to budget. He agreed that it is
important to get this information on an actual basis. He added that the whole year seems to be wrapped up in
the revenue relating to CountyCare; therefore, it is really crucial that the Finance Committee and Board receive
a monthly budget on CountyCare to show how this builds up.
Director Michael noted that, apart from the Waiver, the expenses budgeted for this year are actually lower than
they were in 2012. The team has done a good job managing expenses down, apart from the Waiver; the key is,
are the expenditures from the Waiver going to be in control and in line with what is collected as a result of that
program? A focus on that piece, in the monthly reports on the Waiver activity, including both expense and
revenue, is very important.
B. Update on the following projects:
i. Section 1115 Medicaid Waiver Demonstration Project / CountyCare
Ms. Greene provided an update on the Section 1115 Medicaid Waiver Demonstration Project/CountyCare.
She stated that, starting February 1st, CountyCare will have its first members – for the first time these members
will have access to health care services that were previously unavailable to them, such as behavioral health
services and substance abuse services.
In addition to on-boarding the vendors and primary care partners, Managed Care has conducted four training
sessions for application assisters, has held numerous presentations to advocacy and community groups, and has
held the first weekly webinar session with the primary care partners, including Ambulatory and Community
Health Network of Cook County (ACHN) clinicians.

IV. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
B. Update on the following projects:
i. Section 1115 Medicaid Waiver Demonstration Project / CountyCare (continued)
As of this week, nearly 6,000 applications have been initiated; for these applications, the System is waiting on
the applicant to provide the required documentation. Of those, approximately 15% have been submitted to the
Illinois Department of Human Services (DHS), to be adjudicated. While the official monthly transmission has
not yet been received from the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services (HFS) on the approvals,
the unofficial numbers from DHS reflect that the approval rate is at 90%.
One of the outreach strategies that is being used is a type of automated phone system that generates calls to
potential eligible persons from a targeted group. Ms. Greene provided information on some of the results of
this strategy, focused upon persons from the database that were identified as most likely to be eligible, based
on age, income, etc.; she added that these are people who have received care in the ACHN General Medicine
Clinic. Approximately 13% of the phones were disconnected, based on the last known phone number of the
person. 43% of the time, a message was left for the person. 17% of the calls resulted in no answer. 26% of
those called were successfully contacted and screened for eligibility. 46% of those screened were not eligible
for CountyCare. 67% of those screened as potentially eligible declined to continue with the application.
On the subject of those potentially eligible persons who declined to apply, Board Chairman Carvalho stated
that the System needs to develop a “Plan B”. Plan A would be to educate and convince potential enrollees;
Plan B would tie consequences to those who are eligible but who will not enroll. Plan B would not
automatically be implemented, but it would stand at the ready for implementation if it is determined that Plan
A is not working. Simply relying on the good will of people to enroll because it is good for the System is not
guaranteed to be successful. The continued viability of the System depends on this program working; there
needs to be something built in to compel or incentivize people to enroll. He noted that discussions have been
held on changing the culture for the staff, and discussions need to be held about changing the culture for the
patient, too.
The Committee further discussed strategy and outreach plans; it was noted that contractual proposals for
communication and outreach activities were considered earlier in the meeting and were recommended for
approval. Based on this discussion, Director Michael requested that the work plans that are proposed as part of
the contractual arrangement for outreach efforts (request number 8 under Item III(B) – Contracts and
Procurement Items) be provided to the Board for their information in advance of the February 1, 2013 Board
Meeting. He added that he would like to have answers to the following questions: What are the other
programs that are part of this outreach campaign? When will enough data be compiled in order to see the
success rate for each of those programs under the outreach campaign?
ii. Global Healthcare Exchange (GHX) contract management /
electronic exchange system
Ms. Besenhofer provided a brief update on the implementation of the GHX system. She stated that the system
went live on January 7, 2013. She stated that this process has been a huge undertaking; she thanked all of
those who were involved in the implementation.

iii. Meaningful Use
An update on Meaningful Use will be provided at the next Finance Committee Meeting from Dr. Bala Hota, System
Interim Chief Information Officer.

VI.

Report from Chief Financial Officer (Attachment #5)
This item was taken out of order.
Mr. Cookinaham presented his report, which included an update on revenue. The Committee reviewed and
discussed the information.
Director Michael inquired regarding the factors that may have contributed to the decline in inpatient volume by
19% from 2010, as reflected in Mr. Cookinham’s report. He noted that there may perhaps be several factors
contributing to the decline; however, he inquired whether one of the factors may have been due to reasons relating
to patient satisfaction.
Dr. Raju stated that patient satisfaction is always something that the administration is concerned about. He noted
that there are two main goals that are of top priority: 1) enrolling the people in CountyCare; and 2) keep the
patients happy so they will stay with CountyCare. He added that there a number of initiatives in place to address
patient satisfaction.
With regard to the subject of the decline in inpatient volume, Dr. Raju noted that it is a positive trend to increase
outpatient volume and decrease inpatient volume. Mr. Cookinham provided additional information on possible
factors that could have contributed to the decline. In that period of time, Oak Forest Hospital was transitioned from
an inpatient facility to an outpatient facility, and Provident Hospital was reduced to operating twenty-five beds.
Director Michael stated that, given the decline, it appears that the System has done well from a financial
standpoint. Chairman O’Donnell noted that, because these documents are publicly available, when a significant
decline like this is reflected, an explanation for the decline should be provided in the materials.

VII. Adjourn
As the agenda was exhausted, Chairman O’Donnell declared the meeting ADJOURNED.

A combination of testing services will be used. It will include laboratory and portable testing for inpatients and
outpatients. Adding portable testing decreases cost and reduces the wait time for steep testing and treatment for the
patients in greatest need. Using a combination of portable and laboratory sleep tests will allow the Division to increase
total potential capacity by 35% without increasing the total contract cost from the prior three year period. The cost Of
leaving this population untreated is an increased number of admissions to the hospital and our intensive care units for
.- heert failure, respiratory failure and cor-pulmonale.

Subject: Action Items C.
Lease Schedules under replacement Master Lease Agreement with Banc of America
Leasing Corp and Capital Corp., LLC

In August 2010, pursuant to the authorization by this Board, the entered into a replacement
Master Lease Agreement with Banc of America Leasing and Capital Corp., LLC (?Banc of America?) for the
purposes of leasing capital equipment beginning in 2010. Under the Master Lease the parties may enter
into Lease Schedules with respect to specific items of equipment to be leased.

Under the Master Lease, the interest rate for each Lease Schedule is based upon the three?year United
States Treasury Maturity SWAP rate. The amounts payable under each lease schedule may therefore vary
depending upon changes in this indicator.

We are requesting your authorization to enter into and execute additional lease schedules and related
agreements, as required, to permit to lease the equipment listed on the FY 2013 List of Proposed
Banc of America Equipment (Covered Equipment Attachment) attached to this memorandum.

The estimated maximum acquisition cost for the items on the Covered Equipment Attachment is
$11,951,398.14. This equipment will be leased pursuant to one or more lease schedules under the
replacement Master Lease Agreement. The lease schedules shall have terms of 60 months and
interest shall be based on the then-current SWAP rate. In the event Banc of America is required
to make certain interim payments to the manufacturer at the time of the purchase and equipment
delivery, a related agreement will be entered into with Banc of America, in addition to the
applicable Lease Schedule, or will be included in the amounts due under the applicable lease
schedule at the rate of PRIME minus 

Under the lease schedules, control and use of the equipment will rest entirely with the Health System.
The equipment is being acquired by Banc of America based on the Health 5 stem? .ons and

acquisition pricing secured by the Health System. APPR VED

 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
INTRODUCTION
This discussion and analysis provides the readers of the monthly unaudited financial
statements of the Cook County Health and Hospital System (CCHHS) with an overview
of the financial activities for the month ended December 31, 2012. This discussion
focuses on the significant financial issues and major financial activities during the current
month. It should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements of
the CCHHS.
The CCHHS includes the following entities: John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital (JSH), Oak
Forest Health Center (OFC) Provident Hospital (PHCC), the Department of Public Health
(DPH), the Ambulatory and Community Health Network (ACHN), the Bureau of Health
Services (BHS), CORE Center (for reporting purposes part of Stroger Hospital), and
Cermak Health Services (CHS). Starting this fiscal year 2013, we have added the 1115
Waiver. Collectively, these entities provide primary, intermediate, acute, and tertiary
medical care to patients, without regard to their ability to pay. The Bureau of Health
Services oversees the operational, planning, and policy activities of the CCHHS.
The CCHHS is included in the reporting entity of the Cook County, Illinois, as an
enterprise fund. As an enterprise fund, the CCHHS’ financial statements are prepared
using proprietary fund accounting that focuses on the determination of changes in net
assets, financial position, and cash flows in a manner similar to private sector businesses.
The financial statements are prepared on an accrual basis of accounting, which
recognizes revenue when earned and expenses when incurred.
In 2008 the Cook County Health and Hospital System Board was created by the Cook
County Board of Commissioners to provide independent oversight of health care
operations, and in 2010 the Cook County Board of Commissioners voted to make the
Cook County Health and Hospital System Board permanent.
In 2010 the Cook County Health and Hospital System Board and the Cook County Board
of Commissioners approved Vision 2015 Strategic Plan, which outlines, over five years,
restructuring CCHHS to deliver the best possible care for the vulnerable population of
Cook County within the constraints of dollar resources available to the health system.
This plan seeks to better allocate resources.
In 2012 the Cook County Health and Hospitals System and Cook County Board Officials
collaborated to cut Medicaid costs, help county taxpayers, and transform Cook County’s
hospital system by jump-starting national health care reform in Cook County. In October,
2012 the federal governmnent approved the 1115 Medicaid Waiver for Cook County,
allowing CCHHS to enroll more than 115,000 individuals who will be eligible for
Medicaid in 2014 into a Cook County network with no cost to the state of Illinois.
An 1115 Waiver allows the Cook County’s Health System to early enroll certain
uninsured patients into Medicaid. Specifically, these are patients who are not currently
5
Page 38 of 112

 eligible for Medicaid, but who will be eligible in 2014 under the Accountable Care Act.
Many of these individuals are patients who already are being treated by our system
without compensation. The Waiver is funded entirely by the federal government.

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS (IN THOUSANDS)
The Cook County Health and Hospitals System finished the month with overall revenue
of $49,110 and overall expenses was $75,820.
Net Patient revenue for the month was $31,176.
Net Patient revenue consists of all charges including automated contractual allowances
and bad debt adjustments. Write-off of Bad Debt is a CCHHS Board approved policy.
Other revenue was $204. Other revenue consists primarily of parking revenue.

Patient Accounts Receivable – BEPA System Only
General
As compared to November 30, 2012, Total Patient Accounts Receivable at the end of
December-2012 reduced by 6 to 116 days. The 6 day decrease in this figure, as
compared to the previous month’s figure, is due largely to the continued implementation
of the following factors:




Movement of accounts with undeliverable addresses to the collection agency;
Correction of pharmacy charging issues; and
Transition of patients previously covered under the LOL program to the Carelink
program.

Days of Revenue Outstanding measures the average number of days charges remain in
accounts receivable after service has been rendered before collection activities have been
completed, including charity care and bad debt write-offs. Days of Revenue Outstanding
is measured in charges, not cash collections.
Days of Revenue Outstanding is a useful tool to measure collection efforts over time (i.e.,
whether this number is growing or decreasing). This number will be large due to the
large number of Self-Pay patients CCHHS services and the processes CCHHS must
complete before patient accounts are collected or written-off to bad debt. These
processes include, but are not limited to, the following:






Making an effort to attain third-party insurance coverage;
Processing charity care applications;
Sending three (3) monthly statements before accounts are turned over to
collections;
Placing accounts bi-monthly with the collection agency; and
Permitting patients to pay their account balances over time (time payment).

6
Page 39 of 112

 Total billed accounts fell by $7.644M (2.6%) as compared to the November-2012
balance. This figure has declined in ten (10) out of the last eleven (11) months. The
overall decline in this figure indicates an increasing number of accounts are completing
the collection process, which includes charity care and bad debt write-offs.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts, as
Medicaid pays CCHHS claims on a per-diem and Medicare pays CCHHS on the
diagnosis, regardless of charges on the patient accounts. Additionally, charity care and
bad debt write-offs will not result in actual cash collections.
Inpatient Accounts Receivable – BEPA System Only
Discharged Not Final Billed
Inpatient discharged but not final billed accounts at the end of December-2012 decreased
by $0.342M (3.9%) as compared the November 30, 2012 balance. This indicates that
more inpatient accounts are moving to a “Billed” status, as compared to the previous
month.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts, as
Medicaid pays CCHHS’ claims on a per-diem and Medicare pays CCHHS’ claims on the
diagnosis, regardless of charges on the patient accounts. Additionally, charity care and
bad debt write-offs are part of the collection process and will not result in actual cash
collections.
Billed Inpatient Accounts
Billed inpatient accounts at the end of December-2012 decreased by $3.217M (2.1%) as
compared to the November 30, 2012 balance.
The decrease in this number indicates more accounts had the collection process
completed than in the previous month and that more accounts are being removed from
active accounts receivable. CCHHS’ collection process includes charity care and bad
debt write-offs.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts, as
Medicaid pays on a per-diem and Medicare pays on the diagnosis, regardless of charges
on the patient accounts. Additionally, charity care and bad debt write-offs will not result
in actual cash collections.
Outpatient Accounts Receivable – BEPA System Only
Unbilled Outpatient Accounts
The balance of unbilled outpatient accounts increased by $1.020M (5.9%) by the end of
December-2012, as compared to the level of unbilled accounts as of November 30, 2012.
Fewer outpatient accounts are moving to a “Billed” status, as compared to the previous
month.
7
Page 40 of 112

 The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts due
to Medicaid’s and Medicare’s reimbursement configuration.
Billed Outpatient Accounts
The billed outpatient accounts receivable at the end of December-2012 fell by $4.427M
(3.2%) over the balance as of November 30, 2012.
The reduction in this figure, as compared to the prior month’s balance, indicates a greater
number of Out-Patient accounts had their collection and write-off related activities
completed.
The reduction of internal bill-holds from 20 days to 6 days will tend to cause a growth in
the billed accounts receivable.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts due
to Medicaid and Medicare’s reimbursement configuration and to charity care and bad
debt write-offs.
Carelink Program Activities (Charity Care)
The volume and dollar amounts written-off to charity care are as follows:

 Nonoperating Revenue was $17.730M. The largest portions of this are attributed to sales
tax in the amount of $5.863M and property tax in the amount of $7.352M. As of report
date, Cook County has not recorded the cigarette tax revenue for the month of December.
Sales tax revenues are recognized by CCHHS when earned; this occurs when the
underlying sales transactions occur. The amount recorded as Due from State of Illinois Sales Tax represents the amounts earned by CCHHS, however, the cash is not yet
received from the state. There is a 3 months lag from the time of the underlying sales
transaction to the receipt of funds.
Taxes collected for the Health to date have been fully credited to the Health Fund except
as mentioned in the previous paragraph.
OVERVIEW OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
This discussion and analysis are intended to serve as an introduction to the CCHHS
financial statements. CCHHS basic monthly unaudited financial statements are comprised
of fund financial statements.
A fund is a grouping of related accounts that is used to maintain control over resources
that have been segregated for specific activities or objectives. The CCHHS, like other
state and local governments, uses fund accounting to ensure and demonstrate compliance
with finance-related legal requirements.

Vendor Payments From Revenue are payments out of revenue posted by the County Comptroller. Pharmacy Billing and Revenue Enhancement
payments are reductions to Medicaid revenue. Collection Agency payments are reductions to Self-Pay (Other) revenue. Physician Billing payments

 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
INTRODUCTION
This discussion and analysis provides the readers of the monthly unaudited financial
statements of the Cook County Health and Hospital System (CCHHS) with an overview
of the financial activities for the month ended November 30, 2012. This discussion
focuses on the significant financial issues and major financial activities during the current
month. It should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements of
the CCHHS.
The CCHHS includes the following entities: John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital (JSH), Oak
Forest Health Center (OFC) Provident Hospital (PHCC), the Department of Public Health
(DPH), the Ambulatory and Community Health Network (ACHN), the Bureau of Health
Services (BHS), CORE Center (for reporting purposes part of Stroger Hospital), and
Cermak Health Services (CHS). Collectively, these entities provide primary,
intermediate, acute, and tertiary medical care to patients, without regard to their ability to
pay. The Bureau of Health Services oversees the operational, planning, and policy
activities of the CCHHS.
The CCHHS is included in the reporting entity of the Cook County, Illinois, as an
enterprise fund. As an enterprise fund, the CCHHS’ financial statements are prepared
using proprietary fund accounting that focuses on the determination of changes in net
assets, financial position, and cash flows in a manner similar to private sector businesses.
The financial statements are prepared on an accrual basis of accounting, which
recognizes revenue when earned and expenses when incurred.
In 2008 the Cook County Health and Hospital System Board was created by the Cook
County Board of Commissioners to provide independent oversight of health care
operations, and in 2010 the Cook County Board of Commissioners voted to make the
Cook County Health and Hospital System Board permanent.
In 2010 the Cook County Health and Hospital System Board and the Cook County Board
of Commissioners approved Vision 2015 Strategic Plan, which outlines, over five years,
restructuring CCHHS to deliver the best possible care for the vulnerable population of
Cook County within the constraints of dollar resources available to the health system.
This plan seeks to better allocate resources.

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS (IN THOUSANDS)
The Cook County Health and Hospitals System finished the twelve months with overall
revenue of $896,591 and overall expenses was $929,887.
Net Patient revenue for the twelve months was $577,856.

Page 73 of 112

 Net Patient revenue consists of all charges including automated contractual allowances
and bad debt adjustments. Write-off of Bad Debt is a CCHHS Board approved policy.
Other revenue was $7,939. Other revenue consists primarily of parking revenue.

Patient Accounts Receivable – BEPA System Only
General
As compared to November 30, 2011, Total Patient Accounts Receivable at the end of
November-2012 reduced by 32 to 122 days. The 1 day decrease in this figure, as
compared to the previous month’s figure, is due largely to the continued implementation
of the following factors:




Movement of accounts with undeliverable addresses to the collection agency;
Correction of pharmacy charging issues; and
Transition of patients previously covered under the LOL program to the Carelink
program.

Days of Revenue Outstanding measures the average number of days charges remain in
accounts receivable after service has been rendered before collection activities have been
completed, including charity care and bad debt write-offs. Days of Revenue Outstanding
is measured in charges, not cash collections.
Days of Revenue Outstanding is a useful tool to measure collection efforts over time (i.e.,
whether this number is growing or decreasing). This number will be large due to the
large number of Self-Pay patients CCHHS services and the processes CCHHS must
complete before patient accounts are collected or written-off to bad debt. These
processes include, but are not limited to, the following:






Making an effort to attain third-party insurance coverage;
Processing charity care applications;
Sending three (3) monthly statements before accounts are turned over to
collections;
Placing accounts bi-monthly with the collection agency; and
Permitting patients to pay their account balances over time (time payment).

Total billed accounts fell by $59.341M (16.8%) as compared to the November-2011
balance and also fell by $13.893M (4.5%) as compared to the prior month’s balance.
This figure has declined in nine (9) out of the last ten (10) months. The overall decline in
this figure indicates an increasing number of accounts are completing the collection
process.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts, as
Medicaid pays CCHHS claims on a per-diem and Medicare pays CCHHS on the
diagnosis, regardless of charges on the patient accounts. Additionally, charity care and
bad debt write-offs will not result in actual cash collections.

 Inpatient Accounts Receivable – BEPA System Only
Discharged Not Final Billed
Inpatient discharged but not final billed accounts at the end of November-2012 decreased
by $12.363M (58.3%) as compared the November 30, 2011 balance. This amount is less
than the previous month’s balance by $0.535M (5.7%) as well. This indicates that more
inpatient accounts are moving to a “Billed” status, as compared to the previous month.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts, as
Medicaid pays CCHHS’ claims on a per-diem and Medicare pays CCHHS’ claims on the
diagnosis, regardless of charges on the patient accounts. Additionally, charity care and
bad debt write-offs are part of the collection process and will not result in actual cash
collections.
Billed Inpatient Accounts
Billed inpatient accounts at the end of November-2012 decreased by $36.670M (19.0%)
as compared to the November 30, 2011 balance. This amount is also less than the
previous month’s balance by $9.749M (5.9%).
The decrease in this number indicates more accounts had the collection process
completed than in the previous month and that more accounts are being removed from
active accounts receivable. CCHHS’ collection process includes charity care and bad
debt write-offs.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts, as
Medicaid pays on a per-diem and Medicare pays on the diagnosis, regardless of charges
on the patient accounts. Additionally, charity care and bad debt write-offs will not result
in actual cash collections.
Outpatient Accounts Receivable – BEPA System Only
Unbilled Outpatient Accounts
The balance of unbilled outpatient accounts decreased by $5.018M (22.5%) by the end of
November-2012, as compared to the level of unbilled accounts as of November 30, 2011.
This month’s balance decreased by $1.039M (5.7%). More outpatient accounts are
moving to a “Billed” status, as compared to the previous month. The reduction of
internal bill-holds from 20 days to 6 days will tend to cause a decline in the unbilled
accounts receivable.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts due
to Medicaid’s and Medicare’s reimbursement configuration.
Billed Outpatient Accounts
The billed outpatient accounts receivable at the end of November-2012 fell by $22.671M
(14.1%) over the balance as of November 30, 2011. This figure is smaller than the
previous month’s balance by $4.144M (2.9%).

Page 75 of 112

 The reduction in this figure, as compared to the prior month’s balance, indicates a greater
number of Out-Patient accounts had their collection and write-off related activities
completed.
The reduction of internal bill-holds from 20 days to 6 days will tend to cause a growth in
the billed accounts receivable.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts due
to Medicaid and Medicare’s reimbursement configuration and to charity care and bad
debt write-offs.

Operating Expenses at the end of twelve months was $929.887M broken down as
follows:
Salaries and Wages - $498.809M
Benefits - $134.599M
Supplies - $102.691M.
Purchased Services, Rental, and Other - $135.485M
Depreciation - $30.043M
Utilities - $12.311M
Insurance - $12.701M
Services Provided by Other County Offices - $3.247
The various decreases in the month of November for benefits, depreciation and insurance
expenses are the result of adjusting previous months estimates to actual. In November,
we recorded a transfer of $3.247M for services provided by other County Offices.

Page 76 of 112

 Nonoperating Revenue was $310.795M. The largest portions of this are attributed to
sales tax in the amount of $57.895M, cigarette tax in the amount of $106.004M and
property tax in the amount of $80.689M. The decrease of $10.154M in sales tax revenue
for the month of November is the difference between the reversal of last year’s and the
provision for current year’s accrual at a lower allocation rate. Sales tax revenues are
recognized by CCHHS when earned; this occurs when the underlying sales transactions
occur. The amount recorded as Due from State of Illinois - Sales Tax represents the
amounts earned by CCHHS, however, the cash is not yet received from the state. There is
a 3 months lag from the time of the underlying sales transaction to the receipt of funds.
Taxes collected for the Health to date have been fully credited to the Health Fund except
as mentioned in the previous paragraph.
OVERVIEW OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
This discussion and analysis are intended to serve as an introduction to the CCHHS
financial statements. CCHHS basic monthly unaudited financial statements are comprised
of fund financial statements.
A fund is a grouping of related accounts that is used to maintain control over resources
that have been segregated for specific activities or objectives. The CCHHS, like other
state and local governments, uses fund accounting to ensure and demonstrate compliance
with finance-related legal requirements.

The Medicaid fee-for-service revenue through the IGT covers the period beginning week ended 09/19/2012 - 10/17/2012 .
Vendor Payments From Revenue are payments out of revenue posted by the County Comptroller. Pharmacy Billing and Revenue Enhancement
payments are reductions to Medicaid revenue. Collection Agency payments are reductions to Self-Pay (Other) revenue. Physician Billing payments
include refunds processed by CCHHS. Included in the "Revenue Enhancement" total is a payment to the state for supplemental workers
hired to help clear the Medicaid backlog.
The Upper Payment Limit Revision is spread over 11 months, beginning Jan-2012, as it is not known in which month this payment will be received.
The "Medicaid Retroactive Payment" was budgeted all at SHCC.
