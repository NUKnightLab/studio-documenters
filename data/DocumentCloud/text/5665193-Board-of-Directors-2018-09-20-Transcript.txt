Board Member

Thank you,

Pursuant to Section 2-78-130 of

8

the Municipal Code of Chicago, I considered one

9

matter on which the Chief Administrator of the

10

Civilian Office of Police Accountability and

11

the Superintendent of Police did not agree

12

regarding the discipline of a police officer.

13

Request for review number 18 RR

14

04 involves allegations that Police Officer

15

Kevin Lott used excessive force and made a

16

false statement to COPA.

17

The Chief Administrator

18

recommended sustaining these allegations and

19

discharging the officer from the Chicago Police

20

Department.

21

classifying these allegations as Unfounded.

22

The Superintendent recommended

After reviewing this matter, I

23

find the Superintendent met the burden of

overcoming the Chief Administrator's

Hi, I'm Ellen Corley.

I've spoken here before.

I've been a member of

the Chicago Alliance Against Racist Political

21

group that was started 45 years ago by Angela

the -- it's not independent.

Richard Daley, you know, appoints this, right?

7

It is -- and you can't have people

8

investigating themselves.

9

Not GAPA, which a lot of programs

Rahm Emanuel,

The police are corrupt.

The

10

Justice Department report that came out, that's

11

why Lisa Madigan put in a consent decree, said

12

that Chicago Police, you, have never

13

investigated -- you never tried to end

14

corruption in Chicago.

15

Jon Burge died today.

He never

16

got convicted.

17

The Innocence Project knows three percent of

18

the people at least are innocent.

nodes to the balls, trained by Burge, right?

20

By the Chicago Police.

21

They're still torturing people.

I don't know if you're aware of

days since the Twin Towers were dropped by the

enslavement and apparatus instruments

6

controlled by the Rothschilds, et al.

7

It is now 17 years and nine

The first thing I have to

8

disclaim, there -- I'm working this with all my

9

heart, Lord, to bring it in to all of these

10

non-governmental entities that constitute the

11

enslavement and extermination apparatus, this

12

juncture controlled by the Rothschilds and a

13

committee of 300.

14

much more destructive than accommodating of

15

reliance from legitimacy indisputable that

16

is -- my understanding that is what I am

17

obliged to do.

18

In the balance, it is so

I would ask that since four

19

people didn't show up and since the

demanding a (inaudible) instructions.

when he was murdered on June of 2010, there has

been all kinds of activity for which there is

no rational explanation in terms of changing

the dates of the meeting, moving around the

5

country, changing the rules so the

6

Superintendent doesn't have to be here.

7

screamed bloody murder because I am claiming

8

that.

9

demonstrates that the contra-investigation of

10

the Bland, Young and Spencer murders has been

11

the highest priority of the City of Chicago

here.

all just sit here and turn a blind eye to the

7

Due to the community alert
