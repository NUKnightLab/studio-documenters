* Referred to the Finance Committee on 11/19/08.
Vice Chairman Sims, seconded by Commissioner Beavers, moved the approval of
Communication No. 297362.
Commissioner Silvestri asked for the total amount of appropriation authority that was approved
by the Board for capital projects.
John Morales, County Comptroller, stated that the original amount requested for capital projects
was $282,852,749 and it has now been reduced to $262,993,365, for a net reduction of
$19,859,384 (-7.02%) for that category.
The original amount requested for capital equipment was $152,186,857, and it has now been
reduced to $90,349,206, for a net reduction of $61,837,651 (-40.63%) for that category.
Commissioner Silvestri asked for the actual amount of Bond that will be issued.
Mr. Morales stated that the actual net was reduced from the original request of $375,900,000
down to $294,202,965 for a net reduction of $81,697,035 (-21.73%) below the original request.
Commissioner Collins expressed concern regarding a number of deferred capital improvement
program items. The items in question involved requests for new camera and security systems
at various county facilities. Questions had been raised regarding the possibility of paying for the
equipment with homeland security grants, and the requests were deferred pending more
information.
Bruce Washington, Director of the Office of Capital Planning and Policy, agreed that the
cameras and security systems were important priorities, and he was hopeful that approval to
proceed would be granted soon.
Chairman Daley stated that his understanding was that the matters could be deferred, and that
Mr. Washington had not indicated otherwise until now. Given the conflicting statements,
deferral of Communication Number 297362 in its entirety would be in order.
Commissioner Suffredin stated that the Board previously passed a bond authorization in the
amount of $740,000,000. The only thing that is before the Committee today is approval of the
finance team. He stated that once a team has been chosen, the Administration has the ability to
issue $740,000,000 worth of bonds. Commissioner Suffredin stated that he does not believe
that you can use the selection of the team to limit the amount of bonds the County is issuing.
The only thing that the Board is requested to do at this time is to approve the team. The dollar
amount is specified in the prior Ordinance that the Board previously approved, and is not before
the Committee at this time; therefore it can not be amended.
President Stroger stated that Commissioner Suffredin is not correct in his statement and would
like to check on the matter to verify his claim.
