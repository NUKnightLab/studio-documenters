33 schools (see attached chart) had 83 students who did not have access to evacuation chairs
Each school is responsible for safely evacuating all students within their building. but the
identi?ed students did not have access to evacuation chairs. and thus are unable to be salely
evacuated in the event 0! an emergency. Students with limited mobility may require the use of an
evacuation chair in order to exit the building. including the following. an mdivrdual who is non-
ambulatory and uses a wheelchair. an individual who is unable to ambulate independently. an
individual who is unable to ambulete independently on the stairs or uneven surfaces. an 
who requires guided physical assistance. or a student who requires assistance due to mental or
sensory deficits. Two types of evaCuation chairs were purchased in order to meet the individual
needs of the students. Evacuation chair covers. wall brackets. and wall hooks and covers also
were purchased to ensure this important lite-safety equipment is protected and mounted near a
stairway in order to have the evacuation chairs available in emergency situations. The purchases
were necessary to protect the health, safety. security. and well-being of the identi?ed students.
and thus were required on an emergency basis. Emergency purchases were initiated by the
Office of Special Education and Supports with approval of Procurement
