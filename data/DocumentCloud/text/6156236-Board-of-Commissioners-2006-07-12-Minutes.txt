PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT

AN AMENDMENT TO THE COOK COUNTY ZONING ORDINANCE OF 2001 TO ADD A
NEW SECTION PROHIBITING CERTAIN NEGATIVE USE RESTRICTIONS
WHEREAS, the County of Cook is a home rule unit of government pursuant to the 1970 111 inois
Constitution, Article VII, Section 6(a); and
WHEREAS, in accordance wi th Article VII, Section 6, and subject to the lim itations set forth therein, the
County of Cook may exercise any power and perform any function relating to its government and affairs;
and

12

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 12, 2006

WHEREAS, the County of Cook has passed a comprehensive zoning ordinance, known as the Cook
County Zoning Ordinance of 200 1 ("Ordinance") that is intended to promote the purposes set fo rth in
Article 2 of the Ordinance, including, without limitation, the public hea lth, safety , morals, comfort,
convenience and general welfare of the res idents of unincorporated Cook County; and
WHEREAS, the County Board finds that these purposes are furthered when property is used consistently
with the permitted and special uses identified in the Ordinance; and
WHEREAS, the County Board finds that the public health, safety and general welfare of the residents of
unincorporated Cook County are furthered when residents have access to grocery stores and drug stores,
both of which meet basic human needs; and
WHEREAS, Section 8. 1.2 of the Ordinance provides that the most restrictive regulation sha ll govern
when a requirement imposed by this Ordinance conflicts with any covenant or private agreement; and
WHEREAS, while the Ordinance recognizes the right of private parties to impose restrictions greater
than those set forth in the Ordinance, which will be recogni zed if they are valid and enforceable under
Illinois law, private parties are not free to enter into and impose restri ctions against private property if
such restrictions are against public policy ; and
WHEREAS, the County Board finds that Negative Use Restrictions, which enable a prior owner or
operator of a grocery store or drug store, after term inating operations at a site, to prevent any competitor
from operating a grocery store or drug store at such site in the future, limit uses that would otherwise be
permitted under the Ordinance; and
WHEREAS, the County Board finds that such Negative Use Restrictions are separate and distinct from
commercia lly reasonable non-compete clauses included in shopping center development agreements,
whereby a landlord may agree w ith a tenant that is a grocery store or drug store not to lease other space in
the same shopping center to a second grocery store or drug store in order to induce the tenant to sign a
long-term lease as an anchor tenant; and
WHEREAS, the County Board finds that such Negative Use Restrictions frustrate the purposes of the
Ordinance, serve no public purpose, compromi se the public health, safety, and general welfare, and
deprive the residents of unincorporated Cook County of the benefits of competition in the marketplace,
and cause significant deleterious and blighting effects on the affected comm un ity; and
WHEREAS, the County Board find s that the public health, safety, and general welfare of residents of
unincorporated Cook County are furthered when residents have access to grocery stores and drug stores,
both of w hi ch meet basic human needs; and
WHEREAS, the County Board finds, in contrast, however, that Negative Use Restrictions, which enable
a prior owner or operator of a grocery store or drug store, after terminating operations at a site, to prevent
any competi tor from operating a grocery store at such site in the future serve no public purpose but
instead have significant deleterious and blighting effects on the affected comm unity's health, safety and
general welfare; and
WHEREAS, the County Board finds that because grocery stores and drug stores frequently occupy large
tracts of land in the center of residentia l neighborhoods or at key inte rsections, the continued presence of
grocery stores or drug stores in unincorporated Cook County serves as a catalyst to other economic
development and advances the health, safety and general welfare of the residents of that community,
particularly those who are elderly or economically disadvantaged.

13

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDING S FOR JULY 12, 2006

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that Article 8
of the Cook County Zoning Ordinance of 2001 is amended by adding a new Section 8.1 .3 and changing
the numbering of the succeeding provisions as follows:
8.1.3

CERTAIN NEGATIVE USE RESTRICTIONS PROHIBITED AS AGAINST
PUBLIC POLICY

Notwithstanding Section 8. 1.2, a private agreement that purports to impose recorded negati ve use
restrictions upon real property in unincorporated Cook County so as to prohibit or have the
economic or practical effect of prohibiting the use of such real property for grocery store or drug
store purposes after a grocery store or drug store owner or operator of a store in excess of 7,500
square feet has terminated operations at the site, when such uses would otherwise be permitted,
including as a special use under this Ordinance, and which negative use restriction has a term of
more than one year, shall be against public policy, shall be void and unenforceable, and shall be
subject to remedial and enfo rcement powers under Sections 13. I 0 and 13. 11 of this Ordinance.
The foregoi ng prohibition shall not apply to an owner or operator of a grocery store or drug store
who terminates operations at a site for purposes of relocating such operations into a comparable
or larger store located within one-half mi le of the site where operations have term inated, provided
such relocation and the commencement of operations at the new site occurs within two years and
the negative use restriction imposed does not have a term in excess of three years. The Zoning
Administrator shall have discretion to extend the one-half mile lim it set forth in the preceding
sentence by one-half mi le ( i.e. to one mile) and to extend the two year commencement of
operations period by one year (i.e. to three years) upon the owner or operator's written request
and presentation of evidence establishing extenuating circumstances that establ ish good cause for
such extension(s). The requesting party shall also provide notice and a copy of such written
evidence to the district Commissioner(s) for the district in which the closed store and the new
store are located at the same time such submission is made to the Zoning Adm inistrator. The
foregoing prohibition shall apply regardless of whether the private agreement is incorporated in a
deed restriction, a restrictive covenant, T a lease or memorandum of lease, or any other recorded
instrument.
8.1.~ ~

ORDINANCE CONTENTS NOT A PERMIT

The contents of this Ordinance shall not be deemed a permit to use any property or to locate,
construct or maintain any building, structure or facility or to carry on any trade, industry,
occupation or activity.

8.1.4 ~ CUMULATIVE REGULATIO NS
The provisions of thi s Ordinance are cumulati ve with other laws and ordinances applying to the
same subject matters.

The index appended to this Ordinance is solely a reference guide, and shall not be construed as

PRO POSED O RDI NANCE

WHEREAS, a nationwide and regional shortage of trained medica l professionals has threatened the
timely deli very of health services to patients in the Cook County Bureau of Health Services ("B ureau"),
an institution which the poor, the uninsured, and the underinsured solely re ly upon for their health care
needs; and
WHEREAS, this shortage of medical professionals including nurses, pharmacists, and radiology
technicians, combined with com petitive salary rates for these positions in the private sector, has created a
rapidly shrinking pool of specific healthcare personnel in the Bureau; and
WHEREAS, the Bureau's current policy of hiring outside agencies to compensate for the lack of fulltime professional staff, especially in the case of nurses, is a temporary solution that is costly and
unpredictable; and
WHEREAS, despite the fact that more than 40% of our patients are Latino, less than 3% of physicians,
5% of nurses, and 0% of phannacists are Latino. However, the Bureau has been unsuccessful in
recrui ti ng an adequate number of bilingual profess ionals who have the language skills and cultural
knowledge to address the health needs of our growing Latino patient base; and
WHEREAS, there are many students of Lati n American origin, some of whom are undocumented, who
live in Cook County and work towards profess ional degrees in schools throughout Illinois, as well as
Latin Amer ican healthcare professionals who live in Cook County and are seeking licensure to practice
their profession in Ill inois; and
W HEREAS, after receiving an excellent education in our schools, many of these Latin Ameri can
students are unable to find employment because of their immigration status and are forced to return to
their country of origin; and
WHEREAS, in Cook County a lone, there are hundreds of highly skilled Latin American students
studying in various healthcare fields who are ready, willing, and able to contribute their skills and talents
during this healthcare staffing crisis; and
WHEREAS, Cook County has establ is hed itself as an immigrant friendly county and, as such, should
take the lead in demonstrating the benefits of hiring highly skilled, foreign-born healthcare professiona ls
to a lleviate our staffing shortages and strengthen our public health system; and
WHEREAS, it is the responsibil ity of our public health system to provide adequate staffi ng to perform
vita l funct ions in the de li very of government services during a protracted nationwide and regional
shortage of essential licensed medical professionals.

The IRIS system was developed by Proximare Health and they have sole knowledge of
code structure and database schema; and
There is no other vendor available to provide these services without a long lead time to
train and expensive learning curve; and
It is essential that service not be interrupted as it is an important part of current
infrastructure at the Bureau of Health Services; and
Proximare Health's service rate is within reasonable guidelines and w ill be cheaper than
establishing and training a new vendor.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $177,375.00. Contract period: July IS, 2006 through July 14, 2007. (893-260

Transmitting a Communication from

JOHN FALLON. Special Assistant to the Assessor
requesting authori zation for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with ACS Government Records
Management (ACS), Chicago, Illinois, to expand the capacity of the imaging system and the
maintenance/technical support that is required for the system.
Reason:

ACS Government Records Management (ACS) is the original vendor since the system's
inception. ACS has intimate know ledge of the Assessor's Office business processes and the
imaging system as it stands today. To have another vendor undertake this expansion and
enter the environment to learn the system and business processes would be very costly and
timely. ACS fully understands the Assessor's Office imaging system and the related business
functions that will be implemented making this the best way to expedite in a cost efficient
manner.

reasons, the Election Department believes it is necessary to seek a renewal of the current

Commissioner Gosl in stated that his concern is individual's operating a fl ea market sale out of their
garage sales.
Chairman Si lvestri asked the Building and Zoning Department if they have a mechanism to issue permits
for garage sa les and appropriate fee for garage sales permits.
Mr. Wlodarski replied the applicants would have to come downtown to obtain a permit. The Building
and Zoning Department does not have full-time staff at the court houses.
Chairman Silvestri suggested that the Building and Zoning Department do more extensive research on the
issues of permits fo r garage sales, working with townships and the Sheriffs Office.
Mr. Wlodarski stated most municipalities issue permits for garage sales. The Building and Zoning
Department would find it difficult enforcing the ordinance in judging household items as a garage sale.
There are no overtime funds available for weekend inspections of garage sale items.

Commissioner Goslin, seconded by Commissioner Butler, moved to approve Communication No.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 12, 2006

Commissioner Quigley inquired whether Ms. Dunnings is confident that the shortfalls that were discussed
in the prior meeting will be overcome this year.
Ms. Dunnings referenced a series of contracts approved at the June 20, 2006 Board meeting submitted by
the Bureau of Health Services. She further stated the Bureau of Health Services has broadened its
revenue enhancement initiative; they are aggressively pursuing the recovery of Supplemental Security
Income/Social Security Di sability Income funds. Additional ly, in April 2006 the Board approved a
resolution, which provides for the issuance of a monthly revenue report. In compliance with this
resolution, the commissioners are receiving a monthly update of these activities.

Commiss ioner Quigley inquired as to what the Bureau's shortfall was last year.
Walter K. Knorr, County Comptroller, replied the shortfall was $60 million in patient fees. There was an
additional IGT (Intergovernmental Transfer) payment, and the net shortfall was $40 million. He
concluded by stating the Bureau of Health Services spent I 00% of their budget last year.
Chairman Daley stated that he had subm itted a letter to a ll of the elected officials and department heads,
wherein he requested that the commissioners take up at the next Board Meeting the issue of holding
everyone to 96% of their appropriated funds. He requested that these parties reply to the letter today or
before the next board meeting.
Vice Chairman Steele voiced concern that Cook County vendors not be sacrificed in this reserving
process.
Chairman Daley repl ied that th is would not occur, and that contractual obligations would not be affected.
Commissioner Hansen inquired whether any of the funds could be used in the 2007 Budget.
Thomas J. G laser, Chief Financial Officer, Bureau of Finance, replied in the negative. Mr. Glaser further
stated that the accrued s urplus in the 110 Account (Salaries & Wages of Regu lar Employees) is as of the
first pay period in June.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's inquiry, Ms. Dunnings stated that the amount of transfers under
$25,000 totals $225,538; the amount of transfers over $25,000, totals $23,871 ,278. She further stated that
these figures would be provided to the Board for the 2007 Transfer of Funds meeting.
Ms. Dunnings replied that various departments have ass ured her that these funds wi ll cover budgetary
needs until commencement of fiscal year 2007.
In response to Commissioner Goslin's question regarding the budget process, Ms. Dunnings responded
the budget is not a zero-based budget; each new budget is developed using the previous year's budget as a
guide.
Chairman Daley clarified the fiscal year began December I, 2005, and that this transfer of funds meeting
is based on the previous seven months of the c urrent fiscal year.
Commissioner Peraica made various mid-year transfer observations. He continued by stating since 2002,
the overall budget has grown; however the percentage of transfers has declined. The dec li ne in the
amount of transfers is a result of the commissioners restraining departments.

Commissioner C laypool asked Dr. Winship to expla in the purpose of the large transfer amounts into
overtime.
Dr. Daniel H. Winship, Chief, Bureau of Health Services, replied that the majority of the funds are being
allocated to nursing, phannacy, and laboratory and technology technician positions. These positions are
difficult to fill because of the market competition and the wages being offered by the Bureau of Health
Services. Dr. Winship further stated collective bargaining agreements also impact the need for this
transfer.
Commissioner Quigley inquired what overtime reduction measures are being pursued.
Dr. Winship replied that the Bureau of Health Services has an overtime reduction plan, wh ich is reviewed
at least monthly by the Chief Operating Officers and the Chief Medical Officers.
Chairman Daley announced that Jonathan Rothstein will be meeting with the commissioners individually
to discuss the status of the collective bargaining agreement currently being negotiated.

transfers of funds.

Mr. Clark replied that Cermak Health Services of Cook County currently has approximately 45 vacancies,
namely nurses, radiology technicians, etc.

158

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 12, 2006

Ms. Dunnings provided the following c larification that the funds being transferred out of the I I 0 account
are earned surplus (budgeted pay from the vacancies not otherwise being utilized) through the first pay
period in June.
Mr. Clark specified that the recent Joint Comm ission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations
(JCAHO) accreditation required overtime work; and that Cermak Health Services of Cook County
currently has fifty-five vacant positions, including part-time vacancies.
Commissioner Peraica inquired as to the demand for health services at Cermak.
Mr. Clark replied that the sickness acuity level has risen; on average three hundred patients go through
intake daily. Those who are treatable remain; the others are transferred to Stroger Hospital of Cook
County or Provident Hospital of Cook County. Ten to sixteen dialysis patients are at Cermak at any
given time.
Mr. Clark replied that the overtime was spent in the Medical Records department, where staffing is
limited. Also, Cermak is not reimbursed when it provides photocopying for medical records requested by
the courts and the State ' s Attorney's Office.
Ms. Dunnings presented the following clarification regarding the term, "administrator", as shown on page
1-9 of the Budget Book. The budget is divided into business units. One of these business units is entitled,
"Admini stration." This unit includes administrative positions, as well as support positions for those
administrative positions.
In response to Commissioner Sims' concern regarding the use of overtime by the Bureau of Health
Services, Dr. Wi nship noted that the Bureau has substantially lowered its use, from $55 million in 2004,
to $46 million in 2005 and, for the first seven months in this year, only $20 million.
In response to Commissioner Peraica's inquiry, Sidney A. Thomas, Acting Chief Operating Officer,
Ambulatory and Community Health Network of Cook County (ACHN), stated that pharmacy and
radiology were transferred to Stroger Hospital of Cook County in the 2005 Budget. ACHN no longer
manages the outpatient pharmacy or radiology services .
Commissioner Quigley inquired as to the DuSable and Austin High School clinics.
Mr. Thomas replied that these clinics wi ll now be serving a larger population of four schools each.
Commissioner Peraica inquired whether the percentage allocations for the fi ve suburban c linics will
remain the same into the 2007 fi scal year, and whether these clinics wi ll continue to provide the same
level of service.
Mr. Thomas replied in the affirmative.
Commissioner Peraica inquired whether any cuts are planned.
Mr. Thomas replied in the negative.
Commissioner Peraica inquired what the purpose is for the transfer of $920,563 in funds from Budgetary
Unit 898.

159

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 12, 2006

Dr. Winship replied that this is the same type of transfer as the one Mr. C lark described.
Commissioner Peraica inquired how many vacancies the Bureau of Health Services currently has.
Dr. Winship replied that the Bureau of Health Services currently has approximately 600 vacancies.
Commissioner Peraica inquired why the transfer rate into Account 260 has risen from $400,000 in 2005
to $2,320,000 in 2006.
Dr. Winship replied that this is due to the growth of the mail order pharmacy. The total transfer fo r the
year will be $7,300,000 and this will provide enough funding until fiscal year 2007.
Com missioner Peraica inquired as to the need for the transfer from Provident Hospital of Cook County.
John A. Fairman, Sr., Chief Operating Officer, Provident Hospital of Cook County, replied that there are
eighty-five to ninety vacancies in rad iology, nursing, and pharmacy. He further stated the transfer is
needed to also facilitate capital projects as well as the numerous repai rs that were dictated by the Joint
Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) and the Illinois Department of
Public Health.
In response to Commissioner Peraica's inquiry regarding the pharmacy, Mr. Fairman replied the
pharmacy project is ahead of schedule, and will likely open early next year.
Chairman Daley noted that, on page 345, the number of vacancies is listed as twenty-eight.
Ms. Dunni ngs noted that page 345 lists only the vacancies that have been open longer than one year.
Vice Chairman Steele inquired as to where funds come from when vacant positions are fill ed.
Ms. Dunnings replied that funds are transferred from other vacant positions w ithin the same institution .
Commissioner Peraica asked Johnny C. Brown, Chief Operating Officer, Stroger Hospital of Cook
County, why the hospital has a $500,000 deficit at mid-year.
Mr. Brown reiterated the problem that the issue of staffing presents, s pecifically in nursing, pharmacy,
laboratory, and radiology.
Commissioner Peraica voiced concern that $7,000,000 will not be enough fund s for Stroger Hospital of
Cook County, given its need for funds so far this year.
Mr. Brown replied that efficiencies are being implemented in non-patient areas.
Comm issioner Peraica inquired why additional funding is needed for the current parking management
service.
Mr. Brown replied that an increase is anticipated in association with the contract renegotiation.

not clear as to what the contract increase would be.

In response to Commi ssioner Peraica's questions as to the duration of the contract, Mr. Holley replied that

non-competiti ve rates.
Chairman Daley urged the commissioners to meet with Dr. Winship if they have any further
recommendations.
Wi th regard to Budgetary Unit 897, Account 449, "Operation, Maintenance and Repair of Institutional

Commissioner Peraica requested that Jerry Robinson, Superintendent, Juvenile Temporary Detention
Center (JTDC), provide some details regarding the JTDC's transfer of funds request.
Mr. Robinson stated that the transfer of funds will be utilized mostly for overtime, which is necessary
given the thirty-five open positions. Most of these positions are for detention counselors. Other open
positions include caseworkers, medical department staff, nurses, psychologists and a physician. Recently,
approximately ten employees were hired. There are approximately 516 positions allocated in the budget,
and the vacancy rate is approximately I 0%.
Ms. Dunnings provided the following calculation: the cost for salary and benefits for 516 JTDC
employees, at an average salary of $40,000, and including $8,000 in benefits, would total approximately
$29,000,000.
Mr. Robinson further stated that the amount of money that will be required to comply with the
Supplemental Implementation Plan has not yet been determined. He believes that the amount of money
required to implement the Memorandum of Agreement has been included in the original budget. The
JTDC is applying for grants from the Annie E. Casey Foundation and the like, in order to be able to
upgrade their computer system, and for other projects.

by Earlean Collins, County Commissioner.
PROPOSED RESOLUTION

MINORITY AND WOMEN-OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE
COMPLIANCE RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, Cook County is a home rule unit of local government pursuant to Article VII
Section 6(a) of the 1970 Illinois Constitution, and as such may exercise any power and
perform any function pertaining to its government and affairs; and

266

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 12, 2006

WHEREAS, it is the policy of the County of Cook to create equal oppo rtunities in the award
of or participation in County contracts and to eliminate arbitrary barriers to full and equitable
opportunities for participation, as both prime and sub-contractors, in s uch contracts by
businesses certified as MBEs and WBEs; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners has adopted a Minority and WomenOwned Business Enterprise Ordinance (" MBE/WBE Ordinance") which establishes a goal of
award ing not Jess than thirty-five percent (35%) of the annual total dollar amount of County
contracts to certified MBEs and WBEs; and
WHEREAS, set backs from a 2000 Federal court case, 123 F. Supp. 2d 1087 (N. D. Ill.
2000), which invalidated some set aside programs for MBEs and WBEs, has resulted in a
conti nuous decrease in the number of MBE and WBE participation in County contracts; and
WHEREAS, while there has been some efforts made in bringing the County ' s Ordinance in
compliance with Federal Jaw and moving toward reaching the County's goal of creating equal
opportunity in the award of or participation in County contracts the urgency of the situation
and the difficulty of minority businesses to stay open due to the heavy reliance on County
contracts calls for the need of a public hearing to address the concerns of the County, MB Es
and WBEs.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that a publ ic hearing be conducted by the
Business and Economic Committee to determine the County's compliance with the
MBE/WBE Ordinance and federal law on MBE and WBE contract participation, to get
proper feed back from MBE and WBE participants, and to ascertain what can be done to
create greater opportunities for MBE and WBE participation in County contracts including
professional service contracts.
*Referred to the Business and Economic Development Committee on 06/20/06.
Chairman Collins called on Patrick T . Driscoll, Jr., Deputy State's Attorney, Chief, Civi l Actions Bureau,
State' s Attorney' s Office, to address the Committee.
Patrick Driscoll stated that in 1996 a lawsuit was filed against Cook County challenging the
Minority/Women Business Preference Ordinance, it was fi led by contractors and challenged only the
constitutionality of the Ordinance as it relates to construction projects. A trial was held in 2000 before
Judge Gready in the United States District Court. The court entered an order invalidating the Ordinance,
finding that it was unconstitutional as it applied to construction contracts . It has not been enforced since
the year 2000; at this time it only applies to non-construction contracts. The decision was appealed to the
United States Court of Appeals, and in July of 200 I the Federal Court of Appeals in Chicago affi rmed
Judge Gready' s decision, finding that his ana lysis was correct that there wasn' t suffic ient evidence shown
during the trial to justify the percentages that were set aside fo r women and minority business owners.
Further, there was a companion case brought agai nst the C ity of Chicago by the same plaintiffs that was
tried before Judge Moran several years ago; Judge Moran fo und that the City of Chicago's Ordinance as it
relates to construction projects had the same evidentiary deficiencies as the Cook County Ordinance.
Chairman Collins called on Betty Hancock Perry, Office of Contract Compliance, to address the
Comm ittee.

267

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 12, 2006

Ms. Hancock Perry stated that in the past year the Office of Contract Compliance reviewed and revised
the certification process. The Office of Contract Compliance has revised the procedure for contract
review and monitoring. Further, her staff is responsible for certification, contract reviewing, and contract
monitoring and processing for all of Cook County. In the past year the Office of Contract Compliance
looked at how it could improve the process; one of the things was to take the certification process and
review it line-by-line and make sure that the information that was being requested from vendors is in fact
information that will help the Office of Contract Compliance make a determination as to whether or not
the company is owned and controlled by a woman or a minority individual. In the area of construction,
the Ordinance was struck down with regards to women and minority business enterprises being involved
in construction or being included. Over the past year the Office of Contract Compliance has looked at the
process and determined that while the participation may not be as high as it was in previous years there
still is substantial participation for women and minorities in construction. Ms. Hancock Perry stated that
the Office of Contract Compliance is implementing a new training program for purchasing individuals
who are within Cook County and using departments. A training session has been set up for individuals to
come in on a bi-weekly basis to work together with the Office of Contract Compliance. The Office of
Contract Compliance can only do what is intended in the Ordinance.
Chairman Collins called Janet K. Williams, Contract Administrator, Office of the Purchasing Agent, to
address the Committee.
Ms. Williams stated that the Office of the Purchasing Agent is the agency that procures goods and
services at the best market price for all of Cook County agencies. There are approximately 55 employees
in the Office of the Purchasing Agent and the website provides a listing of all the current bid proposals.
There are four types of contracts that the Office of the Purchasing Agent deal s with: I) the open market
or request for quotes are contracts that are under $25,000, are informal bids which are awarded to the
lowest bidder meeting specifications, are not awarded by the County Board, and the quotes are solicited
and received by mail, fax or telephone; 2) sole source contracts are contracts of any amount, but those
contracts are for commodities that must be available only through one manufacturer or they are
specialized items, Board authorization that is required, and it takes about four to six weeks to be
processed; 3) formal bids are requests for bids, are for items over $25,000, awarded to the lowest
responsive bidder meeting specifications, are a sealed bid process in which vendors are solicited through a
vendors list, Board authorization is required, and those contracts take approximately six to eight weeks to
be processed; and 4) Request for Proposals ( RFP) are handled directly by the individual using
departments. Ms. Williams listed some recommendations for the contractors: make sure that the entire
contract is completed; if the contract requires site inspection then be sure to attend; the contract must
comply with the MBE/WBE participation (the only contracts that do not require that are open market
contract under $25,000; read the special conditions and the specification pages before putting in the
amounts; comply w ith the specifications as they are written; complete the execution forms; and if the
contractor is a local Cook County business make sure the space is checked.
Chairman Collins asked Randolph M. Johnston, Assistant State' s Attorney, Deputy Supervisor,
Transactions and Health Law Unit, State' s Attorney's Office, to address the Committee regarding the
RFP process.
Mr. Johnston stated that the RFP process is an alternative process. The RFP process is meant if you're in
essence going to purchase the company's reputation, the company's prior performance because there is a
unique need for the particular type of service. Cook County has an RFP process which lets prospective
proposers know that a County agency is interested and a packet exists with information describing the
services being sought and instructions to the proposer on how the proposal is to be put together and
submitted to the County. The us ing department will often develop a committee to evaluate the proposals
that are received. Once the process is completed and the using department has identified one or more

268

 JO URNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 12, 2006

vendors, the vendors are notified and then the County enters into a process of negotiating a contract with
those prospective vendors and then the contract would have to go through the nonnal contracting process.

277

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 12, 2006

Mr. Robinson replied that hard-covered textbooks, pencils and pens are not allowed upstairs, because they
can be used as weapons. Efforts are made to ensure that the children get to the library to access whatever
books they need. Pencils are supplied for the writing of homework, grievances, letters, etc., and are taken
back when the need for them is over.
Commissioner Suffredin asked for confinnation that no one keeps the children from books or from the
opportunity to do their homework.
Mr. Robinson confirmed this.

obtaining soft-bound books.

Commissioner Suffredin requested that James L. Eldridge, Jr., Chief Administrative Officer, Bureau of
Administration, and ASA Helen Haynes, Supervisor, Transactions and Health Law Unit, State ' s
Attorney ' s Office, make some remarks regarding the process that has lead up to this Ordinance.
Mr. Eldridge stated that this project was made a priority by President Stroger. Thi s compiled and codified
code will not only be invaluable to the legal profession, but also to all the citizens of Cook County. As
directed through an amendment in the 1996 budget, industrial engineers prepared a leg islative reference
bureau study in which the primary recommendation was to codify the County's ordinances prior to
establishing a legislative reference bureau. Codifying the County Code was the task which this gro up was
directed to accom plish. I have to emphasize the amount of effort that went into codifying the County' s
code. This group has been working together for over two years on this project and has put in hundreds of
hours. This project would not have moved fo rward without the tremendous effort and resources of the
State's Attorney' s Office. They were instrumental in reviewing every single word in the Code. Also
playing major roles in this project were the following people: Jack Weinrauch, Assistant to the President;
Jerry Pray, Industrial Eng ineer; Elizabeth Reidy, Deputy Bureau Chief, Civil Actions Bureau, State's
Attorney' s Office; Sara Hynes, Assistant State ' s Attorney, State' s Attorney's; Office; Joy Wykowski,
Deputy C lerk, Clerk of the Board; Benny Martin, Executive Law Librarian; Hollis Hanover, General
Counsel, Office of Commissioner Larry Suffredin; Michelle Devine, former Director of
Intergovernmental Relations, Office of Commi ssioner Larry Suffredin. Additionally, I would like to give
special recognition to Catherine Maras O' Leary, Chief Information Officer, Bureau of Information
Technology and Automation; Karen Griffin, Assistant to the Chief Information Officer; La ura Lechowicz
Felicione, Special Assistant to the Pres ident; Michelle Harris, Secretary to the Board; Tom O' Brien,
Assistant to Commissioner Hansen; Debbie Santana, Assistant to Commissioner Carl Hansen; and Roger
Meiriam, Municipal Code Corporation, who was responsible for preparing the County Code document.
Assistant State's Attorney Haynes stated that she wo uld reserve her remarks for the discussion of the
amendments.

Commissioner Suffredin, seconded by Commissioner Daley, moved the approval of Amendment #1
to the Ordinance.

Commissioner Suffredin made the following remarks: These additions, modifications and corrections
represent corrections that the County Clerk's Office, the State' s Attorney's Office, and our Contractor
have found necessary in order to bring this Code into a correct state as we go to passage. Also contained
in the language are the savings clauses for those ordinances which we are not putting in the code. The
Building Code is one example. We are going to have to do something about the Building Code. Mr.
C hairman, you and I have discussed thi s and it is going to your Committee. We do a lot of references to
other laws and industry codes I our current Building Code. So rather than try to dislodge that, we are
maintaining it as it is. There also is a list of resolutions and ordinances which we are not changing; these
resolutions will stay in effect but will not be in the Code. We will examine and perhaps alter these
resolutions as we move forward.
The Vice Chairman asked whether the re-codification will direct people to the Building Code.
C hairman Suffredin replied in the affirmative.
Vice Chairman Silvestri noted that Amendment # I addresses pages 46, S06, 509, 637, 677, 693, 70S, 730,
73 1, 736, 776, 777, 806, 896 and pages I 094 through I 096.

Chairman Suffredin, seconded by Commissioner Daley, moved the approval of the Amendment #1
to the Ordinance. The motion carried.

286

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 12, 2006

AMENDMENT #2
MOTION TO AMEND AND TO RECOMMEND FOR APPROVAL, AS AMENDED,
THE COOK COUNTY CODE ADOPTION ORDINANCE OF 2006
It is hereby moved that the proposed Cook County Code Adoption Ordinance of 2006,
being considered by the Legislative and Intergovernmental Affairs Committee of the
Cook County Board of Comm issioners on June 27, 2006, be amended as set forth on the
s ubmitted proposed Ordinance and that such proposed Ordinance, as amended, be
recommended for approval by the Cook County Board of Commissioners.

Chairman Suffredin offered the following clarification: In Section 3, page 3 of the Ordinance, for the
purposes of this code adoption Ordinance of 2006, any legislation adopted by the Board prior to October
I, 2006, that contains provisions that are of a general and permanent nature, shall be considered an
Ordinance. Instructions exist in the code directing Commissioners only to present Ordinances, not
resolutions.
Commissioner Peraica, seconded by Chairman Suffredin, moved the approval of the Amendment
#2 to the Ordinance.
Commissioner Coll ins inquired whether the "whereas" clauses/purpose/declaration of intent are going to
be eliminated as a result of this Ordinance.
Commissioner Suffredin replied that this code includes only an "action" section not, " whereas c lauses."
Another ordinance, drafted by Jack Weinrauch on a Legislative Reference Bureau, is pending. This
ordinance would create an Office of Legislative Counsel for the Board. Chapter One of the revised Code
contains instructions regarding how to draft an ordinance, as distinguished from a memorializing
resolution . I hope in the next budget session we will have legislative counsel to advise us regarding form
and substance. In the meantime, I have as ked the State's Attorney's Office to work with the
Commiss ioners upon the adoption of this Ordinance, to help them understand the format. As a result, we
should have consistency and it should be easier to amend this Code. This Code will be printed in the
volumes distributed to all Commissioners in February. It w ill also be available online and in cd format.
This presents a tremendous opportunity for the citizens to know the law. This format is the exact same
format used in the current State of lllinois statutes.
Vice Chairman Silvestri s uggested that the distinction between a resolution and an ordinance could be
made under the Rules of the Board.
Chairman Suffredin reiterated the sizable contribution that Jack Weinrauch made to this effort. He
requested that Assistant State' s Attorney Haynes provide a short overview of the how we got to this point.
Assistant State's Attorney Haynes stated that the first motion corrects severa l errors in the draft. The
second motion contains general language allowing the C lerk, in collaboration with the State's Attorney's
Office and Mr. Weinrauch ' s Office, to instruct Munic ipal Code Corporation to make certain technical
changes . When the document is published it will be reader-friendly. This may require some reordering.
The process started several years ago. We requested that a document with underlining and strikeout be
generated to show the changes that were made to the original ordinances. In several areas, the ordinances
are particularly out-of-date. Several ordinances from the Bureau of Health Services and Building Code
fall into that category. We' ve retained these provisions without including them in the Code, in case you
wish to update them through the supplement process; Municipal Code Corporation is under contract to
supplement this periodically.

287

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 12, 2006
Chairman Suffredin noted that the State of Illinois has a revisory statute that deals with the clean up of
ordinances.
Commissioner Peraica stated that an indexing component and a central staff that could work with the
Commissioners in terms of historical and legislative research would be excellent additions to this system.
Chairman Suffredin noted that he maintains a legislative library containing all the enactments since he has
been in office. He is eagerly looking to turn this over to someone who might perform this role or
someone in Board Secretary Michelle Harris' office. History of who introduced ordinances, how this was
amended, when they were passed, in order to give lawyers, judges, etc., the tools they need.
Vice Chairman Si lvestri noted that the effective date of the Ordinance is October 1, 2006.
Commissioner Peraica, seconded by Commissioner Suffredin, moved the approval of Amendment
#2 to the Ordinance. T he motion carried.
Chairman Suffredin, seconded by Commissioner Peraica, moved the approval of Communication
No. 275835, as amended. The motion carried.

County and for him for a number of years; he was an outstanding legi slative aide and administrative
assistant. He would help this Board tremendously.
C hairman Suffredin stated that there is no question that Mr. Lorenzi is the choice of President Stroger; the

Mr. Lorenzi replied that he would support Pres ident and CEO Don Pechous' s efforts. Mr. Pechous has
several efforts underway in terms of tax reactivation programs. These items were, a year ago, high on Mr.
Pechous' agenda, and included an effort to bring in federal tax dollars to encourage business to locate or
relocate within economically challenged economic areas. Also, the Enterpriz Cook County Board has an
ongoing effort to bring in new members.
Vice Chairman Silvestri congratulated Mr. Lorenzini ' s work in the public sector, stating that he is

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 12, 2006

Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Real Estate Subcommittee of the Board of Comm issioners of Cook County met pursuant to notice
on Wednesday, June 28, 2006 at the hour of 10:00 A.M. in the Board Room, Room 569, County Building,
118 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois.
Your Subcommittee has considered the following items and upon adoption of this report, the

Chairman Steele asked the Secretary to the Board to read the notice into the record.
279590

REAL ESTATE MANAGEMENT DIVISION, by John W. Davis, Director, transmitting a
Communication, dated May 3 I, 2006:
requesting authorization to enter into and execute a three-year extension agreement with 69
West Washington Management Company, LLC. ("69 WWMC"), for the continued
management and operation of the 69 West Washington Building (the " Building") pursuant to
the Management Agreement approved by th is Board on August 7, 1997 (the "Contract"),
previously extended by a first amendment to Management Agreement approved by this Board
on June 20, 2000, and by a second amendment to Management Agreement approved by this
Board on July I, 2003. The contract expires July 31 , 2006.
Submitted with this letter is a copy of the proposal for extension, including a summary of the
accomplishments of 69 West Washington Management Company during the current term.
The proposed extension will be on a ll the terms and conditions contained in the contract, as
previously amended, including the annual increase based on the Consumer Price Index.
C urrently, the management fee is $ 177,525 per year.
Oversight and supervision of 69 WWMC is by the Real Estate Management Division, with
dual responsibility by the Director of Facilities Management, John T. Joiner, as to physical
conditions, renovation and services to the building.
Mr. Joiner concurs in th is
recommendation.
Approval recommended.

*Referred To The Real Estate Subcommittee 04/05/06.
Comm issioner Peraica asked Mr. Davis who are the principals of the management company of the LLC.
John W. Davis, Director, Real Estate Management Division, replied that the principals are U.S. Equities
and East Lake Corporation; those principals of that corporation form the LLC.
Comm issioner Peraica voiced his concern on the original agreement that provides the exclusive rights for
69 WWMC to manage 69 West Washington.
Anna Ashcraft, Special Assistant to the President stated it is a management agreement in which the owner
would enter into with a managing company where they enter into contracts on the County ' s behalf for
janitorial and security services. The company assists in negotiating leases, and makes recommendations
on improvements and maintenance of the building. The company also submits a budget every year which
is reviewed and approved by the Real Estate Management Division. A typical management agreement is
a three year term and the Real Estate Management Division returns to the Board of Commissioners when
the term is abo ut to expire. The original agreement began on August I, 1997.

292

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 12, 2006
John Joiner, Director, Department of Facil ities Management, replied that 69 West Washington is
privatized and there are no county employees doing work on the structure.

REAL ESTATE MANAGEMENT DIVISION, by John W. Davis, Director, Michael F.
Sheahan, Sheriff of Cook County by Robert E. Beavers, Chief Deputy Sheriff, Court Services
Division, transmitting a Communication, dated May 31, 2006:
requesting approval of the First Amendment to Contract No. 01-54-528 Rebid with

JONETTE PRODUCTS ENTERPRISE, LTD., Chicago, Illinois, to provide food service
management at the Criminal Court Administration Building including operation of the
cafeteria for food service to the public and for preparation of meals for delivery to jurors and
judges.
Prior to expiration of the contract in 2004, the Office of Capital Planning and Policy had
proposed a renovation of the kitchen and cafeteria area, and the Board of Commissioners
approved an extension to the contract on July 13, 2004, expiring June 12, 2006, since rebidding the contract was not practical while renovation plans and construction were under
way.
Plans are now complete and the Office of Capital Planning and Policy is ready to begin
construction, which should be completed within nine to twelve months. The cafeteria and
kitchen areas will not be usable during construction, and food service to the general public
will not be available. However, the current contractor, Janette Products Enterprises, Ltd., is
willing and able to provide meals for judges and jurors service from $3.89 per judge' s meal
and $3.83 per jury meal , which represents the base amount established in the contract, with a
cost of living increase annually. In addition, the number of meals required has increased
from approximately 66,365 in 200 I to 105,000 today, due to the increased number of trials
occurring as the judiciary attempts to reduce the backlog of cases.
Under the terms of the First Amendment, the contract with the current vendor would be
extended for a period of one year, and increased to provide for the increased number of meal s
and the CPI increase. Rent paid under the contract by the vendor will be waived once
construction commences, since the space will be unavailable for use. The county has the
option to tenninate at any time with a thirty day notice, so that once construction is complete
and another contract has been awarded, this contract will be terminated.

Your Committee on Rules of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County met pursuant to notice on
Tuesday, June 27, 2006 at the hour of 12:00 P.M. in the Board Room, Room 569, County Building, I 18
North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois.
Your Committee has considered the following item and upon adoption of this report, the recommendation
is as follows:
272037

AN ORDINANCE ESTABLISHING THE BOUNDARIES OF EACH OF TH E 17
COUNTY COMMISSIONER DISTRICTS BY STREET LOCATION (PROPOSED
ORDINANCE). Sponsored by Larry Suffredin, County Commissioner. Transmitting a
Communication, dated June 28, 2005.
The County board is required by law to redistrict after each decenn ial census to insure that
the 17 County Commissioner Districts are of equal population according to the census data
from the U.S. Census Bureau. The last redistricting plan was approved in 200 I.
This ordinance replaces the boundaries of each district, as defined by technical tracts of land
in 200 I, with boundaries defined by street locations. This ordinance does not affect the
boundaries of any district. Instead, the changes will aid with the codification of Cook
County 's laws.
The following is a synopsis of the Proposed Ordinance.
PROPOSED ORDINANCE
The metes and bounds descriptions of this ordinance have been designed to describe exactly
the same areas that were described in the census tract and block description used when these
districts were created in 200 I. Absent an undetected error, there is no difference in the "new"
descriptions of the districts from those used in the 2002 elections and in the Primary Election
earlier this year.
The Clerk of Cook County is given authority to make any clerical or technical changes to
conform the 200 I ordinance to this ordinance.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 12, 2006

Commissioner Suffredin, seconded by Commissioner Silvestri, moved approval of Communication
No. 272037.
Commissioner Suffredin introduced an amendment to the Proposed Ordinance, and would like to make
the letter from David Orr, Cook County C lerk part of the record. (The referenced document is on file in
the Office of the County Clerk.)

Commissioner Suffredin moved to amend Comm. No. 272037 by inserting the following text after
the ordinance heading, "PROPOSED ORDINANCE": The metes and bounds descriptions of this
ordinance have been designed to describe exactly the same areas that were described in the census
tract and block description used when these districts were created in 2001. Absent an undetected
error, there is no difference in the "new" descriptions of the districts from those used in the 2002
elections and in the Primary Election earlier this year.
The Clerk of Cook County is given authority to make anv clerical or technical changes to conform
the 2001 ordinance to this ordinance. Seconded by Commissioner Silvestri, the motion carried.
Commissioner Peraica inquired as to what is the rationale for having the amendment in the title of the
Ordinance.
Commissioner Suffredin responded that it would give the Cook County Clerk the authority and it would
give individuals notice that this is an Ordinance to make the presentation in the County' s new codification
easier for the citizens to read.
Commissioner Suffredin closed by stating that the boundaries of the Commissioners Districts would be
c learer for citizens who may go the code e ither online or in the printed form.

Commissioner Suffredin, seconded by Commissioner Silvestri moved approval of Communication
Number 272037, as amended. The motion carried.

WHEREAS, the Chicago Harbor lock at 68 years old is I 8 years past its life expectancy, has eroded past
the point of repair, has required urgent large-scale repairs three times since 1992 to keep functioning, and
needs to be replaced; and
WHEREAS, the lock is a critical link in Ch icago's transportation system, opening and closing I I ,000
times a year to allow over 40,000 vessels to pass between Lake Michigan and the Chicago River, making
it the nation's second busiest lock; and
WHEREAS, recreational and commercial boating could be disrupted for weeks if the lock fails to open
or c lose properly, compromising the$ I 0 million annua l revenues from the tour boat industry; and
WHEREAS, the lock was built to help Illinois comply with the I930 U.S. Supreme Court decision that
strictly limits how much water the state can divert from Lake Michigan, and any sign ificant leakage at the
lock reduces the amount of lake water area communities can use to supply drinking water to growing
suburbs; and
WHEREAS, the lock is used as a mechan is m to prevent the river water from entering the lake in order to
manage pollutants, and is also a last resort safety valve that has been used five times since I 996 to keep
the Chicago River from overflowing its banks; and
WHEREAS, if the lock were to jam or experience outright failure at the wrong time it could prove
catastrophic for downtown Chicago, as in the case of the Loop Flood in I 992 whereby 250 million
gallons of water poured into downtown Chicago causing upward of$ I billion in damage; and
WHEREAS, the lock is owned by the Army Corps of Engineers, which stated in a I 999 study that
continuing to make repairs as needed is not a viable option; and
WHEREAS, new gates for the lock and machinery to operate them would cost nearly $20 million in
federal funding; and

352

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 12, 2006

WHEREAS, members oflllinois' Congressional delegation have been working towards obtaining federal
funding for this crucial project, however, broad support is needed at the local, state and federal level to

that in order to promote and protect the safety and welfare of the citizens of Cook County, it is necessary
and in the best interest of the public that the C hicago Harbor lock be replaced; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County calls upon the
members of the United States House of Representatives and Senate, and upon the President of the United
States to fund the replacement of the Chicago Harbor lock as soon as possible.
