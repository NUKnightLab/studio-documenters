PUBLIC COMMENTS (3 minutes each)
Michael Betzold

On October 24th Roger Penske was awarded the Presidential
medal of freedom. It was fitting because President Trump has
made millions of acres of public land more accessible to corporate
activity just like Penske turns Belle Isle into a private racetrack
every spring. Penske should have shared the island with people
here in this room however Ron Olson certainly deserves accolades
for ignoring request from the CR club, the Audubon Society, and
other far left organizations for an environmental impact study of
the Grand Prix. About special awards for testifying for the Detroit
City Council that the event brings some umpteen made up millions
in economic benefit to the city when he never read the study that
concocted those figures and didn’t know whether it were true and
they’re special contribution of this committee’s chair. Her
unflighting efforts to praise the partnership of Mr. Penske because
his annual fundraiser raises close to a million dollars that goes
directly into the budget of the organization that pays her lucrative
six figure salary. Surely Donald Trump should honor that kind of
enterprise. Especially since there is not any quid pro quo, just
business as usual. In fact, why not honor every member of this
committee since every one of them served even though all of their
appointments have long ago expired and no one on the committee
has stated any opposition to the Grand Prix or to the Detroit Auto
Show events on Belle Isle. Under this body of leadership is wide
open to more business and to more concrete. Couple final notes: I
was surprised to find that citizens of Detroit are not citizens of
Michigan therefore don’t pay taxes that go to support the general
fund or activities that are spent on Belle Isle and secondly that the
comment on Belle Isle was a four-season park. I would amend that
to say it’s a three-season park because in the Spring most of us
cannot come to Belle Isle without being assaulted. Thank you.
