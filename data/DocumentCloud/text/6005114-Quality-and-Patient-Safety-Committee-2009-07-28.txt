Public Comments
Chairman Ansell asked the Secretary to call upon the registered speakers.
The Secretary responded that there were none.
__________________________
Review and accept minutes of the meeting of June 17, 2009
Director Muñoz, seconded by Director Butler, moved to accept the minutes of the meeting of the Quality
and Patient Safety Committee of June 17, 2009. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
__________________________

Receive quarterly quality report from the Ruth M. Rothstein CORE Center
Dr. David Barker, Chief Medical Officer of the Ruth M. Rothstein CORE Center of Cook County, presented the
quarterly quality report (Attachment #1).
The Committee reviewed and discussed the information provided.
Chairman Ansell inquired regarding the integration of HIV services System-wide. Dr. Barker stated that most
of the other clinics that provide HIV services are relatively small. For example, the clinic at Provident Hospital
serves only 400 patients. He added that the CORE Center offers these clinics technical assistance with quality
assurance.
During the presentation, the subject of annual performance improvement plans for all System entities arose.
Chairman Ansell stated that The Joint Commission requires that performance improvement plans be approved
by the Board annually. He suggested that these be rolled-up into one and presented for approval, for example,
each year in the month of August. In response to the suggestion, Dr. John M. Raba, Interim Chief Medical
Officer of the Cook County Health and Hospitals System, stated that at the August meeting, a timeline on the
subject will be provided.
__________________________

Receive status report on draft recommendations for new System quality structure
Dr. Raba presented a status report on the draft recommendations for the new System quality structure
(Attachment #2).
The Committee reviewed and discussed the information provided.
In response to Chairman Ansell’s inquiry regarding when this will be finalized, Dr. Raba responded that he
expected this part to be finalized by mid-September. This will allow the Chief Medical Officers to review it at
least once or twice if they have any concerns. The next step will be to go to the local quality programs to review
their internal quality structures. Chairman Ansell indicated that he would like to have a follow-up item on the
subject at the next Committee meeting.

ATTACHMENT #1

July 2009
Patient Satisfaction Survey Report
Dave Barker, MD, MPH – CMO,

Jennifer Catrambone, MA – Director, QI & Eval

 Patient Satisfaction Survey
Thanks to…
• Jennifer Catrambone – Director, QI &
Evaluation
• Dr. Jack Kowalski – CORE Associate
Medical Director and Chair QI Committee
• Peter McLoyd – Director Peer Educators
• Our Patients who participate

12

 Caveats

13

• The most dissatisfied patients are those
you cannot survey because they have
voted with their feet – and gone
elsewhere.
• Therefore this Survey is an estimate of the
maximum patient satisfaction. Between 58% of patients exit care each year.

 History

14

• HIV Primary Care Clinics initiated ~annual
patient satisfaction surveys in 1995.
• “Home-grown” instruments used from
1995-2003 generally similar to current
survey.
• Changed in 2004 to National model survey
from HIVQUAL.

 HIVQUAL
• A program of HRSA linked to Ryan White
HIV CARE Act funded agencies.
• HIV Quality activities based on HHS
HIV/AIDS Bureau, and New York State
Department of Health AIDS Institute.
• Provides basic model survey instrument
Main Survey with validated questions

15

 Modular design
• Each clinic adopts modules that suit the
programs it provides.
• CORE is among the most comprehensive
programs in the U.S. and adopted
available modules for:
–Overall satisfaction
–Demographics
–Primary Care
–Mental Health
–Social Work
–Chemical Dependency

16

 Created Additional Modules

17

• CORE Center had to create modules for:
- Dental Services
- Health Educators
- Lab
- Nursing
- Nutrition

- Peer Educators
- Pharmacy
- Registration
- Research

• New modules created based on assessments by
managers, CORE administration, peer reviewers
and patients. Developed by Director of QI with
managers and approved by QI committee. There
are 6-16 questions per module.

 Quality of Questions
• CORE’s QI Committee reviews annual data for
internal consistency (positive and negative
responses to other questions) and makes
changes to improve patient understanding.
• Simplify questions with low response choices
(e.g. in “circle all that apply” all responses
chosen by less than 1% might be lumped into
“other” in future).

18

 Executive & Clinic Operations
Committees
• Reviews overall data, makes recommendations
about adding or deleting modules.
• In 2007 we added a module on Dental Care as
part of new Dental Peer Review
• In 2008 we deleted section on Chaplains, and
added modules on both Peer and Health
Educators.

19

 All Staff Meeting
• Results including year-over-year results
presented annually at all staff meetings.
• Underperforming departments identified and
challenged to improve. Explanations and
intentions for improvements provided to all staff.
• Summarized in clinic wide “COREspondence”
newsletter including distribution to medical staff.

20

 Survey Instrument

21

• Four years data available from current survey.
• Some changes from year to year, most
questions intentionally unchanged to allow for
comparisons.
• Questions explore patient demographics, overall
satisfaction, and 12 clinical and supporting
departments.
• Current main survey has 57 questions, plus
each patient receives 1 or 2 modules, depending
on module length

 Conduct of Survey

22

• Survey is conducted annually in September /
October.
• Typically conducted over a 2 week period.
• All HIV primary care clinic sessions are surveyed
at least once.
• Survey is distributed by Peer Educators,
available in English and Spanish. Peers will

help read questions for persons with vision or
literacy limitations.

 Conduct of the Survey II

23

• Respondents are a convenience sample of
patients waiting to be seen.
• Incentives for completing survey include candy
and a raffle ticket with a $50 gift card as the
prize
• Sample size goal is 350-450 patients or 6-8% of
census, with 439 surveyed in 2008
• Goal is 50 completed modules for each service.

 Sample

24

• Walk-in (unscheduled) patients likely to be
oversampled (longer waits to be seen).
• Possible bias to lower satisfaction among
unscheduled patients; more Chemical
Dependency and Mental Health issues
than those with scheduled appointments.
• Includes new patients and those not fully
engaged in care (unlike QA sample).

Chicago, IL 60612

Dear Partner:

Thank you for agreeing to participate in the Chicago Breast Cancer Quality Consortium. We are excited to be
starting this very important project, through which we hope to reduce racial health disparities in breast cancer in
the Metropolitan Chicago area. Over 60 healthcare institutions have agreed to collaborate in sharing data with
the aim of identifying areas for quality improvement and ultimately to save lives.

As with any quality project involving data sharing, a data sharing agreement is necessary between the parties
sharing data. Please ?nd attached a data sharing agreement for signature between the Consortium?s legal entity,
the Metropolitan Chicago Breast Cancer Taskforce and your institution. This agreement lays out the rationale
for this quality improvement project, its goals, its link to the Illinois Medical Studies Act, and the tasks that
each party will perform (including the Consortium?s obligation to refrain from publishing or disclosing any
hospital speci?c data relating to this project as enunciated in Section 1.2.3).

This agreement should be signed by a person at your institution with contracting authority and returned to:

Anne Marie Murphy, 

Director

Chicago Breast Cancer Quality Consortium
1645 W. Jackson Blvd, Suite 450

Chicago, IL 606l2

If you have questions regarding this agreement or the Consortium, please contact the Consortium?s Director,
Anne Marie Murphy at (312)942-0309 or If you have a speci?c legal question,
please contact Anne Murphy at Holland and Knight, who is serving as legal counsel to the Consortium. She can
be reached at (312)578-6544 or anne.murphy@hklaw.com.

Again, thank you for agreeing to participate in this ?rst in the nation project to reduce racial health disparities in
breast cancer through quality improvement.

Sincerely,

Anne Marie Murphy, 
Director

Title: Chicago Breast Cancer Quality Consortium

Abstract:

The Chicago Breast Cancer Quality Consortium is an initiative of the Metropolitan
Chicago Breast Cancer Task Force: an organization dedicated to tackling the black-white disparity
in breast cancer mortality across Metropolitan Chicago. In keeping with the Task Force aims, the
Consortium is speci?cally geared towards the quality of breast cancer care received in the health
care setting. In order to improve the quality of care received by all women in Chicago, the
Consortium will collect and share quality data across Chicago institutions and review processes of
care within those institutions.

Six screening measures and four treatment measures have been selected by a panel of
experts as indicators of quality that are also reasonable for multiple institutions to assess. Data on
these measures will be collected from more than 60 committed health care centers across Chicago.
The data collected will be aggregate and retrospective including women who were screened for
breast cancer or diagnosed with breast cancer from January 1, 2006 to December 31, 2006. (Name
of institution) will participate by collecting data on these measures and submitting them to the
Chicago Breast Cancer Quality Consortium.

Once the data has been collected, the data will be reviewed and reported to the respective
hospitals and the community at large. Any data shared with the community will be done so in a
de-identi?ed format: no hospital will be linked with any data that is made public. The goal is that
data will help drive quality improvement in breast cancer care for all women in Metropolitan
Chicago.

Obiective/ Hypothesis

The aim of this project is to collect and analyze aggregate data on breast cancer screening and
treatment. This data will help in assessing the quality of breast care received at (name of
institution) and institutions across Metropolitan Chicago.

By collecting and sharing data among a consortium of Chicago breast centers, we will gain insight
into improving the quality of breast care for all women in Metropolitan Chicago.

Background

According to research published in 2007, there is a large and growing disparity in breast cancer
mortality between Black and White women in Chicago. The article, authored by the Sinai Urban
Health Institute, reviewed twenty three years of data and analyzed the trend in breast cancer
mortality over this time span. In 1980, the rates were roughly similar. By 2003 however, the
mortality rate from breast cancer among Black women in Chicago was 68% higher than the White
rate]; in 2005 it was 116% higher. In response to these staggering statistics, a ?Call to Action?
Summit was held at [Name of Institution]. The summit brought together clinicians, researchers,
breast cancer survivors and other interested community members. The attendees divided into
three separate groups relevant to the three areas hypothesized to be at the root cause of the
disparity: Access to Mammography, Quality of Mammography and Quality of Treatment.
Individuals who were a part of these committees met over the course of ?ve months to assemble a
list of recommendations to the city. A report was subsequently released in October 2007 detailing
37 recommendations to Chicago in how to improve breast cancer outcomes for all women in
Chicago.

The MetrOpolitan Chicago Breast Cancer Task Force is a non-pro?t established to plan and carry
out the 37 recommendations released in the 2007 report. One of those recommendations was to
develop a Chicago consortium of breast centers that would collect and share data on breast care
quality measures, develop quality benchmarks and work together to improve the quality of breast
cancer care for all women in Metropolitan Chicago. Susan G. Komen for the Cure Foundation
funded this particular initiative of the Task Force for 3 years and in the summer of 2008 planning

for the Consortium began.

As of April, 2009, more than 60 health care centers in the Metropolitan Chicago area have agreed
to participate in the Chicago Breast Cancer Quality Consortium. (Name of institution) is one of
those hospitals and anticipates collecting and sharing aggregate data on breast cancer screening
and treatment measures as part of this quality improvement initiative.

Methods

Subjects/Selection Criteria

Sampling of subjects will include all women who were screened for breast cancer or diagnosed
with breast cancer at (Name of Institution) between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2006.

Data Collection

The following data items will be collected and reported on a standard form (See Appendix A and

B).

Con?dentiality
Only key research personnel will have access to identifying personal health information.
Treatment data (optional if using chart abstraction tool and access database)

A chart abstraction tool has been provided to assist in the chart review process. A unique study ID
will be entered onto the form which can be linked to a cross-linked ?le with names and dates of
birth in order to ensure that patients are not counted or abstracted twice. Race and ethnicity data
may also be abstracted as well as dates of service diagnosis). Dates will be used in order to
calculate the variables related to timeliness of care. Data entry will be performed using a
Microsoft Access Database system which will automatically aggregate data into counts of patients
g. number of patients with breast conserving therapy who received radiation, number of patients
diagnosed with stage 1 disease, etc.) The counts represent the final product that will be submitted
to the Chicago Breast Cancer Quality Consortium.

Reporting/Analysis

The standard data forms (Appendix A and B) will be submitted to the Chicago Breast Cancer
Quality Consortium as part of participation in this initiative.

Data Analysis will involve simple percentage calculations. The aggregate numbers and simple
percentage calculations based on these data may be included as part of a community report and
other presentations given by the Metropolitan Chicago Breast Cancer Task Force. Multiple
Chicago area hospitals will be submitting these same data from their respective institutions to be
included in the public report.

No hospital will be linked to their data in any public report or presentation; rather, each hospital
will be assigned a letter or code (example: hospital A, B, etc). Below is an example of what
information may be represented in a report.

Project Duration

Data will be collected from April 15, 2009 through December 31. 2009. The data collected will be
relevant to patients who were either screened or diagnosed with breast cancer between January 1,
2006 and December 31, 2006.

Anticipated Risks

Anticipated Bene?ts

Racial and ethnic disparities in breast cancer outcomes and survival are widely acknowledged
This research will lead to an improved understanding of processes and patterns of breast care
quality in Chicago, which in turn will have two bene?cial e?ects. First, results will point to areas
where individual facilities are excelling and may serve as a model for other institutions, and point
to areas where individual facilities may bene?t from quality improvement initiatives to improve
tracking of patient care and/or quality of care itself Second, results will inform the development
of quality improvement initiatives for breast cancer in Metropolitan Chicago as a whole.

Description of Study Ponulation

The population will include all adult women (ages 18 and older), regardless of race or ethnicity,
who were screened for breast cancer or diagnosed with breast cancer between January 1, 2006 and
December 31, 2006. There were screened and diagnosed during this
time.
