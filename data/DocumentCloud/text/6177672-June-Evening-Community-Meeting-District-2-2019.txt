The Board of Ethics
City of Detroit
Detroit, Michigan 48226

Dear Board of Ethics

I am writing to request that I be appointed to The Board of Ethics, City of Detroit.

As Senior Pastor of Greater New Mt. Moriah Missionary Baptist Church in Detroit for the past 24 years and as a
Minister of The Gospel for 41 years, I strongly believe that I am quali?ed to serve on this auspicious Board. I have
governed my life and my Ministry on the Christian Ethics and Values of Jesus the Christ and God Almighty, Who has
taught me to ALWAYS do what is right, what is just and what is fair. The Bible teaches us to follow "The Golden
Rule," which says to "do unto others as you would have them do unto you." It further says, "He has shown thee 0 man
what is good, and what does the Lord require of thee but to do justice, love mercy and walk humbly with thy God.
Ethics is doing what is RIGHT based on the universal norms of goodness, mercy, kindness, mutual respect and
tolerance for all.

Likewise, as a graduate of Morehouse College in Atlanta, Georgia (the alma mater of The Reverend Dr. Martin Luther
King, Jr.) and Colgate Rochester Cozer Divinity School in Rochester, New York (also Dr. King's alma mater), where I
received my Master of Divinity Degree, I learned ?rsthand how to apply Ethics to any given situation. One of Dr.
King's Professors, Dr. Kenneth "Snuffy" Smith, who taught him Christian Ethics and Social Policy also taught me
Christian Ethics and Social Policy. He taught me about Situational Ethics and how as a Christian Minister and Social
Justice Activist, I must always ask the question, "Am I making my decisions based on my individual biases and
opinions, or based on higher ethical norms and guiding principles that are universally accepted by civilized human
society?" Dr. King himself said, "Vanity asks the question, 'Is it popular??, Politics ask the question, 'Is it expedient?',
Cowardice asks, 'Is is safe??, and Ethics/ Morality ask, 'Is it right?'. There comes a time in everyone?s life when he or she
must make a decision not because it is popular, expedient, or safe, but because it is I have lived my life
striving to make decisions that are ethically RIGHT. Dr. King's widow, Mrs. Coretta Scott King "adopted" me as one of
her Sons in 1983 and further instilled Ethics and Values in me to NEVER forget my roots and ALWAYS treat everyone
fairly and justly and ?ght for universal human rights for the oppressed and downtrodden.

Moreover, I have worked in Civil Government as Commissioner and President of The City of Los Angeles Civil
Service Commission from 1989-1993, appointed by then Mayor Tom Bradley. I served during the City's turbulent
Riots after the infamous 1991 Rodney King Beating by the Los Angeles Police. My Commission recommended Willie
Williams from Philadelphia be appointed as the new Police Chief and helped bring stability to a City in Crisis and
unrest. When I relocated to my hometown of Detroit in 1995, then Mayor Dennis Archer appointed me as a
Commissioner of The Detroit Fire Commission. I served under Mayor Archer and was re-appointed by then Mayor
Kwame Kilpatrick. I served honorably and ethically during my entire tenure.

Finally, my work in the Interfaith Community in Los Angeles and Detroit have also shaped who I am ethically in terms
of my ability to work with The Jewish Community, The Muslim Community and other Faith Communities. I have
learned that all religions share universal ethics and values of treating all people humanely, fairly and with basic
kindness and decency. Together, these myriad experiences MORE than qualify me to serve humbly and ethically on
The Board of Ethics for The City of Detroit.

Therefore, it is against this backdrop that I humbly request that The Board of Ethics hereby appoint me as a
Commissioner on The Board of Ethics for The City of Detroit. If I can be of any further assistance, do not hesitate to
contact me on my Cell Number (313) 595-95941; via email at 

  
 
 

Sincerely Yours,

Rev?rcnd Kenneth dines Flowers.
