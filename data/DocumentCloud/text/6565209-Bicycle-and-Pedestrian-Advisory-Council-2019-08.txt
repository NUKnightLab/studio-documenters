ACTION ITEMS
No action items were presented at this meeting.
PRESENTATION / DISCUSSION ITEMS
Project Planning Reviews (PPRs) / Intergovernmental Review and Consultation (IGRC);
1st Quarter State Fiscal Year (SFY) 2020
Mr. Mike Kubek provided background on PPR and reviewed the following projects:
•

CUY – 43-1.98 (Widening Aurora Road from Solar Shopping Center Drive to Liberty
Road) – This project involves the following roadway improvements: pavement
resurfacing, minor widening, new traffic signal at Portz Parkway, multi-use path on the
south side, bike lane westbound (5’ sidewalk) on the north side, new water line and

8226c
1-1

 storm sewer. The total cost of this project is $8.1 million. No NOACA funds will be
used. Construction is expected to begin in FY 2021.
Mr. Cross suggested that the sponsor reduce the 2, 13-foot general purpose lanes to
12 feet, take the extra 2 feet and add them to the westbound bike lane.
Mr. Jim Ziemnik asked if 13 feet is sufficient for truck traffic. Mr. Kubek said yes.
Mr. Ziemnik said a buffered bike lane would provide cyclists with an extra level of
safety.
Mr. Nick Gorris suggested combining the bike lane and the walk on the left to create a
shared use path to make it safer for children in the residential area. He said the cost
of the roadway infrastructure could be reduced.
Mr. Cross said Mr. Gorris’ suggestion is worth exploring since there are not many
opportunities for people to cross Aurora Road to get to the trail on the south side.
Ms. Calley Mersmann suggested having signing and/or centerline striping on the new
multi-use path. She said if the additional shared use augmentation is not added, it
might be helpful to know if the southern trail is intended to be a two-way bicycle facility.
Mr. Cross stated that if the sponsor puts in a shared use path on the north side, they
should consider reducing the 13-foot lanes to 12 feet and add an extra foot to the
buffer on each side so trail users feel more comfortable.
•

Laketran Bus Replacement – Laketran is planning to purchase a new 35-foot zero
emissions battery electric transit bus that costs $783,500. Funds for the bus will come
from the Diesel Emissions Reduction Grant (DERG) program and Laketran. No
NOACA funds will be used.

Bike Map Update
Mr. Andrew Stahlke announced that the Lake County bike map has been completed. He noted
that maps have been printed out in the following quantities for 4 of the 5 counties in the NOACA
region:
County
Cuyahoga
Lake
Lorain
Medina

Quantity
41,500
10,000
13,000
5,000

Mr. Stahlke reviewed the process, common and unique map elements, and the project schedule
for the Geauga County map that is in the process of being updated.
Mr. Stahlke stated that staff will gather Geauga County roadway and trail data from engineers
and planners and create the first draft Level of Traffic Stress for Geauga County roadways.
ODOT Strategic Highway Safety Plan (SHSP) – Improving Pedestrian and Bicycle Safety
Mr. Kubek reviewed the following items included in the ODOT SHSP:

Mr. Anthony Ratajczak asked how ODOT will respond to the threat to bicyclists from semiautonomous and autonomous vehicle operation. He said a lot of new cars have adaptive cruise
control and lane departure control, which allow a motorist to take their hands off the steering
wheel to do something else while they are driving. He noted that bicyclists are not detected by
the sensors, making it unsafe for them to use the full lane.
Ms. Leslie Farley stated that ODOT has a partnership with DriveOhio; the automobile industry is
responsible for the development of autonomous vehicles; and Ohio has not passed any
regulations on the new technology.
Mr. Ratajczak referenced an article in the AAA Magazine about semi-autonomous vehicle
operation. In the article, it was pointed out that salesmen do not know enough about the
technology to explain it to perspective buyers and alert them to the shortcomings of the system.
He noted that owners of vehicles that have semi-autonomous features were asked what they
would be doing if they had both adaptive cruise control and lane departure control, 26% of drivers
said they would be doing something else, which is a real threat to bicyclists. He stated that more
infrastructure is needed for bicyclists that is not part of the roadway.
Mr. Cross stated that car manufacturers need to go back to the drawing board if autonomous
vehicles cannot see cyclists and pedestrians. He said it was not realistic for every road in Ohio
to have off-road facilities since the money is not there. He said he hopes legislators and regulators
are making sure the systems take into account all road users, not just motorists.
Mr. Jacob VanSickle stated that the League of American Bicyclists has been pushing legislators
to pass a law requiring autonomous vehicles pass a vision test to recognize cyclists and
pedestrians. He said he would think ODOT would follow laws for autonomous vehicles passed
by the Federal Government.
Mr. VanSickle stated that physical separation of bicycles is a plus if there are autonomous vehicles
on major arterials.
Mr. Cross stated that infrastructure alone cannot solve this issue. He said he was not confident
an autonomous vehicle would see a cyclist when making a left turn if it cannot see a cyclist right
in front of it. He said a technological solution needs to be strenuously tested before autonomous
vehicles are all over the roads.
Mr. Ziemnik asked BPAC members to reach out to their local engineers and legislators and ask
them to submit resolutions to the state so the U.S. Bike Route will be in communities throughout

8226c
1-3

 the state. He noted that ODOT will not put up signage and designate the bike routes until all the
resolutions have been submitted to the state.
Mr. Ziemnik talked about eBikes being used on trails and possibly causing a problem in the future.
ACTIVATE – NOACA’s Pedestrian and Bike Plan
Ms. Katie Sieb reviewed the following planning process phases: project launch (3 months),
regional profile (9-12 months), action plan and local tools (6-9 months).
Ms. Sieb asked BPAC members, who read the survey included in the meeting packet, to share
their thoughts.
Ms. Mersmann said she liked that the survey asked for attitudes and perceptions around funding
and implementation decisions.
Mr. Ratajczak said the survey is too long, has too many irrelevant questions, and not much
information is obtained from the person taking the survey.
Ms. Sara Maier said she did not see any questions on the NOACA survey that relate to a national
survey to see how this region is trending with others. She noted that the NOACA survey has no
options.
Ms. Joyce Braverman commented that the survey should direct people to questions they know
something about.
BPAC members were asked to take the survey at this meeting. Members provided the following
comments after completing the survey:

•

Responses made by BPAC will be different from other people who take the survey
Questions 15 and 16 are confusing, cumbersome and oddly numbered
Many of the questions on the survey are bike related – the survey should include more
pedestrian related questions
The survey is too long and will not provide the statistical data that staff may want
The survey should be vetted by another party, maybe Cleveland State University
The survey is fine – staff should let BPAC members know how they can help distribute it
Ask people if they own a bike at the beginning of the survey
Reword Question 9 so it is clear
The questions that have yes or no options should also include rarely, sometime and
often
Think about the reading ability of different populations and make the questions more
simplistic
Question 3 is confusing
Separate sidewalks from bike trails in Question 5
Add the option “all of the above” to some of the questions
Create two surveys: one for people who live in urban areas and one for people who live
in rural areas
Create a short form for a wider reach and a longer form for a fewer number of people
Add an option to Question 10 to find out if people use bikes out of need or recreation –
give people the option to provide specific locations

8226c

Question 14 seems like a throw away because everything in the NOACA region is
technically within walking distance
The survey should include questions on parking – people will not commute to a location
unless their bikes can be secured
The survey should not just be online – some people do not use or have access to a
computer – distribute the survey to businesses, such as grocery stores
Give people the option to explain why they do not bike, walk or drive

Ms. Sieb stated that the survey is just one of the elements staff will use to activate the process.
She noted that staff will be holding workshops, as well. She mentioned that people are asked to
provide their location on the survey, so staff can use that information to determine where to focus
its efforts.
Old Business
Mr. VanSickle asked staff to provide an update on the NOACA Complete and Green Streets
Policy. Ms. Sarli said the policy is still under development.
Mr. VanSickle congratulated the City of Cleveland Heights for being recognized by Smart Growth
America for having the best complete streets policy in the country.
New Business
No new business was discussed at this meeting.
Adjournment
Mr. Cross stated that the next BPAC meeting will be held at the NOACA offices on August 16,
2019 at 10:30 a.m. There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned at 11:50 a.m.

MEMORANDUM
TO:

NOACA Bicycle and Pedestrian Advisory Council

FROM:

Kathleen Sarli, Director of Planning

DATE:

August 9, 2019

RE:

Project Planning Reviews (PPRs)/ Intergovernmental Review and Consultation
(IGRC); 2nd Quarter State Fiscal Year 2020

ACTION REQUESTED
No action is requested at this time. This item is included for information and presentation.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION
Attached are PPR summary documents for the proposed projects to be presented to the NOACA
Transportation Subcommittee, Planning and Programming Committee and Executive Committee for review
and recommendation.
NOACA’s Board approved Regional Transportation Investment Policy requires that all proposed federal-aid
transportation projects be processed through PPR in order to meet NOACA’s adopted goals and federal
requirements.
PPR consists of four levels of review: NOACA staff; Board, including committees, subcommittees, and
Councils; intergovernmental review and consultation (IGRC); and public involvement. The end product of
PPR is a Board resolution that certifies that the project has had thorough review, allowing the project to
proceed to the programming stages of the planning process.
As part of the PPR process, a detailed summary of the proposed improvement and staff and committee
assessment of the project are posted on NOACA’s website, www.NOACA.org. A link to the PPRs is
included on the home page by clicking the ‘Comment on Projects’ button. Staff adds comments obtained
from the public, governmental organizations and NOACA committees as they are received. Proposed
projects are posted on the website for three months, allowing adequate time for review and comment.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Pending Board approval, the project sponsor will be notified that their project has completed PPR. NOACA
staff will work with the project sponsor to address any planning issues identified during PPR.

 RTA Fiscal Year 2020 Capital Grant Program
Sponsor: RTA
Estimated Total Cost: $54,519,373
Proposed Source of Federal Funds: Federal Transit Administration (FTA)
History/Background: RTA reports that its original state fiscal year (SFY) 2020 grant program is
listed in the NOACA SFY 2018 – 2021 Transportation Improvement Program and the majority of
the program is as originally proposed in the TIP. RTA is adding four new projects to its FFY 2020
program and the TIP. RTA is also seeking to revise and amend five existing grants to address
under-runs, over-runs, and revised priorities in its capital program impacting eleven TIP projects.
RTA’s revisions to the FFY 2019 and 2017 Capital Formula and FFY 2016 State of Good Repair
grant programs reflect these revisions.
Proposed Project: RTA is applying for various sources of funds including Section 5307 Capital
Formula, Section 5337 State of Good Repair Formula and Section 5339 Bus and Bus Facilities
Formula for FFY 2020, as described below:
•

The Section 5307 Capital Formula projects include Bus Replacement Program Vehicles
and Spare Parts, Substation Improvement Program, Cuyahoga Viaduct Track Bridge, Light
Rail Track Rehabilitation, Bus Spare Parts Program, Rail State of Good Repair, Bus
Preventive Maintenance, Enhanced Rail ADA (Americans with Disabilities) Access, NOACA
Unserved Areas Projects, (new) Rail Car Replacement Program, (new) Track Bridge over
Conrail and (new) HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) System Improvement
Program.

•

Section 5337 Rail Formula projects include Substation Improvement Program, Cuyahoga
Viaduct Track Bridge, Light Rail Track Rehabilitation, Rail Spare Parts Program, Rail State
of Good Repair Projects, Rail Preventive Maintenance, Rail Infrastructure Program, On-Call
Rail Engineering, OCS (Overhead Catenary System) Rehabilitation Program and (new) Rail
Utility Vehicle Prime Mover Replacement.

•

Section 5339 Bus and Bus Facilities Formula projects include Bus Replacement Program
Vehicles and Spare Parts.

RTA is also seeking to revise and amend five existing grants to address updated funding amounts,
projected under-runs, over-runs and revised priorities in its Capital Program as described below:
•

2019 Section 5307 Capital Formula Grant – The grant is being revised and amended to
account for decreased funding as well as to decrease Bus Preventive Maintenance and
NOACA Unserved Area funding, shift Bus Vehicle Type funding, fund the West 117th Street
Track Bridge and its Rail Car Replacement Program.

•

2019 Section 5337 State of Good Repair Formula Grant – The grant is being revised and
amended to account for decreased funding as well as to decrease Rail Preventive
Maintenance and West 117th Street Track Bridge funding and fund the Rail Car
Replacement Program.

•

2019 Section 5339 Bus and Bus Facilities Formula Grant – The grant is being revised and
amended to account for increased funding and to increase the funding for Bus
Replacement Program Vehicles.

RE:

SAVE: NOACA’s Plan for Transportation Safety

ACTION REQUESTED
No action is requested at this time. This item is for information and presentation only.
BACKGROUND
NOACA has recently completed SAVE Plan; NOACA’s Plan for Transportation Safety. The purpose of the
SAVE Plan is to save lives in the NOACA region by identifying actions to reduce the most severe crashes
that too often result in fatalities and serious injuries. The SAVE Plan was developed with the vision that traffic
deaths and injuries can be prevented with appropriate planning, policies and programs, with a long-term goal
of reducing the number of fatalities and serious injuries by 50% by the year 2040. The SAVE Plan provides
direction that will enable NOACA and others to work together to set goals and work toward the vision this
Plan establishes for the region.
Achieving a safer transportation network requires addressing the interaction among the infrastructure,
vehicles and the skill and behavior of travelers. The SAVE Plan incorporates a “6 E’s” approach into the safety
planning process, acknowledging the key roles that engineering, education, enforcement, emergency
response, evaluation, and equity all play in preventing severe crashes and saving lives. After evaluating 10
years of crash data to identify trends, ten emphasis areas associated with fatal and serious injury crashes
were identified.

RE:

2017 NOACA Safety Priority Lists

ACTION REQUESTED
No action is requested at this time. This item is for information and presentation only.
BACKGROUND
One of the important elements of each year’s Regional Safety Program is the identification of regional
safety priority lists. NOACA safety priority locations were developed by evaluating historical crash
performance at intersections and along roadway corridors. The safety priority lists consider the total
number of all crashes and the combined number of just fatalities and serious injuries (FSI’s) that have
occurred at intersections or along one-mile defined-length corridors that make up the region’s non-freeway
road network.
Emphasis is placed on prioritizing safety at locations that experience fatalities and serious injuries, in order
to align NOACA’s priorities with the safety performance measures established under the current federal
transportation funding bill (the FAST Act), which requires states to measure progress in reducing the
numbers of fatalities and serious injuries.
Priority lists were developed in five specific areas on review of crashes occurring during the five-year period
from 2013 to 2017:
1. Intersection FSI (based on a minimum of 4 or more FSI crashes)
2. Intersection Frequency (based on all intersection-related crashes)
