Before we proceed with the agenda today, I?d like to take a moment to remind you that we
are still looking for feedback on our public participation process. We have a survey up on
cpsboe.org, and we had copies of that survey at the registration desk today. As we think about
redesigning the process, it?s important that we hear from people like you, people who have
navigated the current process and can offer constructive criticism. We also have an update from
Board Member Rome who is leading the Whole Child Committee.

Board Member Rome provided the following remarks:

I?m excited to be leading this Committee on Whole Child, and as we start planning out our
sessions that will start later this fall, I want to make sure this Whole Child Committee encompasses
topics that not only interest Board Members and the CPS leadership team, but also that the topics
are driven by familieS, by educators, by community members and by students. To that end, we
have a survey that was passed out at registration so we can make sure the committee meets your
needs. There is a set of topics on the survey, and we encourage you to write topics that are not
there and that are of interest to you. The survey can be returned to the box on the registration
table on your way out. It is also on the Chicago Board of Education website. So we encourage you
to use your voice and let us know what interests, what topics interest you the most and I
appreciate your feedback.

President del Valle provided the following remarks:

And in future Board Meetings you?ll hear from other chairs of other Committees who will
have announcements or reports on the work of the Committees. So you can count on that to be
part of our regular agenda as we move into the school year. We will have more information on this
and other Committees, at the September Board Meeting.

PARTICIPATING CHARTER AND CONTRACT SCHOOLS: See attached Exhibit A.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION:

The Board of Education of the City of Chicago (?Board") desires to develop a common online, mobile?
friendly application platform for all public high schools and CPS programs throughout Chicago including
charter schools and contract schools (?High School Application Redesign? or Application Redesign?).
The key bene?ts to having a single, common high school application would be to simplify the process
for families and increase equality of access; provide more transparent admissions decisions and offers;
know students? school decisions earlier which enables having the right resources in the right schools on
day one; and provide additional data on students? preferences to inform strategy and planning for the
district. The application and transfer processes for the HS Application Redesign shall be centralized at the
CPS Of?ce of Access and Enrollment for all district operated schools, contract schools, and charter schools
that opt-in to the HS Application Redesign.

The Board desires to enter into an MOU for the HS Application Redesign with the charter high schools that
have opted into the CPS launch phase and application period of the HS Application Redesign for 9th grade
students entering high schools in the Fall of 2018, and the Fall of 2019, the Fall of 2020 and beyond by
amending their existing school agreements to delegate authority to the Board to conduct the application
process and the lottery, if necessary, on behalf of the charter schools.

To achieve the objectives of giving applicants their highest possible choice in light of applicant movement
between the time when offers are extended and the start of the new school year and (ii) ensuring accurate
school ?nancial management in light of annual student attrition, the district shall be allowed to develop 9"1
grade offer numbers at contract and charter high schools listed in Exhibit A based on procedures that are
comparable to non-selective enrollment high schools in the district.

When there are more 9th grade students accepted through the HS Application Redesign and enrolled in
the high schools listed in Exhibit A by the 20th day of the CPS semester up to a maximum of 10% above
and beyond the maximum student enrollment number in such schools? agreements (?Additional 9"1 Grade
Students?), the Board desires to make payments to those schools for such Additional 9th Grade Students.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING WITH CHARTER SCHOOLS: Under the MOU, the district shall
be allowed to develop 9?h grade offer numbers at the charter schools listed in Exhibit A based on procedures
that are comparable to non-selective enrollment high schools in the district. This authorization is contingent
on charter high schools each opting into the High School Application Redesign.

Charter high schools that have signed on to High School Application Redesign are agreeing to comply with
the updated CPS enrollment and transfer processes as documented in the Board?s Policy on Enrollment
and Transfer of Students in the Chicago Public Schools adopted April 26, 2017 (17-0426-PO1), as may be
amended, and the Board?s Admissions Policy for Magnet, Selective Enrollment and other Options for
Knowledge Schools and Programs adopted April 26, 2017 as may be amended.

August 28, 2019

TERM OF MOU: The MOU shall commence on July 27, 2017 and shall end on Wthe expiration
date set forth in each school?s current charter school aqreement.

EXISTING CHARTER AND CONTRACT AGREEMENTS: This Board Report authorizes the
amendment of the existing agreements for the charter schools and contract schools listed in Exhibit A as
set forth below, effective as of July 27, 2017; however, written amendments are not required:

a. Amend Section 4.d. or in particular the Enrollment and Application Process/Lottery
subsections, of their existing Charter School Agreements to delegate authority to the Board to conduct the
high school application process and the high school lottery, if necessary, on behalf of the charter schools
and to allow the district to develop 9th grade offer numbers at the charter high schools listed in Exhibit A
based on procedures that are comparable to non-selective enrollment high schools in the district.

b. Amend Section 4.d, Enrollment, and Exhibit A-II.B., Student Population, of their existing Contract
School Agreements to allow the district to develop grade offer numbers at the contract high schools
listed in Exhibit A based on procedures that are comparable to non-selective enrollment high schools in the
district.

COMPENSATION: Payments are authorized (per-pupil funding and all other necessary local, state and
federal government funding) for Additional 9th Grade Students underthose schools? existing Charter School
Agreements and Contract School Agreements in the event there are more 9th grade students accepted
through the HS Application Redesign and enrolled in the schools listed in Exhibit A by the 20th day of the
CPS semester up to a maximum of 10% above and beyond the maximum student enrollment number in
such schools' agreement (?Additional 9"1 Grade Students?). In the event the Board provides district?run high
schools with additional funds to offset 9th grade enrollment declines attributable solely to the availability
and performance of the HS Application Redesign, the Board shall provide additional funds in the same
manner to charter and contract high schools listed in Exhibit A that experience 9th grade enrollment
declines that can be attributed solely to the availability and performance of the HS Application Redesign.

AUTHORIZATION: The Board's President and Secretary are authorized to execute the written
Memorandum of Understanding for the High School Application Redesign and amendment with the charter
high schools listed in Exhibit A. Additional charter schools may participate in the HS Application Redesign
and execute the Memorandum of Understanding and amendment without amending this Resolution. The
Board's General Counsel is authorized to include other relevant terms and conditions in the Memorandum
of Understanding and amendment, including any indemnities to be provided to the charter high schools.
The Board?s President and Secretary are authorized to sign any amendments to the charter and contract
school agreements in connection with the HS Application Redesign, subject to approval as to legal form by
the Board?s General Counsel. The Executive Director of the Office of Innovation and Incubation or his/her
interim designee is authorized to sign any ancillary documents required to administer or effectuate the HS
Application Redesign, including those required by the Illinois State Board of Education.

LSC REVIEW: Approval of Local School Councils is not applicable to this report.
FINANCIAL: The ?nancial implications will be addressed during the development of the 2018-2020 ?scal
year budget. Since the School Code of Illinois prohibits the incurring of any liability unless an appropriation

has been previously made, expenditures beyond FY19 are deemed to be contingent liabilities only, subject
to appropriation in subsequent fiscal year budgets.
