Mr. Glass provided an overview of the Report on the CountyCare Health Plan. The Committee reviewed and
discussed the information.

•
•

Metrics
Transition Update
Committee Follow-up Requests
MCCN Contract Amendment #2
- Approved Value-Added Benefits.

Cathy Bodnar, Chief Corporate Compliance and Privacy Officer, presented the Corporate Compliance
Report for the Committee’s information (Attachment #3).
During the discussion of the summary of Contract Compliance for the new vendors, Board Chairman
Hammock inquired further regarding the minority and women-owned business enterprise participation
percentages for Valence Health; he wondered why the percentages appear low. Chairman Lerner requested
that the administration ask for further information from Valence Health on their diversity format.
Mr. Glass and Ms. Bodnar provided further information on complaints and grievances. It was noted that Ms.
Bodnar’s report is through the 3rd quarter of 2015; that period does not include statistics relating to the
transition to Valence Health, as that transition occurred after that reporting period. Ms. Bodnar stated that
some of the grievances they have seen following the transition include those relating to confusion with phone
numbers, getting to providers and care coordination - a lot of general questions to re-direct. The transition
had a bump, but issues that have come through have been very manageable. Mr. Glass stated that staff
members who were on-site at the call center when the operation went live reported that there was nothing out
of the ordinary that occurred with the transition; there were no systemic failures. Board Chairman Hammock
requested that Mr. Glass summarize that in a brief fashion for the Board.

 Unique Challenges for Illinois Medicaid
• Lack of State Budget
– IL Medicaid Redetermination Project

• Immature managed care program model
• No carve-outs; All-in benefits
– Unique among states to include LTSS & LTC

• Outdated infrastructure to support managed
care needs
• Evolving understanding of covered benefits
– Especially substance use/DASA services
Page 10 of 35

CCHHS BOD Strategic
Planning: CountyCare
May 19, 2016

 What does this mean for
CountyCare?
• Big shifts in industry & regulations require vigilance to
understand impact on service delivery and health plan
requirements
– Assessments of network, reimbursements

• Size is essential to competing & influencing
– Limited organic growth in IL Medicaid market; Three main options:
1. Merger/acquisitions (large growth)
2. Service line expansion (medium)
3. Service area expansion (limited)

– Need scale of enrollment to fulfill community obligations (i.e. ‘big
enough to matter’)

• Innovation is key to long-term success

 Five Strategic Planning
Principle Objectives
#1: Improve Health
Equity

Health equity is achieved when every person has the opportunity to attain his or her
full health potential and no one is disadvantaged from achieving this potential
because of social position or other socially determined circumstances.

#2: Provide High
Quality, Safe &
Reliable Care

The quality of patient care is determined by the quality of infrastructure, training,
competence of personnel and efficiency of operational systems. The fundamental
requirement is the adoption of a system that is ‘patient centered’ and the
implementation of highly reliable process.

#3: Demonstrate
Value, Adopt
Performance
Benchmarking

Benchmarking creates a strong foundation to measure transformative change. It
allows us to have a fact-based understanding of where we are and how we are
succeeding at reaching our goals.

#4: Develop Human
Capital

Our 6,270 employees are our biggest asset. Building employees’ skills through
education and development opportunities should not only improve efficiency and
quality of care, but staff and patient satisfaction.

#5: Lead in Medical
Education & Clinical
Investigation

Cook County has a rich history of medical training and top notch clinical research,
particularly for vulnerable populations. This legacy is an important component of our
system to maintain our workforce pipeline and develop effective innovations in care.
