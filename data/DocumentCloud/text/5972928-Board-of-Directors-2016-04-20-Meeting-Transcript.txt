commenced at 10:37 a.m.)
MR. LINGENFELTER:

All right.

I think we'll

4

get started if I could ask folks to take seats.

5

I am not Treasurer Summers.

6

with us this morning, but we will go through the

7

agenda as stated.

order this meeting of the Chicago Infrastructure

Trust Board of Directors.

He is unable to be

So I would like to call to

We have a good solid

10

substantive agenda this quarter I guess.

11

of good progress on both the Smart Lighting

12

Project, the Home Buyer Assistance Program in

13

particular, as well as strategic plan review that

14

we are very excited about.

15

A lot

So without further adeu first order of

16

business is approval of the minutes from January

17

27th, 2016.

Is there a motion to approve the

MR. LINGENFELTER:

Oh, Damon Silvers on the

phone, okay.

4

MR. SILVERS:

Yes, I'm sorry to do this, but

5

there's -- there are two places where what I said

6

in the last meeting just wasn't accurately

7

recorded.

8

with this later?

9

Should I note them here or can we deal

MS. DARLING:

10

MR. FALK:

I think we can --

Maybe we can just have Damon

11

e-mail a mark up of the transcript and we can get

12

it corrected.

13

MR. SILVERS:

14

misunderstanding.

15

that would save us time here.

16

Yeah, it's just like a
If I could do it by e-mail,

MR. LINGENFELTER:

Yes, I just wanted to review

22

the calendar for the rest of the year.

So we are

23

looking at July 19th, October 18th and December

24

6th.

I did want to make the Board aware those

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - April 20, 2016

1

are all the same dates that we discussed in

2

January.

3

only thing that could be a small additional

4

emergency meeting or a need for an emergency

5

meeting would be if we get to the end of the year

6

and need to approve the selection of the vendors

7

for the Smart Lighting Project.

8

not fit exactly in with the schedule, but that

9

has to also go to City Council.

But I did want to let you know that the

That may or may

So we will know

10

more as the project continues and I will keep you

11

updated, but I did want to just put that on your

12

radar screen.

Thank you.

MR. LINGENFELTER:
comments?

Okay.

Any questions or

Document retention policy.

MS. DARLING:

This is a policy that is just

16

a corporate best practice that is something as an

17

Illinois nonprofit we should have.

18

we -- the Chicago Infrastructure Trust has not

19

had such a policy.

20

were subject to the Freedom of Information Act,

21

etcetera, I thought it would be prudent to adopt

22

such a policy.

23

reviewed by Scott Falk and has been submitted to

24

you for your approval.

This is a policy that was

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - April 20, 2016

1

MS. HUBBARD:

Just a question, is this in

2

line with other document retention policies for

3

the -- for the City and State?

4

MS. DARLING:

It's very different than the

5

City because they're subject to other laws as a

6

government body which we are not, but it's very

7

similar to policies at nonprofits.

8

MS. HUBBARD:

9

MR. LINGENFELTER:

10

Okay.
Any other questions?

Is

there a motion to approve?

11

MR. RAMIREZ:

You have a motion.

MR. LINGENFELTER:

Motion by Director

MR. LINGENFELTER:

MS. DARLING:

Opposed?

Great.

Motion carries.

Now, I'll just do a

18

very, very quick Trust operations update.

Last

19

time we met in January George had -- George

20

Marquisos who had just joined us as Managing

21

Director and I had introduced you to Patricia

22

Dominguez and she was going to be joining us in

23

February to help us run our office and be a

program coordinator.

She has since joined us and

right now.

A program analyst for the Home Buyer

We have also advertised for some interns.

7

hoping to get those folks on.

those get posted.

14

So I will keep you updated as

We brought to you last time in January

19

it's very important to have good benefits at the

talent.

We were promised a

It is exactly that.

We think

Also coming up is Infrastructure Week

18

in May.

And wanted to just make you aware this

is a national week of events and media and

20

education and advocacy to bring infrastructure

21

and elevate infrastructure into more of the

22

national conversation.

23

24

other infrastructure accelerators, agencies

During this week I have

are popping up all over the country.

3

in Colorado, the West Coast Infrastructure

4

Exchange, which you may have heard of.

5

all convening for a couple of days early in that

6

week and I will keep you updated about that.

There's one

We are

7

But, also, you know, I spoke to you

8

last time about some possible grants available

9

and so we are going to be figuring out how to

10

advocate for those.

So keep you updated on that.

11

Unless anybody has any questions, we can move on

12

to the more exciting parts of our agenda.

13

MS. CAFARO:

14

MR. LINGENFELTER:

15
16

Thank you.
Questions?

Okay.

Next

item is the Strategic Planning Project.
MS. DARLING:

So at this point we -- you

17

have received these documents in advance of this

18

meeting.

19

who you all were so generous to meet with and

20

spend some time with during his succumbment to

21

the CIT with the Civic Consulting Alliance.

22

have a wonderful partnership with CCA and Tom did

23

incredible work for us and put together in

wanted to give a chance for us to have a

table.

He's since gone

Antonio, do you want to come up to the

10

MR. BENECCHI:

11

MR. BUDESCU:

Morning.
Okay.

So in the last board

12

meeting in January we sort of gave a very

13

high-level overview of what the scope of the

14

engagement was and where we are at the time or

15

where we were at the time.

16

back and sort of, again, talk a little bit about

17

the scope and show where we've progressed.

18

And so I wanted to go

The goal is we entered the engagement

19

was to help define and clarify the Infrastructure

20

Trust strategic and operational framework.

21

critical elements were to help define the scope

22

of CIT activities, the project selection

23

framework and the operating model.

24

phase of the project focussed on meeting with the

The

The initial

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 10

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - April 20, 2016

1

Board and additional key stakeholders to get

2

feedback from the stakeholders to insure that the

3

vision of the framework put in place matches what

4

the stakeholders have in mind.

5

And we also created a project steering

6

committee which was led by Secretary Summers as

7

well as Deputy Mayor Steve Koch; Carol Brown, the

8

City FCO; CDOT Commissioner, Scheinfeld; and

9

David Narefsky from Mayer Brown.

And as we

10

gathered all the feedback the second phase of the

11

engagement really after the last meeting in

12

January was to focus on crafting a strategic and

13

operational plan that was responsive to the

14

vision of the CIT stakeholders.

15

of the market constraints that the CIT faces, but

16

still was ambitious and achievable.

17

mid March we finished the engagement.

18

we'll give a review of the results of that

19

engagement.

20

But also aware

And as of
And so

So the initial step of crafting the

21

framework required synthesizing the stakeholder

22

feedback that we are seeking the Board and the

23

additional stakeholders to provide a guiding

24

mandate and principles.

And so we laid them out

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 11

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - April 20, 2016

1

here.

2

Chicago Infrastructure Trust leverages

3

alternative finance and delivery structures to

4

expand the capacity of the City and other

5

government agencies to deliver new and improved

6

existing infrastructure.

7

We sort of see the mandate as being -- the

I think we've honed in on three

8

guiding principles.

We want to provide

9

complementary services as a response of the needs

10

of the City and its sister agencies.

11

this one is really critical in that we don't want

12

to just chase ideas that seem good on paper in

13

terms of maybe they are creative financing, but

14

we want to be aware of what the City's needs are.

15

And I think

And in order to remain relevant I

16

think the projects that the CIT needs to pursue

17

have to be relevant to what its clients are which

18

in this case is the City and the sister agencies

19

and maybe other regional government entities.

20

want to insure value to the City and the sister

21

agencies and ultimately the taxpayers on the

22

delivery of infrastructure projects.

23

know, we want to act as a dedicated specialized

24

resource for alternative project delivery to the

We

And, you

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 12

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - April 20, 2016

1

City and its sister agencies.

2

I think what ultimately came out of

3

some of these conversations as well is that we

4

wanted to take a broader approach and this means

5

both in terms of an asset class.

6

going to focus on transportation on energy, but

7

again be a bit more agnostic about asset class

8

and more responsive to the actual needs of the

9

City.

10

We are not just

And then ultimately we wanted to look

11

beyond public private partnerships.

And when we

12

say that that's not to say that we don't want to

13

continue pursuing public private partnerships

14

with the right projects given the right

15

opportunities, but have a broader focus in

16

attempting to assist in facilitating

17

infrastructure delivery through any available

18

delivery structure not just P3's.

19

So, you know, it was critical to -- in

20

order to pursue this new strategic vision, it was

21

really critical to establish a tangible value

22

proposition for the Infrastructure Trust in order

23

to create a viable strategic framework.

24

this value proposition is really driven by a

And so

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 13

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - April 20, 2016

1

course set of what we think of as the potential

2

specialized resources and capabilities of the

3

Infrastructure Trust.

4

resources and capabilities that we have targeted

5

here are really driven by the conversations we

6

had in the initial stage of the engagement when

7

we had the conversation with each of you and

8

additional stakeholders to start thinking about

9

what is it that the CIT could do to provide value

And these specialized

10

to the City and the sister agencies that they

11

don't already do.

12

And so I think we've come up with a

13

high-level list here that the subject matter

14

expertise I think the CIT very much can act as a

15

shared resource for the City and the sister

16

agencies with expertise in alternative financing

17

and delivery structure.

18

shared resource, it can reduce the learning curve

19

on complex projects where each department doesn't

20

have to start learning each one of these

21

structures from scratch and reduce inefficiencies

22

in the delivery of such projects, and having a

23

City partner that's fluent in the language of

24

this alternative financing world.

And by acting as the

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 14

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - April 20, 2016

1

As well we think the CIT can act as a

2

transformative idea incubator.

By focussing

3

specifically on infrastructure and infrastructure

4

delivery, the Infrastructure Trust has more

5

bandwidth to be aware of what are the innovative

6

ideas going around the country and the world and

7

be able to find the ones that are most relevant

8

to the City and bring them here in a way that

9

currently the City and the department and

10

agencies within it might not have the bandwidth

11

to spend enough time on those issues.

12

I think Project Aggregation is a

13

really great one.

The CIT is in a unique

14

position to act as a platform for Project

15

Aggregation whether it's between departments and

16

agencies or even a little broader

17

jurisdictionally in the region to be able to say

18

by aggregating these similar projects and

19

bundling them together, you can achieve greater

20

economies of scale on these projects.

21

think Retrofit One was an example of that and the

22

streetlights project that Leslie will spend some

23

more time discussing is another great example of

24

that.

And I

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 15

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - April 20, 2016

1

Project management, I think this kind

2

of ties in as well with the project aggregation.

3

The CIT is really well positioned to manage

4

multiple -- multi-agency, multi-departmental

5

projects that tend to perhaps linger because

6

there is not a single champion for the project

7

especially in the processes and procurement

8

forward.

9

really brings bandwidth and expertise to the City

And in doing so, you know, the CIT

10

to be able to push these projects forward.

11

think, again, the streetlights project is a great

12

example of that.

13

And I

And then finally, access to private

14

capital.

15

assist government agencies and -- in determining

16

the suitability of certain projects to access

17

private capital and if they are suitable in

18

determining the best structure in order to

19

leverage private capital.

20

I think the CIT is going to be able to

And I think ultimately what these

21

specialized capabilities lead up to the value

22

proposition both to the public side and the

23

private side.

24

goal is to say we will help enable governments --

On the public side I think the

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 16

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - April 20, 2016

1

government agencies to accelerate project

2

delivery, reduce project costs and enhance value

3

to taxpayers.

4

you know, creating consistent and transparent

5

processes, having a fluent -- a partner fluent in

6

alternative delivery structure and hopefully

7

expanding the regional pipeline and creating more

8

work for the private sector in infrastructure in

9

the Chicago region.

And on the private side I think,

10

So, you know, I think in pursuing our

11

strategy we want to take a look at a broad range

12

of project structure and also aim to reduce the

13

reliance on City funding.

14

range of project structure goes back to the point

15

where we said public private partnerships are

16

great; but if we want to be viable, we need to

17

look at other structures as well.

18

that there is a bit of a constraint on the PPP

19

market and Chicago revenue concessions are

20

projects in which the private sector is given the

21

right to the future revenues of an asset and then

22

they use that revenue stream to finance the

23

capital costs.

24

pay for themselves in this matter.

And so the broader

The reality is

There are not many projects that

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 17

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - April 20, 2016

1

And the other structure you've been

2

seeing a lot around the country is called an

3

availability payment structure.

4

payment structure is really based on an

5

appropriations pledge from the government agency

6

to pay a stream of payments over a 30- to 50-year

7

period.

8

the private lenders take on both an

9

appropriations risk, but also the construction

An availability

And an availability payment structure is

10

risk and operations risk of an infrastructure

11

project.

12

the ratings for the project that tend to be at a

13

minimum three notches below the general

14

obligation rating of the public agency procuring

15

the project and they tend to need to achieve

16

investment grade rating.

And what that generally means is that

17

And the reality is in the short term

18

that constraints be the amount of projects that

19

can be looked through the lens of an availability

20

payment structure in the region.

21

MS. DARLING:

So I think that these are

22

things that in the future we will look at as, and

23

poor Tom, has heard me say this so many times;

24

but it's something that's in our toolbox, but is

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 18

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - April 20, 2016

1

not where we are going to focus our attention.

2

And we'll be looking at projects where we can

3

provide other alternative delivery structures to

4

the City that aren't necessarily a classic public

5

private partnership.

6

MR. BUDESCU:

And so, you know, we sort of

7

tried to think, well, what are some of the

8

additional structures that might fit the role of

9

the Infrastructure Trust.

And I think the very

10

intuitive one is the Retrofit ESCO Project where

11

you've already seen the Trust execute on Retrofit

12

One, and it's a similar idea behind what is being

13

structured with the Streetlight Program.

14

know, looking at asset redevelopments to unlock

15

additional infrastructure improvements of transit

16

oriented development and things of that nature.

17

You

And I think there's, you know, the

18

other there is a pretty big bucket.

But I think

19

we want to just really think about what are

20

innovative ways to help expand the pipeline of

21

infrastructure projects and improvements in the

22

City.

23

So one thing that, for example, would

24

fit in there is assisting with implementation of

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 19

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - April 20, 2016

1

something the MPC has been pushing which is

2

transit value capture.

3

pushing the legislation and to say if something

4

like that happens, I think that it's the kind of

5

thing that the Infrastructure Trust could really

6

assist in implementing on a project.

7

You know, they've been

And so on the operational side, you

8

know, we -- one of the main goals on the

9

operational side is to reduce the reliance on

10

City funding.

And in order to do so we have

11

thought about it in multiple revenue streams.

12

There's the revenue streams associated with the

13

core operations.

14

core operational revenue stream, we're

15

specifically thinking about project transaction

16

fees when we deliver a project successfully to

17

close.

18

play an oversight role either in the construction

19

And when we think about the

And then additionally there's other

CIT services that include things like the Home

23

delivering an infrastructure project, but aligned

24

with the mission of the CIT and also providing

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - April 20, 2016

1

surplus revenues for the core operations.

2

And finally I think we want to pursue

3

some federal and philanthropic grants as Leslie

4

had mentioned.

5

is that the Infrastructure Trust can play a wide

6

range of roles on projects.

7

where we wanted to be responsive to the feedback

8

from the Board and the stakeholders to say it's

9

important to remain agile with the goal of being

So, you know, I think our vision

And, again, this is

10

as responsive as possible to the City and

11

agencies on each specific project.

12

outlined examples of roles we could play

13

throughout the lifecycle of an Infrastructure

14

project.

15

comprehensive list, but I think it gives an

16

indication of the broad capabilities that we

17

envision the Infrastructure Trust having.

18

that's from going from idea incubation, reviewing

19

unsolicited proposals or coming up with ideas,

20

preliminary and technical analysis to say is this

21

even a feasible idea or project to move forward.

22

So we sort of

And that's not to say that this is a

And

Then the procurement in financing

23

where I think, you know, there is a lot of meat

24

there for the Infrastructure to do.

And then

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 21

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - April 20, 2016

1

some oversight and financial oversight roles and

2

the project construction and operations and

3

maintenance.

4

And so I think we talk a lot about

5

leveraging the broad mandate, but we also thought

6

it was very important to remain focussed on the

7

projects that make the most sense for the

8

Infrastructure Trust.

9

filtering program to help the CIT prioritize its

So we created a sport

10

work as it builds its pipeline.

You know, we

11

wanted to make sure that the projects are aligned

12

with the mission of the CIT.

13

to say is there a case to be made from the

14

project economics to drive innovative financing

15

or delivery structure?

16

feasible?

17

in that the public agency?

18

there is an interest on the private side to say

19

this is a project worth pursuing and investing

20

our resources in?

21

the CIT to pursue in terms of does the amount of

22

resources required to pursue it make sense given

23

the scale and impact of the project?

24

ultimately what's the capacity to provide the

And then we wanted

Is the project itself

Do we think that there is partner buy
And do we think that

Is the project reasonable for

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 22

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - April 20, 2016

1

necessary resources in order to execute the

2

project?

3

So I think we gave some version of

4

this slide the first time around.

I think now

5

it's in a little more context.

6

of based on the conversations we've had with all

7

of you as well as the Strategic Planning Process,

8

have laid out some short-term, medium-term and

9

long-term goals for the Trust.

You know, we sort

I think in terms

10

of the organizational structure, we want to

11

initially focus on the critical needs and then

12

build out the resources over time to build out a

13

mature organization.

14

Operational funding, as we discussed

15

this is a really big one.

16

really want to establish the revenue stream and,

17

you know, getting the Home Buyers Association

18

Program up and running, getting the Streetlights

19

Projects closed.

20

revenue stream and ultimately with the hope of

21

becoming completely self-funded.

22

In the short term we

And then over time expand those

You know, we want to establish and

23

further develop the capabilities we had talked

24

about in the previous slides.

Continue to expand

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 23

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - April 20, 2016

1

the specialized subject matter expertise we have

2

in terms of institutional knowledge and

3

eventually become a critical resource for the

4

City and the sister agencies.

5

And I think in terms of projects our

6

initial focus right now is we really want to

7

execute what's on our plate and demonstrate our

8

value to the City and the sister agencies.

9

then over time take on a more ambitious note.

10

Okay.

And

And then so, finally, want to

11

talk a little bit about the operational plan to

12

-- that's been put in place to support the

13

strategic goals and that's a phase build up of

14

our internal capabilities.

15

at four primary drivers for the development of

16

our capabilities.

17

project experience over time, institutional

18

knowledge development and enhanced interactions

19

with clients in industry.

20

And so we've looked

Targeted experience, hirings,

And I think what we found is that to

21

build out the subject matter expertise and

22

project management -- and really our capabilities

23

in the short term, it's going to have to really

24

come -- depend highly on targeting experienced

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 24

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - April 20, 2016

1

hires.

And then over time I think the Trust can

2

rely more on building out its institutional

3

knowledge and project experience to supplement

4

the knowledge of the initial hires.

5

MS. HUBBARD:

So these are hires within CIT?

6

MR. BUDESCU:

Yes.

7

MS. HUBBARD:

Potential.

8

MR. BUDESCU:

Potential hires, yes.

9

MS. DARLING:

So thank you, Tom.

We really

10

appreciate all your work.

11

would like to open it up if there is any

12

discussion.

13

MR. LINGENFELTER:

Okay.

And so I think we

You talked a little bit

14

about thinking more broadly beyond just, you

15

know, transportation and energy, given some of

16

the other ideas that may be in that incubation

17

period, what do you think of?

18

MR. BUDESCU:

Yeah, I think it's really

19

going to depend on what the City needs, but I

20

think you are seeing right now in general in the

21

infrastructure market domestically where it was

22

previously very much focused on transportation, a

23

broader social infrastructure focus.

24

though, you know, you are seeing courthouses,

Even

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services

 25

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - April 20, 2016

1

civic centers go up around the country using

2

innovative delivery structures.

3

think that's where the expansion is really come

4

more domestically on the social infrastructure

5

side.

6

we don't want to box ourselves in to these are

7

the only projects we do.

8

actually need them, you lose relevancy.

9

to say if the City is in need of help on a

You know, I

I think here locally it's more to say that

And if the City doesn't
And more

10

complex project, the Infrastructure Trust is a

11

resource that would be able to assist.

12

MR. LINGENFELTER:

Okay.

Comments?

13

Questions?

I guess I just would like to add

14

though Leslie's thanks to Tom and Anthony and to

15

the Consulting Alliance and the commercial club

16

more broadly and I think the mission of this

17

entity is to try to bring together the private

18

sector and labor and the government agencies to

19

find a way to accelerate investment in this.

20

And, you know, the City asked Leslie

21

and the Board to define a much crisper mission.

22

What is our core policy?

23

Where should we with a real focus on execution.

24

And so, you know, you guys have really helped us

Where can we add value?

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 26

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - April 20, 2016

1

do that.

And so and all of the stakeholders that

2

you interviewed and took the time to contribute

3

to this, it really enriched this process.

4

thank you to everybody involved.

5

MS. DARLING:

6

MR. LINGENFELTER:

7
8
9

So

Thank you very much.
Next items are project

updates, Leslie.
MS. DARLING:

Sure.

So I want to be

cognizant of everyone's time.

So as you all know

10

on Monday the Chicago Infrastructure Trust

11

released part one of our Street Lighting RFQ-P

12

which I have forwarded to all of you.

13

result of a rather painstaking due diligence

14

process that was really beneficial to shaping the

15

financial document that we released on Monday.

16

We worked with eight City departments and the

17

park district.

18

This was a

I am actually -- I asked First Deputy

19

Commissioner of the Department of Transportation,

20

Kevin O'Malley, to join us here as well today.

21

He's probably our closest stakeholder because

22

CDOT operates and maintains the City streetlight

23

system.

24

kind of the largest City stakeholder.

And so I asked him to join us today as
But we

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 27

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - April 20, 2016

1

worked closely with so many departments, the park

2

district.

3

be by the Department of Energy.

4

with Michael Poplowski on the West Coast and Rose

5

Jordan from the MEEA, Midwest Energy Efficiency

6

Alliance, who have provided pro bono service to

7

us and technical expertise.

8

with the private sector has been a huge part of

9

what we've done here because we did the RFI last

We were assisted ably and continue to
We are working

Obviously partnering

10

fall and the results of that gave us a tremendous

11

amount of industry feedback which was incredibly

12

helpful.

13

And then we've spent a lot of time

14

talking to other municipalities who have worked

15

-- who have also implemented LED conversions in

16

their cities.

17

not the earliest or first adopter on LED

18

conversion, we've had the opportunity to learn

19

from other cities like New York and many other

20

large cities including Los Angeles.

21

been really pleased to learn best practices from

22

them and really help us formulate the RFQ that we

23

were able to release this week.

24

And because the City of Chicago is

And we've

So I think there is a lot of questions

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 28

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - April 20, 2016

1

about what is smart lighting.

2

lighting is, of course, lighting that can be

3

controlled as I will talk about in a few minutes

4

and what the project actually is.

5

And so smart

But the other reason that it is smart

6

lighting is because we have taken a tremendous

7

amount of time in what Tom has described as a

8

complex project, and we've been able to figure

9

out how to do a project delivery for the City

10

that we think makes sense for the City and for

11

taxpayers.

12

project.

13

This is going to impact the nighttime experience

14

for everyone who lives and visits -- lives in and

15

visits Chicago.

16

change.

17

And we want to be smart about that
We want to deliver the right project.

And it is going to create a

So right now there is that orange glow

18

in the City that you are all very used to.

That

19

will change with this conversion.

20

to make sure that we are engaging stakeholders

21

and the communities throughout the City to make

22

sure that we are getting it right.

23

priority for the City and for the CIT to make

24

sure that we deliver this project in a -- in a --

And so we want

It's a huge

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 29

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - April 20, 2016

1

the right way.

2

to make sure that we are getting community

3

feedback and addressing that feedback as we go

4

through this process.

5
6

So we are going to take our time

MS. HUBBARD:

So the question I think --

Can I ask two questions about

the RFQ before we get into this lighting project?

7

MS. DARLING:

Of course.

8

MS. HUBBARD:

Did we send the RFQ to

9

everyone who responded to the RFI or is it open

10

to anybody even if they did not respond to the

11

RFI?

12

MS. DARLING:

13

wants to respond.

14

responded to the RFI, did get an e-mail with the

15

link where we said now it's available.

16

all aware of it.

17

tremendous amount of attention both in the

18

industry press and also the local press.

19

the word is out.

20

The RFQ is open to anyone who
We did, however -- anybody who

They are

And it has received a

And so

As of this morning we had over 50

21

people responding saying that there are document

22

holders and that they will be at our presubmittal

23

conference.

24

for prompting me on that, Kim, because we will be

And so that's actually -- thank you

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 30

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - April 20, 2016

1

having a prebidder conference on May 3rd at the

2

new Malcolm X College Conference Center that will

3

be -- registration will be at 9:30.

4

o'clock is the -- we will start the presubmittal

5

conference.

6

At 10:00

It's also a networking session because

7

we want to encourage minority and women owned

8

businesses and small businesses to participate in

9

this program.

And so we want those teams to be

10

able to all meet each other as they decide how to

11

form their teams and they'll have a few weeks

12

after that because the submittal will be due on

13

May 20th.

14

MS. HUBBARD:

And that was my second

15

question to expound upon the language in the RFQ

16

that consists upon minority and women owned

17

participation.

18

MS. DARLING:

We asked every respondent to

19

supply what their plan would be to meet the

20

commitment goals of the City of Chicago.

21

following the guidelines that the City of Chicago

22

has set for this project which is 26 percent

23

minority participation and 6 percent women

24

participation.

We are

And that we are going to follow

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 31

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - April 20, 2016

1

the exact rules that the City has.

And, of

2

course, those are goals; but those are -- we're

3

following the City's guidelines.

4

MS. HUBBARD:

Thank you.

5

MS. DARLING:

So what the project is is

6

after all of the work that we did, what we --

7

where we think the project lies is we think we

8

can deliver better lighting, better service and

9

better safety in the City of Chicago by

10

converting approximately 85 percent of the City's

11

lighting fixtures over to LED's.

12

approximately 270,000 lights.

That's

13

In addition to that what we think that

14

that's going to -- as I mentioned that's going to

15

change the color of the light and provide

16

excellent visual acuity that you don't see now.

17

It will help make our streets safer.

18

save energy.

19

are going to pay for this; we know that a

20

conversion to LED saves 50 to 75 percent off the

21

energy bill.

22

leverage those savings to pay for this project.

23

And we'll also have or the RFQ seeks

24

It will

And we know that, which is how we

And so we are going to use and

to have an implementation of the lighting

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 32

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - April 20, 2016

1

management system which is controlled by a node

2

on the top of the light.

3

determining how many of those we would get and

4

what that would look like, but that lighting

5

management system will provide realtime

6

information on outages.

7

better service comes in because right now the

8

City relies on individual citizens to call in to

9

311 or Aldermen to call in to CDOT to ask for

And we are still

And that is where the

10

lights to be changed over.

11

light management system that we would like to

12

install, we believe that we will have realtime

13

outage information.

14

MR. SCOTT:

15

MS. DARLING:

16

MR. SCOTT:

And now with this

Alderman.

You said 270 lights total?
270,000.

Sorry, 270,000.

How many of

17

those are park district lights and how many of

18

those are --

19

MS. DARLING:

20

MR. SCOTT:

21

MS. DARLING:

Those are all City lights.

All City lights.

Okay.

Those are all City lights.

22

The park district has about -- and George can

23

help me here, but I think that they have

24

approximately 20,000 lights that would be a part

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 33

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - April 20, 2016

1

of this conversion.

2

are all -- the 270 is the City; is that right?

3

MR. MARQUISOS:

And I don't -- I think those

That's correct.

And the

4

20,000 park lights, again, the reason we're not

5

saying let's change 100 percent is we are not --

6

there are certain kind of specialized lights, if

7

you will, we will call them euphemisms

8

particularly ornamental.

9

readily available to convert those to LED.

And the products aren't
So

10

once we get the common light fixtures changed and

11

we will see how much money -- the financial

12

capacity we have left to do the remainder.

13

park lighting infrastructure has about 50

14

percent.

15

MR. SCOTT:

16

MR. MARQUISOS:

The

Ornamental?
Yes, ornamental and

17

different kinds of lights.

18

there's a question mark as to how many of those

19

are actually going to qualify.

20

our bets as to how many lights the parks are

21

going to be.

22

MS. DARLING:

So we're still --

So we are taking

23

pathways, Alderman.

24

this.

And it's primarily park
So that would be a part of

It wouldn't be stadium lighting or

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 34

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - April 20, 2016

1

additional kinds of lighting.

2

question?

3

Did I get your

And then in addition we want to make

4

sure that when we are partnering with the City to

5

get these lights installed, that we are putting

6

in an LED lamp head on a pole and wiring that can

7

withstand having that lamp head for its lifespan

8

which is 10 to 15 years.

9

are planning to do targeted infrastructure

So that means that we

10

stabilization which means that we will make sure

11

that that wiring and the pole can handle that

12

lamp head.

13

And so this isn't a project that we're

14

-- that is about aesthetics.

So it won't be

15

something that necessarily makes everything brand

16

new, but it will stabilize the infrastructure to

17

make it more reliable and provide a better

18

quality of light.

19

MS. HUBBARD:

And this may be something

20

that's to be determined, but I would assume that

21

the lighting brightness consistency is the same

22

throughout the whole City in every neighborhood?

23
24

MS. DARLING:

Well, actually the system

would allow us to make changes throughout the

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 35

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - April 20, 2016

1

City, neighborhood by neighborhood.

2

able to implement it as we would like, it would

3

give us some flexibility in that arena to use

4

dimming, etcetera, that would give us some other

5

opportunities to do different things in different

6

neighborhoods.

7

If we are

The other thing we would like to do is

8

we want to make sure we are driving innovation

9

and using technology appropriately to deliver

10

better services as part of this project.

11

a section in our RFQ where we are interested in

12

learning about other innovative smart city type

13

ideas.

14

constraints of this project, they have to be

15

budget neutral or budget positive.

16

very open to them.

17

time talking to some educational institutions and

18

other labs that may be interested in partnering

19

with us.

20

funding opportunities.

21

We have

However, based on the financial

So we are

We are also spending some

So we are looking at grants and other

This is the procurement schedule.

So

22

I don't need to go through it.

But as I already

23

said the responses are due May 20th to the RFQ.

24

We will hope to short list in end of June, early

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 36

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - April 20, 2016

1

July and hopefully bring some selected vendors

2

back to you at the end of this year with the goal

3

of first quarter of next year starting to do the

4

conversion.

5

So, George, can I ask you to talk a

6

little bit about the execution plan going

7

forward, anything I haven't covered so far.

8
9

MR. MARQUISOS:

Sure.

So this whole

question that Leslie brought up in her earlier

10

slide about what is smart lighting or why do we

11

keep talking about this and are we opening

12

ourselves to confusion with the smart city

13

initiative and all that kind of stuff.

14

So ultimately we are hoping that the

15

Trust provides value in trying to bring

16

everything in here as per its strategic plan to

17

kind of really be thoughtful about how we

18

implement this program.

19

by the Trust, but it's very much a City of

20

Chicago program.

21

Transportation program.

22

that.

23

to implement it in a way that is going to be, you

24

know, drive the most benefit to the City.

So it is being overseen

It's a Department of
Let's be clear about

And we are trying to figure out a strategy

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 37

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - April 20, 2016

1

We've checked in with all the major

2

municipalities as to what they've done and there

3

is a wide variety of approaches on how you

4

implement this kind of modernization.

5

for example, had Mayor Bloomberg give an

6

announcement and basically said we are going LED

7

from this point forward, more to follow.

8

they basically implemented with very little

9

community input or communication strategy.

10

New York,

And

We think that Chicago is a different

11

context in that we have concerns about safety and

12

our lighting is such an integral part and we're

13

used to a lot of lighting, and the result of this

14

more directed light is going to change the

15

environment.

16

process in place for not only soliciting input on

17

what the neighborhood experience is, what's good

18

and what's bad about it; but also kind of

19

communicating now how things are happening, why

20

decisions are being made, how they are being

21

made, what balances were achieved.

So we feel like there has to be a

22

So in addition to the RFQ-P process

23

that is kind of like the overarching execution

24

plan, if you will; we are committed to doing a

lot of things in parallel, right.

2

trying to formulate a communication strategy

3

that's going to be very involved with the

4

Aldermen who are the representatives of their

5

constituency and who get all the calls about the

6

lighting.

7

So we are

We are going to be talking

8

concurrently about what are the financing options

9

here.

So ultimately we're saying we are going to

10

pay for this from the savings, but who are we

11

paying, right?

12

-- so there's some attractive ideas out there

13

from the Department of Energy and other sources

14

and we are trying to see what we could qualify

15

for and bring the best value from a cost of

16

capital if you will.

17

What is the financing going to

Lighting specifications, I am pretty

18

sure a lot of people here are very interested in

19

like what is -- how much light are we going to

20

deliver with these LED's and where are you going

21

to put that light and what color is that light

22

going to be?

23

a lot of people have very strong opinions about

24

and information about.

Those are very critical issues that

And so we want to be very

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services

 39

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - April 20, 2016

1

thoughtful and smart about how we give the

2

vendors what we want, what the City of Chicago

3

wants in their lighting.

4

for us to say, okay, this is our HPS bulb, give

5

me an LED equivalent that does the same thing,

6

let me know how much it costs.

7

really quickly and save all this time and energy

8

and just -- give me a swap out.

9

It would be very easy

We could do that

That I believe is not what we consider

10

smart lighting, right.

We want it to be -- we

11

have an opportunity here as we convert to this

12

digital technology to do something that I think

13

is -- provides something of a higher quality than

14

what we had in the past.

15

require some very thoughtful conversations.

16

we're lucky as Leslie has alluded to earlier,

17

this whole fact finding due diligence process

18

that we have been through the last five months; I

19

cannot tell you how many different entities have

20

come forth with like enthusiastic offers of help.

21

There's a lot of people out here who want us to

22

get this right be it the private sector, other

23

municipalities, the Department of Energy.

24

is the largest lighting project in the country

And that's going to
And

This

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - April 20, 2016

1

and a lot of people are looking at it.

If

2

Chicago does it right, then it could drive the

3

way other things are going.

4

there is a responsibility here.

5

be thoughtful about it.

6

at CDOT and the Department of Information

7

Technology.

8

figure out how we are going to deliver a process

9

that really -- and we don't have all the answers

So we recognize
We are going to

We have great partners

I am confident that we are going to

10

today.

11

are beginning to understand the questions pretty

12

well.

13

I can tell you that right now.

But we

You know, the other two bullet points

14

we talked about targeted infrastructure

15

improvements, right.

16

to change out every pole and every wire.

17

that for sure.

18

resources that kind of reduce the failure rate.

19

So where is the things that are really going to

20

make a meaningful difference.

21

make those kind of assessments, we are going to

22

have to have better information about the

23

condition of the lighting infrastructure.

24

know where every pole and light is, we got it

We don't have the resource
We know

So where do we direct our

And in order to

down to a GPS point.

2

we can't tell you the condition of each one of

3

those lights and the wire that feeds them.

4

are going to have to do some level of asset

5

assessment that informs how do we target our

6

limited resource to have the biggest impact.

7

those are all things that are going on in

8

parallel to the RFQ-P.

9

do you have anything more you want to --

10

MR. O'MALLEY:

We can put it on a map, but

So we

So

And, I don't know, Kevin,

No, I would just like to echo

11

what George has said about not having all the

12

answers yet.

13

we need yet, but I want to commend them for

14

putting together a procurement process that I

15

think is really going to help drive that

16

information gathering and drive competition and

17

innovation and cost through the marketplace.

18

I think that's important.

We don't have all the information

So

19

There is a really thoughtful process

20

here that is being laid out and I think it will

21

help us make our decision and make it right for

22

the City of Chicago.

23

MS. DARLING:

Thanks.

24

MR. LINGENFELTER:

So is that infrastructure

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 42

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - April 20, 2016

1

assessment part two?

2

the final round bidders with that infrastructure

3

assessment or is coupled with --

4

MR. MARQUISOS:

So we are going to provide

It would be great if we

5

could do that; but given the fact that we have

6

220,000 poles, the actual timing of going out and

7

assessing the condition of each one of them is

8

probably -- so we are -- right now CDOT has kind

9

of an independent track to kind of get that going

10

separately from this program.

11

once we short list our people, we are going to

12

bring their input into can we get some of that

13

asset condition from them as they are doing

14

installations, right.

15

sources of collecting the data and kind of -- as

16

we know more, we're able to kind of better assess

17

what we should do.

18

MS. DARLING:

But we are also --

So we want to do multiple

Different cities are handling

19

it very differently on how they are doing their

20

infrastructure condition assessments.

21

MR. MARQUISOS:

And that all ties into the

22

project phase.

So do we give one contractor all

23

the lights and have it done in a year or there's

24

evidence to suggest that every time you bid out

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 43

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - April 20, 2016

1

these kinds of things, the bids get better and

2

more competitive.

3

technology gains that are happening in the

4

lighting industry, but as people learn more about

5

how this actually gets implemented realtime real

6

-- in the City, they get more competitive in

7

their quotes.

8

discussion that is still going on.

9

want to make sure that people understand we are

10

taking the responsibility seriously and we have

11

really good people at the table to help us.

12

And not only because of the

So we have a whole project phasing

MR. LINGENFELTER:

So I just

And I think that's

13

actually a critical strategic function of the

14

Trust is to cut through that uncertainty that the

15

private sector has around all of these government

16

agencies.

17

that in the timing.

18
19
20

So I am glad that we thought about

MS. DARLING:

Any other questions on street

lighting?
MR. SILVERS:

Can I just get in for a

21

second?

I don't have a question.

I just want to

22

say though I think this is really impressive.

23

think the approach that you all have outlined in

24

terms of both thinking about the technology, the

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

I

 44

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - April 20, 2016

1

financing and the kind of -- I don't know the --

2

the dialogue with the community, I think all

3

these things are really good.

4

here to really -- to really take advantage of

5

what people call second mover advantage in this,

6

to be able to learn what other people have done,

7

have done well and done poorly is really -- is

8

really very smart.

9

is a potential here to do something that would

And the potential

And the implic -- and there

10

have real consequences nationwide.

11

want to say I am impressed by what the staff has

12

done.

13

MS. DARLING:

14

MR. O'SHEA:

And so I just

Thank you.
I would just like to say myself

15

and my colleague, Alderman Scott, have a unique

16

perspective in that at any given point we have

17

hundreds and hundreds of street and alley lights

18

out in our communities.

19

this out for you, there are some folks that they

20

just like to look out their window and know that

21

the streetlights are on.

22

then there are some folks that Chicago gangs have

23

control of their corner and if that block or

24

those several blocks around the lights are out, I

And just to kind of lay

They felt safer.

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

And

 45

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - April 20, 2016

1

can assure you serious violent crime is going to

2

take place.

3

And Kevin will echo this in that when

4

it's a problem on your block, you don't want to

5

hear the excuse, you don't want to hear this is

6

going to take weeks at times with the amount of

7

outages that we have with the condition of the

8

infrastructure that we have in our streetlights

9

it can take weeks.

And when you have a gang

10

problem on your block or you've been the victim

11

of a crime, you want it fixed.

12

now.

13

within hours.

And I can't begin to tell you how

14

excited I am.

This is going to be

15

groundbreaking.

16

county is going to say, wow, Chicago did it and

17

Chicago did it right.

18

MS. CAFARO:

This will fix it now.

You want it fixed

This will fix it

This is something the entire

Alderman, I mentioned to Leslie

19

that our own University of Chicago crime lab is

20

working on a lot of studies regarding lighting

21

and crime with a lot of data and maybe we can

22

interact with them.

23

the lights are out, there is more crime.

24

they're working with New York City in part in

I mean, there is the obvious

their lighting and I would hope maybe we could

2

leverage some of their knowledge and information

3

too as we start thinking about the project.

4

MS. DARLING:

So.

I really appreciate you

5

bringing that to my attention, Debbie.

6

reached out to the Mayor's Office to ask -- they

7

work with the U of C crime lab consistently.

8

I want to make sure that we make that connection.

9

MS. CAFARO:

I already

So

So if they have information

10

that we could benefit from, that would be just

11

additive.

12

MS. DARLING:

13

the streetlights?

Thank you.

14

MAN IN GALLEY:

15

MS. DARLING:

Anything else on

Could I ask a question?
We are going to have public

16

comment at the end of the meeting.

So then

17

moving on quickly we could just cover where we

18

are with the Home Buyers Assistance which is a

19

program that was approved by the Board at the

20

January meeting.

21

very lengthy process to get the program up and

22

running and we are just about there.

23

hoping to provide a lender list to the community

24

by May 1st.

Since then there has been a

We are

There are still some legal documents

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 47

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - April 20, 2016

1

to finalize and then the lenders have to be

2

approved by the City before the program can

3

actually launch.

4

But we are really excited that the

5

City has asked us to assist them in helping to

6

make homeownership possible for low and moderate

7

income families.

8

percent of the total loan amount based on income.

9

And you can receive a grant for up to 7 percent

12

13

credit scores, etcetera; but each lender will

14

handle that slightly differently.

15

excited to be launching that in early May.

16

again, we have the job posting up for the program

18

internally for us.

20

And it can also be

So we are very
And,

So we are really excited to

In the meantime the Mayor's Office and

21

Treasurer Summers' Office has been doing a

22

terrific job to spread the word on this project.

23

The Mayor has held or is in the process of

24

holding six service fairs of which the Home

2

of that -- of those.

3

been doing tremendous outreach for which we are

4

really grateful for in helping spread the word

5

both to neighborhood housing community groups and

6

lenders and banks, etcetera.

7

hopeful that the program will be well received

8

and we'll be able to help more people get into

9

homes with this down payment assistance.

10

And Treasurer Summers has

So we are very

So I just wanted to show you what our

11

role is going to be as the program administrator.

12

And we'll be primarily administering a grant

13

process and coordinating with lenders and the

14

escrows received to release funds and working

15

closely with the City.

16

these, but I'm happy to share this with you.

17

After the meeting and just make sure you are up

little more challenging than I had hoped to close

this thing out.

impact 60 buildings, 114 separate projects.

As a reminder it was -- it did

that have a couple of punch list items yet.

20

We have issued final acceptance certificates to

again, in the next couple of weeks.

get everything on it -- get everything done, but

shortly.

Bottom line is I expect to have this

So it's

So that and then I will give you a
brief update about the performance period.

So

10

once you implement energy efficiency measures,

11

you enter what is called the performance period.

12

And this one has a 14-year performance period,

13

right.

14

what they promise we would save, we would

15

actually save.

16

demonstrate it on an annual basis.

17

received the first round of reports for the stub

18

year.

19

to December of 2015.

20

reporting that they have met or exceeded the

21

guaranteed savings they promised.

reviewing those reports.

with them, but we are kind of negotiating that.

So the ESCOs are guaranteeing us that

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - April 20, 2016

1

The good news is that where savings

2

were somewhat less than we had hoped in certain

3

areas, they were the result of getting the

4

building automation system right.

5

complicated things when you automate the

6

operations of a building.

7

operating correctly, it's taking a heating season

8

and a cooling season and another heating season

9

in order to get them right.

There are

And now that they are

They are in fact

10

exceeding the level of savings that were

predicted.

12

in excess of what was predicted.

13

news.

14

So we expect 2016 the savings will be
So that's good

The other part that we are still

working on is going after rebate incentives.

state was going to pass a budget.

5

my update.

6

So that money I think

Okay.

That's

Yes.

MS. CAFARO:

Do we typically require

7

holdbacks so that punch list items and things can

8

be more easily finished?

9

MR. MARQUISOS:

Yes, we have 10 percent

10

retention.

And so that's why those final pay

11

applications have not been issued.

12

MS. CAFARO:

Okay.

13

MR. LINGENFELTER:

Thank you.
If nothing else then I

14

think that concludes the project updates and our

15

formal business.

16

Since I know we have a few folks, I would like to

17

ask folks who haven't addressed the Board

18

previously to go first.

interested in that, maybe come up and sit here at

over it.

We have a small speech

I understand it has to be less

So good morning all, to the Board, my

name is Justin Julian and I am a student here at

on a mission to hopefully change Chicago forever.

We

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - April 20, 2016

1

don't even have the same friends, but there is

2

one thing that brought us here together and that

3

is our interest in the night sky.

4

that Juan and I see in Chicago is not the same

5

one that previous generations of Chicago have

6

looked at.

7

But night sky

When Juan and I and other Chicago kids

8

look up and see the visible stars like a

9

constellation such as Leo, many stars are

10

missing.

11

once was.

12

The night sky in Chicago is not what it
And we fear that it is dying.
Something that is causing our night

13

sky to be stripped of its former glory, it is

14

also causing harmful changes to natural habitats

15

of many species including our own and that

16

something is light pollution.

17

have an opportunity to drastically reduce light

18

pollution in Chicago and the night sky.

19

And we right now

The Board also has the power to bring

20

back the stars for not only myself, Juan and

21

other Chicagoans.

22

to introduce of his own.

23

him to do so and thank you so much.

24

And Juan also has some words

MR. CHAVIRA:

Thank you, Justin.

Good

2

morning, my name is Juan Chavira and I am here to

3

introduce to you the world of light pollution.

4

Light pollution is a brightening of the night sky

5

caused by man-made light sources such as

6

streetlights.

7

Now, I am not suggesting that we get

8

rid of streetlights, but what I'm suggesting is

9

that Chicago streetlights need to be properly

10

shielded.

Full cutoff lighting also its -- also

11

as it's known directs light downward where we

12

need it and out of the night sky.

13

lighting is smart lighting and smart lighting is

14

what we are here today to discuss.

15

now we are all wondering does it really matter

16

that some light escapes into the night sky?

17

Well, to be frank with you, ladies and gentlemen,

18

that depends on what you value.

Full cutoff

I assume by

19

Light pollution clouds the night sky

20

covering millions of stars and our planets from

21

our view.

22

people have come to love, draw inspiration from

23

and rely on.

24

is unfair and will harm them more than we can

2

imagine.

3

We are here today because the Board is

4

about to purchase on behalf of all Chicagoans a

5

tremendous number of streetlights.

6

that purchase I hope you consider that the

7

sustainable Chicago environment the Mayor wants

8

cannot be achieved by LED energy savings alone.

9

When you make

Research out of Stanford and other

10

universities is showing that light pollution is

11

impacting human health in significant ways and we

12

cannot simply wait for the next time Chicago

13

replaces its lights to do something about it.

14

then another generation of kids would have grown

15

up under a dome of artificial light.

16

entire generation of Chicagoans would have grown

17

up without ever seeing a star unite in Chicago.

18

By

By then the

In closing, I wish to thank you for

19

your attention this morning and to encourage you

20

to support the procurement of the dark sky

21

friendly lighting and fulfillment of the task

22

ahead.

Thank you.

National Highway Safety Council -- National

Highway Safety Council came up with statistics

that only 1 in 31 headlights are designed

on the design or appearance of the lighting

11

Another difficulty is that adversity

12

affects lighting is that manufactures use root

14

The blue white light with the blue tint is good

2

for lighting for homes or in sports stadiums, but

3

not good as a streetlight.

4

becoming the most common streetlight, the problem

5

is that the blue light scatters the most.

6

produces a five fold increase in light pollution.
