From the time a Bid Package is made available to bidders until the
recommendation for award of the contract is approved by the Board, no bidder
shall communicate with another bidder regarding the subject matter of the
procurement, with the sole exception of communications a bidder may have with
a minority or women owned business enterprise to meet requirements of
minority or women owned business enterprise goals.
Such quotations shall not be solicited or provided in a manner that
discloses or requires the disclosure of the amount of a prospective bid.
(i)
Purchases and Contracts of $100,000.00 or more or contracts for
contractual services of $25,000 or more. Bids to conform to conditions in
advertisements.
(1)

The County Board will not entertain or consider any bid; a.

Addendum issued to all bidders by the Purchasing Agent; b. Not
accompanied by the required certified check, bid deposit, or bid
bond; c. Not accompanied by the affidavits, certifications or
economic disclosure statements required to be submitted
pursuant to this article; or d. Which in any other way fails to fully
comply with the terms and conditions as stated in the
advertisement for bids.

(2)

No bid may be changed, amended, or supplemented in any way
after the exact time for submission of bids specified in the
advertisement for bids. Any bidder that cancels, withdraws or
modifies its bid after the bid opening will result in the bidder being
deemed unqualified and will prohibit said bidder from receiving a

opening. No certified check, bid deposit, or bid bond may be
accepted after the exact time for submission of bids specified in
the advertisement for bids.

after the opening thereof. If it is evident that only one qualified bid has been
submitted with respect to a particular contract, no bid envelope is opened and
any sealed bid(s) shall be returned to the bidder(s) via certified mail unopened.
The Clerk announces this fact and that the Purchasing Agent will thereafter
determine whether to re-issue the solicitation of competitive bids as a result. If it
is determined that an error was made in announcing the bid or there was a
failure to read all bids into the record, the Purchasing Agent shall notify the
Commissioner who presided over the Bid Opening and the Clerk of the Board of
the need to reconvene the Bid Opening to correct the record. As soon as
reasonably possible, the Bid Opening is reconvened for the purpose of
correcting the record.
(k)

contractual services of $25,000 or more; Evaluation of bids. Immediately after
the Bid Opening, a post bid meeting is scheduled wherein the Department and
Contract Compliance reviews bids for technical specifications and minority

of a recommended vendor from the Department and Contract Compliance, the
Office of the Purchasing Agent prepares the pre-award bids report and posts
said report on the County's web-site and on the bulletin board outside the
Purchasing Agent's Office. The time intervals required to evaluate bids are not
always predictable. Bidders are responsible for monitoring the web-site or, if
they lack web access, for calling the Office of the Purchasing Agent on
