In addition to the bene?ts granted to members and spouses each month, the Secretary will also be
presenting, for informational purposes only, items of interest that may affect our members. Questions
regarding any member?s speci?c situation should be addressed directly to the Fund Of?ce.

NEWS AND INFORNIATION FROM THE FUND SECRETARY

There continues to be some misinformation and confusion among the members concerning how the recent 3% 7
Annual AutOmatic Increase (AAI) is being implemented.

The pension board has implemented all the bene?ts found in the recently passed legislation, . Certain
retired members have taken exception that they were not granted the retroactive calculation. There does exist a
group of approximately 214 retired members that did not receive a retroactive calculation. The reason for not
granting the AAI retroactive calculation for these 214 members is that the language found in PA99-0905 clearly
states that members already receiving the AAI are not entitled to the retroactive base calculation. 1 underlined
the pertinent language taken directly from the pension code as follows:

Any fireman born before January 1, 1966 who qualifies for a n?nimum annuity and retires
after September 1, 1.967 but has not received the initial increase under this subsection
before January 1, 2017' is entitled to receive an initial increase under this subsection on
(1) January 1, 2017, (2) the first anniversary of the date of retirement, or (3) attainment
of age 55, whichever occurs last, in an amount equal to 3% for each complete year following
the date of retirement or attainment of age 55, whichever occurs later.

 

I understand why it was written the way it was, the drafters intended to grant a retroactive calculation of the base
annuity up to the time the member was eligible for the AAI. However, this was the ?rst time the retroactive
calculation was ever introduced into our pension code. In my opinion, the real problem here occurred during
the process of drafting the language; quite simply, it was drafted poorly. Because the language was drafted
poorly, 214 retired members who have already started receiving the AAI are not entitled to the retroactive
calculation. Was this the intent of the legislators? I don?t think so, but that is what they very clearly wrote into
the law. The crux of the problem is that the pension board was faced with implementing new poorly drafted
language that was not ambiguous on its face. But, stakeholders that were involved in the drafting interjected
?legislative intent?, which then creates some ambiguity. The law is clear on its own; it is Without ambiguity. But
adding ?legislative intent? to the discussion creates ambiguity. Intent is subjective and dif?cult to
interpret. Clear concise language leaves no room for subjectiveness. Bene?ts should not rest on terms that are
subjective or dependent on the interpretation of intent.

It is important that pension fund members are aware of the process and deliberations of the Pension
Fund. Do members feel comfortable with a Board granting bene?ts that clearly aren?t supported by law but
feel compelled to follow the direction of two legislators that run counter to the language passed? If it is ok for
the trustees to ignore any portion of the clear language of the pension code in this instance, would they be able
to ignore the pension code in other instances?

In my opinion, as Fund Secretary, I felt the Board had the following Options in front of them when deciding this

matter:

The Board could ?le for a declaratory judgement with the courts. This would essentially ask the
judge to clarify how the pension board should apply the law. As a trustee, I wanted to pursue this avenue
so the members affected know that the pension board trustees are attempting to get to a resolution that
is at least bound by some legal authority. I wanted reach out to the Police Pension Board to join us in
the proceeding because initially they were also struggling with how to interpret the
legislation. However, since that time the Police Pension Board has now decided that the language in
their code is ambiguous and that is adequate to grant the bene?t in favor of the member.

Let Local 2 sue the pension fund. The Board can wait for the court to rule should Local 2 decide to
?le a lawsuit. Local 2 has communicated to the FABF Board that they would pursue a lawsuit on behalf
of the 214 affected members to make certain the benefits in question are granted. If the courts instruct
the pension board to grant the bene?t, I am confident the pension board would abide by that order.
Change the law. This would be the best alternative, but because the law didn?t have the support in the
Executive Branch and the required support in the Legislature has diminished, it isn?t believed that any
legislative change can be achieved.

Grant the bene?t based on the letters from two legislators. The Board felt that was not an option
because we would be violating our ?duciary obligation to all members of the pension fund by granting
bene?ts that clearly aren?t supported by law. In my opinion, by doing so, younger pension fund
members could bring a suit against the Board for not acting as a fiduciary for their interests in the
fund. They could successfully argue that the Board, by granting bene?ts not supported by the pension
code, caused them harm by diminishing the security of their future bene?t when the Board deliberately
and recklessly misallocated fund assets that could be used to pay their future bene?ts.

Get additional letters from Legislators clarifying the intent of the language. Although this might
be persuasive, the Board couldn?t decide what exactly such a letter would have to say and how many
legislators would be required to sign it to show the entire Le gislature?s intent.

The actions your Board has taken thus far shows a cautious, independent, deliberate body, that has made an
effort to decide this matter in an open and transparent manner. Currently the Board has decided to leave their
initial interpretation of the pension code stand.
