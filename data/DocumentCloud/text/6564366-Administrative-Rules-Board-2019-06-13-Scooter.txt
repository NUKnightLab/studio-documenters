 What is
Bike/scooter
share?

• An innovative transportation program where
system subscribers have access to bikes or
scooters through self-service locations around
the community via cell phone apps
• System subscribers sign up to pay per ride or for
memberships
• Bike/scooter share is ideal for short distance
point-to-point & last mile/first mile trips
• Devices can be picked up and dropped within
the area’s network.
• They are easy to operate and the process to
locate and use them functions through an app

 • Launched in September
2016 with 250 bikes and
30 stations with goals to
expand in the near future
• Funding came from
NOACA’s TLCI grant and
local match
• Current private operator
is Cyclehop
• Cyclehop owns 100 bikes
and County owns 150
• Contract with Cyclehop
ends in 2021

UH Bikeshare

• Bikes are “docked” –
meaning they have to be
locked to a station or
something else – fence,
etc.

 Bikeshare
Revolution!

• In 2017, the bikeshare world
changed drastically with the
introduction of ‘dockless’ bikeshare
and scooter share – companies
grew out of and started out of
China, then moved to large US
cities
• A few private companies
developed bikes that could lock to
themselves and be placed/left
anywhere – no station or
organization required – and began
to drop bikes in major cities all over
the world

 Initial Lack of
Regulations

• When companies first began cities did
not have regulations for it… leading to
some chaos because of the nature of
the bikes – i.e. the ability to leave them
anywhere and the abundance of them

• Since then, cities have worked with
companies to develop permitting
schemes and other regulations

Our (draft) Expansion/Regulation Plan
1. County creates County wide licensing
system for bike, ebike and scooter sharing
operators
• Proposed $5k a license (to County) and .15c a
ride (to Cities).
• Proposed minimum amount of bikes and
scooters per permit (150) but no max.
• Minimum rebalancing requirements in
identified locations.

4. Bikes etc. can ride anywhere in the
County, but local governments can enforce
their own laws or opt out of the program.

2. County signs MOU agreements with
interested cities. We would agree to share
per trip fees with these municipalities for
local expenses. Muni’s other than
Cleveland will agree to refrain from
creating their own permitting and /or
licensing systems in exchange for funding
through this program.

5. Future - RFP with NOACA dollars will
subsidize ONE vendor and infrastructure
for bike share network expansion. (Note:
$250k must be spent in Cleveland and only
on infrastructure.)
• Bikes ~$500 per bike
• Ebikes ~$1500 per bike
• HUBs ~$1000 per station

3. City of Cleveland will be the ONLY city
that can force operators to get a Right of
Way Permit ($250) in addition to getting
the County license.

6. Future -County Bike Network
Sponsorship rights
• “UHBikes” naming rights (w/ Cyclehop)
expire in December, 2019.
• County could take over developing
sponsorship work for the network and
use the money to supplement needs of
operators and expand the network.

 (draft) License
Requirements/Regulations
• Exhibit A of the draft ‘License
Requirements’ document
• Safety, Maintenance (rebalancing,
vandalism), Parking, and Data-sharing
Requirements

 Details from Operator License
1. Indemnity: The scooter share
company holds harmless the
County, any municipality it
operates in within the County,
and any entity with a rebalancing
location on its private property.

2. The operator must have a
minimum of 150 scooters which
are routinely placed outside of
the city of Cleveland.

3. This license does not give the
operator exclusive rights to
operate a scooter share program
in the county.

4. Since this is going to be a
station-less program, a 25%
discount on fare will be given as
incentive to park at a preferred
parking station as designated by
the county.

5. Insurance: Scooter share
company must maintain workers
compensation, Commercial
general liability, and Business
Automotive liability insurance

contract.
