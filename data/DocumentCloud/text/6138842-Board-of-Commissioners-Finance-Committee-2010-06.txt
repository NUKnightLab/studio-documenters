Proposed Substitute Resolution sponsored by Edwin Reyes, Joseph Mario
Moreno and Joan Patricia Murphy, County Commissioners; Co-Sponsored by
Earlean Collins and Larry Suffredin, County Commissioners.
PROPOSED SUBSTITUTE RESOLUTION
RESOLUTION CONCERNING BOYCOTT OF ARIZONA
AND ARIZONA-BASED BUSINESSES
WHEREAS, the State of Arizona adopted a controversial new law, SB 1070, which
makes it a state-level crime for someone to be in the country illegally and
criminalizes the failure to carry immigration documents at all times by lawful
foreign residents or otherwise hereinafter referred to as the “Arizona Immigration
Law”; and
WHEREAS, since SB 1070 was signed into law, the Arizona Legislature has
passed HB 2162, making amendments to the Arizona Immigration Law which are
an improvement, but far from ideal; and
WHEREAS, the Arizona Immigration Law imposes a requirement for police
officers to question those they suspect may be in the United States illegally when
they are lawfully in contact with such people while enforcing any other law; and
WHEREAS, the Arizona Immigration Law has been rebuked by the nation’s top
law enforcement community, which found that local police enforcement of
immigration laws would likely lead to racial profiling and have a negative effect and
undermine the level of trust and cooperation between local police and immigrant
communities; and

 FINANCE COMMITTEE REPORT
JUNE 1, 2010
PAGE 26
WHEREAS, the recent amendments to the Arizona Immigration Law try to
eliminate racial profiling by no longer allowing race, color or national origin as a
factor to be considered when forming a reasonable suspicion that a person is in
the United States illegally; and
WHEREAS, while removing race, color or national origin as a factor to be
considered is a good idea, the problem is the law now contains no guidance or
definition of what criteria should be used to form a reasonable suspicion that a
person is in the United States illegally, which can still lead to racial profiling; and
WHEREAS, the State of Arizona has charted an ominous legal course that puts
extremist politics before public safety, and betrays our most deeply-held American
values; and
WHEREAS, as it did two decades ago when the State of Arizona refused to
observe Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, the State of Arizona has again chosen to
isolate itself from the rest of the United States of America; and
WHEREAS, the most appropriate response, by the taxpayers of Cook County to
the State of Arizona, is to assure that the State of Arizona’s isolation is tangible
rather than symbolic.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Cook County Board of
Commissioners that this Board of Commissioners hereby finds the Arizona
Immigration Law to be offensive to the values of the taxpayers of Cook County;
and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that
this Board of Commissioners hereby boycotts the State of Arizona and Arizonabased businesses until the Arizona Immigration Law is repealed or invalidated;
and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that
the County will not enter into any contracts with the State of Arizona or with any
companies headquartered in the State of Arizona nor shall the County renew any
current contracts with the State of Arizona or with companies headquartered in the
State of Arizona when they expire; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that
the County will not participate in any conventions or other business which requires
County resources to be spent in the State of Arizona; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that
this Board of Commissioners hereby requests the Illinois General Assembly and
the Governor of the State of Illinois to adopt a similar resolution calling for the
boycott of the State of Arizona and Arizona-based businesses until the Arizona
Immigration Law is repealed or invalidated.

WHEREAS, as it did two decades ago when the State of Arizona refused to observe Dr. Martin

United States of America; and
WHEREAS, Flagstaff and Tucson Arizona, have filed lawsuits and other municipalities,
including Phoenix, are considering lawsuits against the State of Arizona to repeal SB 1070
(Chapter 113) that imposes an unfunded mandate to carry out the responsibilities of the federal
government; and
WHEREAS, many cities, such as San Francisco, Los Angeles, Boston, and Milwaukee are
considering or have passed legislation to ban Arizona state-based businesses; and
WHEREAS, the most appropriate response, by the taxpayers of Cook County to the State of
Arizona, is to assure that the State of Arizona’s isolation is tangible rather than symbolic; and
WHEREAS, Cook County, the 2nd largest county in the nation with a budget of over 3 billion
dollars and a diverse population of more than five million, should be a leader in protecting the
rights of people.

PRODUCTION OF THE HUMAN RESOURCE ACTIVITY REPORT. Transmitting
a Communication, dated May 14, 2010 from Joe Sova, Chief, Bureau of Human
Resources:
Comptroller Connie Kravitz and I have discussed how best to produce the Human
Resource Activity report as outlined in New Item #5 approved by the Board of
Commissioners on May 4, 2010. She and I will be conducting a meeting next
week with key members of our staffs as well as Nathan Paige of the Department
for Management of Information Systems to determine the most efficient process to
determine an accurate and timely Human Resource Activity report on an ongoing
basis.

 FINANCE COMMITTEE REPORT
JUNE 1, 2010
PAGE 29
The Comptroller currently produces a quarterly report that is sent to the Board but
the report is limited to hires and terminations. Connie and I are committed to
producing the new Human Resource Activity Report but I respectfully request an
extension of a couple weeks for us to discuss how best we can leverage current
database systems that will capture all activity for the Grades 17 thru 24 executive,
administrative, and professional employees across all of Cook County.
Secondly, I would like your perspective on whether producing the report on a less
frequent basis (as opposed to generating it within seventy-two (72) hours of a
change) would be acceptable.

PRODUCTION OF CONTRACT PAYMENTS REPORT, AND HUMAN
RESOURCE ACTIVITY REPORT. Transmitting a Communication, dated May 17,
2010 from Constance Kravitz, County Comptroller:
New Item No. 4 (Ordinance No. 10-O-23) and New Item No. 5 (Ordinance No. 10O-24) approved by the Cook County Board of Commissioners on May 4, 2010
requires the Comptroller to provide the County Board with specific information and
reports regarding contract payments and salary data in a specific time frame.
Status of Ordinance No. 10-O-23
Pursuant to Ordinance No. 10-O-23, the Cook County Comptroller is responsible
for providing to the Cook County Board of Commissioners various payment reports
within 72 hours of any payments involving an expenditure of less than $100,000
that was approved by the Purchasing Agent and of payments made pursuant to
contracts for professional and managerial services for Cook County, including the
separately Elected Officials, which involve an expenditure of less than $25,000
that were approved by the Purchasing Agent.
The Comptroller has been diligently working with the Comptroller’s Accounts
Payable Department (A/P) and the Department for Management of Information
Systems (MIS) to produce an accurate and timely payment report. While the
specific data related to contract payments is generally included in our JD Edwards
System, there is limited ability to pull a canned report such as a check registry
report. Additionally, the report that is extracted is not in a sortable format and
written duplications may occur when a Purchase Order (PO) has multiple lines.
The Office of the Comptroller has been working with MIS to create a special report
that would address such issues.
Once these reporting issues are resolved, it is projected that the Comptroller’s
Office will be able to issue such reports within the 72 hour timeframe. The Office
of the Comptroller prints checks weekly, on Thursdays and as a result, it is
anticipated that the report pursuant to Ordinance 10-O-23 would then be available
the following Monday or Tuesday.
It is anticipated that the reporting issue as it relates to Ordinance 10-O-23 will be
resolved in a timely manner; however; the parities will need additional time,
approximately a couple of weeks to derive a useful report that will meet all the
Ordinance requirements.
Status of Ordinance No. 10-O-24
Pursuant to Ordinance No. 10-O-24, the Cook County Comptroller in partnership
with the Chief of Human Resources is required to make detailed specific Human
Resource Activity Reports as outlined in the Ordinance.

 FINANCE COMMITTEE REPORT
JUNE 1, 2010
PAGE 30
I have been working with the Chief of the Bureau of Human Resources and the
Director of MIS to determine the most efficient process to determine an accurate
and timely Human Resource Activity Report. The applicable parties are meeting
to determine how each of the parties database systems capture employee
information and whether a new report should be created to address the human
resource activity information requested by the Cook County Board of
Commissioners pursuant to Ordinance No. 10-O-24.
The Office of the Comptroller will continue to work with MIS and the Bureau of
Human Resources to create a special report that would address and report the
information requested under Ordinance No. 10-O-24.
It is anticipated that the reporting issue as it relates to Ordinance 10-O-24 will be
resolved in a timely manner; however; the parities will need additional time,
approximately a couple of weeks to derive a useful report that will meet all the
Ordinance requirements.
