OF COOK COUNTY

Commissioners

 Message from the Clerk
When I ran for the Office of the Clerk of the Circuit Court of Cook County in 2000, I had a
vision of transforming the Office into a modern organizational structure and making it
accountable, technologically savvy and innovative. My vision included making the Clerk’s
Office incrementally transparent in carrying out its noble and unique duty as keeper of
court records and collector of revenues. I must humbly and realistically assert that during
the last thirteen years as the Clerk of the Circuit Court of Cook County, my vision to transform the Clerk’s
Office has come to fruition though many challenges still lie ahead. The burly and bulky docket books and
“dumb” terminals are now items of the past and have been replaced by technologically current infrastructure
and record-keeping innovations anchored by automation, imaging and document storage programs.
Despite the fact that our budget has been continually reduced, the Clerk of the Circuit Court has continued
with its record of high-level success in executing its statutory responsibilities as the keeper of records for all
judicial matters brought into one of the largest court systems in the country. Our skilled staff and line
managers have continually devoted themselves to deliver first-rate service without compromising our
hallmark and avowed commitment to efficiency. Good customer service, technological innovation, costeffectiveness as well as conscientiousness and devotion have been continually maintained in line with our
statutory and fiduciary responsibilities.
A full integration of our Imaging and Document Management System (IDMS), has allowed staff to digitize all
civil case type documents that have been submitted to the Clerk’s Office since May 23rd, 2012. Our office
has imaged more than 65.4 million court documents that may be electronically viewed on any of the Public
Access terminals at the courthouse. This latest technological breakthrough provides access to court
documents in a more time- and cost-efficient manner. The IDMS System is now in the County, Chancery,
Law, Probate, Civil, Domestic Relations, Juvenile, Child Support, and Child Protection Divisions.
e-Filing typifies one of the foremost areas where remarkable progress has been made in the Clerk’s Office.
The Illinois Supreme Court and the Administrative Office of the Illinois Courts have given the Clerk’s Office
the much-needed approval to proceed with electronic filing of all civil case types, (except condemnation)
effective March 20th, 2013. More than ever before, court users can now file their cases and respond to
litigation matters from the comfort of their homes. This remarkable progress in the Clerk’s Office promises to
offer tremendous savings in transportation costs to attorneys and pro se litigants. It will ease congestion in
our office corridors, will reduce the need for data entry, and will shorten cashiering lines.
The Clerk’s Office has embarked upon the task of replacing the existing legacy Electronic Case Management
System with a more flexible and advanced case management system. As a result, a needs analysis has
been initiated with the purpose of providing the necessary recommendations for a fully integrated electronic
case management system.
Another program that has positively impacted our operations in the Office of the Clerk of the Circuit Court is
the Electronic Traffic Ticket System (e-Ticketing) which is now in operation in 8 County municipalities and 17
are in the testing stages. The e-Ticket System transmits a traffic-stop citation from a law enforcement officer’s
squad car directly to the Clerk’s Office Case Management System. The use of the e-Ticket system has
increased speed of creating citations and making them electronically available in our Case Management

  

System. It has furthered public safety due to decreased traf?c stop time and has enhanced electronic
integration across justice agencies as well. It has also reduced data entry need.

The unveiling of our mobile app, Court Clerk Connect, and electronic notice (e-Notice) are a couple of other
programs that deserve notice. The Court Clerk Connect is an online application case information system that
gives court users access to perform searches of the case docket and traf?c tickets and obtain court-related
information using their mobile phones or their i-pad devises. This technological innovation initiated by the
Clerk?s Office stands to save court users tremendously in time and transportation costs. The Clerk?s Of?ce
also stands to incur savings as there will be fewer phones and personal inquiries requiring employees? time.

The Clerk?s Office has had a positive partnership with collection agencies and the State of Illinois in order to
enhance our revenue collections. Through September 27, 2013, the collaborative effort with the two
collection agencies has led to the collection of $31.4 million in outstanding ?nes, fees and costs since the
inception of the program in 2006. As of August 2013, the Clerk's Of?ce has collected $7.5 million in child
support fees; and $60,000 (started in August 2013) in traffic fines under the Illinois State Income Tax
Intercept Program. Since the inception of the Clerk of the Circuit Court's program in 2005, the credit card
program has processed more than $112.0 million in credit card transactions.

As FY 2014 unfolds, the Clerk?s Office seeks to continue to enhance its role of effectively, ef?ciently, ethically,
transparently and consistently serving court users in the judicial system of the First Judicial District of the
State of Illinois, in spite of reduced funding and staff. These annual staff reductions have negatively impacted
on our operations and have become almost untenable, creating backlogs, understaffing and other
inefficiencies. Nonetheless, the Clerk of the Circuit Court will strive to deliver its statutory duties in
accordance with its strategic pillars: 21St Century information Technology, Improved Customer Service,
Employee Development 8. Training, Operational Efficiency and Financial Accountability.

Dorothy Brown
Clerk of the Circuit Court of Cook County
Fiscal Year 2014 Budget Request

October 28, 2014
The Honorable President Toni Preckwinkle and
Cook County Board of Commissioners
It is my cherished privilege and honor to present the Fiscal Year 2014 budget for the
Office of the Clerk of the Circuit Court of Cook County.

I would like to take this

opportunity to share with you the maturation of our decade-long vision of the Clerk’s
Office.

In order to do this with clarity, a short statement of where we were, where we

are now, and where we are going seems to be timely and expedient.
A Historical Perspective and Vision
As you may be aware, this is my thirteenth budget presentation as Clerk of the Circuit
Court of Cook County.

When I came into office in 2000, I inherited an antiquated

technological infrastructure of “dumb” terminals, flat files in mainframe environment and
very few personal computers which had connection to the wide area network. Not only
were existing staff not able to take full advantage of the power of personal computers
and relational databases to enter, store, maintain and retrieve information, cash registers
were old, out-dated and not linked to our electronic case management system.

In

essence, the case management system in the Clerk’s Office had overwhelming reliance
on manual data. As a result, we embarked on a vision to bring about needed changes:
to guide the Office to harness technology, to examine business process-reengineering
opportunities and initiatives, to migrate from document management to content
management, to initiate customer relations management and to improve incrementally
the proper keeping of court records.
The continual budget reductions have made already limited resources in the Clerk’s
Office more challenging, necessitating cost-cutting strategies across the board, and
I 
 

 triggering reorganization of Divisions, Departments and Bureaus.

These and other

strategies have enabled the Clerk’s Office to cross-train employees and harness new
technologies in order to enable the Office to continue to perform its statutory duties.
Therefore, in spite of the budget reductions and setbacks, the Clerk’s Office, with
difficultly, continued to accomplish its goals and meet expectations of what it set out to
do during the last thirteen years.
The bulky and cumbersome docket books, and “dumb” terminals inherited in 2000 are
things of the past and have been replaced by technologically current infrastructure and
record keeping innovations anchored by automation, imaging and document storage
systems and skilled Clerk of the Circuit Court staff. Thanks to the County Board of
Commissioners, in the Clerk’s Office we now have a modern-day cashiering system, eFiling, a Mobile app, Kiosks, Intranet and an imaging system. This has enabled the
Clerk’s Office to serve our noble and unique mandates and statutory obligations as
record keeper of court records and revenue collector and disburser to all municipalities
of the County and statewide agencies.
Coming Full Cycle with Improvements
The Clerk of the Circuit Court of Cook County as official record keeper of court records
in Cook County has come full cycle in making needed and required changes in the court
system to bring it to the 21st Century model even though much work still needs to be
done. Since 2000, the Clerk’s Office has been serving citizens and participants in the
judicial system in Cook County effectively, efficiently and ethically as has been its
hallmark. During this time, it has successfully navigated through a drastic reduction in
appropriations from $98,590,841 in FY 2000 to $73,176,171 in FY 2013, a drastic
reduction of 25.8%, without a corresponding reduction in its required services. As you
are aware, the Clerk of the Circuit Court is the second largest court system in the U.S.,
and we service over 400 judges, accepting over 1.3 million new cases filed annually and
over 130 million public inquiries without sacrificing quality, efficiency or transparency in
all our undertakings.
In order for the Clerk’s Office to meet current and future changes as dictated by
budgetary reductions or fiscal challenges on the one hand, and the implementation of
new technologies and business processes on the other, it has continued to reorganize
II 
 

 and restructure itself to better inform decisions with respect to projects currently
underway or future proposals currently under consideration.

The Clerk’s Office has

continued to review its operations, reorganize and streamline its departments, bureaus
and divisions, improve management techniques with the view of enhancing cost-saving
initiatives and bringing about maximal effectiveness, proficiency, transparency,
accountability, and broadening the range of court efficiency. Consolidation of
management staff, in some areas, has made it easier to improve efficiency through the
uniform dissemination of efficient business processes. We believe this will enhance
successful and rapid transition to a virtual court house of the future.

In such an

atmosphere, video links and feeds, paperless environment and electronic documentation
with all relevant parties having access will be the prevalent feature. In this context, it is
helpful to view and analyze prospective changes in the Clerk’s Office to the system as a
series of expected waves of improvement, rather than a one-time occurrence.
FOCUS AND INITIATIVES OF THE FY 2014 BUDGET
Once again, the Clerk’s Office offers the leanest possible budget built on the progress of
the past with a budget of $74.9 million for FY 2014.

This is done without impairing the

statutory duties of the Clerk’s Office as mandated by law. In this budget, the Clerk’s
Office is holding down costs in an avowed determination to increase value without
sacrificing the established hallmarks of efficiency, accountability and transparency, while
continuing to minimize costs and effectuate revenue growth.
FY 2013 OVERVIEW
In FY 2013, the Office of the Clerk of the Circuit Court continued to initiate, improve
upon, or expand activities in the following areas:

 



Office-Wide e-Filing



Imaging and Document Management System (IDMS)



Mobile App Connect



Order of Protection Smart Forms



Case Management Needs Analysis



Website Redesign



Clerk-to-Sheriff Jail Management System (JMS) Interface
III 

 

Interactive Orders System



e-Plea



e-Notice



Electronic Tickets System (e-Tickets)

I am heartily delighted to report that in spite of limited resources in FY 2013, we
significantly and laudably accomplished our strategically planned goals and initiatives
which are among the following:
¾ Effective, Efficient, Transparent, and Proficient Accountability of Financial
Resources
The Clerk’s Office utilized available human and material resources to maximize
revenue potential, and effectuate cost reduction. The following opportunities made it
possible for the Clerk’s Office to achieve effective, efficient, transparent and
proficient operation of financial resources during FY 2013:


Debt Collection. We continued with automation of the debt placement
process through our two collection firms. As of September 27, 2013, our
two collection firms have collected $31.4 million since the inception of the
debt collection program in 2005.



Credit Card Transactions. The Clerk’s Office has continued to place a
high premium on transparency, financial accountability and maximum
efficiency in the use of appropriated funds. It has achieved a great deal
of financial success for Cook County over the past thirteen years. Since
2005, the Clerk’s Office has processed $112.04 million (through
September 27, 2013) in credit card transactions, with bail bond postings
representing $53.4 million (49.1%) of the total transactions. The e-Plea
program which started in June 2009 has since brought $23.9 million as a
result of payments on minor traffic violations online.



Remote Deposit Expansion has served the Clerk’s Office well. Through
the Remote Deposit Program, checks received from customers are
electronically scanned and deposited in the bank. The program enabled
the Clerk of the Circuit Court to reduce Armored Car service in past
IV 

 

 years.

In addition, because deposit amounts are verified by the

managers on the front end prior to depositing, we have been able to
reduce the time spent on account balancing and reconciliation.
Furthermore, funds clear the bank faster and the program has helped to
minimize the costs of re-entering deposit data into our accounting system
as remote deposit data is downloaded and transferred into our accounting
system.


FY 2013 Audit.

Our FY 2013 Audit Report indicates that the Clerk’s

Office complied in all material respects, with applicable laws and
regulations in its financial and fiscal operations. In addition, the audit
report asserts that the Clerk’s Office is maintaining effective accounting
control over revenues, expenditures, assets and liabilities. A single minor
audit finding has since been resolved.


Improved Disposition Reporting to Illinois State Police (ISP) was
funded by a grant. The grant project was completed on May 31, 2013 and
enabled us to predict potential errors and process rejected records by
either a batch run of system edits, or through research and investigation.
The application allowed corrected errors to be remitted to ISP and
updated in the State’s Criminal History Records Information System
(CHRIS). The funds were used to automate the interface of records
identified for submission before records were submitted to ISP.

¾

Revenue Growth
We remain resolved to continue to place a high premium on continued and
consistent revenue growth despite budget reductions in a troubled economy. The
high emphasis, focus and commitment on revenue enhancement has enabled
the Clerk’s Office to remit $68,449,675 to the County as of October 8, 2013
towards the FY 2013 Budgeted Revenue of $95,000,000. The Clerk’s Office will
remain firm in its dedication to continue to aggressively collect all statutory fees
and costs as well as court-ordered fines and penalties.

V 
 

 The following initiatives have played important roles and will continue to be
effective in enhancing revenue growth in the Clerk’s Office:


Enforcement Proceedings. In actions to collect fees due to the Office of
the Clerk of the Circuit Court through collection agencies, the Clerk’s
Office, through one of its collection agencies, is planning to establish
garnishment proceedings in the Civil Division that could enhance revenue
collection of delinquent fines, statutory fees and costs.



General Order for Deferment of Civil Payments. General Order 201203 signed in 2012 extends the time limit in which a pro se defendant may
defer payment of an appearance fee in Small Claims, Detainer and
Forcible Detainer cases. It authorizes the Office of the Clerk of the Circuit
Court to accept an appearance fee and defer the payment of said
appearance fee for a period of: Seven (7), fourteen (14), twenty one (21)
or thirty (30) days, provided the amount of claim does not exceed ten
thousand dollars ($10,000). This provision allows pro se defendants an
expanded opportunity to obtain funds in which to pay.

Extending the

grace period has resulted in decreased incidents of non-payment and
delinquent payment.

As of September 30, 2013, we have processed

1,181 deferred payments, totaling $217,735.


Tax Intercept Program.

The Clerk’s Office working with the Illinois

Comptroller’s Office under Local Debt Recovery Program (effective
January 1, 2012 under Public Act 97-0632) will continue to work to recoup
uncollected delinquent traffic fines.

The program allows Illinois State

Comptroller’s Office to intercept payroll checks, income tax returns,
vendor payments, pensions and lottery winnings.


e-Plea (e-Pay/e-Guilty). In FY 2009, the Clerk’s Office developed an
application that allows for the acceptance of electronic plea of guilty
online for Traffic Court Diversion tickets. This initiative deployed on June
29, 2009, has accelerated the collection of traffic payments from
individuals who opt to plead guilty and pay online rather than coming to
the courthouse. Additionally, accepting electronic guilty pleas and credit
VI 

 

 card payments via the Internet enhances disposition of court diversioneligible traffic citations, minimizes the amount of paper work collected with
the traffic citations and file storage space needed, improves operational
efficiency and lowers operational costs of collection. As of October
23, 2013, there were a total of 203,705 e-Plea transactions comprising of
71,554 guilty pleas, 113,255 traffic safety school requests and 18,896
court hearing requests. This electronic medium will enhance revenue for
the Clerk’s Office and convenience for Cook County residents and other
stakeholders in FY 2014.


Successful Expungement and Education Summit. The Clerk’s Office
successfully conducted our Ninth Annual Expungement and Education
Summit on June 8, 2013 for adults and juveniles with expungeable or
sealable felony and misdemeanor cases.

Seventy-five attorneys and

hundreds of Clerk of the Circuit Court employees volunteered to assist
individuals with expungement and sealing of their cases. Almost 1,000
customers attended the event in which 468 transactions were carried out,
completing the application for expungement of 300 cases and sealings of
168 cases.

At the Summit, the Clerk’s Office collected $14,115 in

expungement and sealing-related transaction fees. There were seven
judges hearing petitions to determine indigent eligibility and 40 exoffender service exhibitors present at the Summit.
¾ Customer Service
Improvement

in

customer

service

and

operational

efficiency

with

the

Placement of Mortgage Foreclosure Surplus Information Online.

The

implementation of several technological projects, including:


Clerk of the Circuit Court continues to collaborate with State and local
officials - the County Assessor, County Recorder of Deeds, city of
Chicago Mayor’s Office, and the Illinois State Treasurer - and formed a
Mortgage Foreclosure Surplus Fund Task Force to inform the public of
mortgage foreclosure funds held by the Clerk’s Office. The four agencies
VII 
 

 linked up with the Clerk of the Circuit Court website for collaboration and
information purposes.

In addition, the Clerk’s Office has a Mortgage

Foreclosure surplus search engine on its website and has since
September, 2013 paid out approximately $9.0 million to eligible Cook
County residents.


Continued upgrading of the technological infrastructure of the Clerk’s
Office through updating of the Clerk of the Circuit Court website with more
value-added options and features to benefit the citizens of Cook County.
The new site is bound to improve the way in which the public can
accomplish its most critical Circuit Court tasks online. It will establish web
communication as a core court business function and will provide access
to web content that is accurate, timely and easy to understand.

¾ Professional

Development.

The

Clerk’s

Office

understands

that

quality

improvement in the level of employee skills, service and productivity are important in
the successful execution of its programs, projects and services, and to this end, the
Office has invested in human capital.

The skills of employees in the Office of the

Clerk of the Circuit Court were maintained and enhanced through effective training
and development programs. Various Court employees attended several professional
development conferences, educational symposia and seminars, such as those of the
National Association for Court Management, Association for Records Managers and
Administrators, National Center for State Courts/National Court Technology
Conference, Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA), National Institute of
Governmental Purchasing, Illinois Association of Court Clerks (IACC), and National
Court Collections Conference, to name a few. In addition, the MIS Department has
recorded over 1,700 man-hours of in-house training in the areas of IDMS, e-Filing,
Cashier for Windows and basic PC skills.

¾

Clerk’s Office Reorganization for Operational Efficiency. As indicated earlier, the
Clerk’s Office has continued to ensure that office reorganization, (including
consolidation) was undertaken for purposes of cost minimization, customer service
quality improvement, and the enhancing of efficient and effective management of the
Office. This effort has involved training of managers and employees to adequately
perform various operational functions such as serving as substitute cashiers in
VIII 
 

 crunch times as well as filling in for other managers and employees across divisions
during periods of need, such as when staff shortages occur.

This effort has

continued to enhance the efficient and effective management of the Office.
¾

Enhancement of Existing Technologies and Adoption of New Ones. The Clerk’s
Office will continue to enhance existing technologies and adopt innovative ones that
can reduce costs and increase operational efficiency with the implementation of
several technological projects, including:


e-Post System. e-Post is a web-based green-technology notification
system developed in-house for use within the Clerk’s Office by senior
management staff. It reduces paper cost and increases efficiency and
productivity. It defines delegates and distributes assignment tasks for
handling incoming paper-based staff mail, and makes the communication
of these tasks more visible, searchable and accountable. The system
functions as a virtual mailroom as paper mail is scanned and assigned
electronically to recipients to “handle.” When the recipients log into the
system, they view their incoming mail assignments, receive instructions
for handling the assignment, and can report the status. The Clerk’s Office
intends to expand the use of e-Post system in FY 2014.



e-Tickets Program. Electronic Traffic Ticket System (e-Tickets), a public
safety-driven program, effectively automates the creation, capture,
transmission, and storage of a traffic-stop citation, from the squad car
directly to the Clerk’s Office electronic docket. In the initial launch phase
of this project, the Clerk’s Office partnered with four Cook County
municipalities of Bellwood, Crestwood, Matteson, and South Barrington.
Subsequently, 25 law enforcement agencies have been engaged to
participate in the program. The plan is to have the program used by all of
the 128 law enforcement agencies in Cook County.



Website Redesign. The Clerk’s Office has embarked on creating an
innovative website using cutting-edge technology. The new website will
allow for clearer and improved navigation, more text base for improved
understanding and improved search capabilities. It will establish web
IX 

 

 communication as a core court business function and will provide access
to web content that is accurate, timely and easy to understand. More
improvement is expected during FY 2014.

Testing of the system is

ongoing.
 Replacement of the Existing Legacy Electronic Case Management
System. The Clerk’s Office plans to work toward replacement of the
current Legacy Electronic Case Management System for Civil and
Criminal Areas of Law in order to improve functionality and efficiency. A
project needs analysis has been initiated.

The needs analysis will

undertake a complete examination of our current old IBM Mainframe
Legacy System and provide the necessary recommendations for a fully
integrated justice system for the operations of the Office of the Clerk of
the Circuit Court.
 e-Notice Program. The e-Notice program will allow subscribers to
receive the electronic version of notices in a secure Message Center and
the setup could allow one to request that an email notification be sent
alerting the person that an email notice has been sent. This program
went live for attorneys in August 2013 and will be available to pro se
litigants by the end of the year. .


Clerk-to-Sheriff Jail Management System (JMS) Interface. The JMS
System Interface allows the Clerk’s Office to download and test Sheriff’s
Office data for District-wide collection of real time mittimus information
from the branch and suburban locations. The system enables the sharing
of information with the Sheriff’s Office, neighboring police departments,
communication centers, and fire departments for total public-safety
interoperability. The system would allow real time seamless connection
and management of inmate population and make jail statistics available at
a glance.



Mobile App Connect. On March 11, 2013, the Clerk’s Office launched
Mobile Connect, an online application case information system. Mobile
Connect gives court users access to perform searches of the case
X 

 

 docket, traffic tickets, and obtain other court-related information from their
mobile devices such as their i-phones and i-pads. This new technological
innovation saves time and transportation costs for court users, including
pro se litigants and attorneys.



Rapid Online Access method (ROAM). The Rapid Online Access
Method (ROAM) software will allow court users the capability to search
court data across multiple databases.

FY2014 CORPORATE BUDGET
The Clerk of the Circuit Court’s FY2014 Budget Request calls for a fiscal budget of
$74,929,106 which is an increase of $1,371,622 over FY2013 Adjusted Appropriation of
$73,557,484, and $23,661,735 below the Adjusted FY 2000 Budget of $98,590,841,
which represents a (24%) reduction in our operating budget since the start of my
administration in December 2000.

Please note that in the FY2014 budget request, the

Clerk of the Circuit Court absorbed a $1,464,790 increase in salaries and wages
resulting from salary adjustments for step increases for all Clerk’s Office Corporate
employees.

Also, FY2014 turnover adjustment rate was reduced to 5.6% of Gross

Salaries ($4,181,147) from 6.2% in FY2013 ($4,605,015), resulting in a difference of
$423,868 that was absorbed by FY2014 Budget Request. Hence, the net difference of
FY2014 budget request from FY2013 Adjusted Appropriation is an actual net reduction
of $517,036 ($1,371,622 less $1,464,790 less 423,868).
FY2014 COURT AUTOMATION SPECIAL PURPOSE BUDGET
FY2014 Court Automation Special Purpose Budget Request calls for a fiscal budget of
$10,617,929 which is $1,281,653 over the FY2013 Adjusted Appropriation of
$9,336,276, representing a (13.7%) increase. Please note that reducing the turnover
adjustment rate from 26.3% (1,996,661) in FY2013 to 10.9% ($847,230) in FY2014
resulted in a difference of $650,569 which has been absorbed by FY2014 Budget
Request, as well as $153,171 salaries adjustment for step increases. Hence, FY2014
Court Automation Special Purpose Fund Budget Request is an actual net increase of
$477,913

($1,281,653

Also, it should be noted that the Clerk of the Circuit Court FY2014

Automation Fund Budget Request is $4,580,465 below FY2011 Adjusted Appropriation
of $15,198,394 which represents a three years reduction of (30.1%).
FY2014 COURT DOCUMENT STORAGE SPECIAL PURPOSE BUDGET
FY2014 Court Document Storage Special Purpose Budget Request calls for a fiscal
budget of $9,842,419 which is $432,578 over FY2013 Adjusted Appropriation of
$9,409,847, which represents a (4.6%) increase. The increase is mainly due to reducing
the turnover adjustment rate from 19.1% ($1,106,762) in FY2013 to 12.9% ($774,583) in
FY2014 which resulted in a difference of $332,179 in salary increases that were
absorbed by FY2014 budget request, as well as $117,924 in salary adjustments for step
increases. Hence, the net difference of FY2014 budget request from FY2013 Adjusted
Appropriation is an actual net reduction of $17,525 ($432,578 less 332,179 less
117,924). Please note also that the Clerk of the Circuit Court FY2014 Court Document
Storage Fund Budget Request is $6,072,981 below FY2011 Adjusted Appropriation of
$15,915,400, which represents a three years reduction of (38.2%).
FY2014 COURT ADMINISTRATIVE SPECIAL PURPOSE BUDGET
FY2014 Court Administrative Special Purpose Budget Request calls for a fiscal budget
request of $730,369 which is $98,798 over FY2013 Adjusted Appropriation of $631,571
which represents a (15.6%) increase. However, the increase is mainly due to reducing
the turnover adjustment rate from 21.2% ($110,808) in FY2013 to 7.2% ($39,680) in
FY2014, a difference of $71,128 as well as $10,764 in salary adjustments for step
increases, both amounts were absorbed by FY2014 Budget Request. Hence, the net
increase of FY2014 Budget Request over FY2013 Adjusted Appropriation is an actual
net increase of only $16,906 ($98,798 less $71,128 less $10,764). Please note that the
Clerk of the Circuit Court FY2013 Court Administrative Special Purpose Fund Budget
Request is $414,700 below FY2011 Adjusted Appropriation of $1,145,069 which
represents a reduction of (36.2%) over the last three years.

XII 
 

 FY2014 ELECTRONIC CITATION SPECIAL PURPOSE BUDGET
FY2014 Electronic Citation Special Purpose Budget Request calls for a fiscal budget of
$450,000 which is similar to FY2013 Adjusted Appropriation.
FY2014 COURT CORPORATE BUDGET EXPLANATION
The following items provide information concerning the most significant budgetary
account changes for FY2014.

Our analysis will primarily focus on the differences

between the Clerk’s Office request for FY2014 and the FY2013 Adjusted Appropriation.
Personal Services
Total Clerk’s Office’s Budget Request for Personal Services in the Public Safety
Corporate Fund for FY2014 was increased by $1,068,662 (1.5%) from $70,346,977 for
FY2013 to $71,415,639. This increase is mainly due to salary step increases.
The FY2013 Summary of Positions indicates that the Clerk’s Office has a total of 1,511.7
approved and adopted full-time equivalent (FTE) positions (1,533 actual positions).
For FY2014, the Clerk’s Office Budget Request includes 1,505.7 (FTE) positions (1,552
actual positions), a reduction of 6.0 (FTE). Please note that from FY2000 to FY2014
the Clerk of the Circuit Court reduced a total of 433.1 (FTE) positions in its Corporate
Fund over the fourteen-year period.
Due to the reduction of the Child Support Grant funds by the granting authority,
the Corporate Fund absorbed 9 positions of employees who work for Child Support that
were transferred to Corporate Fund, a total of $1,175,010 (salaries and benefits). Future
reductions by the granting authority will necessitate the re-allocation of additional Child
Support grant employees to the Corporate Budget.

The granting authority has

repeatedly indicated to us that they would no longer fund Child Support employees that
perform Clerk of the Circuit Court statutory functions.
Contractual Services
The Clerk’s Office total Contractual Services Request has been increased from
XIII 
 

 $1,730,880 in FY2013 to $2,106,018 in FY2014, a net increase of $375,138 (21.7%).
This is primarily due to $275,619 increase in Postage due to an unanticipated increase
in postage rates and an increase in certified and registered mail required by law to be
sent; $65,507 increase in Printing and Publishing is primarily due to printing additional C
& D bonds as well as I bonds that were not printed in FY2013; and, $26,300 increase in
Internal Graphics and Reproduction for printing additional needed court forms.
Supplies and Materials
The Clerk’s Office total Supplies and Materials Request has been increased from
$355,517 in FY2013 to $471,360 in FY2014, a net increase of $115,843 or (32.6%).
This is primarily due to an increase of $57,223 in Office Supplies and an increase of
$53,720 in Computer Operation Supplies.

The increase in supplies is to provide

resources for the IDMS Imaging Project.
Operations and Maintenance
The Clerk’s Office total Operations and Maintenance Request has been decreased from
$2,244,591 in FY2013 to $1,976,348 in FY2014, a net decrease of $268,243 (11.8%).
This is primarily due to $272,929 reduction in Maintenance and Repair of Data
Processing Equipment and Software.
Rental and Leasing
The Clerk’s Office total Rental and Leasing has been increased from $726,898 in FY
2013 to $828,699 in FY2014, a net increase of $101,801 (14.0%). This is primarily due
to $48,101 increase in Rental of Office Equipment and County-Wide Photocopier Lease
combined and $53,700 to accommodate an increase in Child Support rent.
Contingency and Special Purposes
The Clerk’s Office total Contingency and Special Purposes Fund has been increased
from $1,847,379 in FY2013 to $1,868,958 in FY2014, a net increase of $21,579 or
(1.2%). This is due to the additional chargeback expected from the Child Support Fund.
XIV 
 

 Major Capital Equipment - Long Term Projects
FY2014 Major Capital Equipment – Long Term Projects for Corporate Fund is $855,000
for the Electronic Record Project. Please note that due to the limited availability of
resources in Department 528 Court Automation Special Purpose Fund, the
implementation of major capital projects such as replacing the Legacy Electronic Case
Management System has been recommended by the County’s Budget Office to be
deferred until 2015.
New/Replacement Capital Equipment Request
FY2014 Clerk’s Office total New/Replacement Capital Equipment Request for Corporate
Fund was $185,860 reduced by the President’s Recommendation to $92,645 consisting
of replacing one vehicle and procurement of equipment and furniture. FY2014 Court
Automation Special Purpose Fund Request is $350,000 for Courtview software upgrade
and computer hardware infrastructure deployment and FY2014 Document Storage
Special Purpose Fund Request is $192,576 for vehicles and paper sorter equipment.

REVENUE vs. APPROPRIATIONS
It is the policy of the Clerk’s Office to maximize efficiency, increase revenue while
adopting cost-cutting initiatives that would effectuate budget reductions across the
board. I am heartened to state that between FY 2001 and FY 2013, the overall revenue
generated in the Clerk’s Office increased from $76,059,957 in FY2001 to a projection of
$95,000,000 in FY2013, an increase of 27% ($20,511,871), and the budget
appropriation declined from $87,592,581 in FY2001 to an adjusted appropriation of
$72,005,026 in FY2013, a 17.8% decline in budget appropriations.
Depicted below is a graph showing actual revenue generated in the Clerk’s Office
compared to corresponding budget appropriations between FY 2001 and FY 2013. The
graph depicts the difference between revenues generated by the Clerk’s Office and
appropriations approved by the Cook County Board between the two periods. It shows
that in spite of the economic downturn and a reduction in appropriations in the last
several years, the Clerk’s Office has continued to sustain a generally increasing trend in
revenue generation between 2001 and 2013. (The last two years have been racked by a
XV 
 

 deep recession and a slow and uncertain economic recovery). The graph also shows
that from 2001 through 2004, appropriations exceeded revenues whereas since 2005,
revenues generated in the Clerk’s Office continue to be higher than appropriations. It
shows that the Clerk of the Circuit Court has continued to meet projected goals and has
also been fulfilling its statutory objectives. Therefore, as can be inferred from the graph
below, when I took office, the revenue of the Clerk’s Office did not cover its
appropriations, but since I took office, I have aggressively pursued ways to increase the
Clerk’s Office revenue and I have been very successful.

CLOSING REMARKS
The Clerk’s Office, though negatively impacted by insufficient funds for its projects and
programs, was not short on innovation and resource management. Thanks to our skilled
staff and line managers who have continually extended themselves unflinchingly in order
XVI 
 

 to deliver first-rate service without compromising our hallmark and avowed commitment
to ef?ciency, good customer service, technological innovation, cost?effectiveness as well
as self-less service and devotion in line with our statutory and fiduciary responsibilities.

We understand that several challenges still lie ahead in fulfilling and maintaining the
vision to completely modernize the Clerk's Of?ce to meet 21St Century demands and
expectations toward a virtual court system. We must continue to innovate in order to
successfully operate a streamlined and competent Clerk's Of?ce that is committed to a
strategy that incorporates fiscal integrity, consummate internal control, transparency,
efficiency, accountability and shared optimism. I, AS WELL AS MEMBERS OF MY
STAFF, LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK CLOSELY AND
HARMONIOUSLY WITH PRESIDENT PRECKWINKLE, THE COOK COUNTY BOARD,
AND CHIEF JUDGE, TIMOTHY EVANS, IN HARNESSING THE PROGRESS WE
HAVE MADE TO DATE IN OUR CONCERTED EFFORTS TO SERVE ALL THE
CITIZENS OF COOK COUNTY AND THE USERS OF THE COURT SYSTEM
EFFECTIVELY, TRANSPARENTLY, AND EFFICIENTLY.

Res ectfully submitted,
gamut-1?

repository. The effort eliminates the need to handle court documents numerous
times. The program has been implemented in Law, Chancery, Probate, Civil,
Juvenile Justice and Domestic Relations and in 2014 will be expanded to other
areas of law and to attorneys and pro se litigants.
★ Continue preparing to consolidate all record-keeping activities into one
convenient location in Cicero, Illinois. Consolidating all record-keeping activities
will maximize operational efficiency.

Discussion of 2013 Activities and 2014 Initiatives
The Clerk’s Office continues to foster partnership in automation between Illinois
Integrated Justice Information System Implementation Board and the Cook County
Integrated Criminal Justice Information System Committee.
The Clerk of the Circuit Court continued to adapt cutting-edge technologies such as
IDMS that will enhance simultaneous filming and imaging of documents and file
accession process, thereby increasing operating and management efficiency.
The Clerk’s Office spearheaded the Standard File Room Operating Procedures
(SFROP). OnBase enables the Office to track all file locations at all times, and to
essentially eliminate or minimize the potential for file loss. Started with the Probate
Division pilot, the OnBase initiative is scheduled to be implemented in all
Department/Divisions before the end of 2013.

STAR Performance Data

activities into one convenient location in Cicero Illinois. All Records Center facilities
currently storing court records will be moved into the Cicero facility. Consolidation
of records into one convenient location will maximize the operational efficiency of
the Clerk’s Office Records Center.
