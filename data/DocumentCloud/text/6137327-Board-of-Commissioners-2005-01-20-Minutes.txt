County Commissioners
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
RESOLUTION TO INCREASE EMPLOYEE HEALTHCARE CONTRIBUTIONS
WHEREAS, Cook County employees enjoy excellent healthcare as part of their benefits package; and
WHEREAS, Cook County employees have for years received these stellar health benefits at rates far
below other governments and private industry; and

494

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JANUARY 20, 2005
WHEREAS, Cook County currently has 26,357 employees and 37,176 dependents enrolled in the
County’s health insurance program; and
WHEREAS, ever-increasing healthcare costs in conjunction with stagnant employee contributions has
had the unintended effect of increasing the already generous employee benefits package; and
WHEREAS, since 2000, the County’s cost of health benefits per employee has increased 45%; and
WHEREAS, according to the Cook County Cost Control Task Force the general practice of most
employers is to set minimal employee healthcare contributions at 20 percent of premium costs for
employees and 30 percent for dependent coverage; and
WHEREAS, Cook County employees’ average contributions are four percent for employees and two
percent for dependent coverage; and
WHEREAS, budget shortfalls have made it necessary to address the issue of increasing employee
healthcare contributions and bring them in line with other reasonable employee contribution plans; and
WHEREAS, in FY2004 all non-union employees with yearly salaries of $65,000 and above were
required to increase their monthly health insurance contributions to .7% of their salaries for single
employee coverage, 1.4% for family HMO coverage and 1.5% for family PPO coverage.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners does
hereby expand the County’s employee healthcare contributions plan to .7% for single employee coverage,
1.4% for dependent HMO coverage and 1.5% for dependent PPO coverage for all full-time employees;
and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the County Administration’s negotiation teams are hereby directed
to include the new employee healthcare contributions plan in the collective bargaining process and that
the Cook County Board of Commissioners will implement this plan immediately for non-union
employees upon passage of this Resolution.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
RESOLUTION TO MODERNIZE THE COUNTY COMPENSATION SCHEDULE
WHEREAS, Cook County employees receive annual step increases for the first five years of their
employment and step increases every two years thereafter and employees also receive annual or semiannual cost of living adjustments (COLAS); and

495

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JANUARY 20, 2005
WHEREAS, the average yearly step increase is approximately 4.5 percent and the average COLA is
approximately 3 percent; and
WHEREAS, the total annual increase of 7.5 percent is significantly higher than the national average for
the U.S. workforce of 3.5 percent; and
WHEREAS, taxes generate 44.5% of Cook County’s revenues; and
WHEREAS, Cook County’s annual step increase cost taxpayers approximately $26 million per year and
the average COLA costs taxpayers approximately $39 million per year; with the average year costing
taxpayers an additional $65 million per year for wage increases alone; and
WHEREAS, a modification of our salary system will provide job security at a time when other local
government entities have resorted to layoffs; and
WHEREAS, Cook County faces a short-term fiscal crisis in eliminating a $73 million budget gap in
FY2005 as well as a larger long-term problem: how to make Cook County government operate more cost
effectively and efficiently without resorting to new or increased taxes; and
WHEREAS, because of the lapse in current contracts, now is the time to re-structure our employee
compensation schedule for current employees as well as new hires.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the County Administration’s negotiation teams are
hereby directed to eliminate the automatic annual step increases for employees in the collective
bargaining process; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners will implement this
plan for all non-union employees immediately upon passage of this Resolution.

WHEREAS, following careful scrutiny of the proposed 2005 county budget, the Cook County Board of
Commissioners has considered the economic impact of the new tax proposal on county residents, business
owners and tourists; and
WHEREAS, for more than ten years Cook County has been negatively impacted because neighboring
counties have established riverboat casinos that have siphoned billions of would-be dollars from Cook
County coffers; and

WHEREAS, this situation poses a tremendous burden on government officials to carry out their core
missions without imposing heavy tax burdens on their citizens; and
WHEREAS, Cook County government has over the past decade held the line on property taxes and has

BOARD OF REVIEW
CONTRACTS
Transmitting a Communication from
THADDEUS MAKAREWICZ, Secretary of the Board, Board of Review
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with Catherine M. McCann,
Chicago, Illinois, for professional services.
Reason:

Catherine M. McCann has been Commissioner Berrios’ administrative assistant for the past
16 years. Ms. McCann is in charge of running Commissioner Berrios’ inner office which is
responsible for booking and logging into the computer system all the assessment changes
made by Commissioner Berrios’ staff. Last year, there were over 100,000 change entries as
well as over 100,000 no change entries. Ms. McCann has the experience to review a file and
see if the reduction was justified. Ms. McCann also plays a vital role in Commissioner
Berrios’ security checks system to verify the changed assessment value is the same value as
calculated in the assessment work-up in the file. This prevents the possibility of a mistaken
entry into the system or someone making an improper entry in the file.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $40,000.00. Contract period: December 1, 2004 through November 30, 2005.
(050-260 Account). Requisition No. 50500002.

OFFICE OF CAPITAL PLANNING AND POLICY
CAPITAL PROGRAM ITEM
Transmitting a Communication, dated January 19, 2005 from
MICHAEL E. LAMONT, Director, Office of Capital Planning and Policy
Transmitted herewith for your approval is a request for authorization to enter into a professional services
contract with U.S. Equities Development, L.L.C. for master planning services at the Stroger Hospital of
Cook County Campus. It is respectfully requested that this Honorable Body approve this request.
Reason:

The master planning services at the Stroger Hospital of Cook County Campus are necessary
in order to determine how much clinical and administrative space is necessary now and in
the future to support all the medical activities at Stroger Hospital of Cook County.
Although the new Stroger Hospital of Cook County is currently handling its patient load
well, future expansion space requirements need to be considered. The ambulatory facilities
on the campus, i.e. the Fantus Clinic, are overcrowded and have outlived their useful life.
Administrative space on the campus is inadequate and it is currently split among three
buildings on campus and one off-site leased space. Parking on campus is insufficient to
meet demand. The master planning process will determine the proper number of parking
spaces and their location.
The master planning services are the first phase in the final development of facilities at the
campus. The services by the U.S. Equities Development team will consist of the evaluation
and recommendation of the following: the economic re-use of some or all of the old main
hospital building, a replacement primary care facility for Fantus Clinic, options for added
medical/surgical beds on campus, possible expansion of the CORE Center, replacement of
administrative office capacity, expansion of campus parking capacity, freestanding
outpatient pharmacy facilities, space for medical and radiology records, space for Bureau of
Health Services research functions, feasibility of student housing and commercial/retail
development as part of the overall campus plan, and economic reuse potential of the 1900
West Polk Building, the Hektoen Building and the Durand Building.
500

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JANUARY 20, 2005

The U.S. Equities Development team is comprised of firms and individuals with a vast
amount of experience in healthcare development and some have had recent experience in
the management and design at the Stroger Hospital of Cook County Campus. The team
disciplines will include program management, architecture, planning, engineering, building
preservation, traffic/parking and cost estimating. The team has committed to providing a
preliminary report with recommendations within four to five months of the start of this
contract.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: $1,395,000.00. Bond Issue (28000 Account).
Sufficient funds remaining from the old hospital demolition contingency have been appropriated to cover
this request.

Re:

HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME Program)

respectfully request approval of a HOME Investment Partnerships Program Loan in the amount of
$1,750,000.00. The project’s sponsor is the Alden Foundation, a 501(c)(3) not for profit development
corporation. They will manage the project through their wholly owned subsidiary, Barrington Horizon,
Inc., the for-profit entity and general partner of the Barrington Horizon Limited Partnership. The
Richman Group, a tax credit syndicator, based in Greenwich, Connecticut is the project’s limited partner.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JANUARY 20, 2005
The limited partnership will be responsible for the construction of a 50 unit (42 HOME assisted units)
senior independent living development to be located at 1420 South Barrington Road, Barrington, Illinois.
In addition to the HOME loan request for $1,750,000.00, financing for the project will be provided from a
variety of sources: a Harris Bank first mortgage; an Illinois Housing Development Authority Trust Fund
loan; an Affordable Housing Program grant; and equity capital from the syndication proceeds. In addition
to those sources, the developer is deferring part of its developer fee until the project has stabilized. Total
development cost for the project is currently estimated at $8,068,872.00. The HOME loan of
$1,750,000.00 represents 22% of the total development budget at a cost of $41,667.00 per HOME unit.
The terms of the HOME Program loan will be structured as a 40-year fully amortized loan at 1% interest.
The County Home program will receive annual principal and interest payments of $53,100.00 to be used
for other HOME eligible activities.
I respectfully request approval of this project, and that the Chief Administrative Officer of the County of
Cook, or his designee, be authorized to execute on behalf of the County of Cook, any and all documents
necessary to further the project approved herein, including but not limited to the HOME Loan Agreement
and any modifications thereto. The approval of this loan by this Honorable Body will permit staff to issue

Bobbie L. Steele, County Commissioners.
I respectfully request that the submitted proposed resolution be placed on the Board Agenda
for the meeting of December 14, 2004. I further request that this item be referred to the
Committee on Zoning and Building.
The following is a synopsis of the proposed resolution.
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
DIRECTING BUILDING AND ZONING DEPARTMENT INSPECTIONS OF
CERTAIN AUTOMOBILE RECYCLING BUSINESSES OPERATING IN
UNINCORPORATED LEMONT TOWNSHIP
WHEREAS, there exist two automobile reclamation and recycling businesses, Cal Sag Auto,
Inc. and Valley Auto, in unincorporated Lemont Township proximate to the intersection of
Archer Avenue and Illinois Route 83 that have operated in this location since the 1970’s; and
WHEREAS, these businesses gained their right to operate by being granted “Special Use”
permission under the prevailing Cook County Zoning Ordinance in force at the time of their
application for operating; and
WHEREAS, on May 1, 2001, based on multiple violations issued by the Illinois
Environmental Protection Agency, a consent order was issued in Chancery Court (99 CH
9385) demanding that the owner of Cal Sag Auto, Inc. comply with an 18-point cleanup
program and to pay civil penalties; and
WHEREAS, although Cal Sag Auto, Inc. did pay civil penalties, it failed on every count to
follow the clean-up demands of the consent order; and
WHEREAS, at the request of Cook County Commissioner Elizabeth Gorman, State Senator
Christine Radogno, State Representative Eileen Lyons, and Village of Lemont President John
Piazza, on April 9, 2004, Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan filed suit against Cal Sag
Auto, Inc., asking the court to find the junkyard in contempt of the previous court order, and
other sanctions; and
WHEREAS, with the issue of IEPA violations being pursued by the Illinois Attorney
General, the issue of zoning rests squarely within Cook County’s administrative powers; and

545

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JANUARY 20, 2005
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that, because there appears to be obvious
zoning violations of the “Special Use” permits granted to the present automobile recycling
operations in unincorporated Lemont Township, the Zoning and Building Committee of the
Cook County Board directs the Building and Zoning Department to expeditiously conduct
zoning inspections of Cal Sag Auto, Inc. and Valley Auto to ensure that they fully comply
with all the terms of their “Special Use” operating status; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Commissioner of Building and Zoning report to
the Committee on Zoning and Building the findings of said inspections and the action the
Building and Zoning Department intends to pursue should zoning violations be issued.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Commissioner of the Building and Zoning
Department will provide pertinent maps, copies of the violation reports and a written status
report of the inspections and violations to this honorable committee in forty-five days.
Referred to the Zoning and Building Committee on 12/14/04.
Commissioner Donald Wlodarski, Building and Zoning Department, stated that inspectors were sent out
to survey both of the salvage yard sites. The County identified several violations on these properties. A
salvage yard inspection update will be distributed to all Commissioners. The property owners of the
salvage yard will be notified by certified mail and they will have thirty days to comply with the
violations.
Commissioner Goslin asked how much of the Forest Preserve District property the owners of the salvage
yards have encroached upon.
Mr. Wlodarski stated a quarter of an acre of Forest Preserve property has been encroached on by the
salvage yards.
Chairman Silvestri stated that the report cites six different property owners including the Forest Preserve
District which were encroached upon. The salvage yard owners were given a Special Use permit to
operate an auto salvage yard for a specific amount of acreage. They have encroached on properties of the
Forest Preserve District, Hannah Marine Corporation, Holnam, Inc. and Commonwealth Edison.
Mr. Wlodarski stated the owners of the salvage yards, Mr. Robert Bily and Mr. Jerry Chytil, have
exceeded the limit of permitted use that was granted by the Cook County Board of Commissioners
twenty-five years ago. By allowing encroachment on their properties the owners are considered to be in
violation as well as the owners of the salvage yards.
Commissioner Gorman asked about time restrictions for Special Use applications for salvage yards.
Bill Moto, Assistant State’s Attorney stated the Special Use permit was granted without time restrictions
twenty-five years ago.
Commissioner Suffredin, moved that the Building and Zoning Department notify the Forest
Preserve District regarding an encroachment upon their property by the salvage yard owners and
that, the Forest Preserve seek the property be restored to its natural state of twenty-five years ago
when the application was granted a Special Use permit. Seconded by Commissioner Goslin, the
motion carried.

546

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JANUARY 20, 2005
Commissioner Gorman asked Mr. Wlodarski to provide Chairman Silvestri with a list of pending
violations. Further Commissioner Gorman asked are the violations being sent by certified mail.
Mr. Wlodarski replied in the affirmative.
Chairman Silvestri asked Mr. Wlodarski to provide copies of the violations to the members of the
Committee.
Chairman Silvestri requested all Commissioners be co-sponsors of the resolution. Leave was
granted to add all Commissioners as co-sponsors.
Commissioner Gorman requested that the elected officials who are part of the resolution be notified about
the violations regarding the salvage yards.
Chairman Silvestri stated he would submit a letter to the local officials who are part of the resolution.
Commissioner Gorman, seconded by Commissioner Hansen, moved to approve the resolution as
amended requiring additional reports, including maps and status on the pending violations within
forty-five days. The motion carried.
