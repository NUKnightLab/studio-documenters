Report from System Chief Financial Officer
Michael Ayres, System Chief Financial Officer, presented a report on the following subjects:
• Update on Accounts Payable
Mr. Ayres stated that he had a report which suggested that as of a year ago, it took approximately eighty-five
days for an invoice to go from the System to the County to be processed. Through the consolidation of the
System’s payables function, control of the approvals and consolidation of the Finance Departments, they are
now down to fifteen days.
Chairman Carvalho asked for further information relating to the length of time it takes for the vendor to
receive payment. John Morales, Chief Financial Officer of John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County,
provided procedural information relating to the County’s expedited process with System payables, which
was implemented during his tenure as County Comptroller.

Report from System Chief Financial Officer (continued)
• Management and Tracking of Vendors
Mr. Ayres and Jeanene Johnson, System Director of Performance Improvement, provided an update on
management and tracking of vendors (Attachment #1). These efforts include the following: identifying the
initiatives, measuring the involvement of the staff, determining where they are in the work processes, and
determining if the vendors are achieving the System’s desired results. He stated that they have been working
on the development of a method to understand and control these activities very quickly and efficiently. Also
being developed is a mechanism so this information can flow upward to the different constituencies;
currently, they have developed a methodology for the higher-level reviews that lead to the grind-downs into
the heart of the project.
Director Muñoz noted that staff needs to be part of the information flow so their activities can be adjusted
accordingly; this will drive cultural change.

A. Update on MedAssets/Chamberlin Edmonds & Associates, Inc.
Director Golden, seconded by Director Muñoz, moved to recess the regular session and convene into closed
session, pursuant to the following exceptions to the Illinois Open Meetings Act: 5 ILCS 120/2(c)(1), which
permits closed meetings for consideration of “the appointment, employment, compensation, discipline,
performance, or dismissal of specific employees of the public body or legal counsel for the public body,
including hearing testimony on a complaint lodged against an employee of the public body or against legal
counsel for the public body to determine its validity,” and 5 ILCS 120/2(c)(11), regarding “litigation, when
an action against, affecting or on behalf of the particular body has been filed and is pending before a court
or administrative tribunal, or when the public body finds that an action is probable or imminent, in which
case the basis for the finding shall be recorded and entered into the minutes of the closed meeting.”
On the motion to recess the regular session and convene into closed session, a roll call was taken, the votes
of yeas and nays being as follows:
Yeas:

Chairman Carvalho and Directors Golden and Muñoz (3)

Nays:

None

Absent:

Directors O’Donnell and Ramirez (2)

THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY and the Committee convened into closed session.

Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
A. Minutes of the Finance Committee Meeting, September 29, 2009
Director Golden, seconded by Director Muñoz, moved to accept the minutes of the Finance Committee
Meeting of September 29, 2009. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

B. Presentation of Year-to-Date Financials through July 2009
Dorothy Loving, Executive Director of Finance, presented the Year-to-Date Financials through July 2009
(Attachment #2). With regard to total operating revenue, she noted that the System is $109,845,987 ahead
of budget. However, she stated that there is an unfavorable variance in patient service revenue; this is due
to the change in the daily rates that the System receives from Medicaid, the take-back of $50 million that is
affecting the inpatient hospital revenue, and the change in the calculation of intergovernmental transfer
(IGT).
Chairman Carvalho noted that the FY2009 Budget that was adopted did not anticipate the changes that were
eventually negotiated for the IGT, so a year-to-date actual to budget comparison does not provide an
accurate picture. A better measure of performance needs to be developed. Ms. Johnson stated that they are
developing key performance indicators based on volume and key statistics; this information can be
compared to financials.
With regard to the unfavorable variance in non-operating revenue, Ms. Loving noted that the biggest piece
of it comes from the sales tax. In response to a question from Chairman Carvalho, Mr. Morales provided
information on the County’s methodology for allocation of sales tax revenue.
Director Golden requested additional information on the payer mix and why the Medicaid payer mix has
changed. Ms. Loving responded that the change is due to combination of factors; examples were provided.
Chairman Carvalho stated that in the past, the Medicaid rate for the different operating units was the same.
However, going forward, the rates will be different; information provided on the different operating units
will be more meaningful as a result.
With regard to the information provided on salaries and wages, Chairman Carvalho inquired whether a
better measure or methodology could be provided. Ms. Loving responded that when the Lawson system is
up and running, it will be accrual-based and more accurate.
Additional discussion took place on the type of information that should flow to the medical staff on a
regular basis. Mr. Foley stated that he expects information that includes volumes by department and across
various service lines to be provided on a timely basis. Mr. Ayres stated that the medical staff are interested
in data on volume and payer mix, whether the System is charging and collecting for their services, and
information on their own productivity and performance. Director Muñoz added that they need information
on their budgets. Dr. Anthony Tedeschi, System Interim Chief Operating Officer, noted that the physicians
are service-line focused in terms of profitability, and stated that they are interested in information related to
nurse staffing and collections.

A. Contracts and Procurement Items (Attachment #3)
Elizabeth Melas, of the County’s Office of Capital Planning and Policy, provided information on the two
contractual requests presented.
Director Golden, seconded by Director Muñoz, moved the approval of the Contracts and Procurement
Items. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

B. Any items listed under Sections IV and V

C. Miscellaneous
• 2010 Finance Committee meeting dates
Board Chairman Batts inquired whether the Committee would need to continue to meet every other week
in 2010. After the Committee discussed the subject, it was determined that the Finance Committee
would meet once a month in 2010.
• Follow-up item
Director Golden requested that the Committee, in the near future, hold a discussion on the subject of
financial modeling for the Strategic Plan. Mr. Foley responded that there would be an item on the next
Finance Committee agenda on the subject.
VI.

Adjourn
Director Golden, seconded by Director Muñoz, moved to adjourn.
UNANIMOUSLY and the meeting adjourned.

be implemented to coincide with the implementation of
CareLink. Both currently in on hold pending CCHHS and
board approval of the proposed CareLink program
program.
Indigent healthcare plan intended to replace the Limit of
Liability program currently in use at CCHHS has been
developed and about 75% complete, however although
the proposed program was approved by the board on
8/7/2009, some of the programs requirements have now
come into question by the physicians and back under
review by the board. Implementation of outpatient
financial counseling and the CareLink program cannot
move forward until the policy is approved, changes
incorporated, policy revised, and internal and external

 Summary
The Cook County Health and Hospitals System year to date financial
results finished the eight month of the fiscal year ahead of budget by
$105,719,403. The overall revenue excess at the end of the eight month
was $94,017,091. Expenses were below budget by $11,702,313 or 1.7%.

Operating Revenue
Fees at the end of July collected from patient services were below budget
year to date by $9,208,207 or 4.7%. The number of Medicare visits is
down this year compared to the same period last year.
Other Revenue at the end of July is below the budget by $947,636 or
20.0%. Prior year revenues included one time payments which was
factored into the 2009 budget.
FMAP and NetDSH are recognized on a accrual basis to Budget.
Total Operating Revenue at the end of July was above budget year to date
by $109,845,987 or 33.5%.
Operating Expenses
Operating Expenses at the end of July were below budget by $11,702,313
or 1.7%. This favorable expense performance was due to positive
variances for Supplies, Purchased Services, and Utilities. Salaries and
Employee Benefits were under the budget year to date.

Salaries and Wages – $29,438,247 or 7.8%
Salaries and wages were below the budget at the end of July due to the
FY 2009 Budget not being approved until mid-February which resulted in
none of the new budgeted positions being recruited for.

This information is an integral part of the accompanying consolidated financial statements
Page 42 of 60

 Benefits - $4,163,540 or 7.8%
The level of Benefit expense is directly related to salary and wage
expense. Benefits for employees are below the budget because salaries
and wages are also below the budget.

Supplies – $2,500,000 or 2.3%
Each of the System facilities supply expenses are below the budget year
to date. The System is using the accrual convention to estimate supply
expense based on the budgeted expenditures minus any documented
savings to date.
In comparison to the prior year, the estimated YTD July 31, 2008 supply
expense of $90,227,518 ($59,139,146 as of YTD July ’09) was based on
actual expense taken from the Comptroller’s ledger of actual items paid
by the County. During the preparation of the prior year’s report, there
were no attempts to estimate an accrual for any missing expenses.
Purchased Services, Rental, and Other - $2,100,000 or 2.0%
The year to date level expenses for the System for this category continues
to be significantly below the budget. The method used to estimate
expense is the same for purchased services as is used for supplies.
Similar to supplies, the prior YTD July 31, 2008 estimated purchase
services, rental, and other expense amount of $79,341,043 ($51,052,748
as of YTD July ’09) was based on expenses taken from the Comptroller’s
ledgers.

Utilities - $2,966,950 or 20.9%
The estimated System year to date expense for utilities in total is below
budget. The accrual convention to estimate this expense is based on total
YTD bills, paid and unpaid, received by the Cook County Industrial
Engineer responsible for processing the utility bills for the County.
This information is an integral part of the accompanying consolidated financial statements
Page 43 of 60

 Similar to supplies, the prior YTD July 31, 2008 estimated utilities
expense of $12,313,774 ($7,825,234 as of YTD July ’09) was also taken
from the Comptroller’s ledgers.
