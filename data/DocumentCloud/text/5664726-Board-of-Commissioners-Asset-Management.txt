Sec. 2-364. Purpose.

(a) The Randolph-Sheppard Act, 20 U.S.C. Sections 107-107f shall serve as a model for minimum
standards for the operation of the Business Enterprise Program for the Blind. The federal
Randolph-Sheppard Act provides employment opportunities for individuals who are blind or visually
impaired through the Business Enterprise Program for the Blind. Under the Randolph-Sheppard Act, all
federal agencies are required to give priority to licensed blind vendors in the operation of vending facilities
on federal property. It is the intent of this Cook County Ordinance to provide the same priority to licensed
blind vendors on County property by requiring County Departments to give priority to licensed blind
vendors in the operation of vending facilities on County property and preference to licensed blind vendors
in the operation of cafeteria facilities on State property, as such the County shall:
(1) Establish, continue, maintain, and promote the opportunities for vending facilities in conjunction
with Business Enterprise Program for the Blind on all property owned or leased by the County.
(2) Provide documents detailing all current vending, office coffee, micromarket and foodservice
contracts including contracting company, location, type of service, commission structure, overall
sales and expiration date.
(3) Facilitate transitions from outside companies to the Blind Vendor and the Business Enterprise
Program on County property.
(4) Monitor vending machine income payments from outside contractors to Blind Managers or the
Business Enterprise Program for the Blind.
(5) Assure that priority is given to blind vendors in the operation of vending, micromarket, Office
Coffee Service (OCS) and lottery operations on county property owned or leased
(6) Bid preference is given the Blind Vendors in the operation of cafeterias operated with the County
property. If a tie is rendered by the County’s bid process than the counteract goes to the Blind
Vendors. The Blind Vendors may partner with contractors in the County Bid Process.
(7) No County Department may impose any commission, service charge, rent or utility charge on a
licensed Blind Vendor who operates a vending facility on Cook County property.
(8) The County shall actively pursue all commissions from vending facilities not operated by blind

Page 5 of 21

Committee Minutes

May 15, 2018

vendors as provided in this Ordinance, and shall propose new placements of vending facilities on
County property where a facility is not yet in place.
(9) A commission rate equal to commission currently paid to the County or of 20% on Net Sales
(whatever is greater) shall be paid by outside vending micro-market or Office Coffee Services
contractors to the Illinois Committee of Blind Vendors for use by the ICBV to benefit blind
vendors through the existing Blind Vendor Trust Fund.
(10) Partnerships and teaming arrangements between blind vendors and private industry, including
franchise operations, shall be allowed and encouraged by the County.
Sec. 2-365 Satisfactory Vending Facility Sites

(a) Beginning March 1, 2018, all County real estate agreements shall: With the BEPB jointly
undertake to determine whether a current or future building constructed, altered, renovated or currently
occupied by the County constitutes a suitable, satisfactory site for a Vending Facility. Any current
Vending Facility site not operated by Blind Vendors shall be considered a suitable site for a Blind Vendor.
(b) Upon receiving a request for a determination of satisfactory site, the BEPB and the Committee
shall have 20 days in which to notify that requesting County agency as to whether the new property or
building is satisfactory or not satisfactory for the operation of a blind vendor vending facility. A site shall
be deemed to be a satisfactory site by examining the potential customer base, including, but not limited to,
County employees, County contractual employees, and the general public. The determination shall be
based upon a site survey or any other reasonable means enabling an accurate assessment of the location.
If the property has an existing private vendor, bottler, or vending machine operator, then the property shall
be presumed to be a satisfactory site. If the BEPB, in consultation with the Committee, determines that
the number of people using the location is or will be insufficient to support a vending facility, then the
BEPB shall determine the property to be not satisfactory. Upon a determination by the BEPB and the
Committee that the new property or building is satisfactory for the operation of a blind vendor vending
facility, the the Director of County Real Estate shall inform the County Department to comply with the
priority established for the operation of vending facilities by blind persons under this Ordinance. All
County departments shall fully cooperate with the BEPB to ensure that priority is given to blind vendors in
the operation of vending facilities on County property. This includes notifying the Department prior to the
expiration of existing contracts or agreements for vending facilities or when such contracts or agreements
are considered for renewal options. The notification must be given no later than 6 months prior to the
potential expiration or renewal of the existing vending facility contract or agreement.
Effective date: This ordinance shall be in effect March 1, 2018...end
