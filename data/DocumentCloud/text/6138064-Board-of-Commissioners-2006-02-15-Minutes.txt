* Referred to the Finance Committee on 1/18/06.
Chainnan Daley stated that Mayor Daley had submitted a letter in support of the Ordinance, and that each
Commissioner should have received a copy of this letter. The text of the letter was entered into the
Record. (The referenced document is on file in the Office of the County Clerk.) Chaimrnn Daley then
called upon the Honorable James M. Houlihan, Cook County Assessor, for his opening statement.
Assessor Houlihan delivered the following opening presentation: The two issues addressed in this
proposed Ordinance are market and valuation. Apartment valuation is detennined by comparable sales,
income and cost. Certain sales are misleading and are not included in his Office's revenue projections.
These sales include apartments that are sold to developers who convert them into condominiums, and
industrial properties that are purchased and converted into lofts. The impact of the proposed Ordinance
upon communities would vary according to the number of apartment properties within the community.
The South Suburbs would not necessarily experience a greater impact. If savings were not passed down
to renters, there would be more income to capitalize, thereby increasing valuation and raising the tax
liability for the landowner. This Ordinance would impact both valuation and market forces, which would
affect the bottom line for landlords.
Chainnan Daley then asked the Secretary to the Board to call upon the registered public speakers.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 15, 2006
1. Honorable Edmund B. Moran, Jr. - Alderman, City of Evanston, Ward Six
Commissioner Collins inquired whether the proposed reclassification would impact the 7% cap.
Assessor Houlihan replied in the affirmative, adding that the effect would be positive.
Commissioner Collins requested clarification with regard to the time period over which the reduction
would be granted.
Assessor Houlihan replied that there would be a 2% reduction in the first year, and a 2% reduction in each
subsequent year of the triennial assessment cycle. The assessment reduction would depend upon the
market for reassessment.
Commissioner Collins voiced her concern regarding the proposed Ordinance's impact upon economic
development.
Assessor Houlihan offered to present to the Business and Economic Development Committee a thorough
review of assessment levels as they relate to business and economic development.
Commissioner Collins requested clarification regarding how this proposed Ordinance would impact
renters.
Assessor Houlihan replied that the proposed Ordinance would slow down the conversion rate of
apartments into condominiums. This would help preserve the size of the rental market. The larger the
market for apartments is, the lower the rents of apartments are.
Commissioner Quigley stated that given that the largest expense in owning a building is property tax, the
proposed Ordinance would have a significant impact upon an owner's overal l costs. Additionally, by
preserving its apartments, a community preserves its racial, age and income-level diversities. Also, the
proposed Ordinance would redress the inequities that currently exist between renters and homeowners,
such as the fact that the cost of living for renters is higher than that of homeowners, and the fact that
renters are too often forced to move out of their communities.
Commissioner Peraica stated that he would not support what he believes would essentially result in a
redistribution of taxes among income levels and which also would result in a larger tax burden upon
employers. He suggested that renters would be better served by job growth, which would allow them to
earn higher incomes, and thereby afford better housing. He advocated a single-classification tax system
which would be better understood by the public and which would reflect fair market value. He voiced
doubt regarding the trickle-down concept involved in the proposed Ordinance.
President Stroger expressed his appreciation for the work performed by the Assessor's Office. He
inquired as to how the increasing level of suburban home construction relates to the issue being addressed
in the proposed Ordinance.
Assessor Houlihan replied that he would provide detailed information on this matter to the President. He
further stated that two flats and three flats in Cook County are currently at the statutory limit of 16%, and
that the proposed Ordinance seeks to address this.
Commissioner Maldonado asked for clarification regarding how the tax savings is passed down to the
renter.

78

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDJNGS FOR FEBRUARY 15, 2006

Assessor Houlihan replied that the sale value of a rental property is a less reliable factor by which to
detennine property valuation, compared to the rental income of that property. Therefore, lower property
tax is an incentive to keep rents low. Additionally, this decrease in assessment allows apartment owners
to financially maintain their units, hence making the market more advantageous for the renter.
Commissioner Maldonado requested that Assessor Houlihan provide the Finance Committee members
with an example of how this proposed Ordinance would impact an industrial enterprise.
Assessor Houlihan agreed to provide such an example.
Commissioner Maldonado voiced hi s support for the proposed Ordinance, as it would positively impact
50% of Chicago residents and 39% of suburban Cook County residents.
Commissioner Hansen voiced his concern that the proposed Ordinance would shift tax burdens onto
homeowners and onto both commercial and industrial entities. He inquired as to how many units exist in
Classification 3 and whether the Assessor's Office possesses a list which identifies these units by owner,
as distinct from trusts.
Assessor Houlihan replied that the Assessors Office does possess such a list.
Commissioner Hansen voiced his doubt, given the lack of presented evidence that the benefits of the
lowered assessments would be passed on to the renters. He stated that the real issue is the inscrutable
Cook County property tax code.
Assessor Houlihan alluded to a Chicago Tribune article which asserted that apartment rent and utilities
are currently lower than they were two years ago. He suggested that this reflects that the last assessment
break achieved its intended effect.
Commissioner Claypool introduced an amendment to Section 11 to provide for a sunset provision to the
proposed Ordinance. Commissioner Claypool presented the following reasons why a sunset clause
should be included in the proposed Ordinance: l) as a result of rising interest rates or other economic
factors the proposed Ordinance might no longer be necessary; 2) landlords might not lower rents; 3) the
impact on other classifications might not be as small as predicted. He specified that this clause should be
in place for the three-year triennial to be consistent with the other assessment practices.
President Stroger inquired whether the proposed Amendment, if passed, would effect this year's
assessments.
Assessor Houlihan responded in the negative.
Commissioner Claypool clarified that, per the Amendment, the sunset provision would be reviewed by
the Board at the end of the next triennial reassessment.
Commissioner Suffredin stated that the proposed Amendment mirrors how the Illinois General Assembly
included a three-year sunset clause in its 7% law, in order to cover the entire review of each of the triads
in Cook County. The proposed Amendment would ensure that every part of Cook County would be
treated equally. It is unfair that rental building owners are assessed at a higher rate than homeowners.
The spreading of the tax burden is reasonable; it helps Cook County approach a better equal protection
argument. The largest challenge facing the tax system is the state equalizer, which is at 2.5 and above,
too high in relation to assessments.

79

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDTNGS FOR FEBRUARY 15, 2006

President Stroger stated that Cook County needs to work more closely with the Illinois General Assembly
in the matter of tax reform.
Commissioner Collins voiced her opposition to the funding of schools through property tax, and noted
that on this issue there is much work to be done in conjunction with the Illinois General Assembly.
Assessor Houlihan stated that he would be willing to submit, in three years, a report to the Board
regarding the impact of the proposed Ordinance in each reassessment cycle, the benefits accrued, and how
it has affected the base and the shift. He also stated that he would continue his work in Springfield to
change the way schools are funded.

Commissioner Claypool, seconded by Commissioner Suffredin, moved to amend Section 11 by
deleting the following: "The 2005 amendment to the Real Property Classification Ordinance
concerning Class 3 shall be effective for the 2006 assessment year and subsequent years." and
inserting in lieu thereof: "The 2005 amendment to the Real Property Classification Ordinance
concerning Class 3 shall be effective for the 2006, 2007, and 2008 assessment years. This Ordinance
shall sunset in 2008, with the option to reinstate per the approval of the Board of Commissioners of
Cook County, for the subsequent assessment years." Commissioner Peraica called for a Roll Call,
the vote of yeas and nays being as follows:
ROLL CALL ON MOTION TO AMEND SECTION 11
Yeas:

Commissioners Claypool, Collins, Chainnan Daley, Commissioners Moreno, Quigley,
Suffredin and President Stroger (7)

Nays:

Commissioners Gonnan, Hansen, Maldonado, Murphy, Peraica, Silvestri and Vice
Chairman Steele (7)

Absent:

Commissioners Butler, Goslin and Sims (3)

The motion to amend Section 11 FAILED.
Commissioner Murphy voiced concern that the proposed Ordinance might negatively impact Class 9
economic incentives in her district.
Assessor Houlihan replied that the proposed Ordinance would not negatively impact the Class 9
incentives in Commi ssioner Murphy's district. He committed to holding meetings with and providing
additional data to all advocacy groups regarding any possible negative impact upon the Southland. He
expects the Southland Chamber of Commerce to approve of the proposed Ordinance. The Southland
Chamber of Commerce takes serious issue with the extent to which school funding relies on property
taxes. At the beginning of his term in office he attempted to solicit, to no avail, suggestions regarding this
matter from the following members of the business community: the Southland Chamber of Commerce,
retail merchants, the Manufacturing Association and local chambers. The Chamber of Commerce and the
business community have grave concerns regarding what they believe is an over-reliance on property
taxes on businesses. He has made suggestions regarding the following: broadening the sales tax base;
raising income tax as well as the exemption level to more equitably fund the School System ; and
examining gross receipts in order to create a business tax that would be lower and broader. He believes
that any opposition to the proposed Ordinance from the business community would not be based on the
merits of the proposed Ordinance. Rather, this opposition would result from the business community's
strongly held belief that the burden of taxes on businesses is too extreme.

80

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 15, 2006

Commissioner Murphy stated that she had recently attended a meeting of the Southwest Suburban
Mayors and Managers Association and was involved in a task force to examine funding sources, other
than property taxes, for public education. She recently learned that Illinois ranks 38th nationally in tenns
of homeownership. She stated that this is a matter for serious concern.
Commissioner Moreno stated that the Commissioners should collectively meet with the Illinois
Legislature to discuss tax issues. A vacant building is more likely to be converted into housing and put
on the market if its taxes are lowered. Infonnation concerning the allocation of taxes among government
entities needs to be made more available to the public. Some people are entering the homeowner's
market unadvisedly because of the increasing cost of rent; these people often contract for mortgages with
exorbitant insurance rates and later go bankrupt. He approves of the proposed Ordinance because he
believes it is part of a larger plan to alleviate the financial burdens of the County's poor.
Vice Chairman Steele voiced her disappointment that the Assessor did not provide two charts: One that
would show how renters and owners would benefit from the proposed Ordinance, and one that would
show who would absorb the tax shift.
Assessor Houlihan offered to meet with Commissioner Steele to provide data and answer questions before
the matter goes before the Board. However, if the proposed Ordinance is not reported out from the
Committee to the full Board, then it will not be possible to implement the changes in time for the City of
Chicago reassessment. The measure was introduced in October.
Commissioner Gonnan stated that she agrees with the objective of helping to provide affordable housing,
but she does not believe that the proposed Ordinance is the best way to achieve this. Cook County is
neither builder-friendly, nor tax-friendly. This reduction cannot be monitored. Slumlords will not pass
the savings onto their renters. Business incentives would be more effective.

Commissioner Suffredin, seconded by Commissioner Murphy, moved that the Ordinance
(Communication No. 275135) be approved and adopted. Commissioner Peraica called for a Roll
Call, the vote of yeas and nays being as follows:

aHd December 14, 2004, and February 15, 2006) is hereby amended to read as follows:
The Cook County Board of Commissioners finds and declares:
(1)

that in certain areas of Cook County there is a lack of viable industrial and commercial buildings,
which is contributing to substantial unemployment in such areas;

(2)

that if existing industrial and commercial structures were improved and utilized fully, and if new
industrial and commercial structures were developed, the County's economic well-being would be
improved by an increase in the level of economic activity, by increased employment opportunities
and by a growth in the real property tax base;

(3)

that because of the blighted or depressed condition of the areas where such development is
neededi the ordinary unaided operation of private enterprise cannot accomplish the necessary
modernization, rehabilitation and development, therefore provision must be made for public
assistance and encouragement of such private enterprises;

(4)

that the creation of new property tax classifications for (a) new development of industrial
structures, or the substantial rehabilitation and re-utilization of existing industrial structures, for
the County as a whole as well as for specific areas of special need, and (b) new development of
commercial structures, or the substantial rehabilitation and re-utilization of existing commercial
structures in areas that are depressed, blighted or threatened with blight, is an appropriate and
necessary method of providing such assistance and encouragement, and will result in increasing
the tax base in such areas and for the entire County; and

(5)

that the creation of a new property tax classification for the rehabilitation and new construction of
certain multifamily rental housing will increase and improve the stock of decent, safe and
affordable housing for low- and moderate-income households in Cook County, and will remove
the blight or potential blight of deteriorating housing stock while also increasing the tax base of
the County.

(6)

that the amendment of real estate assessment classifications for the purpose of lowering the
assessment level for certain retention and development of the most affordable pennanent housing
available to homeless and very low income individuals.

(7)

that the creation of a new property tax classification, to faci litate commercial and industrial
development through remediation of property, contamination of which is not attributable to the
owner, is an appropriate and necessary method of providing assistance and encouragement to
achieve remediation and utilization of such property, which will result in increasing employment
opportunities as well as the tax base in the areas in which such sites are located and in the entire
County.

(8)

that the Class L tax classification, will encourage the preservation and rehabilitation of
historically and architecturally significant buildings, will enhance the general character of real
estate in the County and contribute to the economic well-being of the County by increasing the

82

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 15, 2006

level of economic activity, increasing employment opportunities and contributing to the longtenn growth of the real property tax base.
(9)

that the creation reduction of a nev,• flFeflerty tax classification to the assessment level for Class 3
properties will encourage the preservation and retention of existing affordable rental housing
units which is necessary and beneficial to the population of Cook County.

evidence that the real estate currently complies with all applicable local building, safety
and health requirements and codes and (3) the Assessor determines that all application
qualifications, except the major rehabilitation or new construction requirement, were
maintained during the incentive period.
When the Class 9 classification is due to expire or is tenninated by action of the owner or
the Assessor, the property owner shall, in a manner and fonn detennined by the Assessor,
notify all Class 9 tenants of the date of the termination of Class 9 classification. Once the
Class 9 classification is terminated, the real estate shall revert to the applicable
classification under this Ordinance.
Class S:
Real estate otherwise entitled to Class 3 classification under this ordinance, consisting of
land and existing buildings and structures, which is subject to a Section 8 contract that has bee n
renewed under the " Mark Up To Market" option, as defined herein. The portion of the land and
building eligible for the incentive shall be in such proportion as the number of Section 8 units bears to
the total number of units. Said proportion shall be applied only to property used for residential
purposes, and not to portions of the property, if any, used for commercial purposes.
Property qualifies for the Class S classification if its Section 8 contract has been renewed
under the Mark Up To Market option, pursuant to one of the following alternatives:
I. HUD has approved renewal of the Section 8 contract under the Mark Up to Market
option, after finding that:

2.

A.

The property has received a physical inspection score of at least 60, in an
inspection by HUD's Real Estate Assessment Center, confirming that the
property is decent, safe, sanitary and in good repair with no uncorrected
Exigent Health and Safety (EHS) violations; and

B.

The property does not have a low-and-moderate-income use restriction that
cannot be eliminated by unilateral action by the owner. If, however, the
current rent is lower than the use restriction, HUD may use the Mark Up To
Market option to increase the rents to the use restriction level, which would
be a renewal qualifyi ng for the S classification; and

C.

A Rent Comparability Study conducted by HUD has demonstrated that
comparable market rents are above I 00% of the HUD Fair Market Rent.

HUD has approved a contract renewal for 5 years of the Section 8 contract under its
discretionary authority relating to the Mark Up To Market option, after finding that
the property meets at least one of the required criteria:

99

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDfNGS FOR FEBRUARY 15, 2006

A.

A vulnerable population is affected, or

B.

There is a low vacancy rate in the area, which would make tenant based
assistance difficult to use, or a lack of comparable housing, or

C.

The project is a high priority for the local community, as demonstrated by a
contribution of State or local funds to the property.

Additional requirements for qualification for the S classification are:
I. At least 20% of the living units must be Section 8 units for qualifying low and
moderate-income persons.
2.

The owner(s) must agree to retain at least the existing number of Section 8 units for
at least 5 years after the expiration of the expiring or expired Section 8 contract.

3.

For the duration of the Class S classification period, applicant must file annually with
the Assessor, on or before a date determined by the Assessor, a sworn statement
verifying continuous compliance with the Class S provisions of this Ordinance.

4.

Applicant must agree to notify the Assessor's Office if the Section 8 contract is
tenninated prior to its expiration date. Applicant shall provide to the Assessor's
office a copy of any Notice of Default or Notice of Abatement received from HUD.

When the applicant applies to HUD for a contract renewal under the Mark Up To Market
option, no less than 120 days prior to the expiration of the contract, the applicant shall
notify the Assessor's Office of the application, on a fonn provided by that office. Upon
receiving approval of the contract renewal from HUD, the applicant shall file an
application for the incentive with the Assessor's Office, on a form provided by that
office. The application shall be supported by a copy of HUD's letter approving the
contract renewal and a copy of the executed renewal contract.
Any property which, as of the effective date of this Amendment to the Classification
Ordinance, has an existing Section 8 contract with a Mark Up To Market option may
apply for Class S classification for the any portion of the 200 I assessment year
encompassed within the contract term, and for the remainder of the contract term,
including any renewals approved with the Mark Up To Market option.
The classification shall continue until the expiration or tennination of the Section 8
contract.
The incentive may be renewed if the Section 8 contract is again renewed under the " Mark
Up To Market" option. Upon filing an application with HUD, no less than 120 days prior
to tennination of the contract, for renewal of the Section 8 contract under the Mark Up
To Market option, the taxpayer shall provide notice to the Assessor's Office of its
application for renewal. The taxpayer shall provide a copy to the Assessor's Office of
HU D's approval of the contract renewal, or notification of other action.
The Assessor's Office s hall adopt rules consistent with the foregoing necessary to ensure
proper review of all factors relevant to detennine initial and continued eligibility for the
benefits provided under Class S.

Class L:

Real estate which:

( I) is designated as a Class 3, Class 4, C lass Sa or Class Sb pursuant to this Ordinance;
and
(2) is a Landmark or Contributing Building as defined in this Ordinance; and

(3) has undergone Substantial Rehabilitation, as defined in this Ordinance. The
Substantial Rehabilitation must constitutes an investment by the owner of at least
SO% of the building's full market value as determined by the Assessor in the
assessment year prior to the commencement of the Substantial Rehabilitati on.
Generally, the incentive shall apply only to the building and wi ll not apply to the land
underneath the building. However, if the entire building has been vacant and unused for
at least 24 continuo us months prior to the filing of the eligibili ty application with the
Assessor, the land upon which the building is situated shall · also be eligible for the
incentive.
Prior to filing a C lass L e ligibility applicati on with the Assessor, an applicant must obtain
an ordinance or resolution from the unit of local government in which the real estate is
located, which expressly states that the local government:

( 1) has detennined that the incentive provided by Class L 1s necessary for the
Substantial Rehabilitation of the property; and
(2) supports and consents to the granting of the incentive; and
(3) has reviewed and accepted its Preservation Commission's written
recommendation of the project for the Class L incentive. T his recommendation
will specify the project's budget and the proposed scope of work and will specify
that the project will meet or exceed the Standards of the United States
Department of the Interior for Rehabilitation, Preservation, Restorati on, and
Reconstruction of historic properties.
A certified copy of the ordinance or resolution need not be fi led with the Assessor at the
time the Class L eligibi lity applicati on, is filed but the ordinance or resolution must be
filed with the Assessor no later than the date an assessm ent appeal is filed to request the
class change to C lass L.
If the ordinance or resolution is not fi led at the time the eligibility application is filed, the
applicant shall instead, include the following items with the eligibility application:
( I) a letter fro m the municipality or the County, as the case may be, confinning that
a resolution or ordinance supporting the incentive has been requested~ and

(2) a copy of the Preservation Commission's recommendation of the project.
A copy of the resolution or letter confinning that a resolution has been requested,
whichever is filed with the application, will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the

IOI

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 15, 2006

Secretary of the Cook County Board for distribution to the Commissioners from the
affected districts.
Additionally, to qualify a Landmark building or Contributing Building for Class L
classification, an eligibility application must be made to the Assessor within one year
prior to the commencement of Substantial Rehabilitation.
After the Substantial
Rehabilitation has been completed, the Preservation Commission shall review the project
to determine that it is eligible hereunder. The applicant must supplement the eligibility
application with a copy of the detennination of the Preservation Commission prior to
classification of the real estate as Class L.
The initial Class L classification shall continue for a period of twelve years from the date
such Substantial Rehabilitation was completed and initially assessed.
For property which was initially classified as Class 3, 4 or Sb, this incentive may be
renewed during the last year a property is entitled to a 16% assessment level, if the
following requirements are met:
I.

the taxpayer notifies the Assessor's Office of his intent to request renewal of the
incentive from the municipality, or the Board of Commissioners of Cook County
if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, and;

2. the municipality in which the real estate is located or the Board of
Commissioners of Cook County, if the real estate is located in an unincorporated
area, adopts a resoluti on expressly stating that the municipality or County Board,
as the case may be, has detennined that the use of the property is necessary and
beneficial to the local economy, and supports and consents to renewal of the
Class L, and
3. a copy of that resolution and a completed renewal application are filed with the
Office of the Assessor before the expiration of the incentive period.
The number of renewal periods is not limited as long as the property continues to apply
and qualify for Class L. The notice of intent to request renewal which is filed with the
Assessor's Office wi ll be fo rwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the Cook
County Board for distribution to Commissioners from the e~ffected districts.
If, as of this Ordinance's effective date, a property is receiving Class L treatment, but the
assessment level is higher than 16%, that taxpayer may apply for renewal as outlined
above and receive a 16% assessment level for the prescribed period beginning after the
filing and approval of the resolution and renewal application. However, if as of the
effective date, the tax payer's assessment is higher than 16% and the taxpayer is granted a
renewal of the incentive for subsequent years, no reduction of the current assessment
level based on renewal of the incentive will be granted. If no renewal is obtained, the
incentive shall be phased out over the next two years, pursuant to Section 3 below. After
expiration of the last incentive period, the real estate shall revert to the applicable
classification under this Ordinance.
For commercial properties, once the original twelve year incentive period has expired, the
commercial Class L incentive will expire. The incentive classification will not be subject

102

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 1S, 2006

to renewal and the real estate shall revert to the applicable classification under this
Ordinance.
The Assessor shall adopt rules consistent with the foregoing necessary to ensure proper
review of all factors relevant to determine initial and continued eligibility for the benefits
provided under Class L.
The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports by all
Class L recipients as to the continued Landmark status of the property and the number of
persons employed at the Class L site. Failure to file such reports within the time
established by the Assessor's rules may result in loss of the incentive for the period
relating to the non-filing.

Section 4.
(A)

To qualify as a commercial development project under Class 7a or 7b, it is necessary that the
project be located in an area in need of commercial development in that:
(I)

the area is, or has been within the last 10 years, designated by federal, state or local
agency as a conservation, blighted or renewal area or an area encompassing a
rehabilitation or redevelopment plan or project adopted under the Illinois Urban Renewal
Consolidation Act of 1961, as amended, or the Commercial Renewal Re-development
Areas Act of 1967, as amended, or that the area is located in a federa l Empowennent
Zone or Enterprise Community, as proposed and approved by the Cook County Board of
Commissioners on June 22, 1994 or the Chicago City Council on May 18, 1994, or the
Commercial District Development Commission Ordinance of the City of Chicago or
designation(s) of like effect adopted under any similar statute or ordinance; and

(2)

real estate taxes within said area, during the last six years, have declined, remained
stagnant or potential real estate taxes are not being full y realized due to the depressed
condition of the area; and

(3)

there is a reasonable expectation that the development, re-development or rehabilitation
of the commercial development project is viable and likely to go forward on a reasonably
timely basis if granted Class 7a or 7b designation and will therefore result in the
economic enhancement of the area; and

(4)

certification of the commercial development project for Class 7a or 7b designation will
materially assist development, re-development or rehabilitation of the area and the
commercial development project would not go forward without the full incentive offered
under Class 7a or 7b; and

(5)

certification of the commercial development project for Class 7a or 7b designation is
reasonably expected to ultimately result in an increase in real property tax revenue and
employment opportunities within the area.

Prior to filing a Class 7a or 7b eligibi lity application with the Assessor, an applicant must obtain
from the municipality in which the real estate is located, or the Board of Commissioners of Cook
County if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, an ordinance or resolution expressly
stating that the municipality or County Board, as the case may be, has determined that factors ( I )
through (5) are present and that the municipality or County Board, as the case may be, supports
and consents to the Class 7a or 7b application to the Assessor. A certified copy of such ordinance
or resolution shall be included with the Class 7a or 7b application at the time of filing the
application with the Assessor. A copy of the ordinance or resolution, whichever is submitted,
will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the secretary of the Board of Comm issioners for

104

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 15, 2006

distribution to the Commissioners from the affected districts. The application shall include any
other information deemed necessary by the Assessor. The applicant must demonstrate that the
commercial development project qualifies for the Class 7a or 7b classification and shall bear the
expense of doing so.
Inasmuch as the County desires to encourage economic development in the neighborhoods of
Cook County, support the increased use of the incentive by smaller projects and to limit the
expense of such applications, the Assessor shall liberally construe the requirements of factors (I)
through (5) for Class 7a applications.
The Assessor shall adopt rules, including a provision to ensure a proper review of the application
and supporting data.
Certification of a commercial development project shall not be denied by reason of insufficient
size if it otherwise qualifies hereunder. In detennining what constitutes the "full incentive
offered" as provided in factor (4) above, consideration may be given to any lawful intergovernmental participation agreements under which the project developer has agreed, as a
precondition to C lass 7a or 7b certification, to share a portion of future profits with the
appropriate taxing districts.
For Class 7a applications, where the Assessor finds that factors (I) through (5) exist, he shall,
within 60 days after receipt of the application and necessary supporting data, certify the
commercial development project eligible for Class 7a treatment under this Ordinance.
In order to detennine Class 7b applications, upon receipt of the application and all the necessary
supporting data, the Assessor shall forward it to the Economic Development Advisory Committee
of Cook County. The Committee shall within thirty days return the application to the Assessor
with a finding stating whether factors (I) through (5) are present. Upon receipt of a written
request from the Committee no later than seven days prior to the expiration of the thirty day
period, the Assessor may extend for a period not to exceed an additional thirty days the time for
return of the application with the Committee's finding. The Assessor shall review the application,
supporting data, findings of the Committee and other appropriate facts. Where the Assessor finds
factors ( I) through (5) exist, he shall, within 30 days of the rece ipt of the Committee's findings,
certify the commercial development project eligible for Class 7b treatment under this Ordinance.
Class 7a and 7b certifications shall lapse within one year from the date of issuance unless new
construction or substantial rehabilitation, or in the case of abandoned property, reoccupation of
the commercial development project has commenced prior to its expiration.
(B)

To be certified as an area in need of substantial revitalization for purposes of Class 8
classification it is necessary: (I) that the municipality in which the area is located or, if an
unincorporated area, the County detennine by lawful resolution that the area is in a state of
economic depression and that it is not economically feasible for private enterprise to accomplish
the necessary modernization, rehabilitation, and development of the area without public
assistance and encouragement, or a detennination of similar import; (2) that the municipality or,
if in an unincorporated area, the County apply to the Assessor for certification of the area as one
in need of substantial_revitalization; (3) that, upon receiving an application to certify an area as in
need of substantial revitalization, the Assessor shall review the application, supporting data and
other appropriate factors relevant to a determination of the severity of the economic conditions of
the area. [n determining whether the "in need of substantial revitalization" requirement is met,
the Assessor shall give strong consideration and substantial weight to the fact that an area is

105

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 15, 2006

located in a federal Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community, as proposed and approved by
the Cook County Board of Commissioners on June 22, 1994 or the Chicago City Council on May
18, 1994.
Upon finding that existing factors convincingly demonstrate that the area is in need of substantial
revitalization, as defined in this Ordinance, the Assessor shall grant such certification to the area.
In making this determination statistical data relevant to the surrounding area as well as the
specific area for which certification is sought may be considered. The surrounding area for the
City of Chicago shall be the "community area" as defined herein; for all other areas in the County
it shall be, where applicable, the municipality in which the area is located.

If a municipality within an Enterprise Community, as proposed and approved by the Cook
County Board of Commissioners on June 22, 1994, or the Chicago City Council on May 18,
1994, detem1ines by municipal resolution that the area is in a state of economic depression and
that it is not economically feasible for private enterprise to accomplish the necessary
modernization, rehabilitation, and development of the area without public assistance and
encouragement, or a determination of similar import and submits a request for Class 8
certification, such certification shall be automatic pursuant to this ordinance. However, each
property eligible for a Class 8 incentive within the certified area must file their application in a
timely manner.
(C)

"Effective January 1, 200 1, any Class 6a incentive that is still active can be renewed. The Class
6a incentive is defined in the Cook County Real Property Classification Ordinance adopted and
approved on March 16, 1992. The renewal procedures described in Section 2 of this amendment

paragraph shall be held unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, the decision of such court
shall not affect or impair any of the remaining provisions.

thereto, and all rules promulgated by the Assessor hereunder, shall be submitted by the Cook County
Assessor to the President and Board of Cook County Commissioners annually on or before December 1.

Section 8.

C, Class 7a, Class 7b and Class 8 shall expire on December 31, 2009, unless otherwise reviewed by
action of the Cook County Board of Commissioners. Real estate granted a Class 6, Class 6a, Class 6b,
