In the matter of Anthony G. Ciaravino; Pursuant to 40 ILCS 5/5-214 and 40 ILCS 5/5-214.2 and for all the

period October 17, 1994, through July 2, 1997, at which time he was employed as an investigator with the
City of Chicago Budget Office, as the statutory provisions of the Act do not grant police pension service
credit for such service. Ciaravino's request for police pension service credit for all or part of the time period

last week the short list book for two Requests for Proposal Searches (RFPs). The reason for the accelerated
time frame on these searches was discussed, noting the pending retirement of President Hauser. Given the
timing of distribution of the short list books, the Trustees requested extra time to review the long list, as well
as the recommendations for a short list. Further discussion was then held on the RFP respondents.
Ms. Devitt requested splitting the finalist presentations for the two searches over two days, one day for CorePlus and one for Value-Add Real Estate.

Recognition to Trustee Beyna, who has spent a significant amount of time, on the collection of
proceeds from Evidence and Recovered Property from the Chicago Police Department. Trustee Beyna
secured $840,000, which will be deposited into the Gift Reserve. A brief discussion was then held
regarding the legal parameters of spending from such Reserve.
A draft of a revised disabled child’s application was distributed to Board members for review and
comment, noting the Board directed staff to begin utilization of such new application.
The next item the Executive Director discussed was amending the Fund’s staff employee handbook to
reflect that an employee of the Fund, if he or she received an approved disability award through the
Laborer’s Pension Fund, would be able to continue participation in the healthcare plan provided to
Fund staff and such participation would be allowed at the employee rate during the duration of his/her
disability.

Fund’s employee handbook to reflect this change.

The Executive Director informed the Board members that Mr. Jack Burns, with Source One, had
requested demographic data on the Non-Medicare retirees participating in the Non-Medicare Blue
Cross/Blue Shield plan sponsored by the City of Chicago, so that an alternative insurance provider,
Aetna, could be solicited to provide an alternative coverage option. Mr. Burns requested information
such as dates of birth, gender, zip code, etc. The Board indicated that only member participation
counts for annuitants over age 65 and under 65 selecting Non-Medicare coverage was to be provided.
The next item for review and discussion was the Member Benefit Annual Statements. Drafts of the
proposed statement were provided to the Board, which contain the changes which shall reduce
actuarial costs in the future. Future statements will only provide total contributions the member has
paid into this Fund. Executive Director Tuczak received the Board’s approval on the revision of
Member Benefit Annual Statements, noting that a message in red will be included indicating that
certain information will no longer be provided in subsequent years.
Officer Richard R. Mint is currently in receipt of duty disability benefits and resides in Florida. He
was scheduled for a Functional Capacity Evaluation (FCE) in Chicago. Officer Mint requested an
accommodation to have the FCE completed in Florida. Despite documentation between the officer
and the Fund’s attorney, Officer Mint scheduled the FCE in Florida at his cost. Dr. Orris reviewed
the test results noting that specific tests performed by the Fund’s providers were not completed. After
discussion it as agreed that the Board would seek additional information from the Florida facility that
performed the FCE. This matter will be revisited.

In the matter of Michael V. Saladino, the Board requested that his benefit be suspended
October 1, 2018, if he failed to schedule and complete a Functional Capacity Evaluation (FCE) during
the month of October 2018. Based upon the advice of Board counsel, the communication and
suspension of benefits on this matter was deferred one month to November 2018. The Board agreed
and further communication regarding the Board’s decision with be sent to Michael Saladino.

Board President Kenneth Hauser’s retirement on November 29, 2018.

party honoring President Hauser, inviting current trustees, former trustees and Fund staff.

The next item was an update on the meeting with the City of Chicago Budget Director regarding 2016
and 2017 tax receipts. Executive Director Tuczak turned this topic over to the Board Counsel, noting
Fund attendees included Director Tuczak, and Fund counsel David Kugler and Justin Kugler. Justin
Kugler summarized the meeting with the representatives from the City and the Fund’s interpretation
of the tax levy requirements in the Pension Statutes. Based upon the wording in the Statutes, the
Fund should be certifying the unpaid amounts by the City with the State Comptroller, despite the
City’s position regarding the loss in collections of the tax levy. Also at issue is whether the Fund
shall intervene into the case brought by the Firemen’s Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago against
the City regarding the uncollected tax levies. It was also noted that Fund staff is currently working
with the City to ascertain and reconcile the uncollected amounts. After a lengthy discussion, it was
moved by Trustee Wright, seconded by Trustee Wodnicki that the Fund file for certification on the
uncollected 2016 and 2017 payments from the City.

to sworn limited duty, including utilization of a service revolver, quantity of shots within target, and
other accommodations. State regulation of qualification was also noted. Last, Dr. Orris reported
that the CPD will be obtaining a new weapon which may be somewhat easier to handle with respect
to hand pressure required to shoot.
