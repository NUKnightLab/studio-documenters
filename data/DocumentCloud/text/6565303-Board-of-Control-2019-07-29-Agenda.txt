Department of Human Resources, recommending an award on RQ45827 and enter into a sole source
contract with The Jellyvision Lab, Inc. in the amount not-to-exceed $132,972.00 for ALEX virtual benefits
counselor software subscription services for Cuyahoga County Employee Benefits Open Enrollment for
the period 7/22/2019 – 10/7/2020.
Funding Source: Benefits Administration
Holly Woods, Department of Human Resources, presented. Dale Miller asked if the next Open Enrollment
is ready for implementation and asked how individual users of this software could feel confident that they
are being directed to the best plan rather than the plan that is more advantageous to the County; and
asked what the difference between the Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) and Exclusive Provider
Organization (EPO) Plans are.
Joseph Nanni asked who determines what type of data goes into the system, which is the core component
of the software, as it is relative to the recommended plan offered to the employee, which could potentially
favor the County’s interests; asked if County costs are analyzed when recommending a plan; asked if the
recommendation is based solely on the best plan for the employee relative to health care services and
cost; asked if there is a link between this system and the Infor system; and asked if employees are required
to use this software.
Trevor McAleer asked if the cost is on a per employee basis or flat fee per year; asked what is the cost per
employee and if this will be available year round and not just during Open Enrollment; asked if there will
be tracking on employee use and if the County will be charged for only those employees utilizing the
system; and asked for clarification on the sole source procurement process and asked how the County
can be sure that this is the only provider for these services.
Lenora Lockett confirmed that this was posted to the County’s website for the required 5-day period as a
sole source purchase, as stated in Ms. Woods presentation.
15

 Mr. McAleer asked how the department became aware of this this vendor and determined them to be a
sole source provider of these services; and asked if the vendor’s claim as a sole source provider is due to
the ability to recommend a plan based on the data input.
Ms. Lockett explained that the sole source process is based on specific needs to achieve the overarching
goal of the department and a process including a public posting to solicit responses to services being
sought; and stated that the vendor must provide a sole source affidavit stating that no other vendor can
provide services.
Mr. McAleer agreed with Ms. Lockett that this is the policy to conduct a sole source purchase but posting
to the website for 5 days is not a guarantee that the purchase is a true sole source because it may not be
viewed by all potential vendors in the 5-day period; asked if Oswald Companies, the County’s healthcare
consultant, has reviewed this request.
Joseph Nanni asked if registered Buyspeed vendors for related services are also contacted in addition to
the sole source posting.
Ms. Lockett stated that is not a requirement of the standard procedure for a sole source purchase and
restated that it is based on the department’s specific service need.
Mr. Miller asked if this is the first time the County will be using this tool and if the contract provides for
renewal options if this system proves beneficial; and asked why benefit counselors were not well-received
by employees in prior years.
Dennis Kennedy asked if this vendor is insured for liability in the event a recommendation may not be
suitable for the employee in terms of cost and services; asked if costs are incorporated into the
recommendation and how does the system know what the costs will be to the employee; asked if the
system will store the employee information and if there is the potential for privacy issues in the event of
a security breach.
Mr. Kennedy asked for clarification on the backup materials and for confirmation that this received
Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) approval.
Mr. McAleer asked why the system would recommend any other plan besides MetroHealth, which is the
least expensive plan offered to employees; and expressed his concern over identifying this contract as a
sole source.
Mr. Kennedy asked if the Department of Law has an opinion on this issue. Jered Zibritosky, Department
of Law, indicated that he would need to research this matter and did not have an opinion at this time.
Ms. Lockett stated that the Board has the discretion to proceed with an award based on an RFP exemption
rather than sole source and they also have the option to hold this item; said that there are additional
procurement methods that may be utilized such as a formal Request for Proposals; however at this point
there is not enough time to conduct a formal process; and further stated that a Request for Proposals
should always be the default procurement process.

 Mr. Kennedy asked if this contract must be effective on 7/22/2019 or can this be delayed; asked when
Open Enrollment begins; asked why this request had not been submitted earlier to allow for potential
delays, which would not interfere with Open Enrollment.
Mr. McAleer recommended that this item be held for one week. Mr. Miller asked if a one-week delay
would still allow for Open Enrollment to occur on time.
Mr. Kennedy stated that he will work with County Council members to resolve the outstanding questions
related to this item and recommended to hold the request for one week. The remaining Board members
concurred with Mr. Kennedy’s recommendation.

Detailed Explanation of Necessity
Increased Plan Quantities:
Reference No. 7 “Walk Removed and Reference No. 17 “5” Concrete Walk, As Per Plan
These items went over quantity due to concrete walk not being shown on plans to be removed in the
commercial areas where the curb was shown removed and replaced. Sidewalk next to ADA ramps were
not called out to be removed. In some areas, more than one sidewalk block needed to be removed so
the slope to the ADA ramp would be compliant.

29

 Reference No. 73 “6” Non-Reinforced Concrete Pavement, Class QC MS, As Per Plan
This quantity has gone above estimate due to areas where curb was called out to be replaced, the
concrete aprons were not shown to be replaced. In Beachwood where the Dominion installed a new gas
line, curb was “capped” with concrete and not replaced. To replace the curb, one half of the apron
needed to be removed to form the new curb.
Reference No. 75 “Curb, Type using Class QC MS Concrete, As Per Plan”
This quantity went over due to low estimate for bidding and areas where the Dominion installed new
gas line, curb was “capped” with concrete and not replaced. This capped curb area is starting to fail.
New Items:
Reference No. 125 “8” Reinforced Concrete Pavement, Class QC1”
This item wasn’t included in the original bid. This will be a bigger issue in Section 2 where all the aprons
are in commercial driveways.
Reference Nos. 126-130 “Maintenance of Traffic”
These items are for the temporary striping to restrict one of the dual left or right turn lanes that directed
traffic into the project. The plans didn’t have any MOT for any of the dual left turn and right turn lanes
into the project. These lanes are outside of the project area leading into the project where only two-way
traffic was maintained.
Reference Nos. 131-134 “Curb Ramps”
These items were shown on plan, but no quantity or costs were in the project.

The Department of Public Works is requesting approval to participate in the City of Brecksville
Purchasing Consortium for the purchase of Sodium Chloride (Salt) for the 2019/2020 winter season. The
primary goal is to use the consortium purchasing leverage to purchase salt from one vendor for the
period of 11/1/19 - 10/31/20. By having a vendor in place that can provide salt, our building areas and
parking areas will be treated accordingly so the risk of tumbling and accidents is reduced during the
winter season. This will result in a not-to-exceed departmental order in the amount of $49,500.00
Procurement
The City of Brecksville released a public bid for sodium chloride for the 2018/2019 season and the low
bidder that achieved specifications was selected. For the 2019/2020, the Consortium is pursuing a
renewal to the agreement. The last time this was bid competitively was 2018, by the City of Brecksville.

The Sheriff’s Department is requesting an alternate procurement for Jail equipment repairs to provide
flexibility in repairing various equipment in the Jail facilities. This request is to establish a not-to-exceed
award with multiple vendors through December 31, 2020 with an amount not-to-exceed $150,000.00.
These repairs are often emergency repairs or repairs that Public Works is unable to complete and are
critical to continuing Jail operations. Such repairs have historically been paid for on office vouchers or
other means and processes, but annual amounts for each vendor may exceed the $1,000.00 office
voucher threshold. This alternate procurement would allow for quick repairs to maintain jail equipment
operation, limiting downtime of equipment such as kitchen appliances, wrist band machines, floor
scrubbers, radios, ventilation fans, washers/dryers, etc.
The amount of $150,000.00 was established due to current estimates that the Sheriff’s Department
spends up to $50,000.00 annual on repairs. The requested not-to-exceed amount is higher as the County
anticipates a surge of repairs to kitchen equipment prior to a full service food vendor taking over kitchen
operations. It is anticipated that after the vendor begins operations, the County will have limited
responsibility for maintaining kitchen equipment, resulting in a decreased annual overall spend on repairs.
This alternate procurement would allow for Department Orders to be processed for various repairs in the
Jail completed by approved vendors. These individual Department Order payments over $1,000.00 would
be processed in BuySpeed, providing the necessary procurement documentation, but would not require
additional board of control approval. Repairs that are not critical to jail operations will continue to follow
the established County procurement procedures.
The anticipated approved vendors have historically provided various repairs within the Jail. These vendors
provided their hourly rate quotes in response to an informal BuySpeed bid, SH-19-46128.
