CITY PLANNING COMMISSION
68.
Tate, reso. autho. Request of the Downtown Development Authority in conjunction
with Olympia Development of Michigan to amend Article XVII, District Map No.
3 of Chapter 61 of the Detroit City Code, Zoning and the provisions of the existing
PD (Planned Development) zoning district established by Ordinance 10-15 on land
bounded by Woodward Ave. on the east, the south side of Henry St. on the south,
Clifford Ave. and Cass Ave. on the west and Sproat St. on the North; and to rezone
a portion of the remaining B4 (General Commercial) zoned land along the east side
of Cass Ave. between Sproat St. and Henry St., and, as well as the to-be-vacated
Henry Street right-of-way, to PD. (REQUESTING 6TH EXTENSION OF
REVIEW PERIOD)(CPC is pleased to report that the revised petition #1388
requesting the right-of-way adjustments on and around the arena site is being
processed by City Engineering. This revised petition, if acceptable to DPD and
DWSD, should relieve the blockage to completing the vacation of Henry and
the other streets thus allowing the necessary sequence of events to proceed in
order to facilitate the long-held PD rezoning and modification. Consequently,
the CPC requests another 120-day extension of the review period to avoid
having to re-start the ordinance revision process over again at the Planning
Commission. A resolution to that effect is attached for Your consideration.
The requested extension, if granted, will expire by the close of the day Friday,
July 26, 2019.)
