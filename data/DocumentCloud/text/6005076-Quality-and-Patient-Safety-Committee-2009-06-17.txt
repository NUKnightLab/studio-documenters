A measure of quality .In the prevention of surgical

prevent wound infections for particular types of surgery.
This measure looks al how often hospItal surgical patients
get the appropriate ant!blotlcs in order to prevent a surgical
wound infection. The rate is determined by dividing the
number of patients who receIVed the appropriate antibiotic
by the total number of patients receiving antibiotics prior to
surgery.
A measure of quality in the prevention of surgical
complications Taking antibiotics for more than 24 hours
after routine surgery is usually not necessary and can
increase the risk of side effects. such as stomach aches.
serious types of diarrhea and antibiotic resistance. The rate
is determined by dividing the number of patients in which
antibiotics were discontinued within 24 hours after surgery
by the total number of patients receiving antibiotics prior to
surger/,
A measure of quality in the prevention of surgical
complications. Even If heart surgery patients do not have
diabetes, keeping their blood sugar under good control after
surgery lowers the risk of infection and other problems.
'Under good control" means their blood sugar should be
200 mg!dl or less when checked first thing in the morning.
The rate is determined by dividing the number of patients in
which the blood sugar was under good control after cardiac
surgery by the total number of patients who underwent

Prepar'log a patient for surgery May include removing body
hair from the skin in the area where the surgery will be
done. Medical research has shown that shaving with a
razor can increase the risk of infection. It is safer to use
electric clippers or hair removal cream. The rate is

safer method of hair removal by the total number of patients
who have hair removal prior to surgery.

A measure of quality In the prevention of post-surgical blood
clots The risk of developing blood clots can be reducad
through preventative treatments such as blood thinning
medications. elastic support stockings or mechanical air
stockings that promote circulation in the legs. The rate is

thromboembolism prophylaxis is ordered by the number of
patients eligible for prophylaxIs.

A measure of quality In the prevention of post-surgical blood

Category C: An error occurred that reached the patient but did not cause patient
hann.
Category D: An error occurred that resulted in the need for increased patient 

monitoring but no patient harm. 

Category E: An error occurred that resulted in the need for treatment or 

intervention and caused temporary patient harm 

Category F: An error occurred that resulted in initial or prolonged 

hospitalization and caused temporary patient harm. 

Category G: An error occurred that resulted in permanent patient hann 

Category H: An error occurred that resulted in a near-death event (e.g., 

anaphylaxis, cardiac arrest)
.

Category I: An error occurred that resulted in patient death

March 2009
Dashboard Details: 

In March 2009 two patients were referred to Gift of Hope and both were medically ruled out for donation. There was one missed referral from the Neuro ICU. 

Missed Referral: 

03119109 - 631M1B - Neuro leu - This patient was admitted after striking his head on the sidewalk. Upon arrival to the ER on 3/15 he had no response to pain and a GCS of 3. 

On 3/16 he had a documented loss of pupils. and still no response \0 pain. His GCS was 3 for the majority of his hospitalization. The MD spoke with the family on 3/16 and told 

them that he would not survive, and that he recommended withdrawal of care. The family asked for a few days to allow the rest of the family to come and see him before they 

withdrew care. On 3119 the patient coded on the vent and expired. Gift of Hope was not called until after the patient expired. He should have been referred to Gift of Hope 

upon arrival to the Neuro ICU when he had a loss of neurologic function. MR# 1911033 


Improvement Opportunities: 

To ensure the opportunity of organ and tissue donation for all families the follOwing is recommended: 

• Develop and implement a hospital wide Donation-After-Cardiac Death policy to allow all eligible families the opportunity of donation.
Implement a monthly quality review committee to discuss referrals/donors and ways to improve the process in order to hard wire best donation practices in the units.
• Continue to call in all imminent deaths, especially prior to any terminal extubation, in a timely manner to ensure Gift of Hope has the opportunity to evaluate for organ potential.
• Partner with Gift of Hope in community education (i.e. informational booths) in efforts to increase organ donation awareness among the population served by Stroger.
