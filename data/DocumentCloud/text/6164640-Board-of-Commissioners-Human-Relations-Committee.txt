WHEREAS, the ?ve million US. citizen children and two million children brought to this nation as infants,
and raised here among US. citizens, should not be deprived of the sacred right to family and parental
guidance and support upon unnecessary separation; and

WHEREAS, President Obama issued executive orders which provided the deferral of deportation and
the provision of work authorization for undocumented individuals brought to this country as minors and
further established the practice of prosecutorial discretion to defer deportations until the Congress could
arrive at a permanent solution; and

WHEREAS, in Spite of the continuing threat of injustice to children, the current administration has
cancelled those practices without Congress having established any alternative; and

WHEREAS, these provisions represented a just and much needed temporary relief and should be
maintained by act of Congress; and

WHEREAS, the children of those undocumented individuals are being forced every day to endure the
unimaginable pain and damage of family separation or deportation; and

WHEREAS, parents with US. citizen children who were given protected status through prosecutorial
discretion and who reported regularly to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) as they were
required were among the ?rst to be deported under this administration; and

WHEREAS, there has been a 250% increase over the last year in deportations of those with no criminal
records, most of which have families and children, with the likelihood that these numbers will continue to
increase; and

WHEREAS, at least 325,000 Salvadorans, Nicaraguans, Hondurans, and Haitians have lived in this
country for many years and have established families with 273,000 US. born citizen children, as well as
other children brought here at an early age who have known no other country, now face the cancellation
of TPS and are being deported; and

WHEREAS, the educational. health, and economic effects of separation from their parents
have long-term effects on a child?s quality-of-lit?e.

NOW, THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, the Cook County Board President and the Cook County
Board of Commissioners resolve this day that Congress should pass legislation that provides the right to
visas for the undocumented parents of US. citizen children or DACA eligible children, and of

TPS-recipient parents with US. citizen children or [)ACA-eligiblc children; and

FURTHER BE IT RESOLVED, that these Visas should be renewable every three years on proof of
the continued veri?cation of the original conditions ofissue; and
