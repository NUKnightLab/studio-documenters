a. Summary of public comment process by Erin Conley, Rules Coordinator: The Department files its
rulemakings with the Secretary of State for First Notice publication in the Illinois Register. The First
Notice public comment period runs a minimum of 45 days from the date the rulemaking is published
in the Illinois Register. Formal Joint Committee on Administrative Rules (JCAR) review begins when
the Department files its rulemaking for second notice with JCAR. Part of the second notice submission

 to JCAR is a description of comments that were received and the Department’s response to comment
(along with any proposed language changes to the rulemaking). After the Department files with JCAR
for second notice we can only make changes to the rulemaking if JCAR is in agreement with the
changes.
b. 77 IAC 692 AIDS Drug Assistance Program— Board recommends filing with the Secretary of State for
First Notice.
