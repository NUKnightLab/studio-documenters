Great.

Thanks, Mr. Chairman.

4

Good morning to all of you.

guests.

6

substantive part of the agenda, I wanted to let

7

you know about some board member updates.

8
9

Good morning to our

Before we really jump into the

Alderman Villegas who we expect
shortly, Alderman Gil Villegas is Alderman of the

10

36th Ward and he was recently appointed by Mayor

11

Emanuel to join our Advisory Board.

12

vacancy that he is filling, so there is no other

13

changes on our Advisory Board.

14

Alderman Villegas who will be joining us shortly.

15

There was a

So we welcome

Also, Alderman Jason Ervin, Alderman

16

of the 28th Ward, has been appointed to our Board

17

of Directors.

18

Council approval process, and we expect that that

19

will be finalized later on this month and then he

20

will officially be on our Board of Directors.

21

And that is going through the City

That, of course, unfortunately means

22

that Alderman O'Shea will be graduating from our

23

Board of Directors and becoming the Chairman of

24

the Aviation Committee on the City Council.
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

So

 Report of Proceedings - July 17, 2018

1

while we are very, very excited for him; we are

2

very sad to be losing you from our Board.

3

Alderman, you have been a champion of the CIT and

4

a wonderful partner and we look forward to

5

working with you in your new role on our

6

projects, but we will miss you very much and we

7

wish you all the best.

Villegas.

ALDERMAN VILLEGAS:
MS. DARLING:

So and here is Alderman

Sorry, I'm late.

That's okay.

Welcome to you.

11

As you also may have read or saw, Kym Hubbard has

12

also departed from our Board.

13

appointed to an additional for-profit board which

14

she is very excited about.

15

reducing her nonprofit load and so she is leaving

16

the CIT Board.

17

She has been

And so she is

And also Jorge Ramirez is making a

18

transition from the President of the CFL.

19

moving on to the private sector and, therefore,

20

that board slot is for somebody representing

21

labor.

22

right now to appoint a new representative of the

23

labor movement to our Board of Directors.

24

He is

So we are working with the Mayor's Office

So we are very excited about those

transitions.

Looking forward to welcoming

2

Alderman Ervin and Alderman Villegas and we're

3

very appreciative of our board members who have

4

served so ably and helpfully.

5

and a special thank you to Alderman O'Shea.

So we thank you

6

I did want to take a quick minute also

7

to introduce Tessie Lin who is sitting at the end

8

of the table here.

9

She is at Loyola University.

She's our new summer intern.
She's an accounting

10

and business major.

11

of days a week this summer.

Tessie.

14

get to know her.

15

And she is with us a couple
And so we welcome

We've really enjoyed working with her so

We also have a client here with us,

16

Dan Burke, who is the Chief Engineer from the

17

Chicago Department of Transportation.

18

working very closely with Dan on both our O'Hare

19

Express Project and also our Smart Lighting

Project which continue and we'll be giving you

updates on both of those today.

provide a little more information for some

in-depth things if you have questions on those

6

items as we go through the agenda today.
CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

All right.

Next we have

3

Mr. Watson from Benford Brown to go through our

4

independent auditor's report for this fiscal year

5

2017.

6
7

MR. WATSON:

Good morning, everybody.

Can

those on the phone hear me?

8

MR. SILVERS:

9

MR. WATSON:

Yes, I can hear you.
Okay.

Good.

Thank you for

10

inviting me to present the audit report for the

11

year ending December 31, 2017.

12

the highlights of this report and give you kind

13

of a general summary of the results of our audit.

14

All right.

I will go through

For those of you that have

15

copies of the audit report, if you could flip to

16

pages one and two.

17

report itself and just as a highlight we provided

18

what's called an unmodified opinion as the

19

technical term.

20

clean opinion.

21

On those pages is the actual

The layman's term is that it's a

We are pleased to report that we found

22

that the financial statements properly

23

represented the financial position and the

24

changes in the net assets for the year 2017.
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

As

 Report of Proceedings - July 17, 2018

7

1

a part of our procedures, we also took a look at

2

the information from the prior year.

3

report as a part of this report that we agreed

4

with the results from the prior year as well.

5

page two at the top is where you will find that

6

opinion.

7

And we did

Now, some of the highlights of the

8

financial statements and what we're going to

9

cover in the next few pages -- I actually will

10

flip forward a bit just to make this a little

11

easier for you guys to see.

12

On

There are a lot of numbers on the

13

financial statements themselves, but the ones

14

that we specifically want to point out is that

15

the total assets from 2017 to 2016, there was a

16

slight decrease, a 1 percent decrease in total

17

assets between the 2 years.

18

this decrease is related to accumulated

19

depreciation increasing which is kind of a normal

20

situation particularly when the assets do not

21

shift very much.

22

The main reason for

One of the things that I will say

23

though is if you take a look at the assets, you

24

will notice an increase in cash which obviously
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 Report of Proceedings - July 17, 2018

1

is a good situation for the organization.

2

The total liabilities also decreased

3

about 4 percent.

4

decrease of the total assets, that's actually

5

pretty good.

6

fact that Chicago Infrastructure Trust had a

7

pretty good year as far as net profits are

8

concerned and some of those were used towards

9

paying off debt.

10

So in comparison to the

And part of this is related to the

And then finally the total

11

unrestricted net assets which represent the

12

accumulated nets or losses over the life of the

13

organization actually increase 17 percent from

14

the prior year.

15

net profit that the organization realized during

16

2017.

17

Again, this is related to the

If you flip to page 4, it's a much

18

more detailed description of what I've got

19

showing on the screen.

20

point of view, if you take a look at the revenue

21

from 2017 to 2016.

22

2,856,000.

23

from the prior year.

24

is that the way that the Chicago Infrastructure

But from a high-level

In 2017 revenue in total was

That was about a 4 percent decrease

Trust is set up operationally, you receive grants

2

from the City, the revenue there remains the same

3

from 2016 to 2017.

4

revenues that are being earned from the Retrofit

5

Project.

6

year to year.

7

looking at there is related to the change in the

8

Retrofit revenue.

9

However, there is also

And that revenue does fluctuate from
And so the fluctuation that we're

And then the total expenses from 2017

10

to 2016, there was an increase of 9 percent.

11

Those expenses increased largely due to

12

depreciation increasing related largely to the

13

Retrofit assets.

14

increases in operational expenses.

15

Okay.

And then there were some slight

So beyond the actual financial

16

statements and the auditor's report, we also had

17

some other communications that are required for

18

the Board.

19

front of you or not.

20

I just covered as far as the results of the

21

audit.

22

what our responsibilities were as the audit firm.

23

The -- whether there were any other matters that

24

needed to be reported such as any material

I'm not certain that they are in
However, they do cover what

And there are also statements regarding

1

weaknesses or significant deficiencies in

2

internal controls or if there were any

3

adjustments that we requested to be included as a

4

part of the financial results.

5

And I'm pleased to say as a part our

6

process we did review internal controls.

We did

7

not find any situations where we felt that there

8

needed to be anything reported to the board.

9

There were no material weaknesses and we didn't

10

see anything that made us think there were any

11

significant deficiencies and we didn't have any

12

audit adjustments either.

13

And just a little bit more

14

information.

15

where we spelled out our responsibilities as well

16

as management's responsibilities related to the

17

audit.

the financial statements for 2017.

20

anyone have any questions about the audit report?

3

Thank you.

No questions?

I want to thank

Tim Watson from Bedford Brown.

efforts.

12

Dominguez who runs our office and manages these

13

relationships with our auditor and our accountant

14

and really helped us make sure we had a good

15

clean audit and our financial statements are in

16

good shape.

17

And so thank you both for your
And also a special thank you to Patty

So thanks to all of you.

I do want to mention that as far as

18

these numbers are concerned, this is a

19

combination of both our operating and Retrofit

20

One.

21

the funds that come from the City for Retrofit

22

One are absolutely restricted and can only be

23

used for the Retrofit One Project.

24

wanted to make that differentiation to you.

So there is a lot of restricted funds.

So I just

individually.

carryover from our December board meeting where

2

we had a conditional unanimous approval of the

3

2018 budget, but we are required to get a final

4

approval at this meeting.

5

And so from the forwarded financial

6

information that I previously sent to you which

7

is our midyear update and I think you may have in

front of you, that as you can see we're either on

or below budget for every item that I've reported

to you.

limited resources.

MS. DARLING:

Thank you all very much for

the -- for your patience during that part of the

agenda.

7

Tim, I think if there is no other

8

items or questions for our auditor, we appreciate

9

you being here.

You don't have to stay for the

10

rest of the meeting although you are welcome.

11

And, Yesenia, for you as well.

12

for being here.

13

Thank you both

So at this point we will get into our

14

project update section.

15

with the O'Hare Express System update.

16

last spoke and all met we had recently released

17

the request for qualifications for the O'Hare

18

Express Project where we designed a very

19

ambitious RFQ that was outside the mold of risk

20

sharing with the private sector.

21

So we are going to start
When we

We were asking for a private operator

22

to pay for the design, construction and operation

23

of an express system between downtown and O'Hare.

24

We asked for a goal travel time of 20 minutes or
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

14

 Report of Proceedings - July 17, 2018

1

less with trips departing at least every 15

2

minutes in order to help mitigate congestion and

3

foster economic growth.

4

This is a real game changing project.

5

It's -- it ties the two financial centers of the

6

City of Chicago together in hopes that it would

7

be a -- connect them very quickly and make the

8

trip easy and accessible to both visitors and

9

residents to use the system to get someplace that

10

takes a very long time to get to if you're

11

heading to O'Hare especially on the Kennedy, but

12

also on the blue line in hopes to have -- with

13

the hopes of having a new option for people.

14

So we put the RFQ out there and we

15

have progressed this procurement in coordination

16

with our partners at CDOT, at the CTA and many,

17

many other City departments.

18

of people at the City who are working on this

19

important project.

20

thanks to Tom Budescu who has been quarterbacking

21

this project for the CIT and has done an

22

outstanding job.

23

give the more detailed update because he's been

24

really running the show for us and we're very

So, Tom.

MR. BUDESCU:

Thanks.

So as Leslie

3

mentioned, the last time we met the RFQ had

4

already been issued.

5

November 29th, 2017, so pardon our typo.

6

after our last board meeting we did hold a

7

presubmittal conference at the Chicago Cultural

8

Center in coordination with the City.

9

really a great event.

It was issued actually on
Soon

It was

You know, it was really

10

close to Christmas and we got over 300 attendees

11

from across the country.

12

about it.

13

developers, financiers, as well as local

14

subcontractors and professional services firms

15

all very interested in the project and the

16

opportunity looking to team up around the

17

opportunity.

18

We were really excited

A great mix of global infrastructure

We did receive four statements of

19

qualification in February.

The responses really

20

validated the conceptual project structure that

21

we put together.

22

bit unorthodoxed, a bit ambitious in terms of the

23

risk sharing.

24

qualifications validated that approach to us.

As Leslie mentioned, it was a

And the statements of

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

16

 Report of Proceedings - July 17, 2018

1

Ultimately we short listed the two

2

teams that were deemed most qualified to deliver

3

the project around the proposed -- within the

4

framework of the proposed structure.

5

were The Boring Company and O'Hare Express,

6

L.L.C., which was a consortium of a number of

7

infrastructure players:

8

Fund, JLC Infrastructure, Mott MacDonald, First

9

Transit among others.

10

Those teams

Meridian Infrastructure

Both teams were invited to participate

11

in the RFP process and both did provide

12

comprehensive proposals.

13

you know, I really wanted to sort of take a

14

moment and convey our appreciation for the effort

15

and thoughtfulness of both teams.

16

to do a lot of work in a really short period of

17

time, and I think both teams delivered very

18

informative and thorough proposals.

19

And on May 18 -- and,

We asked them

The Boring Company's proposal was

20

evaluated as the one offering the best value to

21

the City and were invited to the exclusive

22

negotiations phase on June 14th, 2018.

23
24

Now, we are in this exclusive
negotiation phase still within the procurement

process.

2

actually end until the City Council takes

3

affirmative action and approval of the form of

4

contract as will be presented through an

5

ordinance at the conclusion of the negotiations

6

phase.

7

The procurement process does not

During the exclusive negotiations

8

phase the Infrastructure Trust is leading the

9

coordination between The Boring Company, the City

10

and the sister agencies, particularly the CTA.

11

There is a number of working groups we're leading

12

really working to develop and manage a clear

13

mutually agreed to execution plan for advancing

14

all the necessary work screens as expeditiously

15

as possible.

16

legal consideration within the contract as well

17

as the technical considerations around the design

18

and operation and the regulatory considerations

19

for the project as a whole.

20

So this includes the commercial and

But, again, at the end of the day this

21

is not going to be a CIT contract.

The contract

22

will be between the City and The Boring Company

23

directly and will be subject to the approval of

24

the City Council.
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services

18

 Report of Proceedings - July 17, 2018

1

So that's kind of a high-level

2

overview of where we are in the process.

3

then we wanted to also give you a little more

4

detail on what exactly it is that The Boring

5

Company is proposing to do in terms of their

6

solution.

7

And

So, you know, it's a really ambitious

8

plan and one that doesn't have a completely

9

analogous precedent and we're really excited

10

about developing this along with the City and The

11

idea that they can be done economic -- within the

economics of the project to fully fund it and

that's something that The Boring Company has

stepped up and said that they can do it and they

are willing to put their money on the line to do

so.

the timeline we're looking at right now to

negotiate the contract.

of pre-construction permitting issues that have

to be achieved and milestones met and then the

still on the horizon.

done through condemnation or what is the legal

method for gaining access to the route?

MS. DARLING:

Sure.

That's a great

question.

working with The Boring Company to determine the
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services

25

 Report of Proceedings - July 17, 2018

route that they will take, but as of right now

MS. CAFARO:

MS. DARLING:

Okay.

And then the cost to

Yeah, sorry.
Well, I'm just asking.
Yes, the goal was to be

substantially less than a taxi or a ride share.

10

As of right now they are looking at less than

11

$25.

12

MS. CAFARO:

Less than 25.

Okay.

Thank you

13

and then one really practical question in the

14

vehicles, what is the accommodation that's made

15

for luggage and how is it designed?

16

it's very thoughtfully designed, but it's hard to

17

tell from the rendering.

very much still in flux, but it will be able to

MS. CAFARO:

Okay.

Thank you.

2

MS. DARLING:

Damon.

3

MR. SILVERS:

Thank you, Leslie.

So I think

4

this is -- this is really -- we discussed this at

5

the last meeting.

6

minutes in advance of this meeting.

7

know, I think where we are in this is so the

8

testimony to the idea that this Trust can do big

9

things.

I was just reviewing the
And, you

This is a critical project I think for,

10

in my view, for Chicago, Chicago's

11

competitiveness.

12

on getting that time under 30 -- getting that

13

time down under 30 minutes is very important in

14

terms of how Chicago will compete globally.

15

And I think your team's focus

It's funny, I am puzzled.

If I

16

understand right, the vehicle is a Tesla chassis.

17

And I frankly just don't understand how you could

18

fit 16 passengers and luggage, but maybe they'll

19

double decker.

20

But I have two rather more sort of

21

serious things I want to raise with the team and

22

ask your reflections on.

23

what I raised in the last -- in part follows up

24

on what I raised in the last meeting, but is

The first follows up on

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

27

 Report of Proceedings - July 17, 2018

1

actually broader.

2

At the last meeting I was raising the

3

question of the cost of capital for this project

4

and making sure that we were on top of that and

5

understanding what the drivers of it were in

6

terms of the credit worthiness of the private

7

managers of this project.

8

concern is really heightened by the decision to

9

do an exclusive negotiation with The Boring

And I think that

10

Company because The Boring Company is part of a

11

family of companies associated with Elon Musk.

12

And Elon Musk and his family of companies raises

13

unique issues in terms of credit worthiness and

14

cost of capital which I think we need to be very

15

attentive to.

16

I mean, on the surface they are a

17

source of strength.

18

Tesla's stock price has been very high, but there

19

are operational problems associated with Tesla

20

that are serious that the capital markets are

21

increasingly skeptical about.

22

structure of Elon Musk Enterprises are dependent

23

upon keeping the stock price of Tesla up.

24

All right.

Obviously

And the entire

And so I want, A, I would like, A, to
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

28

 Report of Proceedings - July 17, 2018

1

hear what the team's view on sort of how this

2

project is going to be analyzed in terms of

3

whether the sister companies of The Boring

4

Company are going to be viewed as a source of

5

strength here and what the contingency plan is if

6

they turn out to be a source of weakness.

7

In relation to that it also concerns

8

me that as I think everyone knows the Musk Family

9

Companies are engaged in a lot of things.

Many

10

of which are complicated and challenging.

At the

11

same time as they are trying to deal with the

12

problems they have in the Tesla Company and in

13

manufacturing.

14

really have the managerial capacity to execute on

15

all the things that they're involved with as a

16

family of companies is a concern to me and

17

something where I feel like we ought to kick the

18

tires very hard.

19

And the question of whether they

I reflect in particular on the

20

announcement they made last fall during the

21

Puerto Rico crisis that they were going to fix

22

the Puerto Rican electric power grid.

23

that they have not done and as far as I know got

24

nowhere on.

Something

That might not be their fault, but

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

29

 Report of Proceedings - July 17, 2018

1

the point is that they are -- they are making a

2

lot of commitments to a lot of places.

3

need to be sure that we are dealing with a set of

4

enterprises that have not only the financial

5

capacity, but also the -- and so I would like the

6

staff to reflect on that for a moment.

7

And we

The second concern I have here is very

8

much in the vein of in part why the Mayor asked

9

me to be an Advisory Board Member.

I understand

10

that it is likely that The Boring Company will

11

agree to a project labor agreement which I think

12

is very important in terms of the construction,

13

but it's my understanding that the initial idea

14

here is that they would be a private operator

15

here.

16

specifically of The Boring Company's labor

17

relations history or if we think they have any, a

18

comparable family of companies has been a labor

19

relations disaster.

20

to question whether or not they are capable of

21

operating themselves in the transportation

22

stations in Chicago in a way that the public

23

would expect them to operate.

24

And although I don't know the specifics

And I think is real reason

In particular if you look at Tesla's
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

30

 Report of Proceedings - July 17, 2018

1

experience, hundreds of workers have been fired

2

for trying to organize a union and the safety

3

record of the Tesla factory is frankly in

4

relation to other auto manufacturers, primitive

5

and dangerous.

6

And so I think, again, these problems

7

seem -- these challenges seem to me all

8

potentially soluble, but they require real

9

attention on our part in order to make sure that

10

we're managing risks associated in dealing with

11

this family of companies at this time.

12

And so I wondered if the staff could

13

really address these two points.

14

emphasize again, I believe these things -- these

15

issues can be managed, but they can't be ignored.

16

MS. DARLING:

And I want to

I think I'll start off and

17

then I think Tom and I can both address your

18

statements and questions.

19

say at the outset we are just beginning these

20

negotiations.

21

mentioned, Damon, are things that we are acutely

22

aware of and are going to do everything to make

23

sure that the City's interests are protected 110

24

percent.

Obviously I want to

All of the things that you have

 Report of Proceedings - July 17, 2018

1

This, as we said at the outset, this

2

contract will go before City Council and will

3

have a very, very public airing.

4

assure you that the Aldermen both in the room and

5

in City Council will be looking at the very same

6

issues that you've addressed.

And so I can

7

The Musk Family of Companies that you

8

-- that you referenced are generally -- Tesla is

9

publicly traded.

So there is also other

10

attention paid nationally and internationally to

11

this company.

12

And but what you mentioned as far as

13

their credit worthiness and the cost of capital,

14

that is something that we are working on and will

15

be addressed through our contract negotiation

16

phase.

17

substantially more detail of which truthfully we

18

do not have yet because these negotiations are

19

just beginning, we would have to go into

20

executive session.

I think if we want to get into

21

But honestly we do not have more

22

information to share at this point with the

23

exception of we are acutely aware of these issues

24

and will make sure that the City's interests are

33

represented and the interests of the City and our

2

taxpayers are fully represented.

3

I think, Tom, if you want to address a

4

couple of other issues I know we sort of talked

5

about.

6

MR. BUDESCU:

I guess I would note that with

7

regards to exposure to the corporate affiliates

8

of The Boring Company is that much like any other

9

public/private partnership project and agreement.

10

The goal here is going to be to structure a

11

project specific vehicle that is distinct from

12

its parent company and corporate affiliates and

13

so the credit worthiness of the project should be

14

ring fenced from the credit worthiness of the

15

foreign company's corporation and certainly from

16

its affiliates.

17

we're working on and it's a big point of focus.

18

Now, how that's done in practice

Let's see, you know, I think the other

19

things as Leslie mentioned, we're very much --

20

oh, the other thing I wanted to talk about is

21

your concern about their managerial capacity.

22

can say as of right now they have been very much

23

devoting the necessary resources.

24

As we move forward I think it's
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

I

 Report of Proceedings - July 17, 2018

1

important to understand the project agreement

2

will include, you know, both traditional

3

infrastructure project guarantees such as surety

4

bond performance and payment bond as well as, you

5

know, parent company guarantees or something akin

6

to them.

7

on the hook for more than the full capital costs

8

of the project.

9

that we're talking about here as a revenue risk

What this does is essentially put them

And given the payment structure

10

concession not as a construction progress

11

payment, milestone payment contract, nobody is

12

more incentivized to devote the resources to the

13

project than the entity that's funding it with

14

hundreds of millions if not one billion or more

15

dollars at the outset of the project as well as

16

providing contingent guarantees that will have,

17

you know, effective triggers and remedies for the

18

City.

19

So I think the incentives are there to

20

say that it would be very difficult for them to

21

walk away from the project or not devote the

22

amount of resources from them unless they want to

23

take a really significant hit to the equity

24

investment that they are making into the project.

And as far as the operations

2

issues that you mentioned, Damon, as far as being

a private operator, part of what we will be

4

negotiating during the contract phase are some

5

very strict standards for performance of the

6

operations of the system and those will have to

be met.

financial strength from the Musk Family of

3

But the planning on us I would assume

4

this kind of -- as you said this ring-fenced

5

approach.

6

addressed it, but I think it's a critical thing

7

here is that as you think about the consequences

of refusal -- failure to perform and what the

9

City's remedies are, I think it's extremely

The critical piece and several of you

10

important that we not -- that we look for

to the operations problem, I think that may well

turn out to be the most attractable aspect of

6

this.

7

labor relations issues that I raised which

8

obviously are the ones I'm most familiar with.

And I think it actually goes beyond the

But I think there is another question

10

here which is that, you know, does this firm

11

really know how to operate a transit system?

12

They may know how to bore a big tunnel and they

13

may know how to design the software of the

14

vehicle, but that's a very different thing than

15

operating a transit system and as I think

16

everyone -- everyone who is familiar at all with

17

life in the City of Chicago is aware.

18

think we ought to really be thoughtful about

19

what's the best way to make sure that this very

20

innovative piece of technology is actually

21

operated effectively.

22

MS. DARLING:

And I

That is something that we have

spent a lot of time thinking about and I think

there will be lots of ways to address this that
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

37

 Report of Proceedings - July 17, 2018

1

will be addressed during the contract negotiation

2

process.

3

We have taken those into account and we will keep

4

those in mind as we continue the negotiations

5

process.

And I think we hear you loud and clear.

MR. SILVERS:
to talk about this.

I really appreciate the chance
It's very helpful.

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

And, Damon, on the first

issue, Damon, that you raised and the

10

recommendation that you have that we seek

11

guarantees that extend beyond the corpus of the

12

family of companies I think is sort of wise

13

counsel.

14

And that we also, I mean, you made a

15

few examples, but when we talk about Enron is a

16

good example that at the corporate level there

17

were a lot of different guarantees that were

18

provided and not very easily traced through a lot

19

of subsidiary entities.

20

case, you know, there runs a similar opportunity

21

for us to just be mindful and diligent about with

22

respect to, you know, where such kind of bold

23

visions have led to corporate guarantees

24

elsewhere with other projects and elsewhere in

And I think in this

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

38

 Report of Proceedings - July 17, 2018

1

the world.

2

And I think that finding, you know,

3

sufficient ways obviously the team is on top of

4

this, but I think it's good counsel to say let's

5

look beyond that place as where we would

6

typically sort of find security, right, for

7

financial support.

8

MR. BUDESCU:

So I think we're acutely

9

focussed on exactly those issues and are really

10

looking to create performance guarantees on the

11

project that attenuate the risk for across the

12

board.

13

focussed on and that everything that has been

14

said about operations is fair.

And that's very much something we are

15

I would also say, again, unlike a

16

typical performance services contract, no one is

17

more incented in the case of this project

18

structure to make the operations work than the

19

entity whose capital is at risk if revenues don't

20

materialize.

21

standards.

22

regime with remedies and triggers for the City to

23

enforce that, but I also want to make the point

24

that it's The Boring Company itself that's most

So we're going to have performance
We're going to have a performance

40

1

incented in making the operations work if they

2

ever expect to get repaid or receive a return on

3

their capital.

4

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

I get that, Tom.

Just to

5

be clear like, you know, if I'm a homeowner that

6

is under water on my mortgage, no one is more

7

incentivized to get my mortgage paid and not hand

8

over the keys than me, right.

9

plenty of foreclosures that happen every day.

But there are
So

10

I get that argument as a case and we have

11

incentives aligned, but that doesn't mean that

12

we're not stuck with the keys.

13

MR. BUDESCU:

I understand.

14

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

15

ALDERMAN VILLEGAS:

Other questions?
I just heard that the

16

CIT is not in charge of the O'Hare Express.

17

agency is going to be in charge of that?

18

MS. DARLING:

What

I think that it's still not

19

decided in final, but it's likely that CDOT will

20

be managing the project going forward.

21

not -- that's not a final decision.

22
23
24

ALDERMAN VILLEGAS:

But it's

It's a design-build

project?
MS. DARLING:

It's a design, build, finance,

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 Report of Proceedings - July 17, 2018

1
2

operate, maintain.
ALDERMAN VILLEGAS:

As it relates to on the

3

City's side, is this going to be a PMO of some

4

sort that is going to be working overseeing the

5

project?

6

Because usually typically the construction, 10

7

percent of the construction costs is for

8

professional services.

9

the oversight going to be paid?

10

How is that PMO going to be paid?

MR. BUDESCU:

How is that portion of

I mean, we're working with

11

CDOT right now and it's part of the negotiations

12

phase, but we are looking for The Boring Company

13

to be funding CDOT's costs and overseeing any

14

outside party overseeing the construction of the

15

project through a mutually agreed upon scope and

16

budget.

17
18
19

MS. DARLING:

That will be part of the

negotiation process.
ALDERMAN VILLEGAS:

And then that

20

solicitation will go out?

21

as a separate solicitation?

22

MR. BURKE:

Dan, will that go out

It will go out as a separate

23

solicitation, Alderman.

But in terms of the

24

percentage wise, it will be a much smaller not -Victoria Legal + Corporate Services

be sort of a combined to high-level oversight and

compliance review.

5

from a traditional CDOT --

6
7

We are not

It would just

So that greatly reduced scope

ALDERMAN VILLEGAS:

But also inspections

too, right?

8

MR. BURKE:

9

MS. CAFARO:

Yes.
One question I have in terms of

10

dealing with some of these issues which are front

11

and center that you'll be dealing with during the

12

exclusive negotiation period, in terms of the

13

other -- the consortium who was the other bidder,

14

who qualified, I think it would be useful when

15

you make your assessment also to understand how

16

it would compare to not only the optimal outcome

17

but also any other realistic bidder.

18

sometimes I think we can compare it to

19

perfection, but we also need to understand where

20

we would stand relative to other bidders and what

21

the pros and cons might be even if it's somewhat

22

hypothetical because you won't have gone through

23

the full negotiation process with them.

24

would be helpful for me to understand how to

Because

That

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

42

 Report of Proceedings - July 17, 2018

1

valuate the risks and mitigants that you put in

2

place in a contract with The Boring Company.

3
4

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

That's a great idea.

Alderman Ervin.

5

ALDERMAN ERVIN:

Just one quick question

6

based on the natural wherewithal of this group.

7

How much like equity of theirs is going into the

8

project to go back to your point about the house.

9

That's the reason you put a down payment on the

10

house so you don't want to just walk away from

11

it.

12

from their point for their skin in the game and

13

not this to all just be other peoples' money.

14
15

So from that aspect, what are we looking for

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

In terms of the capital

structure and the financing?

16

ALDERMAN ERVIN:

17

MR. BUDESCU:

Right.

Yeah, I would say that on

18

revenue concessions generally in the market you

19

are typically seeing -- it's hard to get less

20

than 50 percent equity in order to raise the

21

debt.

22

project, you're probably going to be higher than

23

that.

24

to be finalized, but I don't think we're going to

I think given the novel nature of this

And other than, you know, that's all still

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

43

 Report of Proceedings - July 17, 2018

1

be in a situation where we have any less than 50

2

percent equity as part of the financing structure

3

for the project.

4
5
6
7
8
9

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

And is that equity in the

form of cash or is that -ALDERMAN ERVIN:

Right, that was my next

question.
MS. DARLING:

I think that is still subject

to the negotiations.

And so we'll keep you

10

updated on that, but it is subject to the

11

negotiations.

12

is really helpful feedback.

13

to keep these things in mind as the negotiation

14

moves forward.

15

And these are really help -- this

ALDERMAN ERVIN:

And we'll continue

The other part of this is

16

that we have, I mean, I don't want to say we, but

17

the City of Chicago has a tremendous amount of

18

equity in the project with the cost of Block 37

19

and I'm not sure what that number is.

20

it's in excess 100,000 million if I remember

21

correctly.

22

in essence selling it or are we leasing that or

23

what are we -- or are we just contributing that?

24

I think

So we're already we're kind of are we

MS. DARLING:

Again, that's going to be

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

44

 Report of Proceedings - July 17, 2018

1

subject to the negotiation, Alderman, but I can

2

tell you that the City will own the entire

3

project including Block 37.

4

ALDERMAN ERVIN:

5

MS. DARLING:

6

Will own the tunnel?

They will own the entire

system.

7

ALDERMAN ERVIN:

8

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

9

MS. DARLING:

Okay.
Okay.

Thank you.

So at this point I

10

think this has been a good conversation and we

11

appreciate all of your input.

12

would ask that you refer to your resolutions, and

13

we are asking you to ratify the determination of

14

the City to negotiate exclusively with The Boring

15

Company and to take all actions required to get

16

to a contract.

I think

George had a long

10

says hello to everyone, but unfortunately he's on

We have been talking about this for

quite a long time.

you a quick update on what we believe to be

outstanding progress.

Again, Dan Burke works

very closely with us.

So I will not -- I will give

And so as you know this is a large

20

scale LED conversion.

We are going to be

21

converting over 270,000 of the City's

22

high-pressure sodium lights to LED.

23

making up to $30 million in targeted repairs

24

based on the asset condition assessment which I'm

We will be

happy to report has recently been completed.

2

And then installing the technology,

3

the lighting management system, that will allow

4

us to remotely control and also know before we

5

get a call from an Alderman or a citizen about

6

when a light is out and be able to have a more

7

reliable system and provide better quality lights

8

for the citizens of Chicago.

9

So I just want to give you a quick

10

update as to where we are.

We have installed

11

over 65,000 lights so far.

Hopefully some of you

12

as you're driving through the City you've noticed

13

that.

14

operational.

15

lights converted by the end of 2018.

16

can see I don't think -- maybe I have a pointer

17

here.

18

you can see the west side area is complete.

19

happened in June.

20

are happy to report that all of the arterial and

21

residential and alley streets have been completed

22

in that west side area.

23
24

The lighting management system is

I do.

We expect that we will have 100,000
And as you

I have a little pointer here.

So just last month.

As
That

And we

And then on the south side priority
area, that should be completed by the end of this
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 Report of Proceedings - July 17, 2018

1

month.

I think that they are still on schedule

2

for that.

3

assessment was recently completed and the City is

4

currently assessing that data and working with

5

the vendor to help assess the priority areas and

6

where those repairs will be made in the upcoming

7

months and years.

8

month.

9

As I mentioned that pole-by-pole

And that was completed last

I'm also happy to report, and I know I

10

communicated with all of you when the

11

announcement was made, but the City was able to

12

obtain almost $5.75 million worth of ComEd

13

rebates.

14

to incentivize communities to transfer to LED

15

lighting.

16

number of -- there were some excess funds and we

17

were able to obtain those $5.75 million.

18

They're special relates that are just

And so there were -- there was a

We had originally estimated that we

19

would receive only $8 million when we were doing

20

the financial analysis for this project.

21

assumed we would get a maximum of $8 million in

22

relates from ComEd; but from the work that we've

23

done with CDOT and our partners at the City, we

24

estimate we will get $9 million in just 2018

We

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

48

 Report of Proceedings - July 17, 2018

1

alone.

So this is far exceeding what we had

2

originally estimated.

3

And not only is it great for the City,

4

but it also makes great financial sense in even

5

further -- we thought this was a great deal for

6

the City to begin with and now it's even greater

7

because ComEd is giving us these rebates for

8

these lights that we are converting to LED.

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

What's the yellow line on

It is.

right now.

I don't know if you've noticed
I've noticed

I haven't paid attention on

Is north done, Dan, do you know?

MR. BURKE:

I we believe we are nearing

completion.
MS. DARLING:

So that's almost all done.

Alderman Ervin.
ALDERMAN ERVIN:
for Dan.

I have a question as far as

So lighting management system, are you
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

49

 Report of Proceedings - July 17, 2018

1

getting reports on outages yet or is it still

2

kind of not fully functioning?

3

MS. DARLING:

4

ALDERMAN ERVIN:

5
6

I actually know the answer.
Oh, I'm sorry.

I

apologize.
MS. DARLING:

No, no, it's all right.

So 99

7

percent of the fixtures are reporting with

8

information.

9

information is that if they're working, what

So what we know from the

10

their schedule is, what time they go on and off,

11

their wattage, their energy usage, the install

12

date and the fixture information.

13

So right now we should be getting

14

reports about whether they are on or off.

15

we are working with that information.

16

full system is not up and running, but 99 percent

17

of the fixtures that have been installed are

18

reporting to us.

19

on or off.

20

And so

And the

So we should know if they are

ALDERMAN ERVIN:

And then I don't know if

21

you all are experiencing this, but what we're

22

seeing is we still are experiencing either a

23

large number of outages and they may be power

24

related, not necessarily fixture related, but the
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

50

 Report of Proceedings - July 17, 2018

1

one outs are still there.

2

expected that so soon in the -- with these lights

3

that have just been installed.

4

MR. BURKE:

Sure.

I would not have

Alderman, we're working,

5

finishing up the install on the south side

6

priority by the end of this month.

7

to double back and have a very focussed effort to

8

hit those one outs that you're addressing.

9

we anticipate those will be addressed in the very

We are going

And

10

near future.

11

infrastructure or power supply issues and we're

12

investigating each and every one of those and

13

addressing them.

14

Some of those are power -- existing

ALDERMAN ERVIN:

And the second item and

15

this is more of a -- we've been getting a lot of

16

complaints about the lighting levels and the --

17

they're not what they once were and especially

18

behind the -- not the street itself, but the

19

sidewalk, the pedestrian areas.

20

Especially because when this was

21

started and they say, hey, we're going to hit

22

these high-impact areas in the 11th, 10th and

23

15th Districts and it was basically a point of

24

public safety.

And now the question is is this

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

51

 Report of Proceedings - July 17, 2018

1

really effective for public safety if the

2

lighting, especially those on pedestrian areas or

3

the houses, have less light now?

4

ALDERMAN SCOTT:

So let me chime in with him

5

as well.

6

it doesn't throw light like it used to.

7

you don't have piggybacks on the back of those

8

acorns on the back of those lights, it's really

9

hard to get, you know, how we talked about from

10

So you know how the cast of light is -So when

keyhole to keyhole.

11

MS. DARLING:

Right.

12

ALDERMAN SCOTT:

In terms of light.

And it

13

is no longer keyhole to keyhole.

And the light

14

on the street is a lot brighter, however, we do

15

have resident concerns getting from the car to

16

the front door.

17

of CDOT about how do we work through that.

18

know that that's an issue that they're aware of.

I've talked to the Commissioner

19

MS. DARLING:

20

ALDERMAN SCOTT:

I

Yes.
You know, and I don't know

21

if what I suggested and I -- if it's not able,

22

can we do acorn piggybacks on the back of the

23

existing lighting.

24

you have to do the entire -- the entire block in

They won't do that because

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

52

 Report of Proceedings - July 17, 2018

1

terms of redoing the lighting to do that.

2

So I think there does need to be some

3

kind of focus around how do we enhance or improve

4

lighting from the keyhole of the car to the

5

keyhole of the door because there are some areas

6

that are really low-level lighting because of the

7

way it is directed.

8
9

MS. DARLING:

And you're right, Alderman

Ervin and Alderman Scott, the dispersion of that

10

light is more focussed.

That's part of what the

11

LED fixture provides is a more targeted light.

12

It doesn't have that dispersion in -- for HDS it

13

throws light 360 degrees.

14

throws light up into the sky where it's not

15

needed and other places it's not needed.

16

a more directed light, but I do know that where

17

there is individual blocks, there are options to

18

deal with that.

19

closely.

20

are specific areas that you are concerned about,

21

you know, let's make sure that you are in touch

22

with CDOT and we'll make sure that those areas

23

are addressed because there are some options

24

there.

And so, you know, it

This is

And CDOT has been working very

I don't know specifically, but if there

3

ALDERMAN ERVIN:

Is the dispersion

adjustable?
MS. DARLING:

Not on the -- not on the

4

individual fixture.

5

the lighting management system, but on individual

6

areas where there may be a concern, there may be

7

options to deal with that on a kind of an

8

area-by-area basis if there is a specific

9

concern.

10

MR. BURKE:

It can't be adjusted through

Alderman, to your point this is

11

really the development environment in Chicago,

12

the pole spacing presents many challenges.

13

Particularly our tree canopy as well.

14

been out over the last months demoing some new

15

fixtures to adjust the issues you've raised and

16

they can be utilized in particular problematic

17

areas where we have those.

18

We have

And just we were out in the far west

19

side just last week and we had had a fixture and

20

we had very good results with and feedback from

21

the community.

22

you to talk about that.

23
24

So we will be following up with

ALDERMAN SCOTT:

Also, the poles that are

higher because they cast a wider net.

The higher

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

54

 Report of Proceedings - July 17, 2018

1

the fixture is, the better it is in terms of

2

light for the entire block.

3

the new poles are constructed they are a little

4

bit shorter than the poles of the past, the

5

dispersion is really narrow.

6

know what that is, but that also is a problem.

7

ALDERMAN ERVIN:

Because of the way

So, I mean, I don't

Perhaps just new fixtures

8

that has a wider dispersion or how is that being

9

addressed?

10

MR. BURKE:

Alderman, we're looking at

11

exactly as you stated, we're looking at a new

12

fixture with wider dispersion where it could use

13

-- where you have problematic cases of the

14

building environment and it has an excessive pole

15

spacing or some other particular issue or you

16

have -- most City right of way is 66 feet.

17

have cases where it's 80 feet or these other or a

18

particularly dense tree canopy or other issue

19

where, you know, we're looking at alternate

20

fixtures.

21

ALDERMAN SCOTT:

 Report of Proceedings - July 17, 2018

1

redo the entire block and do new poles which you

2

take out of a menu of the Alderman which is way

3

more than you probably would want to do.

4

So, you know, we're looking for

5

options from CDOT.

6

those heads that disperse a little bit more, cast

7

a wider net, I think it would work in areas that

Alderman Ervin and I have a lot of the same

problems in the area so.

MR. BURKE:

And I think that if we have

And then we're also piloting and

11

looking at, Aldermen, where you have, like

12

there's spots where in the built environment

13

where you have excessively large pole spaces up

14

to 180 to 190 feet, etcetera.

15

appears the only really the solution will be to

16

add an additional pole.

17

the Office of Budget Management to set up some

18

additional funding to address those situations as

19

they come up.

ALDERMAN SCOTT:

And we are working with

Okay.

May I?

On this point I am very

22

in agreement with the concerns that the Aldermen

have raised, but I do recall some very

significant resistance to having the light be

there are others who would strongly, as I recall,

object to the dispersion.

6

MS. DARLING:

So we

Because

I agree with the

Yes, of course.

So I guess

7

what I can say which I hope will be helpful is

8

that the City has specced 14 different fixtures

9

to be able to make a determination of what

10

fixture goes on what pole to provide the correct

11

dispersion for that pole height and that pole

12

location.

13

concerns by individual area and we will have

14

control over the lights and the dimming,

15

etcetera.

16

So there will be ways to address

MS. CAFARO:

And so you've wisely built that

17

possibility into this project that could be

18

somewhat customized by the wishes of the

19

constituents effectively as --

20

MS. DARLING:

We have certainly -- and CDOT

21

has been very emphatic about making sure that

they're working with the individual Aldermen and

what they need.

2 complete years into seeing savings.

3

-- each of the energy companies that we work with

give us a report at the end of the year to verify

the savings that we achieve in the previous year.

So we are now 2 years into -All of the

approval.

16

this is what it is.

17

either agrees or asks them to come back and

explain or adjust the report and that we mutually

agreed to the ultimate result of their reports.

And it's subject to City

hall.

13

And is this offset by anything else or how do you

14

all treat this?

15

Is this revenue?

MR. BUDESCU:

You may be

I'm used to a town
How is this recorded?

May I answer that?

So it's

16

considered revenue to the Chicago Infrastructure

17

Trust.

18

the project was originally structured is the CIT

19

entered into a number of contracts.

20

City that contracted with the energy services

21

companies to perform the energy conservation

22

measures, but the CIT entered into those

23

construction contracts and separately entered

24

into an agreement with the City called an Energy

And the reason for that is the way that

It's not the

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

67

 Report of Proceedings - July 17, 2018

68

1

Services Agreement where the City pays an amount

2

that reflects the savings to the CIT only in such

3

case where the savings are approved.

4

So it's not revenue to the City

5

because it's really a budget saving there to your

6

point because this is kind of a nuance view.

7

the payments from the City to the CIT on the

8

Energy Services Agreement are recorded as revenue

9

for us, but they are -- they are only to be used

10

for the purpose of paying back the debt that was

11

borrowed by the CIT in order to finance the

12

construction projects.

13

ALDERMAN ERVIN:

But

As I recall, the debt of

14

the -- the borrowing is not on the City's books,

15

but it's on your books, on these books here?

16

MR. BUDESCU:

That's right.

17

ALDERMAN ERVIN:

And any -- so the City is

18

paying you on a flat rate then, anything you save

19

above and beyond it is revenue to the CIT.

20

MS. DARLING:

No, actually we are working

21

with the City currently because there are some

22

excess savings.

23

excess to the loan principal which is actually

24

going to shorten the loan repayment.

We are working to apply that

It doesn't

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 Report of Proceedings - July 17, 2018

1

come to us at all.

2

working with the City currently to apply it to

3

the principal to shorten the loan time.

4

MR. BUDESCU:

It's anything extra we are

And then once the loan is

5

retired, all the savings are accrued to the City.

6

So those excess savings that are being aggregated

7

now and applied to the principal really mean that

8

the City then gets to accrue all the savings

9

related to those energy conservation measures at

10

an earlier date.

11

MS. CAFARO:

12

So may I restate in a different

way and make sure that I understand?

13

MR. BUDESCU:

14

MS. CAFARO:

Absolutely.
So basically there is a payback

15

period for the investment.

16

being applied to pay that down including the

17

excess.

begin to accrue because the payback period is

19

over.

per anum or so will accrue to be a budget savings

for the City.

These saving are

Once that's done all the savings will

talking about.

20

And as many of you know that our state

So when I use that, that's the acronym I'm

So that bill has really changed the

21

landscape of the attractiveness of solar for the

22

State of Illinois.

23

renewable energy credit crisis and really

24

incentivizes solar.

It provides very favorable

So we have been working with

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

73

 Report of Proceedings - July 17, 2018

1

the City to figure out how we can highlight the

2

commitment of the City to move to renewable

3

energy and also show the viability of solar

4

projects both for economic development and job

5

creation in the City of Chicago.

6

So we are working with the City on

7

developing an RFP that's in process.

I don't

8

have a date for release, but we are working very

9

closely with the Chief Sustainability Officer and

10

with the Department of Fleet and Facility

11

Management on developing an RFP that we estimate

12

will be a design, build, finance, operate and

13

maintain model to develop a solar photovoltaic

14

system primarily ground based.

15

at utilizing underutilized City land that is

16

currently vacant.

17

ALDERMAN SCOTT:

And we're looking

Is there a requirement on

18

how much land it has to be before it becomes

19

profitable because, I mean, I got a ton of land,

20

but I don't have contiguous.

21
22

MS. DARLING:

I don't have --

Well, we are working with --

I hear you.

23

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

24

MS. DARLING:

I saw that coming.

We are working with the

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

74

 Report of Proceedings - July 17, 2018

1

Department of Planning and Development to figure

2

out where there are plans for specific vacant

3

properties in the City.

4

leases because this is a big investment that the

5

developers would have to make to put these solar

6

installations on the land.

7

sure that they can stay there for a long time.

8

So if there is plans for properties for other

9

development, that would not be a good use of land

10
11

These would be long-term

So we want to make

for a solar development.
CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

To your point though

12

whether it has to be contiguous, I think that's

13

really up to the operator to be able to sort of

14

make noncontiguous parcels sort of the

15

financially viable.

16

ALDERMAN SCOTT:

17

MS. DOWNEY:

18

Right, that's what I was --

We're only really looking at

sites around 2 acres or more.

19

ALDERMAN SCOTT:

20

MS. DARLING:

Okay.

But we are, you know,

21

currently working in close collaboration with the

22

City.

23

expect that this first project may be a huge

24

amount of land, we want to get it started.

And what we're hoping is while we don't

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

And

75

 Report of Proceedings - July 17, 2018

76

1

we want to start engaging some developers.

2

we also are going to put this RFP out to see what

3

the market will bear in the City of Chicago.

4

we think that the timing is really right based on

5

the incentives that exist with FEJA and so we're

6

going to see what the developers propose.

7

And

And

And so we'll keep you updated on that.

8

And unfortunately I don't have too much more

9

information to share at this time because we are

10

still in development on this project, but we are

11

in the drafting mode.

12

and we're very excited to be working with the

13

City on this.

14

So it's really happening

Alderman Villegas.

ALDERMAN VILLEGAS:

Is it essentially this

15

is just going to be from the FEJA aspect or are

16

you thinking about the City incentives related

17

around subsidizing the land or selling it to the

18

developer or --

19

MS. DARLING:

I think that the fact that

20

it's vacant land we would be able to provide a

21

very favorable rate to the developer, but that's

22

not firmly decided yet.

23
24

MS. DOWNEY:

There are also some incentives

through FEJA that they can kind of access because
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 Report of Proceedings - July 17, 2018

77

1

of working with the City.

2

of the City so they wouldn't -- like so

3

nonprofits and stuff like that there are like

4

favorable rent prices to do with that that they

5

will also have extra access to just because they

6

do it through a City.

7

MS. DARLING:

Like working on behalf

And also in FEJA there is the

8

Solar For All which is the community solar.

So

9

there may be an opportunity that the developer

10

will wish to do community solar which will allow

11

certain communities to be able to get reduced

12

rates of electricity from being a subscriber to

13

the solar system.

14

MR. BUDESCU:

And I think and part of this

15

is still being worked out in exactly what the

16

market structure makes sense, but at the end of

17

the day it's not just the City leasing the land

18

and they're operating the solar parcel there, but

19

the City would buy back the energy and they --

20

ideally it's at a cost that may even be below

21

what the City pays for energy today if you can

22

structure it in a way that really takes in the

23

most favorable renewable energy credit.

24

But back to the point of if you're
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 Report of Proceedings - July 17, 2018

1

sort of charging a high lease, that gets built in

2

so it's sort of like one pocket or the other.

3

And we're still working through how to structure

4

it in the most favorable way to the City and

5

whether it's a slightly lower cost of kilowatt

6

per hour or a certain amount of energy over a

7

certain amount of years or is it a higher rent

8

payment on a long-term lease or something like

9

that.

10

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

You think these will be

11

conditioned on an off-take area or something like

12

that?

13

see that?

14

Like in order to get done they'll need to

MR. BUDESCU:

Yes, I think that's likely

15

that there would be some sort of power purchase

16

agreement or something similar to it.

17

necessarily for 100 percent.

18

MS. DOWNEY:

Not

As well as part of if they do

19

use the FEJA incentives especially around

20

community solar, the kind of anchor tenant can't

21

buy more than 40 percent of the power so the City

22

will likely not buy more than --

23

MR. SILVERS:

Leslie.

24

MS. DARLING:

Yes, Damon.

 Report of Proceedings - July 17, 2018

1

MR. SILVERS:

Hi.

I just wanted to chime in

2

here on this in general.

I think that this is

3

exactly the sort of thing and I appreciate the

4

way in which you've described it as something

5

where you want to get in the game.

6

a really good project for the Trust.

7

has a number of aspects to it that all kind of

8

come together in good ways.

9

the utilization of vacant land.

That this is
I think it

And so I -- both of
Obviously the

10

commitment to renewables.

11

installation -- solar installations and

12

operations are in this way, at this scale are a

13

source of good jobs and for skilled workers and

14

apprenticeship programs that can be integrated

15

with it if we do it at scale.

16

The fact that solar

And also the fact that, you know,

17

ultimately, you know, it's part of the electrical

18

grid.

19

some of the sort of challenges around operations

20

that exist with some of the things we do aren't

21

really there.

22

want to do business with, all the types of

23

entities that operate these kinds of things.

24

It's a good -- it's a really good asset category

It's a space in which there, you know,

The -- the types of entities we

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services

79

 Report of Proceedings - July 17, 2018

1

for us to be in.

2

encourage it.

3

MS. DARLING:

And so I just wanted to

Thank you, Damon.

You brought

4

up some of the points that I was going to

5

conclude with about economic development and job

6

creation especially around green jobs.

7

appreciate you bringing that up.

8
9

So I

I know some people have some time
commitments and have to leave.

So, again, I want

10

to welcome Alderman Ervin to the Board and

11

Alderman Villegas to the Advisory Board.

12

you both for being here and participating today.

13

And also thanks again to Alderman O'Shea for your

14

service.

15

we will see you again soon.

16
17

20

Thank

We will miss you very much and I know

If there are no other questions or is
there anything else, Mr. Chairman?
CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

I don't think so.

No one

was registered for public comment, right?
MS. DARLING:

Yes, we will have time for

21

public comment, but also before we just -- no one

22

is registered for public comment.

23

don't need executive session.

24

Okay.

And we

So I just before we close I just want
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services

80

 Report of Proceedings - July 17, 2018

1

to thank the hardest working team around.

2

3

work they have put in to making these projects

4

successful.

5

and we accomplish a lot.

6

thank you all for continuing to support and

7

participate in our organization and we couldn't

8

do it without all of you.
