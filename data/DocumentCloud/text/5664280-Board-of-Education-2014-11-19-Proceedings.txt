AMEND BOARD REPORT 
AMEND BOARD REPORT 
ADOPT A SCHOOL QUALITY RATING POLICY

THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER RECOMMENDS:
That the Chicago Board of Education adopt a School Quality Rating Policy.

POLICY TEXT:
I. Purpose and Goals

This policy shall establish the standards and criteria for issuing a School Quality Rating and
Accountability Status to each school that is either Good Standing status, Remediation status (which
indicates the need for Provisional Support) or Probation status (which indicates the need for Intensive
Support) per Section 5134-83 of the illinois School Code. This policy will take effect beginning with a
School Quality Rating and Accountability Status issued to each school for the 2014-2015 school year
based on School performance data gathered during the prior school year. This policy wilt also apply to
subsequent school years unless amended or rescinded by the Board. A school?s Accountability Status
from the prior school year shall remain in effect until such time as the school is noti?ed of its new status
for the then-current school year that is issued in accordance with this policy.

This policy sets out a systematic means for measuring a school's performance and identifying schools in
need of support and increased oversight due to insuf?cient levels of achievement and growth based on
the key indicators and School Quality Rating system as de?ned by the Board herein. Section 5134-83 of
the Illinois School Code provides for the remediation and probation of schools and requires the Chief
Executive Of?cer of the Chicago Public Schools to munitor the performance of each
school using the criteria and rating system established by the Board to identify those schoois in which: 
there is a faiiure to develop, implement, or comply with the school improvement plan; (2) there is a
pervasive breakdown in the educational program as indicated by various factors such as the absence of
improvement in reading and math achievement scores, an increased drop-out rate, a decreased
graduation rate, or a decrease in the rate of student attendance; or (3) there is a failure or refusal to
comply with the provisions of the School Code, other applicable laws, collective bargaining agreements,
court orders, or with applicable Board rules and policies.

The Board recognizes that an effective and fair School Quality Rating system considers a broad range of
indicators of success, including, but not limited to student test score performance and student academic
growth, closing of achievement gaps, school culture and climate, attendance, graduation, and preparation
for post-grad uation success. Therefore, this policy establishes a comprehensive system to assess school
performance in order to identify, monitor and assist schools with low student performance in these areas,
as well as provide a framework for action to intervene in schools with stagnant or insuf?cient rates of
student improvement. The School Quality Rating system also provides a means for recognition of schools
who have demonstrated distinguished levels of performance.

II. Scope of the Policy

All CPS schools are subject to this policy, including, but not limited to, neighborhood schools, magnet
schools, selective enrollment schools, contract schools, Option Schools, and schools with non-traditional
grade structures. CPS charter schoois are subject to the performance standards set out in this policy by
and through the accountability provisions in their charter contract with the Board and shall annually
receive a School Quality Rating and Status.

tit. ACCOUNTABILITY INDICATORS, STANDARDS AND SCORING
A. Accountability Status Determination

A school shatl receive a School Quality Rating and Accountability Status based upon its level of
performance and growth. The school's School Quality Rating is determined based on a point system. A
school is evaluated on each of the indicators identi?ed in Sections "1.8 through and receives points
ranging from 1 to 5 on each indicator as speci?ed. The points for each indicator are then weighted as
described in Section below and averaged to determine the schodl? 3 overall weighted score, which will
also range from 1 to 5 The schooi?s overall weighted score is used to determine the schools School
Quality Rating of either Level Level 1 Level 2+ Level 2. or Level 3 
5 as described in Section below.

The level tier rating issued to a school is then used in combination with other factors to determine whether
the school is identi?ed with an Accountability Status of Good Standing, Remediation or Probation, as
follows:

1. Schools newly established by the Board shall receive an annual School Quality Rating as soon as
suf?cient data is available, but will remain in Good Standing status until completing the second
year of operation or until such time as adequate measures of student achievement become
available.

2. A school with a School Quality Rating of Level 3 Tier?5 hereunder shall receive Probation status.

18

November 19, 2014

3. A school with a School Quality Rating of Level 2 Tier?4 hereunder shall receive Remediation
status, except when:

i. The school has been on Probation status for 2 or more consecutive years in which case
the school must receive a Level Level 1. Level or Level 2 
inept rating for 2 consecutive years to be eligible for another Accountability Status and
removal from Probation;

ii. The Board has taken an action under 105 ILCS or (4) at the school, in
which case the school must remain on Probation for a minimum of 5 years or until the
school has made Adequate Yearly Progress for 2 consecutive years, whichever occurs
later; or

The CEO has determined that the school faces academic problems that may not be
sufficiently addressed through the Remediation process, in which case the school will
receive Probation status. In making this determination, the CEO will consider various
factors including the length of time the school has had a Level 2 Item rating status, long-
tenn academic trends, school culture and climate, and quality of school leadership.

4. A school with a School Quality Rating of Level Level 1, or LeVel 2+ iieir??i??l'ieF?Z?eiiliiees
hereunder shall receive Good Standing status except when:

i. The school has been on Probation status for 2 or more consecutive years, in which case
the school must receive a Level 1+ Level 1, Level 2+ or Level 2 IieHTIFleeQTSFier?S?er
Tier-4 rating for 2 consecutive years to be eligible for another Accountability Status and
removal from Probation;

ii. The school has been on Remediation status for 2 or more consecutive years, in which
case the school must receive a Level Level 1 or Level 2+ 
rating for 2 consecutive years to be eligible for another Accountability Status and removal
from Remediation;

The school has been on a combination of Remediation and Probation status for the last 2
consecutive years, in which case the school will receive Remediation status and must
receive a Level 1+ Level 1 or Level 2+ rating for 2 consecutive
years to be eligible for another Accountability Status and removal from Remediation; or

iv. The Board has taken an action under 105 ILCS or at the school, in
which case the school must remain on Probation for a minimum of 5 years or until the
school has made Adequate Yearly Progress for 2 consecutive years, whichever occurs
later.

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the CEO may at any time place any school on Probation status if the CEO
determines that sfhe must take necessary steps to satisfy legal requirements or other mandates,
including, but not limited to, when the CEO determines: that a school has failed 'or refused to comply
with the provisions of the School Code, other applicable laws, collective bargaining agreements, court
orders, or with applicable Board rules and policies; or that a school with state or federal school
improvement status has a school improvement plan, budget or any amendment thereto that may
compromise, limit or otherwise impair the implementation of the remedial measures required by or
NCLB. Nothing herein shall limit the Board's ability to take action in accordance with 105 ILCS 5134-836).

4. Weighting for Schools Serving both High School and Elementary School Grade Levels

Schools serving both elementary and high school grades will receive separate weighted scores and
School Quality Ratings for their elementary program and their high school program. However, the
school's overall School Quality Rating and Accountability Status is determined by combining the weighted
scores from the school?s elementary and the high school programs. and further weighting the combined
score by the preportion of students in each program.

F. Assignment of a School Quality Rating

Each school will be assigned a School Quality Rating based on either its number of weighted points
earned or its National School Attainment Percentile. as de?ned in the table below. If a school quali?es for
one rating based on its number of weighted points and another rating based on its National School
Attainment Percentile, the school will be granted the highest of the two ratings as its School Quality
Rating. For elementary schools, the National School Attainment Percentile is based on NWEA Reading
and Mathematics assessments in Grades 3-8 or in Grade 2 if the school?s highest grade served is Grade
2. An elementary school must meet the National School Attainment Percentile minimum in both Reading
and Mathematics to qualify for a School Quality Rating based on attainment percentile. For high schools,
the National School Attainment Percentile is based on the EXPLORE, PLAN, and ACT assessments. A
high school must meet the National School Attainment Percentile minimum based on its composite score
for EXPLORE, PLAN, and ACT to qualify for a School Quality Rating based on attainment percentile. For
a school to earn a School Quality Rating based on the attainment percentile rather than weighted points
earned, the school must have a minimum 95% participation rate on all assessments that determine the
sChool?s attainment percentile.

- Level 2 Tier-4 Between 2.0 and 2.9 40??
Level 3 Tier?5 Less than 2.0 

 

 

 

22

November 19, 2014

For schools serving both elementary and high school grades, the school receives weighted scores and
ratings for the elementary and high school programs separately, which are then combined into a single
overall School Quality Rating as described in Section lil.E.4. If either the elementary and/or high school
program achieves a higher program rating based on their Minimum Attainment Percentile than their
weighted points earned, that program will receive the higher le_ve'_l tier rating. When combining both
prOQram scores into a single overall School Quality Rating, any program rating based on Minimum
Attainment Percentile shall be converted into the lowest score associated with that l?y_e_i tier for purposes
of performing the weighted calculation as described in Section Ill.E.4. The lowest score associated with
each ley_e_ltiei= are as follows: Level 1+ 4 points. Level 1 3.5 points. Level 2+ 3 points. Level 2 2

points 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, it a District?operated school with a Level 1+ or Level 1 rating experienced
conditions or an event that had a signi?cant impact on the school. the school may receive a School
Quality Rating of Level 1. ln makinq this determination. the CEO will consider the following factors: 1) a

signi?cant change in student population, exclusive of students in new or entail?level grades; (2) a

signi?cant change of the school?s teaching staff as compared to the prior year; (3) a change of principal,-
(4) a signi?cant change in the school?s academic program; or [St any other event that had a signi?cant

impact. Such a CEO determination shalt not be applied in consecutive years.

 

In the event the CEO determines that the performance indicators speci?ed in this policy are not
appropriate for measuring a school?s performance, the CEO may recommend to the Board the use of
other speci?ed performance indicators to evaluate the school and issue its School Quality Rating and
Accountability Status. The CEO shall use such alternate performance indicators when approved by th
Board. -

IV. SCHOOLS IDENTIFIED AS NEEDING REMEDIAL ASSISTANCE

On a date to be determined by the CEO or his designee, after school performance data is available,
schools will be noti?ed as to their Accountability Status hereunder.

improvement plan and a school budget for correcting de?ciencies identi?ed by the Board. The CEO or
designee shall develop a school improvement plan (currently known as the CIWP) that shall contain
speci?c steps that the local school council and the school staff must take to correct identi?ed de?ciencies.
The school?s CIWP may serve as the school?s Probation plan. The school budget shall include speci?c
expenditures that support the implementation of this plan and that are directly calculated to correct
educational and operational de?ciencies identi?ed at the school.

In creating or updating the required plan, the CEO or designee shall give assistance to Probation schools
to ensure that all aspects of the plan, including the school budget. re?ect and are tailored to the individual
needs of the school and that the plan addresses the educational deficiencies at these schools. For
