PROJECTS
Queen Lillian II Brownfield Redevelopment Plan: Plan Duration Requirements
Extension Request
Mr. Vosburg presented the extension request for the Queen Lillian II Brownfield
Redevelopment Plan and responded to Board Member questions regarding any future
requests for plan duration extensions.

 The Queen Lillian II Brownfield Redevelopment Plan (the “Plan”) was approved by the
DBRA Board of Directors on April 9, 2014 and by Detroit City Council (the “Council”) on
June 10, 2014. The Reimbursement Agreement was executed on September 15, 2014.
On April 6, 2016 the DBRA approved a 120-day extension for Work Plan submission and
a 1-year extension to complete eligible activities.
Queen Lillian II, LLC is the developer (the “Developer”) for Plan which is located at 3439
- 3455 Woodward at the corner of Stimson. Due to delays with underwriting the complex
financing at the Michigan Economic Development Corporation (“MEDC”) and the
Michigan Strategic Fund (“MSF”) beyond the control of the Developer, the Developer was
not able to submit the Work Plan within eighty (120) days of the DBRA extension and
similarly will not likely complete eligible activities within the allotted extension. MEDC staff
have indicated that completion of underwriting and Work Plan submission will be able to
occur soon, however they have not given a firm date as to when this will happen.
As such, the Developers are requesting 1) a one (1) year extension from the date of the
attached resolution receive work plan approval by the Michigan Strategic Fund and the
Michigan Department of Environmental Quality and 2) a one (1) year extension from the
extended completion date of June 11, 2018 to complete all eligible activities.
DBRA staff recommended the approval of the second extension.
A resolution granting the second extension of the Queen Lillian II Brownfield
Redevelopment Plan duration requirements was attached for Board review and approval.
Ms. DeSantis called for a motion approving the Queen Lillian II Brownfield
Redevelopment plan duration requirements extension. The Board took the following
action:
On a motion by Ms. McClain, seconded by Ms. Wilkins, DBRA Resolution Code
16-09-228-05 was unanimously approved.
ADMINISTRATIVE
Local Site Remediation Revolving Fund Guidelines
Ms. Kanalos presented the Local Site Remediation Revolving Fund Guidelines and
responded to Board Member questions regarding how the specifics of the fund and its
potential benefit to developers.
Section 8 of the Michigan Public Act 381 of 1996, as amended (“Act 381”) allows
Brownfield Redevelopment Authorities (“BRAs”) to establish a Local Site Remediation
Revolving Fund (“LSRRF”). Utilizing a LSRRF, BRAs may collect up to an additional 5
years of Tax Increment Revenue (“TIR”) after the Developer is fully reimbursed for their
Eligible Costs. Since the inception of the City of Detroit Brownfield Redevelopment
Authority (“DBRA”), all DBRA approved brownfield plans have contemplated this
additional 5 years of capture for deposit into a LSRRF. Per Act 381, the LSRRF can be

 used to “pay the costs of eligible activities on eligible property that is located within a
municipality.”
The DBRA is ready to establish its LSRRF and as such, guidelines have been drafted for
the implementation of the fund. Key highlights of the guidelines include:









The LSRRF is to be used to provide revolving loans to eligible entities to support
Brownfield redevelopment in Detroit.
The loan amount shall not exceed 50% of the DBRA’s Tax Increment Financing
(“TIF”) commitment to a project with a minimum amount of $25,000.00 and a
maximum loan amount of $300,000.00.
TIF capture from the project shall be pledged to DBRA as security for loan
repayment for each LSRRF loan. Additional security may also be required by the
DBRA, including, but not limited to, personal guaranties and mortgage liens on
eligible property.
Interest rates and repayment terms on LSRFF loans will be market competitive
based on loan underwriting and project needs.
The principal portion of the loan repayments will be deposited into the LSRRF,
providing a sustainable source of capital within the community and payments of
interest received by DBRA in connection with LSRRF loans shall be used by DBRA
to fund LSRRF operating costs.
All loans would be subject to DBRA Board approval.

The Board requested that at least one (1) Board Member be appointed to review the
loans. Board Members inquired as to the feasibility of the Budget Committee, the
subsequent item on the agenda, to review the loans but it was determined that the
proposed Budget Committee would be to review just the DBRA Budget. Staff informed
the Board that it would consult with legal counsel on the formation of a Loan Review
Committee. The Board requested that the resolution reflect the formation of a Loan
Review Committee.
Attached for Board review and approval were the proposed LSRRF Guidelines and a
resolution approving the LSRRF Guidelines.
Ms. DeSantis called for a motion approving the Local Site Remediation Revolving Fund
Guidelines. The Board took the following action:
On a motion by Ms. Grillier, seconded by Ms. Wilkins, DBRA Resolution Code 1609-01-170, as amended, was unanimously approved.

Chair of the Committee.

DBRA budget amendments as requested by the Board Chair, a quorum of the DBRA
Board of Directors or as requested by the DBRA Authorized Agent.
4. The review of a proposed budget by the Committee shall be advisory only. Only a
quorum of the full DBRA Board of Directors at a scheduled Board of Directors meeting
may approve a DBRA budget or any potential budget amendments.
5. Committee members shall be appointed to the Committee to serve by a vote of a
quorum of the DBRA Board of Directors.
Attached for Board review and approval was a resolution approving the creation of the
DBRA Budget Committee.
Ms. DeSantis called for a motion approving the formation of the DBRA Budget Committee.
