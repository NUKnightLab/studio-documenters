GENERAL
Approval of Minutes:
Mr. Walters called for a motion approving the minutes of April 25, 2018 as presented.
The Board took the following action:
On a motion by Mr. Scott, seconded by Ms. McClain, DBRA Resolution Code 1805-02-233 was unanimously approved.
PROJECTS
Amended and Restated Brownfield Plan for the Former Free Press Building 321 W.
Lafayette Redevelopment Project
Mr. Vosburg presented the Amended and Restated Brownfield Plan for the Former Free
Press Building 321 W. Lafayette Redevelopment Project.
On July 29, 2010, the City Council of the City of Detroit (“City Council”) approved the
Brownfield Plan for the Free Press Redevelopment Project (the “Original Plan”). As you
may recall, the City of Detroit Brownfield Redevelopment Authority (“DBRA”) Board of
Directors (“Board”) previously approved a recommendation to City Council to: (i)
terminate the Original Plan in accordance with Act 381; and (ii) approve a new brownfield
plan for the Former Free Press Building. Due to changes in the Michigan Economic
Development Corporation (MEDC) policy related to Michigan Business Tax (MBT) Credits
that occurred after the aforementioned Board recommendations, DBRA was advised that
in order to preserve the MBT Credit for this project, the Original Plan could not be
terminated. As a result, instead of terminating the Original Plan and approving a new
Brownfield Plan, DBRA staff is now seeking the Board’s approval to begin the process to
amend and restate the Original Plan with the attached Plan which will allow the Developer
(as defined below) to preserve the MBT Credit and include additional eligible activities.
The Plan described is largely the same project previously presented to the Board in April
of 2017.

 Project Introduction
Pyramid Development Co., LLC, a Bedrock Detroit affiliate, is the project developer (the
“Developer”) for the Plan which entails the rehabilitation of the 276,183 square foot former
Detroit Free Press building into a mixed-use building with retail on the first floor, office on
the second and third floors, and residential on floors 4-17 and an undetermined use for
the basement and sub-basement. First through third floor tenants have not been
determined at this time.
It is estimated that approximately 196 temporary construction jobs will be created and
approximately 10 direct permanent jobs will be created in connection with the
redevelopment. Additional permanent jobs are expected to be created by the retail and
office tenants. The Developer has agreed to comply with City Executive Orders 2016-1
and 2014-4.
Total investment is expected to be approximately $69,663,000.00. The Developers are
requesting $7,989,347.00 in TIF reimbursement under the proposed Plan.
As mentioned previously, a Brownfield Plan, an Act 381 Work Plan, and a Large
Brownfield MBT Credit, titled “Detroit Free Press House” and “Free Press Plaza and
Apartments” were approved for the Eligible Property in 2010. The Developer is requesting
the amendment and restatement of the “Detroit Free Press House” Brownfield Plan,
approved in 2010. The Brownfield Plan, Act 381 Work Plan, and the Brownfield MBT
Credit (the “Credit”) will be amended and restated to modify the following: legal
descriptions, scope of Project, Eligible Activities, and Eligible Investment that was
included in the original approvals.
Property Subject to the Plan
The eligible property (the “Property”) consists of a single (1) parcel containing only the
Free Press Building located at 321 West Lafayette Boulevard on the west side of
downtown Detroit.
Basis of Eligibility
The property is considered “eligible property” as defined by Act 381, Section 2 because
(a) the property was previously utilized or is currently utilized for a commercial purpose;
(b) it is located within the City of Detroit, a qualified local governmental unit under Act
381; and (c) the Property is determined to be Functionally Obsolete.
Eligible Activities and Projected Costs
The “eligible activities” that are intended to be carried out at the Property are considered
“eligible activities” as defined by Sec 2 of Act 381, because they include site demolition,
selective building demolition, lead & asbestos surveying, asbestos abatement, air
monitoring, hazardous material removal, site preparation, and preparation of a brownfield
plan and work plan. The eligible activities and budgeted costs are intended as part of the
development of the Property and will be financed solely by the Developer. The Authority
is not responsible for any costs of eligible activities and will incur no debt. The eligible

 activities began in the third quarter of 2017 and are estimated to be complete no later
than March 2021. Based on the existing Credit, the Project must be completed and
receive a temporary certificate of occupancy by March 8th, 2021 in order to receive the
Credit.
Tax Increment Financing (TIF) Capture
The Developer desires to be reimbursed for the costs of eligible activities. Tax increment
revenue generated by the Property will be captured by the DBRA and used to reimburse
the cost of the eligible activities completed on the Property after approval of this Plan
pursuant to the terms of a Reimbursement Agreement with the DBRA.

2. Selective Building Demolition

10. State Brownfield Redevelopment Fund
$1,010,369.00

TOTAL Estimated Costs $11,056,469.00
The actual cost of those eligible activities encompassed by this Plan that will qualify for
reimbursement from tax increment revenues of the DBRA from the Property shall be
governed by the terms of the Reimbursement Agreement.
Other Development Incentives
The Developers of this Plan will seek additional support through the transfer of the existing
Michigan Business Tax Credit for the property as well as a Neighborhood Enterprise Zone
Abatement (PA 147). In addition, the Developer also anticipates a Commercial
Rehabilitation (PA 210) tax abatement to be approved for the eligible property.
DBRA-CAC Letter of Recommendation
The DBRA-CAC recommended approval of the Plan at the April 25, 2018 CAC meeting.
Attached was the DBRA-CAC’s letter of recommendation for the DBRA Board’s
consideration.
Public Comments
Attached were the results of the DBRA public hearing for the Plan that was held on
Monday, May 7, 2018 at the Detroit Economic Growth Corporation’s offices located at
500 Griswold Street, Suite 2200 Detroit, Michigan 48226.

 Ms. DeSantis asked about the change in total estimated costs from the Brownfield Plan
as previously approved.
Attached for Board review and approval was a resolution approving the Brownfield Plan
for the Amended and Restated Brownfield Plan for the Former Free Press Building 321
W. Lafayette Redevelopment Project and its submittal to Detroit City Council.
Mr. Walters called for a motion approving the submittal of the Amended and Restated
Former Free Press Building Brownfield Redevelopment Plan to the Detroit City Council.
The Board took the following action:
On a motion by Ms. Wilkins, seconded by Ms. DeSantis, DBRA Resolution Code
18-05-191-06 was unanimously approved.
Queen Lillian II Brownfield Redevelopment Plan Extension of Eligible Activities
Mr. Vosburg presented the background on the project to date as well as an overview of
the proposed Extension of Duration of Plan Requirements for the Queen Lillian II
Brownfield Redevelopment Plan.
The Queen Lillian II Brownfield Redevelopment Plan (the “Plan”) was approved by the
DBRA Board of Directors on April 9, 2014 and by Detroit City Council (the “Council”) on
June 10, 2014. The Reimbursement Agreement was executed on September 15, 2014.
On April 6, 2016 the DBRA approved a 120-day extension for Work Plan submission and
a 1-year extension to complete eligible activities. On September 28, 2016 the DBRA
approved a 1-year extension for Work Plan submission and a 1-year extension to
complete eligible activities.
Queen Lillian II, LLC is the developer (the “Developer”) for Plan which is located at 3439
- 3455 Woodward at the corner of Stimson. Due to delays with underwriting the complex
financing at the Michigan Economic Development Corporation (“MEDC”) and the
Michigan Strategic Fund (“MSF”), as well as rapidly changing real estate finance markets,
the Developer was not able to submit the Work Plan within one hundred twenty (120)
days of the DBRA extension and similarly will not likely complete eligible activities within
the allotted extension.
As such, the Developers requested 1) a one (1) year extension from the date of the
attached resolution receive work plan approval by the Michigan Strategic Fund and the
Michigan Department of Environmental Quality and 2) a three (3) year extension from the
extended completion date of June 11, 2018 to complete all eligible activities.
DBRA staff recommended the approval of the third extension.
A resolution granting the THIRD extension of the Queen Lillian II Brownfield
Redevelopment Plan duration requirements was attached for Board review and approval.

 Ms. Washington asked what the anticipated extension timeline is. Mr. Jackson advised
that a three (3) year extension is sufficient.
Ms. DeSantis asked if the development is still going to include affordable housing units.
Mr. Jackson stated that 10% of the housing units will be provided at 50-60% of the area
median income.
Ms. DeSantis asked who the developer’s new equity partner is. Mr. Jackson stated that
Platform is the new equity partner, and advised that Queen Lillian II will remain the
controlling owner of the development.
Ms. McClain asked what the ratio of the uses will be in the development. Mr. Jenkins
provided the retail and housing square footage and the potential tenants.
Mr. Walters asked about the anticipated timeline for construction. Mr. Jackson stated that
construction will begin at the end of summer of 2018.
Mr. Jackson made brief remarks as developer of the project and answered various
questions board members presented.
Mr. Walters called for a motion approving the Extension of Duration of Plan Requirements
for the Queen Lillian II Brownfield Redevelopment Plan.
