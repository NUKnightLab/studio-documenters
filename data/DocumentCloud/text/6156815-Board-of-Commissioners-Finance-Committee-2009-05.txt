STATE’S ATTORNEY, Anita Alvarez, submitting communication advising the
County of the Agreed Order Appointing a Transitional Administrator regarding
Jimmy Doe v. County of Cook, USDC No. 99-C-3945. This class action litigation
was originally brought in 1999 and has subsequently involved the entry of a
Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between the parties that was approved by the
District Court in December 2002 and the entry of an Agreed Supplemental Order
approved by the Court on May 18, 2006. This petition was resolved by the entry of
an Agreed Order Appointing a Transitional Administrator (TA) by the District Court
on August 14, 2007. The Board of Commissioners agreed to the entry of the

On June 18, 2008, the District Court entered an order amending this portion of the
TA Order permitting the Transitional Administrator to maintain the OTA funds in a

The OTA account was first funded at $800,000.00 on July 22, 2008 and the District
Court entered an order for additional funds of $500,000.00 on December 18, 2008.
The Transitional Administrator has now presented invoice payment records

an order providing for an additional disbursement of $500,000.00 into the OTA
account which was approved by the Court on April 18, 2009.
Upon approval, the Cook County Comptroller will transfer $500,000.00 from the
