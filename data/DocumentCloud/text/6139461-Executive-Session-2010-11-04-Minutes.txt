Executive Session pursuant to Section 2(c)(7) of the Open Meetings Act, 5 ILCS 120, to discuss
matters related to an investment contract.
Roll Call Vote:

NAYS: None
Vote Result: MOTION ADOPTED
Trustee Kilgallon summarized the reasons for embarking on the consultant search and the
process that staff and Trustees went through to date. He stated that the Board could choose to
defer the matter or make a decision based on the search process. He stated that if a new
consultant were chosen, the transition could be January 1 which is a natural end to the existing
contract. He explained that the item for the vote was not listed on the agenda as a separate item
and the Board has been advised by legal counsel that if they act they may have to ratify the
matter in the future.
Ms. Hackett summarized the search process and the findings of staff. The Trustees discussed the
terms of the current investment consultant contract and of the various proposals. They discussed
the client references of the finalist firms and the differences between and amongst the finalists
and our existing consultant. They discussed the impact, if any, of deferring a vote on the
transition. They discussed calling a special meeting as soon as possible in order to get the item
properly place on the agenda and get any necessary transition underway.
It was moved by Trustee Benjamin and seconded by Trustee Granberry that, no action having
been taken, the Executive Session be adjourned and that the Board return to open session.
Vote Result: MOTION ADOPTED UNANIMOUSLY BY VOICE VOTE.

 Ms. Burns addressed the Board. She reminded the Trustees that the Fund is involved in litigation
in the Circuit Court of Cook County with Mr. Michno with regard to a claim for disability
benefits and that he was trying to obtain duty disability benefits without having gone to the Cook
County Workers’ Compensation Commission. The Court ordered that Mr. Michno be given a
hearing on the matter and Fund did so. The Hearing Officer issued a Recommended Opinion
and the Fund filed a Statement of Exceptions. Ms. Burns explained that the Board should
consider all filings submitted. She further explained that the Board makes the final decision on
the matter and has the option to accept or reject the Recommended Opinion or to reopen and
remand the matter in order to address any issues that may remain outstanding, including having
an independent medical examiner examine Mr. Michno.
It was moved by Trustee Fitzgerald and seconded by Trustee Benjamin that, no action having
been taken, the Executive Session be adjourned and that the Board return to open session.
Vote Result: MOTION ADOPTED UNANIMOUSLY BY VOICE VOTE.
