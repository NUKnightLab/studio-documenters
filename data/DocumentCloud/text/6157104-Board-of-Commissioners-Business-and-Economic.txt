Classification 6b that provides an applicant a reduction in the assessment level for an abandoned industrial

WHEREAS, the Cook County Classification System for Assessment defines abandoned property as buildings
and other structures that, after having been vacant and unused for at least 24 continuous months, have been
purchased for value by a purchaser in whom the seller has no direct financial interest; and
WHEREAS, in the instance where the property does not meet the definition of abandoned property, the
municipality or the Board of Commissioners, may determine that special circumstances may exist that justify
finding that the property is abandoned for purpose of Class 6b; and
WHEREAS, in the case of abandonment of less than 24 months and purchase for value, by a purchaser in
whom the seller has no direct financial interest, the County may determine that special circumstances justify
finding the property is deemed abandoned; and
WHEREAS, Class 6b requires the validation by the County Board of the shortened period of qualifying
abandonment in cases where the facility has been abandoned for less than 24 consecutive months upon purchase
for value; and
WHEREAS, the municipality states the Class 6b is necessary for development to occur on this specific real
estate. The municipal resolution cites the qualifications of this property to meet the definition of abandoned with
special circumstances; and
WHEREAS, industrial real estate is normally assessed at 25% of its market value, qualifying industrial real
estate eligible for the Class 6b can receive a significant reduction in the level of assessment from the date that new
construction or rehabilitation has been completed, or in the case of abandoned property from
the
date
of
substantial re-occupancy. Properties receiving Class 6b will be assessed at 10% of the market value for 10
years, 15% for the 11th year and 20% in the 12th year; and
