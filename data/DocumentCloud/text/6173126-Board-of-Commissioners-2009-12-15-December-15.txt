her monthly report. Per Commissioner Young, the Tenant Services Committee held its regular
2

 meeting on Wednesday, December 9, 2009 at 1:00 p.m. at the 60 East Van Buren Corporate
offices. Linda Kaiser, Executive Vice President for Resident Services and Jasmika Cook,
Associate Vice Chancellor of City Colleges, presented the Committee with an update on
Workforce Development at the City Colleges of Chicago.
Commissioner Young then introduced an Omnibus Motion for adoption of Resolutions for Items
A1 thru A5 discussed, voted and recommended for Board approval by the Tenant Services
Committee.
(Item A1)
The resolution for Item A1 approves the second one-year option of the Intergovernmental
Agreement with the City Colleges of Chicago (CCC) for educational services for CHA residents.
The Chicago Housing Authority’s Plan for Transformation represents a new beginning for public
housing residents in Chicago. The goal of the IGA has been to support the Plan’s selfsufficiency for families by creating a continuum of education and training services that allow
CHA residents to advance over time to progressively higher levels of education, and obtain
certification and employment that should ultimately result in better paying careers in areas of
economic importance. Under the IGA, existing degree and certification programs have
continued to be made available to CHA residents at no cost in areas such as healthcare,
transportation, warehousing, logistics, cosmetology, and services industries. In addition,
customized bridge programs have enabled residents needing more extensive education support to
move toward entry into degree and certification programs or directly to employment. City
Colleges provides staff dedicated to support residents as they attend educational programs. They
also have provided assistance with navigating CCC’s enrollment procedures, helped with
decision making about educational and employment tracks and ensured continued attendance in
CCC’s educational programs through tutoring and retention services. CCC’s staff dedication and
CHA participants’ desire to achieve self-sufficiency is seen in the 2009’s program outcomes. As
of October 2009, over 220 residents have completed a degree/certificate program, 114 are
currently enrolled and another 19 are waiting for their programs to begin. This is a 41% increase
from October 2008, and almost doubles the attendance from October 2007. In addition, 337
(81%) of the 2009 registrants have completed or still remain in their degree/certificate program.
CCC staff has conducted educational sessions with CHA case management providers, and over
650 residents have attended an orientation.
RESOLUTION NO. 2009-CHA-171
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the
Board Letter dated December 9, 2009, entitled, “RECOMMENDATION TO
AUTHORIZE THE SECOND ONE YEAR OPTION TO EXTEND THE
INTERGOVERNMENTAL AGREEMENT WITH THE CITY COLLEGES OF
CHICAGO FOR EDUCATIONAL SERVICES”;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer, or his
designee, to exercise the second one-year option the intergovernmental agreement
with the City Colleges of Chicago (“IGA”) for the period of January 1, 2010
through December 31, 2010 and increase the IGA’s not-to-exceed funding by an
amount not-to-exceed $1,000,000. The IGA’s new aggregate total not-to-exceed
funding amount will be $3,000.000.

(Item A2)
The resolution for Item A2 approves the second-one year option with Illinois Action For
Children (IAFC) to provide enhanced child care resource and referral services for CHA. As the
only agency funded by the State of Illinois to administer the Child Care Assistance Program for
Cook County, IAFC initiated a program of support for CHA residents or relocatees, who are
parents of young children. The program includes making enhanced referrals for families to child
care and/or early childhood education programs based on their specific needs and eligibility for
various programs. Enhanced referrals include an initial consultation to identify key indicators
and needs. Families are then contacted within two (2) days and provided substantial information
on available resources. Additional follow-up is made within a week to track child placement and
determine if additional follow-up is needed. As of September 2009, 299 enhanced referrals have
been completed, and over 2,200 informational packets have been distributed to residents. As the
Admissions and Continued Occupancy Policy’s (“ACOP”) work-requirement is increased to 20
3

 hours per week in FY2010, accessibility to childcare will become an increased need for these
families. Due to the success and importance of the enhanced referral program that has been
provided by IAFC, staff recommends the continuation of the enhanced referral program to
continue assisting CHA families in accessing the most effective childcare resource.
RESOLUTION NO. 2009-CHA-172
WHEREAS, The Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the
Board Letter dated December 9, 2009, entitled, “AUTHORIZATION TO
EXERCISE THE SECOND ONE-YEAR OPTION AND AMEND CONTRACT
NO. 7078 WITH ILLINOIS ACTION FOR CHILDREN TO PROVIDE
ENHANCED CHILD CARE RESOURCE AND REFERRAL SERVICES FOR
CHA FAMILIES”;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to exercise the second one-year option and amend Contract No. 7078
with Illinois Action for Children (“Contract”) to extend the Contract’s term for
the period of January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2010 and increase the
Contract’s not-to-exceed compensation by an amount not-to-exceed $160,000.
The Contract’s new aggregate total not-to-exceed compensation amount will be
$1,160,000.

(Item A3)
The resolution for Item A3 approves the second one-year option of the Intergovernmental
Agreement with the City of Chicago, Department of Public Health (CDPH), to provide substance
abuse services and wellness education for CHA residents. CHA will continue to partner with
CDPH, and its sub-contractor, Caritas, and will take a stronger role in facilitating effective
coordination with other CHA services (e.g. FamilyWorks). CHA will realign the scope to clarify
the specification of responsibilities, improve coordination and reporting of outcomes. Caritas
will assist FamilyWorks with admission into substance abuse treatment services, provide
educational workshops for residents on substance abuse effects and treatment, and educate/train
CHA staff and FamilyWorks providers. It is anticipated that referrals will increase in 2010 due
to the realigned service model resulting from the independent evaluation. The realignment of
services will also provide more effective follow-up services following the completion of
substance abuse treatment. In FY2010, CDPH will leverage this agreement and provide funding
for half of the program’s expenses. In addition to the provision of substance abuse services for
2010, CHA and CDPH are developing opportunities for other health and wellness services (e.g.
nutrition awareness, senior care, depression, stress management).
RESOLUTION NO. 2009-CHA-173
WHEREAS, The Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated December 9,
2009, entitled “RECOMMENDATION TO AUTHORIZE THE EXERCISE OF
THE SECOND ONE-YEAR OPTION OF THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL
AGREEMENT WITH THE CHICAGO DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH
FOR SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND WELLNESS SERVICES”;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

The Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to exercise the second one-year option of the Intergovernmental
Agreement (“IGA”) with the City of Chicago acting through the Chicago
Department of Public Health for the period of January 1, 2010 through December
31, 2010 and to increase the IGA’s funding in an amount not to exceed $167,500
to provide substance abuse services and wellness education for CHA residents.

(Item A4)
The resolution for Item A4 approves an Intergovernmental Agreement with the City of Chicago
Department of Family and Support Services (DFSS) to provide supportive services to CHA
residents. The following initiatives will be provided through a single IGA with DFSS: Out of

(Item A5)

There being no questions or discussion, the Chairperson thereupon declared said Motion carried
and said resolutions adopted. The Tenant Services Committee report was also accepted in total.
Commissioner Ponce, Chairperson of the Operations and Facilities Committee, then presented
his monthly report. Per Commissioner Ponce, the Operations and Facilities Committee meeting
was held on Wednesday, December 9th at approximately 1:55 p.m. at the 60 East Van Buren
Corporate offices.
Commissioner Ponce then introduced an Omnibus Motion for adoption of the Resolutions for
Items B1 thru B3 discussed, voted and recommended for Board approval by the Operations and
Facilities Committee.
(Item B1)
The CHA advertised Invitation for Bid (IFB) for the interior demolition work at Ralph J.
Pomeroy Apartments located at 1039 West Hollywood, Chicago, IL. The IFB was advertised in
area newspapers and on CHA’s website. The CHA received and opened seven bids and the
lowest, responsive and responsible bidder was Walsh Construction Company. Walsh has
considerable experience as a general contractor for CHA renovation efforts. Walsh has shown
the ability to bring projects in on time and within budget. Accordingly, the resolution for item B1
approves award of contract to Walsh Construction for the interior demolition at Pomeroy
Apartments. The demolition scope of work includes, but is not limited to, asbestos remediation,
lead remediation, microbial remediation, excrement remediation, environmental cleaning and
refuse disposal. This procurement will utilize Stimulus Funding under the American Recovery
and Reinvestment Act of 2009.
RESOLUTION NO. 2009-CHA-176
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated December 9,
2009 entitled “AUTHORIZATION TO EXECUTE CONTRACT WITH WALSH
CONSTRUCTION COMPANY OF IL FOR THE INTERIOR DEMOLITION
AT RALPH J. POMEROY APARTMENTS (IL2-039)”;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT

that the Board of Commissioners authorize the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to execute a contract with Walsh Construction Company of IL in the
amount of $1,447,000.00 for the interior demolition work at Ralph J. Pomeroy
Apartments (IL2-039), 1039 West Hollywood, Chicago, IL. The work is to be
completed within ninety (90) calendar days of the date set forth in the Notice to
Proceed.
This award is subject to the Contractor’s compliance with the CHA’s
MBE/WBE/DBE, Section 3 resident hiring, and bonding and insurance
requirements.

(Item B2)
The resolution for item B2 approves award of contract to Resource Center for the Recycling Buy
Back Program. The CHA is required to adhere to the City of Chicago’s Recycling Ordinance at
all residential locations. For the past 10 years, the CHA has utilized an Intergovernmental
Agreement (IGA) with the City of Chicago, Department of Streets and Sanitation (DSS) for the
Recycling Buy Back Program. The Resource Center was the underlying vendor contracted
through the IGA. Presently, the DSS does not intend to continue the Recycling Buy Back
Program and the program will end on December 31, 2009. Therefore, CHA desires to contract
directly with the Resource Center to continue the Program. The Resource Center was selected
by exigency and sole source because it is the only vendor that provides an up-front hands to
hands transaction, whereby the recyclables are inspected before placing them in containers (to
remove the risk of contamination), and includes an education component to educate residents
about recycling. All items collected are weighed and buyback values are assigned to these items
at the place and time of collection. In addition, the Resource Center provides incentives for
6

 participation. Residents receive a voucher for goods or groceries. The hands-to-hands
component of the Buy Back Program also works as a cost savings to the CHA.
RESOLUTION NO. 2009-CHA-177
WHEREAS, The Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the
Board Letter dated December 9, 2009, entitled “Recommendation to Award a
Contract for the Recycling Buy Back Program to the Resource Center”;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners hereby authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to enter into a non-compete service agreement with the Resource Center
for the Recycling Buy Back Program for a twenty-four (24) month period for an
amount not to exceed $821,352.00, with a one-year option period.

(Item B3)
A Request For Proposal for Professional Accessibility Consulting, consisting of three separate
components, was advertised in area newspapers and on CHA’s website in August 2009. Sixtythree vendors were solicited, including five MBE firms. Of the five submittals received and
evaluated, three firms scored within the competitive range and were invited to participate in
orals/discussions. After evaluating the oral presentations and considering the information given
in the written proposals, and the firms’ best and final offers, LCM was selected for an award of
contract. LCM has an extensive knowledge of accessibility codes and has years of experience
doing work very similar at other public entities, including other public housing authorities, the
Mayor’s Office for People with Disabilities, and sister agencies, such as Chicago Public Schools
and the Chicago Transit Authority, as well as past work with the CHA. Accordingly, the
resolution for Item B3 approves award of contract to LCM for Accessibility Consulting Services.

options to act as the CHA’s HUD-Approved Third-Party Certifier.

(Item B4)
The resolution for Item B4 approves the second option to extend the Intergovernmental
Agreement with the Chicago Police Department (CPD) to provide various CHA sites with
supplemental police services. In accordance with the current 2008 IGA, CPD has provided
specialized policing programs at Cabrini-Green Homes, Henry Horner/Westhaven, Altgeld,
Washington Park, Kenwood/Oakland communities, and the Ickes development. The IGA also
allows CHA and CPD to mutually agree to re-allocate police officers to other developments
when needed. In addition, CPD will continue to provide statistics, and relevant data including
reports of the activities of the assigned officers.
RESOLUTION NO. 2009-CHA-179
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letters dated December 9,

(Item C2)
CHA has approximately 600 tenants vacating public housing annually and in 2008 the average
amount written off per tenant was $245. Currently there is no formal collection process once

outstanding debts owed to CHA. The RFP was advertised in the area newspapers and on CHA’s
website. Only one proposal was received. Based on the recommendation of the evaluation team,

(ITEM C7 -THIS NUMBER NOT USED)
(Item C8)
CHA entered into an agreement with Konica Minolta Business Solutions to lease and maintain
20 high speed black and white copiers, one medium range black and white copier and one high
speed color copier at the new office location at 60 E. Van Buren. The total cost of the equipment
was comprised of lease charges, maintenance services, click (per page) charges and all supplies.
The incremental maintenance and click costs would accrue at an average blended rate of $.006
per copy/click. The copiers recommended and selected for CHA sole use were not adequate to
meet the unforeseen increase in the operational business needs of CHA and the initial projections
of usage and costs were not fully accurate. Staff did not account for the additional concentration
of internal copying demands due to office consolidation and demands of CHA’s Housing Choice
Voucher (HCV) Program vendors. The additional usage significantly increased CHA’s click
charges on the copiers. Accordingly the resolution for Item C8 ratifies and authorizes expenses
related to copier maintenance with Konica Minolta in the amount of $103,716.01 for the copier
maintenance for the period of April 2007 through November 2009 and $20,420.89 to extend the
contract for an additional three months.

WHEREAS,

RESOLUTION NO. 2009-CHA-186
the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter Dated
December 9, 2009, entitled “RATIFICATION OF $103,716.01 AND

designee to ratify and authorize the expenses for copier maintenance from
Konica Minolta in the amount of $103,716.01 for the period of April 2007
through November 2009, and additionally authorizes $20,420.89 for the
projected maintenance expenditures for a term of six (6) months for the
period covering December 2009 through May 2010, resulting in the total
additional funding for maintenance expenditures in an amount not-toexceed $124,136.90.

(Item C9)
The resolution for Item C9 approves the Annual Leave Distribution, donated Sick Leave and
Domestic Partners Polices. The Annual Leave Distribution Policy will allow eligible employees
to have half of their annual leave entitlement for the year automatically placed into their annual
leave bank for use, effective January 1, 2010. This advanced leave is provided to assist our
employees to remain eligible to receive pay while taking time away from work to address
personal matters. This new access to annual leave does not alter or reduce the amount of leave an
employee is eligible to accrue under the current annual/vacation leave plan. The Donated Sick
Leave Bank Policy establishes a sick leave donation back to provide a pool of sick leave days
that may be used for employees approved for Family Medical leave and during short term
disability insurance eligibility determination or waiting period. Sick leave granted from the bank
is not an entitlement, but a compassion initiative provided by CHA management. The Domestic
Partner policy seeks to promote acceptance of diversity in all its dimensions, including
cohabitation without marriage and sexual orientation. In consideration of this objective, an
employee of the CHA may register a domestic partner of that employee who will then become
eligible for the same benefits, including but not limited to health coverage, as are available to
spouses of individuals employed by the CHA.
RESOLUTION NO. 2009-CHA-187
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated December 9,
2009, entitled “REQUEST FOR APPROVAL OF THE ANNUAL LEAVE
DISTRIBUTION, THE DONATED SICK LEAVE BANK AND DOMESTIC
PARTNER POLICIES”;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners adopts the Annual Leave Distribution, Donated Sick
Leave and Domestic Partner policies for implementation on January 4, 2010.

(Item C10)
The resolution for Item C10 approves the New Employee Assisted Housing Benefit Policy
(EAHP). An employee assisted housing program is a housing benefit that employers can offer to
their eligible workforce to help them afford homes. CHA’s EAHP will require eligible
employees to purchase homes in CHA’s Mixed Income Communities, which will help CHA
provide income stability in its mixed income communities. Additionally, it will improve CHA’s
workforce’s access to local homeownership opportunities and reduce long commutes that can
result in tardiness, employee turnover and recruitment costs. The EAHP will be a cost effective
strategy to improve employee retention, productivity and morale.
RESOLUTION 2009-CHA-188
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated December 9,
2009 entitled “Request For Approval of the New Employee Assisted Housing
Benefit”;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY

12

 THAT,

the Board of Commissioners adopts the Employee Assisted Housing benefit dated
December 9, 2009, attached hereto as Exhibit A, for implementation on January 4,
2010 and authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to execute a
memorandum of understanding with Metropolitan Planning Council and Housing
Choice Partners.

(Item C11)
The resolution for Item C11 approves extension of employee benefits for Chicago Metropolitan
Housing Development Corporation (CMHDC). Since December 1998 and for each year
thereafter, the Board has approved and authorized CMHDC’s full-time employees’ participation
in the CHA’s medical/dental/disability, Employee Assistance Program (EAP), deferred
compensation and retirement plans. CMHDC has been responsible during these years for
making payments to the CHA for the employee benefit plans. Over the years CMHDC has been
making payments in a timely manner.
RESOLUTION NO. 2009-CHA-189
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated November 20,
2009, entitled “Request for Approval of Extension of Employee Benefits for
Chicago Metropolitan Housing Development Corporation (“CMHDC”)”;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chicago Metropolitan Housing
Development Corporation’s (“CMHDC”) fulltime employees to continue
participation in all of the CHA’s benefit plans made available to the CHA’s
employees for 2010, provided CMHDC makes all requisite payments to the CHA
on timely basis.

(Item C12)
The resolution for Item C12 amends the Sub-Grantee Agreements with MK Communication,
Piper Advisory Services and Lloyd Consulting utilizing funds from the McArthur Foundation
Grant. In May 2009, the Board accepted the Grant in the amount of $500,000 from the
MacArthur Foundation to assist in the funding of activities and events that will acknowledge the
tenth year anniversary of the Plan. At the time of grant acceptance, the Board approved that
CHA spend the balance of the grant on other expenses related to the ten year anniversary
activities. Because Piper, MK Communication and Lloyd are working with CHA leadership and
its partners to carry out the project plan, including documenting progress, lessons learned and
challenges since the inception of the Plan, identifying and evaluating mechanisms to advance
capital programs, and supporting outreach, communications and organizing external support for
the next phase of the Plan, CHA is requesting to reallocate funds available through the Grant to
increase the subcontractor agreements of Piper, MK Communications, and Lloyd.
