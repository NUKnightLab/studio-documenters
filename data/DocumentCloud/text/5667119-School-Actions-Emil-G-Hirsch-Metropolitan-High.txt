MS. BRADLEY:

Good evening.

In December of 2017,

16

the Chicago Board of Education approved a new charter

17

school, Art in Motion Charter School, to open in the

18

fall of 2018 at a location to be determined.

19

Art in Motion, otherwise known as AIM, is

20

authorized to open in the fall of 2018 with Grades 7

21

through 8 and will grow one grade per year until it

22

serves Grades 7 through 12.

23
24

AIM is a performing arts middle and high school
and with a project base in personalized learning

curriculum.

2

partnerships with organizations such as New Life and

3

anticipate on leveraging those partnerships to benefit

4

both AIM and the Hirsch High School communities.

5

They have established community

Through the new school selection process,

6

Art In Motions conducted community engagement in and

7

around the surrounding Hirsch and Greater Grand Crossing

8

area.

9

activities, community meetings, events and aldermanic

10

Community engagement has occurred through various

support.

11

Additionally, the District conducted its own

12

public hearing on November 6th, 2017, to assess

13

community engagement and support for the new charter

14

school.

15

The proposed co-location supports the need for

16

qualities in the Greater Grand Crossing community and

17

provides an opportunity for cross school collaboration

18

and leveraging partnerships to serve both the AIM and

19

Hirsch High School communities.

20

There are over 3000 students within a

21

three-mile radius of Hirsch, and 45 percent of those

22

students attend a school outside of the three-mile

23

radius.

24

Although AIM and Hirsch are two different

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 9, 2018
Page 9
1

school models, their collaborative partnership,

2

co-sharing benefits extended -- extend past sharing the

3

facility and provide supports such as shared teacher

4

professional development, student and family services,

5

afterschool programming for both student populations.

6

The existing Hirsch facility provides common

7

areas including the cafeteria and gymnasiums for both

8

schools' use.

I am

 January 9, 2018
Page 11
1

one of the elected officials of the Chicago Teachers

2

Union.

3

And I just wanted to say that I spoke at the

4

board meeting on December the 6th, and I brought up a

5

number of issues because we might be looking at this

6

thing through the lens of a -- of celebrity.

7

Understand, we have a celebrity rapper that's behind

8

this, we have a popular minister that's behind this, and

9

I'm not knocking that, but what I will tell you is that,

10

when you look at something like this, you want to follow

11

the money, and all the money flows to the top, and if

12

you go to the top, there is this organization, it is an

13

educational management organization by the name of

14

Distinctive Schools, and this organization has a history

15

because of the two individuals that control it,

16

Joseph Wise and David Sundstrom.

17

corruption, scandal, mismanagement and malfeasance,

18

Distinctive Schools.

19

Don't get dazzled by all the celebrity because all the

20

money is going to go to the top.

21

They have a history of

That's what you want to look at.

When -- If this were to become a charter

22

school, don't think that the people, that the teachers

23

the educators that are going to be working in here are

24

going to be making that much money until we unionize

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 9, 2018
Page 12
1

them of course.

2

until then all the money goes to the top.

3

to Distinctive Schools.

Then they'll be making some money.

But

So you want

4

And I brought up a number of issues at the

5

Board of Education to let them know the illustrious

6

history of Mr. Joseph Wise and David Sundstrom, and it

7

did not look too well, and I asked them to pause on this

8

thing, to take what I said into consideration;

9

mismanagement of monies in one school district, nepotism

10

in another.

11

You know, the list goes on.

And what concerns me is that Chicago Public

12

Schools has been under the lens of scandal too many

13

times.

14

selective enrollment scandal?

15

as 2015 we had a chief executive officer they sent to

16

prison?

17

Do you remember back in 2009 we had the
And then just as recently

Well, one of these individuals, Joseph Wise by

18

name, is the one that suggested that Barbara

19

Byrd-Bennett come to work in Chicago Public Schools.

20

And that's just one thing that I brought up.

21

We need to look at things like that.

We don't

22

need another scandal in Chicago Public Schools.

23

after I gave them all of the information, I won't go

24

through all of the details that I gave them because I

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

So

 January 9, 2018
Page 13
1

don't want to take up everyone's time, I know I can talk

2

as long as I want to, you all got two minutes, but I

3

just want to say this, I gave them a lot of facts, and

4

still they took about two -- after about two or three

5

hours later, they went in, they had their meeting, and

6

they adopted the proposal, nobody looked into it,

7

whereas, a few months -- a few weeks before that, the

8

Chicago Teachers Union had delivered a letter to

9

Mayor Rahm Emanuel, and we had delivered a letter to the

10

Inspector General of Chicago Public Schools detailing

11

the concerns of the individuals that are -- that are

12

involved in this in Distinctive Schools still.

13

Nobody wants to take due consideration and look

14

into these things.

15

I'm not going to let this go because I have children

16

myself that go to Chicago Public Schools.

So I'm still looking into it, and

I went to

All of my family did, my son,

And I think my grandkids are going to go

I don't want them to go to -- to come into a

do is slow down and look into the background, look into

Page 14

the history of these actors that want to take over this

school.

3

Don't get dazzled by the celebrity because the

money goes up to the top, and that's where the money is

going to go.

not to the educators that are going to be in this

demanding, because this is in the name of justice and

recognize an elected official who just walked in sitting

9

Mattie Hunter, state senator.

10

I've been out working all day in the

This is the district that I represent, part of

11

the district that I represent, and I'd like to introduce

12

Janis McReynolds, who runs my office here in Chicago.

13

I suppose this is a difficult meeting for me

14

because I have not really spoke with the local school

15

council, although they did reach out to me and made sure

16

that I came to the meeting today, which I am here.

17

And I have some issues throughout my district

18

as it relates to school closings, okay?

19

Englewood, so, you know, all the high schools over in

20

Englewood, they're closing those and building another

21

school, okay?

22

well, okay?

23
24

I represent

And then I have NTA in my district as

And so what I'd like to say is that all of
those schools where major changes are occurring, no one

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 9, 2018
Page 16
1

from CPS bothered to talk to me about it, including this

2

school as well, okay?

3

And so most elected -- most community people

4

feel that we know about it, we know about the changes,

5

we know about -- that we've attended the meetings and

6

that we are part of it, of the decision, and that's not

7

true, okay?

8
9

That is not true.

So let me go on record by saying that CPS has
not reached out to myself and the other elected

10

officials that represent -- from the general assembly,

11

state reps and state senators.

12

not at the table, there's no discussions about what's

13

going on.

14

want some legislative passed or when they need some

15

money, okay?

16

Most of the time we're

The only time we hear from them is when they

So I've worked my butt off for CPS every single

17

day in Springfield, okay?

18

state senators, there are two state senators in this

19

state where all of our district is in City of Chicago

20

proper.

21

they have the suburbs, okay?

22

And out of all of the 59

The others have pieces of Chicago, and then

So I am one of those legislators where my

23

entire district is in the City of Chicago.

24

Senator Patricia Van Pelt, who represents downtown and

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

The other is

 January 9, 2018
Page 17
1
2

the near west side and the west side, okay?
And so I always try to support and vote for

3

especially bringing in resources to Chicago Public

4

Schools, okay, I always do that because I always want

5

the teachers and I always want the -- the teachers to

6

have the resources that they need, and I always wanted

7

the students to have the resources that they need as

8

well, okay?

9

But you understand it is difficult for me to

10

support Chicago Public Schools when they don't even have

11

the respect, you see, to pick up the phone and call me.

12

And they have -- they have their governmental relations

13

people in the capitol every day, and they can't even

14

come by my office and say, Senator Hunter, I need to

15

talk to you about some changes that we're proposing to

16

make, okay?

17

So it really feels like a slap in the face to

18

me, okay?

19

hard, you know, for my district and for my constituents

20

in my district, okay?

And I don't like that because I worked too

21

So I know CPS is here.

Good.

Chicago Teachers

22

Union, I know you all are here.

Good.

And just so you

23

know, myself, Senator Jacqueline Collins, who represents

24

part of Englewood, Mary Flowers, who represents part of

312-853-0648

 January 9, 2018
Page 18

Englewood, Representative Tiberi, as well as Alderman

2

Moore and then some other --

3

Janis, who else is there?

4

-- and Sonya Harper, who has Englewood, we

5

all -- we have a scheduled meeting next week with

6

Janice.

7

blank.

What's Janice's last name?

I'm drawing a

8

Janice Jackson.

9

And Frank Clark, who is the head of the Chicago

I'm sorry.

10

Public School Board, okay?

11

meeting with them next Wednesday to address some of

12

these issues that I'm speaking of today and closing our

13

schools.

14

So we have a scheduled

Now, Englewood, we need a new school.

We need

15

a new school here.

16

that I'm against a brand new building, a brand new

17

school because the schools in our district are all

18

delapidated, and I know it.

19

So I'm not going to sit here and say

I attended DuSable High School.

I attended

20

Beethoven Elementary as well as DuSable, old schools,

21

and I know that.

22

at least give me the respectability to knock on my door

23

and say, hey, Senator, we need to talk to you about

24

something, can you come to a meeting?

So I support a new school, but can you

too much.
So, you know, yes, anytime -- anytime we can
improve the school system and the education of our kids,

10

fine, but I'd like to see some STEM programs and

11

technology programs, and, you know, I want our kids to

12

be qualified and be able to compete with other kids from

13

Whitney Young and Walter Payton School, you know, and

14

I'd like to have those kind of resources in this school.

and to, hopefully, work in partnership with all of you.

15

I don't believe that I can make any informed decisions

MR. VARN:

Good evening.

For those of you who don't

11

know me, my name is Larry Varn, and I'm the proud

12

principal of Hirsch Metropolitan High School, where we

13

stand for honor, integrity, resilience, courage and

14

hope, home of the Huskies.

15

This is not a place just where we call it a

16

school.

17

part of this home.

18

For many this is home.

And I am proud to be a

In 1896 Plessy versus Ferguson was a United

19

States Supreme Court Case that I'm sure we're all

20

familiar with.

21

upheld the constitutionality of separate but equal

doctrine.

23
24

In that case the supreme court uphold --

We all know it, that while things remain
separate, they will never be equal.

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

If Hirsch is to be

 January 9, 2018
Page 22
1

a co-located school, I am asking that we do so with the

2

equality for all involved.

3

There's been a lot said about what I think

4

about the co-location.

5

when it's been asked what does the principal think, I've

6

been too quiet for too long, and today you will know

7

exactly where Larry Varn, the person, the man and the

8

principal stands as it relates to the co-location of

9

Hirsch Metropolitan High School and Arts in Motion.

10

There's been a lot -- Many times

And it is simple.

It is that I believe that

11

every child deserves equality and education.

13

neglected for too long.

Hirsch has

In 2015 when I inherited Hirsch as principal,

15

Hirsch was the lowest performing high school in the City

16

of Chicago.

It did not happen overnight

19

and you have this in your handouts there.

20

to every other high school in CPS, it was solidly dead

21

last.

22

But God says different.

As compared

In 2016 when I came on

23

board as principal, in our first year, Hirsch was able

24

to see the one-year dropout rate cut nearly in half, the

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 9, 2018
Page 23
1

lowest decrease in all CPS schools citywide.

2

freshmen on-track rate rose 31.6 percentage points, the

3

largest increase of all CPS schools citywide.

4

tennis rate continued to increase year after year.

5

college persistence rate moved from 53 percent to

6

64 percent, an 11 point increase, again, the second

7

largest citywide.

8

It was not easy.

Our

Our

Out of my schools my boys

surveyed, we went from not-yet organized, the lowest

10

that one could possibly earn in that rating to

11

well-organized, the highest that a school could earn in

12

that rating, one of only two schools in CPS to achieve

13

that accomplishment.

14

In 2016 Hirsch moved from where we were in

15

2015, a 1.2 overall SQRP point to a 1.9, one-tenth of a

16

point away from being a Level 2 school, however, it was

17

the greatest increase of all CPS schools citywide with a

18

three-way tie.

Our goals for this year are included there, and

5

you'll see that, by the end of this year, we intend to

6

continue to move Hirsch in the upper trajectory.

7

However, we need support.

8

We need CPS' backing.

You have heard what the AIM and Distinctive

9

Schools have provided, and, yes, we have worked together

10

with AIM and New Life to do great things here at Hirsch.

11

AIM and Distinctive Schools are doing their

12

part to provide great opportunities for the children

13

15

16

extra-curriculum activities for the students in

17

Grand Crossing overall, and New Life is doing its part

The

But my question to you is; what will CPS do to

20

provide great opportunities for the children here at

21

Hirsch?

22

I ask you this.

If not us, then who will do

23

it?

24

now, then when will it happen?

If not here, then where will it happen?

And if not

Too many times CPS has

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 9, 2018
Page 25

2

done a co-location and it has not become successful.
If we are to do a co-location here at Hirsch

3

High School with AIM, then I request that it be done the

4

right way, that we do something that has never been

5

before in a way it has never happened before so that we

6

get results that we have not seen before and to return

7

to a co-location so that Hirsch does not become a school

8

that is co-located and then ceases to exist like we saw

9

in Englewood and early prep so that Hirsch does not

10

become the neighborhood high school that continues to

11

dwindle while its partner, the charter school, continues

12

to drive like we see at Butler and Corliss or at Bowland

13

and Baker.

14

So what will CPS do?

I'm asking CPS.

You see

15

where Hirsch was.

16

allowed it to get there.

17

up, we're turning in the right direction, we have the

18

right things in place to make those things happen except

19

for the resources that are necessary.

20

we can with what we have, but we're asking for more so

21

that we can get more done.

22

We ignored it for too long and
Hirsch is on its trajectory

We're doing what

Please, please CPS, my plea to you is that you

23

restore Hirsch Metropolitan High School, that you

24

re-invest in Hirsch Metropolitan High School and that

8

careers as police officers, firefighters, paramedics and

9

10

Hirsch Metropolitan High School is seeking to

11

neighborhood that is riddled with crime and violence and

12

is poverty-stricken.

13

invest in this school but allow this school to invest in

14

in this community by making its children get some

15

protectors of its own community, community policing and

16

safety for Grand Crossing with people from

17

Grand Crossing so that Grand Crossing can become a

18

greater place and truly put the greater back in

19

I'm a

10

Please forgive me.

I'm going to jump around a

11

little bit tonight because Mr. Brunson, eloquent

12

individual that he is, talked in many ways of the themes

13

that I wanted to speak about tonight, so I'll just to

jump around and add a little bit to what Mr. Brunson has

20

or guilty?

Likewise, the Chicago School

22

For the last 15 years, CPS has pursued a

23

strategy to disinvest in neighborhood schools, to

24

institute school-based budgeting so that funds flow to

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 9, 2018
Page 29

charter schools, to surround neighborhood schools with

2

shiny-looking charters, then explain, oh, look, the

3

public school is underutilized, we must co-locate it and

4

later close it or we'll just close it right now.

5

Meanwhile, behind their backs, the school board

6

is cutting deals with realtors who want to gentrify

7

certain neighborhoods, who simply want black folks and

8

black teachers to just please go away, who don't want to

9

pay taxes for the resources that give us good roads,

10

good schools and goods neighborhoods.

11

Look at closely the situation of

12

underresourcing public schools seems complicated.

13

are so many moving parts; state property taxes, job loss

14

But Rahm Emanuel has never been an

I just want to be very open and transparent
about our excitement for the work lying ahead.

10

As we've had discussions with Principal Varn

11

and other community members here, we're excited about

12

the vision of restoring, investing and rebranding, and

13

we want nothing more for the Hirsch community but to

14

continue to thrive and continue the great work that's

15

been started by Principal Varn but mostly the students

16

here at this school thriving.

17

I think the important work today and tonight is

18

kids.

equity that they deserve in the Grand Crossing community

20

with access to personal on viewing, innovation,

21

technology, performing arts and resources and materials

22

that will help them thrive.

Let's talk about the kids and the access and the

It's about

It's always been about the kids for us, and
We are

Students in the Grand Crossing community

20

are excited about Principal Varn's vision for the

21

Hirsch School, the focus on health and safety and

22

entrepreneuring for jobs and the vision for a small

23

school model and providing two very different school

24

models, providing choice for our children and providing

possible.

Thank you so much, and have a great night.
MS. LONG:

Hello, Everyone.

My name is Mary Long,

8

and I'm a community partner with Hirsch.

9

restorative justice facilitator, I assist with career

I'm a

10

building, college prep, resumes, I do a number of

11

things.

12

I walk halls, I get girls out of bathrooms, I stop them

13

from cursing, I tell them to pull their pants up.

14

I support the students in an overall setting.

It's a holistic approach that we have to take.

15

And I'm not hearing that.

16

going to wrap our arms around Hirsch community and

17

students.

18

some reason I keep hearing building.

19

hearing building?

20

I'm not hearing how we're

I keep hearing co-location building.

For

Why would I keep

We're talking about a family here.

I welcome

23

I'm not understanding how you're coming in and

24

beautifying and segregating a school that's in the same

I am a Christian by far, and I am not
I love the church, I love Christ, but

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

Page 41

community, I'm not understanding how as a Christian, I'm

2

not even talking about as a community person, but as a

3

church coming into a community, and you're saying I can

4

watch you, Sucker, down here, but we're going to be

5

striving up here, we're going to make -- we're

6

separating the building, and we're going to have

7

different times and different lunch periods and

8

different gyms, and everything is going to be separated.

9

I just don't -- That just -- It's just not registering

10

with me because my purpose here is to be able to display

11

care, love, to show -- to help out academically.

12

Some of our students, a lot of -- I've seen

13

students, and we are missing the mark.

14

the very students that need us the most, we're going to

15

separate?

16

There is -- I'm not seeing the haves and the have-not's.

If we think that

These are the students that need us the most.

17

My only child was killed one block from here,

18

one block, 79th and Ingleside, March 12th, 2012, and I

19

volunteered my time ever since.

20

of separating us, come in and build up Hirsch.

21
22
23
24

So I'm asking, instead

Thank you.
MS. PHILABER:

Good evening.

My name is

Carla Tatillo Philaber, and I am on the board of AIM.
And even though I have remarks prepared, I

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 9, 2018
Page 42
1

would like to speak to the question that my colleague

2

Mary brought up, all right, because what is co -- what

3

is -- yeah, what does Mary -- what does co-location

4

mean?

5

And that is a real question, right?
So how are the resources that we're going to

6

bring in to this community going to help the Hirsch

7

students?

8
9

Now, I'm sure your principal is very proud of
this young lady, right, valedictorian coming up here,

10

speaking so eloquently about the school and your needs.

11

If we came into the space in this building and

12

if we didn't see you as an asset and all of the students

13

here as an asset and built on those assets, that would

14

be a huge mistake.

15

the planning community is looking at things like student

16

wellness, looking at thing like socioemotional

17

awareness, restorative practices, restorative justice,

18

those pieces, and how they fit, right, because so often

19

I work with schools across the country, I work with

20

about, my organization is, 75 CPS schools a year, and we

21

all know when it doesn't work.

22

happens only in isolation.

23
24

So the work that I've done so far in

It doesn't work when it

And we've got an awesome justice circle
happening right here and then two doors down, the school

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 9, 2018
Page 43
1

climate and culture is an impact.

2

So I will tell you this is not my first rodeo.

3

I've been part of the team that built community links

4

high school 13 years ago under Dr. Carlos Fuentes'

5

guidance.

6

The question then is the same question that

7

every meeting I have with Distinctive Schools we ask.

8

Not like what's going to be sparking, what's going to be

9

brand new.

No.

It is how does this positively impact

10

the community.

11

know and have faith that every meeting we have we

12

address it.

13

And you're going to such a good one and

This only works if it impacts the community

14

that's here and we're sharing resources and we're being

15

thought partners and we're listening.

16

Now, I know that's tough because you're like,

17

well, I'm not in that meeting, I don't know what's being

18

said.

19

I get it.
But I'm here to tell you today that that is --

20

that is our new agenda, that is something that matters

21

to people because, when you look at impact and you look

22

at change, it can't happen in Room 304 and then not

23

happen at Room 307.

24

school community.

It's got to impact positively the

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 9, 2018
Page 44
1

Now, one way to do that, before my time is up,

2

is we have a partnership with the University of Chicago.

3

I'm also an adjunct faculty member for Roosevelt

4

University.

5

community members want data, too.

6

what's working, they want to know why decisions are

7

made, they want to know yes, they want to know why, they

8

want to know numbers.

9

Why does that matter?

Because parents and
They want to know

And so part of this work is to help provide

10

them with data and share that with students, and they're

11

like, hey, this is what we're seeing, how does this

12

work, how does this help, how does this positively

13

impact the community?

14

We'll be here.

If there's questions, I'd love

15

to continue the conversation.

16

the very articulate valedictorian, we all need that, and

17

I'd like to thank Dr. Ratliff and other members for

18

being here today.

19

MR. ROBBINS:

Again, I'd like to thank

Thank you so much.
Good evening.

My name is

20

David Robbins, and I'm here to speak on behalf of the

21

Caucas of Rank and File Educators and against the

22

co-location of another charter school at Hirsch and of

This year the budget at Hirsch from
Since 2015

Students at Hirsch deserve the same resources

10

and the same opportunity, the same financial support as

11

students in the suburbs.

12

It is time for the mayor and this unlikely

13

Board of Education to stop destroying CPS schools and

14

pushing African-Americans out of Chicago.

15

provide quality public schools and support them with the

16

resources the students need to be successful.

17

It is time to

Why does CPS have money for a new charter

18

school when they don't have money for their current

19

students at Hirsch?

It is time to stop privatizing our

6

I originally got involved in this work, if

I've been around a long time,

So I've got some -- I've got some long

People have stood up here and talked about what

7

somebody hasn't done.

8

done?

9

support Hirsch.

The question is, what have you

Ask yourself what have you done to help and

10

And, unashamedly, I can say that when Mr. Varn

11

first came over here, I came over here with him.

12

though I was working for Distinctive, they allowed me to

13

do that because he needed help and we wanted to help

14

him, and they allowed this to happen.

15

what I'm saying?

16

community with the businessmen and do a breakfast.

17

You're shaking your heads.

18

awesome.

19

don't remember how many students we had working on

My comment to

9

but the same thing I said when this was going on at

10

Calumet, where were you at before we got do this point,

11

what did you do before we got here but our students were

12

failing still, and you're protecting the teachers' job.

13

And then we have to take responsibility and

14

ownership ourselves, the parents, community members,

When I was getting the card for -- to speak, I

19

hadn't decided to speak, but they asked me was I for AIM

21

both, I'm for it because it's positive, it's bringing

22

resources into my community, and I pay taxes here, and

23

it's for me.

24

me to vote outside of my own self interest?

It would be asinine, did I say that, for

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 9, 2018
Page 49

And I see these faces that are organized forces

2

from Chicago's Teachers Union making statements about

3

black people being moved outside of the City of Chicago,

4

whereas I believe it's true, I think it's -- sometime

5

those faces are the wrong faces to be saying it.

6

This is how I see it.

I've done some research

7

with AIM.

8

have been admin -- have been sought for the

9

administration of the charter is Distinctive Schools.

AIM is the charter, the people that are --

10

Distinctive Schools are known, it's a collaboration.

11

And my understanding, with the resources that they bring

12

in, it's a positive source.

13

Listen, if Hirsch continued in the vein that

14

it's in now with the membership, it doesn't make sense

15

to keep this school open.

16

resources.

17

It does make sense to use the

I am concerned about the kids in this

18

community.

19

Distinctive Schools and AIM is community involvement.

20

The community doesn't have a voice with

21

New Life Covenant.

22

I think that the problem with

I joined New Life Covenant because I run in the

23

area and I pass by all that construction, and I didn't

24

feel justified in not being involved and paying for my

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 9, 2018
Page 50
1

share for it because that's a lot of investment being

2

brought into this community, and I don't see anybody

3

else bringing it in like that so I wanted to be a part

4

of it.

5

But the second thing is that, what's important

6

for us to maintain things and have control in our

7

community is for us to be -- to make sure that we have

8

our people, community people on the -- in the

9

decision-making process on the board for

10

Distinctive Schools and on the board for this AIM

11

project so that we can make sure that the right thing is

12

done.

13

It's positive.

We can't keep turning our back

14

on positive things happening into the community because

15

we do not have control of it.

16

responsibility to manage our own community.

17

stand up and do so.

18

MR. BAEHREND:

We have the

Hello there.

We need to

My name is

19

Chris Baehrend, and I'm president of the Chicago

20

Alliance of Charter Teachers and Staff with the union or

21

Charter Teachers in Chicago.

22

the charter schools in Chicago, and I'm here to tell you

23

why it would be a mistake to open a charter school here.

24

We represent 25 percent of

Schools are good, right, district schools,

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 9, 2018
Page 51
1

charter schools, and what the essence of the school is

2

are there are teachers and students, right?

3

put administrators in there, right?

4

I'll even

It's that community that, you know, thrives

5

will all work together well, right, whether they're a

6

charter or a district.

7
8

But the charter model of school governance is a
problem for a few reasons.

9

First of all, at the moment Chicago Public

10

Schools suffers under an unelected school board who

11

comprise largely noneducators.

12

in, you'll have -- you'll still be under that board, and

13

you'll have another board of noneducators.

14

under the board of -- the AIM.

15
16

When the charter comes

You'll be

And I assume there are -- how many educators do
they have on the board?

17

One?

18

Then Distinctive Schools, you'll have the

Okay.

19

charter organization, and there will be another board.

20

So you'll be under three boards comprised of largely

21

noneducators.

22

Also, you'll be giving up your right to an LSE.

23

LSE is where parents, community members, students can

24

have a say in their schools.

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

The teachers, themselves, can get fired now if

seen it happen, right?

4

speaking up for themselves if they want to form a union,

5

right?

6

I've

The teachers can get fired for

It's not -- You don't want to send your kids to

7

a school where teachers can get fired for speaking up

8

for your kids, do you?

9

That doesn't make sense.

Also, somebody talked about accountability.

10

Charters are a black hole in accountability.

11

dollars will go to a private organization, and unless we

12

form a union there, you'll never know where your money

13

went.

14

it's not being spent on the students, the resources the

15

kids need in the classroom.

16

Your tax

You can bet it's not being spent in the classroom

What we deserve in Chicago, District of

17

Chicago, fully funded Democratic schools.

18

the parents, the people who know the students need to

19

have a say in their education.

20

when a charter comes.

21

The teachers,

That's not what happens

And the last thing I'll say is this.

pushing charters, right?

2

somebody said this to me recently, and it makes a lot of

3

sense, choice, a demonstrative term, choice is democracy

4

for people without power.

5

People in this community deserve a school that they have

6

a Democratic say in, that's fully funded, that has all

7

the resources and opportunities for the kids here to

8

thrive and people have ownership over their own schools.

Good evening.

15

Excuse me if I kind of get comfortable here, see,

16

because we're comfortable and it has rained in our

17

community far too long.

18

Our people sit back, and they let our mental health

19

clinic get closed, WE let our public planning for public

20

services get closed, and all of a sudden, they're coming

21

for our schools.

Our community is comfortable.

22

It's a shame that 52 years ago we celebrated --

23

well, 52 years ago there was an action by public schools

24

to attack the idea of putting Pete's color trailers in

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

black school parking lots and playgrounds because of

2

school overcrowding.

3

Sadly enough to say, as we come back 52 years

4

later, now they're not trying to move the trailers into

5

the parking lot, they're trying to just tear down the

6

whole thing and privatize.

7

I have a problem with this thing and the --

Hello, hi.

And, you

My name is Aueonta Bester.

I am actually a junior at Hirsch, and I am a part of
student council.

11

And I just really wanted to say that I just

12

feel like we -- that they shouldn't co-locate our school

13

because Hirsch is its own school and we're one big happy

14

family, and -- and if they do, well, we're going to get

15

the kids from their school anyway because they're going

16

to --

17

Let me rephrase that.

18

Okay.

Okay.

I just feel like that they

19

shouldn't co-locate our school because Hirsch is its own

20

school, and this is our only neighborhood school around

21

here, and if the kids -- if they do co-locate Hirsch,

22

they're going to wind up kicking us out anyway, and then

23

where are we going to go?

24

accept us because it's all like selective enrollment,

No other school is going to

Good evening, Everyone.

My name is

Curtis Byron.

14 years, worked in the CPS system, learned the in's and

15

out's of a lot of what was happening, I'll tell, on both

16

sides good and bad, starting at Mireles Academy, going

17

into Englewood, working at the U of I up there,

18

finishing up over at Thorpe, which, by the way, was a

19

co-share.

20

I was a classroom teacher for about

Guess what, a co-share.

Co-share means nothing but comb your way out of

21

that building.

22

Ask Cole High School, ask TEAM Englewood.

You don't think that's going to happen?

Nothing against AIM if that's what's AIM is

But the question I have is two things.

Number

2

one, you have a senator, a state senator.

3

thought to tell that senator that this was a plan in

4

motion?

5

No one

And then on top of that, then you come to a

6

point where you decide that all of these great people

7

that work within the school system, within the network

8

are educators.

9

Well, the principal, the principal here.

I see the chief here who works hard.
These are

10

educators who are working hard, trying to keep things in

place, trying to maintain something.

12

with them or tell them.

13

push them out.

14

No.

You don't share

You give them no choice,

Now you're talking about having a co-share come

15

in and then work with the people here.

16

the plan?

17

Hope because they were the ones that's forced out.

18

Okay.

I ask again.

Really?

Is that

I ask Englewood and I

Oh, I got an idea, let's screw up a system that

19

we can mis-educate children, let's mislead the

20

community, let's put the people in the background on

21

this, and, yeah, by the way, at the end of the day,

22

let's see them fail.

23

begging us to open up a system that's going to be flawed

24

and failed.

Here's the other point.

How did all this stuff

3

start?

4

education is always an issue in the black community.

5

How does this always start, okay?

It looks like every time we turn around,

6

Okay.

SO let's look at it.

First, the state

7

was derelict in its duties, okay?

8

State of Illinois never should have given over the

9

Chicago Public Schools to the City of Chicago, to the

First of all, the

10

mayor of the City of Chicago because, when you do that,

11

what's going to happen, what's going to happen?

12

going to become a political foot wash.

13

It's

The state had money to fund the Chicago Public

14

Schools.

15

arguments with the city about the money AND how much is

16

left, how much is this, how much is that.

17
18
19

They never did it.

So, what happens?

They were always in

The state decides, okay,

we're going to give it to the mayor.
That was an act of irresponsibility, and we

20

should have -- we should have risen up at that point and

21

taken control because, basically, when you look at it,

22

state boards of education run state public schools, not

23

the city, not the mayor of these cities.

He's going to

pit this one against that one.

4

I'm tired of it.

That's why I say we're organizing, and we're

5

organizing this community so that this whole issue

6

around charter schools, this whole issue around

7

basically reconstituting Hirsch High School, we're going

8

to fight it, we're going to fight it.

And we want to sit down with the

10

decision-makers in here, the people in here who's

11

supposed to be making the decisions, the people in here

12

who are on the inside of the Distinctive Schools or

13

whatever these organizations are, we want to sit down

14

with them because we want to learn about what your

15

strategies are, what you're trying to do in this

16

community because, like I said, I went to Hirsch High

17

School as a freshman.

18

I had to leave Hirsch High School because my

19

mother said, okay, look, you're going to get out Hirsch

They snatch all of this away from you, and

We're going to give it --

And here's the wisest words of the

night, the young lady overhear in the pink shirt, she

said, guess what, they're going to change -- they're

going to change our attendance boundaries, they're going

to do what they've been doing all along and the new

10

schools won't take us.

11

And you know what?

You are right.

And we have

12

the statistics on that.

13

and then you ain't going to have a school.

to try to go to this school, and they say, no,

that we can blame, it's very easy to blame others for

2

the failure that we receive in terms of education.

3

what I'm taking is from my experience.

4

And

Every Tuesday I dedicated to going to the

5

library with my children, and I worked with them with

6

their homework.

7

They made good decisions, and they ended up being good

8

students.

9

All my children are successful models.

But here is the thing.

The key thing is, I did

10

not place the responsibility on the school system.

11

didn't even place the responsibility on the teachers.

12

The only thing that I wanted the teachers to do for my

13

kids from first to second grade, the first thing that

14

you do when you walk in that classroom, you ask your

15

teacher for a syllabus.

16

I

How many of you all tell your kids to ask a

17

teacher for a syllabus?

18

unknown for -- for a grade school student to go in and

19

ask for a syllabus, but by the time my children got to

20

the second or third grade, it was very well understood

21

you better have a syllabus for my children.

As a matter of fact, it was

responsibility, and I made sure that they did what they

were supposed to do.

their homework, it's important that we do those things

20

in the home.

21

One is that, yes,

22

talking a larger piece, we're a talking about a macro

23

level system's piece.

3

4

schools are just indications of that.

5

6

indications of that.

7

That's what's happening.

And the charter

take the money.

14

go in and you say, well, students are not achieving.

15

you put the ownness on the students, they're not

17

15

intentional choice to move to charter after a very

to do in order to really improve education.

I felt stuck

Southeast as well as a servant in the Greater Grand

21

Crossing community Monday through Friday, sometimes

22

Saturday I serve the Greater Grand Crossing community.

23

I've actually also worked with a group of ten

24

freshmen at Hirsch to put that mural in the hallway that

2

these young men together and talk about some life

3

issues, and one of the things that they came up with was

4

the word believe, believe.

5

So perception is reality.

There's a lot of

6

different comments, a lot of different commentary that's

7

being pushed out here, but it all boils down to the

heart, and my heart is for the youth, my heart will

9

always be to serve because I was raised by a single

10

mother, had me at 14 years old, and she raised me all by

11

herself, but my escape was school, and that's what made

12

me who I am today.

13

So I know that when situations get tight and

14

there seems like there's conflict in the atmosphere,

15

there's a change coming, whether you want it or not,

16

there is a change on the horizon, and it's a good change

because, see, there was a change when the resources

MS. HASS:

And the question is what

Ms. House, then April Shaw.

Hi, my name is Deb Hass, and I hadn't

11

planned on speaking tonight because I've spoken at a few

12

of these meetings before, but since there's a little bit

13

of time, I thought I'd give a little perspective as

14

somebody who served two years ago as part of the

15

southwest map.

16

That process, for those of you who aren't

17

aware, there's a process wherein CPS asked people to

18

review in detail charter school proposals from broad

19

swaths of the city.

20

neighborhood advisory councils, we were responsible for

21

looking at proposals for the entire southeast side.

22

So although they were called

There were a lot of problems with that process.

23

Folks who applied were asked to send people to that

24

process so it wasn't representative of the full range of

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 9, 2018
Page 78
1

community stakeholders but was full of people who maybe

2

already had an angle or a predisposition.

3

I served because I had been someone who worked

4

really hard to make sure my neighborhood school, Canter

5

School in Hyde Park, wasn't closed five years ago and

6

had been kind of shocked when CPS had told me as they

7

may have told many of you that there wouldn't be that

8

many students in some of these neighborhoods to support

9

schools in the future and that charter school proposals

10

started showing up.

11

So let me tell you a few things about this

12

proposal that I observed at that time, and I looked at

13

it in detail and through many late nights and did quite

14

a thorough analysis.

15

There were a lot of e-mail threats providing

16

support.

17

probably by this point of supposed documentation.

18

You can go online and see thousands of pages

So you heard the reps earlier.

The

19

documentation that says that Stratton was a supporter

20

and had been approached was just a chain of e-mails

21

asking for her support.

22

from her.

23

in this proposal was two years old for someone who is no

24

longer a state rep.

It wasn't a letter of support

The letter of support that had been prepared

The program was not well thought out.

I don't

2

think we have any evidence that Distinctive has any

3

better approach to delivering arts education than the

4

previous management company had.

5

not established, and I believe that they're still aren't

6

strong established partnerships now, although I can say

7

for sure.

10

The partnerships were

Since everyone else went over, I'm just going
to use an extra 30 seconds.
I think it's going to be incredibly disruptive

11

for the Hirsch High School community to have their

12

school co-located.

13

how to run these things.

14

that really can be disruptive to kids' educational

15

experience.

16

Who's going to tell the principal
These are just simple things

I personally have some real questions about the

17

approach that they're taking with personalized learning

18

which means that your core content is in front of a

19

computer.

20

But as a parent, one of my huge concerns is

21

that we hear all of this stuff about how New Life is

22

involved with this proposal providing services, and this

23

is a congregation that has taken stances and said things

24

like it's not okay to be algebra GQ.

may actually be detrimental to them, and I find it very

MS. SHAW:

Good evening.

My name is April Shaw, and

I'm an educator and a Chicago resident.
And I just want to say I've sat here today, and

13

I've listened, and I've heard a lot, and I think that I

14

want to make sure that people are listening carefully

15

and not get caught up in the term co-location because I

16

think that all of us that are here tonight are here for

17

the same reason, and we're here for our children, and

18

we're here to educate them properly, and we're here to

19

make sure that they have an impact and make an impact on

20

the future.

21

So I urge you to make sure that you listen to

22

the facts, that we do come together, we do sit around a

23

table and we do learn from one another and that we plan

24

accordingly for the success of these children, all of

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 9, 2018
Page 81
1

the children, not just AIM and not just Hirsch, but all

2

of the children because, ultimately, that's what we're

3

fighting for, and I think we're all fighting for the

4

same thing.

5

So let's not get caught up with co-location.

6

think that what we're doing here tonight is needed and

7

it's necessary for us to learn from one another, but I

8

think that may cause a real segregation that may occur

9

so let's not get caught up in the terms, let's educate

I

10

ourselves, let's get a little more information, a little

11

more insight, and let's work together as a team to make

12

sure that this does work and that we are impacting our

13

children and making a better future for our children and

14

our families.

I am -- I consider myself a father, an uncle to

12

he spent two weeks with me, and I spent time speaking to

13

him about what -- the importance of school.

14

He goes to school in South Bend, Indiana.

He changed his GPA from all D's and F's, and I

15

challenged him.

16

right now because I sat down and I reasoned with him.

17

And I told him, I said, I am not going to fuss with you,

18

I'm not going to argue with you, but one thing I know

19

about you, you're a very intelligent person, you are --

20

you are smart, and I want you to go back to school, and

21

I want you to correct some wrong and do right.
