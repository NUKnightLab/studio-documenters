RE: Gail Redmond City of Detroit, et a1
CASE NO.: 
FILE NO.: LIB-00723 (PMC)

On September 9, 2019, a case evaluation panel evaluated the above-captioned lawsuit and awarded
TWENTY-FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND NO CENTS in favor of the
plaintiff. The parties have until October 7, 2019, to either accept or reject the case evaluation
award. Failure to ?le a written acceptance or rejection within this period constitutes a rejection.

Based upon our review of the facts and particulars of this lawsuit, which are set forth in a
con?dential memorandum that is being separately hand-delivered to each member of Your
Honorable Body, it is our considered opinion that acceptance of the case evaluation award is in
the best interest of the City of Detroit.

We, therefore, request Your Honorable Body to authorize acceptance of the case evaluation award;
and, in the event that the plaintiff accepts the award, to deem such acceptance as a settlement and
to direct the Finance Director to issue a draft to Gail Redmond and her attorneys Romano Law,
PLLC, in the amount of THOUSAND DOLLARS AND NO CENTS
to be delivered upon receipt of a properly executed Release, and Stipulation and
Order of Dismissal entered in Lawsuit NO. 18-0143 69-NI, approved by the Law Department.

CFO MEMORANDUM
. NO. 2019-101-017
TO: Michael E. Duggan, Mayor; Honorable Detroit City Council 5? .
FROM: David P. Massaron, Chief Financial Officer . 
SUBJECT. Fiscal Impact of Proposed Contract between the City of Detroit and the Association of
Municipal Engineers (AME)
DATE: September 13, 2019

 

1. AUTHORITY

1.1. State of Michigan Public Act 279 of 1909, Section as amended by Public Act 182
of 2014, states the chief financial officer shall submit in writing to the mayor and the
governing body of the City his or her opinion on the effect that policy or budgetary
decisions made by the mayor or the governing body of the City will have on the City?s
annual budget and its four-year financial plan.

1.2. CFO Directive No. 2018-101-029 Fiscal Impact Statements states that the CFO shall issue
Fiscal Impact Statements for all items requiring fiscal impact statements, as defined in
that Directive, to provide financial information to the Mayor and the City Council as they
consider action on proposed local policy or budgetary decision items.

2. PURPOSE

2.1. To provide financial information to the Mayor and the Detroit City Council as they
consider action on the proposed contract between the City of Detroit (the ?City?) and
the Association of Municipal Engineers (the 

3. OBJECTIVE

3.1. This Memorandum serves as the report on the fiscal impact of the proposed contract in
relation to the City?s annual budget for FY 2020 and four-year financial plan for FY 2020
FY 2023 (the ?City budget?).

4. SCOPE

4.1. This Memorandum is not intended to convey any statements nor opinions on the
advisability of entering into the provisions in the proposed contract, including but not
limited to Work Rules, except for those components of the proposed contract that have
or may have a fiscal impact on the City budget.

4.2. This fiscal impact analysis is based on the proposed contract as further described below
in Section 5 of this Memorandum. Should the proposal change prior to final approval, an
updated CFO Memorandum on its fiscal impact would need to be issued.

5. STATEMENT
5.1. Conclusion: The proposed contract has no net negative impact on the City budget.

5.2. Background: The proposed contract?s financial provisions would impact the budget for
the BSEED and Public Works providing annual wage increases of 2% for all bargaining unit



CFO Memorandum No. 2019-101-017

members from FY 2020 through FY 2023. In addition to the 2% increase, there is a revised
salary scale that will result in a market rate adjustment for certain members. The revised
scale results in an 11% average market rate adjustment for impacted members, and a 3%

overall market rate adjustment across the entire bargaining unit.

5.3. Fiscal Impact: The proposed wage increases are budgeted, so there is no incremental
cost. The incremental cost created by the market rate adjustment can be offset with a
combination of historical underspending and operational efficiencies spread across the
departments. Thus, the proposed contract changes would not require the identification
of offsetting budget resources, and there is no net negative impact on the City budget.
