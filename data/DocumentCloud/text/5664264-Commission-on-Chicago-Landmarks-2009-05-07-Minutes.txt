 PERMIT REVIEW COMMITTEE REPORT TO
COMMISSION ON CHICAGO LANDMARKS
May 7, 2009
The Permit Review Committee (PRC) met on April 2nd, at 1:15 p.m. The meeting was held at 33 N.
LaSalle Street, Room 1600.
Present:

Ben Weese
John Baird
Phyllis Ellin

Staff:

Dijana Cuvalo
Beth Johnson
Cindy Roubik
Lawrence Shure

The following projects were reviewed by the PRC:
1.

921 W. Armitage
(Armitage-Halsted – 43rd Ward)
Proposal:

Violation: One-story masonry rooftop addition and other rooftop alterations
built without an approved permit

Action:

The Committee voted unanimously that the project will not have an adverse
effect on the significant historical and architectural features of the landmark
district due to its minimal visibility from within the district, given the addition’s
substantial setback, massing, size and materials, as well as architectural and
historic character of the district, and approved the project as submitted.
The Committee noted that visible rooftop additions can easily have a
detrimental impact on a landmark district due to inappropriate location, size,
and materials, and their resultant visibility and impact on historic rooflines.
Such proposals are reviewed on a case-by-case basis. When this type of
construction is undertaken without a valid permit or Commission approval, the
result could potentially be deemed detrimental to the district, requiring reversal.

2.

4727 S. Greenwood
(Kenwood District – 4th Ward)
Informational Only: Emergency partial demolition of the third floor of a masonry singlefamily residence, deemed necessary to remedy conditions imminently dangerous to life, health,
or property by order of the Department of Buildings pursuant to Section 2-120-780 of the
Chicago Landmarks Ordinance

3.

Grant Park at Congress Drive
(Clarence Buckingham Memorial Fountain and Garden – 42nd Ward)
Informational Only: Phase 1 work (replacement of the fountain table paving; new walkways,
seating, lighting, and landscaping; and repairs of historic metal fencing) is complete
