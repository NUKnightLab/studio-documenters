Please remember that this is a well-attended meeting with many, many people
participating all over the State. To make sure that everyone has the best chance of hearing
the conversation, PLEASE MUTE YOUR PHONE. Do Not place the call on hold. Hold music
and other hold tones are very disruptive to the entire group.
Please remember to identify yourself, whether you are in person in Chicago, on the phone
or in Springfield. This makes it easier for the note taker and for those who don’t recognize
your voice.
