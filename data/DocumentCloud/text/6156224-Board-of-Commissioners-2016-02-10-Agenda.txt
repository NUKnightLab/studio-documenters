PROPOSED RESOLUTION
URGING THE ILLINOIS STATE LEGISLATURE TO RESTORE COOK COUNTY’S
12-MONTH GRACE PERIOD BEFORE PROPERTIES ARE OFFERED TO TAX BUYERS
WHEREAS, second installment Cook County property taxes are due in early August each year; and
WHEREAS, taxpayers historically have had until August of the following year before the Cook County
Treasurer was required to offer their unpaid taxes for sale to tax buyers; and
Page 10 of 64

 Board of Commissioners

BOARD AGENDA

February 10, 2016

WHEREAS, tax buyers “purchase” the unpaid taxes at annually held tax sales. In exchange for fronting
the money, tax buyers also buy a guarantee that indebted property owners will either repay them the full
tax amount plus fees and interest, or else tax buyers have a right-two years later-to take title to the
property; and
WHEREAS, as the law stands today, taxpayers will lose two months of the current twelve-month grace
period for tax year 2014 (tax sale June 2016 instead of August 2016); they will lose two additional
months for tax year 2015, and lose four additional months for tax year 2016. In tax year 2016 and in
subsequent years, taxpayers will have only four months after the due date to pay their taxes in full before
their taxes are offered to tax buyers; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Treasurer currently receives 1.5% interest per month on delinquent taxes;
and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Treasurer estimates that the aggregate loss of tax sale revenue to Cook
County over the next three years alone will be $84 million. Specifically, in tax year 2014 when the sale is
two months earlier the County is estimated to lose $12 million in revenue; in tax year 2015 when the sale
is four months earlier the County is estimated to lose $24 million in revenue; and in tax year 2016 when
the sale is eight months earlier the County is estimated to lose $48 million in revenue; and
WHEREAS, the property tax burden on Chicago residents and on all Cook County residents continues
to rise even without this change; and
WHEREAS, although having more taxes auctioned would bring revenues more quickly to taxing
districts, this accelerated schedule comes at the expense of taxpayers and benefits tax buyers the most;
and
WHEREAS, Cook County taxpayers deserve more than four months to pay their taxes before they are
offered to tax buyers.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners contact
state legislators and urge them to restore the tax sale schedule’s twelve-month grace period, the way it
has been in the past.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a copy of this resolution be distributed to the Illinois State
Legislature.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
RESOLUTION IN SUPPORT OF NON-CITIZEN VETERANS REMOVED FROM THE
UNITED STATES

WHEREAS, there are a significant number of non-citizen veterans of foreign wars, including
Page 11 of 64

 Board of Commissioners

BOARD AGENDA

February 10, 2016

World War II, Vietnam, Korea, Gulf Wars, Iraq and Afghanistan who have been removed from
the United States; and
WHEREAS, these veterans currently live in terrible and abject conditions after having served in
the armed services of the United States; and
WHEREAS, several of these veterans have asked for support in obtaining reentry into the
United States to be with their families and U.S. citizen children; and
WHEREAS, non-citizens compose a significant portion of the armed forces, enlisting more than
8,000 persons annually; and
WHEREAS, according to the Department of Defense, more than 65,000 non-citizen immigrants
were serving in the U.S. armed forces as of 2008- accounting for at least 5% of the total
active-duty personnel; and
WHEREAS, the Immigration Reform Act of 1996 broadened the criteria for removable offenses
to include shoplifting, misdemeanor drug offenses and other minor offenses, allowing the
Department of Homeland Security to quietly deport veterans who have fallen on hard times; and
WHEREAS, according to Banished Veterans, a support group for deported veterans, there are
currently 3,000 veterans in immigration detention centers or in removal proceedings at any given
time; and
WHEREAS, veterans that have been deported do not have access to Veterans Affairs benefits or
other benefits designed for veterans; and
WHEREAS, the nation owes these veterans adequate support and rehabilitation equal to that of
veterans with full citizenship; and
WHEREAS, the non-citizen parents, spouses and children of veterans and service men and
women who have been killed during active duty still face risk of deportation; and
WHEREAS, these veteran family members also need adequate rehabilitation and mental health
resources in order to cope with extreme hardship and loss that is a result of war; and
WHEREAS, after having served time for their crimes in the criminal justice system, they are
almost immediately afterwards dropped at the doorsteps of their country of birth - with no
resources, no contacts and, at times, no knowledge of the language, resulting in compounded
punishment; and

Page 12 of 64

BOARD AGENDA

February 10, 2016

WHEREAS, these valiant yet deported veterans are solely allowed reentry into the United States
posthumously for their burial in a U.S. military cemetery.
NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners
will bring to light the plight of these veterans and raise awareness to members of the United
States Congress and to the President of the United States in a determined effort to gain equal
treatment to these veterans, their families and communities in the United States.

Concurrences:
The vendor has met the Minority and Women-owned Business Enterprise Ordinance.
The Chief Procurement Officer concurs.
The Bureau of Technology concurs
Summary: The Office of Enterprise Resource Planning seeks to increase the following services from
WorkForce Software:
(a) Additional User Acceptance Testing (UAT) support/training;
(b) Additional enterprise employee training;
(c) Increasing enterprise rollout phases from 5 to 6;
(d) Additional professional services to due to additional services.
Based upon lessons learned from the Pilot implementation of Time and Attendance, the project team has
identified the necessity of expanding the enterprise UAT process with additional vendor support and
training for County agencies. This will also allow for a segmented Enterprise UAT which allows for
increased focus on each County agency.
The original contract allowed only for ‘Train the Trainer” model activities, which has proven to be an
unsuccessful model of training based upon past Enterprise rollout experience. This expanded training
includes instructor led courses, E-Learning modules, and job aides.
In addition to the necessity of expanding enterprise UAT activities, based upon the Pilot implementation,
it has become clear that an additional enterprise rollout phase will be needed in order to ensure successful
launch of the larger County agencies. Additional vendor support and availability will be required
to
handle the additional rollout phase.
Finally, due to the complex and dynamic nature of the County’s payroll rules, additional configuration
and testing of the system is required to ensure a functional system for all County agencies.

rehabilitation; and
WHEREAS, in the instance where the property does not meet the definition of abandoned property, the
municipality or the Board of Commissioners, may determine that special circumstances may exist that
justify finding that the property is abandoned for purpose of Class 8; and
WHEREAS, in the case of abandonment of over 24 months and no purchase for value by a disinterested
buyer, the County may determine that special circumstances justify finding the property as being deemed
abandoned; and
WHEREAS, Class 8 requires a resolution by the County Board validating the property as abandoned for

Summary: This proposed amendment exercises the first year renewal option available in the
Cook County contract with Sentinel Offender Services, LLC for electronic monitoring and
Global Positioning System (GPS) services for the Adult Probation Department and Juvenile
Probation and Court Services Department minor and adult clients who are ordered by the court to
wear electronic monitoring devices. Sentinel provides GPS monitoring equipment and services for
adult probationers and pretrial defendants in order to comply with Public Act 95-0773, also known as the
Cindy Bischof Law, which calls for the monitoring of certain domestic violence offenders through GPS
technology. The law allows the court to order adults charged with certain domestic violence offenses to be
monitored electronically by the Adult Probation Department Home Confinement Unit as a condition of
bail or probation. Offenders are ordered to wear a GPS tracking device to help monitor compliance with
orders to stay away from the complaining witness, the complaining witness’s home/workplace, or any
other protected address specified. There are currently more than 170 adults under GPS monitoring and 80
victims who carry GPS devices to create mobile exclusion zones. Effective on 1/1/2015, new legislation
(Public Act 98-1012, 725 ILCS 5/110-5) significantly expanded the types of charges required to be
considered for GPS monitoring as a condition of bail.
GPS technology is also used by the Juvenile Probation and Court Services Department to monitor
high-risk minors in home confinement as an alternative to secure detention or as a condition of release
into the community. These devices are deployed at various points of the judicial process from
pre-adjudication through post-dispositional stages of court proceedings. There are currently more than
230 court-involved youth under GPS electronic surveillance.
The contract was awarded through the Request for Proposals (RFP) process in accordance with the Cook
County Procurement Code. Sentinel Offender Services, LLC. was awarded this contract based on
established evaluation criteria.
