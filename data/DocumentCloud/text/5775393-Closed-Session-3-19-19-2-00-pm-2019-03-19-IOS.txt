RE: Working Group for Community Control Over Police Surveillance (CCOPS)

 

With an increase in local police surveillance technologies, it is important to create an open and
transparent process for the approval or rejection of local surveillance technologies. My of?ce is
partnering with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) who has developed a policy, the
Community Control over Police Surveillance (CCOP S) ordinance, in order to address these
lssues.

Throughout history surveillance efforts have been used to intimidate and oppress certain
communities and groups more than others. Including those that are de?ned by a common race,
ethnicity, religion, national origin, income level, sexual orientation or political perspective;
surveillance technology may threaten the privacy of all citizens. Thus, legally enforceable
safeguards, including robust transparency, oversight and accountability measures, must be in
place to protect civil rights and civil liberties before any surveillance technology is deployed and
it is important to have an informed public debate as early as possible about decisions related to
surveillance technology. Seattle, WA, Santa Clara, CA, Nashville, TN and other cities have
already implemented various policy around surveillance technology.

Thus, this memo is to request that a working group be convened in order to have discussions
around the CCOPS Ordinance. The departments being requested to send a representative are:
Detroit Police, Board of Police Commissioners, Law, and Legislative Policy Division.
