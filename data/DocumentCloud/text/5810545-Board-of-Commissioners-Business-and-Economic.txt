Committee

 

WHEREAS, vacant properties can devastate a neighborhood and block, undermine neighbors? quality of
life, and diminish the value of nearby properties; and

WHEREAS, they also cause severe ?scal damage to local governments, reducing local tax revenues
while costing cities millions for policing, cleaning vacant lots, and demolishing derelict buildings; and

WHEREAS, most vacant buildings and houses are well maintained, but many are not and thousands can
sit empty for years, abandoned by their owners, deteriorating to the point where they cannot be reused
without major rehabilitation with many ultimately demolished, leaving vacant lots in their place; and

WHEREAS, besides their impact on social and economic conditions, vacant, abandoned properties have
a devastating effect on the ?scal condition of their cities, towns, and counties; and

WHEREAS, not only do they pay little in property taxes and generate little revenue for the city or county
when sold at tax sales, but they further reduce property tax collections by millions of dollars by devaluing
neighboring properties; and

WHEREAS, among the County?s tools to assist in jumpstarting economic development and turning

communities around are tax incentives; however, owners of vacant property, who receive said incentives
should not be able to inde?nitely bene?t from them without developing and re-purposing such properties;
