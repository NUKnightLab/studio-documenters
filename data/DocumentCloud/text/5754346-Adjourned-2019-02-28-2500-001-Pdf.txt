BY COUNCIL MEMBER CASTANEDA-LOPEZ:

RESOLUTION SUPPORTING SENATE BILL 45, THE EQUAL LANGUAGE

WHEREAS,

WHEREAS,

WHEREAS,

WHEREAS,

RESOLVED,

RESOLVED,

February 2019

ACCESS TO STATE SERVICESACT

On January 22, 2019, State Senator Stephanie Chang of Detroit introduced
Senate Bill 45, which seeks to create a new State act ?to facilitate access
to state services by individuals with limited English pro?ciency; to
provide for the powers and duties of certain state governmental of?cers
and entities; to provide for biennial reports concerning equal language
access; and to establish a process for submitting complaints and obtaining
remedies for lack of equal language access?; and

SB 45 is consistent with the Federal government policy pronounced by
Executive Order 13166, signed on August 11, 2000, which ?requires
Federal agencies to examine the services they provide, identify any need
for services to those with limited English pro?ciency (LEP), and develop
and implement a system to provide those services so LEP persons can
have meaningful access to them?; and

Equal language access is perhaps the most basic building block for the
success of Detroit?s immigrant community and our city as a whole. As
stated in the Detroit City Council?s resolution af?rming our Welcoming
City status, ?the City of Detroit believes in the innate dignity of all its
residents and recognizes the importance of their valuable contributions to
the social, religious, cultural, and economic life within the city. The City
of Detroit acknowledges, honors, and values our immigrant and migrant
roots, and embraces the values of family, faith, and hard work?; and

Advances in language access for all Michigan and Detroit residents will
improve our quality of life and bene?t everyone. NOW THEREFORE
BE IT

That the Detroit City Council wholeheartedly supports adoption of Senate
Bill 45, The Equal Language Access To State Services Act; BE IT
FINALLY

That copies of this resolution shall be transmitted to the Mayor and the
City?s lobbyists, the Governor and the Detroit delegation in the State
Legislature.
