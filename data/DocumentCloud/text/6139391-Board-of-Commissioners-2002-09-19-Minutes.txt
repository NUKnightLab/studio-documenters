 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 19, 2002

Chairman Daley stated Mr. Glaser and Ms. Dunnings has met with all Commissioners, or attempted to,
regarding the proposed ordinance. Chairman Daley entered into the record a letter from Mr. Glaser and
Ms. Dunnings relative to the proposed General Obligation Refunding Bonds, Series 2002D and a copy
was also provided to the court reporter to be included as part of the record. (See submitted).
Chainnan Daley asked Ms. Dunnings to give an overview of the proposed ordinance and introduce the
financing team participants.
Ms. Dunnings stated this ordinance authorizes the issuance of a maxim um of $2,675,950,000 of general
obligation bonds to refund, or refinance, all of the County's current outstanding bonds. The first series to
be issued is projected to be approximately $ 175 million with the present value savings of $6 million. It
also provides that the bonds can be issued in several series, including fixed and variable rate modes.
Ms. Dunnings proceeded with the introduction of the Financing Team Participants: Co-Senior Manages :
UBS Paine Webber and William Blair & Company; Co-Managers : Goldman, Saches & Company, Bank
One Capital Markets, Bear Sterns, Loop Capital Markets, Apex Pryor Securities, and M.R. Beal and
Company; Co-Bond Counsel: Altheimer & Gray, and William P. Tuggle & Associates; Co-Underwriter's
Counsel: Burke, Burns & Pinelli, Ltd., and Caldwell & Associates; Co-Financial Advisors: Clark
Burrus, A.C. Advisory, and Davis Financial; and Trustee: Seaway National Bank.

this coming year, are two aspects of this transaction he fully supports. He further stated this is a win-win
situation for the County and the taxpayers of this County.
Commissioner Goslin commented it is important to note when discussing this matter, it involves
refinancing, not refunding. He further stated the County is refinancing its debt to lower the debt service,
and expressed his support for the proposed ordinance.
Commissioner Sutker indicated his support for this proposal. He continued by stating it makes economic
sense, and it shows fi scal responsibility.
Chairman Daley asked the Secretary if she had received notifications from members of the public
indicating a desire to be heard at this public hearing. The Secretary stated that no members of the public
had registered to be heard on the proposed ordinance.

Commissioner Lechowicz, seconded by Commissioner Sims, moved that the Ordinance (Item

Section 7.2.

sha ll receive notice from the County of its election to redeem Bonds, the Trustee sha ll, in accordance with
the terms and provisions of such Bonds and of this Ordinance and the Bond Order, select the Bonds to be
redeemed as described in Section 7.3 and Section 7.6 and, unless waived by the owner of Bonds to be
redeemed, shall give notice of the redemption of such Bonds. Notice of any such redemption shall be
given by the Trustee on behalf of the County by mailing the redemption notice by first class ma il not less
than 30 days and not more than 60 days pri or to the date fixed for redemption to each registered owner of
the Bond or Bonds to be redeemed at the address shown on the registration books maintained by the
Trustee or at such other address as is furni shed in writing by such registered owners to the Trustee.
A ll notices of redemption sha ll include, at a minimum, the information as fo llows:
( I)

the redem ption date;

(2)

the Redemption Price;

(3) if less than all of the Bonds of a partic ular Series are to be redeemed, the
identification (and, in the case of partial redemption, the respective principal amounts) of the
Bonds to be redeemed;
(4) a statement that on the redemption date the Rede mption Price will become due and
payable upon each such Bond or portion thereof called for redemption and that interest thereon
shall cease to accrue from and after said date; and
(5) the place where such Bonds are to be surrendered for pay ment of the Redemption
Price, which place of payment sha ll be the principal corporate trust office of the Trustee.
Such additional notice as may be agreed upon with the Depository shall also be given so long as

shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other registered owners. Notice having been
properly given, fai lure of a registered owner of a Bond to receive such notice shall not be deemed to
invalidate, limit or delay the effect of the notice or the redemption action described in the notice. Such
notice may be waived in writing by a registered owner of a Bond, either before or after the event, and
such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice shall be filed with the Trustee, but
such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in re liance upon such
waiver. Upon surrender of such Bonds fo r redemption in accordance with said notice, such Bonds shall
be paid by the Trustee at the Redemption Price. Interest due on or prior to the redemption date shall be
payable as herein provided fo r payment of interest. Upon surrender for any partial redemption of any
Bond, there shall be prepared for the registered owner (a) in the case of any Capital Appreciation Bond, a

need not be acknowledged or verified, of an officer of a bank, trust company or financial firm or
corporation satisfactory to the Trustee that the person signing such instrument acknowledged to such
bank, trust company, firm or corporation the execution thereof.
(B)
The authority of a person or persons to execute any such instrument on behalf of a

OFF ICE OF CAPITAL PLANNING AND POLICY, by Michael E. LaMont, Director,
transmitting a Communication, dated August 26, 2002:
Transmitted herewith for your approval is a request for authorization for the Purchasing
Agent to advertise for bids for Countywide Building Exterior Inspection and Stabilization Phase I. It is respectfully requested that this honorable body approve this request.
Phase I of this project is the exterior wall stabilization of the South Campus Building 4 at the
Department of Corrections and the I900 W. Polk Building on the Stroger Hospital of Cook
County Campus, and the stabili zation of portions of the parapet wall at the Fantus Clinic.
The County's consultant has recommended that this work be commenced as soon as possible.
Bond Issue (20000 Account).
Sufficient funds have been appropriated to cover this request.

*Referred to the Construction Committee on 9/05/02.
Commissioner Hansen asked what is the problem with the 1900 Polk building?
Michael LaMont stated that the building needs stabilization, tuck-pointing, stone work, general tuckpointing, and window headers. He stated that the work is not in just one area but needs to be done in
different parts of the building.
Commissioner Hansen asked Mr. LaMont to define stabilization and a breakdown of the $7.8 million
based on estimates.

3269

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 19, 2002

Michael LaMont stated that the $7.8 million includes all the critical inspections that need to be performed.
He said approximately $3 million is for the inspections alone, and the remainder is for stabilization work.
He further stated that he will provide the commissioners with more back up on how the figures were
determined.
Michael LaMont asked Donald Hitchcock of Soodan and Associates, to further respond to the question.
Mr. Hitchcock, stated that Soodan and Associates is in the process of performing the critical examination
of the buildings. He said the critical examination has been completed at the 1900 Polk building and some
of the facade materials need to be removed for safety, some inspection openings need to be stabilized per
code and put back. Further, he stated that the visual inspection has been completed and the consultant is
in the process of writing the report and detennining the total cost of the repairs. He concluded by saying
that once the report is completed, the commissioners would receive a copy.
Commissioner Hansen asked how did the Office of Capital Planning and Policy arrive at the $7.8 million
figure?
Michael LaMont stated that the amount of $7.8 million was a budgetary figure, which was arrived at a
year ago to initialize the project.
Commissioner Hansen asked how much money was allocated for the 1900 West Polk building?
Michael LaMont stated that he did not have that figure, but he would forward it to the commissioner.
Michael LaMont stated that the stabilization of the south campus was not part of the $7.8 million. The
reason is the $7.8 million was estimated to cover the inspections, and the estimated stabilization of all
buildings that are six stories or eighty feet in height or more as required by the city ordinance. Finally,
Mr. LaMont stated that the reason the Office of Capital Planning and Policy decided to stabilize the south
campus is because on July 4, 2002, an entire section of cornice fell off the building and needs to be
repaired.
Commissioner Hansen asked when will a ll the inspections be completed?
Michael LaMont responded that the critical inspections for the buildings covered by the City of Chicago
Ordinance must be completed by November I, 2002.
