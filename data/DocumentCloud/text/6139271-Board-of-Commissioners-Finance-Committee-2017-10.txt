PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT

PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT TO REPEAL THE SWEETENED BEVERAGE
TAX

WHEREAS, the Sweetened Beverage Tax Ordinance was approved and adopted on November 10, 2016;
and

WHEREAS, it has becoming increasingly clear that this is a regressive tax which will cause immediate
and irrevocable hardship to businesses in Cook County and put those businesses in competitive
disadvantage to businesses nearby; and

WHEREAS, the U. S. Census Bureau has reported that from July of 2015 to June of 2016 Cook County
has lost more population than any other county in the entire United States; and

WHEREAS, it has been widely reported that one of the main reasons businesses and residents are
moving out of Cook County is excessive tax regulations; and

WHEREAS, a lawsuit has been filed questioning the constitutionality of this ordinance and Cook County
may again be forced to spend huge sums to defend a potentially unconstitutional ordinance; and

WHEREAS, Crain?s has reported that a recent poll conducted by a credible organization shows that 87
percent of Cook County residents are not in favor of the sweetened beverage tax; and

WHEREAS, although this regressive tax has only been in effect a short time, it appears that many
consumers are crossing county borders to purchase items being taxed and are also buying others items
leading to an ultimate loss of tax dollars to our neighboring counties and states; and

WHEREAS, it is in the best interest of the citizens and businesses of Cook County that this regressive
tax ordinance be repealed;

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioner that Chapter

74 Taxation, Article XXII Sweetened Beverage Tax, Sections 74-850 through 74?859 of the Cook County
Code is hereby amended as follows:
