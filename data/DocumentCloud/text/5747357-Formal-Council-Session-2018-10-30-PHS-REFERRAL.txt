Gordie Howe International Bridge Jurisdiction Issues

On August 17, 2018, Council Member Castaneda-Lopez requested that the Legislative Policy
Division (LPD) provide a detailed report and map regarding areas within the Delray neighborhood
subject to federal, state and local jurisdiction during construction of the Gordie Howe International
Bridge (GHIB), as well as providing an opinion whether or not state, federal and international
entities are required to comply with certain local laws.

As Council knows, the Gordie Howe International Bridge (GHIB) is in the early stages of site
preparation for construction of a new international bridge crossing between Detroit?s Delray
neighborhood and Windsor, directly across the Detroit River. The international entity charged
with this huge undertaking is the Windsor/Detroit Bridge Authority (WDBA). Their web site
contains a wealth of information about the project and the WDBA.

Applicable Laws

To the best of understanding of this relatively complex structure and process, the most
relevant document that speaks to legal jurisdictional issues is the 54-paue "Crossing Agreement".
That rigorously drafted document, dated June 15, 2012, among many other potentially important
terms, includes the following salient provisions:

I It ?provides a framework for a Crossing Authority established by Canada to design,
construct, ?nance, operate and maintain a new International Crossing between Canada

1

and Michigan, under the oversight of a jointly established International Authority with
three members appointed by Canada and the Crossing Authority and three members
appointed by the Michigan Parties, and with funding approved by Canada, but with no
funding by the Michigan Parties." (P. 

It provides a concise summary of the history of the GHIB project (P. 
It states the purpose of the agreement (Pp. 

It identi?es the parties to the agreement: Canada, the Crossing Authority, Michigan, the
Michigan Department of Transportation. and the Michigan Strategic Fund (Pp. 

It broadly defines ?Applicable Law? as ?in respect of any Person, property,
transaction, event or other matter, as applicable, all present or future (except as
otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement) Law relating or applicable to
that Person, property, transaction, event or other matter.? (P. 4) (emphasis added)

It once again broadly de?nes ?Governmental Authority? as ?any domestic or
foreign government, including any federal, provincial, state, territorial or municipal
government, and any government, agency, tribunal, commission or other authority
exercising executive, legislative, judicial, regulatory or administrative functions of, or
pertaining to, such goveminent.? (P. 7) (emphasis added)

It further broadly defines ?Law? as ?all laws (including common law), lay-laws,
ordinances, rules, statutes, regulations, treaties, ord ers, rules, judgments and decrees, and
all of?cial directives, rules, guidelines, notices, approvals, orders. policies and other
requirements of any Governmental Authority, having the force of law, and shall
include, with respect to the applicability of state law to the internal operations of the
International Authority, the legal doctrine and principles developed in judicial decisions
involving entities formed under an agreement entered into pursuant to Section 10 of
Article 1 of the US Constitution.? (P. 8} (emphasis added)

It provides that ?The internal governance, activities and operations of the international
Authority, including meetings, deliberations and decisions of the International Authority.
and all information related thereto, shall be subject to and governed by Applicable
(P. 15)

it states that ?The Crossing Authority shall be responsible for International Crossing
Project Activities (along with other speci?ed activities] and shall be responsible for the
design, construction, ?nancing, operation and maintenance o'fthe International Crossing,
in compliance with Applicable Law. . (P. 25) (emphasis added);

It requires that ?Any Claim by a third party against the Crossing Authority arising out of
any one or more of the design, construction and ?nancing of the Michigan Crossing. the
Michigan interchange or the US Federal Plaza and any Claim by a third party against the
Crossing Authority arising out of any one or more of the administration, operation,

2

maintenance and improvement of the Michigan Crossing or the US Federal Plaza shall
be made in Michigan courts having jurisdiction over the Claim or in federal courts sitting
in Michigan having jurisdiction over the Claim, as the case may be.? (P. 31);

0 Section XV, ?Governing Law?, states: ?The provisions of this Agreement with respect
to the authorization and execution of this Agreement by the Michigan Parties, the
establishment of the International Authority and the interpretation of any
provisions of the Laws of Michigan and the Laws of the United States of America
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of Michigan and
the Laws of the United States of America. All other provisions of this Agreement shall
be construed in accordance with the Laws of the Province of Ontario and the Laws of
Canada. No provision of this Agreement shall be construed as a waiver of governmental
or sovereign immunity by Canada or Michigan.? (P. 36) (emphasis added);

reading of the above provisions of the Crossing Agreement, in light of the purposes and
factual context of the GHIB international crossing project, is that local laws will continue to apply
to the extent possible and consistent with the objectives of the WDBA and the project. The failure
to omit local laws from the de?nition of ?Applicable Law?, or to omit local government from the
de?nition of ?Governmental Authority?, together with the requirement that 
activities must be govemed by Applicable Law, seems to indicate the inclusion of local laws in
governance of this major project?s activities, where applicable.

In order to enforce rights under such local laws in the United States, third parties would have to
?le suit in state or federal court. (Parties to the Crossing Agreement are required to submit their
disputes, if any, to binding arbitration.) The inclusion of the ?Laws of Michigan? as Governing
Law for purposes ofthis project and the Crossing Agreement should, in opinion, include
local laws, which are part of Michigan law. LPD notes however, that this conclusion is 1) highly
fact-speci?c, dependent on the particular features of any given factual context; and 2) there is no
guarantee that any given court would necessarily agree in each and every speci?c case that any
particular local law must govern every aspect of this major international project, in any foreseeable
individual case. The ultimate detennination must await speci?c factual development of disputed
issues, if any.

Timely and Accurate May);

The Director of Stakeholder Relations for the bridge authority was kind enough to provide us with
the attached maps.

Pursuant to a Leases and Services Agreement dated June 19, 2017, the City leased 27 parcels of
property, comprising a total of approximately 34.04 acres, to the authority for a terms of seven
years. Also on tine l9, 2017, the City and the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT)
entered into a Jurisdictional Transfer Agreement. transferring jurisdictional control of certain
speci?ed road and alley segments for use in construction oi?the bridge. Sections and (Pp. 3-
3) of that agreement specify four speci?c rights-of?way (ROW) that shall acquire and
dedicate to the City", followed by seven speci?ed routes to which MDOT will direct construction
traf?c.

At Council Member Castaneda-Lopez?s request, LPD recontacted the bridge authority?s public
affairs division and asked what the authority?s position is, if any, regarding the possible assertion
of local government land use regulation powers via zoning amendments. LPD was advised that
they will consult their legal representatives regarding that question, and that it will take some time
for them to respond of?cially. In the event that LPD receives a further response, Council will be
advised.

If Council has any other questions or concerns regarding this subject, LPD will be happy to provide
further research and analysis upon request.

businesses of the following uses:

- Used motor vehicle storage or sales lots;

RE: Resolution in Support of the ?Bullet Bill?

 

I am requesting the Legislative Policy Division to craft a resolution in support of the
Bullet Bill proposed by Wayne County Commissioner Reggie Davis.

The Bullet Bill would require a mental health background check as a prerequisite for
purchasing ammunition. Further, the bill would establish the practice of buying and
selling ammunition from a law enforcement agency.

See attached draft resolution from the Wayne County Commissioners.

To the Clerk, please line item this in the Public Health and Safety Standing Committee.

Thank you,
