RE: HONORABLE CITY COUNCIL

RE: The request to repeal Ordinance No. 26-18 and replace with a corrective ordinance
for the project that was approved in 2018 for American Community Developers, Inc.
to modify the provisions of an existing PD-H (Flamed Development-Historic) zoning
classi?cation on Article XVII District Map 4 of the 1984 Detroit City Code, Chapter
61, Zoning, on land bounded by Brush Street on the west, Watson Street on the north,
Beaubien Street on the east and Wilkins Street on the south in order to allow for a
three-building mixed-use development with below-grade parking. (RECOMMEND
APPROVAL)

REQUEST

This request is to repeal Ordinance No. 26-18 and replace with a corrective ordinance that is now
before Your Honorable Body. The original ordinance that was laid on the table on October 30,
2018, was for the request to modify the provisions of an existing PD-H (Flamed Development-
Historic) zoning classi?cation on Article XVII District Map 4 of the 1984 Detroit City Code,
Chapter 61, Zoning, on land bounded by Brush Street on the west, Watson Street on the north,
Beaubien Street on the east and Wilkins Street on the south in order to allow for a three-building
mixed-use development with below- grade parking.

Ordinance No. 26-18 that was approved in 2018, omitted two private parcels that were a part of
the development project site along with nine additional public parcels that were included in the
ordinance.

The two parcels that were omitted are within the same city block adjacent to the public parcels
that are included in the original ordinance. The two private parcels, although omitted from the
original ordinance, were described in the public hearing notice and presentations that were
considered by Your Honorable Body.

City Planning Commission staff has worked with the Law Department to correct the de?cient
ordinance (Attached). No other details of the originally approved project would change as a
result of this correction. For details of the project, please see below.

BACKGROUND

In October 2018, American Community Developers, Inc. (ACD) requested to modify the
provisions of an existing PD-H zoning classi?cation on land bounded by Brush Street on the
west, Watson Street on the north, Beaubien Street on the east and Wilkins Street on the south in
order to allow for a three?building mixed-use development with below-grade parking.

The subject site is an entire city block that exists as a grassy open space, void of any structures
and is approximately 1.42 acres in area, consisting of 11 parcels. Of those 11 parcels, two are
currently owned by the developer and the remainder are under control of the City and are to be
subject of a development agreement with ACD, which was awarded the site after responding to
the City?s Request for Proposals (RFP). The subject site is located within the Brush Park Historic
District.

PROPOSAL

The proposed development calls for the construction of three multi?story buildings with one level
of below grade parking providing approximately 160 spaces with an additional seven spaces
above grade level. The Brush Street building (?ve?stories totaling 65 feet in height) will be
roughly 56,000 sf and the Beaubien Street building (four-stories totaling, 45 feet in height) will
be roughly 45,000 sf while the mid-block building (three-stories- 35 feet in height) is roughly
35,000 sf. The underground parking is planned to be 62,000 sf.

The structures would include retail/commercial space in the Brush and Beaubien buildings. A
promenade is planned to run through the middle of the site for short term parking for retail and
also for other brief trips. ACD will be marketing the commercial space as a neighborhood market
with a cafe (8,000-10,000 sf), but if a suitable market can?t be found, the space will be marketed
as neighborhood commercial/retail and/or restaurant use. There would be seven surface short
term parking spaces at rear along the promenade for retail. Signage would be in place to limit
these spaces to 30 minutes to encourage tum-over. The southwest corner of Brush and Wilkins
would possibly be a cafe and include outdoor seating.

Below?grade parking would be accessed by a ramp at the mid-block. The underground parking is
planned to be shared among the residential and retail users through a managed parking system.
Residents would have keycard access. Retail users will have to take a ticket to be validated at the
retail establishments. Amenities will include a dog park, fitness room, conference room,

concierge system, indoor lounge and a rooftop patio.

The project will contain approximately 180 apartment units ranging from 63 ef?ciency units, 81
1-bedroom units and 36 2-bedroom units. Of the 180 units that are designated as affordable, 45
units are planned to reach the 30% -60% area median income 45 units are planned to
reach the 80% AMI, leaving 90 units at market rate value.

The lighting and security plan for the site includes pole mounted ?xtures, lighting at bollards and
along each building. Buildings will be secured with card reader access for residents and security
cameras will be placed around the buildings for full site coverage.

intended to promote economic growth for the bene?t of the residents of the City and all
taxing units located within and bene?ted by the DBRA.

This Plan is intended to apply to the eligible property identi?ed in this Plan and, if tax

Petit Bateau LLC (?Developer?) is the project developer. Developer intends to prepare the
Property for the construction of a ?ve (5) story mixed-use building (?East Building?), a
four (4) story mixed-use building (?West Building?) and approximately twenty (20)
residential townhomes, along with associated site improvements (the ?Project?). The
Project will include a total of approximately eighty-?ve (85) units with the East Building
containing approximately thirty-nine (39) units with approximately 3,200 SF of
commercial space, the West Building containing approximately twenty-six (26) units, and
approximately twenty (20) townhome units.

It is currently anticipated construction will begin in the fall of 2019 and eligible activities
will be completed within 3?6 months from the commencement of construction. The project
description provided herein is a summary of the proposed development at the time of the
adoption of the Plan. The actual development may vary from the project description
provided herein, without necessitating an amendment to this Plan, so long as such
variations are not material and arise as a result of changes in market and/or ?nancing
conditions affecting the Project and/or are related to the addition or immaterial removal of
amenities to the Project. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, all
material changes, as determined by DBRA in its sole discretion, to the project description
are subject to the approval of the DBRA staff and shall be consistent with the overall nature
of the proposed development, its proposed public purpose, and the purposes of Act 381.

Attachment provides a description of the Project to be completed at the Property and
Attachment includes letters of support for the Project.

B. Basis ofEligibilitv (Section 13 (2)91) and Section 2 

Except for the 511 Frederick parcel, the balance of the Property is considered ?eligible
property? as de?ned by Act 381, Section 2 because the Property was previously utilized
for a commercial, industrial, public, or residential purpose; it is located within the City
of Detroit, a quali?ed local governmental unit under Act 381; and the Property was
determined to be a ?facility? as de?ned by Act 381. The 511 Frederick parcel is adjacent
and contiguous to the balance of the Property and is also considered ?eligible property.?

The Property is considered ?eligible property? as de?ned by Act 381, Section 2 due to the
presence of arsenic, chromium and selenium in the soil above the EGLE Part
201 Generic Cleanup Criteria (GCC), as well as the 511 Frederick parcel being adjacent
and contiguous. Therefore, based on the results of the analytical sampling, the Property is
classi?ed as a ?facility? under Part 2010f the Natural Resources and Environmental
Protection Act, 451 RA. 1994, as amended (?Act 451?). The individual parcels may be
combined at a later date during the development process. Attachment includes a
con?rmation of the ?facility? status.

C. Summanr of Eligible Activities and Description of Costs (Section 13 
The ?eligible activities? that are intended to be carried out at the Property are considered
?eligible activities? as de?ned by Section 2 of Act 381, because they include baseline

environmental assessment activities, demolition, lead and asbestos abatement, department
speci?c activities, site preparation, infrastructure improvements, and the development and
preparation of brown?eld plan and work plan.

A summary of the eligible activities and the estimated cost of each eligible activity intended
to be paid for with tax increment revenues from the Property are shown in the table attached
hereto as Attachment E. The eligible activities described in Attachment are not
exhaustive. Subject to the approval of DBRA staff in writing, additional eligible activities
may be carried out at the Property, without requiring an amendment to this Plan, so long
as such eligible activities are permitted by Act 381 and the cost of such eligible activities
does not exceed the total costs stated in Attachment E.

Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the DBRA, all eligible activities shall commence
within eighteen (18) months after the date the governing body approves this Plan and will
be completed within three (3) years after approval of the Michigan Strategic Fund 
work plan, if applicable, or three (3) years after execution of the Reimbursement
Agreement (as that term is de?ned below), whichever is later. Any long-term monitoring
or operation and maintenance activities or obligations that may be required will be
performed in compliance with the terms of this Plan and any documents prepared pursuant
to this Plan.

The Developer desires to be reimbursed for the costs of eligible activities incurred by it as
described below. Some eligible activities may commence prior to the adoption of this Plan
and to the extent permitted by Act 381 shall be reimbursable pursuant to the
Reimbursement Agreement. Tax increment revenue generated by the Property will be
captured by the DBRA and used to reimburse the cost of the eligible activities completed
on the Property pursuant to the terms of a Reimbursement Agreement to be executed by
the DBRA and the Developer after approval of this Plan (the ?Reimbursement
Agreement?), to the extent permitted by Act 381.

In the event this Plan contemplates the capture of tax increment revenue derived from
?taxes levied for school operating purposes? (as de?ned by Section 2(uu) of Act 381 and
hereinafter referred to as ?School Taxes?), the Developer acknowledges and agrees that
obligation to reimburse the Developer for the cost of eligible activities with tax
increment revenue derived from Local Taxes, or Speci?c Taxes that are considered Local
Taxes, (as these capitalized terms are de?ned by Act 381) is contingent upon: the
Developer receiving at least the initial applicable work plan approvals by the MSF and the
Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy as may be
required pursuant to Act 381, within 180 days after the date this Plan is approved by the
governing body, or such other date as the DBRA may agree to in writing or (ii) the
Developer providing the DBRA with evidence, satisfactory to DBRA, that the Developer
has the ?nancial means to complete the project without the capture of, and subsequent
reimbursement with, the contemplated School Taxes.

The costs listed in Attachment are estimated costs and may increase or decrease
depending on the nature and extent of any environmental contamination and other
unknown conditions encountered on the Property. The actual cost of those eligible
activities encompassed by this Plan that will qualify for reimbursement from tax increment

revenues of the DBRA from the Property shall be governed by the terms of the
Reimbursement Agreement. No costs of eligible activities will be quali?ed for
reimbursement except to the extent permitted in accordance with the terms and conditions
of the Reimbursement Agreement and Act 381. The Reimbursement Agreement and this
Plan will dictate the total cost of eligible activities subject to payment, provided that the
total cost of eligible activities subject to payment or reimbursement under the
Reimbursement Agreement shall not exceed the estimated costs set forth in Attachment E.
As long as the total costs are not exceeded, line item costs of eligible activities may be
adjusted after the date this Plan is approved by the governing body, to the extent the
adjustments do not violate the terms of the approved EGLE or the MSF work plans.

Dear Mr. Bateau,

I am pleased to write this letter of support for the Petit Bateau housing development on
Frederick street in the Art Center district of Midtown Detroit. Your track record in providing
quality housing in this neighborhood is extremely strong and your efforts have in large part
been responsible for much of the investment that is continuing today in this historic section of
Detroit.

I am very supportiVe of this project as it will bring additional need density to a neighborhood
that is extremely desirable given its unique set of assets including museums, schools and day
care facilities. This project represents a ful?llment of the hopes previous developments as well
as state and local governments, that prior work would be a catalyst for this infill development
to complete the block. Although some of the housing built recently in the neighborhood have
incorporated an affordable component, more moderate income developments are needed to
maintain the diversity of the Art Center area.

i wish you the best of luck with this project.

RE: Wayne County Support for Petit Bateau Development Project
Dear Mr. Vosburg,

On behalf of the Wayne County Economic Development Corporation (WCEDC) and the
Wayne County Brownfield Redevelopment Authority (WCBRA), I am writing to offer our
support of this project. We are excited by the opportunity to support the Petit Bateau as it
works to redevelop this brownfield property in the City of Detroit, creating improved
environmental conditions as well as jobs and affordable homes. In addition, the WCBRA has
continuing discussions to possibly provide low?interest loans to help support this project
financially through its Revolving Loan Fund. We have worked with Julio Bateau in the past
and find him to be a positive actor in the community and a capable developer for projects
such as this one.

We look forward to working with you and with Petit Bateau LLC to see this project
completed. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Honorable City Council:

Please accept this letter as a request to establish an Obsolete Property Rehabilitation
Development District for the property located at 511 Woodward and described on

Attachment A.
District Description

The ?Dream 511? project involves the rehabilitation of the vacant and obsolete building
located at 511 Woodward for commercial and retail uses.

Parcel Information

 

 

Address Parcel 3 OwnethTf Record ql Acreage _j

 

 

 

511 Woodward 02001900-9 Wayne County Land Bank .186 

 

The current 30,240 square foot building was constructed in 1972. The building is a four
(4) story glass curtain wall building on three (3) sides with a brick and block center
section over the building entry with a block and brick rear side. The building was
originally occupied by various professional of?ces and a ?nancial institution from 1973
until at least 2006, when the building was vacated. The building has been vacant and

unutilized since 2006.

Project Start and Completion Date

Pursuant to a Purchase and Development Agreement executed on April 1, 2019 between
Wayne County, the Wayne County Land Bank, and 1, LLC, the property at
511 Woodward is being purchased from the Land Bank by LLC, an entity
which has been established for the project. The purchase is slated to close in September,
2019. Construction will begin immediately and follow a ?fteen-month schedule to

completion.

Purpose for Renovation of 511 Woodward

The building is currently cleared out down to the building structural elements.
Renovation of the building is essential for removal of functionally obsolescent existing
building elements. Most of these elements revolve around building core and facade

elements.

Current building code requires the building to have ?re suppression, alarm and exit
devices installed prior to occupancy. Electrical systems need to be updated to support
600arnps/?oor of service as well as ensuring the electrical service room provides
adequate operational room. The existing electrical room will be recon?gured to meet the

current code requirements.

The elevator needs to be certi?ed and approved by the City prior to use. Updates to the
elevator will be speci?ed to enhance its appearance to match the Class A Lobby

renovations that are proposed.

Existing exterior curtain wall systems need to be upgraded to meet current energy codes
and provide a value of .25 - .27 with shading coef?cient of .70 on the upper ?oors. The
new curtain wall and proposed screen wall will provide an energy ef?cient exterior wall

system.

Bene?ts to the Community

Dream 511 represents the expansion of a partnership between The Elia Group and the
Downtown Detroit Partnership (DDP), which includes a strong track record transforming
under-utilized downtown parcels into vibrant community parks, restaurants and
landmarks. The organizations collaborated to create Parc Restaurant, which has received
local and national critical acclaim since opening in 2016, serving as a reputable anchor in
arguably the most iconic location in Downtown Detroit: Campus Martins. Additionally,
they created The Fountain Detroit, a 340?square-foot restaurant that brought one of the
?rst adaptive reuses of old shipping containers in Detroit to Campus Martius.

The partnership is also a driving force in activating Campus Martius as an all-season
community gathering space, operating the Rink Side Bar and Arctic Zone concession
areas, which ?ank the ice rink during the winter months, and providing free live
entertainment to visitors and families all year long.

The Elia Group-.DDP team remains committed to providing opportunities for workforce
training, growth and employment in Detroit. This is exempli?ed through their
relationship with programs such as the city?s Grow Detroit?s Young Talent program,
from which several graduates have been hired at The Fountain Detroit restaurant.

The Dream 511 project will produce a minimum of 75 construction jobs, one-third of
which are anticipated to be speci?c to low-income Wayne County residents. The new
space will allow for the hiring of approximately 100 new retail and of?ce employees in
Downtown Detroit. One Property Manager will be hired directly by the new Owner. The
Purchase and Development Agreement contains community bene?t requirements that

will be monitored by Wayne County.

headquarters will anchor the space. support of workforce development
and creative talent are central to its mission. For example, many of Downtown
Detroit Business Improvement Zone (BIZ) Clean and Hospitality Ambassadors are
referred through ?second chance? programs such as Goodwill Industries of Detroit, and
DDP provides wraparound services to facilitate the success of this initiative. 
landscape vendor utilizes the Greening of Detroit and its training programs. DDP served
as the ?duciary for the launch of the Grow Detroit?s Young Talent program at the request
of Mayor Duggan and engages the region?s creative talent to perform in Downtown

public spaces.

The rehabilitation of the facility would not be undertaken without the applicant's receipt
of the exemption certi?cate. This exemption will allow a reduced rental rate for DDP, a
nonpro?t organization. Without this exemption, DDP would not be able to create the
Welcome Center and continue to provide their ongoing programming and services in the
Downtown area. Therefore, the Obsolete Property Rehabilitation Certi?cate is requested
for the full twelve years allowed by statute.

Eligibility

The current building, constructed in 1972, is ?functionally obsolete? far the commercial
uses it was originally intended for. Changes in technology and building code require a
complete replacement of major heating, cooling and electrical systems in the building.

Property Ownership

The Wayne County Land Bank currently owns the property located at 511 Woodward.
The sale to 1, LLC is slated to close in September 2019.

Total Capital Investment

The Purchase and Development Agreement contains minimum investment requirements
that will be monitored by Wayne County. Under these terms, ICONIC-51 1, LLC will
invest at minimum $4.5 million into the property, an amount that increases under certain

circumstances to $7 million.

Re: Obsolete Property Rehabilitation District Wayne County Land Bank

Parcel Number: 02001900?9

Dear Mr. Cox:

The Office of the Chief Financial Officer, Office ofthe Assessor, has reviewed the proposed Obsolete Property Rehabilitation
District located at 511 Woodward in the Downtown area in the City of Detroit.

The rationale for creating Obsolete Property Rehabilitation Districts under PA 146 of 2000, as amended, is based on the
anticipation of increased market value upon completion of new construction and /or significant rehabilitation of existing
commercial property and commercial housing property. Normal repair and maintenance are not assessed and do not
necessarily generate additional market value.

Pursuant to a purchase and development agreement with LLC, the developer plans to rehabilitate the four-
story, 30,240 square foot office building, built in 1972 on .186 acres of land. The building has been vacant an unutilized
since 2006 and clear out down to the building structural elements. Rehabilitation will include a new fire suppression
system, updating the electrical system, updating the elevators to code, and a new curtain wall and proposed screen wall to
provide an energy efficient exterior wall system.

This property meets the criteria set forth under PA 146 of 2000, as amended. It applies to blighted, functionally obsolete
and contaminated properties. "Rehabilitation," meaning that changes to qualified facilities that are required to restore or
modify the property, together with all appurtenances, to an economically efficient condition. Rehabilitation also includes
deficient or excessive height, new or improved fixed building equipment, including heating, ventilation, and lighting,
reducing multistory facilities to 1 or 2 stories, adding additional stories to a facility or adding additional space on the same
floor level not to exceed 100% of the existing floor space on that floor level, improved structural support including
foundations, improved roof structure and cover, floor replacement, improved wall placement, improved exterior and
interior appearance of buildings, and other physical changes required to restore or change the obsolete property to an
economically efficient condition.

A field investigation indicated that the proposed Obsolete Property Rehabilitation District located at 511 Woodward is eligible
as it pertains to the Obsolete Property Rehabilitation Act under PA 146 of 2000, as amended.

Elmwood Club Plaza
April 24, 2019

I. General Description of Obsolete Facility and Description of the Obsolete Facility?s
Proposed Use

The Elmwood Club Plaza is an approximately 111,100 leasable square foot apartment
building, constructed in the 19705, and contains 202 units within its 18 stories. The facility is
obsolete because its heating and cooling systems are inadequate for the highest and best use of
the property; (ii) the electrical, plumbing, mechanical, and interior features are inef?cient and
inconsistent with the highest and best use of the property; and the interior and exterior
components are de?cient, requiring repairs, restoration, and modernization.

Upon completion of the rehabilitation, the Elmwood Club Plaza will retain all 202 units.
It will also add brand new high-ef?ciency mechanical systems, air conditioning for all residents,
exterior cladding, high ef?ciency windows, modernized elevators, an upgraded life safety and
sprinkler system, a fully amenitized outdoor green area added at the base of the building, and an
upgraded retail facade along Chene.

II. Description of the General Nature and Extent of the Rehabilitation to be
Undertaken

The rehabilitation will include the following major aspects:

Rehabilitation of the interior units.

Removal and replacement of heating system with modern, ef?cient heating units.
Removal and replacement of windows with high ef?ciency windows.

Addition of air conditioning for all units.

Upgraded life safety system, including sprinklers.

Rehabilitation of the facade.

Rehabilitation of the ?rst floor lobby.

Additional outdoor amenities and improved commercial facade.

Descriptive List of the Fixed Building Equipment That Will Be Part of the
Rehabilitated Facility

HV AC, dishwashers, elevators and other customary equipment located in apartment

IV. Time Schedule for Undertaking and Completing the Facility?s Rehabilitation

The rehabilitation of the ElmWOod Club Plaza is expected to commence in July 2019 and
be completed by August 2020.

V. Statement of the Economic Advantages Expected from the Exemption

The exemption will temporarily mitigate the very high real property tax rates in the City
of Detroit (approx. 85.622 mills), contribute toward a more affordable rent structure for the
Ehnwood Club Plaza and allow for offering of apartments that are affordable to people with
moderate income levels. This affordable rent structure will allow the achievement of higher
occupancy and accelerate the in?ux of nearby workers who want to work and live in the City of
Detroit, which will in turn increase the City of Detroit?s income tax collections from both
residents and construction workers. Approximately twenty (20) temporary construction jobs will
be created. Three (3) permanent, full-time employee positions are also expected to be created.

additional market value.

Elmwood Park Plaza Limited Partnership is proposing to rehabilitate the 18-story apartment building with 156,634 square feet of

of heating units, replacement of windows, air conditioning for all units, up-grade of the life safety system, rehabilitation of the
facade and rehabilitation ofthe first floor lobby.

RE: Request for the Establishment of an Obsolete Property Rehabilitation Act (OPRA)
District at 2119 Field Street, Detroit, Michigan 48214 for K8 Partners LLC

Honorable City Council:

Please accept this letter as a request to establish an Obsolete Property Rehabilitation District
(OPRD) for the property located at 2119 Field Street, Detroit, Michigan 48214. which is referred
to herein as the "Property" and described on Attachment A. The Property will be rehabilitated by
the petitioner and current owner. K8 Partners LLC.

Company and Project Synopsis

K8 Partners, LLC (the "Developer") was formed in 2018 and is affiliated with Astral Weeks
Development (?Astral Weeks?) Astral Weeks is a privately held real estate development and
management company, working primarily in the New York City region and Detroit. With a focus
on dynamic urban neighborhoods, Astral Weeks develops and invests in residential.
commercial. and mixed use projects. Whether through ground?up new construction or adaptive
reuse projects, the company contributes to the thriving neighborhoods in which its projects are
located by helping meet local demands for quality housing. community facilities. creative
workspaces, and retail. Because Astral Weeks owns, operates and manages its properties, the
company's approach to development is distinguished by strategic purpose and professional
execu?on.

Astral Weeks has been active in the City of Detroit since 2014, making several property
acquisitions. as well as executing on a 'nelghborhood development strategy in
lslandviewiGreater Villages. including the planned rehab of approximately 60 single family and
duplex homes, 15 of which have been completed and leased out or sold to date.

The Roy Company, the construction manager (CM), is a contracting firm based in Detroit, and a
dedicated partner for this development. With the experience of Astral Weeks and the dedication
of The Roy Company. the Developer is poised to successfully rehabilitate this historic building,
providing increased housing variety in an area of Detroit ripe for building rehabilitation and
increased residential density.

The proposed OPRD contains one parcel totaling approximately 0.34 acres and is located at
2119 Field Street, Detroit, Michigan. The proposed OPRD is bounded by the property line to the
north; Field Street to the east; Kercheval Avenue to the south: and the property line to the west.
The OPRD is located in the lslandview neighborhood of Detroit, named for its proximity to
Detroit?s famous island park, Belle Isle. Smart Bus routes are located within a block east or west
on Kercheval Avenue to provide transportation alternatives. Additionally, planned bike lanes
along Kercheval Avenue and the forthcoming Beltline Greenway will connect residents to local
amenities, provided increased ease of access to reach the riverfront and RiverWalk. The
property is occupied by a two-story multi-family residential building with basement currently

Request for Establishment of an Obsolete Property Rehabilitation District at
2119 Field Street, Detroit MI 48214
for K8 Partners LLC

containing approximately 11,980 square feet and constructed in 1910. The proposed
redevelopment will contain approximately 11.761 square feet of living space. not including an
additional 5.957 square feet of basement floor space. The building is currently uninhabitable.
with roof leaks. no windows or interior partitions. and no operating utilities.

The proposed OPRD will entail the rehabilitation of the current building into eight residential
townhome apartment units. Each unit will include modern three-bedroom floorplans and ?nishes
with private entry and exit for each unit, including covered porches that face the streets, and
rear porches that access private parking.

As part of the rehabilitation. the building will be gutted to receive new utilities including electrical.
water. and natural gas, new energy ef?cient heating. cooling and ventilation systems. new
energy efficient windows and doors, and insulation. repairs to building structure and masonry
will be completed as needed. and the interior wall partitions will receive new framing and finish
materials. including drywall. trim. new ?ooring, appliances. and fixtures. The structure will be
brought up to current code as applicable.

The Necessity for Tax Relief

Substantial investment is necessary to rehabilitate the area into a viable. long-term
development. Additionally. the property currently contains a dilapidated and deteriorating
building that will require repair and selective demolition with the property rehabilitation. The
overall internal rate of return for the proposed development will be extremely low without the
receipt of the Obsolete Property Rehabilitation District (and Certificate) and planned Brownfield
TIF Reimbursement. and therefore. the development would not be possible without it.

The costs associated with the rehabilitation require multiple capital sources including equity
contributed by K8 Partners LLC members. as well as an interim construction loan, and upon
completion. a long-term loan product In order to secure this ?nancing and future tenants, the
operating costs of the proposed renovations and redevelopment of the project need to be kept
as low as possible (including property taxes).

The proposed Development included within the request will result in approximately 73
construction Jobs and four full-time equivalent jobs associated with the ongoing
management and maintenance for the proposed residential development.

PA 146 Request
A 12-year abatement is being requested.
Economic Advantages of the Rehabilitation

Upon completion. the Development will return an obsolete property to productive use and will
increase residential density in an area characterized by vacant land and disinvestment.
Activation of this property will spur further growth and act as a catalyst for future redevelopment
of numerous vacant and blighted properties along the Kercheval Avenue corridor and the
surrounding neighborhoods and provide spinoff consumer spending in an area of Detroit that is
currently left out of redevelopment planning.

Request for Establishment of an Obsolete Property Rehabilitation District at
21 19 Field Street, Detroit MI 48214
for K8 Partners LLC

The granting of the OPRA tax abatement will not result in any fewer taxes to the City of Detrort
in the shorthterm or long-term. On a short-term basis approxrmately 7?3 construction jobs will be
created. The GC has several Detroit-based contractors that they have used in the past and that
they have requested bids from to ensure Detroit-based contractors and workers benefit from the
redevelopment. In addition. should additional contractors be needed for the project, the
Developer will reach out to the Skilled Trades Taskforce and/or attend D2D meetings to ensure
Detroit-based contractors benefit from the development.

Upon successful redevelopment. the proposed redevelopment will create approximately four
full-time equivalent (FTE) jobs related to the management and maintenance of the property.
These new jobs, along with the new residents living at the development. will generate increased
income taxes for the City of Detroit.

Following expiration of the 12-year abatement the building will deliver a significant increase in
tax revenue. Over time, the successful redevelopment and cultural growth will have a city?wide
impact.

Closing

K8 Partners LLC are a group of experienced professionals driven to redevelop dynamic urban
neighborhoods just like lslandview. Through diligent development planning, K8 Partners LLC
are poised to succeed with this multi?family investment in the City of Detroit.

Members of the Development team are planning to'reach out to local community groups, such
as the Villages Community Development Corporation and the local Detroit City Council member
regarding the new ownership and anticipated improvements to receive meaningful feedback on
the anticipated project.

The team is looking forward to pursuing this redevelopment and creating a community in
Detroit?s lslandview Neighborhood.

Statement of Economic Advantages

The proposed Development will bring needed investment to a residential area of Detroit's
lslandview neighborhood characterized by vacancy and blight. Primary planning goals for
lslandview include improving existing housing, increasing affordable housing options, increasing
the variety of housing, and increasing overall resident density. The Development will address
each of these goals by returning an obsolete property to the housing market and increasing
density within the neighborhood. Further, the Development is located just one-quarter mile
southwest of the Butzel Family Center where families can seek social services and self-help
technologies designed to improve their quality of life. Offering amenities such as a computer lab,
banquet hall, basketball court, baseball diamonds, tennis courts, and a playscape, Butzel Family
Center has much to offer future tenants of the Development. Indeed, activation of this property
along the Kercheval Avenue corridor will spur further growth and infill development, acting as a
catalyst for future redevelopment of similar properties along Kercheval Avenue and throughout
the lslandview neighborhood.

The granting of the tax abatement will not result in any fewer taxes to the City of Detroit in the
short-term or long?term. Upon successful redevelopment, the Development will generate
increased income taxes, through the newjobs and residents that the project will create.

On a short-term basis approximately 73 construction jobs will be created (12.64 full-time
equivalent The Roy Group, the construction manager (CM), has experience and contacts
to hire Detroit-based subcontractors and have reached out to the Skilled Trades Taskforce in
order to ensure Detroit-based contractors bene?t from the development.

Attachment A
Page 4 of 5

On a long-term basis the proposed redevelopment associated with the District will create
approximately four FTE jobs and house at least eight new Detroit residents. Therefore. it is
anticipated the City of Detroit will collect approximately 2.4% income tax per resident per year.
The table below illustrates the residenttax impact the development will have following completion.

ggtal i 

Additionally, there will be other indirect benefits such as spin off spending in the City that will
contribute to the economic bene?ts produced by this investment. It will further help meet the
demand for housing in Detroit, with a reported 2.6% vacancy rate across metro Detroit (Crain?s,
5/13/17). As one often neighborhoods targeted by Detroit's second Strategic Neighborhood Fund,
several hundred residential units and thousands of square feet of retail space are planned for
lslandview (Crain?s, 11/16/2018). These investments into the community will have long?term
effects and provide sustainable principals that will retain and foster local talent that is vital to
securing the City?s economic future.

Following expiration of the 12-year abatement the building will deliver a significant increase in tax
revenue. Over time, the successful redevelopment and cultural growth will have a city-wide

impact.

15007454009, 15007454010. New Parcel Number 15007454.002L for 2020 Assessment Roll.

Dear Mr. Cox:

The Of?ce of the Chief Financial Of?cer, Office of the Assessor, has reviewed the proposed Obsolete Property Rehabilitation
District located at 2119 Field Street in the Islandview neighborhood in the City of Detroit.

The rationale for creating Obsolete Property Rehabilitation Districts under PA 146 of 2000, as amended, is based on the
anticipation of increased market value upon completion of new construction and /or significant rehabilitation of existing
commercial property and commercial housing property. Normal repair and maintenance are not assessed and do not
necessarily generate additional market value.

K8 Partners plans to rehabilitate the two-story, 11,890 square foot, apartment building with a 5,951 square foot basement
built in 1910 on .344 acres of land into 8 residential townhome apartments with 3 bedroom. The units were formerly
condominiums and the condominium plan was dissolved for the 2020 assessment roll. The building is currently
uninhabitable with roof leaks, no windows, no interior partitions and no operating utilities. Rehabilitation will include
gutting the building, repairs to building structure, new windows, new interior walls, repairing the roof, new mechanical,
plumbing and electrical systems, and energy efficient heating, cooling and ventilation systems along with new apartment
fixtures for 8 residential units.

This property meets the criteria set forth under PA 146 of 2000, as amended. It applies to blighted, functionally obsolete
and contaminated properties. "Rehabilitation," meaning that changes to qualified facilities that are required to restore or
modify the property, together with all appurtenances, to an economically efficient condition. Rehabilitation also includes
deficient or excessive height, new or improved fixed b'uildinr equipment, including heating, ventilation, and lighting,
reducing multistory facilities to 1 or 2 stones, adding additii?al stories to a facility or adding additional space on the same

interpretation. The Petitioner is Epiphany Detroit LLC

Location and Project Proposal: 10103 Kercheval Avenue; The project proposes to adaptively reuse this
structure and redevelop it into mixed?use activities such as retail and commercial with some outdoor

programming.

Existing Site Information: The 3-story structure was built in 1925 by Epiphany Church to serve as their
community center. The structure has been unoccupied for many years. The subject site is zoned B4

(General Business District).

Surrounding Site Information
The immediate surrounding zoning along Kercheval is B4. To the immediate north is zoned R5 (Medium

Density Residential District). To the east, along Kercheval is a 2?story vacant commercial building. There
are vacant residential buildings to the north and west. Across Kercheval is a vacant lot, formerly a
parking lot. The Master Plan Future General Land Use designation for the surrounding area is also RLM.

Interpretation

impact on Surrounding Land Use

The proposed development will contribute to the development of Kercheval as a corridor serving the
adjacent residential area.

Impact on Transportation

There are DDOT routes one block to the west along Kercheval and 

Master Plan Interpretation

The subject site area Is designated Low/Medium Density Residential (RLM). Low/Medium Density
Residential areas should have an overall density of 8 to 16 dwelling units per net residential acre. The
areas are often characterized by two or four family homes with small yards, on-street parking, or
garages with alley access. The residential classifications allow for neighborhood-scale commercial
development. For instance, in a Low/Medium Density Residential area, small scale commerce 
convenience stores) should exist to serve residents's day-to-day needs. The Master Plan Future General
Land Use categories are generalized. Boundaries are not meant to be precise as to block or

 

 

Property lines. Categories are descriptive of general development recognizing that some intermixtures
are permissible or desirable. Most residential classifications allow for neighborhood-scale commercial

development.

The following policies of the FoCh neighborhood describe the following recommendations:
0 Policy 3.1: Develop neighborhood commercial nodes along Mack and Jefferson with a
compatible mix of locally serving, small-scale businesses and medium density residential along

the less viable sections
0 Policy 4.1: Strategically acquire property to be utilized for the development of neighborhood

parks and play lots

The proposed development does not change the Future General Land Use characteristics of
the area and conforms to various Master Plan policies.

.. - - increased mar'lie?t'lvaeru poncomple'tionof new construction and for significant rehabilitatiOn 
commercial housing property. Normal repair and maintenance are not assessed and do not necessarily generate additional market
value.

The proposed project by Epiphany Detroit LLC consists ofthe rehabilitation Ofa 3-story vacant community center with 27,084 square
feet built in 1925 on .201 acres of land into a mixed use structure with retail and commercial tenants. Rehabilitation activities
included roof repairs, ceiling and floor substructure repairs, brick and limestone repairs and replacement, new electric,
plumbing,HVAC, elevator and fire system and a new water main.

Neighborhood Advisory Committee Arena District 3
Executive Summary: 2014-2019 

September 19, 2019

 

Background: The Ilitch Family and Detroit Development

The Ilitch Family has been a fixture in Downtown
Detroit since they purchased the Detroit Red Wings
in 1982. A few years later, they acquired the Fox
Theatre, restoring it and reopening it as a
successful entertainment venue, while moving their
Little Caesars pizza headquarters from Farmington
to the Fox's adjoining office building. Over the next
decade, the family would spend hundreds of

millions more, acquiring the Detroit Tigers, securing
a majority ownership in Motor City Casino, and
building a real estate empire, snapping up hundreds
of properties, culminating in the opening of
Comerica Park, in the leadup to the 2000 Tigers
season. All of these corporate interests are owned
and controlled by llitch Holdings, valued at about $6
billion, and currently headed by Chris Ilitch, the son
of Little Caesars founders Mike and Marian Ilitch.

Pre-2014: Clearing the Way for the Detroit Events Center

For many years, Detroiters speculated that owner Mike Ilitch wanted to build a new hockey arena
for the Detroit Red Wings. In 2012 rumors began to swirl when Red Wings officials confirmed
that architects HKS and Chan Krieger were hired to design an 18,000 seat ?events center.? Initial
statements placed the facility behind the Fox Theatre, on land largely made up of surface parking
lots. Meanwhile, behind the scenes, Red Wings and the Ilitch?s real estate development arm,
Olympia Development of Michigan (ODM), were meeting with representatives from the Detroit
Economic Growth Corporation (DEGC) and Michigan State Legislature to put together a
financing package to construct the facility north of l-75, in the Lower Cass Corridor. By the time
state and local officials agreed to extend the boundaries of Detroit?s Downtown Development
Authority so Detroit taxes could be captured in a new ?Catalyst Area?, ODM was able to secure
nearly $300 million in public money. Despite the objection of Detroit legislators, there was little
by way of public disclosure or discussion on the matter in Lansing. Moreover, the timing of
negotiations and approvals at the local level for the land and a concessionaire agreement
coincided with Detroit?s bankruptcy the next year in 2013, effectively putting the State of
Michigan in control of the entire process. The 50-block area is now known as ?District Detroit.?

The IIitches Owns at Least 60% of the Properties in District Detroit

?mm What was less known at the time of the public announcement of
the Events Center location, was the extent of the llitch family land

holdings. Besides investing in the Fox, Comerica Park, and the
Events Center (renamed Little Caesars Arena in 2016), the
llitches planned major investment in parking infrastructure,
accounting for over half of the llitch-owned land. The llitches also
own vacant land and buildings, of which over 20 are in historic
districts, many languishing for decades. in May 2019, the Detroit
News published an overview of llitch-owned land in District
Detroit, noting the variety of LLCs the Hitches use, making

owned properties. Detroit News.

0: What is the Neighborhood Advisory Committee?

A: As a condition of Detroit City Council?s resolution to dispose of city-owned land for the Events Center,
a Neighborhood Advisory Committee (NAC) was formed in 2014, to exist for a term of 5 years, and made
up of a mix of 16 elected and council-appointed members. While the NAC was advisory, ODM had to
listen to its concerns and meet with the NAC, as needed. Since its start, the NAC has met and
held annual public meetings. The Arena NAC is a precursor to the current process followed by the
Community Benefits Ordinance (CBO), adopted in 2016.

0: What were Community Concerns and Requests to 

A: Prior to the formation of the NAC, the grassroots-led effort, Corridors
Alliance, had done some initial organizing in anticipation of the Events
Center, and completed surveys of the Lower Cass Corridor community,
including outreach to small businesses and residents. At the top of the list
of concerns was preventing the displacement of residents and businesses,
followed by traffic and parking, access to jobs and transit, preserving
historic structures, and affordable housing. These issues, among others,
were packaged in a formal request to Detroit City Council.

The NAC updated those requests in a ?District Vision" document delivered

 

Irk?v-wl-n-I 

to ODM in July 2014. It spelled out desires for a range of outcomes, from I .3, mm,
affordable housing, to construction impacts mitigation, to jobs,

entrepreneurship, green space, environment, and minimizing parking lots. 53%  



 

 

The NAC has tracked its requests and outcomes to date in a separate hut-?5?"
document, which also includes some of the subsequent issues and 
arisen overthe course of the NACs life. Another useful "5w 
document is the Lower Cass Corridor Community Needs Assessment, I'dea' 
which was also required by the original City Council resolution. It was 
finally released by the DDA in 2017, and offered a range of demographic,

quantitative, and survey analysis of the area, identifying, among other

things, a need to develop an in-district workforce.

NAC Issues Advocacy: 201 7-2019

      

Issue 3:

Issue 2:
Historic Preservation

Issue 1:
Affordable Housing

After Little Caesars Arena (LCA) officially opened in September 2017, NAC members agreed to focus
energy on three issues?Protecting Affordable Housing, Preserving Historic Structures, and
Traffic/Parking Mitigation. The NACs shifted from advice to public advocacy because it believed these
issues were being neglected by ODM and its recommendations had largely fallen on deaf ears.

Issue 1: Affordable Housing
In the years since ODM became a major property owner 
in District Detroit, there are fewer residential units, even .1
though ODM says housing is vital to District Detroit?s 
redevelopment vision. Moreover, ODM promised that the
District maintain 20% affordability, but has done little to

protect, invest in, or expand affordable housing that it . 

already controls, without any accountability.

This issue is most visible on Henry Street. Here, about 65
affordable units in two apartment buildings on one of the
last intact blocks of residential structures in District Detroit
were threatened when ODM pulled demo permits and
fought a subsequent proposed historic designation, telling
officials they wanted the block cleared for development.

Community Outcome: Cass-Henry Historic District
approved by City Council protects affordable housing.

Issue 2: Historic Preservation

The llitch family touts investing in the Fox Theatre as its
commitment to historic preservation. The truth is that
historically designated properties the Ilitches own are
more likely to end up vacant or demolished. Less than 5%
of llitch owned properties have been renovated.

After a controversial decision to demolish the Hotel Park
Avenue in 2015, ODM announced it would create 700+
residential units in several historic properties, including the
Alhambra and American Hotel. These were to join the
which ODM agreed to restore in a deal with
the City of Detroit. None of these projects are complete.

Community Outcome: City Council approved Cass Park
and Cass?Henry local historic districts protecting 27
structures; ODM agreed to $33 million bond with the City
of Detroit to ensure completion of the Hotel.

 

Alhambra, ODM retdering

Issue 3: Traffic/Parking

In contrast to selling low price pizza, the llitch business
model for Downtown Detroit is large scale, event-based
entertainment, meaning that management of vehicle
traffic and parking is paramount to its success. For LCA,
the llitch empire relies on measures that ensure patrons
can get to and from LCA easily, and maximizes its
returns on parking availability in the surrounding blocks.

I Traffic Management Plan

A Traffic Management Plan was completed in the lead
up to LCAs opening. Throughout District Detroit, it
focused traffic routes on tunneling ingress and egress
to freeways. In practice, this has caused disruption,
including blockage of bike lanes, the QLine, busses, and
has prevented patrons from accessing local businesses.

LCA is also the catalyst for the creation of thousands of
parking spaces, largely in surface lots. These
sit unused during much of the day, but can cost over
$40/space on events nights, with no fees going to the
City of Detroit. When asked, the llitches refused to
provide spaces to impacted residents.

Community Outcome: NAC convened ongoing local
business roundtab/e to discuss traffic issues with ODM,
Detroit Police, and Midtown Detroit inc. ODM
agreed to support prospective residential street parking
permit application With City of Detroit.

NAC Recommendations:

After five years, the NAC sees its work as
incomplete. There are so many opportunities to
improve the quality of life for Detroiters in District
Detroit, and we are sad that ODM and the llitch
Family chose not to be better community partners.

Fundamentally, the City of Detroit and local
community need continued advocacy and
accountability for neighborhood issues
outlined here and in the tracking doc, located on
the NAC's google site: DistrictDetroitNAC. Here
are some additional recommendations we see as
being relevant to success in District Detroit:

1. Accountability for existing affordable housing.

2. Enforcement of blight ordinance and post ODM
ownership information on vacant Hitch-owned
properties.

3. Divest portfolio to qualified affordable
housing developeris), such as Cass Corridor
Neighborhood Development Corp.

4. Increase investment in Cass Park.

5. Provide free day parking/OLine passes.

6. Support City of Detroit Historic Designation
Advisory Board communitywide survey.

7. Support continuing discussion on
impacts of traffic on local business.

8. Support Service Employee International
Union?s campaign for LCA service staff.
