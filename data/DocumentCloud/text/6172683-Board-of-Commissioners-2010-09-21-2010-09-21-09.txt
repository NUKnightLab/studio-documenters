 GENERAL BACKGROUND
As part of the Capital Improvement Program, the Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) solicited
bids to perform demolition work at LeClaire Courts Extension (IL2-015). LeClaire Courts
extends along the west side of South Cicero Avenue from 44th Street to 45th Street. The
structures to be demolished no longer serve a useful purpose and their demolition is needed as
part of the ongoing renovation of CHA developments under the Plan for Transformation. The
demolition work at LeClaire Courts Extension was split into several bid packages to provide
more contracting opportunities for vendors. Demolition, site work and landscaping is to be
completed within ninety (90) calendar days of the date set forth in the Notice to Proceed.
PROCUREMENT HISTORY
The CHA advertised Invitation for Bid (IFB) No. 10 – 00575 on July 27, 2010 for the demolition
of dwelling units at LeClaire Courts Extension – Group 2. The IFB was advertised in the
Chicago Sun-Times, the Chicago Defender and El Dia, and on the CHA website and at
BuySpeed Online. The pre-bid meeting and site visit were held on August 3, 2010. The CHA
issued Addendum No. 1 on August 12, 2010. This Addendum responded to Requests for
Information, distributed revised BF Pages, and replaced certain articles in the Special
Conditions. The CHA received and opened eight (8) bids on August 19, 2010 at 11:00 a.m.
After reviewing the bid submittal materials, the Department of Procurement and Contracts and
the Capital Construction Department held a pre-award survey meeting with the apparent lowest
bidder, McDonagh Demolition, Inc. The firm responded to questions on the thoroughness of its
bid and its capacity to perform this work. With the reviews, analysis and meetings completed, the
Department of Procurement and Contracts has determined that McDonagh Demolition, Inc. is the
lowest responsive and responsible bidder for Group1 at $408,790.00.
Based on the foregoing, it is in the CHA’s best interest for the Board of Commissioners to
authorize the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to execute a contract with McDonagh
Demolition, Inc. for demolition services at LeClaire Courts Extension – Group 2 for a firm fixed
fee of $408,790.00. The demolition work and associated site work and landscaping is to be
completed within ninety (90) calendar days of the date set forth in the Notice to Proceed.
This award is subject to the Contractor’s compliance with the CHA’s MBE/WBE/DBE, Section
3 resident hiring, and bonding and insurance requirements.
