and CHA residents, including: (1) to raise funds for new and ongoing resident initiatives (e.g., a
scholarship program); (2) as requested by CHA, to serve as fiscal agent to the CHA at the discretion of
its Board of Directors, and receive grants or contributions whose acceptance requires a not-for-profit
status or cooperative arrangement with a not-for-profit organization; (3) to form and maintain
partnerships/linkages with outside community groups, service providers, and funding sources; and (4) to

contract. In addition, the detailed reports shall be attached to all invoices submitted for payment by
