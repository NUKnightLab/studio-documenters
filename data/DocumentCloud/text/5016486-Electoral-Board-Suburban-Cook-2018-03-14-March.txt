PROPOSED RESOLUTION
CALLING FOR A MEETING OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE COMMITTEE TO INVESTIGATE
ISSUES SURROUNDING ELECTRONIC MONITORING
WHEREAS, Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart has communicated that too many violent offenders are being
released on electronic monitoring while awaiting trial, and
WHEREAS, Cook County has made significant strides in criminal justice reform that have resulted in a
much lower population at the Cook County Jail, and
WHEREAS, criminal justice reform is a crucial issue, but it must be approached in a common-sense matter,
and
WHEREAS, individuals accused of violent crimes deserve every civil right, but the County court system
should not be returning those accused of violent crimes to the streets at the cost of all other residents of the
County, and
WHEREAS, as more individuals are released on electronic monitoring instead of sitting in the County jail,
the Sheriff’s office must be given the resources necessary to appropriately keep track of those individuals,
and
WHEREAS, the County Board needs to be kept apprised of any issues surrounding criminal justice reform
because it is the fiduciary body of the jail and probation systems, and
WHEREAS, the State’s Attorney of Cook County, the Public Defender, the Sheriff and the Chief Judge of
the circuit court shall appear or send a representative to testify about this issue before the Criminal Justice
committee of the County Board.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the Cook County Board of Commissioners and the
President of the Board that representatives from the State’s Attorney’s Office, the Public Defender’s Office,
the Chief Judge’s Office, and the Sheriff’s Office shall appear before the Criminal Justice Committee to
discuss the issue of violent offenders being released on electronic monitoring.

A motion was made by Commissioner Boykin, seconded by Commissioner Morrison, that the
Resolution be referred to the Criminal Justice Committee. The motion carried.

PRESIDENT OF THE COOK COUNTY BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS
FOR THE LEVY OF TAXES FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2018
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners and the Committee on Finance of the Board of Commissioners
of Cook County, Illinois, have considered the subject of the Annual Tax Levy for the Fiscal Year A.D.,
2018, and the several sums necessary to be levied to meet the needs and requirements of the County of
Cook for said fiscal year, and have recommended that this Ordinance for the Levy of Taxes be adopted;
and
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of Cook County, Illinois, approved, passed, and adopted the
Annual Appropriation Bill of the County of Cook, for its Fiscal Year 2018, which said Appropriation Bill
is hereinafter set forth and which contains a Revenue Estimate that includes an allocation of the 2018 Tax
Levy by Fund together with additional columns captioned: “ANNUAL TAX LEVY”, “APPROPRIATION
ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTED TAXES” and "NET TAX LEVY FOR APPROPRIATION "; and
WHEREAS, Cook County and its taxpayers have benefited from Tax Increment Financing Districts (TIFs)
by having the increment generated during the life of the TIFs invest in the specific area generating the
increment; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board passed a Resolution on November 15, 2011 outlining that it is the
policy of Cook County to recapture any property taxes at the termination of a TIF; and
WHEREAS, within the County of Cook, certain real-estate parcels, or a portion of the assessed valuation
of certain real-estate parcels, are from time to time identified on the County real-estate tax rolls as deriving
from new property, insofar as they were developed or substantially improved or are the subject of tax
incentives that expired since the most recent assessment of real-estate taxes, the value of which has not
heretofore been recaptured; and
WHEREAS, the interests of County taxpayers and the County itself are better served if the taxes on the
additional value of said new property is captured.
THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED AND ORDERED BY THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF
COOK COUNTY, ILLINOIS, that pursuant to its home rule powers, $720,483,542.00 as a base levy
amount, plus a TIF value recapture sum of $17,582,624, an expiring incentives sum of $1,289,277, and a

from the Annual Tax Levy for the Fiscal Year A.D. 2018 of the County of Cook for the Public Safety Fund
purposes of said County, and for the Health Enterprise Fund purposes of said County, and for the payment
of principal and interest on general obligation bonds of said County as represented by the Bond and Interest
fund purposes, and for Cook County Employees Annuity and Benefit Fund purposes, and for the Election
Fund purposes, said aggregate amount being $761,983,039, which is the total amount of appropriations

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

property in the said County of Cook for the Fiscal Year 2018.
As provided in the Fiscal Year 2018 Annual Appropriation Bill, three percent of the property tax levy
revenues separately allocated to the Public Safety Fund, Health Enterprise Fund, and Election Fund are to
be made available to each Fund for purposes of covering the loss and cost of collecting taxes levied for
said Funds, for the amounts of taxes for which the nonpayment will result in forfeiture of real estate, and
for abatements in the amounts of such taxes as extended upon the collectors’ books. To ensure the County
meets its obligations for indebtedness as represented by the Bond and Interest Fund, and that the actual
collections of property taxes received by the Annuity and Benefit Fund are commensurate with the amounts
so levied, the County Clerk is authorized, in consultation with the County’s Chief Financial Officer, to
extend loss and collections for these funds in a manner that is sufficient for these purposes.
The specific amounts herein levied for the various purposes heretofore named are stated in this Ordinance
and Tax Levy, by being listed and itemized by Fund in the Revenue Estimate of the Annual Appropriation
Bill, including a column captioned: “ANNUAL TAX LEVY”. The tax hereby levied for said Fiscal Year
2018 for said appropriations, to be collected from this Levy, being the aforesaid total, consists of the

WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners has adopted a Real Property Assessment
Classification 6b that provides an applicant a reduction in the assessment level for an abandoned industrial
facility; and

buildings and other structures that, after having been vacant and unused for at least 24 continuous months,
have been purchased for value by a purchaser in whom the seller has no direct financial interest; and
WHEREAS, in the instance where the property does not meet the definition of abandoned property, the
municipality or the Board of Commissioners, may determine that special circumstances may exist that
justify finding that the property is abandoned for purpose of Class 6b; and
WHEREAS, in the case of abandonment of less than 24 months and purchase for value, by a purchaser in
whom the seller has no direct financial interest, the County may determine that special circumstances justify
finding the property is deemed abandoned; and
WHEREAS, Class 6b requires the validation by the County Board of the shortened period of qualifying
abandonment in cases where the facility has been abandoned for less than 24 consecutive months upon
purchase for value; and
WHEREAS, the municipality states the Class 6b is necessary for development to occur on this specific
real estate. The municipal resolution cites the qualifications of this property to meet the definition of
abandoned with special circumstances; and

Summary: In 2010, the Circuit Court of Cook County was awarded a Second Chance Act Reentry

Programs. The grant award of $547,673.00, spanned the period from 10/1/2010 - 9/30/2012. The entire
award amount was advanced but actual program costs were $520,791.62, with a remaining balance of

that expenses would ultimately be reallocated to the grant. However, that turned out not to be the case.

PROPERTY TAX INCENTIVE - PREVAILING WAGE REQUIREMENT
BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners, that Chapter 74 Taxation, Section 7471 of the Cook County Code is hereby amended as follows:
Sec. 74-71. - Laws regulating the payment of wages.
(a) Living wage requirement.
(1)

Unless expressly waived by the County Board, any Employer occupying a property that
receives a property tax incentive for Class 6b industrial property, Class 8 industrial
property, or Class 9 multifamily residential property shall pay not less than the Living
Wage, as defined in the Cook County Procurement Code (Cook County, Ill., Code, Ch. 34,
Art. IV, Div. 1 § 34-121), to each of its onsite Employees, unless such Employees' Wages
are governed by Federal or State prevailing wage law. For purpose of this Section, the term
"Employee" shall mean an Employee who performs duties or services for an Employer on
average at least 30 hours per week in any two-week period for which the Employee is paid;
"hours per week" shall mean hours for which an Employee is paid or entitled to payment
by the Employer for a period of time during which no duties are performed by the
Employee due to vacation, holiday, illness, incapacity, jury duty, military duty or approved
leave of absence.

(2)

On and after July 1, 2020, the owner of any property that receives a property tax incentive
shall notify all Employers who occupy such property as lessees of the requirements of this
Section. Upon commencement of a lease, on or after July 1, 2020, of a property that
receives a property tax incentive, any new lessee shall be required to submit to the
municipality or the Cook County Board, as the case may be, an affidavit stating that such
lessee is paying a Living Wage to its Employees in compliance with this Section.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the requirements of this Section shall not
apply to an Employer who was a lessee and not an owner-occupant of a property that
receives a property tax incentive prior to July 1, 2020.

(3)

This Section shall not apply to Employers that are not-for-profit organizations or funded
by Federal grants or Federal loans or Employers who are lessees but are not owners of a
property that receives a property tax incentive prior to adoption of this amended Ordinance.
Further, this Section shall not apply to Employers who can demonstrate to the County
Board that compliance with the requirements of this Section would cause such Employer
to be in violation of the terms of a collective bargaining agreement between the Employer
and a labor union.
69

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

March 14, 2018

(4)

Every Employer required to pay the Living Wage shall notify its Employees of the Living
Wage requirements and shall notify all of its Employees annually of any adjustment to the
Living Wage. In addition, the Employer shall notify its Employees that if any Employee
contends that the Employer is not paying a Living Wage or has otherwise violated this
section, that Employee may file a complaint with the Cook County Commissioner on
Human Rights ("Commission"). The Commissioner shall investigate alleged violations of
the Living Wage Ordinance and is authorized to adopt regulations for the proper
administration and enforcement of its provisions. If at the conclusion of the Commission's
investigation, the Commission finds that the Employer has violated this section, it shall (i)
in the case of an Employer receiving a property tax incentive, notify the Assessor; or (ii)
in the case of a Contractor or a subcontractor required to pay the Living Wage, notify the
CPO, who shall exercise such remedies as are in the best interest of the County, including
ordering the Employer to pay back pay and penalties, as provided in this section.

(5)

If an Employer is found to be in violation of this section, such Employer may be required
to pay back pay to each affected Employee, and may also be fined by the County up to
$100.00 for each affected Employee for each day paid at less than the Living Wage. Such
penalties will not be imposed on any Person except after a hearing (Cook County, Ill.,
Code, Ch. 2, Art. IX). Further, if an Employer is found to be in violation of this section,
the property tax incentive for this property is subject to revocation.

(6)

If an Employer is found to have retaliated against an affected Employee, the Employer's
property tax incentive may be terminated unless such Employer appropriately reinstates or
compensates such Employee.

(7)

For the purposes of this Section:
Property tax incentive means a reduction in the assessment level as set forth in Division 2
of this Article for Class 6b industrial property, Class 8 industrial property, or Class 9
multifamily residential property. "Property tax incentive" shall not include a Class 9
designation granted to supportive living facilities, which establish an alternative to nursing
home care for low income older persons and persons with disabilities under Medicaid and
which are certified by the State Department of Public Aid pursuant to Division 2 of this
Article; and
Sales tax means the Retailer's Occupation Tax, the Service Occupation Tax and/or the Use
Tax.

(8)

Living Wage Affidavit. Every municipality or the Cook County Board that provides a
Resolution or Ordinance or authorized officer letter, as the case may be, to an applicant for
a Class 6b industrial property or a Class 8 industrial property tax incentive shall maintain
in its files and records documentation that such municipality or the County Board received
and filed the Living Wage Affidavit submitted by the owner or lessee of such property
stating that such owner or lessee is paying a Living Wage to its Employees in compliance
with this Section. Further, an applicant or lessee of a Class 9 multifamily residential
property tax incentive shall provide the municipality or the Cook County Board, as the case
70

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

may be, a Living Wage Affidavit which shall be maintained by such municipality or the
Cook County Board in its files and records.
(b) Prevailing wage requirement.
(1)

Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 74-71(b) to the contrary, and for the
avoidance of doubt, any real estate granted any Property Tax Incentive under any
Assessment Class as set forth in Section 74-71(b)(4)(b) on or before July September 1,
2018 shall not be subject to the terms and conditions of Section 74-71(b). Real estate for
which an application for any classification is filed with the Assessor on or before July
September 1, 2018 and which thereafter is determined by the Assessor to be eligible for
the classification under the terms and conditions of this Division after July September 1,
2018, shall not be subject to the terms and conditions of Section 74-71(b).

(2)

Any owner of real estate that on or after July September 1, 2018 is an applicant for, or
recipient of, any Property Tax Incentive under any Assessment Class as set forth in
Division 2 of this Article for which a Resolution or Ordinance from the municipality or the
County Board is or was required, or where an authorized officer letter is or was obtained
in lieu of such Resolution or Ordinance, shall pay all laborers, workers and mechanics
engaged in Construction work within the subject property not less than the prevailing rate
of wages paid for work of a similar character on public works in Cook County. This
requirement extends to all contractors, subcontractors, and lessees who perform such
Construction work, whether or not at the direction of the owner.

(3)

The prevailing rate of wages shall be the same as the then-current rate for Cook County
determined pursuant to the Illinois Prevailing Wage Act (820 ILCS 130/0.01 et seq.).

(4)

(a)

Unless otherwise defined herein, the definition of any terms used in this Section
which are also used in the Illinois Prevailing Wage Act (820 ILCS 130/0.01 et
seq.) shall be the same as that set forth in the Illinois Prevailing Wage Act.

(b) For the purposes of Section 74-71(b):
Property Tax Incentive means a reduction in the assessment level as set forth in Division 2
of this Article for any property regardless of the Assessment Class for which a Resolution
or Ordinance from the municipality or the County Board is or was required, or where an
authorized officer letter is or was obtained in lieu of such Resolution or Ordinance.
Construction work means all work on any newly constructed building or any improvement
or renovation on any existing building or structure, on any real estate receiving a property
tax incentive involving laborers, workers or mechanics, regardless of the public or private
nature of the project. This includes any maintenance, repair, assembly, or disassembly
work performed on equipment whether owned, leased, or rented.
(5)

Any owner of real estate that on or after July September 1, 2018 is an applicant for, or
recipient of, any Property Tax Incentive under any Assessment Class as set forth in
Division 2 of this Article for which a Resolution or Ordinance from the municipality or the

only those calendar months during which such Construction work has occurred.
The certified payroll shall consist of a complete copy of the records identified in
this subsection (a) but may exclude the starting and ending times of work each day.
The certified payroll shall be accompanied by a statement signed by the owner or
an officer, authorized employee, or agent of the owner which avers that: (i) he or
she has examined the certified payroll records required to be submitted by this
Section and such records are true and accurate; and (ii) the hourly rate paid to each
worker is not less than the general prevailing rate of hourly wages required by this
Section. An owner is not prohibited from relying on the certification of a
contractor, subcontractor, or lessee provided the owner does not knowingly rely
upon a false certification. Each governmental body shall keep the records
submitted in accordance with this subsection (b) for a period of 5 years from the
date of the last payment for Construction work. The records submitted in
accordance with this subsection (b) shall be considered public records, except an
employee's address, telephone number, and social security number, and made
available in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act. The governmental
body shall accept any reasonable submissions that meet the requirements of this
Section.

The recipient must provide credible evidence that, at all times after it receives and
maintains any tax incentive classification under Division 2 of this Article, if any
Construction work, occurs at the subject property, then any contractors, subcontractors, or
lessees who perform such work must participate in an active apprenticeship and training
program approved and registered with the United States Department of Labor's Office of
Apprenticeship, if the contractor or subcontractor employs people in a covered occupation.

(c) Existing incentives classifications, pending applications and eligibility/renewal applications
submitted during the 2017 and 2018 assessment year shall not be suspended, revoked or terminated for
failure to comply with the affidavit requirements of Sections 74-71(b)(7)(2), 74-71(c)(2), 74-72 and 7474(b) and (d), and all affidavits submitted pursuant to such Sections shall be considered void for any

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
DECLARING A VOTE OF NO CONFIDENCE IN THE COOK COUNTY ASSESSOR AND

SYSTEM
WHEREAS, Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle and Assessor Joe Berrios both were sworn
in to their respective offices in 2010, and
WHEREAS, in the summer of 2017, the Chicago Tribune published a series outlining decades of
regressively in residential property assessments in Cook County, and
WHEREAS, in response to that article and a hearing of the County Board, the Assessor’s Office and
President’s Office announced a study of the assessment system to be conducted by the Civic Consulting
Alliance, and
WHEREAS, that study confirmed the Tribune’s findings of a failure to accurately assess residential
properties in Cook County, and
WHEREAS, the study further confirmed that Cook County’s property tax assessment system is causing a
wealth transfer from owners of lower-value homes to those of higher-value homes, and
WHEREAS, both President Preckwinkle and Assessor Berrios have indicated that the issues with the
residential assessment system have existed for 40 years, yet those issues have persisted since they each took
office, and
WHEREAS, the study by the Civic Consulting Alliance is simply the latest in a series of studies outlining
issues in the assessment system, and
WHEREAS, the Assessor’s Office has said repeatedly that homeowners can simply appeal their property
taxes if they feel there’s an issue, but the study found that the regressivity is even worse at the appellate
level, and

WHEREAS, According to statistics from USA Today, between 2006 and 2017 there were mass shootings
approximately every 16 days in the United States, with the most recent incident in Parkland Florida sparking
a renewed and broad sweeping national conversation on the need for common-sense gun solutions to keep
our citizens safe while protecting the 2nd Amendment, and
WHEREAS, In Chicago and Cook County, particularly minority communities that often have the greatest
economic needs, gun violence is a traumatic and daily occurrence that has reached a crisis point, prevents
economic growth and leads to increased incarceration and the perpetuation of the cycle of violence, and
WHEREAS, According to statistics in 2017, there were 743 homicides as a result of gun violence in
Chicago and Cook County, and,
WHEREAS, Gun violence has taken a massive toll on Cook County, taking the lives of countless men and
women, many young, leaving physical, psychology, emotional scars for the victims and their families that
survive, and producing untreated and pervasive trauma in communities, individuals and children, and
WHEREAS, The effects and costs of gun violence can be seen throughout the county in our criminal justice
system, included but not limited to the offices of the Sheriff, State’s Attorney, and Public Defenders, the
hospital system, and Medical Examiner’s Office.
WHEREAS, The time is now for comprehensive gun control laws. It is time for our federal and state
representatives to take a stand on this crisis, and
WHEREAS, Cook County echoes President Donald Trump’s call for strengthened background checks, the
ban of bump stocks and raising the age from 18 to 21 for the purchase of assault-style weapons, and
WHEREAS, Cook County calls upon its residents to reach out to their elected officials to urge the passage
of a variety of common-sense gun control policies in Springfield, including but not limited to requiring gun
dealers to be licensed, strengthened background checks, and banning the use of military-style weapons,
high capacity magazines and the civilian sale of body armor, and
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, A step toward more comprehensive gun safety laws is a step in the
right direction because every gun death, is one too many.
THEREFORE, BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, The Cook County President and the Cook County
Board Commissioners call upon Washington D.C. and the State of Illinois to pass comprehensive gun
control laws immediately to protect all residents of our country.

Existing rule:
Section 420.135Maintenance of Records by Respondent
Once a Complaint has been served on a Respondent, the Respondent shall preserve all records and other
material which may be relevant to the Complaint until the matter has been closed.
Revised rule:
Section 420.135Maintenance of Records by Respondent Parties
Once a Complaint has been served on a Respondent, the Complainant(s) and Respondent(s) shall
preserve all records and other material which may be relevant to the Complaint or any defenses until the
matter has been closed by the Commission. Provided that a party has not previously incurred a duty to
