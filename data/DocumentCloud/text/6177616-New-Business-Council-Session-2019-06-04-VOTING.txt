St. Patrick Senior Center has always had an Emergency Action Plan in place which will

loss, or loss of life, in the event of an actual or potential major disaster. A major disaster
may include, but is not limited to any of the following: fire, tornado, earthquake, bomb

Action Plan describes the initial responsibilities and actions to be taken to protect all
until the appropriate responders take over.

For the protection of employees, an Emergency Action Plan is a requirement of OSHA
1910.38. It is also necessary and prudent for the protection of our employees, clients,
and visitors. The employer will review with each employee those parts of the plan that
the employee must know to protect themselves and others in the event of an
emergency. In addition, the written plan shall be made available for employees to
review and plan for their evacuation.

GENERAL PROCEDURES

it is impossible to provide specific information for all situations. There is no guarantee
implied by this Plan that a perfect response to disaster emergency incidents will be
practical or possible. Therefore, this plan is a guide for employees to familiarize
themselves with basic emergency planning, response and evaluation.

aid. Until rescue personnel arrive, administer first aid in the building or, in the event of a

2. Clear the air passages using the Heimlich Maneuver (abdominal thrusts
