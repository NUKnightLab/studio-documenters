 Independent Auditor's Report
To the Board of Directors
Chicago Infrastructure Trust
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the Chicago Infrastructure Trust,
which comprise the statement of financial position as of December 31, 2013, and the related
statements of activities and cash flows for the period from April 24, 2012 (commencement of
operations) through December 31, 2013, and the related notes to the financial statements.
Management's Responsibility for the Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial
statements in accordance with accounting principles general accepted in the United States of
America; this includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant
to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditor's Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the
United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's
judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial
statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor
considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation and fair presentation of the
financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
entity's internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes
evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of
significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
presentation of the financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
basis for our audit opinion.

 Opinion

the financial position of the Chicago Infrastructure Trust as of December 31, 2013 and the
changes in its net assets and cash flows from April 24, 2012 (commencement of operations)
through December 31, 2013, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America.

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust
Notes to Financial Statements
December 31, 2013

Note 1 - Organization
The Chicago Infrastructure Trust (the "Trust") was incorporated as a non-profit organization
on April 24, 2012 under executive order of the Mayor and City Council resolution. The Trust
operates exclusively for civic and charitable purposes in the Chicago Metropolitan area and
is a tax exempt entity pursuant to Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.
The Trust assists the people of the City of Chicago, the City government and its sister
agencies in providing alternative financing and project delivery options for transformative
infrastructure projects. To accomplish this, the Trust hopes to structure innovative financing
strategies and attract capital from diverse groups of investors. The Trust also hopes to
achieve and demonstrate real risk transfer to third-party investors, and to stimulate crossagency financing while creating efficient capital structures.
The sole source of revenue is from the City of Chicago's grant program further discussed in
Note 2.
Note 2 - Summary of significant accounting policies
Basis of presentation
The Trust presents its financial statements in accordance with the accounting guidance for
nonprofit entities. Under this guidance, the Trust is required to report information regarding
its financial position and activities according to three classes of net assets: unrestricted net
assets, temporarily restricted net assets and permanently restricted net assets.
Furthermore, information is required to segregate program service expenses from support
expenses. Support expenses include accounting fees, committee expenses, computer and
software, insurance, IT support, office supplies and expenses, professional and consulting
fees, salaries and wages, employee taxes and benefits, telephone and internet, travel and
meals, website design and other general and administrative expenses.
Revenue recognition
Grants received are recorded as unrestricted, temporarily restricted or permanently
restricted support, depending on the existence and/or nature of any donor restrictions.
Conditional promises to give are not recognized until they become unconditional: that is,
when the conditions on which they depend are substantially met.
For the period from April 24, 2012 (commencement of operations) through December 31,
2013, the Trust was awarded two cost reimbursement grants from the City of Chicago
totaling $653,350. As of December 31, 2013, grant funds of $450,000 were received,
$77,806 remains receivable, of which $63,729 was approved by the City of Chicago, and
an additional $14,077 has been incurred and is pending approval although conditions have
been met. The remaining balance of the awarded 2013 grants totaling $125,544 will be
carried over into the subsequent year.

Prepaid expenses
Advance payments for expenses related to subscriptions and insurance policies are
classified as prepaid expenses.
Use of estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.
Net assets
The Trust classifies net assets as unrestricted, temporarily restricted or permanently
restricted.
Unrestricted net assets are neither permanently restricted nor temporarily restricted by
donor-imposed stipulations.
Temporarily restricted net assets of the Trust result (a) from contributions and other inflows
of assets whose use by the Trust is limited by donor-imposed stipulations that either expire
by passage of time or can be fulfilled and removed by actions of the Trust pursuant to those
stipulations, (b) from other asset enhancements and diminishments subject to the same
kinds of stipulations and (c) from reclassifications to (or from) other classes of net assets as
a consequence of donor-imposed stipulations, their expiration by passage of time, or their
fulfillment and removal by actions of the Trust pursuant to those stipulations.
Income taxes
The Trust has applied for and received a determination letter from the Internal Revenue
Service ("IRS") to be treated as a tax exempt entity pursuant to Section 501(c)(3) of the
Internal Revenue Code and did not have any unrelated business income for the period from
April 24, 2012 (commencement of operations) through December 31, 2013. Due to its tax
exempt status, the Trust is not subject to income taxes, but is required to file and does file
tax returns with the IRS and other taxing authorities. Accordingly, these financial
statements do not reflect a provision for income taxes and the Trust has no other tax
positions which must be considered for disclosure. Income tax returns filed by the company
are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service for a period of three years.
While no income tax returns are currently being examined by the Internal Revenue Service,
tax years since inception remain open.
Advertising
Advertising costs are charged to operations when incurred.

Note 3 - Concentration of revenue / related party
A substantial portion of the Trust's revenue was received from the City of Chicago.
Substantial revenue is defined as revenue earned from any source that is in excess of 10%
of the total revenue of the company. From the period April 24, 2012 (commencement of
operations) through December 31, 2013, revenue from the City of Chicago was $522,751,
or 100% of total revenue.
Note 4 - Temporarily restricted net assets

restrictions:

operations) through December 31, 2013, consist of the following:

Note 5 - Evaluation of subsequent events
Events that occur after the statement of financial position date, but before the financial
statements were available to be issued, must be evaluated for recognition or disclosure.
The effects of subsequent events that provide evidence about conditions that existed at the
statement of financial position date are recognized in the accompanying financial
statements. Subsequent events which provide evidence about conditions that existed after
the statement of financial position date require disclosure in the accompanying notes.
Management evaluated the activity of Chicago Infrastructure Trust through July 17, 2014
(the date the financial statements were available to be issued) and concluded that no
subsequent events have occurred that would require recognition in the financial statements
or disclosure in the notes to financial statements.
