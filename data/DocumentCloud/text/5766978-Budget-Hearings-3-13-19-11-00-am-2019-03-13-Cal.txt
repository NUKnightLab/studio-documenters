UNFINISHED BUSINESS
1.
Status of Legislative Policy Division Earning Income in the City. (President Pro Tem
Sheffield directed the Legislative Policy Division (LPD) to consult with the Office of
the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO) and draft an ordinance that mandates periodic
reporting to the City by employers of non-Detroit residents who earn income in the
City, which is therefore taxable by the City at the rate of 1.2%. Due to the City’s welldocumented fiscal challenges, the importance of collecting every single potential
revenue dollar cannot be overstated. And because state laws limited mandatory
withholding and other factors, it has been widely alleged that many nonresident
workers who actually earn income by work performed in the City may nevertheless
not be paying local income tax on those earnings. Therefore this is a problem that
cries out for solutions to benefit the City and our residents.) (BROUGHT BACK AS
