 EXPLANATION
On May 18, 2004, the Board authorized the CHA to negotiate and enter into a contract with
Stateway Associates, LLC (“Stateway Associates”), the master developer for Stateway Gardens
to provide community and supportive services (“CSS”) to CHA residents relocating to the
Stateway Gardens revitalized mixed-income community (i.e. The Pershing, Park Boulevard).
The Contract became effective January 13, 2005 for a period of 12 months with a one (1) year
option. In January 2006, the Board authorized the CHA to exercise the one-year option for the
term of January 13, 2006 through January 12, 2007. The Board authorized CHA to extend the
Contract for an additional year in 2007, and again for the second and third year extensions in
2008 and 2009. This current request for funding is to continue the provision of CSS for the
period May 1, 2010 through April 30, 2011.
The Contract’s primary focus has been to assist CHA families that choose to return to the
revitalized Stateway Gardens mixed-income community and assist families in maintaining lease
compliance post-occupancy. The provision of services at Park Boulevard, contemplated as part
of the competitive procurement of the Developer, is required by the Master Development
Agreement governing this development. Under this agreement, the parties envisioned that
Stateway Associates would provide social services (through a subcontractor) and would receive
financial assistance from the CHA pending funding availability and contract performance.
CHA desires to extend the Contract for the period of May 1, 2010 to April 30, 2011. This will
allow Stateway Associates to continue providing post-occupancy services to the 54 families who
have relocated to Park Boulevard and the 27 families who have relocated to the Pershing.
Based upon the foregoing, it is in the best interest of the CHA to extend the Contract with
Stateway Associates, LLC for the period of May 1, 2010 through April 30, 2011 and increase the
Contract’s funding by an amount not-to-exceed $360,000 adding it to the carryover balance
available at the end of the current contract term to provide CSS to CHA residents relocating to
the revitalized Stateway Gardens community. The Contract’s new aggregate not-to-exceed
compensation amount will be $3,150,200.
