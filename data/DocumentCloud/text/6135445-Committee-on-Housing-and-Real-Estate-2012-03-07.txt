2011 Fourth Quarter Progress Report
October-December

 Letter From The Commissioner
We are pleased to submit the 2011 Fourth Quarter Progress Report, which presents the Department of
Housing and Economic Development’s progress on the goals set forth in the City’s fourth Affordable
Housing Plan for the years 2009-2013.
In 2011 the Department committed over $315 million to support more than 7,800 units of affordable housing. This represents approximately 72% of our annual resource allocation goal and 97% of
our units assisted goal.
During the fourth quarter, the Department approved financing for four multifamily developments
and sponsored a Rents Right Housing Expo to assist tenants and landlords in finding answers to their
housing questions.
Despite ongoing challenges in the housing and lending markets during 2011, the Department continued to work effectively toward achieving the five-year goals under our three main program priorities:
Create and Preserve Affordable Rental, Promote and Support Homeownership, and Improve and
Preserve Homes. Through the first three years of the current five-year plan, the City has committed
more than $930 million on behalf of over 25,000 units. This represents 47% of our five-year resource
allocation goal and 51% of our units assisted goal.
As always, we would like to thank all of our partners for their continued support and cooperation.
Working with them, we will continue to progress in our goals to create and preserve affordable housing for the people of Chicago.

       
Andrew J. Mooney     
Commissioner

 Introduction

T

his document is the 2011 Fourth Quarter Progress
Report on the Chicago Department of Housing and

Economic Development’s Affordable Housing Plan, 2009-2013.

For 2011, HED projected commitments of over $437 million
to support 8,051 units of housing.

Over the full year, the Department committed over $315
million to support more than 7,800 units, representing 72.4%
of the 2011 resource allocation goal and 97.3% of the unit
goal. This demonstrates significant progress toward achieving
the five-year goals of the 2009-2013 plan. Through the end of
2011, the third year of the plan, the City has reached 47.1%
of its five-year resource allocation goal and 51.4% of its unit
goal.

 CREATION AND PRESERVATION
OF AFFORDABLE RENTAL UNITS
Multifamily Rehab and New Construction
Borinquen Bella Apartments
On November 2, 2011, the City Council approved a
$3.9 million loan and fee waivers for a major renovation
of 47 rental units in four buildings in the West Town
community. The properties, which include one 4-story
and three 3-story buildings, are located at 1414 and
1451 N. Washtenaw and 1318 and 1456 N. Rockwell
in the 26th Ward.
The developer is Borinquen Bella LP, a subsidiary
of Latin United Community Housing Association
(LUCHA).   The $11.8 million project will include
kitchen and bathroom upgrades for each unit, along
with new roofs, windows, doors, and flooring. The
renovated units will feature high-efficiency heaters as well as low-water usage toilets, showers
and faucets. In addition, all refrigerators, ranges, and window air conditioning units will be
Energy Star-rated, and hallway lighting will be high-efficiency.
The upgraded apartments, which will include one-, two- and three-bedroom units, will be
available to households at or below 60% of area median income.

North and Talman Phase III
Also on November 2, the City Council approved the development of 33 affordable units
on another West Town site through the conversion of a vacant 4-story warehouse and the
construction of three new 2-flats.  Phase III of the North and Talman project will complete
a block-long, 110-unit redevelopment on the north side of W. North Avenue
between Talman and Washtenaw Avenues.
The developer, Hispanic Housing Development Corporation, will acquire a City-owned
structure at 2656 W. North Avenue for $1 and convert it into 27 affordable rental units on
five floors. The two-flats will be constructed at 1615-17 N. Washtenaw and 1618-20 N.
Talman.

Quarter ending December 2011

 Along with the vacated building, the City is providing more than $2.3 million in Tax
Increment Financing (TIF) assistance to facilitate the $14.7 million project.   Additional
financing includes Illinois Housing Development Authority incentives and private loans.
Earlier phases of the North and Talman development have already created a new 53-unit
rental building for seniors and 24 affordable lease-to-own units for families.

Renaissance Apartments
On October 5, the City Council authorized the acquisition and rehab of a 117-unit rental property
located on six scattered sites in the Woodlawn community.  The project was originally developed
as Central Woodlawn I Apartments in 1994 by Rescorp and its non-profit partner, Woodlawn
Preservation Investment Corporation, and later acquired by AIMCO. The property’s financing included a tax credit investment by the Chicago Equity Fund. The 15-year tax credit period
has now expired, and AIMCO has sold the partnership to the current developer, Preservation of
Affordable Housing (POAH), for $9.5 million.
The 117 units include a mix of 1- to 4-bedroom apartments in six 3-story walk-up buildings. The
property is currently required to restrict incomes for 20 units to occupants at or below 30% of
AMI (under the ARC program), 40 units to 50% AMI and 57 units to 60% AMI. The upgraded
apartments will feature new kitchen cabinets and bathrooms.
Under the terms of the Redevelopment Agreement, POAH has assumed the existing HED loan of
$5.5 million, subordinated to a new first mortgage for $4.7 million. A $1.1 million ARC loan from
the Chicago Low Income Housing Trust Fund will be forgiven. Construction is scheduled to be
completed by September 2012.

 This courtyard building at
6105-15 S. Ellis is one of
six Woodlawn properties being
rehabbed through the Renaissance
Apartments redevelopment.

Resurrection Homes Rental Project
On December 14, the City Council approved up to $800,000 in loans and fee waivers for conversion of seven unsold New Homes for Chicago (NHFC) units to affordable rental housing. The
units, which include five 2-bedroom and two 3-bedroom apartments, are located in two 2-flats and
a condo building in the Pilsen, Little Village and North Lawndale community areas on the west side.
The converted apartments will be offered to families at or below 60% of area median income.
The developer, The Resurrection Project, originally constructed the buildings under a 2006
Redevelopment Agreement for development of approximately 130 units to be sold to qualifying
homebuyers under NHFC. However, due
to the failure of the housing market, sales
of these seven units did not materialize.
Consequently, the units will be removed
from the NHFC Redevelopment Agreement
(which runs through August 14, 2012) in
order to convert them to affordable rental
apartments. The corporate and HOME subsidies originally allocated under NHFC will
be recaptured. No further construction starts
of for-sale units are planned.

 IMPROVEMENT AND PRESERVATION
OF HOMES
Historic Chicago Bungalow Initiative
In December 2011, the Historic Chicago Bungalow Association (HCBA) presented six Chicago
homeowners with Richard H. Driehaus Foundation Bungalow Awards for excellence in bungalow
landscaping, rehab or restoration projects.  The winners each received a cash award of $1,000 along
with a handcrafted bronze plaque.  Nominees were judged based on overall visual impression, creativity and how well the projects maintained the integrity of the historic Chicago bungalow.
The Historic Chicago Bungalow Initiative was established by the City in 2000 to foster an appreciation of the Chicago bungalow as a distinctive housing type, encourage sympathetic rehabilitation
of Chicago bungalows and assist bungalow owners in adapting their homes to current needs. The
City administers the program through HCBA, which has provided a variety of grants and technical
assistance to bungalow owners. Currently, HCBA offers the following services:
 
 
 
 
 
 

•  Free design guidelines to aid owners in preserving the architectural
character of their bungalows
• Pattern drawings to assist owners, architects and contractors with typical projects
• Regular “how-to” seminars on topics related to bungalow rehab and restoration
•  Bungalow Partners Resource Guide listing crafts people, vendors and
specialists in bungalow restoration
•  Free permit assistance and expedited permitting for owners engaged in restoration
or rehabilitation
• HCBA certificate and plaque plus free subscription to “Inside the Belt” newsletter

Chicago’s 80,000 bungalows comprise nearly one-third of the city’s single-family housing stock.
Since 2000, the Historic Bungalow Initiative has provided financial assistance to nearly 6,300 households in buying, repairing or rehabbing their homes.

This basement rehab was one of six
winners of Richard H. Driehaus
Foundation Bungalow Awards in
2011.

 POLICY, LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS
AND OTHER ISSUES
Density Bonus Update
On December 16, 2011, HED accepted a density bonus payment of $2,920,844 to the
Affordable Housing Opportunity Fund. That sum represents the City’s largest density bonus
payment received to date, and brings the total amount collected for affordable housing since
the program’s inception in 2004 to $25.3 million. This payment, in addition to generating a
significant donation for affordable housing, will also enable the developers of a new hotel at
Clark Street and Grand Avenue to construct a project that is roughly 85,000 square feet larger
than would have been allowed without the bonus.
Under City law, developers of projects in certain downtown zoning districts have the option
to claim an Affordable Housing Zoning Bonus–commonly referred to as the density bonus–
in return for making a payment to the Affordable Housing Opportunity Fund or providing
affordable units. Payments to the Fund are then distributed as follows: 40% to the Chicago
Low Income Housing Trust Fund for rental assistance to very low-income households and
60% to HED for the construction and rehabilitation of affordable housing.

Eighth Annual Rents Right Housing Expo
On October 22, 2011, the Arturo Velazquez West Side Technical Institute hosted the city’s
eighth annual Rents Right Expo to assist tenants and landlords with questions about their
rights and responsibilities. Featuring approximately forty housing agencies and service
providers, the Expo was co-sponsored by HED and the Rents Right Committee, which
provides problem-solving resources to tenants and landlords.
“A good rental relationship starts on move-in day, and both tenants and landlords should
know their rights and responsibilities under the law,” said HED Commissioner Andrew
Mooney. “The Rents Right Expo is a great place to get details about specific issues and how
to resolve them.”
At the event, a wide range of government and community agencies answered questions from
140 attendees about conflict resolution, building code violations, housing discrimination, pest
control and other housing issues. Visitors could also attend three bilingual workshops focused
on specific rental topics.
Participating agencies and service providers included the Metropolitan Tenants Organization,
Community Investment Corporation, the Spanish Coalition for Housing, Access Living, the
Lawyer’s Committee for Better Housing, Latino Policy Forum and the Safer Pest Control
Project.

CITY OF CHICAGO
MAXIMUM AFFORDABLE MONTHLY RENTS 2011

NOTE: Gross rent limits for 50% and 65% AMI and the Fair Market Rent are published by HUD. All other rent limits are calculated assuming 1.5 occupants per bedroom and 1 occupant for an apartment with no bedrooms.
* For HOME-funded developments, rents are the "lesser of" the FMR for the unit size or 30% of the adjusted income of a family whos income equals 65% of the area median. This is known as the "High HOME Rent." In HOMEfunded developments with 5 or more units, 20% of the HOME-assisted units must be occupied by very-low income families whose rents do not exceed 30% of the annual income of a family whose income equals 50% of the area
median. This is known as the "Low HOME Rent."
