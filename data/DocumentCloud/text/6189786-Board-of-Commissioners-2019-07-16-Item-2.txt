Background
As a result of Gautreaux et al. v Chicago Housing Authority in 1966, CHA became the first public
housing authority to offer a mobility program, known as the Gautreaux Assisted Housing
Program. Although the court ordered Gautreaux program ended in 1998, CHA has continued to
provide mobility services and currently offers the largest non-court ordered mobility program in
the United States. The Mobility Counseling program, implemented through CHA’s Resident
Services Division since 2012, seeks to increase the number of Housing Choice Voucher (“HCV”)
participants who live in higher opportunity neighborhoods throughout Chicago. A Mobility Area
is a Chicago community area with poverty levels below 20% and low violent crime rates. These

 areas have been identified as offering quality housing, diverse neighborhoods, access to better
educational and employment opportunities that can assist families towards self-sufficiency.
CHA’s Mobility Counseling program is a voluntary program available to participants of the HCV
program. Mobility counseling, a key component of the program, is the process of educating and
empowering HCV participants to make informed housing decisions based on the benefits of
accessing well-performing schools, safe, healthy neighborhoods, and the opportunity to work
towards breaking the cycle of poverty over time.
HCV participants that choose to participate in CHA’s Mobility Counseling program can utilize their
housing subsidy to move to better neighborhoods within the city of Chicago. Through the
Mobility Counseling program, participants receive additional education, support, and assistance
to move into CHA-designated Mobility Areas. As of 2018, twenty-one percent of HCV households
live in a Mobility Area. Eighty-nine percent of households moving to Mobility Areas have
remained in a Mobility Area. During the next contract term, HCP of Illinois, Inc. will support
approximately 400 families move to Mobility Areas annually.
Procurement Process
• CHA issued RFP Event No. 2660 on February 28, 2019 requesting qualified firms to provide
Mobility Counseling Services for CHA residents; the deadline for proposal submission was
March 28, 2019.
• Two (2) proposals were submitted and scored by the evaluation committee.

Vendor Information

and economic diversity in housing. HCP’s mission is to expand housing choice for very low-income
