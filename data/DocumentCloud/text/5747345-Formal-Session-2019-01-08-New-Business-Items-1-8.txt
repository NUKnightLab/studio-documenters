RESOLUTION CONTINUING THE DETROIT CITY COUNCIL
TASK FORCE ON MENTAL HEALTH

 

By Council Member Roy McCalister,

l.

Mental Health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through
adulthood. It includes our emotional, and social well being. The problems of
mental health range from depression and anxiety, to more infrequent in?ictions such as
schizophrenia and bipolar disorder; it affects how we think, feel, and act. It also determines how
we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices, and

Michigan?s Mental Health problems began when Congress passed the Community Mental
Health Act of 1963. It provided an incentive for the closing of state-funded mental hospitals
while promising to fund community?based mental health centers and programs to provide
outpatient treatment. Former Governor of Michigan, John Engler, closed a number of state
facilities soon after he became governor in 1991. The funds for the mental health
centers never materialized, leaving us with our current challenges, and

There is a de?ciency of resources and lack of coordination available for persons af?icted with
mental health problems as demonstrated by the crime, homelessness, and poverty statistically
linked to mental health challenges within the city of Detroit; and

The Detroit City Charter was established to ?[address] the needs of all citizens?, and to
?[institute] programs, services and activities addressing the needs of our community?; within its
Declaration of Rights explicitly states that ?The city shall provide for the public peace, health
and safety of persons and property within its jurisdictional limits?; and

The public peace, health, and safety in the City of Detroit could be greatly improved by a
concentrated collaborative effort between the City Council and those organizations which
advocate for, and provide mental health services; and

The Detroit Wayne County Mental Health Authority, a safety net organization that provides
access to a ?ill array of services and supports to empower persons within the Detroit Wayne
County behavioral health system. The Detroit Wayne County Mental Health Authority served
just over 77,000 clients in 2017 within Wayne County and 53% (40,992) of these persons are in
the City of Detroit. Of this group of individuals, the majority is between the ages of 22 and 50

years old.

The establishment of a Mental Health Task Force is intended to facilitate equitable access to
resources, contribute to the provision of a substantial quality of life for all residents of the city of
Detroit, and to reduce the frequency of instances of criminal activity related to mental illness;

and

It is ineffective and detrimental to the human capital of the City of Detroit to process those
persons living with mental illness through the criminal justice system as a result of their illness;
and



t: :1 1. i 

WHEREAS The goal and overall purpose of the Mental Health Task Force can have a signi?cant impact in
the City of Detroit and its residents through heightening awareness, promoting education,
improving coordination of services, prevention and, strengthening the capacity of the city to
serve those residents need with access to mental health resources and services; and NOW
THEREFORE BE IT

RESOLVED That the Detroit City Council hereby continues the Mental Health Task Force,
chaired by Council Member Roy McCalister, Jr., effective immediately and
continuing through December 31, 2018.

A RESOLUTION AUTHORIZING THE CITY TASK FORCE ON
HOMELESSNESS

BY: Council Member Mary Shef?eld

WHEREAS, The Detroit Metro area (Wayne, Oakland, Macomb and Monroe counties)
has the highest homeless population in the state of Michigan with approximately 34,000
homeless individuals, including 5,536 children in families and 192 unaccompanied
minors. Approximately 69% of homeless Michigan families are headed by single
mothers. The homeless population in the City of Detroit stands around 16,200 and
represents almost half of the overall number in the Detroit Metro area. The last task force
on homelessness was initiated by the Mayor?s of?ce in 1994, and there is a dire need for
a renewed focus and greater assistance; and

WHEREAS, This taskforce will be a collaborative effort among several stakeholders that
will seek to coordinate existing agencies and departments to create an overall strategy for
the homeless population in the City of Detroit. The taskforce will seek to facilitate efforts
on homelessness from agencies and departments such as: the Department of Housing and
Revitalization, Homeless Action Network of Detroit, Neighborhood Services
Organization, Detroit Rescue Mission Ministries, Cass Community Social Services and
any other entity whose mission is to address homelessness in the City of Detroit; and

WHEREAS, In an effort to address the needs of vulnerable populations, the taskforce
will evaluate and strategize with local partners to explore current uses of Community
Development Block Grants, Emergency Solutions Grants, and other funding sources
made available to the city. Improvements and recommendations will be made on the
allocation of these funds to ensure that the homeless population of Detroit is being
adequately and humanely served. The taskforce will also begin to formulate new and
creative ways to leverage federal and private funding to address the needs that are
speci?c to Detroit?s homeless population; and

WHEREAS, The City of Detroit currently subscribes to "Moving Forward Together: A
Ten-Year Plan to End Homelessness in Detroit, Hamtramck, and Highland Park,
Michigan." The taskforce will use this existing strategy as a ?amework and identify ways
to improve implementation. Following the City of Detroit?s current plan, the task force
will focus and be centered on six core areas for action: housing, prevention, support
services, employment and job training, community engagement, and collaboration; and

WHEREAS, Detroit?s current housing stock, as it relates to blighted and abandoned
buildings creates a unique opportunity to explore creative ways to address homelessness.
The task force will aggressively create opportunities to use Detroit?s existing housing
stock to implement the ?Housing First Strategy? a proven method of helping move
people with substance abuse and/or mental health issues off the streets and into
permanent housing; and

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, That the Detroit City Council authorizes
the creation of a City of Detroit Homelessness Task Force, to be chaired by Council
Member Shef?eld; and

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That the Task Force on Homelessness will continue
through December 31, 2019. All meetings will be open to the public with future dates,
times, and locations to be noticed by the of?ce of the City Clerk
