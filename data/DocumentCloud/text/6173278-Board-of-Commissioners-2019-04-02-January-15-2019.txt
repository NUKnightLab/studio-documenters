(Item 1)
CHA issued an RFP in September 2018 requesting qualified firms to provide Employment Preparation
and Placement Services for CHA residents. Nine proposals were received and scored by the evaluation
1

 committee and five were determined to be in the competitive range. After further review of the vendors
in the competitive range, the evaluation committee recommended award of contract to Employment &
Employer Services, Centers for New Horizons and Phalanx Family Services. Accordingly, the
resolution for Item No. 1 approves execution of a contract with Employment & Employer Services,
Centers for New Horizons and Phalanx Family Services in an aggregate amount of $8,349,243 for a
two-year base term and three (3) one-year option terms to provide employment placement services.
CHA’s employment preparation and placement program will prioritize service delivery for CHA public
housing residents and Housing Choice Voucher participants, 18 years of age or older and 17 years of
age, not attending school full time with priority given to those who must meet CHA’s work requirement.
The service delivery framework will consist of a comprehensive approach that focuses on services that
provide the education, skills, work experience, and support needed to successfully transition to a career
and accomplish self-sufficiency and/or enhanced earning power. During 2019, employment placement
services were removed from the FamilyWorks program, and will be shifted to the recommended
awardees. The recommended awardees will leverage CHA’s additional employment and education
resources, such as FamilyWorks, Transitional Jobs, Chicago Cook Workforce Partnership, City Colleges
of Chicago, CHA’s scholarship program, etc. to assist with service delivery.
The Board further
authorizes re-allocation of contract values as deemed appropriate, provided the Board approved
aggregate amount is not exceeded.

RESOLUTION NO. 2019-CHA-5

Board Letter dated January 15, 2019 entitled "AUTHORIZATION TO ENTER INTO
AN INTERGOVERNMENTAL AGREEMENT WITH THE CITY OF CHICAGO
POLICE DEPARTMENT FOR SUPPLEMENTAL POLICE SERVICES FOR 2019 AND
2020".
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF THE
CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY:
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his designee
to
enter into an Intergovernmental Agreement with the Chicago Police Department for a
two-year period from January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2020 to provide

(Item 5)
The non-dwelling facility located at 1000 N. Sedgwick is a CHA-owned, two-story located within the
Cabrini-Green Development. This property is comprised of a gymnasium, weight room, warming
kitchen, assembly room, administrative offices, outdoor playground and nine classrooms. The CHA
awarded a contract to CCC Holdings, Inc. dba Chicago Commercial Construction at the May 2017
Board meeting for the renovation of the building located at 1000 N. Sedgwick Street to upgrade,
modernize and bring the property in line with overall CHA building standards, accessibility
requirements and current building codes. The contract award inclusive of the approved contingency was
a total not-to-exceed amount of $4,500,868.12. Since the May 2017 Board meeting, the project
experienced several delays associated with existing poor soil conditions and structural issues that
prevented the timely completion of base scope work. The poor condition of the existing soils under the
building to support the planned new elevator and other existing adverse structural conditions could not
4

 have been discovered except during the extensive demolition phase of the construction. The scope of
demolition necessarily became more extensive as the extent of the adverse discovered conditions
became better known and efforts were made to determine the full scope of such conditions.
Accordingly, the resolution for Item No. 5 approves a contract modification with CCC Holdings, Inc.
dba Chicago Commercial Construction totaling $579,613.45.
