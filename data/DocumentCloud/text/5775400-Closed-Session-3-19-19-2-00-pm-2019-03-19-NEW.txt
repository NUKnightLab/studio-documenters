BY COUNCIL MEMBER 

RESOLUTION OPPOSING HOUSE BILLS 4083 AND 4090, THE LOCAL
CT and THE COUNTY
SANCTUARY POLICY PROHIBITION A CT

WHEREAS, On January 24, 2019, House Bills 4083 and 4090, entitled The Local
Government Sanctuary Policy Prohibition Act and The County Sanctuary
Policy Prohibition Act, respectively, were introduced in the Michigan
Legislature with the stated purpose: ?to prohibit local units of government
?'om enacting or enforcing any law, ordinance, policy, or rule that limits
local of?cials, of?cers, or employees from communicating or cooperating
with appropriate federal of?cials concerning the immigration status of
individuals; to prescribe the powers and duties of certain state and local
of?cers, of?cials, and employees; and to prescribe penalties and
remedies.? And

WHEREAS, The bills could negatively impact ?welcoming communities?, including
Detroit, across the state of Michigan. As stated in the Detroit City
Council?s resolution af?rming our Welcoming City status, ?the City of
Detroit believes in the innate dignity of all its residents and recognizes the
importance of their valuable contributions to the social, religious, cultural,
and economic life within the city. The City of Detroit acknowledges,
honors, and values our immigrant and migrant roots, and embraces the
values of family, faith, and hard work?; and

WHEREAS, If enacted, HB 4083 will likely undercut the policy and function of the
City?s human rights ordinance, which was intended to reduce racial and
ethnic pro?ling and to provide assurance to Detroit?s immigrant
community that it is safe to seek City services and, particularly police
assistance, without fear of needless exposure to Federal immigration
authorities by the Detroit Police Department or other City of Detroit
service providers. In contrast, the bill?s prohibition on any local law or
policy limiting police communication with federal immigration
authorities, such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), about a
person?s immigration status could have the unwelcomed effect of
encouraging inquiries about status and therefore, incentivizing racial
pro?ling; and

WHEREAS, The City?s commitment to providing our immigrant communities and all
Detroiters with the opportunity to grow and thrive in an atmosphere of
safety and security is evident in the City?s human rights ordinance, which
was enacted to assure all members of the community that they can seek
City services without fear, and that victims of crime can both seek police
assistance as well as assist the police as witnesses when necessary. In

March 2019

WHEREAS,

WHEREAS,

WHEREAS,

RESOLVED,

RESOLVED,

March 2019

many instances, due to proximity to the issues, local government is more
knowledgeable and better able to assess speci?c needs and prescribe such
standards and regulations for their own local community than the State
government; the community?s sense of comfort when interacting with the
police is perhaps the most sensitive of these situations; and

The bills also place an undue burden on local governments, particularly
local law enforcement, for training staff and of?cers on the evolving
nuances and correct interpretation of immigration law; and

The timing for enactment of this proposed legislation would intensify a
climate of fear and intimidation among the immigrant population, which
would make a population that has proven in the past to be very dif?cult to
count during the decennial census, even more so. The under count of this
critical population would translate to the potential loss of millions of
federal tax dollars that are desperately needed to provide for the
population; and

Finally, while Detroit?s human rights ordinance does not prohibit police
communication with federal authorities regarding an individual?s
immigration status, it discourages the initial inquiry and might be
misinterpreted as inconsistent with HB 4083; therefore, the bill?s
inappropriate creation of a personal cause of action for individual residents
seeking to enforce the bill?s prohibitions could result in misguided
enforcement litigation against the City. NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT

That the Detroit City Council strongly opposes House Bill 4083,
applicable to local units of government, the ?local government sanctuary
policy prohibition act?, as well as House Bill 4090, applicable to county
government, both of which undermine the safety and security of all
Detroiters and Michiganders; AND NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT
FINALLY

That copies of this resolution shall be transmitted to the Mayor and the
City?s lobbyists, the Governor and the Detroit delegation in the State
Legislature.

Resolution Opposing House Bill No. 4083 and 4090

 

I am requesting that the Legislative Policy Division drafts a resolution opposing House Bills N0. 4083
and 4090 which would negatively impact welcoming communities across Michigan. The bill prohibits
local law or policy that limits local police communication with Immigration and Customs
Enforcement (ICE) about a person?s immigration status, mandates onerous and problematic reporting
requirements on local governments, puts a tremendous burden on local law enforcement to train their
of?cers in correct interpretation of immigration law, and creates an incentive for racial pro?ling

Please let me know if you need any additional information. Thank you.

Re: Legal Representation and Indemnification in lawsuit of Johnny Strickland
City ofDetroit, Civil Action Case No: 18-cv-12640

 

On February 26, 2019, Your Honorable Body adopted a resolution regarding the
above-referenced matter, to deny representation and indemnification of Sergeant
Rodney Ballinger Badge No. 8-1071.

The past practice of City Council is to hold hearings for police officers who have been
denied representation, in accordance With arbitration awards issued by the Voluntary
Labor Arbitration Tribunal. After consultation with the Council President?s office,
the Law Department is respectfully requesting that a closed session be held on
Tuesday, April 16 at 1:00 p.m.

A request for a hearing was not triggered in this case because both the Law
Department and DPD recommended approval of representation and
indemnification. Sgt. Ballinger is entitled to receive and the City of Detroit is
required to hold this hearing.

BY COUNCIL MEMBER:

Required Hearings
Regarding Representation and Indemnification of

Section 7.5-203, Civil Litigation, of the 2012 Detroit City Charter
provides, in relevant part, that ?[upon request, the Corporation Counsel
may represent any officer or employee of the city in any action or
proceeding involving official duties[;l? and,

Section 13-1 1-5, Civil Service and Personnel Regulations, of the 1984
Detroit City Code provides, in pertinent part, that ?the city council shall
consider and determine whether the corporation counsel shall represent
the officer or employee in the matter and find and determine whether
or not the claim, demand or suit arises out of or involves the
performance in good faith of the official duties of such officer or
and,

Arbitration awards issued by the Voluntary Labor Arbitration Tribunal
recognize the past practice of City Council holding hearings for police
officers who have been denied representation (see Grievance Nos. 79-
237, 82-055, 90-047, and Now Therefore Be It

That, pursuant to the above and MCL closed sessions are to
be held on Tuesday, April 16, 2019 for the purpose of conducting

be discussed with Law Department attorneys, representatives from the
Detroit Police Department, Rodney Ballinger and counsel,
representatives from the Detroit Police Lieutenants and Sergeants
Association, as well as attorneys from the Legislative Policy Division;
and Be It Further

That the hearings are scheduled at 1:00 and Be It Finally
