 PERMIT REVIEW COMMITTEE REPORT TO
COMMISSION ON CHICAGO LANDMARKS
October 7, 2010
The Permit Review Committee (PRC) met on September 2, at 11:30 a.m. The meeting was held
at the Chicago Cultural Center at 78 East Washington, First Floor Garland Room.
Present:

Ben Weese
John Baird
Phyllis Ellin
Edward Torrez
Ernest Wong

Staff:

Brian Goeken, Deputy Commissioner, Historic Preservation Division, Department
of Zoning and Land Use Planning
Dijana Cuvalo
Lawrence Shure

The following projects were reviewed by the PRC:
1.

1652 North Leavitt
(Wicker Park District – 1st Ward)
Proposal:

Violation: Common-brick wall 100 feet in length along side property line,
between 4’-4¼“ (at front property line) to 4’-10¼“ in height

Action:

Approved 4-1 (John Baird voted against) with the following condition:
1. The solid masonry wall shall extend no further into the front of the
property than the leading edge of the projecting bay on the south
elevation of the adjacent greystone building to the north of the
property (see Attachment #1). The section of the masonry wall
already constructed in front of this point shall be removed or may be
replaced with an open metal fence no greater than 5’ in height, subject
to Historic Preservation staff review and approval. A permit shall be
obtained for the project. The permit drawings shall indicate the
dimension from the front property line to the beginning of the
reconfigured wall.
The Committee also noted that the construction of this wall was begun
without a permit and reiterated that all work must be approved and
permitted prior to work beginning. Failure to do so may result in denial of
the project, removing the unpermitted work, fines, and/or other penalties.
