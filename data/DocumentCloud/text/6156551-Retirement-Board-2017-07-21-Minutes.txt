The next order of business was review and adoption of Board orders as submitted by the Board’s counsel.
In the matter of Edward Bazar, the Board finds "Pursuant to 40 ILCS 5/5-214 and for all of the reasons
stated herein, Bazar has not established entitlement to the police pension service credit for the time period
December 13, 2004, through April 26, 2005, at which time he was employed as a police officer for the
City of St. Petersburg. As the statutory provision of the Act does not grant police pension service credit
for such service, Bazar’s request for police pension service credit for all or part of the time period
requested is, therefore, denied."
It was moved by Trustee Lappe, seconded by Trustee Wright that the Board approve the order on
Edward Bazar as submitted.

incident but that the injury was exacerbated by a preexisting physical defect or other disease. Therefore,

President Hauser read into the record a Resolution in honor of retiring Trustee Michael K. Lappe,
noting an inscribed version is forthcoming.
(WHEREUPON, Trustee Brown exited the meeting)
The Executive Director reviewed with the Board the following matters.
•

The Investment Committee meeting held Monday, July 17, 2017, was Trustee Maloney's last
Investment Committee meeting with the Fund. The Executive Director thanked him for his service
as the investment committee chair, recording secretary for that committee, and especially assuming
the role of Acting CIO for over one year. Thank you very much, Trustee Maloney.

•

An update on the election for Trustee Michael Lappe’s position was provided; the ballots have been
mailed, there are four candidates and ballots shall be counted on August 4, 2017.

•

An anonymous letter was received regarding a member on disability. It was noted that the Trustees
have already terminated such member’s disability benefits based upon a recent status hearing.

•

Trustee Maloney will be reaching mandatory retirement September 8, 2017, so his position on the
Board will be subject to election per the Illinois Statutes. In addition, Trustee Wright’s term will be
expiring November 30, 2017. A proposed schedule for the election to fill the two positions was
distributed to the Board for review. The date of the sufficiency hearing of September 14, 2017, 11am
was confirmed, along with the draft election schedule. A quorum on September 14, 2017, will be
required to approve the candidate’s petitions submitted and related ballots.

The next item is a request from a Jim Quaid, a partner at Ostrow, Reisin, Berk & Abrams, Ltd.
regarding the audit of the annuitant healthcare cost reconciliation that was performed by the City, for
the six months July 1, 2013, through December 31, 2013. This was not a budgeted item, as such
matter continues in the Court system. Historically, the Fund has paid this firm to conduct the audit
to confirm the information provided by the City. The audit is estimated at approximately $10,000.
It was moved by Trustee Maloney, seconded by Trustee Hamburger that the Board approve the expense to
conduct an independent audit on the annuitant healthcare reconciliation for the period cited.

The 2016 CAFR, (Comprehensive Annual Financial Report) for the Fund, and the actuarial
valuations as of December 31, 2016, were distributed to all Board members for their information and
review. Electronic copies are also available on the Fund’s website.

•

On July 7, 2017, the Fund received a call from the Fund’s storage vendor indicating that one of the
Fund’s storage locker padlocks was cut. The Executive Director went to that storage facility and
contacted Trustee Lappe. A responding officer and an evidence technician were called to the storage
facility. Based on the preliminary investigation and Fund’s staff additional analysis; it does not
appear that anything was taken. The youngest record contained in that unit was a record of a refund
issued in 1971. There were also two other units, unrelated to the Fund, that were broken into, so it
appears to be a random act of vandalism. Staff will begin to explore a difference process for storage
of the Fund’s documents. Fund staff has also been exploring the retention and destruction of
participant’s records. Application with the State of Illinois concerning the Fund’s obligation on the
retention of records and documents was completed. Participant’s applications have a permanent
period of retention, and cannot be destroyed. Any documents that accompany a participant’s
application must be retained at least seven years after the last payment is made to the member and
his/her beneficiaries. Thus, there is a very long State of Illinois required retention period for Fund
documents.

•

The last item was an email from Trustee Wright, who was contacted by attorney Paul Geiger. Mr.
Geiger is the court-appointed class counsel for a retro class action brought by Officer Robert

Bartlett that recently settled with the City. The agreement includes an extension of time for
officers and retirees covered by the settlement to cash their checks from July 25th to August
11th. Mr. Geiger is requesting confirmation of the mailing addresses of members identified
that still have funds due to them. The Board approved confirming addresses with
information provided by Mr. Geiger, however, if a different address exists, Fund staff will
contact the member and communicate this information. Such member’s address would not
be provided to Mr. Geiger without his/her consent.
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR’S REPORT CONCLUDED
All business concluded for this date, July 21, 2017, it was moved by Trustee Maloney, seconded by Trustee
Summers that this meeting be adjourned.
