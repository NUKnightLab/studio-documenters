PROPOSED AGREEMENT
Transmitting a Communication, dated July 1, 2009 from
TODD H. STROGER, President, Cook County Board of Commissioners
Re:

Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP2)

I respectfully request approval for Cook County, Illinois to enter into a Consortium Agreement with the
Chicago Metropolitan Area for Planning (CMAP), local governments and non-profits for the purposes of
applying to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for the competitive
application round of the Neighborhood Stabilization Program know as NSP2. This round of funding is
made available under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA).
When the ARRA was enacted, CMAP convened a group of counties, municipalities and non-profit
organizations in the Chicago region to discuss the advantages of applying for NSP2 funding on a regional
basis. Out of these discussions, a number of these local governments and non-profits have joined a
consortium for the purpose of developing a regional strategy for deployment of NSP2 funds. I recommend
that Cook County join this consortium, as it offers the strongest possible application for these
competitively awarded funds. The NSP2 funds will be directed to stabilizing neighborhoods whose
viability has been and continues to be damaged by the economic effects of foreclosed and abandoned
properties. I recommend that Cook County join this consortium for purposes of joint application and
funding among the members, as it will make northeastern Illinois more competitive for NSP2 dollars and
will allow the region to create efficiencies and build economies of scale when implementing the program.
While CMAP will be the lead agency when applying for NSP2 funds, program implementation will rest
solely with the County of Cook, relative to its geographical boundaries.
I respectfully request approval for the County to join the consortium in pursuing these available federal
funds and that I or the Chief of the Bureau of Capital, Planning and Facilities Management or his
designee, is authorized to execute on behalf of the County of Cook, the Consortium Agreement, to be
effective as of July 13, 2009, and any and all additional documents necessary further the activity approved
herein. The approval of this agreement by this Honorable Body will permit staff to execute the necessary
documentation to move this application forward.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 2, 2009
ORDINANCE
Transmitting a Communication, dated June 25, 2009 from
JOSEPH M. FRATTO, Chief Financial Officer, Bureau of Finance
transmitting herewith for your consideration is a Proposed Ordinance designating a recovery zone in and
for the County of Cook, Illinois.
On September, 17 2008, the Board of Commissioners adopted an ordinance authorizing one or more
series of general obligation bonds (the “Master Bond Ordinance”) to finance, among other things, the
Public Safety Funds Project, the Health Fund Project, the Corporate Fund Project and the Capital
Equipment Project (said portion of the proposed bonds being the “Project Bonds”).
On February 17, 2009, the Congress of the United States enacted the American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the “Stimulus Act”), which authorizes the issuance of “build America bonds.”
“Build America bonds” are eligible for a direct payment by the United States Treasury to the issuer of
35% of the interest coming due on the bonds.
On June 8, 2009, the Board amended the Master Bond Ordinance to provide for the designation of some
or all of the Project Bonds as “build America bonds” so as to receive the 35% subsidy.
The Stimulus Act also provides that if certain requirements are met, “build America bonds” can be further
designated as “recovery zone economic development bonds.” “Recovery zone economic development
bonds” are eligible for a direct payment by the United States Treasury to the issuer of 45% of the interest
due on the bonds instead of the otherwise applicable 35%.
To designate “build America bonds” as “recovery zone economic development bonds” the Stimulus Act
requires (i) the Secretary of the United States Treasury to have awarded the issuer a portion of a
nationwide volume limitation and (ii) the issuer to have designated a “recovery zone,” in each case prior
to issuing the bonds.
On June 12, 2009, the Secretary of the United States Treasury awarded the County an allocation of
$131,209,000 for “recovery zone economic development bonds.”
On June, 18 2009, the County entered into a bond purchase agreement providing for the issuance on July
7, 2009, of $251,410,000 Taxable General Obligation Bonds, Series 2009B (Build America Bonds Direct Payment) (the “Series 2009B Bonds”), which are eligible to receive the 35% subsidy.
To designate a portion of the Series 2009B Bonds as “recovery zone economic development bonds” in
order to receive a 45% subsidy for that portion (instead of the otherwise applicable 35% subsidy), the
Board is now requested to designate a recovery zone, as provided in the proposed Ordinance.
Please note, the County also received an allocation of $196,814,000 for “recovery zone facility bonds,” a
new category of tax-exempt bonds (similar to industrial development revenue bonds). Designation of the
recovery zone is also a condition precedent to the issuance of such bonds, should the County decide to do
so at a later date.
Approval of the Ordinance designating the County of Cook a recovery zone is hereby requested.

issuance of one or more series of general obligation bonds of the County (the “Master Bond Ordinance”)
to provide for the payment, inter alia, of certain capital expenditures in and for the County; and
WHEREAS, in order to assist state and local governments in financing capital projects at lower
borrowing costs and to stimulate the economy and create jobs, on the 17th day of February, 2009, the
Congress of the United States enacted the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the
“Stimulus Act”) which act authorizes, inter alia, the issuance of “build America bonds” for the payment
of capital expenditures; and
WHEREAS, if such bonds meet certain conditions as set forth in the Stimulus Act, “build America
bonds” are eligible for a direct payment by the United States Treasury to the issuer of thirty-five percent
(35%) of the interest coming due thereon, thereby affording potential economic benefits to the issuer of
such bonds; and
WHEREAS, on the 2nd day of June, 2009, the Corporate Authorities amended the Master Bond
Ordinance specifically to authorize the issuance of one or more series of the County’s general obligation
bonds as “build America bonds;” and
WHEREAS, on the 18th day of June, 2009, the County entered into a bond purchase agreement for
$251,410,000 Taxable General Obligation Bonds, Series 2009B (Build America - Direct Payment) (the
“Series 2009B Bonds”), which bonds are to be issued on July 7, 2009, and all of which bonds qualify as
“build America bonds” that are eligible for a direct payment to the County by the United States Treasury
of thirty-five percent (35%) of the interest coming due thereon; and
WHEREAS, a bond that qualifies as a “build America bond” under the Stimulus Act may further qualify
to be designated as a “recovery zone economic development bond;” and
WHEREAS, bonds which are designated prior to their issuance by the issuer as “recovery zone economic
development bonds” are eligible for a direct payment by the United States Treasury to the issuer of fortyfive percent (45%) of the interest coming due thereon instead of the thirty-five percent (35%) otherwise
payable; and
WHEREAS, the Stimulus Act also authorizes the issuance of “recovery zone facility bonds,” which are a
new category of exempt facility bonds eligible to be issued as tax exempt bonds under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and which, although they are not eligible for a direct payment by the
United States Treasury to the issuer of an interest subsidy, nevertheless afford certain potential economic
benefits to the issuer of such bonds; and

must be used to pay for one or more “qualified economic development purposes” in a “recovery zone”
designated by the issuer, each as defined in the Stimulus Act; and
WHEREAS, “qualified economic development purposes,” as defined in the Stimulus Act, include
expenditures for public infrastructure and construction of public facilities; and

recovery zone facility bonds can only be issued by a State or local government pursuant to an allocation
by the Secretary of the Treasury (the “Secretary”) of a portion of a nationwide volume limitation; and

Public Safety Funds Project, the Health Fund Project, the Corporate Fund Project and the Capital
Equipment Project, in each case as approved to date by action of the Corporate Authorities, include
capital expenditures for public infrastructure and construction of public facilities, and therefore said
projects qualify as “qualified economic development purposes” under the Stimulus Act; and
WHEREAS, the Corporate Authorities are generally familiar with the conditions now extant in the
County; and
WHEREAS, the Corporate Authorities have heretofore, and it hereby expressly is, determined that the
County has experienced and is now experiencing significant poverty, unemployment, rate of home
foreclosures and general distress (being, generally, the “Recovery Zone Conditions”), with a resulting
decline of the County which impairs the value of private investments and threatens the sound growth of
the County and threatens the health, safety, morals and welfare of the public; and
WHEREAS, on the 12th day of June, 2009, the Secretary released Notice 2009-50, which sets forth the
maximum amounts of recovery zone economic development bonds and recovery zone facility bonds that
may be issued by each State, county and large municipality under the Stimulus Act; and
WHEREAS, the Secretary has awarded the County an allocation of $131,209,000 for recovery zone
economic development bonds (being the “Recovery Zone Economic Development Bond Allocation”) and
an allocation of $196,814,000 for recovery zone facility bonds; and
WHEREAS, the Corporate Authorities have heretofore, and it hereby expressly is, determined that in
order to promote and protect the value of private investments in and the sound growth of the County and
the health, safety, morals and welfare of the public that such Recovery Zone Conditions must be
ameliorated; and
WHEREAS, the Corporate Authorities have heretofore, and it hereby is, determined that the use of the
several incentives available to the County under the Stimulus Act may be advisable and necessary to
ameliorate the Recovery Zone Conditions; and

RESOLUTION
Sponsored by
THE HONORABLE TODD H. STROGER
PRESIDENT OF THE COOK COUNTY BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS
WHEREAS, the Cook County Health & Hospitals System is comprised of three public hospitals and
numerous health clinics that provide care to the uninsured, the underinsured and those in need in Cook
County and across northeastern Illinois; and
WHEREAS, like other public safety net hospitals across our country, the large majority of the system’s
patients are either Medicaid-eligible or uninsured; and
WHEREAS, the United States Congress has begun debate on national health care reform to ensure, as
much as possible, that the people of the United States have the ability to obtain quality and affordable
health care when needed; and
WHEREAS, this elected body fully supports the expansion of health care coverage to all in the 111th
Congress of the United States of America; and
WHEREAS, the nation’s public health infrastructure at all governmental levels must be strengthened
with sustained funding to expand the delivery of effective preventive services; and
WHEREAS, hospitals across the United States of America that treat a large number of low-income
patients qualify for “Disproportionate Share Hospital” (DSH) payments to compensate for higher-thanaverage costs generated by uninsured and underinsured patients; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Health & Hospitals System is a major recipient of Medicaid
Disproportionate Share funds, allowing it to remain the backbone of the safety net care network in
northeastern Illinois, helping to pay for the uninsured and Medicaid underpayments in the Cook County
Health & Hospitals System; and

2029

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 2, 2009
WHEREAS, Medicaid Disproportionate Share payments have come under scrutiny by members of the
United States Congress as an unnecessary component of health care reform; and
WHEREAS, proposals to eliminate or greatly reduce disproportionate share payments to hospitals have
been offered during the debate on health care reform, including one to reduce the program by 75% by
2019.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and the Board of Commissioners hereby
urge the Honorable Members of the Illinois Congressional Delegation to reject all proposals to reduce
Medicaid DSH cuts as part of health reform to ensure the stability of the fragile health care safety net
system during this time of health reform transition; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Illinois Congressional Delegation seek an evaluation of health
reform and its impact on the Cook County Health & Hospitals System, including its uncompensated care
costs and its Medicaid payments after a suitable period to determine what, if any, changes should be made
to the Medicaid DSH program; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a suitable copy of this Resolution be delivered to the Honorable
Members of the Illinois Congressional Delegation.
Approved and adopted this 2nd day of July 2009.

exceptions described in Subsections (b)(1) and (2) of this section applies, the hearing officer shall enter an
order finding the owner of record of the vehicle civilly liable to the County for an administrative penalty
in the amount of $500.00. If the owner of record fails to appear at the hearing, the hearing officer shall
enter a default order in favor of the County requiring the payment to the County of an administrative
penalty in the amount of $500.00. If the hearing officer finds that no such violation occurred, the hearing
officer shall order the immediate return of the owner's vehicle or cash bond.
(f)
Administrative penalty constitutes debt owing to County. If an administrative penalty is
imposed pursuant to this division, such penalty shall constitute a debt due and owing to the County. If a
cash bond has been posted pursuant to this division, the bond shall be applied to the penalty. If a vehicle
has been impounded when such a penalty is imposed, the County may seek to obtain judgment against the
vehicle or enforce such judgment against the vehicle as provided by law. Except as provided otherwise in
this division, a vehicle shall continue to be impounded until:

2040

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 2, 2009
(1)

The penalty, plus any applicable towing and storage fees, is paid to the County, in which
case possession of the vehicle shall be given to the person who is legally entitled to
possess the vehicle; or

(2)

The vehicle is sold or otherwise disposed of to satisfy a judgment or enforce a lien as
provided by law. If the administrative penalty and applicable fees are not paid within 30
days after an administrative penalty is imposed under Subsection (e) of this section
against an owner of record who defaults by failing to appear at the hearing, the vehicle
shall be deemed unclaimed and shall be disposed of in the manner provided for by law
for the disposition of unclaimed vehicles. In all other cases, if the administrative penalty
and applicable fees are not paid within 30 days after the expiration of time at which
administrative review of the hearing officer's determination may be sought, or within 30
days after an action seeking administrative review has been resolved in favor of the
County, whichever is applicable, the vehicle shall be deemed unclaimed and shall be
disposed of in the manner provided by law for the disposition of unclaimed vehicles.

(g)
Except as otherwise specifically provided by law or this ordinance, no owner, lien holder
or other person shall be legally entitled to take possession of a vehicle impounded under this section until
the civil penalty and fees applicable under this division have been paid. However, whenever a person with
a lien of record against an impounded vehicle has commenced foreclosure proceedings, possession of the
vehicle shall be given to that person if the person agrees in writing to refund to the County the amount of
the net proceeds of any foreclosure sale, less any amounts required to pay all lien holders of record, up to
$500.00 plus the applicable fees. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a lien holder shall be entitled to take
possession of a vehicle impounded under this section by deferring payment of the civil penalty and fees
applicable under this division upon submission of the following information to the Sheriff or his
designated agent on a form provided for that purpose:
(1)

A copy of Certificate of Title or other competent evidence to demonstrate the filing of the
lien with the Illinois Secretary of State or other applicable governmental entity which
document shall be certified as a true and correct copy of such document under notary
seal; and

(2)

A copy of the installment sales or loan agreement related to the vehicle which document
shall be certified as a true and correct copy of such document under notary seal; and

(3)

A sworn statement that the owner/purchaser of the vehicle is in default and that the lien
holder has a right under the agreement to reprocess or otherwise foreclose on its lien and
that it is repossessing and foreclosing on its lien; and

(4)

A notarized agreement to indemnify and hold harmless the County, the Sheriff and their
agents for the release of the vehicle to the lien holder; and

(5)

A written agreement in which the lien holder agrees that it shall conditionally pay to the
County up to the sum of the civil penalty and fees applicable under this division from any
“Surplus” upon the lien holder’s receipt of the funds from the repossession sale of the
vehicle pursuant to the Illinois Uniform Commercial Code. The amount of the “Surplus”
shall be as defined pursuant to 810 ILCS 5/9-615. The written agreement shall further
provide that in the event that the foreclosure sale does not yield enough to pay the full
amount owed to the County, then the lien holder shall pay the County as much as is
available from the surplus, if any, and the lien holder shall not shall not have any further
liability to the County for such sums. The written agreement shall further provide that if

2041

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 2, 2009
the lien holder is required to allow the owner/purchaser to redeem or reinstate the vehicle
and/or contract under applicable law, than the amount of the civil penalty and fees
applicable under this division shall be due and owning by the owner/purchaser as an
expense of retaking, holding, preparing for disposition, processing or disposing as
provided in 810 ILCS 5/9-615 and the lien holder shall collect such sum from the
owner/purchaser and pay it to the County as a condition of allowing such redemption or
re-instatement, unless the owner/purchaser presents a statement from the County or its
agent showing that such sum or any part of it has been satisfied, waived or found
inapplicable.
(h)
Upon the request of a lien holder to obtain possession of a vehicle impounded under this
section, the County, the Sheriff or their agent shall provide a lien holder with a statement setting forth the
amount of the civil penalty and fees applicable under this division.

important that any measure makes deliberate and responsible reforms to our healthcare system and
reinforces the strength of American healthcare while addressing the shortcomings; and

2042

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 2, 2009
WHEREAS, access to health care must be expanded by making health insurance more affordable and
giving Americans more options and control over their health care decisions. Reform must improve the
quality of care by focusing on prevention and wellness, employing technologies to reduce errors and
promoting medical breakthroughs; and
WHEREAS, the operation of Cook County’s safety net hospital and clinic system is nearly 40% of the
Cook County operating budget.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board endorses reforms of the

ROBERTO MALDONADO, County Commissioner
Re:

A Resolution Urging Immediate Passage of Comprehensive Federal Health Reform Legislation

submitting a Resolution supporting passage of comprehensive federal health reform to restore the
partnership between counties and the federal government and ensure access to affordable, quality health
care for all. The National Association of County Officials’ (NACo) Health Steering Committee, of which
I am a member, approved the report, Restoring the Partnership for American Health: Counties in a 21st
Century Health System (submitted), at the NACo Legislative Conference in March.
The
recommendations of that report are incorporated in this resolution.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
A RESOLUTION URGING IMMEDIATE PASSAGE OF
COMPREHENSIVE FEDERAL HEALTH REFORM LEGISLATION
WHEREAS, experts from across the political spectrum agree that America’s health system is “broken”
and unsustainable in its present configuration; and
WHEREAS, families in Cook County are experiencing this crisis right now, confronting the high cost of
health care that threatens their financial stability, leaves them exposed to higher premiums and
deductibles, and puts them at risk for a possible loss of health insurance; and
WHEREAS, employer-sponsored health insurance premiums have nearly doubled in recent years making
it increasingly difficult for employers, including county governments, to provide health insurance
coverage for their employees and retirees; and
WHEREAS, millions of Americans do not have health coverage, or have inadequate coverage and as our
economic challenges multiply, the problem of health care access grows, further straining counties’
capacity to provide care for the uninsured, underinsured and medically indigent; and
WHEREAS, according to 2007 U.S. Census Bureau data, 1.2 million individuals living in the City of
Chicago and the surrounding Metropolitan Area are uninsured, and while the majority of these individuals
are working, fully 41% earn just $25,000 or less and they cannot afford private health coverage; and
WHEREAS, county officials are elected to protect the health and welfare of their constituents; and
WHEREAS, Cook County’s Health & Hospitals System is the largest provider of indigent care in the
County and the State, currently spending more than half - 55.5% - of its total expenditures in delivering
care to the uninsured who do not have the ability to pay for their medical services. As such, the County
does not receive payment for the overwhelming majority of this care, but, rather, it is subsidized by
County taxpayers; and
WHEREAS, the National Association of Counties (NACo) Health System Reform Working Group,
appointed by President Don Stapley in July 2008 and chaired by President-Elect Valerie Brown, has held
three regional hearings to explore the health crisis and to hear what county officials believe should be
done about it and has summarized its findings in Restoring the Partnership for American Health:
Counties in a 21st Century Health System which was approved and adopted by resolution of the NACo
Health Steering Committee and Board of Directors on March 9, 2009.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners endorses
NACo’s health reform principles, as summarized in Restoring the Partnership for American Health:
Counties in a 21st Century Health System; namely, that reform legislation should:

2044

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 2, 2009
a. restore the partnership between county and federal governments;
b. provide access to affordable, quality health care to all;
c. invest in public health, including health promotion and disease and injury prevention;
d. stabilize and strengthen the local health care safety net system, especially Medicaid and
Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) payments;
e. invest in the development of the health professional and paraprofessional workforce;
f.

ensure that county health agencies have the resources to meaningfully use health information
technology;

g. enable elderly and disabled persons to receive the services they need in the least restrictive
environment; and
h. reform the delivery and financing of health services in the jail system.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Board strongly urges the 111th Congress of the United States
to enact comprehensive health reform legislation without delay before the end of its first session.

WHEREAS, in an effort to streamline County government and prevent further economic
hardship on County residents, the Cook County Board of Commissioners implemented
budgetary cuts in the 2007 fiscal year with an on average seventeen percent (17%)
countywide budgetary reduction; and
WHEREAS, Cook County has a structural deficit and due to County Board approved
appropriations and contractual obligations, the Board of Cook County Commissioners
acknowledged the need for additional revenue and increased County revenue in a manner that
would afford adequate funding to maintain essential services; and
WHEREAS, as a home rule county, County of Cook is authorized by 55 ILCS 5/5-1006 to
impose a tax upon all persons in Cook County engaged in the business of selling tangible

quarter percent (.25%); and

Cook County’s increased sales tax, those Townships voiced their concern and though such

opinions of the voters be acknowledged and heard; and

OFFICE OF CAPITAL PLANNING AND POLICY
PURCHASE ORDER ADDENDUM

BRUCE WASHINGTON, Director, Office of Capital Planning and Policy
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to increase by $20,000.00, Purchase Order No. 167209

Original Purchase Order amount issued 05-08-09:

PROPOSED CHANGE ORDER
Transmitting a Communication, dated June 8, 2009 from
BRUCE WASHINGTON, Director, Office of Capital Planning and Policy
transmitted herewith for your approval is Change Order No. 1 in the amount of $2,515,950.00 to the
contract with Roula Associates Architects, Chicago, Illinois, Architect for the New Residential Treatment
Unit (RTU) and Reception Classification Diagnostic Center (RCDC) Project at the Department of
Corrections. It is respectfully requested that this Honorable Body approve this request.

2164

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 2, 2009
Reason:

During the programming phase, it was determined that the using agencies required additional
square footage to meet their needs and to address specific requirements of the
U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) report on conditions at Cook County Jail. In response to
that report, modifications were made to the original program. This will require a significantly
increased design effort on the part of the Architectural and Engineering (A/E) team.
Additional program elements and space are required, which translates into additional project
costs. Some of these program requirements include increased hardening of the facility,
additional security glazing to increase visual supervision, body scanners to reduce strip
searches, and the inclusion of a pneumatic tube system to improve efficiency of medication
delivery.
In addition, the original site had to be changed so that the new building would be adjacent to
Cermak Health Services of Cook County. This will decrease detainee transport distance to
assigned divisions, allow for reduced redundancy in the new building and better staff
efficiency. Surveys of the new site confirmed additional underground utilities, which must be
relocated and will require additional design effort. Also, due to the proximity of the new site
to existing buildings, increased construction phasing and protection of adjacent foundations
must be designed.
The overall project budget was increased during the Capital Improvement Program hearings
and the A/E fee adjustment is recommended due to that increase.
This is categorized as a Public Safety Capital Project.

Information Strategies, Inc., Washington, D.C., (in partnership with Microsoft) to implement the
Microsoft Stimulus 360 Solution to properly track, monitor and report on the County’s programs funded
under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA).
Reason:

ARRA funds are intended to be utilized “as quickly as possible consistent with prudent
management.” ARRA funds require very stringent monitoring and reporting of expenditures
and results. The Microsoft Stimulus 360 Solution provides the most complete tracking and
reporting package for ARRA funds, and can be implemented within 2 to 4 weeks of contract
execution, due to the existing relationship between Information Strategies, Inc. and
Microsoft. This package has been selected by the State of Illinois and the City of Chicago, in
addition to many other governmental entities nationwide for the efficient and proper
managing of ARRA funds, and using it will enable the County to work more efficiently with
the State to assure compliance with federal requirements.

This contract is in accordance with the Cook County Procurement Joint Purchasing Requirement. The
City of Chicago obtained competitive proposals from three firms and selected Information Strategies, Inc.
as offering the best combination of price and speed to implementation.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: $30,000.00. Contract period: July 2, 2009 through July 1, 2011. (490-260

This increase and extension is requested in order to acquire the software to implement the
Microsoft Stimulus 360 Solution to track and report all funds received by the County of Cook
under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). This software solution will
enable Cook County to quickly mobilize, and to properly manage, track and report on

capabilities, as well as compatibility with the County’s existing technologies. This software
has been acquired by both the City of Chicago and the State of Illinois, and can be

ORDINANCE
Transmitting a Communication, dated June 25, 2009 from
JOSEPH M. FRATTO, Chief Financial Officer, Bureau of Finance
transmitting herewith for your consideration is a Proposed Ordinance designating a recovery zone in and
for the County of Cook, Illinois.
On September, 17 2008, the Board of Commissioners adopted an ordinance authorizing one or more
series of general obligation bonds (the “Master Bond Ordinance”) to finance, among other things, the
Public Safety Funds Project, the Health Fund Project, the Corporate Fund Project and the Capital
Equipment Project (said portion of the proposed bonds being the “Project Bonds”).
On February 17, 2009, the Congress of the United States enacted the American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the “Stimulus Act”), which authorizes the issuance of “build America bonds.”
“Build America bonds” are eligible for a direct payment by the United States Treasury to the issuer of
35% of the interest coming due on the bonds.
On June 8, 2009, the Board amended the Master Bond Ordinance to provide for the designation of some
or all of the Project Bonds as “build America bonds” so as to receive the 35% subsidy.

2173

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 2, 2009
The Stimulus Act also provides that if certain requirements are met, “build America bonds” can be further
designated as “recovery zone economic development bonds.” “Recovery zone economic development
bonds” are eligible for a direct payment by the United States Treasury to the issuer of 45% of the interest
due on the bonds instead of the otherwise applicable 35%.
To designate “build America bonds” as “recovery zone economic development bonds” the Stimulus Act
requires (i) the Secretary of the United States Treasury to have awarded the issuer a portion of a
nationwide volume limitation and (ii) the issuer to have designated a “recovery zone,” in each case prior
to issuing the bonds.
On June 12, 2009, the Secretary of the United States Treasury awarded the County an allocation of
$131,209,000 for “recovery zone economic development bonds.”
On June, 18 2009, the County entered into a bond purchase agreement providing for the issuance on July
7, 2009, of $251,410,000 Taxable General Obligation Bonds, Series 2009B (Build America Bonds Direct Payment) (the “Series 2009B Bonds”), which are eligible to receive the 35% subsidy.
To designate a portion of the Series 2009B Bonds as “recovery zone economic development bonds” in
order to receive a 45% subsidy for that portion (instead of the otherwise applicable 35% subsidy), the
Board is now requested to designate a recovery zone, as provided in the proposed Ordinance.
Please note, the County also received an allocation of $196,814,000 for “recovery zone facility bonds,” a
new category of tax-exempt bonds (similar to industrial development revenue bonds). Designation of the
recovery zone is also a condition precedent to the issuance of such bonds, should the County decide to do
so at a later date.
Approval of the Ordinance designating the County of Cook a recovery zone is hereby requested.

THE HONORABLE TODD H. STROGER

Congress of the United States enacted the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the
“Stimulus Act”) which act authorizes, inter alia, the issuance of “build America bonds” for the payment
of capital expenditures; and

2174

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 2, 2009
WHEREAS, if such bonds meet certain conditions as set forth in the Stimulus Act, “build America
bonds” are eligible for a direct payment by the United States Treasury to the issuer of thirty-five percent
(35%) of the interest coming due thereon, thereby affording potential economic benefits to the issuer of
such bonds; and
WHEREAS, on the 2nd day of June, 2009, the Corporate Authorities amended the Master Bond
Ordinance specifically to authorize the issuance of one or more series of the County’s general obligation
bonds as “build America bonds;” and
WHEREAS, on the 18th day of June, 2009, the County entered into a bond purchase agreement for
$251,410,000 Taxable General Obligation Bonds, Series 2009B (Build America - Direct Payment) (the
“Series 2009B Bonds”), which bonds are to be issued on July 7, 2009, and all of which bonds qualify as
“build America bonds” that are eligible for a direct payment to the County by the United States Treasury
of thirty-five percent (35%) of the interest coming due thereon; and
WHEREAS, a bond that qualifies as a “build America bond” under the Stimulus Act may further qualify
to be designated as a “recovery zone economic development bond;” and
WHEREAS, bonds which are designated prior to their issuance by the issuer as “recovery zone economic
development bonds” are eligible for a direct payment by the United States Treasury to the issuer of fortyfive percent (45%) of the interest coming due thereon instead of the thirty-five percent (35%) otherwise
payable; and
WHEREAS, the Stimulus Act also authorizes the issuance of “recovery zone facility bonds,” which are a
new category of exempt facility bonds eligible to be issued as tax exempt bonds under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and which, although they are not eligible for a direct payment by the
United States Treasury to the issuer of an interest subsidy, nevertheless afford certain potential economic
benefits to the issuer of such bonds; and
WHEREAS, pursuant to the Stimulus Act the proceeds of recovery zone economic development bonds
must be used to pay for one or more “qualified economic development purposes” in a “recovery zone”
designated by the issuer, each as defined in the Stimulus Act; and
WHEREAS, “qualified economic development purposes,” as defined in the Stimulus Act, include
expenditures for public infrastructure and construction of public facilities; and
WHEREAS, “recovery zone” is defined in the Stimulus Act as an area (i) having significant poverty,
unemployment, rate of home foreclosures or general distress, (ii) which has been designated by the issuer
as economically distressed by reason of military base closure or realignment pursuant to the Defense Base
Closure and Realignment Act of 1990, or (iii) which had been designated as an empowerment zone or a
renewal community on the date the Stimulus Act was enacted; and
WHEREAS, the Stimulus Act further requires that recovery zone economic development bonds and
recovery zone facility bonds can only be issued by a State or local government pursuant to an allocation
by the Secretary of the Treasury (the “Secretary”) of a portion of a nationwide volume limitation; and
WHEREAS, the Corporate Authorities have heretofore, and it hereby expressly is, determined that the
Public Safety Funds Project, the Health Fund Project, the Corporate Fund Project and the Capital
Equipment Project, in each case as approved to date by action of the Corporate Authorities, include
capital expenditures for public infrastructure and construction of public facilities, and therefore said
projects qualify as “qualified economic development purposes” under the Stimulus Act; and

2175

County; and

economic development bonds (being the “Recovery Zone Economic Development Bond Allocation”) and
an allocation of $196,814,000 for recovery zone facility bonds; and

order to promote and protect the value of private investments in and the sound growth of the County and
the health, safety, morals and welfare of the public that such Recovery Zone Conditions must be
ameliorated; and
WHEREAS, the Corporate Authorities have heretofore, and it hereby is, determined that the use of the
several incentives available to the County under the Stimulus Act may be advisable and necessary to
ameliorate the Recovery Zone Conditions; and

issue recovery zone economic development bonds and recovery zone facility bonds is scheduled to expire
on December 31, 2010; and
WHEREAS, in order to avail itself of the benefits of the Stimulus Act, including, specifically, the right to

PROPOSED CHANGE IN PLANS AND EXTRA WORK
Transmitting a Communication, dated June 8, 2009 from
RUPERT F. GRAHAM, JR., P.E., Superintendent of Highways
Re: Change in Plans and Extra Work
I herewith present the following recommendation for change in plans and extra work involved on this
improvement in the City of Country Club Hills and unincorporated Cook County in County Board
Districts #5 and 6.

SECTION

DESCRIPTION

AMOUNT

07-B6526-01-FP
Flossmoor Road,
Ridgeland Avenue to Cicero Avenue

Adjustment of quantities and
new items

$15.92
(Deduction)

The quantities as shown on the contract documents were estimated for bidding purposes only. This
change represents the difference between the estimated quantities and actual field quantities of work
performed with a large savings due to partial elimination of cold recycled bituminous base course, which
was replaced by Hot-In-Place Heater Scarification and Asphalt Modifier.
New items were added for work related to patching, aggregate base, and change in guardrail standard as
required per field conditions. Also, emergency resurfacing on nearby Holbrook Road, which is the east
extension of County Route B65 (Flossmoor Road) from Dixie Highway to Halsted Street, was an addition
to the scope of work on this project.
I respectfully recommend approval by your Honorable Body.

political subdivision or by any one under contract for public works," approved June 26, 1941, as
amended, the general prevailing rate of wages in this locality for laborers, mechanics and other workers
engaged in the construction of public works coming under the jurisdiction of this County is hereby
ascertained to be the same as the prevailing rate of wages for construction work in the Cook County area
as determined by the Department of Labor of the State of Illinois as of June 2009, a copy of that
determination being submitted hereto and incorporated herein by reference. As required by said Act, any
and all revisions of the prevailing rate of wages by the Department of Labor of the State of Illinois shall
supersede the Department's June determination and apply to any and all public works construction
undertaken by the County of Cook. The Definition of any terms appearing in this Ordinance which are
also used in aforesaid Act shall be the same as in said Act.
Section 2.
Nothing herein contained shall be construed to apply said general prevailing rate of
wages as herein ascertained to any work or employment except public works construction of this County
to the extent required by the aforesaid Act.
Section 3.
The Bureau of Human Resources shall publicly post or keep available for inspection by
any interested party in the main office of this Bureau of Human Resources (County) this determination or

whose wages will be affected by such rates.
Section 5.
The Bureau of Human Resources shall promptly file a certified copy of this Ordinance
with both the Secretary of State Index Division and the Department of Labor of the State of Illinois.
Section 6.
The Bureau of Human Resources shall cause to be published in a newspaper of general
