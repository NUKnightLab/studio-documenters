Report from Chair of the Board
Chair Hammock stated that the budget season has officially started. He encouraged the Directors to think about
what they feel are the organization’s strengths and weaknesses in the coming year, and how to align the finances
to address those issues. The Board needs to be prepared to set the priorities of the organization’s major
engagements. There is a capable finance team that can work out the numbers, but the Board has to endorse and
guide them on what is important.
The proposed FY2019 Preliminary Budget is expected to be presented to the Finance Committee on August 24th;
public hearings will be held prior to the Board’s consideration of the budget on August 31st.
Chair Hammock informed the Directors that President Preckwinkle is in the process of interviewing prospective
candidates for upcoming vacancies on the CCHHS Board of Directors. Further information on the status is
expected to be provided near the end of August or early September.

detain the offender until Chicago Police arrived at the gas station.

Dr. Pilar Guerrero, an emergency medicine physician at Cook County Health Hospitals System, was selected to be
featured in the Negocr'os Now 2018 Who's Who in Hispanic Chicago for Health Care. Dr. Guerrero was chosen for the

Dr. Sybil Hosek, a clinical and HIV researcher has long been involved in critically important research at
Most recently, one of the studies Dr. Hosek was lead author on was published in JAMA Pediatrics in September,
showing that the only HIV-prevention drug currently available on the market is well-tolerated by 15? to 17-year-old
young men who were HIV negative. Her study was one of the factors that led to the FDA expanding access to this HIV-
prevention drug, so that adolescents are now included. This is important because adolescents between the ages of 13
and 24 have one of the highest rates of new HIV infection. The drug, which is called or Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis,
was previously only approved for adults over the age of 18.

The letter reads ?Thank you much for all your lovely care. You were there when was in pain and I saw so much
compassion and love in your heart. You definitely made me feel better and protected. You care so much and I was able
to see God?s favor in you. You were my nurse and my mom here in this room. I thank God for your life and letting me be
your patient. God always reminds me of his protection by sending angels like you.?

a Food As Medicine Update

Through July 5, 2018 Fresh Truck partnership with the Greater Chicago Food Depository (GCFD) has
resulted in 122 visits to 12 health centers Austin, Cicero, the CORE Center, Cottage Grove, Englewood,
Logan Square, Near South, Oak Forest, Prieto, Robbins, Woodlawn, and Provident/Sengstacke. The move to a
permanent Vista Health Center location has delayed the staff training and start date for the Fresh Truck, which is
now expected to take place by the end of Q3 of 2018. Collectively, the Fresh Truck distributions have resulted in
the provision of fresh fruits and vegetables to 15,132 individuals, representing 50,172 household members.
Most of the individuals benefiting from the Fresh Truck screened positive for food insecurity at a health
center visit.

Three (3) health centers are once again hosting Summer Meals, a program for children 18 years and
younger to get free, healthy meals during the months when school is not in session. Cottage Grove, Englewood,

Legislative Update

Local
0 On July 23-24, 2018 the Cook County Finance Committee held mid-year budget hearings. The purpose of the
meetings was for each Cook County office and agency to update Commissioners on the status of their respective
FY18 year-end projections and to discuss their FY19 proposed budgets. indicated efforts are underway
to mitigate the deficit projected in the President?s FY2018 Preliminary Forecast. also indicated
expectation ofa level County Health Fund Allocation in FY2019.

State

0 Governor Rauner appointed State Representative Patricia ?Patti" Bellock as the permanent Director of the
Department of Healthcare and Family Services. Director Bellock Representative had served in the Illinois
House since 1999 and was a leader in her caucus on Medicaid and human services issues; Bellock announced last
year that she planned to retire from the Illinois General Assembly and would not be seek re-election. The
appointment was effective July 11, 2018.

I Representative Tom Demmer (R-90) was appointed to serve as the House Deputy Republican Leader.
Representative Demmer has served since 2013 and has played lead roles in Medicaid negotiations and most
recently, negotiating the new hospital assessment program. His district office is located in Rochelle, IL and he
also serves as the Director of Innovation and Strategy and KSB Hospital in Dixon.

0 The Illinois General Assembly Fall Veto Session is scheduled for November 13-15 and November 27~29.

Federal

0 Congress returned from the week-long Independence Day recess and has plunged into an intense July work
period. Congress immediately began to scrutinize the US. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)
Office of Refugee Resettlement?s (ORR) efforts to care for children separated from their parents at the border as
a federal judge in California ordered the agency to reunify them. By the middle ofJuly reports had surfaced of
HHS diverting funds from other health programs to ORR in order to cover the costs of dealing with the crisis.

a The constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has emerged, along with reproductive rights, as key points
of contention in the battle to confirm DC. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Brett Kavanaugh to replace US.
Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, who announced his retirement at the end of June.

0 Efforts to chip away at the ACA continued in July.

0 Risk Adjustment Payments On July 7, 2018 the HHS Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
(CMS) announced that it would freeze ACA risk adjustment payments. The payments were designed to
protect insurers from major losses. Health plans pay into a pool from which CMS transfers funds to
insurers that had many high cost patients. In response, some ACA health plans may reconsider their
premium rates for the next plan year or even withdraw from certain markets. The risk adjustment
program is one of three programs in the ACA designed to help protect insurers from big losses in the
marketplaces. Risk corridors and reinsurance expired after three years, while risk adjustment was
intended to be permanent.

Navigators - On July 10, 2018 CMS announced that it would cut funding for ACA Navigators, non-profit
organizations that help people enroll in health insurance, including ACA marketplace plans, Medicaid

and CHIP. Funding will be $10 million, down from $37 million last year. The program had been funded at
$67 million the year before.

Page 41 of 58

0 Taxes On July 12, 2018 the House Ways and Means Committee advanced a bill which would delay a
pair of ACA taxes. H.R. 4616, which passed on a party?line vote, would delay the excise tax on expensive
health plans, the so-called ?Cadillac tax,? until 2023. it would also place a moratorium on
implementation of the ACA employer mandate, which would impose a tax penalty on companies with
over 50 employees who do not offer their workers affordable health insurance. The excise tax was
intended to help slow the growth of health care costs, but has been delayed several times, on a bi-
partisan basis.

I On July 11, 2018 the House Appropriations Committee approved its version of the FY 2019 Labor-HHS-Education
appropriations bill. Over the course of the markup, committee Republicans rebuffed amendments offered by
Democrats which would have approved funding for gun violence research at the National Institutes of Health
and reinstated funding for Title family planning grants and Planned Parenthood. The Senate committee
cleared its version of the bill right before the Independence Day recess without any of these contentious policy
riders, which will complicate the effort to reconcile the two measures. It is not clear when either chamber will
take up their Labor-HHS bills on the floor.

0 Congress continued to discuss the 34GB drug discount program, with a legislative hearing on July 11, 2018
before the Health Subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The committee heard from
the director of the health ca re team at the Government Accountability Office (GAO) as well as three health ca re
executives, including the CEO of Parkland Hospital in Dallas, the Pharmacist-in-Chief and Associate Dean at UC
San Diego and the EVP at Texas Oncology. The question and answer period with the panel gave
lawmakers the opportunity to air familiar concerns about the focus of the 340B program and whether hospitals
are using it appropriately to support their safety net mission. One proposal of note, by Rep. Joe Barton (R-
Texas), would raise the minimum disproportionate share adjustment percentage required to participate in 3408
from 11.75% to 18%.

On July 17, 2018 a federal appeals court ruled that hospital groups, including America?s Essential Hospitals, lack
standing to challenge planned cuts to the 3408 program, as the district court had ruled in December. This clears
the way for HHS to proceed with a Medicare rule which cuts payments to providers for certain drugs under the
3408 program by nearly 30 percent.

0 On July 19, 2018 the Pandemic and All?Hazards Preparedness and Advancing innovation Act (H.R. 6378) passed the
House Energy Commerce Committee by voice vote. H.R. 6378 will reauthorize key preparedness and response
programs within the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act (PAHPA) for five years. The bill reauthorizes the
Public Health Emergency Preparedness Program (PHEP) and a revamped Hospital Preparedness Program (HPP). The
bill will also provide resources for the development of medical countermeasures for pandemic influenza and
emerging infectious diseases within Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA).

Protection of Medicaid remains a key priority for at both the State and Federal level.
