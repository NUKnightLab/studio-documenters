perform any function pertaining to its government and affairs; and
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED AS FOLLOWS:
The foregoing recitals are incorporated herein as findings of the Board of Commissioners of
Cook County, Illinois.
a. The Property Defined. The Lake Parcel and the Crawford Parcel are hereinafter

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 4, 2009
d. Joint Planning Effort. The Board hereby recognizes that the history of the Property’s
use by the County and the history embodied on the site require careful consideration and
planning of future uses, and should be appropriately preserved and commemorated in a
manner conducive to education of the public, and that such planning and preservation is the
responsibility of both Cook County and of the District. The Board further recognizes that
access to and uses of the Property require ongoing planning and cooperation and will impact

hereby authorizes the President and his designees to engage in a joint planning effort
incorporating historic preservation, investigations, environmental restoration, and planning
for the District’s proposed use of the Property and the impacts of such use on the Oak Forest
Hospital Campus. Further, the Board hereby directs the Comptroller to set aside from the

Submitting a Proposed Ordinance sponsored by
EARLEAN COLLINS, County Commissioner
PROPOSED ORDINANCE
LOITERING
BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that Chapter 58 Offenses and
Miscellaneous Provisions, Section 171 of the Cook County Code is hereby enacted as follows:
Sec. 171.

Loitering.

(A)
No person shall intentionally obstruct or interfere with the free passage of persons, or use
language, conversation or conduct to otherwise disrupt the reasonable peace and enjoyment of bystanders
in the vicinity. Acts authorized as an exercise of one’s constitutional right to picket or to legally protest
shall not constitute obstruction of pedestrian or vehicular flow.
(B)
No person shall loiter in public areas at a time or in a manner that warrants reasonable
alarm for the safety of persons or property. Among the circumstances which may be considered in
determining whether such alarm is warranted is the fact that the actor takes flight upon the appearance of
a peace officer, refuses to identify himself or herself, or manifestly endeavors to conceal himself or
herself or any object. Unless flight by the actor or other circumstances make it impracticable, a peace
officer shall, prior to any arrest for an offense under this section, afford the actor an opportunity to dispel
any alarm which would otherwise be warranted by requesting him or her to identify himself or herself and
explain his or her presence and conduct. No person shall be convicted of an offense under this section if
the peace officer did not comply with the preceding sentence, or if it appears at trial that the explanation
given by the actor was true and, if believed by the peace officer at the time, would have dispelled the
alarm.

3240

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 4, 2009

(C)

than $100 for all subsequent offenses, or ordered to perform community service, or both. For children
under twelve years of age who violate this Ordinance, their parent or custodian shall receive a warning for
the first offense, be fined not less than $25 for a second offense, $50 for a third offense, and no more than
$100 for all subsequent offenses, or ordered to perform community service, or both.

WHEREAS, in response to an increasingly complex world, with rapid advancements in the field of
communications, energy production, and transmission, the members of the Eighty-Third Illinois General
Assembly passed the Citizens Utility Board Act; and
WHEREAS, this landmark legislation creating the Citizens Utility Board (CUB) established a model for
the country, as an effective response to return the balance of power between consumers and industry in a
deregulated operating environment for utilities throughout the nation; and
WHEREAS, since its inception, CUB has saved consumers over $10 billion by blocking unnecessary
rate hikes, negotiating refunds, monitoring utility operations, and serving as a watchdog to ensure
compliance with all applicable laws and regulations; and
WHEREAS, CUB has earned its reputation for a taking a tough but fair-minded approach to seeking
compromise solutions to complex regulatory issues, allowing utilities to earn a reasonable return on
capital investments while limiting their ability to undermine the public interest by profiting excessively at
the expense of the ratepayer; and
WHEREAS, for twenty-five years, CUB has been a tireless advocate for consumers of energy and
communications services, and has been a highly effective voice on behalf of the people of Illinois in the
legislative and policy arenas; and
WHEREAS, with over 200,000 active and engaged citizens participating in CUB’s vaunted e-action
network, the organization is poised to continue increasing its influence well into the next quarter-century
and beyond.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Board of Commissioners of Cook County that the
Board does hereby offer its congratulations to the Citizens Utility Board as it celebrates its 25th
Anniversary of fighting for Illinois consumers; and

302621

JUVENILE TEMPORARY DETENTION CENTER, by Earl L. Dunlap, Transitional
Administrator, transmitting a Communication, dated August 21, 2009:
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to increase by $5,042,594.85
$4,500,000.00 and extend for thirteen (13) ten (10) months, Contract No. 08-41-321 with
THE WACKENHUT CORPORATION, Westchester, Illinois, for security services including:
night watch, escorted movement and control services, direct residential supervision,
emergency staffing, and timekeeping monitor functions on a 24 hours per day, 7 days per
week basis.
Board approved amount 05-20-08:

$1,862,848.00
1,550,000.00
4,500,000.00
$7,912,848.00

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 4, 2009
Reason:

Pursuant to Clause 5(f) of the agreed order appointing a Transitional
Administrator, 99 C 3945 Doe v. Cook County, the Office of the Transitional
Administrator, in its authority as established in the Court Order entered on
August 14, 2007, has selected The Wackenhut Corporation to provide security
services to ensure the safety and security of the Juvenile Temporary Detention
Center (JTDC) residents and staff members while the JTDC continues to
implement its hiring plan. The JTDC continues to experience unexpected
terminations, resignations, transfers and new eligibility requirements, causing
fluctuations in the needs for the JTDC staff coverage. The expiration date of the
current contract was May 31, 2009. The contract was extended on June 16, 2009
for the period beginning June 1, 2009 through August 31, 2009; however, the
contract was not extended due to a delay on the part of the vendor. We are
projecting the need for continued services provided by the Wackenhut
Corporation through June 30, 2010.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $5,042,594.85 (FY 2009: $542,594.85; and FY 2010:
$4,500,000.00). Contract extension: June September 1, 2009 through June 30, 2010. (569260 Account).
Approval of this item would commit Fiscal Year 2010 funds.
* Referred to the Committee on Finance on 09/16/09.
** No action was taken at the Finance Committee meeting of 10/06/09.
COMMISSIONER BEAVERS, SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER MURPHY, MOVED TO

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 4, 2009
Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Committee on Information Technology & Automation of the Board of Commissioners of Cook
County met pursuant to notice on Monday, November 2, 2009 at the hour of 9:30 A.M. in the Board
Room, Room 569, County Building, 118 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois.
Your Committee has considered the following items and, upon adoption of this report, the
recommendations are as follows:
303125

BUREAU OF TECHNOLOGY, by Antonio Hylton, Chief Information Officer, transmitting
a Communication, dated October 14, 2009:
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with
ELECTRONIC KNOWLEDGE INTERCHANGE, INC., Chicago, Illinois, for
professional services in support of the Cook County Program Management Initiative.
Reason:

The Bureau of Technology has undertaken a series of studies designed to
maximize operating efficiencies and insure long term strategic value regarding
the County's investment in technology. This study will analyze current
technology operations at a countywide level, identify gaps within the multiple
technology silos and develop an Enterprise Architectural model to effectively
maximize future capital investments and reduce future operating costs.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $1,110,000.00. Contract period: November 1, 2009 through
October 31, 2010. (009-260 Account). Requisition No. 90090030.
*Referred to the Committee on Information Technology & Automation on 10-20-09.
Commissioner Goslin inquired whether Mr. Hylton has a consolidation proposal which could lead to
efficiencies on behalf of which the Commissioners could advocate.
Mr. Hylton replied that the Enterprise Architectural model under consideration – which most large
counties have – is a road map that can lead to efficiencies. He further stated that it is his recommendation
that all the major IT consulting firms be hired in connection with this Item to ensure independence and
transparency.
Commissioner Peraica inquired as to the timeline for this plan.
Mr. Hylton replied that the plan would be ready by Spring, depending upon what consolidation
recommendations the Enterprise Architectural model yields.
Commissioner Peraica inquired as to how long this company has been in existence.
Mr. Hylton replied ten years; he further stated that this company has met all of the compliance
requirements posed by the Purchasing Department.
In response to Commissioner Peraica’s request, Mr. Hylton agreed to forward a copy of the Electronic
Knowledge Interchange, Inc.’s RFP response to Chairman Beavers.
Commissioner Peraica inquired whether this study will examine internal enhancements and
improvements, consolidation, external outsourcing and privatizing of particular functions.

3299

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 4, 2009
Mr. Hylton replied yes, and added that any ROI and justification for what the final plan is will also be
examined.
Commissioner Peraica inquired as to the target date for the completion of this study.
Mr. Hylton replied one year.
Commissioner Peraica inquired whether the company recommending this plan will also be involved in the
implementation of this plan.
Mr. Hylton replied it is not the intention at this time that the company be involved in the implementation
of the plan; however, common practices do not preclude them from being so involved.
Commissioner Peraica inquired whether this company is an IT practitioner as well as a consulting firm.
Mr. Hylton replied in the affirmative.
Commissioner Schneider stated that it was his understanding that this study would move the County IT
operation toward consolidation.
Mr. Hylton confirmed this, stating further that the directions which this study would yield would then be
brought before the Board to be adopted.
Commissioner Schneider inquired whether it is possible to access any of the elected officials’ special
purpose funds to fund this study.
Mr. Hylton stated that would be studied. He further stated that during his budget hearing, he will outline
several such options.
Commissioner Steele, seconded by Commissioner Goslin, moved the approval of Communication
No. 303125. The motion carried unanimously.
Commissioner Steele moved to adjourn the meeting, seconded by Commissioner Goslin.

perform any function pertaining to its government and affairs; and

3301

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 4, 2009
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED AS FOLLOWS:
The foregoing recitals are incorporated herein as findings of the Board of Commissioners of
Cook County, Illinois.
a. The Property Defined. The Lake Parcel and the Crawford Parcel are hereinafter
referred to collectively as the “Property”. The property on which the Oak Forest Hospital of
Cook County and other County-owned facilities are located, immediately west of the Lake
Parcel, is referred to herein as the “Oak Forest Hospital Campus”.
b. Conveyance Authorized. The Board hereby determines that the conveyance of the Lake
Parcel and the Crawford Parcel to the District is in the public interest. The Board hereby
authorizes the conveyance of the Property to the District by quit claim deed, in consideration
of a total purchase price of $15,050,000.00 (the “Purchase Price”), for the public purposes of
preserving the existing burial areas in an appropriate manner and as required by applicable
laws, protecting and preserving historic sites, and protecting and preserving the flora, fauna
and scenic beauties, in accordance with the District’s authority. It is hereby acknowledged
that the County has already received $13,261,066.00 from the District pursuant to District
Resolution No. 07-R-02-07-05, which funds shall be applied to the Purchase Price. Such
conveyance shall be subject to restrictions, covenants and easements shown of record,
easements for an existing pipeline, water line, sanitary and storm sewer lines, and an
easement for continued access by an existing roadway, and shall be “as is”, without
warranties of any sort.
c. Execution of Documents. The Board hereby authorizes the President of the Board to
execute, and the Cook County Clerk to attest to, a quit claim deed or deeds to effectuate the
conveyance described in this Resolution. The Board further authorizes the President or his
designee to execute any and all documents and take all actions necessary to effectuate the
conveyances described herein and receive the balance of the Purchase Price, in a timely
manner and in accordance with customary terms and conditions, subject to this Resolution; to
execute, deliver and record proper conveyances or agreements regarding the easements; and
to provide for the payment of closing costs customarily borne by sellers out of the proceeds at
closing.
d. Joint Planning Effort. The Board hereby recognizes that the history of the Property’s
use by the County and the history embodied on the site require careful consideration and
planning of future uses, and should be appropriately preserved and commemorated in a
manner conducive to education of the public, and that such planning and preservation is the
responsibility of both Cook County and of the District. The Board further recognizes that
access to and uses of the Property require ongoing planning and cooperation and will impact
the County, Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County, and the District. Therefore, the Board
hereby authorizes the President and his designees to engage in a joint planning effort
incorporating historic preservation, investigations, environmental restoration, and planning
for the District’s proposed use of the Property and the impacts of such use on the Oak Forest
Hospital Campus. Further, the Board hereby directs the Comptroller to set aside from the
proceeds of closing $150,000.00 to be utilized to pay one-half the cost of such efforts,
including the retention of consultants, planners and other experts, it being understood that the
District will likewise pay one-half the cost.
*Referred to the Real Estate & Business & Economic Development Subcommittee on
10/06/09.

OFFICE OF ADOPTION AND CHILD CUSTODY ADVOCACY
TRANSFER OF FUNDS
Transmitting a Communication, dated October 20, 2009 from
ANGELA M. BAILEY, Director, Office of Adoption and Child Custody Advocacy
requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners to transfer funds totaling $1,645.00 from and to the
accounts listed below, for continued field administrative operations as court ordered.

3303

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 4, 2009
Reason:

The Office of Adoption and Child Custody Advocacy has seen an increase in court orders to
conduct home investigations that extends throughout the entire county. As a result, the
mileage reimbursement fund has been depleted. This transfer will allow for field operations
to continue as court ordered.

From Accounts:

451-388
451-440

$1,645.00

Total

$1,645.00
$1,645.00

To Account:
451-190

1.

Transportation and Other Travel Services

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
It became apparent on October 20, 2009 that the receiving account had been depleted and would not
meet its current obligation. The balance on the account is $-344.00 and thirty days prior the account
balance was $832.12.

2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
Accounts 451-186, 451-388 and 451-440 were identified as the source of transfer because of an
unanticipated surplus in the accounts. There were no other accounts considered.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from 451-186, 451-388 and 451-440.
None.

4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
Account 451-186 has a surplus because the office anticipated hiring new staff. Due to budget
restrictions, new staff was not hired.
Account 451-440 has a surplus because during the FY 2009 there were no necessary maintenance
or repairs needed for office equipment.
Account 451-388 has a surplus because the computer operation supplies has already been purchased
for the remainder of FY 2009.

Commissioner Daley, seconded by Commissioner Suffredin, moved that the transfer of funds be

REDEVELOPMENT OF THE HISTORIC COOK COUNTY HOSPITAL MAIN BUILDING
Transmitting a Communication, dated October 21, 2009 from
BRUCE WASHINGTON, Director, Office of Capital Planning and Policy
The Office of Capital Planning and Policy is requesting authorization to proceed with the redevelopment
of the historic Cook County Hospital Main Building for administrative offices for the Cook County
Health & Hospitals System.
On May 5, 2009 the Board of Commissioners approved a contract with Jones Lang LaSalle Americas,
Inc. (JLL) to perform preliminary analysis and planning for the adaptive reuse of the historic Cook
County Hospital Main Building. JLL analyzed the market and financial feasibility of office, hotel,
dormitory, rental housing, condominium housing, senior housing and educational uses, and concluded
that the most affordable and lowest risk reuse option is to renovate the building for administrative office
use by the Cook County Health & Hospitals System to replace 1900 West Polk, which is scheduled for
demolition.

3310

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 4, 2009
The estimated cost of renovation for office use is $107,700,000.00. The Office of Capital Planning and
Policy will seek Tax Increment Financing (TIF) funds from the City of Chicago to assist with the costs of
renovation. Due to the building's status as "threatened" on the Landmarks Illinois Watch List, we
anticipate that substantial funds should be available.
The Office of Capital Planning and Policy requests permission to present the Cook County Hospital
Adaptive Reuse Study prepared by JLL to the Board of Commissioners.

JUDICIARY
CONTRACT
Transmitting a Communication, dated September 29, 2009 from
TIMOTHY C. EVANS, Chief Judge, Circuit Court of Cook County
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a no-cost contract with Northwestern
University Center for Public Safety, Evanston, Illinois, to administer the operations of the Circuit Court
of Cook County’s Traffic Safety Program. Under this proposed contract, Northwestern University Center
for Public Safety will conduct traffic safety school instruction through classroom sessions held throughout
Cook County and through the internet for a five (5) year period beginning November 1, 2009.
Reason:

On April 28, 2009, the County issued a Request for Proposal (RFP) for an independent,
qualified organization to manage the Circuit Court of Cook County’s Traffic Safety Program.
This program was established by the court in the 1980s, pursuant to Supreme Court Rule
529(c) and is managed in accordance with the Traffic Safety Program Standards, adopted by
the Conference of Chief Circuit Judges. Two (2) prospective vendors submitted written
proposals in response to the RFP, both of which were qualified under the Program Standards
Section 3.05, item 4, as independent not-for-profit organizations. The Northwestern
University Center for Public Safety proposed significantly lower course fees for most
components of the program.

3328

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 4, 2009
At current course volumes, the Northwestern University Center for Public Safety proposal
would save program participants approximately $5 million over the five (5) year period as
compared to the second proposal and $10 million as compared to the current program
configuration. For the first time ever, program participants will see a substantial decrease in
course fees, offering defendants additional encouragement to take advantage of the court
diversion alternative. Further, the fees proposed by Northwestern University Center for
Public Safety are generally lower than those now offered in other Illinois jurisdictions.
Based primarily upon their substantially lower proposed fees, their experience and
unblemished record of service with the court, and the avoidance of transition costs and
business interruption risks that would otherwise be present with a change to another vendor,
the court recommends Northwestern University Center for Public Safety for the new contract.
The Traffic Safety Program contract will not have a fiscal impact on Cook County. The costs
of the program are funded entirely by fees paid by defendants charged with traffic violations
in Cook County who receive Traffic Safety Program instruction as a sentencing option.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: None. Contract period: November 1, 2009 through October 31, 2014.

Commissioner Collins, seconded by Commissioner Murphy, moved that the County Purchasing Agent be
authorized to enter into the requested contract. The motion carried unanimously.

requesting authorization to allocate and expend funds awarded to Cook County under a U.S. Department
of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) grant for the purposes of the Neighborhood Stabilization
Program (NSP), authorized under Title III of the Housing Economic Recovery Act 2008 (HERA). The
purpose of the Neighborhood Stabilization Program is to assist communities that have been or are likely
to be affected by foreclosed and/or abandoned properties. The Program will provide affordable rental and
home ownership opportunities to eligible income households. Cook County has been awarded
$28,156,321.00 for implementation in suburban Cook County communities with the greatest need. Cook
County utilized HUD foreclosure and abandonment data to determine priority areas that are eligible for

Commissioners on May 19, 2009.
The Department has subsequently received various applications and requests for such funds from the
community and has made recommendations for the allocation and expenditure of the same.
I respectfully request approval to allocate and expend funds from this grant award and that the President
of the Cook County Board of Commissioners, the Chief of the Bureau of Capital, Planning and Facilities
Management, or his designee, is authorized to execute on behalf of the County of Cook, any and all
documents necessary to facilitate administration of the Program approved herein, including but not
limited to the NSP grant agreement and any modifications thereto. The approval of this award for
administration of the Program by this Honorable Body will permit the Neighborhood Stabilization
Program to move forward.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: None. Grant Award: $24,039,689.00.

REAL ESTATE MANAGEMENT DIVISION
PERMISSION TO NEGOTIATE
Transmitting a Communication, dated October 21, 2009 from
RAYMOND MULDOON, Director, Real Estate Management Division
This is a request to enter into negotiations for the possible purchase of property available or becoming
available in the area of the 4th Municipal District Courthouse located in Maywood, Illinois and to retain
Cushman & Wakefield/Frontier Commercial to represent the County in such negotiations. The 4th
Municipal District Courthouse has longstanding problems with traffic circulation and parking. It has
come to our attention that certain privately-owned property in the courthouse area may be available for
purchase. Acquisition of this property would allow for the construction of additional parking facilities.
Cushman & Wakefiled/Frontier Commercial was selected pursuant to a Request for Qualification (RFQ)
process and is well-qualified to represent the County in purchase negotiations. The fee for such
representation will be paid by the seller upon closing of a purchase, if the Board of Commissioners
approves a recommended transaction.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: None. Contract period: December 1, 2009 through November 30, 2010.

OFFICE OF THE RECORDER OF DEEDS
PROPOSED CONTRACT
Transmitting a Communication, dated September 30, 2009 from
EUGENE "GENE" MOORE, Cook County Recorder of Deeds
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with Fidlar Technologies, Inc.,
Rock Island, Illinois, for the property Fraud Alert system, the Disaster Recovery System and the
Tapestry/Laredo Data Sales program. The Property Fraud Alert system will serve as an early notification
for Cook County property owners, allowing them to intervene in the event of fraudulent transactions. The
Disaster Recovery System will allow the office to resume operating within hours of any interruption of
service, whether natural or otherwise. The Tapestry/Laredo Data Sales program is expected to increase
revenue from the sale of Recorder of Deeds information beyond the current levels.
Reason:

Fidlar Technologies, Inc. provides the industry's only proactive land fraud notification system
that functions in harmony with third party recording systems. The system requires no
additional modifications to existing Recorder of Deeds operation. The Fidlar Disaster
Recovery system feeds the Tapestry/Laredo Data Sales program with recorded information,
which provides an additional level of network security for the Recorder of Deeds office.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $322,000.00 (FY 2009: $131,613.00; and FY 2010: $190,387.00). Contract
period: November 1, 2009 through October 31, 2010. (527-260 Account). Requisition No. 95270035.
Sufficient funds are available in the Recorder of Deeds Document Storage Fund.
The Purchasing Agent concurs.
Vendor has met the Minority and Women Business Enterprise Ordinance.

by
ZAHRA ALI, Deputy Director, Cook County Department of Revenue.
requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners to transfer funds totaling $21,179.00 from and to the
accounts listed below, for increasing and processing revenue collection enhancement efforts.
Reason:

increase and process revenue collection enhancement efforts.

From Accounts:
007-240

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
On October 9, 2009 it became apparent that account 007-225 (Postage) would require additional
funds in order to meet the revenue mailing volume. The balance in account 007-225 thirty days
prior was $13,994.

3340

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 4, 2009
On October 9, 2009 it became apparent that account 007-388 (Computer Operation Supplies) would
require additional funds in order to obtain software applications and computer supplies required to
support the department's revenue generating efforts. The balance in account 007-388 thirty days
prior was $5,355.
2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
Accounts 007-240, 007-268, 007-355 and 007-630 were identified as the source of transferred
funds because of unanticipated surpluses in these accounts.
There were no other accounts considered.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from accounts 007-240, 007-268, 007-355 and 007-630.
None. There will be no other projects or purchases affected as a result of these transfers.

4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
Accounts 007-240 and 007-355 have surpluses because this office was efficiently monitoring these
expenses throughout the year. Account 007-268 had a surplus because the department no longer
has a need for court reporting services, that responsibility was moved to the Department of
Administrative Hearings. Account 007-630 had a surplus because the department anticipated
replacing some office equipment, however, to conserve funds the department decided not to make
any new purchases this fiscal year.

Commissioner Daley, seconded by Commissioner Suffredin, moved that the transfer of funds be
approved. The motion carried unanimously.

specialist from our Victim Witness Assistance Program, one (1) court advocate from Hull House and one

provided through the TAC Program provide a better opportunity for victims to break the cycle of violence
while ensuring victim cooperation, victim safety and offender accountability.
This grant does not require a match contribution.

MICHELE V. LATZ, Chief of the Administrative Services Bureau, State’s Attorney’s Office
requesting authorization to renew a grant in the amount of $271,238.00 from the Illinois Criminal Justice
Information Authority. This grant provides funding for the DNA Training and Prosecution Program. The
DNA Training and Prosecution Program provides training, support and assistance to assistant state’s
attorneys in cases involving DNA evidence. The program works to best utilize limited DNA testing
resources by being an internal resource for other bureaus of the office for the purpose of teaching and
consulting on how to make better use of DNA evidence and expedite cases. In addition, the program
helps to prepare all assistant state’s attorneys for the continued growth and importance that DNA
technology has to law enforcement. In addition, the program investigates and prosecutes some complex
cases that involve DNA evidence. The DNA Training and Prosecution Program dedicates one assistant
state’s attorney, one DNA Resource Specialist, and one investigator to the Criminal Prosecutions Bureau
of the State’s Attorney’s Office. This grant requires that our office match one dollar for every three
dollars of federal funding. A cash match from the Capital Litigation Fund that partially supports the
