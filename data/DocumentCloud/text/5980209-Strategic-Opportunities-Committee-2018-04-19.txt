Strategic Opportunities and Coordinating Council Advisory Committee Members

Re:

April 19 Joint Strategic Opportunities and Coordinating Council Advisory Committee

Because a large focus of our strategic direction is currently the work at the local level of the county
coordinating Councils and Redeploy boards, we are combining our Strategic Opportunities (SOC) and
Coordinating Council Advisory Committee (CCAC) meetings this quarter. The meeting will be held on
Thursday, April 19, from 2:00-3:00 p.m. at ICJIA’s office at 300 West Adams, Chicago, Suite 200.
First, we want to give an overview of the upcoming joint conference of Adult Redeploy and Criminal
Justice Coordinating Councils entitled “Data, Planning, and Impact: A Joint Adult Redeploy Illinois
and Criminal Justice Coordinating Councils Summit.” Hosted by ICJIA, Adult Redeploy Illinois, and
Loyola University’s Center for Criminal Justice Research, Policy, and Practice, the Summit will bring
together a broad range of stakeholders from counties and judicial circuits either operating or interested in
developing CJCCs and ARI-funded local prison diversion programs. By combining CJCC and ARI
programing in a single summit, we hope to provide rich opportunities for mutual learning and foster
discussions about coordinated decision-making. We ask for your input on strategies to make the most of
this convening. An agenda for the summit is attached.
Next, we want to discuss what steps ICJIA should take to follow up on the summit. One challenge is to
sustainably expand our outreach to new counties to provide technical assistance to criminal justice
coordinating councils and other collaborative groups. While we have committed to providing technical
assistance to our five county partners through the end of 2018, we would like to find ways to continue to
support collaborative criminal justice planning efforts in these counties and in other interested
jurisdictions, and identify ways that other collaborative groups (Family Violence Coordinating Councils,
Adult Redeploy, etc.) could benefit from these efforts as well.
We look forward to your participation and guidance.
