RE: Proposed Calendar and Related Resolutions for the 2019-2020 Budget
Development Process

Attached please ?nd the proposed budget calendar for the 2019-2020 budget development
process for your consideration, as well as the resolutions that modify the committee meeting
schedules during the budget development process.

The budget timeline begins earlier than indicated in the City?s ordinance for the ?fth consecutive
year and is shortened, originally to comport with the state legislation, PA. 181 of 2014
(Attachment VI), which amended the Home Rule City Act and states speci?cally that the
Financial Review Commission (FRC) must be given the proposed budget 100 days prior to the
beginning of the ?scal year, or March 23. However this year, due to the resolution of
2018?13 (Attachment VII), since the City has satis?ed the conditions in Section 8 of PA. 181,
the deadline for submitting an approved budget has been extended to April 30, which permits the
budget calendar to be extended to four weeks and the votes to be completed by the Council and
the Mayor by Thursday, April 18.

PA. 182 of 2014 (Attachment VI) also amended the Home Rule City Act and states that the city
must hold a revenue estimating conference in the third week of February (as well as a second one
every September) and it is scheduled for Wednesday, February 13 at 1 pm. in the 13th ?oor
Auditorium. These estimated revenues will be the basis of the proposed budget for the following
?scal year and the Administration is scheduled to present the proposed budget to Council on
Thursday, March 7. However, so Council can begin with hearings as quickly as possible, the
Budget Department had agreed to deliver 7 departmental budgets to LPD by Monday, March 4
so we can begin to produce budget analysis reports for Councilmembers to review prior to
hearings that will begin on Monday, March 11.

The departmental budget hearings in general are scheduled for one hour increments. Sessions
for an hour are suggested for departments that have many activities or have important service
delivery issues that Council may wish to explore with the department. However, based on the

I IO BUNNHI 10 WFIHHW Il?l Isl-huh In!" lam] Ii: I



issues that present themselves at budget time especially once Council sees the recommended
budget, Council always has the ?exibility and may determine at that time to either have a
speci?c hearing extended or choose not to use the entire time. There are so many hearings to get
through in such a short time frame that we tried hard to maximize Council?s time at the table.

We also recognize that other important policy issues may come up after the calendar is set, and
we will work to amend the schedule, if necessary, as we always do each year.

We would like to highlight the following issues.
1. Mayor?s Presentation of the Recommended Budget 

The Administration has requested that the budget be presented to Council on Thursday,
March 7. Typically, the Mayor presents the budget to Council via a presentation in the
Committee of the Whole.

We propose that Council hold a Committee of the Whole at 11 am, and limit the Planning
and Economic Development Standing Committee meeting from 10 am. through 11 am. If
Council agrees, Attachment I represents a resolution that would authorize the Committee of
the Whole on Thursday, March 7.

2. Changing the Standing Committee starting times 

We propose that all morning Council Standing Committees begin at 9:00 am. from Monday,
March 11 through Thursday, March 28, resuming the 10:00 am. starting time on Monday,
April 1. The Formal Session would not be altered and continue to start at 10:00 am. each
Tuesday.

The Budget Finance and Audit Standing Committee and the Neighborhood and Community
Services Standing Committee would continue to meet at the usual 1:00 pm. on Wednesdays
and Thursdays.

Attachment 11 represents a resolution authorizing the Council Standing Committees to begin
at 9:00 am. and it is combined with the resolution to limit the time of each meeting.

3. Time Limit for Council Standing Committee Meetings 
We propose that the Council Standing Committees continue to meet on the usual day, but
that the length of the meeting is contained to no more than one hour. This schedule would

begin on Monday, March ll and continue through Monday, April 8.

Attachment 11 represents a resolution authorizing this change to limit the time of the Standing
Committee Meetings.

4. City Council Public Budget Hearing on the Mayor?s Recommended Budget -

It is charter mandated, Section 8-206 that, public hearing shall be held on the proposed
budget before adoption.?

We are recommending that the public hearing be held on Monday, April 1 at 5 pm.

Attachment 111 represents a resolution setting the public hearing and directing the Clerk to
publish the hearing noti?cation within the proper timeframe.

5. Dangerous Building Hearings 

We propose that the dangerous building hearings be deferred from Monday, March 11
through Monday, April 1, in order to permit more scheduling time for Departmental Budget
Hearings. The clerk has already been requested to block those days off. Dangerous Building
Hearings would be able to resume on Monday, April 8.

No resolution is needed for this action.
6. City Council Task Force Meetings 

If there are any Council Task Force Meetings scheduled during the recommended scheduled
budget hearings and discussions we would ask if they possibly could be rescheduled.

Please let our of?ce know if any meetings need to occur during budget hearings or budget
deliberations, and if budget-related hearing times should be changed.

7. Enforcement of the Budget Hearing Schedule

Finally, Attachment IV represents a resolution outlining the budget hearing scheduling
process and institutes a process to try to limit the number of changes the departments can
make regarding budget hearings after they have had a chance to review and the schedule has
been ?nalized. We give the Administration and the agencies time for feed back and time
adjustments, so we should come out with a schedule that satis?es all involved.

8. The ?nal date for Council to vote on the budget is Monday April 8. The ?nal day for
Council to override the Mayor?s veto, if any, is Thursday, April 18. We would assist in
reminding Council at the Formal Session prior to these dates to adjourn the Formal Session
to the call of the chair, so the session can be reconvened on these irregular dates.

We would request that this entire document be referred at the Formal Session on Tuesday,
January 29, and discussed by the members of the Budget, Finance and Audit Standing
Committee on Wednesday, January 30. If approved by the committee members, the four
resolutions attached would be considered for approval by the City Council during the Formal
Session on Tuesday, February 5, to authorize the above action plan as in previous years.

We will then formally submit the ?nal draft to the Administration and the agencies. We will
give them about two weeks to make certain that all department directors will be available for the
proposed budget hearing dates and times. Any requested adjustments will be made and then a

?nal budget calendar will be formally submitted to Council and the Administration. At that
point, department directors may make a change to the dates and times only if there is an extreme
emergency. Attachment IV represents the resolution authorizing this policy.

In addition, Attachment represents the proposed budget calendar for the 2019-2020 budget
development process prepared by LPD for your consideration.

We are available to discuss or answer any questions regarding any of these dates or issues.
Additionally, if any Councilmember or Council staff have any questions about the budget
process, our staff is able to answer questions and can set up any informational meetings at any
time.

MICHIGAN FINANCIAL REVIEW COMMISSION ACT
Act1810f20l4

AN ACT to create the Michigan ?nancial review commission act; to provide for the operation of certain
commissions; to create funds and accounts: to prescribe the powers and duties of certain commissions. the
state treasurer. certain other state of?cials and state employees. and certain local oi?cials: to provide for the
dissolution of certain commissions; and to make certain appropriations.

History: 20H. Act IBI. lmd. June 20. 2014

The People ofrire State of Michigan enact:

141.1631 Short title.
See. I. This act shall be known and may be cited as the "Michigan ?nancial review commission act".
llistory: 20M, Act "it. lmd. Et?l? June 20. 

141.1532 Legislative ?ndings and declarations.

Sec. 2. The legislature ?nds and declares the following:

it is the public policy or this state to exercise its sovereign powers with regard to debt issuance and
matters ol? statewide concem in a manner calculated to foster the ?scal integrity of all municipal governments
and school districts to assure that those municipalities and school districts provide for the health. safety. and
welfare or their residents; pay principal and interest owed on debt obligations when due: meet ?nancial
obligations to their existing and former employees. vendors. and suppliers: and provide for proper ?nancial
planning procedures and budgeting practices. The inability of a municipal government to provide essential
services to its citizens or a school district to provide public education services to its residents as a result of
?scal emergencies is determined to affect adversely the health. safety. and welfare of not only that
municipality's citizens and a school district's residents. but also other citizens olthis state.

(bi The police and ?re retirement system ol? certain qualified cities and the general retirement system of
certain quali?ed cities are currently underfunded. causing communities across the state to face higher costs to
borrow and invest funds. and have caused bondholders. band insurers. and ?nancial institutions anxiety over
the ?nancial health of not only certain quali?ed cities. but communities across this state.

Absent prospective state oversiytt over quali?ed cities and school districts. there exists a threat of
increased costs in borrowing. reductions in credit or bond ratings. reduced faith from existing creditors of
municipalities or school districts and of this state. and dire ?nancial circumstances from which this state and
its political subdivisions may never fully recover.

Quali?ed cities and school districts have complex budgetary and ?scal needs. signi?cant and
complicated debt management issues. and ?nancial assets and liabilities that impact. both positively and
negatively. every unit at? local government and school district in this state and this state itself such that
reasonable and balanced state oversight over quali?ed cities and school districts is required in a reasonable
exercise ol?this state's power for the bene?t of residents throughout this state.

There are numerous residents of this state who have accrued pension bene?ts from a quali?ed city's
pension systems. and those pensioners may reside throughout this state. The settlement of bankruptcy cases
involving quali?ed cities is likely to have a substantial positive impact statewide.

it?) Establishing a commission and execution by the commission of its powers granted under this act l'ul?ll
in all respects a public and governmental purpose for the bene?t of the people of this state.

Ongoing ?scal oversight over quali?ed cities and school districts is a reasonable and suf?ciently
narrow regulation and serves a signi?cant and legitimate public purpose because it inurcs to the bene?t of all
of tltis state's residan and aids in the remedy of: broad and general social problem.

Fiscal oversight over quali?ed cities and over school districts will ensure that those quali?ed cities and
school districts do not engage in the ?nancial practices that led to ?nancial emergencies and insolvency. and
ultimately. entry into receivership and bankruptcy. which will ensure that those cities can provide basic and
essential municipal services to their residents and that those school districts can provide public education
services to their residents.
