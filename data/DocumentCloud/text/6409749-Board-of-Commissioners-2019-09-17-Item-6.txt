Recommendation

The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) recommends that the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing
Authority (CHA) authorize CHA staff to proceed with the application process for Renaissance North
Apartments under the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) Rental Assistance
Demonstration (RAD) program. The RAD conversion of Renaissance North’s 18 Public Housing units to
Project-Based Voucher (PBV) funding will allow the property to operate under a more stable funding
source and provide flexibility to the new owner to leverage private financing for property improvements.
The requested action complies in all material respects with all applicable federal, state and local laws, and
Chicago Housing Authority board policies. Staff have completed all necessary due diligence to support the
submission of this initiative.

 Background and Approach

In 2012, Congress authorized the RAD program. RAD provides an opportunity for housing authorities to
utilize either project-based voucher (PBV) or project-based rental assistance (PBRA) contracts to stabilize
funding for originally up to 60,000 units of public housing nationwide; over the years, the unit cap was
raised to 455,000 units. A primary goal of RAD is to use long-term contracts to leverage private financing
for capital improvements while preserving affordability.
Receiving a RAD portfolio award in June 2015, CHA continues to progress with transitioning more than
10,000 units to Project-Based Voucher (PBV) units under the RAD program. To date, CHA has converted
more than 5,000 units to PBV subsidy. CHA plans to submit a formal RAD application to HUD for
Renaissance North Apartments that will be included as part of the larger portfolio award CHA received.
The property is a third-party owned mixed-finance property that was recently purchased by Avanath
Capital. The property was originally financed as a Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) project, but it is
currently outside of its initial 15-year LIHTC compliance period. Avanath is now seeking to invest in the
property to modernize the building and its units, requiring no additional funds from the CHA.

Property Profile: Renaissance North
•

Renaissance North is a mixed-finance property in the Near North Side community area of Chicago
in the Old Town neighborhood. The property currently contains ground floor retail space with a
total of 59 residential units, including 18 Public Housing units; 12 LIHTC units; and 29 market rate
units.

•

The property was previously owned by North Larrabee Limited Partnership and was purchased
by Avanath Capital in March 2019.

•

Avanath is planning to invest $1.1 million in capital improvements to the property, including
$11,000 per unit specifically dedicated to interior unit renovations. The scope of work includes
but is not limited to new kitchen and bathroom upgrades to units, new flooring, and new
appliances; a more modernized security system; façade repairs and cleanup, water heater
replacement, and LED lighting upgrades. Construction is scheduled to be complete before or near
the end of the third quarter 2019.

•

The property improvements planned and underway are being financed through a conventional
third-party loan through Fannie Mae. The RAD conversion of the property’s Public Housing units
will occur without monetary contributions from the CHA.
