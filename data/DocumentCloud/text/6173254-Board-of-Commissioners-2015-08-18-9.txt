EXPLANATION

In April 2013, the Board of Commissioners approved the award of an agreement with Constellation
NewEnergy Gas Division for the supply and delivery of natural gas to various CHA residential sites and
facilities for a base period of two (2) years.

The base term ofthe contract began on April 1, 2013 and expired March 31, 2015. In February 2015, the
Board approved the first of three contractual one year extension options, which set the current
contractual expiration date on March 31, 2016.

The Natural Gas Supply and Delivery Agreement offers CHA the opportunity to purchase its natural gas
needs at wholesale instead of retail, and enables the CHA to hedge against potential market price
fluctuations through use of multi-tiered price/risk management options.

The CHA is planning to utilize this contractual capability and current low pricing in the energy market to
lock in favorable natural gas commodity and interstate pipeline delivery rates for two (2) one year periods
in an effort to decrease our exposure to market volatility.

Market indicators suggest that the current natural gas commodity rates are expected to increase in the
next two years. Therefore, it is in the best interest of the CHA to present to the Board a request for
authorization to exercise both ofthe two remaining options spanning two (2) one year periods before the
current first year extension option of the contact has expired. This will enable the CHA to more flexibly
lock in current rates for future usage, for up to two years from the expiration date of the first option
period, instead of waiting for the expiration of the current term and only exercising a one year extension
option at that time.

Under this contract, Constellation provides the supply and interstate delivery of wholesale natural gas to
the Chicago central utility gate. Peoples Gas then delivers this natural gas to all CHA family, senior and
scattered site properties in the CHA traditional public housing portfolio, as well as four locations in the
mixed income portfolio. The CHA continues to utilize Peoples Gas for the distribution of natural gas from
Chicago?s central delivery gate to actual CHA buildings. The associated local distribution costs are not
included within the scope or budget of this contract and will continue to be billed separately.

The CHA is recommending that the Board authorize the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to execute
an amendment to Contract #11228 with Constellation Energy Services, Inc., to exercise both the second
and third extension options reserved under the contract, extending the contract from April 1, 2016
through March 31, 2018. This amendment will also increase the existing not to exceed compensation
funding by an amount not to exceed 5 8,168,449.

WHEREAS,

RESOLUTION NO. 2015-CHA-68

the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the
memorandum dated August 12, 2015 - entitled TO EXERCISE TWO
ONE-YEAR EXTENSION OPTIONS WITH CONSTELLATION NEWENERGY - GAS DIVISION

SITES AND 

THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY

THAT,

thecha

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to
execute a contract amendment exercising both the second and third options reserved
under Contract #11228 with Constellation NewEnergy Gas Division for the period from
April 1, 2016 through March 31, 2018, to purchase natural gas supply and delivery
services and to increase the existing not to exceed compensation amount under
Contract #11228 by an amount not to exceed 5 8,168,449, resulting in a new aggregate
compensation in an amount not to exceed 26,465,189.
