 GENERAL BACKGROUND
As part of the Capital Improvement Program, the Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) solicited
bids to perform demolition work at LeClaire Courts (RH-02). LeClaire Courts extends along the
west side of South Cicero Avenue from 44th Street to 45th Street. The structures to be demolished
no longer serve a useful purpose and their demolition is needed as part of the ongoing renovation
of CHA developments under the Plan for Transformation. The demolition work at LeClaire
Courts was split into several bid packages to provide greater contracting opportunities for
vendors. Demolition, site work and landscaping is to be completed within ninety (90) calendar
days of the date set forth in the Notice to Proceed.
PROCUREMENT HISTORY
The CHA advertised Invitation for Bid (IFB) No. 10 – 00596 on September 7, 2010 for the
demolition of dwelling units at LeClaire Courts – Group 9. The IFB was advertised in the
Chicago Sun-Times, the Chicago Defender, El Dia, the CHA website and BuySpeed Online. The
pre-bid meeting and site visit were held on September 13, 2010. The CHA received and opened
five (5) bids on September 27, 2010.
After reviewing the bid submittal materials, the Department of Procurement and Contracts and
the Capital Construction Department held a pre-award survey meeting with the apparent low
bidder, with a bid of $313,683.00, and the apparent second lowest bidder, Omega Demolition,
Corp. Both firms responded to questions on the thoroughness of their bids and their capacity to
perform this work. After further consideration, the apparent low bidder chose to rescind its bid.
Upon completion of the reviews and analysis, the Department of Procurement and Contracts has
determined that Omega Demolition, Corp. is the lowest responsive and responsible bidder for
Group 9 with a bid of $328,690.00.
Based on the foregoing, it is in the CHA’s best interest for the Board of Commissioners to
authorize the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to execute a contract with Omega
Demolition, Corp. for demolition services at LeClaire Courts – Group 9 for a firm fixed price of
$328,690.00. The demolition work and associated site work and landscaping is to be completed
within ninety (90) calendar days of the date set forth in the Notice to Proceed.
This award is subject to the Contractor’s compliance with the CHA’s MBE/WBE/DBE, Section
3 resident hiring, and bonding and insurance requirements.
