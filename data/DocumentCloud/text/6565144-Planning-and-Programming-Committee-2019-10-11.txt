Project Planning Reviews (PPRs) / Intergovernmental Review and Consultation (IGRC);
1st Quarter State Fiscal Year 2020
Mr. Ed May provided background on PPR and presented information on the following projects:
•

CUY – 43-1.98 (Widening Aurora Road from Solar Shopping Center Drive to Liberty
Road) – This project involves the following roadway improvements: pavement
resurfacing, minor widening, new traffic signal at Portz Parkway, 10’ multi-use path on
the south side, bike lane westbound (5’ sidewalk) on the north side, new water line
and storm sewer. The total cost of this project is $8.1 million. No NOACA funds will
be used.

•

Bridge painting on IR-480 and SR-10 (Lorain Road) in Cleveland and Fairview Park –
This project involves painting the structural steel of the bridges. The total cost of this
project is $34.5 million. No NOACA funds will be used.

•

Laketran Bus Replacement – Laketran is planning to purchase a new 35-foot zero
emissions battery electric transit bus which costs $783,500. Funds for the bus will
come from the Diesel Emissions Reduction Grant (DERG) program and Laketran. No
NOACA funds will be used.

Mr. May reviewed project comments from NOACA staff and the advisory councils. He noted that
with Board approval, the sponsors will be notified that their projects have completed PPR and will
be incorporated into NOACA’s long-range transportation plan and SFY 2018–2021 TIP.
A motion was made by Mr. Higgins to recommend the PPRs to the Executive Committee. The
motion was seconded by Mayor Michael Dylan Brennan. The motion passed by voice vote.
Plan and TIP Amendment; 1st Quarter SFY 2020
Mr. May stated that the following projects need to be amended to the Plan and TIP:
•

CUY SR 43 (Aurora Road) from the Solar Shopping Center, 0.13 mile east of SR-91 (SOM
Center Road) to Liberty Road in Solon - the project sponsor is Solon

•

CUY IR 480 over the Rocky River and SR 10 (Lorain Road) over the Rocky River in
Cleveland and Fairview Park - the project sponsor is ODOT

•

Laketran Bus Replacement – the project sponsor is Laketran

Mr. May stated that the total cost of the proposed projects to be amended to the Plan and TIP is
$43.4 million. The projects will receive funding from the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)
or the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) and will be administered through ODOT.
A motion was made by Councilman Griffin to recommend the Plan and TIP amendments to the
Executive Committee. The motion was seconded by Mayor Brennan. The motion passed by
voice vote.

 SFY 2021 – 2024 TIP Projects Recommended for NOACA Funding
Ms. Gallucci mentioned that a preliminary list of projects was sent out to PPC last week and since
that time, staff has received a lot of comments and questions about the equity of funding.
Ms. Gallucci advised members that they did not have to approve the SFY 2021-2024 TIP at this
meeting if they needed more time to review the information. She provided background on the TIP
development process and staff distributed a list of projects for members to review.
Mr. Randy Lane stated that the SFY 2021-2024 TIP is a compilation of projects to be implemented
using federal-aid funding over the next four years. He noted that the TIP contains road, bridge,
public transit and other transportation projects supported by federal funds through NOACA, ODOT
and transit agencies.
Mr. Lane stated that the universe of projects are evaluated for NOACA administered funding and
is developed through a comprehensive needs assessment process. He noted that nearly 700
projects totaling more than $1 billion in needs were identified for the next four years.
Ms. Gallucci mentioned that the state gas tax increase does not affect NOACA’s appropriation of
funding. She noted that NOACA receives federal gas tax which has not be increased since 1993.
Mr. Lane reviewed the following:
•
•
•
•
•
•

NOACA’s approved methodology for project recommendations
Project evaluation approach
Project recommendations (urban and rural areas)
NOACA funding by general project type (total of $119 million)
Impact of the recommended projects
Draft NOACA STBG and TAP programs budget summary (nearly $170 million total
existing and new commitments)

Ms. Gallucci mentioned that NOACA staff also applies geographical equity as part of its evaluation
process by looking at each county separately and evaluating all the projects together.
Ms. Gallucci mentioned that NOACA added 10% to the $119 million and ODOT is comfortable
with NOACA overprogramming funds.
Mr. Lane mentioned there has been a savings of 15-20% with NOACA’s STBG funds so projects
have been moved up the list.
Ms. Gallucci stated that federal funding is designated specifically for NOACA based on the
percentage of urbanized population by county that goes through ODOT. She pointed out that the
figures listed in the presentation come from ODOT because it is the oversight agency of NOACA’s
funding.
Mr. Lane mentioned that project funding recommendations will be presented to the NOACA Board
of Directors for approval on September 13, 2019. He noted that staff will work with the sponsors
of approved projects to finalize the scopes, schedules and budgets for incorporation into the draft
SFY 2021-2024 TIP. The final draft TIP will be presented to PPC for approval on January 17,
2020, and to the Board for approval on March 13, 2020.

1-3

 A motion was made by Mr. Higgins to recommend the SFY 2021-2024 TIP Development to the
Executive Committee. The motion was seconded by Mr. Bob Klaiber. The motion passed by
voice vote.
Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) Program
Ms. Gallucci mentioned that ODOT technically controls how CMAQ funds are distributed.
Mr. Lane stated that CMAQ funds are allocated based on air quality and the entire population in
Ohio. Ms. Gallucci mentioned that ODOT keeps some of the funds for itself and provides some
funds for a competitive process through the MPOs.
Mr. Lane provided background on the CMAQ program and reviewed eligible project types; project
evaluation; statewide project evaluation criteria; and regional priority.
Mr. Lane presented a list of 2019 CMAQ funding requests totaling $31.4 million. He noted that
NOACA staff is recommending seven projects on the list for a total of $28.8 million in CMAQ
funding. He also presented three projects that will not be recommended to the Board: Lorain
County Metro Parks - Sheffield Village Connector; City of Chardon Traffic Signal Upgrade; and
the Cleveland Metroparks - West Creek Greenway project.
Ms. Gallucci stated that the Loran County Metro Parks and Cleveland Metroparks projects were
not being recommended because they were recreation, not transportation; and the Chardon
signal upgrade project was not being recommended because it did not meet the criteria of
congestion mitigation.
Mr. Lane stated that projects selected for the region will establish the initial CMAQ budgets for
SFY 2024-2025. He noted that upon Board approval, projects will be submitted to the Statewide
CMAQ Program Committee for evaluation against other statewide projects in October 2019. The
CMAQ Committee will then submit project recommendations to the OARC Executive Directors for
final approval in November 2019.
A motion was made by Mayor Sam Alai to recommend the regional priority of projects to be
implemented in SFY 2024-2025 with CMAQ program funds to the Executive Committee. The
motion was seconded by Mayor Pamela Bobst. The motion passed by voice vote.
Transportation Review Advisory Council (TRAC) Regional Priorities
Ms. Sarli stated that eligible projects must have a total cost greater than $12 million. She
mentioned that TRAC is requesting priority order from NOACA, which is due before the public
hearing on July 18, 2019. Ms. Sarli provided an overview of TRAC applications for the following
projects:
•
•
•
•
•

City of Brecksville - I-77-Miller Road Interchange / SUM-77-32.30
City of Cleveland - CUY-Thrive 105-93
Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority - GCRTA Rail Car Replacement
Ohio Department of Transportation – District 3 - Medina SR-18 Corridor
Ohio Rail Development Commission (ORDC) - Cleveland, OH - Bessemer Avenue
project - CUY CR 800-1.46

Ms. Sarli mentioned that the City of Brecksville submitted an application for the I-77-Miller Road
Interchange / SUM-77-32.30.

8291c

1-4

 Ms. Gallucci stated that the Miller Road Interchange has not been included in NOACA’s longrange transportation plan, which has been noted to TRAC upon submission by the City of
Brecksville. Ms. Gallucci stated that the Board will still need to review the interchange and
determine whether or not to move forward with it.
Ms. Sarli stated that PPC’s recommendations for regional priorities will be communicated to TRAC
prior to the requested due date of July 18, 2019.
Mr. Bob Weaver asked how projects were ranked based on NOACA’s five goals.
Ms. Sarli stated that NOACA’s five goals are as follows:
•
•
•
•
•

Goal 1: STRENGTHEN regional cohesion
Goal 2: PRESERVE existing infrastructure
Goal 3: BUILD a sustainable, multi-modal transportation system
Goal 4: SUPPORT economic development
Goal 5: ENHANCE quality of life in Northeast Ohio

Ms. Sarli stated that she looked at the objectives of each goal when she prioritized the projects.
Ms. Gallucci mentioned that the five goals were derived from NOACA’s Regional Strategic Plan
and noted that the details of the objectives can be found on NOACA’s website under planning
documents.
Mr. Weaver stated that he believed the Medina project meets more than two of NOACA’s goals
and that ODOT has a real opportunity to get TRAC funding to complete the project. He said he
would like NOACA to rank the project higher. Ms. Sarli said NOACA supports the Medina project.
A motion was made by Ms. Susan Infeld to approve the TRAC project priorities. The motion was
seconded by Mayor Brennan.
Mayor Alai asked if NOACA funds will be used for the I-77 widening project outside of Medina
County. He also asked what has changed since the last improvements made in the area.
Ms. Sarli said ODOT District 4 is planning to widen I-77 up to the county line. She noted that
there is some potential development that will occur at the interchange, which will add a lot of extra
traffic. She also noted that the area is already congested and at a Level of Service F.
Ms. Gallucci stated that the plan development on the old VA hospital site is driving the project.
She noted that upon review by NOACA staff, the project would not warrant the interchange
modifications without the development and the I-77 widening project. She also noted that the
application was submitted before approval by the NOACA Board for inclusion in the long-range
transportation plan. She said the project will be brought to PPC for full vetting prior to presenting
it to the Board for approval. She stated that a project can be submitted to TRAC without being
presented to the MPO; however, the sponsor cannot spend any money on the project without
MPO approval.
Ms. Gallucci mentioned that Mayor Jerry Hruby, along with Brecksville’s consultant, contacted
NOACA about performing a study for the Miller Road Interchange.

8291c

1-5

 Mr. Klaiber asked if the sponsor could get the project approved by TRAC and then come back to
NOACA to get the project put on the plan. Ms. Gallucci said yes and noted that it would need to
be communicated to ODOT.
PPC voted and the motion passed by voice vote.
Avon Lake/LORCO Phase I FPA – Lorain County FPA Modification along Hawke Road in
Columbia Township
Mr. Eric Akin stated that Lorain County Rural Wastewater District (LORCO) submitted to NOACA
a modification request to transfer one parcel (1 acre) from Lorain County FPA to Avon
Lake/LORCO Phase I FPA. He noted that the modification request does not include prescription
changes. He stated that the affected parties are Lorain County, LORCO, City of Avon Lake and
Columbia Township.
Mr. Akin reviewed the affected area, provided an overview of the Hawke Road Agreement, and
discussed the notification requirement and analysis. Mr. Akin stated that with Board approval,
NOACA staff will submit the FPA update to the Ohio EPA for certification by the Governor.
Following Board approval, staff will transmit copies of the resolution to the appropriate federal,
state and local agencies.
A motion was made by Councilman Griffin to recommend the Avon Lake/LORCO Phase I FPA –
Lorain County FPA modification to the Executive Committee. The motion was seconded by Mr.
Richard Heidecker. The motion passed by voice vote.

NORTHEAST OHIO AREAWIDE COORDINATING AGENCY
MEMORANDUM
TO:

NOACA Planning and Programming Committee

FROM:

Grace Gallucci, Executive Director

DATE:

October 4, 2019

RE:

Project Planning Reviews – 2nd Quarter State Fiscal Year (SFY) 2020

ACTION REQUESTED
The Committee is asked to consider recommending this item to the Executive Committee for placement on
the Board of Director’s December agenda. Specifically, the item proposes that the projects have completed
the Project Planning Review (PPR) process.
The Transportation Subcommittee supports this recommendation.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION
NOACA’s Board approved Regional Transportation Investment Policy requires that all proposed federal-aid
transportation projects be processed through PPR in order to meet NOACA’s adopted goals and federal
requirements.
PPR consists of four levels of review: NOACA staff; Board, including committees, subcommittees, and
councils: intergovernmental review and consultation (IGRC); and public involvement. The end product of
PPR is a Board resolution that certifies that the project has had thorough review, allowing the project to
proceed to the programming stages of the planning process.
The second quarter PPR covers roadway and transit projects sponsored by the City of Brecksville, Ohio
Department of Transportation (ODOT) and GCRTA.
Detailed information about the projects can be found at:
i. Roadway Projects in Cuyahoga County
ii. RTA Fiscal Year 2020 Capital Grant Program
As part of the PPR process, a detailed summary of the proposed improvement and staff and committee
assessment of the project are posted on NOACA’s website, www.NOACA.org. A link to the PPR is included
on the home page by clicking the ‘Comment on Projects’ button. Staff adds comments obtained from the
public, governmental organizations and NOACA committees as they are received. Proposed projects are
posted on the website for three months, allowing adequate time for review and comment.
5-1

 FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
With Board approval, the project sponsor will be notified that their project has completed PPR. NOACA staff
will work with the project sponsor to address any planning issues identified during PPR prior to amendment
to the Transportation Improvement Program (TIP).

 NORTHEAST OHIO AREAWIDE COORDINATING AGENCY
MEMORANDUM
TO:

NOACA Planning and Programming Committee

FROM:

Grace Gallucci, Executive Director

DATE:

October 4, 2019

RE:

Plan and TIP Amendments – 2nd Quarter State Fiscal Year (SFY) 2020

ACTION REQUESTED
The Committee is asked to consider recommending this item to the Executive Committee for
placement on the Board of Directors’ December agenda. Specifically, this item directs that
NOACA’s long-range transportation plan (Plan) and the Transportation Improvement Program
(TIP) be amended to include the proposed projects as indicated. Please note that some of the
projects listed are to be amended to both the Plan and TIP and others to the TIP.
The Transportation Subcommittee supports this action.
BACKGROUND
The proposed amendments to the Transportation Plan (Plan) and the state fiscal year (SFY) 2018
– 2021 Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) are being processed through project planning
review (PPR). The projects include roadway and transit projects sponsored by the City of
Brecksville, the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) and GCRTA.
The proposed amendments also include a project sponsored by ODOT, which was processed
through project planning review (Resolution 2018-038) and amended to the TIP (Resolution
2018-039), in December 2018. The project (CUY SR 176 - 10.13: PID No. 101941) involves
improvements at the SR-176 and IR-480 interchange, in Cleveland and Brooklyn Heights. The
project’s construction cost was originally estimated at $12,000,000. The sponsor reports that
the construction cost estimate has increased 23 percent ($2,713,000) to $14,713,000, which
requires amendment of the project in the TIP.
NOACA’s Regional Transportation Investment Policy states that projects already on the TIP
that request a significant change of scope or cost (greater than 20 percent) must go through
PPR again. However, project sponsors may appeal this 20 percent requirement if it can be
shown that the cost increases were a result of an increase in material costs or inflation.
The project’s revised construction cost is the result of an increase in material costs attributable
to more complicated maintenance of traffic and more extensive undercut, which affects the
underdrain system. The costs associated with these activities and materials is consistent with
NOACA policy.
5 - 17

 The proposed amendments also include a project sponsored by Laketran processed through
project planning review (Resolution 2019-014) and amended to the TIP (Resolution 2019-015).
The project (LAK WICKLIFFE PARK & RIDE LOT RECONSTRUCTION: PID No. 108885)
involves reconstruction of the park and ride lot in Wickliffe to accommodate electric charging
infrastructure. The cost of the reconstruction of the park and ride lot was originally estimated at
$750,000, but is now estimated to be $2,350,000, which encompasses $944,816 in Section 5307
funding and the remainder in Laketran local share. The increase is over the maximum allowable
threshold for a project this size.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The cost of the proposed projects being amended to the Plan and TIP is $240 million. Funding
for these projects is committed and/or planned from a variety of federal, state, and local sources.
Federal funding is provided by the Federal Highway Administration and the Federal Transit
Administration and administered through the Ohio Department of Transportation.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
With Board approval, the amendments will be incorporated into the NOACA Plan and/or
statewide TIP amendment in January 2020.

MEMORANDUM
TO:

NOACA Planning and Programming Committee

FROM:

Grace Gallucci, Executive Director

DATE:

October 4, 2019

RE:

Functional Classification Amendment Recommendations

ACTION REQUESTED
The Committee is asked to consider recommending this item to the Executive Committee for
placement on the Board of Director’s December agenda. Specifically, this action would
recommend approval of the functional classification amendments.
The Transportation Subcommittee supports this action.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION FOR CURRENT ACTION
The Ohio Department of Transportation has requested the following functional classification
amendments:
•
•
•
•

Remove E 30th, from I-77 WB exit ramp to Broadway; Broadway (SR 14), from E 30th to
E 14th; and E14th Street, from Broadway to Orange Ave., from the I-90 WB Intermodal
Connector OH 56T (Tower City).
Add Prospect Ave., from the I-90 WB exit ramp to Tower City to the I-90 WB Intermodal
Connector OH 56T (Tower City).
Revise 500 feet of E14th Street, from Broadway Ave. to Orange Ave., from a principal
arterial to a major collector.
Add 210 feet of SR 87 – Shaker Boulevard in both directions to Connector OH 82T from
the RTA station at approximately E 130th Street to the east leg of the Shaker Square
Loop (CR 62) which will also join with Connector OH 84T.

Functional Classification is the grouping of roads, streets, and highways in a hierarchy based on
the type of highway service they provide. Streets and highways are part of an interconnected
network, and each one plays a role in moving traffic throughout the system. Generally, streets
and highways provide either traffic mobility or land access and can be ranked in terms of the
proportion of service they perform.

5 - 29

 In June 2014 the NOACA Board of Directors approved Resolution Number 2014-025, which
created a NOACA functional classification policy for the review of proposed functional
classification revisions. The policy requires all proposed functional classification revisions to be
evaluated thoroughly prior to making a recommendation to the Ohio Department of
Transportation. Evaluation is based on guidelines suggested by the Federal Highway
Administration (FHWA) and the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) with some criteria
refined to reflect local conditions. Criteria evaluated includes:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Lane widths
Shoulder widths
Average Annual Daily Traffic (AADT)
Access
Speed limit
Parallel spacing of routes
Area type
Percentage of mileage by functional classification (by region, by county)
Functional classification density analysis

Based on the NOACA Functional Classification Amendment Policy, Staff recommends the
proposed ODOT amendments.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
No financial impact, but approval of the functional classification recommendations could add
additional mileage to the federal-aid network.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Pending Board approval, these recommendations will be forwarded to ODOT and FHWA for
further review and implementation.

NOACA Planning and Programming Committee

FROM:

Grace Gallucci, Executive Director

DATE:

October 4, 2019

RE:

Enhanced Mobility for Seniors and Individuals With Disabilities (Section 5310)
Program Funding Recommendations

ACTION REQUESTED
The Committee is asked to consider recommending this item to the Executive Committee for placement on
the Board of Director’s December agenda. Specifically this action, would recommend approval of the
SFY20 Enhanced Mobility for Seniors and Individuals with Disabilities (Section 5310) Program Project
Recommendations.
The Transportation Subcommittee supports this action.
BACKGROUND
The Enhanced Mobility for Seniors and Individuals with Disabilities (Section 5310) Program addresses the
special transportation needs of seniors and individuals with disabilities. NOACA seeks to eliminate barriers
and improve transportation options in Northeast Ohio for older adults, individuals with disabilities, and
people of low income through the coordination of resources and efforts of public transit operators, human
service agencies, and other transportation providers. Furthermore, NOACA will encourage the efficient and
effective use of resources by eliminating gaps and redundancies in transportation services.
The total amount apportioned to the region for federal fiscal year 2019 was $ 1,809,255, of which $ 180,925
(10%) will be retained by NOACA for program planning and administration. The remaining $ 1,628,330 is
available to be programmed for new projects. NOACA has designated at least 60% of funding for transit
agency project proposals and up to 40% for non-profits, for-profits, and government agencies awarded
through a competitive application process. There are also carryover funds from previous years totaling
$ 53,424 which will be applied to this program of projects. The total funding available to be programmed for
new projects this year is $1,681,754. Capital projects are funded at 80% with a 20% local match from
awardees. Transit agencies are eligible for operations funding at 50% federal funding with a 50% local
match.

 NOACA accepted project proposals and applications from July 3, 2019 to August 7, 2019. NOACA received
two transit project proposals requesting $2,300,582 and 21 competitive applications from municipalities,
non-profits, for-profits, and social service agencies requesting $1,520,371. Project proposals and
applications have been evaluated against program eligibility and prioritization criteria contained in the
Program Management Plan. Project recommendations are attached.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is $ 1,809,255 in FTA funds available to the Cleveland Urbanized Area from Federal Fiscal Year 2019.
$ 180,925 will be used by NOACA for program administration. There is an additional $53,424 in carryover
funds from previous years to be added to the available funding, totaling $1,681,754.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Pending Board approval, NOACA will manage the SFY 2020 program to ensure the expenditure of all
available funding during the fiscal year, including the advancement of additional projects as approved by the
Board should funding become available.

MEMORANDUM
TO:

NOACA Planning and Programming Committee

FROM:

Grace Gallucci, Executive Director

DATE:

October 4, 2019

RE:

Facility Planning Area (FPA) Modification Request: Transfer of one (1) parcel from the
Willoughby-Eastlake FPA to the Lake County FPA in City of Willoughby

ACTION REQUESTED
The Planning and Programming Committee is asked to consider recommending this item to the Planning and
Programming Committee for placement on the Board of Directors’ December 2019 meeting agenda.
Specifically, the item will transfer one (1) parcel (5.4 acres) from the Willoughby-Eastlake FPA to the Lake
County FPA in the City of Willoughby.
The Water Quality Subcommittee unanimously voted to support this recommendation, but lacked a quorum
to take official action.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION FOR CURRENT ACTION
The Ridgewood Green Subdivision is proposed at the former Johnnycake Ridge Golf Course in the Cities of
Mentor and Willoughby. The majority of the 55.2-acre development will be within the City of Mentor and the
Lake County Facility Planning Area (FPA), but 5.4 acres will extend into the City of Willoughby and the
Willoughby-Eastlake FPA. Both municipalities have approved the project.
The approved subdivision plan calls for Lake County Department of Utilities (LCDU) to provide sewer
service. However, the portion of the development within the City of Willoughby is not within the Lake
County FPA (Attachment A). With the current FPA boundary location, LCDU future sewer connections
within the City of Willoughby are inconsistent with NOACA’s Clean Water 2000 Plan (208 Plan). All sanitary
sewer connections must be within the FPA of the WWTP that treats the wastewater. Under the federal
Clean Water Act, Ohio EPA cannot issue a Permit-to-Install (PTI) for a project that conflicts with NOACA’s
208 Plan.
The FPA boundary modification is needed so the entire subdivision can be served by gravity sewers that
will flow to the LCDU sanitary sewer line along Mentor Avenue in the City of Mentor (Attachment B). The
developer investigated the extension of the City of Willoughby sewers to serve the portion of the subdivision
within the City of Willoughby. However, the nearest sewer along Johnnycake Ridge Road would require a
pump station for the homes to connect to the sewer. This option was determined not to be feasible due to
the small number of homes planned for that portion of the subdivision. The Willoughby sewer line along
Gardenside Drive to the west of the subdivision has limited capacity and the Willoughby City Engineer
recommended against adding additional flow to that sewer.

5 - 35

 The affected jurisdictions are the City of Willoughby and Lake County. The City of Eastlake is a co-owner of
the Willoughby-Eastlake Water Pollution Control Center (WPCC) which serves the Willoughby-Eastlake
FPA. All three (3) jurisdictions submitted letters of support for the FPA modification request, which fulfills
the notification requirements in Policy 4-6 of the 208 Plan.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
NOACA’s approval of the boundary change will not result in any financial impact to NOACA.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Pending Board approval, NOACA staff will submit the updated FPA boundary to Ohio EPA.

RE: Request for Proposed Faciltiy Planning Area (FPA) Amendment
Ridgewood Greens Subdivision - Willoughby Mentor
Bedados. LLC
Letter of Support

Dear Ms. Schwickerath:

Reference is made to your letter with attachments dated 'April 24, 2019. detailing a new subdivision
located in the Cities of Mentor and Willoughby and in specific, the proposed point of connection
for the new sanitary sewers to service the subdivision.

It is understood from the documents provided that of the 119 lots in the subdivision, 112 lots exist
within the Lake County Utilities Department FPA while the remaining 7 exist in the
Willoughby?Eastiake FPA. It is further understood that having considered several alternates, the
best and most effective way to service the 7 lots would be to have them connected to sewers in the
LCUD FPA. To effect the best alternative requires that the 7 lots be placed under the auspices of
the LCUD FPA.

As a community within the Willoughby-Eastlake FPA, The City of Eastlake by copy of the letter
offers its support in favor of the proposed change in FPA for the aforementioned 7 lots. Should
additional documentation or legislation related to this matter be required, please contact me.

Thank you for your consideration.

Mayor Dennis Morley

 Staff Comments:
A new residential development, Ridgewood Greens Subdivision, is planned for the
former Johnnycake Ridge Golf Course in the Cities of Mentor and Willoughby. The
majority of the development, 112 out of 119 single family lots, is within the City of
Mentor. The remaining seven (7) lots will be in the City of Willoughby. Both
municipalities have approved the subdivision.
The approved development plans show the homes served by gravity sanitary sewers
connected to the existing Lake County Department of Utilities (LCDU) sewer line along
Mentor Avenue. This sewer line is within the Lake County FPA. However, the portion of
the proposed subdivision within the City of Willoughby is in the Willoughby-Eastlake FPA
and not the Lake County FPA. Under the federal Clean Water Act, sanitary sewer
connections must be within the FPA of the plant that treats the sewage. Therefore, the
portion of the development within the City of Willoughby needs to be transferred into the
Lake County FPA in order to be served by LCDU sewers.
Alternative sewer plans to maintain the existing FPA boundary were considered.
However, the existing City of Willoughby sanitary sewer along Johnnycake Ridge Road
is not deep enough to serve the seven (7) proposed lots within the City of Willoughby. A
pump station would be needed to connect these parcels to the sewer along Johnnycake
Ridge Road, but would not be cost effective with so few lots. The City of Willoughby
sewer line along Gardenside Drive to the west is not a viable sewer option because of
existing capacity issues, according to the Willoughby City Engineer.
The current Prescriptions for Wastewater Treatment (Prescriptions) allow for sanitary
sewer connections to the proposed site, so no change is required.
The affected jurisdictions are Lake County and the City of Willoughby. Both jurisdictions
support the proposed FPA modification. The City of Eastlake co-owns the WilloughbyEastlake Water Pollution Control Center (WPCC) and is also in support of the request.
The FPA modification notification requirements in Policy 4-6 of NOACA’s Clean Water
2000 Plan (208 Plan) have been fulfilled.
Staff Disposition:
The staff recommends approval of the proposed FPA boundary modification between
the Lake County FPA and Willoughby-Eastlake FPA. The Lake County sanitary sewer
line along Mentor Avenue can serve the entire proposed subdivision with gravity sewers.
The nearest sanitary sewers within the City of Willoughby are either not deep enough to
provide gravity sewer service to the new lots or do not have the capacity for additional
flow from the subdivision.

RE:

Facility Planning Area (FPA) Modification Request: Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer
District (NEORSD) – Heights Hilltop FPA Boundary and Prescriptions Modification in
the Village of Moreland Hills

ACTION REQUESTED
The Planning and Programming Committee is asked to consider recommending this item to the Planning and
Programming Committee for placement on the Board of Directors’ December 2019 meeting agenda.
Specifically, the item will:
•

Add four (4) parcels (6.9 acres) currently not within an FPA to the NEORSD – Heights Hilltop FPA;
and

•

Change the Prescriptions for Wastewater Treatment (Prescriptions) for the parcels within the
proposed modification area to make sanitary sewer connections consistent with the Clean Water 2000
Plan (208 Plan).

The Water Quality Subcommittee unanimously voted to support this recommendation, but lacked a quorum
to take official action.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION FOR CURRENT ACTION
An area on the southeast corner of State Route 91 (Som Center Road) and Hiram Trail in the Village of
Moreland Hills has been subdivided twice since 2014 to create four (4) lots. Three (3) of the lots are along
Hiram Trail and are undeveloped residential properties. The fourth lot has an existing home that is served
by an on-site sewage treatment system. A condition of the lot splits imposed by the Village of Moreland
Hills was any new development would connect to sanitary sewers. However, NOACA’s 208 Plan shows the
four (4) lots are not currently within an FPA and have a Prescription that does not allow for sanitary sewer
connections (Attachment A). The extension of sanitary sewers to these lots is not consistent NOACA’s
current 208 Plan. Under the federal Clean Water Act, Ohio EPA cannot issue a Permit-to-Install (PTI) for a
sanitary sewer extensions that conflicts with NOACA’s 208 Plan.
The Village of Moreland Hills requested an FPA modification to transfer the parcels into the NEORSD –
Heights Hilltop FPA and change the Prescriptions within the modification area to “sewers expected within 20
years” (Attachment B). The proposed changes would make sanitary sewer connections for all four (4)
parcels consistent with NOACA’s 208 Plan and fulfill the lot split approval condition for the three (3)
undeveloped parcels along Hiram Trail.

5 - 47

 The affected jurisdictions are the Village of Moreland Hills and NEORSD. Both support the proposed FPA
modification request which fulfills the notification requirements in Policy 4-6 of the 208 Plan.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
NOACA’s approval of the boundary change will not result in any financial impact to NOACA.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Pending Board approval, NOACA staff will submit the updated FPA boundary to Ohio EPA.

Re: Facilities Planning Area (FPA) Modification Moreland Hills
Hiram Trail Sanitary Sewer Extension

Dear Ms. Gallucci:

On August 7, 2019, the Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District (NEORSD) received a request
seeking support for the proposed modification of the NEORSD Heights-Hilltop Facilities Planning
Area (FPA) with the addition of four (4) parcels along Hiram Trail and SOM Center Road in
Moreland Hills (see attached parcel list and map).

Based on the information submitted with the request, Moreland Hills is proposing to extend a
sanitary sewer along Hiram Trail in order to facilitate new development on three (3) of the
parcels. The area tributary to the Hiram Trail Sanitary Sewer extension is already within
service area. Therefore, we concur with the proposed FPA modification.

If you have any questions or if you should need additional information, please contact Mary
Maciejowski at (216) 881-6600, ext. 6466.

Sincerely,

@m?t

 Staff Comments:
The Village of Moreland Hills requests an FPA Boundary and Prescription modification in
order to allow four (4) parcels along State Route 91 and Hiram Trail to connect to
sanitary sewers. The area was originally a single parcel that was split into four (4)
parcels in 2014 and 2018. The three new parcels along Hiram Trail are not yet
developed. A condition of the lot split approval from the Village of Moreland Hills was
that newly constructed homes would connect to sanitary sewers. The proposed FPA
modification area is currently not within an FPA and has the Prescription of “area served
by on-site systems” which does not allow for extension of sanitary sewers.
The FPA modification area is within the sanitary sewer service agreement area between
the Village of Moreland Hills and NEORSD. Both entities support the proposed transfer.
Staff Disposition:
Staff recommend approval of the proposed FPA modifications to extend the NEORSD –
Heights Hilltop FPA along State Route 91 and Hiram Trail. The FPA Boundary and
Prescription changes will allow for sanitary sewers to serve three newly split parcels
along Hiram Trail. Both the Village and NEORSD are in support of the FPA modification.

PRESENTATION AND DISCUSSION ITEMS

 

NORTHEAST OHIO AREAWIDE COORDINATING AGENCY
MEMORANDUM
TO:

NOACA Planning and Programming Committee

FROM:

Grace Gallucci, Executive Director

DATE:

October 4, 2019

RE:

Electric Vehicle Charging Station Plan Update

ACTION REQUESTED
No action is requested at this time. This item is for presentation and discussion only.
BACKGROUND/INFORMATION
Nationally, the number of Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEV) is projected to reach 18.7 million in
2030, up from slightly more than 1 million at the end of 2018. Thus, creating a nationwide
infrastructure network is critical to support the travel resulting from increasing adoption rates of
the new technology. Even more important to NOACA is the impact on our region and the
challenge to ensure adequate infrastructure for our communities. As NOACA supports and
encourages consumer adoption of PEV’s in order to improve air quality in this region,
developing a planning study to identify PEV charging station sites for deployment is a priority.
The study documents the current status, and projected growth of PEVs over the next ten years
in the NOACA region, and focuses on the implementation of charging stations at workplace and
other publically accessible locations, representing both Level 2 and Direct Current Fast Charge
(DCFC) station types respectively. The Committee will be updated on the progress of the study
at the meeting.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
None
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
The Committee will continue to be updated on the Electric Vehicle Charging Station Plan and
determine the potential policy implications.
