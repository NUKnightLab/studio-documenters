TAXING DISTRICT DEBT DISCLOSURE ORDINANCE.
Transmitting a
Communication, dated April 21, 2009 from Maria Pappas, Cook County Treasurer
by Michael J. Shine, Chief Deputy Treasurer:
submitting a proposed Taxing District Debt Disclosure Ordinance that would
provide transparency in government and further the goal of full disclosure to
Taxpayers.
Taxpayers are entitled to have readily available to them full disclosure of all debts
and liabilities of each taxing district. With few exceptions, this information is
prepared as a matter of course each fiscal year and would not require additional
accounting work from taxing districts.
This proposed ordinance creates a single electronic repository which would allow
taxpayers to electronically access the financial information they need to make
informed decisions about the taxing districts they support. The Treasurer's Office
website would house and maintain the electronic infrastructure where each taxing
district would be able to upload their information and make that information
electronically available to taxpayers.
