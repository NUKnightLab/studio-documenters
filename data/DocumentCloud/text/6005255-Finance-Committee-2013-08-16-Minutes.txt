III. Action Items (continued)
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (Attachment #1)
Gina Besenhofer, System Director of Supply Chain Management, provided an overview of the requests
presented for the Committee’s consideration. The Committee reviewed and discussed the requests.
Ms. Besenhofer noted that, on the September agenda, there will be a Committee Education Item presented
regarding contracting.
With regard to the proposed grant renewals, Board Chairman Carvalho stated that an issue arose a couple of
years ago regarding grants received that, over time, end up costing the System more than it was receiving to
provide the services, because the grant funding remained flat, and the System’s costs go up for a variety of
reasons each year. Specifically, this is regarding grants received for services that the County is not mandated
to do; this is for grant-funded services that a number of other vendors can do. At that time, the Board decided
to continue receiving those grants and providing those services at a loss; however, at that time, he and other
Directors had requested that the Board be provided with information in the future with respect to the financial
implications relating to those type of grants that are presented for the Board’s approval. He recalled that this
was the case in the past with regard to the grant for Supplemental Nutrition for Women, Infants and Children
(WIC); he asked if this was still the case.
Dr. Terry Mason, Chief Operating Officer of the Cook County Department of Public Health, responded that
there are some analyses available for request number 1 and 2; he stated that he will forward that to the Board
prior to the Board Meeting1. With respect to the other grants presented today for consideration besides WIC,
he stated that many are not in that condition, because there are vacancies that have not been filled that relate to
those grant services. Board Chairman Carvalho noted that, if those particular vacancies are carried throughout
the year, the System runs the risk of not providing the deliverables that are required under the grant if it does
not have enough staffing for the functions relating to the grant.
With regard to request number 8, Ms. Besenhofer noted that this is the first of two amendments for
PsycHealth. The second proposed amendment is expected to be presented in September; that amendment will
be to provide a fee-for-service mechanism to reimburse providers outside of PsycHealth’s per-member permonth (PMPM) contract.
Additional discussion took place on request number 8. Dr. Ram Raju, Chief Executive Officer, provided
additional information. He stated that, when CountyCare was negotiated with the State and the Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the benefit packages that were included mostly reflected the State’s
Medicaid medical benefits packages. The Waiver needed to be dollar neutral, and with that in mind, there was
a set of benefits put in as a part of the deal; subsequently it was determined that some of these people require
residential substance abuse treatment, part of the State’s Medicaid substance abuse benefit package and that it
should have been included in the CountyCare benefit package at the onset.
During the Committee’s discussion of request number 10, a request to execute a contract with Siemens
Medical Solutions, Board Chairman Carvalho requested that information be compiled for the Board meeting
that shows how the scope of the new contract differs from the cumulated scopes of the former contract2.
Director Hammock, seconded by Director Wiese, moved the approval of request
numbers 1 through 12. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

IV. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
A. Discussion of 2013 Meeting schedule and planning for schedule of 2014 Committee Meetings
Following discussion, the Committee determined that the schedule of remaining 2013 Finance Committee
Meetings does not require any adjustments at this time.
With regard to planning for the schedule of 2014 Committee Meetings, the consensus reached by the
Committee indicated that they were not in favor of holding the Committee Meetings and Board Meeting on
the same day.

B. Update on Section 1115 Medicaid Waiver Demonstration Project/CountyCare (Attachment #2)
Steven Glass, Executive Director of Managed Care, provided an update on the Section 1115 Medicaid Waiver
Demonstration Project/CountyCare. The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
Board Chairman Carvalho inquired regarding the typical reason for the 10-12% of the applications that are
denied. Mr. Glass stated that, from his prior experience with the program, one tends to see many denials
relating to income eligibility; what is reported at the time of application is not necessarily what pans out when
the State does their assessment – that tends to be the bulk of the denials.
Dr. Raju stated that, with regard to next year’s budget, a lot of it depends on CountyCare. Continuing
CountyCare as a strategic goal and initiative for the System is critical. The System is well on its way to get the
115,000 applications initiated.
On December 31st, the Demonstration Project ends; at that point, the
administration really needs to get CountyCare into some other status, so that it can continue to be a plan. First
and foremost, the administration has to receive approval for CountyCare to be a managed care community
network (MCCN); a team of staff is currently working on that application. Dr. Raju stated that the
administration is also in consultations with the State, in order to work towards making CountyCare a plan so
that it will be able to compete at the marketplace in October; to do that, it should become a plan by April 1st, so
there are some legislative changes that will need to be done. There are ongoing discussions regarding this
subject, and there is a lot of collaboration with the State. This will do two things – it will allow the System to
continue to enroll Medicaid patients into CountyCare, and it will help to capture the other group of people,
those between 133-400% of the federal poverty level, who will be eligible to buy insurance in the marketplace,
and for whom the federal government subsidizes their premiums.
Board Chairman Carvalho inquired whether the strategy for the conversion of CountyCare includes
CountyCare becoming an entity that can be a managed care entity under the regular Medicaid Program. Dr.
Raju responded affirmatively.
The Committee received and filed the update on the Section 1115 Medicaid Waiver Demonstration
Project/CountyCare without objection.

C. Introduction of CCHHS FY2014 Preliminary Budget (Attachment #3)
Aaron Galeener, System Director of Budget, provided an overview of the information presented regarding the
proposed CCHHS FY2014 Preliminary Budget. The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.

IV. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
C. Introduction of CCHHS FY2014 Preliminary Budget (continued)
With regard to the question of the timeframe for approval, Dr. Raju indicated that the hope is that the System
Board will approve the proposed Preliminary Budget in time for it to be placed on the County Board’s Agenda
for their consideration on September 11th. Chairman Butler inquired whether it can be approved at the System
Board’s August 23rd Meeting. Board Chairman Carvalho stated that it will be placed on the System Board’s
August 23rd Agenda for their consideration; it could be approved if the Board feels that, after today’s Finance
Committee Meeting and the public hearings next week, they are ready to approve it; however, he did not want
to suggest that by putting it on the agenda that it has to be approved on August 23rd - a notation will be listed on
the agenda to that effect. If the Board is not ready to approve it on the 23rd, another meeting can be scheduled
for that purpose.
Board Chairman Carvalho suggested that the title of Account #890 be changed from Health System
Administration to System-wide Expenditures, as it is actually the place where expenditures are aggregated that
benefit the System as a whole. Additionally, he requested that the following additional information be
included in time for the Board Meeting: include what is projected to actually be spent in 2013, as opposed to
what is proposed to be spent in 2013, and as opposed to what was budgeted for 20133.
In response to concerns expressed by Mr. Oder regarding the proposed Preliminary Budget and related
assumptions, Dr. Raju stated that, over the last two years, a number of revenue shortfalls have been
considerably reduced. This year, it could have been reduced further if not for the delay in the processing of the
Waiver applications. There are a lot of factors that play into when and how much money the System receives,
and from where. A lot of the assumptions for next year are not based on the number of people that the System
will retain, because the Federal Medical Assistance Percentages (FMAP) will essentially double the System’s
Medicaid rates at the present time; because the System is in a unique situation, those assumptions are the
reasons that the administration feels that it needs to start investing back into the System, as opposed to cutting
the System.
Chairman Butler inquired how delays in payment relating to the Waiver affect the System’s revenue stream.
Dr. Raju stated that, technically, it will affect the System’s cash flow. The way the Waiver was written, even if
the State approves an application in the month of April next year, they will pay the System retroactively to the
date of application. In terms of cash flow, when the fiscal year ends, there is going to be a deficit, because
there are close to 20,000 applications pending with the State at the present time; he noted that the staff from the
State is working very hard to catch up with processing the applications. However, moving forward, it is a
different population and different reimbursement mechanism; that is why it is believed that the budget targets
can be achieved.
The Committee referred the CCHHS FY2014 Preliminary Budget to the public hearings, which will be held on
the following dates, at 1900 W. Polk Street, in the second floor conference room, in Chicago, Illinois:
• Tuesday, August 20th at 6:00 P.M.
• Wednesday, August 21st at 8:00 A.M.
• Friday, August 23rd at 8:00 A.M.
Chairman Butler indicated that the notice for the public hearings will go out following this meeting.

VI. Report from Chief Financial Officer
A. Financial Reports – through July 2013 (Attachment #4)
John Cookinham, System Chief Financial Officer, presented the Financial Reports through July 2013. The
Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
Board Chairman Carvalho posed the following questions: what are the expenditures to date versus what was
budgeted; what are the revenues to date versus what was budgeted; and what is the anticipated projection at the
end of the fiscal year for both of those numbers?
Mr. Cookinham responded that, with regard to revenues to date, the System is short by $24 million; by the end
of the fiscal year, he projects that it will be short approximately $40 million. With regard to expenditures, he
indicated that that is a little harder to address; he believes that at the end of the fiscal year, the System will not
exceed the appropriation, but expenditures will be close to the original appropriation amount.
Board Chairman Carvalho asked Mr. Cookinham to clarify that the $135 million revenue shortfall reflected in
the Financial Reports is based on an accrual basis, as of today; however, on a cash basis, at the end of the year
the System is expecting the discrepancy to be around $40 million. Mr. Cookinham concurred. He stated that,
hopefully the System will have some savings on the appropriation side – that is a little more difficult to
measure; he indicated that he can return back to the Committee with more information on the subject.
The Committee received and filed the Financial Reports through July 2013 without objection.
VII. Adjourn
As the agenda was exhausted, Chairman Butler declared the meeting ADJOURNED.

members as a covered bene?t. Since these services were not a part of the initial pricing provided by Psyci-lealth,
this amendment provides the additional funding necessary to cover the expanded scope of work. This will increase
the totai contract spend to $10,051,50500.

 Update on Section 1115 Medicaid Waiver Demonstration Project (CountyCare)
CCHHS Finance Committee - Friday, 8/16/2013
Steven Glass, Executive Director, Managed Care
As of Sunday, 8/11/2013, 88,281 CountyCare applications have been initiated – this is a 10,000 increase
from the number reported to the Finance Committee at its July 2013 meeting.
The majority of apps (64%) have been initiated through our call center, our on-campus app assistors and
other program vendors; 31% have been initiated from our CountyCare network partners; with the
remaining 5% initiated from our work within Cermak Health Services of Cook County Jail.
We continue to submit approximately 500 applications to the Illinois Department of Human Services
(DHS) per day.
At the end of July, slightly more than 55,000 applications had been submitted to DHS for processing. Our
approval rate remains steady in the 88-90% range.
Just over 27,000 applications remain backlogged with the State as of July 31st. They are processing about
375 applications per day. Now that they are fully staffed, DHS has provided CountyCare leadership a plan
to get current with the backlog by the end of the waiver period. We are working together to monitor this
plan, and are jointly committed to ensuring each other’s success this first year.

 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
INTRODUCTION
This discussion and analysis provides the readers of the monthly unaudited financial
statements of the Cook County Health and Hospital System (CCHHS) with an overview
of the financial activities for the month ended July 31, 2013. This discussion focuses on
the significant financial issues and major financial activities during the current month. It
should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements of the
CCHHS.
The CCHHS includes the following entities: John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital (JSH), Oak
Forest Health Center (OFC) Provident Hospital (PHCC), the Department of Public Health
(DPH), the Ambulatory and Community Health Network (ACHN), the Bureau of Health
Services (BHS), CORE Center (for reporting purposes part of Stroger Hospital), and
Cermak Health Services (CHS). Starting this fiscal year 2013, we have added the 1115
Waiver. Collectively, these entities provide primary, intermediate, acute, and tertiary
medical care to patients, without regard to their ability to pay. The Bureau of Health
Services oversees the operational, planning, and policy activities of the CCHHS.
The CCHHS is included in the reporting entity of the Cook County, Illinois, as an
enterprise fund. As an enterprise fund, the CCHHS’ financial statements are prepared
using proprietary fund accounting that focuses on the determination of changes in net
assets, financial position, and cash flows in a manner similar to private sector businesses.
The financial statements are prepared on an accrual basis of accounting, which
recognizes revenue when earned and expenses when incurred.
In 2008 the Cook County Health and Hospital System Board was created by the Cook
County Board of Commissioners to provide independent oversight of health care
operations, and in 2010 the Cook County Board of Commissioners voted to make the
Cook County Health and Hospital System Board permanent.
In 2010 the Cook County Health and Hospital System Board and the Cook County Board
of Commissioners approved Vision 2015 Strategic Plan, which outlines, over five years,
restructuring CCHHS to deliver the best possible care for the vulnerable population of
Cook County within the constraints of dollar resources available to the health system.
This plan seeks to better allocate resources.
In 2012 the Cook County Health and Hospitals System and Cook County Board Officials
collaborated to cut Medicaid costs, help county taxpayers, and transform Cook County’s
hospital system by jump-starting national health care reform in Cook County. In October,
2012 the federal governmnent approved the 1115 Medicaid Waiver for Cook County,
allowing CCHHS to enroll more than 115,000 individuals who will be eligible for
Medicaid in 2014 into a Cook County network with no cost to the state of Illinois.
An 1115 Waiver allows the Cook County’s Health System to early enroll certain
uninsured patients into Medicaid. Specifically, these are patients who are not currently
5
Page 35 of 67

 eligible for Medicaid, but who will be eligible in 2014 under the Accountable Care Act.
Many of these individuals are patients who already are being treated by our system
without compensation. The Waiver is funded entirely by the federal government.

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS (IN THOUSANDS)
The Cook County Health and Hospitals System finished the eight months with overall
revenue of $505,631 and overall expenses was $640,989.
Net Patient revenue for the eight months was $286,160.
Net Patient revenue consists of all charges including automated contractual allowances
and bad debt adjustments. Write-off of Bad Debt is a CCHHS Board approved policy.
EHR incentive program revenue was $6,577.
Other revenue was $3,822. Other revenue consists primarily of parking revenue.

Patient Accounts Receivable – BEPA System
General
As compared to November 30, 2012, Total Patient Accounts Receivable at the end of
July-2013 reduced by 19 to 103 days. Additionally, there was a 6 day increase in this
figure, as compared to the previous month’s figure.
Days of Revenue Outstanding measures the average number of days charges remain in
accounts receivable after service has been rendered before collection activities have been
completed, including charity care and bad debt write-offs. Days of Revenue Outstanding
is measured in charges, not cash collections.
Days of Revenue Outstanding is a useful tool to measure collection efforts over time (i.e.,
whether this number is growing or decreasing). This number will be large due to the
large number of Self-Pay patients CCHHS services and the processes CCHHS must
complete before patient accounts are collected or written-off to bad debt. These
processes include, but are not limited to, the following:






Making an effort to attain third-party insurance coverage, including 1115 waiver
and MANG applications;
Processing charity care applications;
Sending three (3) monthly statements before accounts are turned over to
collections;
Placing accounts bi-monthly with the collection agency; and
Permitting patients to pay their account balances over time (time payment).

6
Page 36 of 67

 Total billed accounts grew by $20.481M (6.9%) as compared to the November-2012
balance. As compared to the previous month, this figure increased by $14.576M (4.8%).
The growth in this figure indicates more accounts are moving to a billed status, but a
decreasing number of accounts are completing the collection process, which includes
charity care and bad debt write-offs.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts, as
Medicaid pays CCHHS’ claims on a per-diem and Medicare pays CCHHS’ claims based
upon the diagnosis, regardless of charges on the patient accounts. Additionally, charity
care and bad debt write-offs are part of the collection process and will not result in actual
cash collections. Finally, the reimbursement for 1115 Waiver patients is made through a
per-member-per-month payment, not a claim-by-claim basis.
Inpatient Accounts Receivable – BEPA System
Discharged Not Final Billed
Inpatient discharged but not final billed accounts at the end of July-2013 increased by
$0.037M (0.4%), as compared the November 30, 2012 balance and decreased by
$2.624M (-22.8%), as compared to the previous month’s balance. This indicates that
more inpatient accounts are moving to a “Billed” status, as compared to the previous
month.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts, as
Medicaid pays CCHHS’ claims on a per-diem and Medicare pays CCHHS’ claims based
upon the diagnosis, regardless of charges on the patient accounts. Additionally, charity
care and bad debt write-offs are part of the collection process and will not result in actual
cash collections. Finally, the reimbursement for 1115 Waiver patients is made through a
per-member-per-month payment, not a claim-by-claim basis.
Billed Inpatient Accounts
Billed inpatient accounts at the end of July-2013 increased by $15.553M (10.0%) as
compared to the November 30, 2012 balance. This figure grew by $9.880M (6.1%)
compared to the previous month’s total.
The increase in this number indicates fewer accounts had the collection process
completed than in the previous month and that a lower number of accounts are being
removed from active accounts receivable. CCHHS’ collection process includes charity
care and bad debt write-offs.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts, as
Medicaid pays CCHHS’ claims on a per-diem and Medicare pays CCHHS’ claims based
up on the diagnosis, regardless of charges on the patient accounts. Additionally, charity
care and bad debt write-offs are part of the collection process and will not result in actual
cash collections. Finally, the reimbursement for 1115 Waiver patients is made through a
per-member-per-month payment, not a claim-by-claim basis.
Outpatient Accounts Receivable – BEPA System
7
Page 37 of 67

 Unbilled Outpatient Accounts
The balance of unbilled outpatient accounts decreased by $4.458M (-25.7%) by the end
of July-2013, as compared to the level of unbilled accounts as of November 30, 2012.
This balance, as of the end of this month, was $0.828M (6.9%) larger than the previous
month’s balance. This indicates that fewer outpatient accounts are moving to a “Billed”
status, as compared to the previous month.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts due
to Medicaid’s and Medicare’s reimbursement configuration.
Billed Outpatient Accounts
The billed outpatient accounts receivable at the end of July-2013 grew by $4.928M
(3.6%), as compared to the balance as of November 30, 2012. This figure is $4.696M
(3.4%) greater than last month’s figure.
The growth in this figure indicates that fewer Out-Patient accounts had their collection
and write-off related activities completed, as compared to the prior month.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts due
to Medicaid and Medicare’s reimbursement configuration and to charity care and bad
debt write-offs.

The above data does not include bad-debt write-offs; it includes only the amounts
written-off directly to charity care.

Operating Expenses at the end of eight months was $640.989M broken down as follows:
Salaries and Wages - $336.934M
Benefits - $92.583M
Supplies - $68.523M.
8
Page 38 of 67

 Purchased Services, Rental, and Other - $106.872M
Insurance - $7.845M.
Depreciation - $22.634M
Utilities - $5.597M

Nonoperating Revenue was $207.911M. The largest portions of this are attributed to
cigarette tax in the amount of $72.822M and property tax in the amount of $43.393M.
Sales tax revenues are recognized by CCHHS when earned; this occurs when the
underlying sales transactions occur. The amount recorded as Due from State of Illinois Sales Tax represents the amounts earned by CCHHS, however, the cash is not yet
received from the state. There is a 3 months lag from the time of the underlying sales
transaction to the receipt of funds.
Taxes collected for the Health to date have been fully credited to the Health Fund except
as mentioned in the previous paragraph.

OVERVIEW OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
This discussion and analysis are intended to serve as an introduction to the CCHHS
financial statements. CCHHS basic monthly unaudited financial statements are comprised
of fund financial statements.
A fund is a grouping of related accounts that is used to maintain control over resources
that have been segregated for specific activities or objectives. The CCHHS, like other
state and local governments, uses fund accounting to ensure and demonstrate compliance
with finance-related legal requirements.

Notes:
- ER Elopes are patients who leave without being seen by a physician.
- "Medicaid-Pending" assumes 30% of the Self-Pay accounts accepted by the eligibility vendor will be successfully converted to Medicaid accounts.
- The "Payer Type" represents the financial class in which the patient presented to CCHHS; it is not necessarily the final financial class for the patient, especially for Self-Pay patients.

Notes:
- ER Elopes are patients who leave without being seen by a physician.
- "Medicaid-Pending" assumes 30% of the Self-Pay accounts accepted by the eligibility vendor will be successfully converted to Medicaid accounts.
- The "Payer Type" represents the financial class in which the patient presented to CCHHS; it is not necessarily the final financial class for the patient, especially for Self-Pay patients.
