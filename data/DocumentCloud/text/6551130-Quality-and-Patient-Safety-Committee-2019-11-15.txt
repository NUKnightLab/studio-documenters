Counseling
Improve Post-Hospital Communication
and Follow-Up

• Annual attending-level education on best practices
and common pitfalls
• Cardiology consult for patients with advanced heart
failure
• Standardized documentation on admission H&P and
progress notes
• Use AHA-approved materials to improve patient
education as well as clear instruction on what to do if
symptoms worsen
• Discharge counseling in 4FLEX and CCU
• Call all patients with CHF Exacerbation as primary
diagnosis within 48-72 hours of discharge to check
on symptoms and ensure they have meds and
appropriate follow-up scheduled
• Post hospital APP CHF Clinic
• Ensure post-hospital appointment listed on
paperwork

• Sample chart review to assess completeness
of discharge med list
• Number of cardiology consults
• Compare readmission rates for patients with
cardiology involvement and those without
• Track all nurse discharge counseling notes
• Balancing measures including patient
satisfaction and impact on other nursing
functions
• The AHA Research Coordinator to track all
CHF patients discharged from the hospital
and records their metrics
• attendance at PH appointments
• phone calls
• number of revisits to ED and readmissions

 Left without Being Seen
Aim

To reduce percentage of patients Left Without Being Seen from Stroger Hospital (5.3% at baseline) by
18% (target 4.3%) by December 2020 and by 20% (target 4.0%) by December 2021.
Plan
• CT Surge Project - Streamline process to
move patient to and from ED CT suite
• Bed Control Huddles - Improve
communication between ED, Bed control,
ODA, EVS, Transportation

Do

•
•

At the time of surge (8 patients waiting for
CT in ED) Radiology Supervisor will be
activated to triage and control CT patient
flow, including opening 2nd floor CT suite
Additional Transporter assigned to second
shift, to match peak ED volume times
Team Members will meet in Bed
Assignment Dept. Mon-Fri at 6pm and
10pm
Team Members will include, Ed
Coordinator/Charge RN, Bed Assignment,
EVS Leader, Transportation Leader
The Bed Control Huddle will address
delays and develop action plans to correct
in real time
