1. Minutes of the November 16, 2017, Budget Committee Meeting
Motion: Ms. Kramer moved to approve the minutes of the November 16, 2017, Budget
Committee Meeting. Ms. Wolff seconded the motion.
Ms. Wolff said that the second sentence of the fifth paragraph on Page 5 of the minutes
should read (corrections in italics):
“…with a recusal by Ms. Wolff due to her involvement with the University of Chicago
Hospital.”
Vote: The motion, including the correction, passed by unanimous voice vote.
2. Victims of Crime Act
Associate Director Givens referred to a memo dated December 13, 2017, regarding
FFY14, FFY15, and FFY16 Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) Plan Adjustments. He
called attention to the charts on Pages 1, 2, and 3 of the memo describing FFY14 and
FFY15 funds recently returned to ICJIA. He also called attention to a supplemental
memo dated December 13, 2017, regarding an Illinois Coalition Against Domestic
Violence (ICADV) designation reduction. He said ICADV had originally reported
$128,575 remained unspent at the end of the grant period of performance for its FFY15
VOCA designation of $4,691,328 for the Services to Victims of Domestic Violence
program. He said that staff had since learned that only $123,367 remained unspent at the

3

 12/13/17 Budget Committee Meeting Minutes, Page 3

end of the performance period, a difference of $5,208. The adjusted total amount of
returned VOCA FFY15 funds was $719,089.
Associate Director Givens then described recommended FFY16 designations resulting
from the VOCA Law Enforcement, Prosecution, and CASA Victim Assistance Program
Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO).
ICJIA Program Supervisor Ron Reichgelt said that the only notable rescission of funds
resulted from staff not being able to negotiate a contract with the Salvation Army. Most
of the other returned funds were a by-product of pre-existing grants ending early in
order to begin the new NOFO-based funding process. He said that the large amount of
funds returned by the ICADV was a result of the ICADV’s sub-grantees not spending
all of their grant funds.
Ms. Hora called attention to the following text in the second paragraph on Page 5 of the
memo: “All activities funded under this grant must fall outside of the normal scope of
law enforcement and prosecution activities. Grant funds may not be used to facilitate
participation by witness/victims in the criminal justice proceedings.” She said that these
activities are exactly what victim/witness staff in prosecutors’ offices do. She said that
the directive was confusing, as was the description of case management under Track
One / Item #2(c) at the bottom of Page 5 of the memo; “Advocacy that includes one or
more of the following… writing victim impact statements…” She said that victim impact
statements represent the most significant point of victims’ participation in the criminal
justice system. She said that victim impact statements facilitate the criminal justice
process and, thus, this directive renders the NOFO internally inconsistent. She also
noted that the NOFO summary did not address victims’ rights.
ICJIA Program Supervisor Ron Reichgelt said that the actual NOFO was in excess of 30
pages and provided much more detail than the summary provided in the memo. He said
that victims’ rights and specific allowable activities were addressed in the NOFO.
Ms. Hora stated that she had not reviewed the NOFO, but said that future NOFOs
should be internally consistent.
Ms. Hora noted that she works with more than 75 law enforcement agencies that would
have been interested in applying for these funds and that efforts should be made to
allocate funds statewide as opposed to concentrating funding in the major urban areas.
Executive Director Maki said that staff do their best to disseminate NOFOs as widely as
possible, but reminded Board members that they should also help in this effort,
particularly if they know of potentially interested applicants.
ICJIA Associate General Counsel Malgorzata Bereziewicz said that great effort was put
into crafting the NOFO so that it properly conveyed what activities were and were not
allowable. Although the NOFO summary may not have accurately captured it, the
NOFO’s language was drafted to convey that funds could not be used for prosecutorial or

4

 12/13/17 Budget Committee Meeting Minutes, Page 4

investigative activities that go beyond victim services. Specific types of advocacy were
identified as intended or required within the scope of the NOFO.
Ms. Hora asked for clarification regarding budgetary line items presented in the Grant
Recommendation Reports. In particular, she asked for clarification of personnel costs
listed in the budget for the recommended grant to the Arlington Heights Police
Department; she wanted to know if the funds would support one or multiple staff
members.
ICJIA Program Supervisor Ron Reichgelt said that in the case of the Arlington Heights
Police Department, the funds would support a contract with a victim services agency and
multiple advocates would be supported.
Ms. Hora said personnel costs should be reasonable and that there should not be great
disparities between salaries for similar positions at different agencies. She said that it
would be helpful if future meeting materials specified details such as how many
individuals the dollar amounts in the personnel line items for recommended designations
would fund.
Associate Director Givens said that ICJIA staff at multiple levels review all funding
requests so that all recommended designations have been vetted by the time they are
presented to the Budget Committee.
Executive Director Maki said that all program costs presented in the designation
recommendations have been heavily vetted.
ICJIA General Counsel Angie Weis said that line-item scrutiny of budget details,
including salaries, is outside of the scope of the Budget Committee.
ICJIA Program Supervisor Ron Reichgelt the Grant Accountability and Transparency Act
has requires staff to present designations for recommendation during the grant
development process, rather than at the end. The figures presented in the memo represent
the amounts requested in the applications and in many cases will be revised downward
before the completion of the grant agreements.
ICJIA General Counsel Angie Weis said that in the future, grant recommendations can
provide the number of full-time-equivalent staff that are intended to be supported by the
figure in the personnel budget line items.
Motion: Ms. Wolff moved to approve the recommended FFY14, FFY15, and FFY16
VOCA plan adjustments. Ms. Dunne seconded the motion. The motion passed by
unanimous voice vote, with a recusal by Ms. Kramer due to her involvement with the
Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office.

Subject:

SFY18 Prescription Pill and Drug Disposal Fund
_____

This memo describes Prescription Pill and Drug Disposal Fund (PPDD) Plan Adjustments for
state fiscal year 2018.
RECOMMENDED DESIGNATION
In order to facilitate the safe disposal of drugs, the Illinois General Assembly passed Public Act
097-0545, which established the Prescription Pill and Drug Disposal Fund, a special fund in the
state treasury. The Act states, “monies in the Fund shall be used for grants by the Illinois
Criminal Justice Information Authority to local law enforcement agencies for the purpose of
facilitating the collection, transportation, and incineration of pharmaceuticals from residential
sources that are collected and transported by law enforcement agencies.”
Medicines are found in nearly every home. These products include over-the-counter and
prescription medications, such as solid pills and capsules, creams, liquids, and aerosols. When
used as directed, these products are generally safe for humans and the environment. However,
unused or unwanted medicine needs to be disposed of properly to help prevent accidental
poisoning, substance abuse, and contamination of water resources.
According to the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, unused or unwanted medicines
should not be flushed down the toilet or poured into the sink. These methods create the potential
for harmful chemicals to end up in our lakes, rivers, streams, and groundwater. In fact, traces of
some medicines have been found in water samples in 30 states, which have been connected to
harmful impacts on localized aquatic ecosystems.
Because the negotiation and execution of 74 grants smaller than $2,000 each would be onerous
for both ICJIA and the recipient agencies, ICJIA asked the Illinois Sheriff’s Association (ISA)
and the Illinois Association of Chief of Police (IACP) to consider procuring the drug disposal
kits with grant funding on behalf of the their member agencies. ISA accepted and has agreed to
make the kits available to ISA and IACP members. Larger drug store chains have made drug
7

 VOCA FFY15 & FFY16

disposal boxes available in more populous areas of the state, but rural areas lack access to these
disposal sites. ISA will prioritize requests from law enforcement agencies in jurisdictions with
less access to commercial disposal sites. ISA will use grant funds to procure the boxes and
arrange for delivery to priority sites. Recipient agencies will agree to follow standard procedures
for the receipt, storage, and disposal of the collected drugs.
ISA will develop a standard certification that recipient agencies must sign to assure the agencies
agree to follow required drug handling, inventory and disposal practices. At a minimum,
recipient agencies must agree:









The recipient will identify two staff members as Drug Disposal Box (DDB)
Controllers.
The DDB may only be opened by the two designated DDB Controllers.
The contents of the DDB must be removed at least monthly.
Contents of the DDB must be inventoried by weight and secured in compliance with
standard department evidence handling procedures.
The contents of the DDB must be disposed of by the two DDB Controllers at a
facility approved by the Illinois EPA.
The two DDB Controllers will obtain a signed and dated receipt for the items
disposed of at the EPA-approved site.
The DDB keys must under the secure control of the sheriff/chief of police or his or
her designee, following procedures controlling access to evidence storage.
The recipient agencies will submit to ISP a monthly standard report totaling the
weight of drugs collected and disposed.

Staff recommends designating $150,000 in SFY18 PPDD funds to the ISA to support this effort.
Staff will be available at the meeting to answer any questions.

RE:

FFY17 Violence Against Women Act Plan Introduction

This memo describes the FFY17 VAWA Plan Introduction.
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT PURPOSE
The S.T.O.P. Violence Against Women Act Formula Grant Program (VAWA), awarded
to states and territories, enhances the capacity of local communities to develop and
strengthen effective law enforcement and prosecution strategies to combat violent crimes
against women and to develop and strengthen victim services in cases involving violent
crimes against women.
VAWA FFY17 INTRODUCTION
The FFY17 VAWA award to Illinois is $5,160,091 with an expiration of June 30, 2019.
After setting aside 10 percent of the award for administrative purposes ($516,009), the
remaining $4,644,082 available for program purposes must be distributed as follows:






25 percent to law enforcement.
25 percent to prosecutors.
30 percent to victim services (of which at least 10 percent must be distributed to
culturally specific community-based organizations).
5 percent to state and local courts.
15 percent to discretionary distribution.

RECOMMENDED DESIGNATIONS
Last year, ICJIA convened the Ad Hoc Victim Service Committee to review past
priorities and define new ones for the use of S.T.O.P. VAWA funds. The committee
recommended using FFY17 – FFY20 VAWA funds to continue to support programs
previously funded through VAWA. The following are continuation designations for
previously funded VAWA programs deemed successful by staff. The designations
recommended in this memo are consistent with the priorities set forth in the VAWA
FFY17 – FFY20 Multi-Year Plan.
Domestic Violence/ Sexual Assault Services
Illinois Coalition Against Domestic Violence and Illinois Coalition Against Sexual
Assault
Historically, ICJIA has designated all of each federal fiscal year’s allocated service
provider funds to the Illinois Coalition Against Domestic Violence and Illinois Coalition
Against Sexual Assault in equal amounts. These funds were then subcontracted by them
to their program agencies for services to underserved areas or victim groups.
Staff recommends continuing to designate service provider funds in this manner and that
designations of FFY17 service provider funds are made in the amounts of $696,613 for
both ICASA and ICADV.
Staff will be available at the meeting to answer any questions.

Program Activities
These funds will be used to support the continuation of 14 satellite offices of sexual assault programs and core
services in two developing sexual assault crisis centers. ICASA has used VAWA funds to support these satellite
programs since FY96 to broaden the availability of sexual assault crisis services throughout the state. The
satellite offices and new rape crisis centers are located in previously unserved geographical areas or
underserved neighborhoods.
Services provided by satellite programs include a minimum of a 24-hour hotline and 24-hour access to
individual medical and criminal justice advocacy. Additionally, the satellite offices provide on-going
counseling, professional training, prevention services, institutional advocacy and information and referral.
Goals
Goals include developing, enlarging, or strengthening victim services programs, including sexual assault,
domestic violence, and dating violence programs, developing or improving delivery of victim services to
underserved populations, providing specialized domestic violence court advocates in courts where a significant

B. Lead Entities
Last year, ICJIA convened the VSAHC to review past priorities and define new ones for the use
of VOCA funds. The committee prioritized strengthening and expansion of core services.
Funding of core services will be processed through a lead entity policy that established by ICJIA
in January 2017. This policy states that lead entities can be used to distribute funds to subgrantees to implement federal- and state-supported programs. When a lead entity is identified by
ICJIA, the entity is responsible for the fiscal oversight and quality assurance of its sub-grants.
Lead entities conduct structured monitoring and provide subject matter expertise and technical
assistance to sub-grantees. ICJIA monitors its grant to a lead entity through periodic progress
reports.
The following designations for three lead entity programs are consistent with the priorities set
forth by the VSAHC.
1. Services to Victims of Domestic Violence
Illinois Coalition Against Domestic Violence (ICADV): ICADV is a statewide network of
service providers that provides direct services to victims to alleviate trauma and suffering
resulting from domestic violence. The program provides counseling, advocacy, outreach
services, training, and other support to victims of domestic violence in general and to child

victims of domestic violence. Staff recommends designating $17,300,000 in FFY16 funds to
ICADV. Please see the attached Grant Recommendation Report for more information.
2. Services to Victims of Sexual Assault
Illinois Coalition Against Sexual Assault (ICASA): ICASA is a statewide network of service
providers that provides direct services to victims to alleviate trauma and suffering resulting
from sexual assault. The program provides counseling, advocacy, outreach services, training,
and other support services to victims of sexual assault in general and to underserved sexual
assault victim populations. Staff recommends designating $16,300,000 in FFY16 funds to
ICASA. Please see the attached Grant Recommendation Report for more information.
3. Child Advocacy Center Services
Children’s Advocacy Centers of Illinois (CACI): CACI is a statewide association of child
advocacy centers that provides direct services to child victims to alleviate trauma and
suffering resulting from child abuse. Staff recommends designating $7.1 million in FFY16
funds to CACI. Please see the attached Grant Recommendation Report for more information.
C. Trauma Recovery Center Program
The purpose of the Trauma Recovery Center (TRC) Program is to support comprehensive direct
services for historically underserved or marginalized victims of violent crime and their families
through implementation of a TRC model. This model borrows greatly from the University of
California-San Francisco’s TRC model.
This TRC model addresses both the psychological and tangible needs of violent crime victims
and their families, particularly those in underserved groups, through coordinated and
comprehensive clinical case management, including outreach and services and the provision of
trauma-informed, evidence-based mental health services.
In keeping with the priorities identified by the VSAHC, staff recommends FFY16 funds to the
entities described in the table below to develop and implement the TRC program for 15 months.
Three months will be intended for development of mandatory protocols and twelve months for
program direct services. Please see the attached Grant Recommendation Report for more
information.

Notice of Funding Opportunity

Program Description
Illinois, and other states that are not in substantial compliance with the Sex Offender Registration and
Notification Act (SORNA), lose a portion of their annual Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) award. These
“penalty” funds are then returned to the state through the SORNA program. SORNA funds may only be used to
maintain or enhance state compliance with the SORNA Act. This Notice of Funding Opportunity for SORNA
penalty funds was offered to support the ISP Sex Offender Registration Unit in enhancing public safety and
move Illinois closer to federal compliance with the Act through the purchase of equipment that will allows sex
offender documents to be electronically submitted to Illinois State Police (ISP). Approximately 30 Livescan
machines will be purchased with these funds.
Program Activities
The Illinois State Police used FFY12 SORNA funds to purchase an electronic filing system that allowed
document scanning, storage, and sharing of registrant files. Scanned documents include, but are not limited to,
notification/registration forms, any correspondence to and from the offender, and court documents. FFY15
SORNA funds were used to procure a high capacity server dedicated to storage of Sex Offender Registration
Unit documents. With adequate server capacity, ISP then used FFY16 funds for staff overtime to digitally scan
existing paper documents, help eliminate the backlog of paper records, and move toward more efficient
paperless submission, storage, and dissemination of sex offender records.
Goals
The goal of this funding opportunity is to enable the ISP Sex Offender Registration Unit to enhance public
safety with conversion to an all-electronic records system that will allow more efficient sex offender record
management and move Illinois closer to federal SORNA compliance.
Priorities
Electronic submission, storage, and dissemination of sex offender registration documents is a SORNA funding
priority.

Description
The Act provides a comprehensive set of minimum
standards for sex offender registration and notification in
the United States. The Act aims to close potential gaps and
loopholes that existed under prior law and generally
strengthens the nationwide network of sex offender
registration and notification programs.
Within a specified timeframe, each jurisdiction is required
to comply with the federal standards outlined in the Sex
Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA).
Jurisdictions include all 50 states, the District of Columbia,
the principal U.S. territories, and federally recognized
Indian tribes
