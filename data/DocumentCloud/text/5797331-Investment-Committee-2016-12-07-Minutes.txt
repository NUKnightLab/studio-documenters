Re: Adoption of Actuarial Assumptions for purposes of determining funding level and
mandatory employee contributions for Component I of the Retirement System
Resolution Moved By: Trustee Naglick – Supported By: Trustee Szymanski
WHEREAS, the Board of Trustees of the General Retirement System of the City of
Detroit is vested with the authority and fiduciary responsibility for the administration,
management, and operation of the Retirement System, and
WHEREAS, the provisions of the plan are subject to the applicable provisions of the
Internal Revenue Code, applicable state law, the applicable charter and ordinance
provisions of the City of Detroit and the Combined Plan for the General Retirement
System, and
WHEREAS, Section 9.5 of the Combined Plan titled “Fiscal Responsibility: Increased
Funding Obligations and Benefit Reductions,” provides generally that to “safeguard the
long-term actuarial and financial integrity of the Retirement System” in the event the
funding level of Component I of the Retirement System projected over a five-year period
falls below specified targets, the Board is required to take established remedial actions,
and
WHEREAS, Section 9.5(3) further provides that “the actuarial accrued liability of
Component I shall be calculated by the Plan’s Actuary utilizing an interest rate
assumption of six and three-quarters percent (6.75%) and other reasonable
assumptions as directed by the Board upon the recommendation of the Investment
Committee” (emphasis added), and

MEETING NO. 4171
DECEMBER 7, 2016

Re: Adoption of Actuarial Assumptions for purposes of determining funding level and
mandatory employee contributions for Component I of the Retirement System – (con’t)
WHEREAS, the Retirement System’s actuary, Gabriel Roeder Smith & Company, in its
initial June 30, 2014 Annual Actuarial Valuation of Component I, has raised certain
questions and requested clarification/confirmation from the Board and the Retirement
System’s Investment Committee with respect to the assumptions to be utilized for the
implementation of Section 9.5 and performance of the required five-year projection, and
WHEREAS, the Board has discussed this matter amongst the Board members, and
with its Actuary and General Counsel; THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED, that upon recommendation of the Retirement System’s Investment
Committee, the following guidelines are hereby adopted by the Board and shall be
utilized by the actuary in completing the five-year projections as required in Section 9.5
of the Combined Plan:
1. The five-year projections should be based on the general valuation assumptions
as previously adopted by the Board (e.g., inflation, mortality, retirement,
withdrawal, etc.).

2. Section 9.5(1) provides that Variable Pension Improvement Factor (“VPIF”)
benefits will only be granted in the event the plan is projected to be over 100%
funded. It is the considered opinion of the Board that the mandatory employee
contributions as set forth in the plan based upon the five-year projections
required by Section 9.5 are intended to fund base benefits in the normal course
and not VPIF benefits. Accordingly, it is the funding policy of the Board to not
include any projected future VPIF benefits in the five-year projection calculations.
However, in the future and to the extent that VPIF benefits have been granted to
retirees at the time of the five-year projection, that Actuary shall assume
continuation of those previously granted VPIF benefits except as otherwise
provided in Section 9.5(2) of the Combined Plan. For purposes of completing the

five-year projection in any given year, an initial projection is to be completed
demonstrating the effect of an award of the VPIF benefit to qualified retirees in
the following Plan Year. If the Plan continues to be funded at a level greater than
100%, the VPIF may be awarded by the Board and IC in accordance with the
Plan provisions. In the event the funding level in the initial projection is less than
100%, a second projection shall be performed to verify if any of the remedial
measures required under Section 9.5 are necessary.
3. Transition Costs should not include an assumption of future VPIF benefits.
Since there is a separate funding source established in the Combined Plan for
payment of Transition costs through 2023 [Section E-16(c)], Transition Costs
- 11 -

 GENERAL RETIREMENT SYSTEM
MEETING NO. 4171
CITY OF DETROIT
DECEMBER 7, 2016
should be excluded from the Section 9.5 tests until fiscal year 2024. The
Transition Costs shall be determined as of July 1, 2014 (without an assumption
for payment of future VPIF benefits and financing of the Transition costs shall be
calculated based upon a level dollar amortization of the Initial Transition Cost
over a 9-year fixed amortization period and the Retirement System’s Investment
Return Assumption of 6.75%.
4. Component II ASF balances are assumed to be withdrawn as a level dollar
amount over the next 10 years, however voluntary employee contributions into
the Component I Annuity Savings Fund shall be assumed to continue at the
historical levels as previously contributed to the Component II ASF. For
Transition Funding purposes, an appropriate arbitrage of the difference between
the assumed rate of investment return of 6.75% and the maximum interest rate
that can be credited to the ASF Accounts of 5.25% should be used for both the
Component I and Component II ASF Accounts.
5. The Component I assets shall include the Rate Stabilization Fund to the extent
the plan is less than 100% funded.
6. The Annual Actuarial Valuation for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2015 shall
generate the first five-year projection. Upon receipt of the June 30, 2015
valuation, a determination shall be made whether any remedial action is required.
In the event remedial action is required, such remedial action shall be effective
July 1, 2017 [Section 9.5(1)].
7. The funding value of plan assets for purposes of Section 9.5 testing of the
Component I plan funding level would otherwise be based upon a three (3) year
smoothing method wherein the assumed investment income of 6.75% will be
recognized fully each year and the differences between actual and assumed
investment income shall be phased in over a closed three (3) year period. The
Actuary has opined that since the projection period is for a five (5) year period,
the use of a three (3) year smoothing period is of no consequence and would
result in an asset value that is not materially different than projecting the current
market value of assets out five (5) years at the assumed rate of return of 6.75%.
According the projection shall utilize the market value of the portfolio using the
6.75% rate of return. – [Section 9.5(3)].
8. The forgoing assumptions shall be utilized for both the 100% projection test in
Section 9.5(1) and the 80% projection test in Section 9.5(2).
9. The required actions set for in Section 9.5(2), if any, shall be reflected in the
projections by the addition of each item in the order listed, until the appropriate
threshold is reached. Illustrated as follows:
-

i. Perform the first projection ignoring all the 9.5(2) actions. If
the projected funded status was less than 80%, then the
- 12 -

 GENERAL RETIREMENT SYSTEM
MEETING NO. 4171
CITY OF DETROIT
DECEMBER 7, 2016
Actuary is to re-perform the projection reflecting the action in
9.5(2)(a). If the projection results in a funding level that is still
below 80%, the projection is to be re-performed reflecting the
action in 9.5(2)(b); and so on. Once the 80% threshold is met,
such projection would reflect the required actions under
Section 9.5(2) that are to be taken.
FURTHER RESOLVED, that a copy of this resolution be provided to the GRS
Investment Committee with a request that the Committee make formal recommendation
to the Board of the adoption of the assumptions and guidelines provided herein, and
FURTHER RESOLVED, that a copy of this resolution be maintained in the Retirement
System records, and a copy be provided to the Board’s Actuary and Auditor.
