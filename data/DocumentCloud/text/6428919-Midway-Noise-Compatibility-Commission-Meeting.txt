There was an average of 593 operations per day with 61 of those occurring at
night. Southwest Airlines had the highest operations with an average of 415
operations per day with 47 of those occurring at night. The B737 used almost
exclusively by Southwest and was the most used aircraft with an average of 415
operations per day. General Aviation followed with 127 operations per day 7 of
which were helicopters.
In response to Chairman Baliga’s question, Mr. Jackson stated that General
Aviation includes both corporate and owner operated aircraft.
Permanent Noise Monitor Locations
The report indicates the addresses of the 13 permanent noise monitor locations
near the airport as reflected in relation to the Midway 2018 Noise Contour. The
report shows the results for January 2016 through March 2016 with quarterly
breakdowns and a 12 month rolling average. The 1st quarter 2016 results are
compared to those of the 1st quarter 2015. Site 314 at 39th and Albany is located
directly between the newly implemented flight procedures. The monitor was
installed late last summer and now has almost three full quarters of data showing
the noise level to be in the low sixties.
Noise Hotline Report
The total number of complaints for the 1st quarter was 18,703 of which 100 were
at night. The highest number of complaints came from Burbank with 16,782 the
majority of which came from one individual. Mr. Jackson stated that the reason
the Burbank complaints are higher is due to the FAA change in flight procedures
which increased 22L arrivals and departures resulting in flights turning directly
over the city. Mayor Klein pointed out that of all 13 monitors the statistics
indicate that monitor 309 in Burbank went up the most, 4.2 decibels since the last
quarter of 2015. He stated that not only do those changes impact the residents
but are also having a detrimental impact on the schools. Chairman Baliga asked
if the new procedures are mandated and Mr. Jackson stated that they are not
and that it is up to the tower and the airlines to determine the usage of those
changes. Chairman Baliga stated that the FAA should be consulted to see if a
decrease in the current use patterns can be considered. Mr. Lihosit asked if
additional Burbank schools were being considered for sound insulation and Mr.
Frame stated that they did not meet the 60 DNL level requirements.
