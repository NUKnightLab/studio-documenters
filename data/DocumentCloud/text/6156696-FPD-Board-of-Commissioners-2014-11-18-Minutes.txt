PROPOSED RESOLUTION
Sponsored by: LARRY SUFFREDIN, County Commissioner
A Resolution Opposing the United States Army Corps of Engineers Proposed Use of the Fullerton Woods

WHEREAS, in August of 2013, the United States Army Corps of Engineers (“U.S. Army Corps”) issued an
Integrated Feasibility Report and Environmental Assessment for the Upper Des Plaines River and Tributaries of
Illinois and Wisconsin (the “Report”);
WHEREAS, the Report sought to create a comprehensive plan for addressing flooding and stormwater along the
Des Plaines River; and
WHEREAS, the Report proposed a variety of remediation measures along the Des Plaines river, including the
creation of a reservoir within the Aptakisic Creek watershed, in Lake County, Illinois, near the Village of Buffalo
Grove; and
WHEREAS, in October, 2013, the Village of Buffalo Grove passed a resolution opposing the siting of the reservoir
at Aptakisic Creek; and
WHEREAS, the U.S. Army Corps issued a “Documentation of Changes to the Draft Integrated Feasibility Report
and Environmental Assessment” (the “Documentation of Changes”) in response to the Village of Buffalo Grove’s
resolution;
WHEREAS, the Documentation of Changes removed the proposal for a reservoir within the Aptakisic Creek
watershed and proposed the creation of two reservoirs at Fullerton Woods and the Harry Semrow Driving Range
within the Forest Preserve District of Cook County; and
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of the Forest Preserve District of Cook County were never presented
with and have not ruled upon the proposal within the Documentation of Changes;
WHEREAS, the proposed creation of the reservoirs is not supported as a land use under law and is against the
mission and land use policies of the Forest Preserve District of Cook County; and
NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that the Real Estate Committee of the Forest Preserve District of Cook
County Board of Commissioners convene a public hearing to discuss the proposed creation of reservoirs at
Fullerton Woods and the Harry Semrow Driving Range; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Superintendent of the Forest Preserve District of Cook County, and/or

sewer and outfall structure to the North Branch Chicago River. The storm sewer is part of a storm water relief
program that also includes a detention basin and bioinfiltration facility on other village property. The sewer will
capture storm water runoff to relieve flooding and to reduce the combined sewer overflow discharge. The request
also includes licensing the existing combined sewer overflow structure for which no license or agreement is known.
The Village will also construct a new ADA crosswalk on Caldwell Avenue at Cleveland Street with push button
activated flashers, and a new paved trail connection, along the route of the new storm sewer, to the existing North

BOARD AGENDA

Concurrences:
The Chief Financial Officer and Chief Attorney have approved this item.
Summary: The Forest Preserve District of Cook County (the “Preserves”) has received a grant award from the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (“USFWS”) to support restoration activities at Wentworth Woods in Calumet City,
Illinois. These USFWS grant funds are provided through the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (“GLRI”). This
project will enable the Preserves to work with an experienced ecological contractor to manage invasive species and
thin woody vegetation throughout Wentworth Woods. Active restoration will improve the ecological health of this
site and promote the growth of native ground-layer vegetation that is currently at great risk of decreased diversity
and site extirpation due to alien competition and low light levels. Wentworth Woods retains the original dune and
swale topography that once characterized most of the Calumet Region and demonstrates a strong potential for
ecological restoration.
Total funding amount is $86,000.00, with $43,000.00 being provided as match by the Preserves.
