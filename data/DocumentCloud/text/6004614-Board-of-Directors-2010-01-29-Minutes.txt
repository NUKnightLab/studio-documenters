Report from Chairman of the Board
A.

Board Education – Performance Improvement Overview
William T. Foley, Chief Executive Officer of the Cook County Health and Hospitals System, introduced
the item by stating that the Office of Performance Improvement was created (on a non-permanent basis)
in order to improve operations and quality through the coordination of the consultants currently working
for the System. Additionally, he stated that the overview provided by Jeanene Johnson, Director of the
Office of Performance Improvement, will provide further insight into how it ties into the overall
performance improvement plan implementation for the System.
Ms. Johnson presented the overview (Attachment #1). The Board reviewed and discussed the
information. Topics discussed included those regarding dashboards, information-sharing, processbuilding and implementation. Additionally, discussion took place on the performance improvement
benefit summary provided as part of the information.
With regard to information-sharing and dashboards, Director O’Donnell inquired whether this
information is being distributed beyond the Board and top leadership. Mr. Foley responded
affirmatively; he stated that it is being driven down through all levels of management. He noted the
importance of this, because the dashboard is a tool to hold people accountable for timely information and
performance. With regard to Director Greenspan’s inquiry of whether the dashboard can evolve into a
tool that can be widely distributed and be useful to all System employees, Ms. Johnson responded that
she agrees that his suggestion is important and should be a goal.

Report from Chairman of the Board
A.

Board Education – Performance Improvement Overview (continued)
Discussion took place on the subject of the Quality and Patient Safety Committee, and how it uses
performance improvement information for quality improvement throughout the System. Mr. Foley
stated that a report can be given on the Committee’s work with regard to this subject, and noted that they
are structuring quality and patient safety as a System function. They have begun the recruitment efforts
for a System Director of Quality and Patient Safety that will report to Dr. Terry Mason, System Chief
Medical Officer. He added that the other component of this is a System risk management function, and
noted that they are currently interviewing final candidates for this function.

IV.

Report from Chief Executive Officer
Update on System Relief Efforts for Haiti
Mr. Foley provided an update on County and System activities relating to relief efforts for Haiti, following the
devastating earthquake that occurred on January 12, 2010. He stated that the System is working closely with
the County. The County has made commitments with regard to supplies, equipment and staff; System
management agreed to support these efforts by funding up to ten employees up to ten days each to go to Haiti
to help with relief efforts. It is his understanding that the unions are paying for the travel expenses. He noted
that System staffing needs were key to the discussions on the subject; additional personnel may be granted
leave to go, but it must be approved by the appropriate management based on staffing coverage needs here.
He added that this travel must be through a recognized relief effort, and a waiver of liability must be signed
for those traveling.
Leslie Curtis, Midwest Director of the National Nurses Organizing Committee, provided additional
information on these efforts coordinated through the unions. She stated that they are required to work with a
federal government agency, and they are awaiting System approval now that the required documentation has
been submitted. Once they receive System approval, tickets will be purchased and coordination will take
place with the U.S. Navy to get the individual(s) on the U.S.S. Comfort. She added that there are
immunization requirements.
Emilie Junge, representing the Doctors Council SEIU, stated that with regard to physician participation in
these efforts, they are working with the IMC (International Medical Corps), and are coordinating for
physicians at both Rush and John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County.
Year-End Revenue Summary
Mr. Ayres presented a year-end revenue summary (Attachment #2), and provided an overview of the
information.
Chairman Batts inquired regarding the number of patients being treated. He noted that System revenue cycle
activities have improved, and asked whether more patients are being treated as a result of these efficiencies.
Mr. Ayres responded that the year-end financials are expected to be presented at the next Finance Committee
meeting; this should provide the answer to Chairman Batts’ question.
Dr. Mason noted that at a recent medical staff meeting for John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County, data
was presented that indicates admissions and emergency room visits trending up. Additionally, Dr. Enrique
Martinez, Chief Medical Officer of the Ambulatory and Community Health Network of Cook County
(ACHN), stated that until 2006, ACHN clinics had 750,000 visits per year. Then, as a result of the budget
cuts in 2007, visits in 2007 and 2008 decreased to 600,000. In 2009, the visits increased to approximately
640,000; this year they expect the visits to increase to approximately 670,000 or more.

Report from Chief Executive Officer (continued)
Miscellaneous
Mr. Foley provided copies of a confidentiality notice, and asked Elizabeth Reidy, System General Counsel, to
explain the purpose of the notice.
Ms. Reidy stated that, as the System is unique as a public body because it has protected health information
included in some of its meetings, including those of the Quality and Patient Safety Committee, it was deemed
prudent to issue a confidentiality notice as an educational tool for those individuals who are permitted to
remain present during closed session meetings, as a reminder that certain information is required to be kept
confidential.
A. FY2010 System Operational Plan
Dr. Anthony Tedeschi, Interim Chief Operating Officer for the Cook County Health and Hospitals System,
presented the FY2010 System Operational Plan (Attachment #3). He stated that the operations plan is a
series of eighty-seven goals within operations for this fiscal year. He noted that the performance
improvement efforts outlined by Ms. Johnson link into this plan, and the leadership goals presented by Mr.
Foley are also incorporated.
The Board reviewed the information. Dr. Tedeschi stated that monthly updates on the plan will be
provided to the Board, and there will be opportunities to periodically present detailed information on
completed goals, or to provide updates on those goals that may be more complex or problematic in nature.
B. System Leadership Goals
Mr. Foley presented the goals for System leadership for this next year (Attachment #4), and highlighted
several areas of interest.
Director Lyne noted that medical education relationships should be included in the list of goals. Mr.
Foley agreed, and stated that it would be included.
C. Strategic Plan Update
Mr. Foley provided an update on strategic planning, and provided a detailed list of tasks (Attachment #5)
expected to be accomplished over the next few months, which will lead to a recommendation of a
strategic plan in June. He noted that within the minutes of the Finance Committee there is a
recommendation for an extension of the contract with Integrated Clinical Solutions (ICS), which will
allow for the facilitation and support of strategic planning efforts.
Mr. Foley stated that John Abendshien of ICS will present a strategic plan update at the Board’s next
meeting in February. Additionally, with regard to the Board’s meeting in March, he is recommending that
the meeting be abbreviated, and followed by a Strategic Planning retreat.
Director Lyne requested additional information on efforts towards productivity measurement and
improvement. Mr. Foley noted that there are several ongoing activities relating to this, such as Ms.
Johnson’s work on performance improvement and the management assessment process. Ms. Johnson
stated that over the next month, she expects to have a first-cut of a dashboard with this type of
information.

Strategic Plan Update (continued)
Mr. Foley stated that the productivity piece is a key component in the next phase of performance
improvement. He provided a brief update on the status, stating that three vendors responded to the
Request for Proposals.
Additionally with regard to productivity, Dr. Tedeschi noted that there has been a transformation of work
at Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County, with the assistance of its Chief Operating Officer Sylvia Edwards.
There have been significant improvements in productivity; he stated that he can provide an update on this
subject to the Board at a future meeting.
Director Greenspan inquired regarding the subject of data relating to full-time equivalent employees
(FTEs) per adjusted occupied bed. Michael Ayres, Chief Financial Officer of the Cook County Health
and Hospitals System, stated that the reports with this information will be produced by next month on an
operating unit level.
Parallel with the work being done for the strategic plan, Mr. Foley presented information on a proposal for
a joint project with the University of Chicago Medical Center (UCMC) and Provident Hospital of Cook
County (Attachment #6). He emphasized that, at this point, this is only relating to an assessment and
exploration of the feasibility of such an arrangement. He expects to have an item on the next Finance
Committee agenda relating to this, with a recommendation to jointly fund with UCMC an assessment of a
possible collaboration. He stated that there were six firms selected for this assessment, and noted that the
System and UCMC did not want to consider any firms with existing ties to either entity. A joint team
from each organization evaluated the firms and recommended Health Strategies & Solutions for the
assessment.

 Cook County Health and Hospital Systems
Year-End Revenue Summary
The Cook County Office of the Comptroller released the unaudited Revenue Report for
the 12 Months Ended November 30, 2009 summarizing revenues received during the
year in the Revenue Fund by the County from various sources. In summary, the report
identified that the County had a positive revenue variance of $253.9 million. Of that,
$231.3 million had been received above budgeted reimbursement from the Hospitals
System through Medicaid supplemental payments ($15.7 million) and the
Disproportionate Share Funds ($215.6 million). The county's general fund had
unfavorable variances of $167.4 million of which $37.1 million was related to the Health
System's Patient Fees. The total positive variances on revenues offset the negative
variances by $86.5 million.
The following table shows the impact of each of the Hospital Systems revenue categories
compared to their budget.

The favorable variances for Medicaid IGT and disproportionate share were a result of
negotiations with Medicaid concerning prior year reimbursements and changes in current
year payments. Part of the settlement for the increase in disproportionate share was a
recoupment of prior period payments totaling $58 million. These funds were withheld
from current 2009 payments. By year-end, the state had withheld $53.1 million. Had the
recoupment not been removed from the current year payments, patient fees would have
totaled $326.9 million resulting in a $16 million positive variance.
Also as part of the settlement with Medicaid the hospital had a reduction in current year
payment rates. We estimate that had the reduction not occurred the system would have
received approximately $96.4 million more revenue. In total, as shown in the table
below, if the Health System had not been subject to the recoupment and a reduction in
rates, patient fees would have approached $423.3 million for a $112.4 million positive
variance.

 The office of the Comptroller also released the November 30 Statement of
Appropriations, Expenditures, Encumbrances and Unencumbered Balances. As of
November 30, 2009, the health fund had adjusted appropriations for the year of $966.9
million. As of November 30, total expenditures and encumbrances were $924.6 million
or 95.6% of the budget for savings of $42.2 million.
In conclusion, the Cook County Health and Hospital Systems contributed $194.3million
in additional resources and underspending of its budget by $42.3 million for a total
positive contribution to Cook County of approximately $236.5 million.

 Cook County Health and Hospitals System Operations Plan
FY 2010 (December 2009-November 2010)
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
I.

INTRODUCTION

The Cook County Health and Hospitals System (“CCHHS”) is one of the largest and most
complex public health systems in the United States. The System is comprised of Stroger
Hospital, Provident Hospital, Oak Forest Hospital, the Ambulatory Community Health Network
(“ACHN”), the CORE Center, the Cook County Department of Public Health, and Cermak
Health Services. The governance structure of the current System was altered in 2008 in response
to a recognized need to significantly improve CCHHS performance in quality, financial
performance, efficiency, and service.
As the board approaches its second anniversary the organization has seen much change in its
efforts to implement improvements. These improvements have included a strong focus on
enhancing financial performance resulting in over $350M of combined efficiency improvements
and revenue enhancements. The financial improvements resulted in a 19% reduction in the
required County tax subsidy from FY09 to our current budget for FY10. Community engagement
has been another priority for the System and our strategic plan “Vision 2015” has been shared in
14 town hall meetings and with over 1,500 residents during the past year. This engagement and
the resulting feedback have enabled CCHHS to refine our strategic plan in partnership with our
communities. Much of the work of the last two years has been in service of laying a foundation
that includes experienced senior leadership and an infrastructure of processes and systems to
build upon. Through these focused improvement efforts, the System has positioned itself well for
achieving our vision:
“In support of its public health mission, CCHHS will be recognized locally, regionally,
and nationally – and by patients and employees – as a progressively evolving model for
an accessible, integrated, patient-centered, and fiscally-responsible healthcare system
focused on assuring high-quality care and improving the health of the residents of Cook
County.”

That being said, the purpose of this communication is to present an Operations Plan and series of
recommendations for FY10 that, upon successful implementation, best position CCHHS as a
quality healthcare organization ensuring a successful and sustainable future.
This year’s Operations Plan is intended to be an accountability tool that will drive both targeted
improvements as well as push organizational learning. The plan has been created based on the

Page 57 of 109

 input of both System and local site management. It is developed to support many of the
previously identified organizational goals as well as the FY10 budget.
The nine strategic levers for the coming year that are essential to CCHHS achieving its potential
as an organization are: 1) leadership (Board, Medical Staff and Hospital Management); 2)
financial performance; 3) efficiency; 4) quality; 5) service/satisfaction; 6) workforce excellence;
7) market share; 8) physician partnership; and 9) strategic planning. The attached Operations
Plan is outlined in a stoplight format with specific goals, measures, accountable parties, and
timelines. Each month an updated report will be generated and shared with management and the
board. As the format is clearly “operations” by design, management will share a few specific
successes and challenges each month and provide the opportunity to answer specific questions.
The remainder of the Executive Summary shares a high level overview of each of the levers.
These are color coded within the Stoplight Report.
II.

LEADERSHIP

Building a strong leadership team continues to be a major focus for FY10. Effective leadership
at all levels of CCHHS (Board, Medical Staff and Management) is the key for developing a
sustainable culture of clinical quality, patient service, and financial performance.
Major leadership initiatives for the coming year are focused on building an infrastructure of
training, accountability, education and communication that creates sustainable systems in support
of implementing the strategic plan. The leadership goals include a focus on developing a plan
and function that integrates diversity within CCHHS. Goals 1-7 represent leadership initiatives
for FY10.

III.

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

In FY10, CCHHS has budgeted a 19% reduction in our year-to-year County tax subsidy. We
have aligned upon a $60M improvement secondary to the work force rebalancing plan as well as
a $20M improvement due to implementation of the group purchasing agreement. A major focus
of this year’s Operations Plan is achieving the FY10 budgeted cost savings.
Major financial performance initiatives for FY10 include cost reduction initiatives, continued
revenue cycle performance improvement as well as developing and implementing plans in key
areas of infrastructure (IT strategic plan, ERP implementation, risk management, corporate
compliance, and internal audit). Additionally, the FY10 plan includes developing and
implementing several goals related to our physician practices. Goals 8-23 represent financial
performance initiatives for FY10.

IV.

EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENTS

Significant opportunity to improve efficiency exists throughout CCHHS. Often these
opportunities show up as access issues or as cost opportunities. A major focus of this year’s

2 of 5
Page 58 of 109

 Operations Plan is addressing “flow” in key areas that should result in improvements in access,
satisfaction, and productivity.
Focused goals for improving efficiency in FY10 include improving flow-thru within the Stroger
specialty clinics, Stroger OR, and system wide colonoscopy services. Additional goals focused
on improving flow include completing the development of an internal HR and purchasing
function within CCHHS. Goals 24-35 represent efficiency initiatives for FY10.

V.

QUALITY

Improving quality within CCHHS is perhaps the single most important lever in moving the
System toward achieving its vision and mission. Quality improvement efforts will positively
impact patient satisfaction, efficiency, and financial performance serving to align the overall
efforts within the System.
In the coming year, quality goals will include focusing on meeting accreditation requirements,
spreading a performance improvement technology (PDSA) within the organization and sharing
learning, achieving “best in class” performance in focused clinical areas (OB, Surgical Services,
and ED/Trauma Services) as well as in focused core measures (CHF, CAP). Goals 36-50
represent quality initiatives for FY10.

VI.

SERVICE AND SATISFACTION

Organizational efforts to improve patient satisfaction at CCHHS are essential to the successful
implementation of the System strategic plan. Building a culture of service will require the
organization to fundamentally shift its approach to many patient interactions.
The major service goals for FY10 include implementing a program that improves patient
satisfaction scores at each site, addresses several opportunities at Stroger Hospital (parking,
maternal child services and improving services for Latino patients), and redesigns key interface
processes to better serve our patients (registration, centralized scheduling and website). These
service-based goals 51-58 are represented in the stoplight report.

VII.

WORK FORCE EXCELLENCE

During the next 12 months, the CCHHS workforce will continue to undergo substantial change
that is all in service of supporting the organizational turnaround and the implementation of the
strategic plan. Ultimately, the organization’s success relies upon the development and
engagement of our key asset, our employees. Upon completion of the Phase 2 reductions,
CCHHS will conduct an externally led assessment of the work force satisfaction, identify
opportunities for improving the employee experience, design an intervention/plan, and
implement the plan. The process will be led by team consisting of front line staff from each site.

3 of 5
Page 59 of 109

 FY10 goals 59-66 will include addressing a number of issues impacting the workforce
experience including implementing the dual employment policy, communicating the strategic
plan, redesigning the employee performance review system, and addressing the current FMLA
practices.

VIII. MARKET SHARE
One of the most significant challenges for CCHHS is improving market share within both Oak
Forest Hospital and Provident Hospital. Currently, each site is significantly underutilized and is
not being optimally used by the communities. Targeted growth strategies for each site will be
developed and assessed for implementation potential. Certainly, there is clear recognition that the
strategic plan will impact these growth strategies.
For FY10 goals to grow market share at Oak Forest Hospital and Provident Hospital are outlined
as 67-72 and are focused on short term (less than one year) implementation timeframes. At Oak
Forest Hospital these will include assessing the potential of developing a 24-hour observation
unit for the ED, opening a sleep studies center, and developing key partnerships to build the
rehabilitative services business. At Provident Hospital, goals will include assessing the potential
for developing a free standing urgent care center, a geriatric unit, and a hospice unit.

IX.

PHYSICIAN PARTNERSHIPS

CCHHS has a long-standing reputation for the strength of its partnerships with physicians. The
FY10 Operations Plan includes several goals aimed at realigning System expectations with
CCHHS physicians. Implementing these goals will result in a model that more closely
approximates those seen in other health systems. In general, our physicians will be asked to shift
a greater percentage of their employment time to direct clinical care enabling us to better serve
our patients’ needs. Changing the exiting model will be difficult yet necessary to assure that
CCHHS is able to implement the strategic plan.
Additionally, the physician partnership goals will focus on consolidating leadership in critical
service lines and implementing pilots with area federally qualified health centers (FQHCs). The
FQHC pilots provide a platform to allow CCHHS to assess the opportunity to build business
through these strategic alliances. Finally, a focused effort to provide funding for physician
leadership and development will be created to assure that CCHHS is developing our future
physician leaders.

Specific FY10 goals 73-77 include the redesign of the physician model, pilot programs within
ACHN and local FQHCs, and physician leadership education
X.

STRATEGIC PLANNING

The operations plan is a one-year plan designed to drive strategy and tactics in support of the
CCHHS Strategic Plan. This year’s plan includes elements that are tightly linked to the strategic

4 of 5
Page 60 of 109

 planning process such as assessing and providing recommendations for future services at
Provident Hospital and Oak Forest Hospital. The goals for FY10 also include completing
assessments and recommendations for key service lines/services including the regional health
centers, Maternal Child Health Services, ED/Trauma Services, and Surgical Services. A focused
review of the opportunity to partner with University of Chicago at Provident Hospital is included
as well.
The strategic planning goals that are included within the FY10 Operations Plan are included as
78-87 in the Operations Stoplight Report.
XI.

SUMMARY

The Operations Plan and recommendations being presented provide the organization a road map
positioning it for a successful and sustainable future. The plan builds upon the strong
organizational work of the past two years and best positions the organization for a successful and
sustainable future. The nine strategic levers focus on a balanced approach to improving
organizational performance. The Operations Stoplight Report that accompanies the Executive
Summary will serve as a tracking tool to monitor performance and manage accountability.

Five of the six firms responded. Two firms were eliminated, one because the firm
proposed to partner with a group that been earlier eliminated by potential conflicts
and the other because its proposed prices were more than an order of magnitude
greater than the next highest proposal. The other three firms were invited to present to
a group of managers from each institution.
The reviewing group recommended Health Strategies & Solutions (HS&S). HS&S is
Philadelphia-based but has Chicago market experience. HS&S had the lowest price of
the three presenting firms, but also reflected substantial substantive advantages
including the fact their team has a long history of working together, their team is small
and dominated by firm principals, they have specific experience working on similar
projects, and their style seemed most suited to bring the two parties to a common
understanding of the issues around a potential partnership.

Conversation around the specifics of contracting is now under way. The general
approach anticipated is for UCMC to contract with HS&S and CCHHS to make an
agreement with UCMC to reimburse half of the costs. The agreement with UCMC will
be brought to the Finance Committee on February 19 and the Board on February 26.
The proposed costs for the project were $140K-160K for Phase 1 and a similar amount for
Phase 2.
The contract will be managed by a small Joint Steering Committee and Mike Koetting
will provide lead staffing for the project. Current anticipation is for a brief update at the
February Board meeting and a much more substantial discussion in March, prior to the
conclusion of Phase 1.

I IS THIS CONTRACT

Justification:
This project will provide a new facility to combine and house the Reception Classification Diagnostic Center which
processes admissions into the Department of Corrections (DOC), Cermak Health Services of Cook County and the
Residential Treatment Unit. The program includes new intake, holding, and processing areas, clinics, medical
services and associated administrative functions, dormitories and auxiliary dormitory functions. In recent years, this
system has had to respond to the demands of increasing numbers of inmate admissions and mental health evaluations
and treatment. The existing RCDC and RTU facilities can no longer accommodate the volume of admissions,
screenings and care required. The facilities are overcrowded, basic amenities are inadequate, building systems are
outdated and in some cases non-functional.
The new facility will meet current 'Essential Standards" set by the National Commission on Correctional Health Care
and the American Correctional Association and is required for maintaining accreditation and will provide for an
efficient and orderly intake process including, screening and provision of care.
This project was included in the 2009 Capital Improvement Program projects approved by the Board of
Commissioners on April 2,2009.
