Statement by the Board of Review to the Cook County Finance Committee
Regarding Fiscal Year 2013 Budget
Hearing Date: October 24, 2012

Good morning Chairman Daley and members of the Finance Committee. For the record,
my name is Michael Cabonargi and I am the Chairman of the Cook County Board of Review. I
am joined today by Commissioner Dan Patlak. We want to thank you for the opportunity to
speak on behalf of the Board of Review regarding our 2013 Budget. To start, I want to say we
understand the dif?cult economic reality faced by too many Cook County residents and the
challenging budget environment in which Cook County government continues to operate. As the
Board of Review has demonstrated in the past, we continue to look for ways to make a dollar go
further by operating more ef?ciently and effectively.

We are here today to request your support for the President?s Executive Budget
Recommendation of $8,226,970. This necessary budget allocation will enable the Board of
Review to function and to adequately serve the homeowners and taxpayers of Cook County. As
an independently elected quasi-judicial agency charged with adjudicating property assessment
appeals, the Board of Review is small in size but has a large impact on the stability and
reliability of revenues generated through the collection of real estate taxes.

When we appeared before you last year to speak on behalf of our budget request for
Fiscal Year 2012, we stated it was the Board?s goal for the last property assessment appeal
session not only to get the tax bills out in a timely manner but to take advantage of a unique
opportunity to ?right the ship? in the billing calendar and get the tax bills out in a timely manner
from this day forward, to save the county, taxing bodies and ultimately the taxpayers of Cook
County millions of dollars.

I am pleased to report today that the Board of Review completed its prior appeals session
on April 18, 2012, and thus enabled the second installment property tax bills to be payable on
August 1. Because of the strong efforts by the Assessor?s Office, the Treasurer?s Of?ce, the
Clerk?s Of?ce and the Board of Review, Cook County issued its property tax bills on time for
the ?rst time in 34 years.

This accomplishment bene?ts everyone in Cook County. When tax bills are
delayed, schools and local governments incur additional borrowing costs to meet their ?scal
responsibilities or in the alternative they must redirect reserves - thereby forfeiting interest
income upon which they normally rely. These additional costs are passed on to the taxpayers of
Cook County via increased taxes and levies. The Commissioners of the Board of Review have
spoken with many school administrators and they have been uniform and clear: schools districts
need to spend money on children and education - not bankers, lawyers and interest payments.

The Board of Review is committed to making this achievement permanent. The Board
must complete its current session by April 19, 2013 for the property tax bills to be mailed and
due on the statutory deadline. This deadline is challenging, because the current session is the tri-
annual reassessment of the City of Chicago, containing half of all County parcels. Accordingly,

the Board of Review expects to review a greater number of parcels as compared to last year?s
session of 340,000 parcels.

In order to maximize our likelihood of ?nishing our analysis and rulings on time, the
Board of Review opened the ?rst group of townships for its current session on August 6, 2012
- 30 days earlier than prior years. Further, the Board of Review worked with the County?s
Bureau of Technology to upgrade the Board?s online ?ling system that went live in 2011. In
its ?rst year, 27% of complaints were ?led online. The enhancements to the Board?s digital
infrastructure improve the usability, accountability and ef?ciency of the online ?ling system,
and will increase the number of appeals ?led online. For example, upgrades enable taxpayers
to ?le their appeals before their township is open, instead of being required to ?le in the limited
window when their township is open, and the system now allows online access for the bulk ?ling
of appeals relating to multiple PIN properties such as condominium buildings.

While the current online ?ling system was an enormous move forward for the Board, it is
only the beginning, as the Board of Review is moving quickly to a paperless work?ow process.
The Board of Review submitted an application package to the County?s IT Collaborative Board
and was recently allocated initial ?nding for the development and implementation of the
Board?s enterprise management system.

In addition to fully and fairly reviewing more property assessment appeals faster, the
Board delivered programs to provide more and better services to the taxpayers of Cook County.
The Board of Review worked with Treasurer?s Of?ce, the Assessor?s Of?ce, and the Clerk?s
Of?ce to create the online Property Tax Portal, a one stop shop for homeowners and property
owners that provides a single integrated website for all real estate matters. The Board published
an Annual Report outlining activities for the 2011 session, and we remain committed to
explaining the operations of the Board to the public, setting benchmarks and regularly reporting
to the public as to how we are achieving these goals. Finally, the Commissioners and the staff
of the Board presented more than 165 outreach seminars during the past year, partnering with
many of you and other elected, community and religious leaders throughout the County. These
workshops have helped thousands of homeowners ?le tax appeals, and we bring the Board?s
appeal process to underserved communities, including citizens lacking intemet access or ready
transportation.

We believe funding our agency at $8,226,970 is responsible spending and a smart
investment in the future of Cook County. Once again, thank you for providing us the
opportunity to be part of this hearing process. We will be happy to try and answer any questions
you may have at this time.

Discussion of 2012 Activities and 2013 Initiatives

BOR completed its prior session on April 18. 2012. positioning the Cook County
Property Tax System to issue second installment bills payable on August tst. the
first time in 34 years. This accomplishment benelited local taxing jurisdictions.
which avoided spending interest bearing reserves or issuing tax anticipation
warrants. The cost to taxing jurisdictions of late bills is est'rnated to be at minimum
per month. Prior year's bills were three months late. costing taxing
jurisdictions at least These costs were avoided this year.

BOR must complete its current session by April 19. 2013 for bills to be due on the
statutory deadline. This poses a challenge as current session is the tri-annual
reassessment of Chicago containing half of all County parcels. BOR expects to
review a greater number of parcels as compared to its prior session of 340.000
parcels.

30 days earlier than prior years. This adjustment. and other changes to BOR
