EXPLANATION
Chicago Housing Authority’s (“CHA”) Plan for Transformation represents a new beginning for public
housing in Chicago. Through this IGA, CHA will partner with The City of Chicago Board of Education
(“CPS”) related to the installation of a new library at Carver Elementary School in order to enhance
educational and recreational opportunities for families living at Altgeld Gardens and the surrounding
communities. The new Chicago Public Library (CPL) branch will replace the library that was closed due
to the poor conditions of the building.
The new library, which shall be named the Chicago Public Library Branch at Wheatley Child Parent
Center, will provide resources for Carver Elementary School and the surrounding community. Carver
Elementary School is located on the far south side of Chicago in the Altgeld Gardens family
development. The new library will have the space necessary for computer workstations, reference books
and other educational and recreational material. Additionally, the library will allow Carver Elementary
School staff to offer a learning experience for students who need resources and materials for academic
improvement. CHA will contribute $100,000 for this project and CPL will also match the contribution,
leaving the remaining balance of this project to be paid by CPS.
Based on the foregoing, it is in the best interest of CHA to enter into an Intergovernmental Agreement
with CPS related to the installation of a library at Carver Elementary. Through the IGA, CHA will
contribute $100,000 in funding toward the total cost of the project in the amount of $100,000.
