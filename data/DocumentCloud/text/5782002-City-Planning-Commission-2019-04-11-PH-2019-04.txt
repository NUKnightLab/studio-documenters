NOTICE OF PUBLIC HEARING
A public hearing will be held by the Detroit City Planning Commission in the Committee of the
Whole Room, 13th Floor, Coleman A. Young Municipal Center, 2 Woodward Avenue, Detroit,
Michigan 48226, on
THURSDAY, APRIL 11, 2019 AT 5:15 PM
to consider the request of Parkstone Development Partners on behalf of Better Made Snack Foods,
Inc. to amend Article XVII, District Map No. 25 of the 1984 Detroit City Code, Chapter 61,
Zoning, by showing a M2 (Restricted Industrial District) zoning classification where a R2 (TwoFamily Residential District) zoning classification currently exists on property at 6576, 6582, 6598,
6600, 6602, and 6608 Harding Avenue, near the intersection of Harper Avenue and French Road.
The location of the proposed rezoning is indicated as the highlighted area on the accompanying
map.
The proposed map amendment is being requested to develop the presently vacant green space into
an employee parking lot.
The pertinent zoning district classifications are described as follows:
R2 Two-Family Residential District
The district is designed to protect and enhance those areas developed or likely to develop
with single- or two-family dwellings. The district regulations are designed to promote a
suitable environment for homes and for activities connected with family life. The only
principal uses permitted by right are single- and two-family dwellings. Additional uses are
conditional.
M2 Restricted Industrial District
This district is designed for a wide range of industrial and related uses which can function
with a minimum of undesirable effects. Industrial establishments of this type provide a
buffer between residential districts and intensive industrial districts. New residential
construction is excluded from this district with the exception of loft conversions of
existing buildings and of residential uses combined in structures with permitted
commercial uses. These requirements are both to protect residences from an undesirable
environment and to ensure reservation of adequate areas for industrial development.
A Zoning Ordinance map amendment requires approval of the City Council after a public hearing
and after receipt of a report and recommendation by the City Planning Commission. This Zoning

 Ordinance map amendment request is being considered consistent with the provisions of Article
III, Division 3 of Chapter 61 of the 1984 Detroit City Code, the Detroit Zoning Ordinance.
You may present your views on this proposal by attending this hearing, by authorizing others to
represent you, or by writing to this office prior to the hearing; 2 Woodward Avenue, Room 208,
Detroit, Michigan 48226 (FAX: 313-224-4336). Because it is possible that some who are affected
by this proposal may not have been notified, it is suggested that you kindly inform your neighbors
so that they too may express their positions if they so desire.
With advance notice of seven calendar days, the City of Detroit will provide interpreter services
at public meetings, including language translation and reasonable ADA accommodations. Please
contact the Civil Rights, Inclusion and Opportunity Department at (313) 224-4950, through the
TTY number 711, or email crio@detroitmi.gov to schedule these services.
