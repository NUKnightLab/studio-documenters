Inspiration Corporation, Chicago: This grant will fund the expansion of evidence-based cognitive
behavioral therapy groups to all sites operated by the organization. The groups support the overall
employment program of the organization by teaching key coping skills and anger management strategies
to avoid inappropriate behavior in the workplace that may result in termination of employment. This is
an expansion of a pilot group funded by a capacity building grant in the last grant cycle. The groups will
serve individuals from Uptown, Garfield Park, Woodlawn, Morgan Park, Roseland, and South Deering.
Respond Now: This grant will fund a key coordinating position at the organization to work with the
Housing Authority of Cook County and other organizations to begin an HACC pilot project allowing
certain individuals with felony records to live in HACC housing or subsidized housing. The program has
very detailed and carefully tailored criteria. It seeks to address the most basic of risk factors in violence
and criminal involvement, stable housing. The program will serve the South Suburbs.
Children’s Research Triangle: This grant will fund a partnership between CRT and Jane Addams
High School. The school serves youth who have dropped out of their traditional schools and are now
seeking to complete high school at an age that most schools would not enroll them 17 - 21. The program
will engage 150 students through one or more of the following services: youth workshops on the impact
of violence and trauma; Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy; Attachment, Self-Regulation,
and Competency Therapy; and Structured Psychotherapy for Adolescents Responding to Chronic Stress
(SPARCS). Teachers will also receive training in understanding the impact of violence and identifying
trauma symptoms. The student body primarily consists of youth from Pilsen, Englewood, Fuller Park,
East and West Garfield Park, North and South Lawndale, and Washington Park.

was started last fiscal year through Violence Prevention funds. The program is a peer mentor and
support-based aftercare program for individuals who completed court ordered domestic abuse
programming. It pays peer mentors who have completed the program to act as mentors and coordinators

Resilient Youth (parenting). The program serves individuals from anywhere in Cook County.

Family Mediation Program” to the Bridgeview and Skokie Courthouses. These programs serve as
diversion or alternative adjudication options for youth in the juvenile court accused of certain crimes.
The goal is to restore the victim, provide restitution to the victim or community, and hold the juvenile
accountable while ensuring the process is fair and the young person feels a sense of justice. The program
will serve communities in the South West and North Suburbs that are served by the respective
courthouses.

PROPOSED NO CASH BID REQUEST
Requestor: Keith R. Sbiral, AICP, Village Manager, Village of Brookfield
Request: Approval of No Cash Bid Request
Location:

Village of Brookfield

Volume and Property Index Number:
176, 15-34-221-004-0000; 176, 15-34-221-005-0000
Summary: The Village of Brookfield, Illinois (the “Village”), hereby requests an over-the-counter
no-cash bid for the following parcels. This Request Package contains two (2) PIN’s. The two
above-referenced parcels are collectively referred to herein as the “Property”. The Property is comprised
of two (2) adjacent parcels located at 3415 Maple Avenue, Brookfield, Illinois 60513. The Property is a
dilapidated parking lot. No structures exist on the Property. In October of 2014, by means of the Cook
County No-Cash Bid Program, the Village acquired title to the parcel immediately south of the requested
Property, which is improved with an unoccupied and dilapidated single-story commercial structure
formerly used as a bowling alley. The Village seeks to acquire and hold the Property for redevelopment
pending a future proposal by a yet-to-be-determined developer for commercial use of the Property and
adjacent parcel. Acquisition of the Property through the Cook County No-Cash Bid Program will benefit
the Village by increasing the potential for a commercial development on the Property, and the adjacent
parcel owned by the Village, by providing a larger contiguous parcel and adequate off-street parking.
Commercial development of the Property will benefit the Village by increasing the Village’s property tax
base and by offering additional employment opportunities to local residents.
If the Village is successful in acquiring the Property through the No-Cash Bid Program, it will file for tax
exempt status and will maintain the Property as tax exempt until such time as it is conveyed to a third
party for development. The Village represents that there currently exists no Third Party Request by a
developer, organization, or other private party which would result in the Village’s conveyance of
certificates of purchase for, or perfected tax deeds to, the Property to such a developer, organization, or
private party. The Village will bear all legal and other costs associated with the acquisition of these
parcels. The Village agrees to submit an annual report on the status of these parcels for five (5) years or
until development is complete, whichever occurs last, as required by the Cook County No-Cash Bid
Ordinance, to the Cook County Bureau of Economic Development, 69 West Washington Street, Suite
2900, Chicago, Illinois 60602.

Summary: I am delighted to submit this letter of request for the City of Harvey’s interest in Cook
County’s No Cash Bid Program to the Cook County Board of Commissioners. There are a total of 79
Parcels listed in our request and they are as follows. As indicated in Resolution 2772 and amended in
Resolution 2775, the City of Harvey requests 79 parcels of land for the redevelopment of our major
thoroughfares and Downtown Business District areas.
The City will retain legal counsel and pay all costs for tax deeds. Currently, the City has no “Third Party
Requestors.” The City will report as required to the Cook County Bureau Economic Development
annually from the date of sale on each parcel for five years or until the development is completed or
whichever comes last. The City will file for tax exempt status for PINs which will be used for municipal
purposes or maintain the status until tax deed(s) are conveyed to developers. If a City of Harvey lien is
cleared by the no cash bid, the City agrees to this in that the future redevelopment is more valuable to the
City than the cost of the municipal lien. If a Cook County lien is on a parcel, the City agrees to reinstate
the lien after the tax sale for the County with an intergovernmental agreement to be recorded.
