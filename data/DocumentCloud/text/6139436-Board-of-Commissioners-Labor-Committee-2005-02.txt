RESOLUTION TO INCREASE EMPLOYEE HEALTHCARE CONTRIBUTIONS (PROPOSED
RESOLUTION). Submitting a Proposed Resolution sponsored by Gregg Goslin and Mike
Quigley, County Commissioners. Co-Sponsored by Peter N. Silvestri, Elizabeth Ann Doody
Gorman and Anthony J. Peraica, County Commissioner.
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
RESOLUTION TO INCREASE EMPLOYEE HEALTHCARE CONTRIBUTIONS
WHEREAS, Cook County employees enjoy excellent healthcare as part of their benefits
package; and
WHEREAS, Cook County employees have for years received these stellar health benefits at
rates far below other governments and private industry; and
WHEREAS, Cook County currently has 26,357 employees and 37,176 dependents enrolled in
the County’s health insurance program; and
WHEREAS, ever-increasing healthcare costs in conjunction with stagnant employee
contributions has had the unintended effect of increasing the already generous employee
benefits package; and
WHEREAS, since 2000, the County’s cost of health benefits per employee has increased 45%;
and
WHEREAS, according to the Cook County Cost Control Task Force the general practice of
most employers is to set minimal employee healthcare contributions at 20 percent of premium
costs for employees and 30 percent for dependent coverage; and
WHEREAS, Cook County employees’ average contributions are four percent for employees
and two percent for dependent coverage; and
WHEREAS, budget shortfalls have made it necessary to address the issue of increasing
employee healthcare contributions and bring them in line with other reasonable employee
contribution plans; and
WHEREAS, in FY2004 all non-union employees with yearly salaries of $65,000 and above
were required to increase their monthly health insurance contributions to .7% of their salaries
for single employee coverage, 1.4% for family HMO coverage and 1.5% for family PPO
coverage.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners does
hereby expand the County’s employee healthcare contributions plan to .7% for single
employee coverage, 1.4% for dependent HMO coverage and 1.5% for dependent PPO
coverage for all full-time employees; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the County Administration’s negotiation teams are hereby
directed to include the new employee healthcare contributions plan in the collective bargaining
process and that the Cook County Board of Commissioners will implement this plan
immediately for non-union employees upon passage of this Resolution.
*Referred to the Committee on Finance Labor Subcommittee on 01/20/05.

RESOLUTION TO MODERNIZE THE COUNTY COMPENSATION SCHEDULE (PROPOSED
RESOLUTION). Submitting a Proposed Resolution sponsored by Gregg Goslin and Mike
Quigley, County Commissioners. Co-Sponsored by Peter N. Silvestri, Elizabeth Ann Doody
Gorman and Anthony J. Peraica, County Commissioners.
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
RESOLUTION TO MODERNIZE THE COUNTY COMPENSATION SCHEDULE
WHEREAS, Cook County employees receive annual step increases for the first five years of
their employment and step increases every two years thereafter and employees also receive
annual or semi-annual cost of living adjustments (COLAS); and
WHEREAS, the average yearly step increase is approximately 4.5 percent and the average
COLA is approximately 3 percent; and
WHEREAS, the total annual increase of 7.5 percent is significantly higher than the national
average for the U.S. workforce of 3.5 percent; and
WHEREAS, taxes generate 44.5% of Cook County’s revenues; and
WHEREAS, Cook County’s annual step increase cost taxpayers approximately $26 million per
year and the average COLA costs taxpayers approximately $39 million per year; with the
average year costing taxpayers an additional $65 million per year for wage increases alone;
and
WHEREAS, a modification of our salary system will provide job security at a time when other
local government entities have resorted to layoffs; and
WHEREAS, Cook County faces a short-term fiscal crisis in eliminating a $73 million budget
gap in FY2005 as well as a larger long-term problem: how to make Cook County government
operate more cost effectively and efficiently without resorting to new or increased taxes; and
WHEREAS, because of the lapse in current contracts, now is the time to re-structure our
employee compensation schedule for current employees as well as new hires.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the County Administration’s negotiation teams
are hereby directed to eliminate the automatic annual step increases for employees in the
collective bargaining process; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners will implement
this plan for all non-union employees immediately upon passage of this Resolution.
*Referred to the Committee on Finance Labor Subcommittee on 01/20/05.
