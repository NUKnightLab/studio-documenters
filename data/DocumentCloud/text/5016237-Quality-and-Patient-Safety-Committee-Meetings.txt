matters. He stated that staff are in continued readiness for the visit from representatives from The Joint

A team of surveyors from the Department of Justice visited Cermak Health Services from April 30th

Following the presentation, Director Driscoll requested that the Committee receive reports on this
subject on a regular basis.
Chairman Gugenheim recommended that the administration think about including patients in some of
these processes. Ms. Toliver noted that she has kept a list of patients throughout the years who would
be excellent in that capacity. For this to happen, the Patient Complaint/Grievance Council would
need to develop criteria, expectations and training. As this would be a volunteer process, Corporate
Compliance would also need to be involved in the process to bring them in as volunteers, so there are
some initial steps that would need to be taken.

 Our Nursing Story
What have we ingrained in our ED Department?
A customer is the most important visitor on our
premises. He is not dependent on us. We are
dependent on him. He is not an interruption in our
work. He is the purpose of it. He is not an outsider in
our business. He is part of it. We are not doing him a
favor by serving him. He is doing us a favor by giving
us an opportunity to do so (Gandhi).
