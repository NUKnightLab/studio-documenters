PROPOSED RESOLUTION
REQUESTING A HEARING OF THE LEGISLATION AND INTERGOVERNMENTAL RELATIONS

WHEREAS, the Intermediate Service Centers (“ISCs”) of Cook County play a crucial role in providing shared
services to the public and non-public school districts of suburban Cook County; and

Page 1 of 8

 WHEREAS, the Regional Safe Schools Program (“RSSP”) is one of the critical educational programs offered to
the youth of suburban Cook County, and has been offered to the suburban Cook County public schools districts
since 1997; and
WHEREAS, the RSSP initiative serves as the key youth drop-out and expulsion prevention program that keeps
young people (Grades 6-12) in school with an opportunity for graduation and enhanced success; and
WHEREAS, should these students not receive educational services and enter into the juvenile justice system, the
cost to the State of Illinois is egregious; and
WHEREAS, Governor Rauner February budget address eliminated grant support for the RSSP throughout the
State; and
BE IT RESOLVED, since the dissolution of the Suburban Cook County Regional Office of Education (“ROE”)
# 14 in 2010, the ISCs have taken on all duties and responsibilities of the Suburban Cook County Regional
Office of Education; and
BE IT RESOLVED, all other 101 counties in the State of Illinois provide fiscal supports for their ROEs, and
consider their ROEs to be a branch of county government;
BE IT RESOLVED, Counties supply such tangible supports such as providing rent-free space in county
buildings, county-supplied insurance benefits, county personnel to carry out ROE duties, and salary stipends for
ROE administrators; and
BE IT RESOLVED, the continued diminishment of state and federal grants and funding has caused the ISCs to
incur annual fiscal deficits; and
BE IT RESOLVED, the continued existence of the ISCs is now in question due to the existing fiscal constraints
and lack of support of Cook County; and
BE IT RESOLVED, these fiscal constraints call into question whether the ISCs can continue to provide
educator licensure support, bus driver training (for all of Cook County and Chicago Public Schools), issuance of
building and occupancy permits, Health/Life Safety inspections, annual Illinois State Board of Education
compliance visits, non-public school recognition services, truancy services, McKinney-Vento homeless services,
and professional development activities at several levels;
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that the Legislation and Intergovernmental Committee of the Cook County
Commissioners will hold a Hearing to examine the relationship between the County of Cook and the Intermediate
Service Centers; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the intent of the Hearing will be to investigate how supports can be
provided to the Intermediate Service Centers to carry out their critical mission of serving the youth of Cook
County, Illinois.

PROPOSED ORDINANCE
AN ORDINANCE BANNING COOK COUNTY LIQUOR CODE LICENSE HOLDERS FROM THE
SALE, OFFERING, PROVISION, FURNISHING, BARTERING, EXCHANGE OR GIFT OF
POWDERED ALCOHOL
WHEREAS, Cook County is a home rule unit of government pursuant to the 1970 Illinois Constitution, Article
VII, Section 6(a); and
WHEREAS, pursuant to its home rule power, Cook County may exercise any power and perform any function
relating to its government and affairs including the power to regulate for the protection of the public health,
safety, morals, and welfare; and
WHEREAS, in the spring of 2014, Arizona-based Lipsmark, LLC announced that it intended to market
powdered alcohol under the name “Palcohol”; and
WHEREAS, the product was briefly approved for sale by the U.S. Treasury Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and
Trade Bureau, but the approval was temporarily rescinded because label approvals were given in error; and
WHEREAS, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has concluded that it does not have a legal basis to block
market entry of the product at this time; and
WHEREAS, the Food and Drug Administration commented that its review focused solely on the non-alcohol
ingredients added to the product and that it does not have concerns that the ingredients, when added to the
alcoholic beverage products, render the products adulterated under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act;
and
WHEREAS, in March of 2015, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade approved labels for Palcohol; and
WHEREAS, in Palcohol is expected to be offered for sale this summer; and
WHEREAS, Lipsmark plans to manufacture Palcohol in two different formulations: an ingestible beverage
formulation and a non-ingestible industrial formulation; and
WHEREAS, Palcohol’s ingestible beverage formulation is freeze-dried powderized alcohol which turns water
into either vodka or rum, or optional flavors including cosmopolitan, mojito and the Powderita- a powdered
margarita; and
WHEREAS, a package of Palcohol weighs only an ounce, can fit into a pocket and in addition to being mixed
with liquids, can be sprinkled onto food, or snorted, which increases the risk of abuse, binge consumption and
concealment; and
WHEREAS, snorting powdered alcohol elevates the risk of alcohol poisoning and is extremely dangerous
because the alcohol is quickly absorbed by the body and results in immediate intoxication; and
WHEREAS, ingestible powdered alcohol has the potential to be a public health nuisance; and
WHEREAS, the portable nature of ingestible powdered alcohol makes it more enticing and easier for underage
drinkers to use discreetly; and
WHEREAS, underage drinking is a significant problem that threatens the health and safety of our youth,
contributes to crime and negatively impacts the entire community; and
Page 1 of 8

 WHEREAS, many states, including New York, Alaska, Delaware, Louisiana, South Carolina and Vermont have
already banned ingestible powdered alcohol, and Colorado and Ohio are considering bans; and
WHEREAS, the public health risks and potential for abuse created by ingestible powdered alcohol far outweigh
any value it may have in the marketplace; and
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, the above recitals are expressly incorporated herein and made part
hereof as though fully set forth herein.
BE IT FURTHUR ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that Chapter 6, Alcoholic
Liquor, Article II, Division 1, Sec. 6-39 of the Cook County Code of Ordinances is hereby enacted as follows:

PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT
AMENDING THE COOK COUNTY ETHICS ORDINANCE TO CLARIFY THE COOK COUNTY BOARD
OF ETHICS’S EXISTING POWERS TO IMPOSE FINES FOR ORDINANCE VIOLATIONS AND TO SUE
TO ENFORCE ITS DETERMINATIONS
WHEREAS, the County of Cook is a Home Rule Unit of Government pursuant to the 1970 Illinois Constitution,
Article VII, Section 6; and,

Page 1 of 8

 WHEREAS, pursuant to its home rule power, the County of Cook may exercise any power and perform any
function relating to its government and affairs, including the power to regulate for the protection of the public
health, safety, morals and welfare; and,
WHEREAS, in 1993, this Board of Commissioners exercised that home rule power to enact the Cook County
Ethics Ordinance (“Ethics Ordinance”), which is, by its own terms, applicable to the conduct of all County
officials, appointees and employees; and,
WHEREAS, this Board of Commissioners further exercised that home rule power to create the Cook County
Board of Ethics (“Board of Ethics”) to enforce the Cook County Ethics Ordinance; and,
WHEREAS, from time to time, this Board of Commissioners has amended the Ethics Ordinance; specifically, in
one of the 2004 amendments, the Board of Commissioners changed the manner in which fines for violation are
imposed, by eliminating the need to go to court to obtain a conviction, and instead vesting in the Board of Ethics
the power to make findings of violations and impose fines; and
WHEREAS, the Ethics Ordinance currently grants the Board of Ethics the power to issue fines against County
officials, appointees and employees for violations of the Cook County Ethics Ordinance and sue in its own name
to enforce its determinations; and,
WHEREAS, the power of the Cook County Board of Ethics to enforce the Cook County Ethics Ordinance and
pursue litigation in its own name has been called into question; and
