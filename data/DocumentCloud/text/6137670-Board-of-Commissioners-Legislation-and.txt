most important duties of government and is paramount in a civilized society; and
WHEREAS, public safety is enhanced by different levels of government recognizing
their responsibility in a system of different responsibilities among such
governments, while working together on maintaining the quality of life; and

such officers are the closest to the people, with a better understanding of the
residents and community in which they serve; and
WHEREAS, the County Sheriff’s Office plays an important role in working with such
local police jurisdictions, augmenting their services through regional law
enforcement programs and initiatives, and by providing resources and facilities that
individual police departments may be unable to provide; and
WHEREAS, budgetary constraints have compelled the Cook County Sheriff’s
Police Department to become the primary law enforcement agency in Ford Heights,
a south suburban community in Cook County; and

assume such duties in additional municipalities.

and duties to additional municipal jurisdictions; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Sheriff’s Office is advised that no additional
resources will be provided to expand such authority and duties; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the State’s Attorney’s Office is directed to
initiate any legal action necessary to prevent the expansion of such police authority
and duties to additional municipalities.
