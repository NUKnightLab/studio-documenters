Recommendations, Discussion / Information Item
A.

Strategic planning discussion
Topic: Professional Education, presented by Dr. John O’Brien (Attachment #4)

Douglas Elwell, Deputy CEO of Finance and Strategy, provided an introduction. He stated that, based on the
last cost report, CCHHS spends about $70 million per year on medical education; that is a pretty significant part
of the total budget. He noted that Illinois is one (1) of approximately eight (8) states that does not pay for
medical education through the Medicaid Program. That is a continuing issue, especially for safety-net facilities
who routinely do not garner as many Medicare patients, but who have many Medicaid patients.
Mr. Elwell introduced Richard Sewell, Associate Dean of Community and Public Health Practice at UIC School
of Public Health, who will be moderating the strategic planning discussions. Mr. Sewell has an extensive
background in this area; he specializes in health policy, management, community health needs assessment and
strategic planning.
Dr. O’Brien reviewed the presentation, which included information on the following subjects:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Department of Professional Education (PE): Scope of Functions
Stroger Hospital Programs
“Our” (CCHHS Employed) Residents
Rotator Programs
Medicare Reimbursement
Strategic Planning – Department of PE: Lead in Medical Education
- How do we bring benefits to the patients and communities CCHHS serves?
- CCHHS Residencies are “Feeders” for our Attending Staff
- How do we reduce healthcare disparities for our patients?
- How well do the size and scope of the residencies reflect our patients and the community served by
CCHHS?
- Maximizing Resources to Ensure the Greatest Benefit
- Our training programs must enhance our System’s quality and safety in a patient-centered fashion
• Clinical Learning Environment Review (CLER) Program and Grant Summary

Director Junge inquired regarding the number of residents who are on some kind of immigration status. Dr.
O’Brien responded that the number is 168 of the total 391 residents. As the administration moves forward, one
of the things they will be looking at is - what should that balance be? The philosophy has always been that the
organization wants to have the best physician trainee in that role that it can get, regardless of where that resident
is from.
During the discussion of the different programs, Chairman Gugenheim remarked that the areas of psychiatry
and behavioral health were not included; in terms of the strategic plan, it seems that those areas are absolutely
essential to be included. Dr. O’Brien stated that, in the past, Stroger Hospital had rotators coming from Rush
for psychiatry; however, both parties agreed to discontinue that program, as the feedback from Rush was that it
was not a good educational experience at that time. Part of the reason for that was due to staffing issues. Since
then, a more robust attending staff has been built up, so conversations are being held with both Rush and the
University of Illinois about bringing some residents back; there have also been conversations with them
regarding sending psychiatric residents to Cermak Health Services.

Recommendations, Discussion / Information Item
A. Strategic planning discussion (continued)
Chairman Gugenheim inquired regarding the subject of research, as it relates to education. Mr. Elwell
responded that a separate presentation on that subject will be provided in the near future by Dr. William Trick,
who heads up the largest part of the research. Dr. Marsh noted that, with regard to the connection between
research and education, they are certainly intimately involved; however, from an administrative and leadership
perspective, she believes that it is appropriate that they are separate. They each have very separate regulatory
bodies and responsibilities that require separate offices, areas of focus and levels of expertise. Chairman
Gugenheim noted that she would like to see some dotted lines reflecting their connection, in terms of strategic
planning. Director Lerner agreed with the comments; he suggested that the real connection for an academic
institution is how well horizontally all the objectives connect.
Mr. Sewell concluded the discussion by stating that, once the process has been finalized and arrangements have
been made in terms of who else from his organization will be part of the team working on these efforts, he
expects that he and his team will be hearing the information and input from the strategic planning discussions
and presentations; they will then condense and prepare it for consideration by the System Board as components
of the plan that will result.

 Medicare Reimbursement (again)
• Residents Provide Patient Care that is 24/7
• They are Supervised by Attendings
• Supervision Policies reviewed by GMEC and EMS Annually (as
required by the Joint Commission and the ACGME)
• Attending must independently see the patient and document in
order to bill (inpatient)
• Duty hours rules for residents have stretched inpatient coverages
• Better decisions/fewer errors with more sleep
• More hand offs
• Using more mid-level providers to help provide patient care basics, but this
rarely helps the call schedule.

Page 32 of 50

 Medicare Reimbursement (again)
• Medicare Reimbursement for Training Residents​
• Indirect Costs​

• Residents order more tests etc.​
• Hospital receives higher reimbursement for Medicare charges.​

• Calculation of reimbursement level based on # of Residents/Bed.
• Direct Costs​
• Receive a % of salary/benefits for each resident trained on site.​
• Based on the number of inpatient Medicare patients.​

• Number of residents reimbursed was capped in 1996.​
• Stroger’s Medicare Reimbursement​

• CCHHS $/resident is lower than most other teaching hospitals.​
• ~ $22,500 per resident​

• Reimbursement offsets some of the salary/benefits paid by the
hospital.

 Lead In Medical Education
• What does this mean?
• Department of Professional Education (PE) must facilitate the
CCHHS mission:
• PE must maximize resources to ensure the greatest benefit for
the patients and communities we serve
• Our Training Programs must enhance our system's quality and
safety in a patient-centered fashion.
• Our Programs’ must be have measurements of their caliber, and
these measurements should reflect good to aspirational
programs.

Page 35 of 50

10

 PE- How do we bring benefits to the Patients
and Communities that CCHHS serves?
• Provide well-trained Physician Staff to CCHHS
• Reduce health care disparities in our patients
• Reduce Length of Stay (LOS), overutilization of services

 PE – How do we reduce healthcare disparities
for our patients?
• Education – Need to raise awareness among trainees (Obesity,
Diabetes, Diabetic Retinopathy, Trauma, Hypertension Control, Colon
Cancer Screening etc have been clearly associated with differences in
race/socioeconomic status nationally).
• Programs to develop curriculum specific to their specialty

• Data – How are we doing? (Quality of Care and Benchmarking)
• Review residencies-Preventive Medicine

Page 38 of 50

13

 PE-How well do the size and scope of the
residencies reflect our Patients and the
Community served by CCHHS?
• Training Programs are historically hospital-centric.
• Currently moving some Residents out into the community.

• Reviewing each program's size and scope to
understand how it benefits our patients and the
community.

• Due to market forces, difficulty attracting trainees to some of the
programs that would benefit our patients (Primary Care,
Preventive Medicine)

• Size often dictated by need to cover inpatient call schedules

Page 39 of 50

14

 PE- Maximizing Resources to Ensure the
Greatest Benefit
• Reduction of Length of Stay
• Reduction of excessive use of tests
• Plan: Joining the "Choose Wisely" Campaign

• American Board of Internal Medicine initiative to improve
outcomes while cutting costs (e.g. stop routine peptic ulcer
prophylaxis in the hospital)

• Increase QI and measurements of resource use

Page 40 of 50

15

 PE- Our Training Programs must enhance our
system's quality and safety in a patient-centered
fashion.
• CLER program

• Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) has
developed a non-accrediting arm: Clinical Learning Environment
Review (C.L.E.R.)
• Aims to improve the learning environment of all institutions
(including quality of care and patient safety) and reduce disparities
between them
• Site Visits (Similar to The Joint Commission)
• Focus on six areas:
• Patient Safety
• Quality
• Transitions in Care
• Supervision
• Duty hours oversight/fatigue management,
• Professionalism

• Forcing greater involvement between GME and institutional
leadership (especially in the areas of quality and patient safety).
Page 41 of 50

16

 CLER Program
• Visited every major institution in the U.S. over three
years (JSH twice) and recently released its findings:
•
•
•
•

Variability Across Institutions
GME is Silo’ed
Faculty Engagement in Quality and Safety is Low
Interdisciplinary Learning Is Minimal
