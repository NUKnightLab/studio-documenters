Requesting management to monitor hiring of residents by
contractors, specifically for non-labor positions.

CHA monitors contracts for both trade (construction) and non-trade (non-labor)
positions. The standards for verifying compliance are as follows:
1. Employee name should appear on payroll for certified projects
2. Employees wages should equal what contractor has reported on their Schedule D
3. Employee should be visible on site where work is being performed during site
visits.
