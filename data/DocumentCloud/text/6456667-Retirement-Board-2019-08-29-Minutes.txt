The representatives from GRS distributed draft copies of both the detailed study and a summary
version for review at today’s meeting. Mr. Weiss indicated that they were willing to entertain any
questions trustees would have from either and proceeded to discuss the findings of the Study.
Trustee Lappe emphasized that these were preliminary findings.
Actuarial Experience studies are typically conducted at 5 year intervals to determine if the
economic and demographic assumptions utilized by the Actuaries in the annual valuations of the
Fund are valid. As such, Mr. Weiss reviewed a table in the summary report to provide a
comparison between the existing and recommended assumptions as a result of the study. The
following underlying assumptions and the resulting Actuaries recommendations for change were
discussed:
Future Expected Price Inflation: Currently at 2.75. As a result of the study, the actuaries
recommend a reduction to 2.25 which impacts upon the anticipated COLA Increases paid to future
Tier Two retirees.
Investment Return Assumption: Currently at 7.25%. As a result of their study, the actuaries
recommend a reduction to 6.75%.
Salary Increases: Currently at 3.75%. In the absence of a finalized contract and based on known
factors and consistent with expected price inflation, the actuaries are recommending 3.5%.
Mortality Assumptions: Mr. Weiss indicated that the Society of Actuaries just developed mortality
tables specific to Public Employee sectors and it is the most current applicable to public plans.
Retirement Rates: Mr. Weiss indicated a slight increase in the ages of current retirements at earlier
ages and a slight decrease at other ages. Trustee Wodnicki questioned the number of retirements
used.
Incidence of Disability: Mr. Weis indicated adjustments in Disability incidence based on actual
experience.
At the conclusion of the presentation, Trustee Wright asked for a motion to approve the report and
the recommended assumptions. Upon discussion it was determined that the Board would wait for
additional trustees to be present for inclusion in the vote to approve the Experience study and the
Funding resolution.
Trustee Wright then made a motion, seconded by Trustee Hamburger to go into executive session
under section 2 (c) (11) for the purpose of discussing scheduled Disability hearings.
