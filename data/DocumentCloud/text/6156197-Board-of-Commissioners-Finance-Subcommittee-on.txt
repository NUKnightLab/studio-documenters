letter of request. The Village of Flossmoor “Village” has established a Tax Increment Financing District “T.I.F.”
within the southwest area of the Village to promote the commercial development of the real estate located therein.
The Village has acquired by purchase a number of parcels in an effort to advance the commercial development
within the T.I.F., and desires to participate in the Cook County No Cash Bid program in order to acquire the four
tax delinquent parcels shown in this letter request. The Volume and PIN’s for the four parcels making up this
request, each and all of which are located within the Village’s T.I.F, are as follows. The above listed parcels would
be used by the Village, alone or in combination with other parcels acquired by the Village by purchase, to advance
the commercial development within the Village’s T.I.F. District to the benefit of the Village and all other taxing
districts within the T.I.F. District. Each and all of the four parcels shown above are vacant land (no buildings) and
are tax delinquent.
The Village will file for tax exempt status on each and all of the above listed parcels and hold them with other
exempt parcels within the T.I.F. until such time as appropriate commercial development is identified
and
approved. No third party requestors are currently involved in this request and the Village has no agreements or
proposals from any third parties regarding the above shown subject parcels. The Village Attorney is retained as
legal counsel to obtain the tax deeds for the subject parcels and the Village will bear all legal and other costs
associated with the acquisition of the parcels. The Village agrees to submit, to the Cook County Department of
Economic Development, No Cash Bid Reports on the status of each parcel for five years or until development is
complete, whichever occurs last, as required by the Cook County No Cash Bid Ordinance. Thank you for your help
in advancing the economic development interest of the Village of Flossmoor and the other taxing bodies within our
T.I.F. District and thereby the interests of the residents we serve.

We are requesting that a No Cash Bid be made on behalf of Village of Hoffman Estates for the following
property. This request package contains 1 PIN. This property is the Brookside pond that currently has no legal

vacant since 1993, and not been maintained; it is dirty and foul smelling and is continuing to create an erosion
problem for the adjoining residential properties, with many of the trees that surround the pond now falling into the
water. The Village would like to clean and maintain the pond and attempt to prevent further erosion onto the
adjacent properties. This would be of great benefit to the residents and the Village of Hoffman Estates. The Village
will file for a tax exempt status for this property as we will retain the property for municipal use; there is no Third
Party Request regarding the subject parcel.
The Village will retain legal counsel to obtain the tax deed and bear all legal and other costs associated with
acquisition of the parcel. The Village also agrees to submit to the Cook County Bureau of Economic
Development, No Cash Bid Reports on the status of each parcel for five years or until or until development

Summary: The Village of Wheeling, (the “Village”) has targeted five locations within the Village for vacant
land redevelopment or for the use for municipal purposes. In the interest of utilizing these properties for said
purposes, the Village is seeking title to the following tax delinquent properties and requests that the Cook County
Board of Commissioners submit a No Cash Bid for all five properties on behalf of the Village. This Request
Package contains the five (5) PINs which are vacant parcels of abandoned land at 857, 837, 817, and 802 Colonial
Drive and 896 Valley Stream Drive. The Village has determined the land to be undevelopable, but acquiring them
could help aid in the development of four parcels nearby (two Village owned parcels on Elmhurst Road and two
privately owned parcels at the west end of Colonial Drive). The land would be used by the Village for storm water
management and parking to increase the financial feasibility of developing the four adjacent parcels that are out of
the flood plain. Acquisition of the parcels will also allow the Village to address ongoing issues of creek
maintenance and public safety (the police regularly have complaints regarding the overgrown lots). In addition,
there is a good possibility of making a connection to a park to the west.
The Village does not, at the present time, have a Third Party Request by a developer, organization or other
private party, in which the Village would convey a certificate of purchase or the perfected tax deed of
the
above-listed PINs to that Third Party Requestor. The Village will file for tax exempt status as long as it retains the
PINs for municipal use, maintaining that status until any tax deed either or both properties is/are conveyed to a
potential developer. The Village agrees to submit, to the Cook County Department of Economic Development, No
Cash Bid Reports on the status of each parcel for five years, or until development is complete, whichever occurs
last, as required by the Cook County No Cash Bid Ordinance. Village of Wheeling will work to obtain the tax
deeds and will bear all legal and other costs associated with acquisition of the parcels.

Summary: The Village of Brookfield, Illinois (the “Village”), hereby requests an over-the-counter no-cash bid
for the following parcels. This Request Package contains two (2) PIN’s. The two above-referenced parcels are
collectively referred to herein as the “Property”. The Property is comprised of two (2) adjacent parcels located at
3415 Maple Avenue, Brookfield, Illinois 60513. The Property is a dilapidated parking lot. No structures exist on
the Property. In October of 2014, by means of the Cook County No-Cash Bid Program, the Village acquired title
to the parcel immediately south of the requested Property, which is improved with an unoccupied and dilapidated
single-story commercial structure formerly used as a bowling alley. The Village seeks to acquire and hold the
Property for redevelopment pending a future proposal by a yet-to-be-determined developer for commercial use of
the Property and adjacent parcel. Acquisition of the Property through the Cook County No-Cash Bid Program will
benefit the Village by increasing the potential for a commercial development on the Property, and the adjacent
parcel owned by the Village, by providing a larger contiguous parcel and adequate off-street parking.
Commercial development of the Property will benefit the Village by increasing the Village’s property tax base
and by offering additional employment opportunities to local residents.
If the Village is successful in acquiring the Property through the No-Cash Bid Program, it will file for tax exempt
status and will maintain the Property as tax exempt until such time as it is conveyed to a third party
for
development. The Village represents that there currently exists no Third Party Request by a developer,
organization, or other private party which would result in the Village’s conveyance of certificates of purchase for,
or perfected tax deeds to, the Property to such a developer, organization, or private party. The Village will bear all
legal and other costs associated with the acquisition of these parcels. The Village agrees to submit an annual report
on the status of these parcels for five (5) years or until development is complete, whichever occurs last, as required
by the Cook County No-Cash Bid Ordinance, to the Cook County Bureau of Economic Development, 69 West
Washington Street, Suite 2900, Chicago, Illinois 60602.

Summary: I am delighted to submit this letter of request for the City of Harvey’s interest in Cook County’s No
Cash Bid Program to the Cook County Board of Commissioners. There are a total of 79 Parcels listed in our
request and they are as follows. As indicated in Resolution 2772 and amended in Resolution 2775, the City of
Harvey requests 79 parcels of land for the redevelopment of our major thoroughfares and Downtown Business
District areas.
The City will retain legal counsel and pay all costs for tax deeds. Currently, the City has no “Third Party
Requestors.” The City will report as required to the Cook County Bureau Economic Development annually from
the date of sale on each parcel for five years or until the development is completed or whichever comes last. The
City will file for tax exempt status for PINs which will be used for municipal purposes or maintain the status until
tax deed(s) are conveyed to developers. If a City of Harvey lien is cleared by the no cash bid, the City agrees to
this in that the future redevelopment is more valuable to the City than the cost of the municipal lien. If a Cook
County lien is on a parcel, the City agrees to reinstate the lien after the tax sale for the County with an
intergovernmental agreement to be recorded.
