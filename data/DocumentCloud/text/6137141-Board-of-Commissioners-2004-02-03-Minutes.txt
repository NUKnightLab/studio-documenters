the exercise of its discretionary power to suspend, revoke, or refuse to issue or refuse
to renew any license, pennit, or other authority or privilege.
(b) A Cook County issued Certificate of Good Conduct and Rehabilitation shall not limit
or prevent the introduction of evidence of a prior conviction for purposes of

Section to an eligible offender as defined in Article II this Ordinance who has

be deemed to alter or limit or affect the manner of applying for pardons to the
Governor, and no certificate issued under this Article shall be deemed or construed to
be a Pardon.
Section 6-2

Grievance Process

It is not the intention of this Ordinance or the actions of the Review Panel or the Board of Cook County
Commissioners to replace or substitute any employee grievance process that currently exists in County
government. This Ordinance does not preclude a participant from exercising their due process rights that

OFFICE OF CAPITAL PLANNING AND POLICY, by Michael E. LaMont, Director,
transmitting a Communication, dated January 6, 2004:
Transmitted herewith for your approval is Change Order No. 3, payable to G.F.
STRUCTURES CORPORATION, for the Rockwell Warehouse Phase II Interior
Project at the Rockwell Warehouse. This change order is for work necessary to
complete the project. It is respectfully requested that this honorable body approve this
request.
Reason:

This change order will relocate the switchboard equipment from the
basement to the 1st floor, which is necessary to avoid excessive
Commonwealth Edison construction costs and increased monthly service
charges by ComEd. During the construction phase, problems arose with the
scheduling, coordinating, and pricing of Commonwealth Edison's portion
of the work. This new relocation will allow us to complete construction
without the need to coordinate and schedule work with Com Ed and will not
affect current monthly service fees. This also provides for a 105 day
contract extension.

deletion from the contract, installation of new plumbing fixtures and related
work in Division I, for a net credit. This also provides for a 265 day
contract extension.

PROJECT PROGRESS REPORT - DECEMBER 18, 2003
Commissioner Hansen asked when the computer server consolidation will be completed in the 69 West
Washington Building.
Mr. LaMont stated that in the next report he will project a time frame.
Commissioner Hansen asked Mr. LaMont if he would bring the Commissioners up-to-date on the 69
West Washington Building construction activities.
Mr. LaMont gave the committee a general overview of what has been occurring at the 69 West
Washington Building. He stated that on December 31, 2003, floors thirty through thirty-five were
reoccupied; however, they do not yet have sprinklers. A week later the pedway, daycare center and lobby
were opened, and the building became a public building. By January 9, 2004, floors five and six were
occupied; the fourth floor was occupied a week later. Mr. LaMont further stated that the sprinkler system
is being installed. At this time floors six and below have been completed. Currently floors seven through
eleven are being worked on; they should be reoccupied within the next two weeks. The next phase for
sprinkler installation will include floors twenty-nine through twenty-three. Those floors should be
completed on or before March I, 2004. Further he stated that the plan is to install five floors of sprinkler
systems in a month. He also stated that once floors one through thirty are completed, everyone from
floors thirty and above will relocate so that the sprinklers can be installed. In conclusion, Mr. LaMont
stated that the whole sprinkler project would be completed in mid-to-late summer.
Mr. LaMont stated that while the sprinklers are being installed the ceilings are also being replaced in most
areas, because most of the building had what is termed a "spline" ceiling. Such a ceiling is made of oneby-one tiles which are now being replaced by a two-by-two drop-in ceiling with new lighting.
Chainnan Sims asked whether the li ght fixtures and ceilings are covered under insurance.
Mr. LaMont stated that floors that were damaged by smoke, soot, fire or by water from below are
covered. The floors that did not suffer that type of damage will be covered and paid for by capital bonds.
Commissioner Hansen asked the estimated cost of the sprinkler system.
Mr. LaMont stated that $ 15 million was put into the capital program after the fire. The estimated cost of
the sprinklers and ceilings is $8.5 million.

537

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 3, 2004

Mr. LaMont stated that there are two other major projects. The first is a door unlocking system, which is
currently being installed and is expected to be completed in two weeks. At this time the doors are
unlocked; also there is extra security in the building walking on various floors and up staircases.
Commissioner Hansen asked the cost for the door unlocking system.
Mr. LaMont stated that the cost is about $350,000.00.
Commissioner Hansen requested a memorandum showing the current estimates for the projects at 69
West Washington.
Mr. LaMont responded that he will get the infonnation to the commissioners.
Commissioner Hansen asked who unlocks the doors in the instance of a fire.
Mr. LaMont stated that the doors are unlocked automatically or manually. Smoke detectors or sprinkler
flow trigger the automatic system ; the manual system is operated from the front console located on the
first floor.
Mr. LaMont stated that the other major project is putting in a visual detection system, which is termed
"occupant notification." He further stated that there may be other upgrades to the fire alann system. Mr.
LaMont concluded by saying with all the above mentioned projects, the cost is still below $15 million.
Commissioner Hansen asked if the ground floor escalators at 69 West Washington were operating.
Mr. LaMont stated that one of the escalators is undergoing renovation, which is partly due to the water
damage and the fact that it needed to be upgraded. He stated that this was a good opportunity to renovate
the escalator because the building has fewer occupants. The work will be completed in mid March.
Mr. LaMont stated that there is a project to install an elevator and an escalator on the west end of the
building. He stated that there is also a freight elevator that travels the length of the entire building.
Commissioner Hansen requested a cost estimate regarding the old nurses building.
Mr. LaMont replied that approximately $7 million has been spent on the building during the past eight
years, specifically for a new electrical system, switch-gear, chiller, elevator modernization, wiring and
continuous air conditioning.
Commissioner Hansen inquired what the cost estimate would be to build a new nurse's building versus
renovating the existing building.
Mr. LaMont stated that a report done by McDonough Associates which dated back to the late 80' s or
early 90's indicated a price of$50 million.
Commissioner Hansen asked Mr. LaMont to find out if the $50 million was for a new building.
Mr. LaMont stated that he will provide the commissioners with the figures.

Commissioner Hansen moved to adjourn the meeting, seconded by Commissioner Gorman. The
motion carried and the meeting was adjourned.

RESOLUTION

THE HONORABLE JOHN H. STROGER, JR.
PRESIDENT OF THE COOK COUNTY BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS
RECOGNIZING THE UPCOMING SOTH ANN IVERSARY OF THE
BROWN V. BOARD OF EDUCATION OF TOPEKA, KANSAS DECISION
WHEREAS, May 17, 2004, will mark the 50th Anniversary of the landmark Supreme Court decision,
Brown, et al. v. Board ofEducation of Topeka, et al. ; and
WHEREAS, this historic unanimous decision ended federally sanctioned racial segregation in the
nation's public schools, overturning Plessy v. Ferguson and ruling that "separate educational facilities are
inherently unequal". This decision had the added benefit of serving as the impetus to the civil rights
movement of the 1950s and I 960s and spearheading tangible integration in public facilities and
accommodations; and
WHEREAS, the "spark" that ignited the movement was Linda Brown, who was denied admission to her
local elementary school in Topeka, Kansas, because she was black; when her case was combined with
several other cases, the collective body of cases ultimately reach the U.S. Supreme Court; and
WHEREAS, prior to the I 954 ruling, de jure segregation (legally imposed) was a fact of life in the
majority of Southern school systems, with institutions charged with educating African-Americans
routinely spending a mere fraction of the amount allocated to educate white children; and
WHEREAS, the disparity between the educational facilities was great, with black students forced to
endure overcrowded classrooms, inadequate libraries, undertrained teachers and even a lack of indoor
plumbing in the schools; and

552

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDfNGS FOR FEBRUARY 3, 2004

WHEREAS, even though the Supreme Court ruling ushered in a feeling of opt1m1sm, actual
desegregation was not immediate or easily implemented; to use the words "strong societal resistance"
would be a gross understatement. In fact, a second decision, commonly referred to as "Brown II",
established guidelines for ending segregation, but without specific timetables, instead using the vague
language, "with all deliberate speed"; and
WHEREAS, even though the major changes that occurred during the 1950s, 60s and 70s were
tumultuous, this case is considered by many legal scholars to be perhaps the most significant of the last
century; and
WHEREAS, although great strides have been made in our nation since the Brown decision, far too many
individuals take their freedoms and educational opportunities for granted, with little regard for the
countless lives that were lost over the span of the civil rights movement; and
WHEREAS, the County remains committed to protecting the diverse population of those who live, work
and recreate in Cook County from discrimination, bias and bigotry.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that Cook
County Government does hereby acknowledge the upcoming 50th Anniversary of the Supreme Court's
Brown v. Board of Education ruling and urge all residents to take cognizance of the events leading up to
and transpiring after this groundbreaking decision.
Approved and adopted this 3rd day of February 2004.
