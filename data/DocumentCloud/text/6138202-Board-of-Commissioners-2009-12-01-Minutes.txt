BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF COOK COUNTY
PRESIDENT
VETOES
Transmitting a Communication, dated November 23, 2009 from
TODD H. STROGER, President, Cook County Board of Commissioners
Please be advised that, in accordance with the authority granted to me by Section 2-6008 of the Counties
Code, I am exercising my veto authority as President of the Board of Commissioners and hereby veto
Item #2 from the November 17, 2009 Special Meeting wherein the Cook County Board of
Commissioners amended the Home Rule County Retailers’ Occupation Tax reducing the Retailers’
Occupation Tax to one and one-quarter percent (1.25%) effective July 1, 2010. I hereby veto the
amendments passed on November 17, 2009 to the Cook County Home Rule Retailers’ Occupation Tax
(Chapter 74 Taxation, Article IV, Sections 74-150 through 74-152).
To ease the burden on Cook County taxpayers, Cook County has historically worked to do more with less
revenue, particularly in recent years. While the state of Illinois and local municipalities have increased
taxes, Cook County has made a concerted effort to continue to provide services at minimum cost to
residents. Our responsibilities include emergency, in-patient and outpatient care for millions of people in
need; police protection; court and legal services; child custody and adoption services; defense for the
indigent; job training and placement; economic development; real estate services; building and public
health inspections; environmental services and correctional security.

2

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 1, 2009
Those services were deeply threatened in 2007, when it became clear that Cook County could not
continue to offer the same level of services without either increasing revenue or reducing expenses. When
Cook County was confronted with a deficit of over $500 million in 2007, my Administration took the
tough leadership position to institute significant cuts and hold the line on costs. But even with the cuts we
implemented in 2007, Cook County could not continue to provide health and public safety services
without finding a way to increase revenue. Our property tax levy had remained flat at $720 million since
1996 and we had not raised our portion of the sales tax since 1992, when Cook County first instituted a
sales tax of 3/4 of a penny. With revenue flat and costs growing, it was simply not possible to provide the
means for the County’s separately elected officials to fund their operations and pay for mandated services.
There is not a household in Cook County that could pay 2008 bills with 1996 dollars, and neither could
Cook County. That is why my Administration went to the Cook County Commissioners to ask for one
penny more in sales tax revenue to fund essential services.
It’s critical to note that, before taxpayers were asked for one penny more in taxes in 2008, my
Administration made substantial cuts in county government spending – and continued to once again, for
another year, hold the line on the property tax levy for homeowners. After much debate, the majority of
the Board of Commissioners voted to raise the Cook County portion of the sales tax by one penny in
Fiscal Year 2008. This one penny increase was the responsible, though politically difficult, course of
action to take. Because of the difficult decisions my Administration and the Board made in 2007 and
2008, Cook County continues to hold the line on property taxes and has been able to avoid the devastating
deficits that plague so many other governments throughout our region and the nation.
We now confront a period when governments across the region and the country are being compelled to
eliminate desperately needed services because of these deficits. That is not the case in Cook County,
where we continue to have the capacity to meet our obligations because we took the politically
courageous step of increasing our revenue stream to address our structural deficit in 2008.
Now, some members of the Cook County Board of Commissioners seem determined to throw Cook
County in the red by rolling back a portion of the sales tax – a nearsighted action that will force
significant cuts to the County’s health care and public safety systems and negatively affect the people
who need these services the most.
Because of the purposeful timing of the rollback by this group of Commissioners, this reduction in the
sales tax would not be effective until July 1, 2010, and the County will not feel the effects of the reduction
in revenue until October 1, 2010. We will have to confront a shortfall of more than $30 million for 2010 –
and roughly $200 million for 2011, when the bulk of this devastating cut in revenue will be felt.
It’s important to note that sales tax revenues are down across the State of Illinois. When this reality is
compounded by a half-penny rollback in the County’s portion of the sales tax, we can safely project that
the sales tax rollback will force between 10 and 12% reductions in expenses in 2011 – a level of reduction
that will cripple our health care system and other service areas because these agencies will be forced to
bear a disproportionate share of cuts because their funding is not protected by court-ordered and statutory
mandates.
The Board understands that the County cannot sustain a $200 million cut in 2010 – and that is why the
reduction of the sales tax is not being implemented until July 1, 2010, allowing the County Board to
dodge the need to truly address the effects of this reprehensible cut until the 2011 budget is presented.
The Board is effectively taking the easy way out and placing the County’s strong financial position,
services, and solid bond ratings on shaky ground which will only lead to the need for additional revenue
in the near future.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 1, 2009
The Republican side of the aisle has always stood on the proposition not to raise taxes regardless of the
needs of the County. But the Democratic side – the side of the aisle that represents the poorest people in
Cook County, and especially the districts whose residents use our clinic and hospital care the most –
should do their duty and represent the interests of their residents. Instead, we are confronted with the
actions of a handful of individual commissioners who have been willing to put their own political agendas
ahead of their constituents’ needs.
The commissioners who stand with me in wisely opposing this rollback recognize that the principled
position is to use our common sense and put the needs of the people of Cook County who rely on our vital
services ahead of the political fortunes of a handful of commissioners. I cannot and will not support an
action by the Board that will place the County’s finances and service operations at grave risk, nor will I
support a decision that is made without public input or due diligence as to how such a reduction will
effect the County in the future.
While I am vetoing the reductions and amendments to the Retailers’ Occupation Tax, I hereby request
that we monitor our revenues in 2010 in order to determine if revenue projections are being met. We
need to better understand the rate and magnitude of any economic recovery and to address in advance the
cuts that will be required including employee layoffs and service reductions prior to a reduction in the
sales tax.
I stand firm in my commitment to support County services and to provide adequate funding in order to
protect and provide for our County residents. I remain committed to consider reductions in the sales tax.
However, said reductions must only be made at appropriate intervals with a complete understanding of
what the effects of a reduction in revenue will have on County services and government.
While I hereby veto the actions of the Board of Commissioners on November 17, 2009 and veto the
amendments to the Cook County Home Rule Retailers’ Occupation Tax, I ask that we take the fiscally
responsible approach and evaluate the rate of return on the 2010 revenue projections and conduct hearings
showing exactly how a 12% cut would be implemented in 2011 by the Board and the separately elected
office holders. The residents of Cook County should have the opportunity to understand how such a
reduction in the sales tax will affect them and the services provided by Cook County.
In accordance with the authority granted to me by Section 2-6008 of the Counties Code and for the
reasons stated herein, please transmit this veto message on the agenda for the next meeting of the Cook
County Board of Commissioners, December 1, 2009.

A RESOLUTION IN SUPPORT OF THE DREAM ACT IN CONGRESS
AND RIGOBERTO PADILLA
WHEREAS, the people of Cook County and the United States appreciate the contributions of many
immigrants to this nation; and
WHEREAS, the social, political, and economic landscape would be vastly different of such individuals
had not come to this country in search for a better life for their families and themselves; and
WHEREAS, we must work diligently to insure that those in pursuit of such lifestyle are given an
opportunity to achieve such goals; and
WHEREAS, with an undocumented population of over twelve million immigrants, including a half a
million in Illinois, it is imperative that we recognize the urgency to assist the young children in this
population; and
WHEREAS, these children enter the United States with their parents and upon their arrival, many excel
in the classroom, work place, and their respective communities; and
WHEREAS, some choose to continue their educational quest at noted colleges and universities through
out the nation and others choose to serve the country as members of the United States Armed forces; and
WHEREAS, despite their honorable and heroic contributions to their communities, they live in constant
fear of being identified, detained, and possibly deported by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to
a place that has not been their home since they were young children; and

22

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 1, 2009
WHEREAS, on January 18th, 2009 Rigoberto Padilla was confronted with such possibility; and
WHEREAS, after being pulled over for a misdemeanor traffic stop, he was identified as an
undocumented resident, detained at Cook County Jail, and was ordered to be deported by Immigration
and Customs Enforcement 33 days there after; and
WHEREAS, Rigoberto Padilla has been an upstanding resident for the past 15 years he has resided in
Cook County. He completed his studies at Noble Street Charter High School and continued on to Harold
Washington College, with exceptional grades. In addition, he works full time to support his family and
pay for his education at the University of Illinois Chicago, in which he hopes to one day become an
attorney; and
WHEREAS, immigration laws such as the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act
of 1996 must be amended to permit States to determine State residency for higher education purposes and
to authorize the adjustment of status to long-term residing alien students who entered the country as
children, and protect individuals like Rigoberto Padilla; and
WHEREAS, the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act (S. 729), or the DREAM Act,
is the amendment for such act. The DREAM Act has been proposed by Illinois’ own U.S. senator Richard
Durbin to Congress and supports undocumented minors who have acquired a degree from an institution of
higher education, or completed a least two years in good standing, or have served in the uniformed
services for at least two years.
WHEREAS, the passage of such bill will allow places like Cook County to retain the bright and
productive students like Rigoberto Padilla, so they can continue to be instrumental influences to their
family and communities.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners does
hereby endorse our support of the DREAM Act, and call upon the U.S. Department of Homeland Security
to halt the removal of Rigoberto Padilla and other young immigrant students who would be granted the
opportunity to gain legal status under DREAM or other comprehensive immigration reform proposals
while such legislation is under consideration the U.S. Congress;
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a copy of this Resolution be sent to each member of the Illinois
Congressional delegation.
Approved and adopted this 1st day of December 2009.

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
It became apparent that the receiving accounts would need an infusion of funds on August 13,
2009. The account balance on that date was $123,195.00 and was the same 30 days before that.

2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
The 695 - DHSEM Reserve Fund Balance was identified as a funding source because it is the
respective department by which all DHSEM grant reimbursements and credits from prior fiscal
years have been held.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in

None.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
The 695 - DHSEM Reserve Fund Balance is the respective department by which all DHSEM grant
reimbursements and credits from prior fiscal years have been held; there are no items budgeted to
its respective accounts and is solely used to accept and hold all grant reimbursements and credits
from government municipalities (local, state and federal) for the DHSEM.
