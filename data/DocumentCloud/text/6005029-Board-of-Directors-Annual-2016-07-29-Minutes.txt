WHEREAS in July of 2012, Carmen Velasquez was appointed by the President of the Cook County Board of Commissioners,
and confirmed by the Board of Commissioners, to serve as a member of the Board of Directors of the Cook County Health and
Hospitals System; and
WHEREAS, Carmen Velasquez played an integral role in the governance of the Health System, which demands a considerable
time commitment from its volunteer Board members; and
WHEREAS, Carmen Velasquez graciously lent her vast expertise to the Health System by serving as a member of the Health
System Board’s Audit and Compliance Committee from August 2013, and as Chair of the Committee from January 2015
through July 2016, as a member of the Health System Board’s Quality and Patient Safety Committee from August 2012 through
August 2013, as a member of the Health System Board’s Human Resources Committee from August 2013 through December

the five academic medical centers. With more than 130 access points, this extensive network allows CountyCare members the
ability to access care close to their home and within a network of care utilized by their primary care provider. CountyCare has
achieved considerable success providing an unprecedented opportunity for low income adult residents of Cook County to have
access to care. Because of CountyCare and the Affordable Care Act, for the first time in the Health System’s history, there are
more insured patients than uninsured; and
WHEREAS, following the transition of CountyCare from being a Demonstration Project to becoming a County Managed Care
Community Network, which essentially created a new role and function for the Health System in operating a health plan for
the CountyCare members, as Chair of the Health System Board’s Audit and Compliance Committee and as a member of the
Health System Board’s Finance Committee, Carmen Velasquez was intimately involved in ensuring CountyCare’s success;
and
WHEREAS during her tenure with the Health System, Carmen Velasquez earned the genuine respect of her fellow Board
members for her keen insight, attention to detail, and knowledge in the areas of healthcare management, community public
health, and civil and minority rights advocacy; and
WHEREAS the Health System’s leadership team held Carmen Velasquez in high regard and appreciated her strength and
support, as well as her ability to lead with integrity and objectivity.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Directors of the Cook County Health and Hospitals System,
on behalf of the more than five million residents of Cook County served by the Health System, does hereby gratefully
acknowledge Carmen Velasquez for her extraordinary abilities, outstanding leadership and unwavering commitment to the
transformation of the Health System in order to maximize access to quality medical care to all residents of Cook County.

0 Nearly 200 individuals attended the Cook County Health Foundation Associate Board gala on July 9th

and raised almost $18,000 for the Greater Chicago Food Depository?s FRESH trucks program. The FRESH
trucks are mobile, walk?through produce markets, which provide fresh fruit and vegetables to
individuals who do not have access to fresh food. The next Associate Board event is scheduled for
Wednesday, August 3rd (see attached).

To date, Fresh Truck partnership with the Greater Chicago Food Depository has resulted in nine visits
to three community health centers - Logan Square, Cottage Grove, and Robbins. As a result, fresh
fruits and vegetables have been provided to 1163 households which includes 4099 individuals. Most of the
individuals receiving produce screened positive for food insecurity at a health center visit.

In early July, began a pilot Summer Meals program at three health centers Englewood, Cottage
Grove, and Robbins. These sites provide a free and healthy meal for school-aged children during the months
when school is out. Summer Meals program is open to any community member; participants do not
need to be a current patient of the health center.

On June 30, the last day of the state fiscal year, the Illinois House and Senate approved a stopgap budget that
was signed immediately by the Governor, which keeps state government operational for the next six months.
The temporary budget includes a full year of funding for K-12 education that allows public schools to open on
time this fall, funding for state colleges and universities for operations from FY16 and the first half of FY17,
appropriations for capital construction projects, as well as approximately 65% of funding to human service
agencies for work that was already performed in FY16 and work for the first six months of FY17.

While some non-federal Medicaid funding was included in the stopgap budget, an agreed court order will allow
the state to continue to make all Medicaid payments, including payments to Medicaid health plans.

in mid-July, Illinois Comptroller Leslie Munger announced that despite the stopgap budget, the state still faces
significant cash flow issues, estimated to result in a six month wait for some vendors to be paid with the total
amount owed to vendors totaling $10 billion by the end of the year.

The Illinois General Assembly is schedule to return to Springfield for the Fall Veto Session November 15-17, 2016
and November 29-December 1, 2016.

On June 22, 2016 House Speaker Paul Ryan released Better Way?, a plan that addresses six policy
areas. The health care portion ofthe plan includes per-capita caps for Medicaid and allows states that do not
want the cap to implement block grant programs for Medicaid. While the proposal would repeal the ACA,
including the Medicaid expansion, it does maintain some ACA reforms including allowing dependent coverage
until age 26. A key component of the plan is that DSH would not be under the allotment but would be financed
separately and repeals the FY 2018-2020 DSH cuts.

On luly 22, 2016 President Obama signed 5.524, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA) into
law. The bill passed both the House and Senate with strong bi?partisan support. CARA expands prevention and
educational efforts to prevent abuse as well as treat addiction. Among the provisions in the bill is authorization
of $720 million in grants to combat opioid abuse.

The House and Senate are currently working on their respective annual appropriations bills. The full Senate has
not yet taken up their committee passed bill. The House Committee on Appropriations recently released their
Labor?HHS Appropriations bill which was passed by in committee in mid?July. The House Committee on
Appropriations bill contains no funding for ACA programs and is $576 million less than the FY2016 budget for
CMS. Other funding in the House passed bill includes $390 million for Zika and $581 million for opioids.

The House and Senate both passed Zika funding bills which were sent to conference committee. in the
conference, the agreement called for $1.1 billion in funding, but $750 million of that came from other programs
including efforts to fight Ebola. Democrats argued that emergency supplemental funding does not need to be
offset and consequently they did not sign off on the conference agreement. The final conference agreement
passed the House, there were not 60 votes in the Senate to vote for cloture, consequently there was no final
vote on passage in the Senate. As a result, Congress has adiourned without passing Zika funding.

Congress is in recess thru September 5, 2016.

Protection of Medicaid remains a key priority for at both the State and Federal level.
