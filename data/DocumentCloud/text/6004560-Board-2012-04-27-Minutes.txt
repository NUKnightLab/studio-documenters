Board and Committee Reports (continued)
B. Minutes of the Quality and Patient Safety Committee Meeting, April 17, 2012
This item was considered after Items III(C) and IV(A).
Director Ansell, seconded by Director Lyne, moved the approval of the minutes of the
Quality and Patient Safety Committee Meeting of April 17, 2012. THE MOTION
CARRIED.
Director Ansell voted PRESENT on request numbers 3 and 13, regarding proposed
Agreements with Rush
Director Golden voted PRESENT on request numbers 20 and 29, regarding proposed
Agreements with Northshore University
Director Greenspan voted PRESENT on request numbers 1, 4, 15 through 18, 22, 26 and

C. Minutes of the Finance Committee Meeting, April 20, 2012
Director Carvalho noted that on April 20th, the Finance Committee received information but did not take
action on any items, due to the unexpected lack of a quorum; he added that the Office of the General Counsel
is currently working on an amendment to the Rules of the Board which will allow a Board Member who is not
a member of a Committee to temporarily serve on a Committee, for quorum purposes. Chairman Batts and
Directors Butler and Rothstein were in attendance at the Finance Committee Meeting, but were unable to be
part of the quorum, based upon the current Rules. The contractual requests were discussed by the Committee,
and were placed directly on this Board Agenda for consideration, under Item IV(A).
The Board discussed the contracts contained within the minutes (also on this Agenda under Item IV(A)).
Director Ansell inquired regarding request number 4; this was a request to amend, extend and increase the
contract with Health Management Associates (HMA). Dr. Ram Raju, Chief Executive Officer, responded
that HMA has been working with the System on the Section 1115 Waiver activities; these activities include
working with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and working on the preparation of the
documents. At this present time, the System is moving forward as if the Affordable Care Act will go through
and will pass the test through the Supreme Court. Dr. Raju indicated that the System needs some expertise
and assistance in setting up the medical home network; he noted that management has done a great job of it,
but more assistance is needed. He stated that HMA has done a phenomenal job in setting up the same kind of
systems in other places, so the request is to amend the contract to buy that expertise from them for a short
time while this is set up.
Dr. Raju indicated that this amendment will allow for the utilization of assets, on an as-needed basis. He
stated that some of the activities will involve consultation regarding the registries, setting up the medical
home network, and patient care activities. He noted that, at some point during the negotiations with CMS, it
is anticipated that representatives of CMS will be visiting the System, to see how it is performing as a medical
home; the entire Section 1115 Waiver may depend on how effectively the System is able to show CMS that it
is capable of running a medical home network.

Board and Committee Reports
C. Minutes of the Finance Committee Meeting, April 20, 2012 (continued)
Director Rothstein inquired whether System staff will be trained to carry on these activities so that the
contract will not have to be renewed at some point. Dr. Raju stated that it is his intention to do so; however,
work needs to take place in the next six (6) weeks in order to prepare for a visit from the representatives from
CMS.
Director Golden referenced previous discussions regarding a firewall that would be in place, as HMA works
with other organizations that the System considers to be competitors, in terms of getting more out of the
Medicaid population. She asked whether there is any type of conflict of interest, and whether there would
still be a firewall in place, in terms of what Matt Powers, an employee of HMA, is doing. She inquired
whether there were other entities considered, other than HMA, who could have been solicited to work on the
activities relating to the medical home network.
Dr. Raju responded that the System could have gone to other entities, but HMA has been spearheading the
entire Section 1115 Waiver process for some time; HMA has been involved on the regulatory side and in
working with CMS and preparing the documentation. HMA has had a relationship with the System for a long
time; in past experiences, he has found that when two different entities are brought in to do work on the same
principle, they do not typically work well together. Dr. Raju stated that he will review the matter of the
firewall and speak with the General Counsel about it, but the idea is that Matt Powers will run this particular
aspect, directly reporting to him. He added that this request is not for staff augmentation, it is purely for the
utilization of consultation services.
Further discussion took place on the subject of whether the same principals of HMA are or will be performing
the same or similar consulting services for other local healthcare entities besides the System. Dr. Raju
indicated that it is not mutually comparative in the approach; at the present time, no one else in the State of
Illinois is attempting approval of the Section 1115 Waiver, simply because this waiver is for the public
hospital systems, and no other hospital system in the State of Illinois is large enough to carry this forward.
Note: further discussion on the matter relating to HMA took place during the Board’s consideration of the
request under Item IV(A).
Director Carvalho, seconded by Director O’Donnell, moved the approval of the minutes
of the Finance Committee Meeting of April 20, 2012. THE MOTION CARRIED
UNANIMOUSLY.
Several Directors began to state their abstentions regarding contractual matters contained
within the minutes; however, as no action took place by the Finance Committee on those
items contained within the minutes, due to the lack of a quorum, the abstentions were
instead stated when the vote was taken on Item IV(A) later in the meeting, when the same
contractual requests were presented directly for their consideration and approval.

IV.

Action Items
A. Contracts and Procurement Items - reviewed by the Finance Committee on April 20, 2012 (Attachment
#1)
See Item III(C) for additional discussion of these contractual requests.
Director Carvalho, seconded by Director Greenspan, moved the approval of request
numbers 1 through 11, with the exception of request numbers 5, 6 and 7, which were
withdrawn, under the Contracts and Procurement Items.
Following discussion, during which it was determined that request number 4 would be
separated from the motion and would be considered alone, Director Carvalho, seconded
by Director Greenspan, amended the motion to approve request numbers 1 through 3, and
8 through 11. THE MOTION CARRIED.
Director Ansell voted PRESENT on request number 11.
Director Carvalho, seconded by Director Greenspan, moved the approval of request
number 4.
Director Golden indicated that she would not be voting in favor of this request; she stated that she feels that
there may be a conflict. She stated that she knows that HMA has had conversations with the University of
Chicago; she added that she worked very closely with the federally-qualified health centers (FQHCs) on the
south side of Chicago, and HMA was intimately involved in setting up their medical home network. She
stated that it was her understanding that when the System entered into the agreement with HMA, it was for
the purpose of working with Matt Powers, in terms of Medicaid issues. She noted that there may be some
synergy, but she thought that the medical home network setup is separate from the subject of consultation
regarding Medicaid issues; this is an opportunity in which the System could have consulted with other
entities besides HMA who do this type of work.
Director Rothstein expressed concerns similar to those of Director Golden. She inquired how the entities
may be affected if HMA has total control of the system setup, as this is a competitive marketplace. Dr. Raju
responded that the initial part of the Waiver calls for enrolling people who are already clients at the System;
it is expected that one hundred thousand (100,000) people who are in the System today getting care – those
who are receiving care from System physicians, who utilize System pharmacy services, etc. – will be
enrolled.
Director O’Donnell indicated that it is known that HMA consults with many different health care systems;
she noted that they have done a tremendous amount of work for the System on the matter regarding the
Medicaid backlog, and on other issues.
Director Ansell stated that he is supportive of this matter, but indicated that he will be abstaining, because of
the work with which Rush is involved with HMA on a medical home network.
On the motion to approve request number 4, a voice vote was taken and THE MOTION
CARRIED.
Directors Ansell, Carvalho and Lyne voted PRESENT.
Director Golden voted NO.

IV. Action Items (continued)
B. Proposed Academic Affiliation Agreements - reviewed by the Quality and Patient Safety Committee on
April 17, 2012 (Attachment #2)
Dr. John O’Brien, System Chair of Planning, Education and Research, presented the requests for the Board’s
consideration.
Chairman Batts noted that the System appears to be fragmented with regard to affiliations; he inquired
whether that was typical. Director Rothstein responded that it was her experience that it is in the best interest
of the institution to have only one affiliation with one institution; however, she noted that there were times
that the affiliate could not fulfill for a particular service, so those services would be sought from other
institutions.
Director Carvalho stated that, approximately three years ago, there was a question raised about whether the
System was fully reflecting in its cost reports all items for which the System could claim credit. A consulting
firm was hired to go through all of the affiliation agreements to determine the answer to that question. At the
time, one of the questions that he had asked was: as the review activities on these agreements were taking
place, could the Board also receive a report regarding whether the financial terms relating to the agreements
appear favorable to the System? He indicated that he did not think a response was received. He was unsure
whether the Quality and Patient Safety Committee reviews this type of information, or whether the Finance
Committee should review it. He added that, when the System has an agreement with an entity other than the
System’s primary affiliate, the reason for the selection of the entity may be unclear; the selection may be
made because it is in the System’s institutional interest, or it may be driven by some other consideration of
which the Board is unfamiliar, at the department level.
Dr. Raju responded that one of the greatest strengths of the System is the medical educational opportunities it
offers. He stated that most of the medical schools in the area would love to have that experience, so there is
some value in it. He indicated that the issue should be reviewed, with the following three questions in mind:
1) what value does it bring to the education of the System’s residents; 2) what kind of benefit does it bring to
the patients, because it provides state-of-the-art modern medicine; and 3) what are the financial benefits to
this organization? An objective evaluation addressing those three questions needs to be done for every
contract, followed by a determination for action, if necessary. He indicated that, once the Section 1115
Waiver process is over, he plans to take a close look at every affiliation.
Director Rothstein noted that several years ago, when the initial academic questions were raised, a Request
for Proposals (RFP) was sent out to all of the medical schools; the only response received was from Rush.
Additionally, review of the agreements took place many times; at the time of the reviews, it was determined
that the agreements were financially advantageous to the County.
Director Carvalho, seconded by Director Lyne, moved the approval of request numbers 1
through 31 under the Proposed Academic Affiliation Agreements. THE MOTION
CARRIED.
Director Ansell voted PRESENT on request numbers 3 and 23, regarding proposed
Agreements with Rush
Director Golden voted PRESENT on request numbers 20 and 31, regarding proposed
Agreements with Northshore University
Director Greenspan voted PRESENT on request numbers 1, 4, 13, 17, 19 and 25 through
28, regarding proposed Agreements with UIC

Action Items (continued)
C. Any items listed under Sections III, IV and VII
D. Request to execute Interim Occupancy Agreement between the Illinois Medical District Commission
and the County of Cook/Cook County Health and Hospitals System, for the System’s temporary
utilization of property for parking, from the period beginning May 18, 2012 and terminating on May
22, 2012
Director Greenspan, seconded by Director O’Donnell, moved the approval of the request
to execute the Interim Occupancy Agreement.
THE MOTION CARRIED
UNANIMOUSLY.

E. Proposed Resolution – authorizing the Chief Executive Officer to execute non-procurement contracts
(Attachment #3)
Elizabeth Reidy, System General Counsel, introduced the item and provided a brief overview. Some time
ago, this Board passed a resolution allowing the Chief Executive Officer to execute non-procurement
contracts; however, it is unclear whether a contract that does not involve actual expenditure of dollars, but
involves indemnification, should come back to the Board. She stated that, as a matter of policy, these types of
contracts have been brought to the Board. This proposed Resolution essentially allows the Chief Executive
Officer to sign certain indemnification agreements; it also allows the Chief Executive Officer to do certain
emergency preparedness activities. Ms. Reidy added that the proposed Resolution provides for reporting to
the Board of those agreements that the Chief Executive Officer has executed.
Director Rothstein, seconded by Director Lyne, moved the approval of the proposed
Resolution authorizing the Chief Executive Officer to execute non-procurement
contracts. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

V.

Report from Chairman of the Board
Update on Cook County Health Foundation
Chairman Batts stated that he and Dr. Raju recently met with a proposed very large donor. The meeting went
very well; efforts and activities regarding the establishment of the Foundation were related. Chairman Batts and
Dr. Raju are to go back to the proposed donor with a more specific proposal related to the Oak Forest Health
Center, particularly with regard to the specialty clinics, in order to get those up and running faster.

A. Board Education – Emergency Preparedness (Attachment #4)
Dr. Robert Feldman, MD, of the Department of Emergency Medicine at John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook
County, presented an update on Emergency Preparedness. The Board reviewed and discussed the
information.

During his update on recruitment, Dr. Raju introduced Ms. Natalie Stricklin. Ms. Stricklin is an employee who
pursued educational opportunities while working at the System; she is now working as a nurse on the Medical
Surgical Team. Additionally, Dr. Raju recognized Dr. Ronald Lubelchek for his heroic efforts to attend to a
young teen who was electrocuted by the third rail after jumping on a train track; Chairman Batts requested that a
resolution be prepared to present at the next Board Meeting to thank Dr. Lubelchek.
A. Draft Master Plan – Oak Forest Preserve (Attachment #6)
Anna Ashcraft, Director of the Cook County Real Estate Management Division, provided a presentation on
the draft Master Plan for the Oak Forest Preserve. The Board reviewed and discussed the information.

VII. Closed Session Items
A. Discussion of Personnel Matter

RAM RAJU, MD, MBA, FACHE, FACS 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER 
COOK COUNTY HEALTH AND HOSPITALS SYSTEM 
REPORT TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
April 27, 2012 
 
FY 2012 BUDGET 
Weekly meetings with the finance team to discuss the accounts receivable report for the week prior and 
the level of physician billing continue as well as meetings with the State regarding the status of pending 
Medicaid  applications.    Collections  in  March  are  trending  upward  for  all  payers.    Inpatient  delinquent 
unbilled  accounts  reduced  from  $14  million  in  November  2011  to  $3  million  in  April  2012.    This  was 
done  by  establishing  a  multidisciplinary  work  group  that  focused  on  error  resolution,  medical  records 
coding and system issues.  Outpatient unbilled accounts have been reduced by 12% utilizing a separate 
work  group  that  focused  on  system  issues,  billing,  medical  records  coding  and  charge  master 
maintenance.  Physician billing cash collections have exceed $1 million through the end of March 2012.  
Currently,  although  we  are  under  the  budget  projections  for  Medicaid,  we  are  over  the  budget 
projections for Medicare. 
1115 WAIVER 
The 1115 Waiver Steering Committee, which consists of CCHHS and union leadership, continues to meet 
every  week.  This  month  we  had  meetings  with  members  of  the  Illinois  Congressional  Delegation  that 
were  very  supportive  of  our  waiver  application.    On  April  23rd  we  had  another  very  constructive 
conversation with the Centers for Medicaid & Medicare Services.  Very soon we expect to receive the 
review from the other federal agencies, such as the Office of Management and Budget, regarding our 
waiver application.   The planning and education led by Dr. Stephen Stabile at our pilot site at the Vista 
Health Center in Palatine continues to progress.   
 
 

Page 48 of 58

 OAK FOREST HEALTH CENTER 
On April 19, 2012 the Southland Ministerial Health Network monthly meeting was held at the Oak Forest 
Health Center.  The meeting included a presentation on the Health Center capital renovation project as 
well as the Oak Forest Preserve master plan.  The meeting concluded with a tour of the pre‐construction 
site.  I want to thank Apostle Carl White for offering to hold the meeting onsite and for his continued 
support  of  the  transformation  of  the  Oak  Forest  Campus.    The  design  of  the  first  phase  of  the  health 
center has progressed to final signoff.  It has been decided to combine the demolition and construction 
bids into one.  Anna Ashcraft, Director of the Cook County Real Estate Division, will make a presentation 
at today’s meeting regarding the Master Plan for the Oak Forest Preserve.  The master plan furthers the 
commitment to the Oak Forest Campus and the residents of the  southland. 
PUBLIC HEALTH UPDATE 
The Cook County Department of Public Health (CCDPH) held its all staff Education Day on Friday, March 
30,  2012  kicking  off  National  Public  Health  Week  (April  2  –  April  6)  with  the  theme  of  a  “Healthier 
America Begins Today”.  Topics included trainings on Infection Control Practices, Bloodborne Pathogens, 
Customer Service, and Corporate Compliance. Updates were provided on the Accreditation Process and 
the  four  (4)  WePlan  Health  Priorities  of  Cardiovascular  Disease,  Youth  Violence,  Sexually  Transmitted 
Infections/Teen  Pregnancy,  and  Access  to  Care.  CCDPH  is  readying  itself  to  provide  support  to  the 
Chicago  Department  of  Public  Health  during  the  NATO  Event  around  enhanced  surveillance  of 
communicable disease and food and water safety. 
RECRUITMENT UPDATE 
As  I  have  stated  in  many  forums,  recruitment  and  retention  of  our  workforce  is  one  of  my  highest 
priorities.    Over  the  past  few  months  the  CCHHS  Human  Resources  Team,  led  by  Gladys  Lopez  in 
partnership  with  the  Cook  County  Bureau  of  Human  Resources,  has  made  progress  in  the  area  of 
recruiting with a total of 95 positions to date.  I am pleased to announce that 38 of those vacancies filled 
were critical clinical positions of which were 24 nurses.  I would like to share the story of one of our new 
nurses, Natasha Stricklin.  Ms. Stricklin joined the Stroger Hospital team 12 years ago in the Transport 
Department.  During  her  tenure  in  the  Transport  Department  she  attended  Olive  Harvey  College  and 
graduated with an Associates Degree in Nursing on July 31, 2010. Ms. Stricklin is now joining the Stroger 
Nursing Department on the Medical Surgical Team. I would like to acknowledge Natasha's loyalty to the 
organization  and  her  initiative  in  pursuing  educational  opportunities  that  support  the  mission  of  the 
2   P a g e  
 
Page 49 of 58

 Health  System.  We  are  invested  in  her  success  as  a  professional  Registered  Nurse  and  anticipate  that 
she will continue to grow both personally and professionally with the Cook County Health & Hospitals 
System.  
COOK COUNTY WELLNESS PROGRAM 
On  April  3rd  the  Cook  County  Board  approved  a  resolution  sponsored  by  President  Toni  Preckwinkle 
launching  the  Cook  County  Wellness  Program,  specifically  targeted  at  building  a  culture  of  health  and 
fitness among its employees.   Spring into Health! is a worksite health initiative to foster a healthy work 
environment that will ensure employees and families make positive lifestyle choices.   This program will 
utilize a variety of comprehensive, long‐term and preventive health promotion activities to accomplish 
employee  goals.      These  promotion  activities  include  health  education,  screening  programs  and  social 
support  with  a  focus  on  physical  activity,  healthy  eating,  disease  management  and  tobacco  cessation.  
Some of the key initiatives of Spring into Health! include health fairs, know your numbers, and walking 
works.      On  April  18,  2012  Stroger  Hospital  hosted  a  health  fair  which  provided  health  screenings, 
materials, demonstrations, and health information by a diverse array of organizations including CCHHS, 
Blue  Cross  Blue  Shield,  the  American  Heart  Association,  the  American  Cancer  Society  and  Caremark.  
Another  key  component  of  Spring  into  Health!  is  the  Wellness  Council,  convened  by  President 
Preckwinkle to develop comprehensive, long –term and preventative programming, which includes the 
Cook County Health & Hospitals System, the President’s Office, labor, national health organizations, and 
the private sector.   The council will work with stakeholders to establish a core set of indicators that will 
be used to evaluate the success of the County’s regional and worksite program.  The Health System is 
proud  to  participate  in  this  program  and  to  take  part  of  reducing  health  risks,  healthcare  costs, 
absenteeism and workers’ compensation claims. 
RECOGNITION 
It was reported in the Chicago Tribune on March 23rd that a 14 year old boy jumped on the train track at 
the  Medical  Center  Blue  Line  station  on  a  dare  and  was  electrocuted  after  he  touched  the  third  rail. 
What  was  not  reported  is  that  Ron  Lubelchek,  an  Infectious  Disease  doctor  at  Stroger  Hospital  was 
descending the long ramp which leads from Damen Avenue to the train station on his way home from 
work.  When he reached the train station he saw the young man’s body on the third rail.   Dr. Lubelchek 
called  911  and  jumped  onto  the  track  and  tried  to  move  the  young  male.    Feeling  a  small  shock  of 
electricity he waited for the track’s power to be turned off.  In the meantime, he and a nurse stopped an

 incoming train and then when the power was turned off administered CPR.  The young man was brought 
to Stroger Hospital, but, unfortunately he did not make it.   Dr. Lubelchek is to be commended for his 
heroic and selfless actions.  This behavior is indicative of dedication and valor of Dr. Ron Lubelchek. 
I would like to share with you a letter of appreciation regarding the care of a patient at Stroger Hospital.  
The family wrote that during the treatment the patient received very good care; that the doctors and 
nurses were kind, dedicated to their work, and worked well as a team.  The family further stated that 
the  staff  followed  the  World  Health  Organization  definition  of  health  by  taking  care  of  the  physical, 
social,  mental  and  spiritual  needs  of  the  patient.    The  family  then  thanked  the  following  staff  for  the 
great service they provided:  Cardiac Cath Lab ‐ Kenneth, Maria, Regina, Agnes, Charlee, Chalinee; ICU ‐ 
Jim, Shirley, Shrieja, Anna, Mary, Yemmi, Julie; MICC – Ansy, Barbara, Michael; ER Observation – Meera, 
Tucky, Rajini; and Doctors – Dr. Payman, Dr. Keerthi, Dr. Ibrahim, Dr. Ansari, Dr. Yadav, Dr. Sushma and 
Dr. Ahamad, Dr. Nancy and Dr. Samuel.   
Also, as a follow up to the Doctors Day celebration on March 30th, Dr. David Goldberg was selected as 
Doctor  of  the  Year.    All  his  colleagues  agree  that  Dr.  Goldberg  was  truly  deserving  of  this  award  and 
entirely  appropriate  to  be  the  first  recipient  of  what  will  now  be  an  annual  event.    We  thank  Dr. 
Goldberg  for  his  exemplary  service  and  dedication  to  our  patients  and  the  mission  of  your  health 
system.
