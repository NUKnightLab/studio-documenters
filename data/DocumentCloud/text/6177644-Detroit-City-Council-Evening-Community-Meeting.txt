RE: RECOMMENDATION FOR DEFERRAL

In response to the request for a deferral of the demolition order on the property noted above, the Buildings, Safety Engineering and
Environmental Department (BSEED) submits the following information:

A special inspection conducted on April 30, 2019 revealed that the building is secured and appears to be sound and repairable. The owner
has paid all taxes and is current. The proposed use of the property is owner?s use and occupancy. This is the 1St deferral request for this
property.

Therefore, we respectfully recommended that the demolition order be deferred for a period of six months subject to the following
conditions:

1. A permit for rehabilitation work shall be applied for within t_ell_ (10) business days from the date of the City Council
decision.
2. BSEED will schedule a Progress InSpection within forty-?ve (45) calendar days from the date of the rehabilitation

permit to determine whether substantial progress has been made. Thereafter, the owner must submit to BSEED
detailed inspection reports, with photos showing evidence of the work completed, every (45) calendar
days, for the duration of the rehabilitation work, to demonstrate that substantial progress has been made during
the approved time frame for rehabilitation.

3. The building shall have all imminently hazardous conditions immediately corrected, be maintained, and securely
barricaded until rehabilitation is complete. Rehabilitation work is to be completed within six (6) months, at which
time the owner will obtain one of the following from this department:

0 Certi?cate of Acceptance related to building permits
0 Certi?cate of Approval as a result of a Housing Inspection
0 Certi?cate of Compliance, required for 93 rental properties

4. The owner shall not occupy or allow occupancy of the structure without a certi?cate (as outlined above).
5. The yards shall be maintained clear of overgrown vegetation, weeds, junk and debris at all times.
6. Prior to seeking a permit extension, the owner must contact BSEED and request to extend the deferral period.

We recommend that utility disconnect actions cease to allow the progress of the rehabilitation.

At the end of the deferral period, the owner must contact this department to arrange an inspection to evidence that conditions of the deferral
have been satis?ed and that there has been substantial progress toward rehabilitation. If the building becomes open to trespass or if conditions
of the deferral are not followed, the deferral may be rescinded by the City Council at any time and we may proceed with demolition without

Address: 6760 St Mary?s
Name: Associates, Inc.
Demolition Ordered: August 3, 2018
Deferral Date: October 11, 2018

The building at the location listed above was ordered demolished by your Honorable Body on
the date indicated above and the order was deferred under the conditions of the Ordinance.

A recent inspection on May 8, 2019 has revealed that the building is open to trespass, and/or
required progress has not been made, contrary to conditions of the deferral.

Therefore, we respectfully recommend that the deferral be rescinded and the demolition
proceed as originally ordered, with the cost of demolition assessed against the property.

Respectfully submitted,

Detroit City Council District 1

RE: Request {in Additional Bus Shelters and Sea ting in District 1

My of?ce recently received a message from a constituent via our acebook page who noted that the bus stops along
the Green?eld and Puritan Worth Eastside and West Southside of Green?eld) area currently do not have seating
or shelters. As a result of the bus stops missing seating, residents indicated that they have had to bring their own
lawn or beach chairs to avoid standing for long periods of time while they wait for the buses to arrive. The goal in
our of?ce is to encourage residents to utilize our public transportation system when possible but lack of seating at
various locations has challenged our ability to convince a number of constituents to ride DDOT. Therefore, I am
respectfully requesting that the Detroit Department of Transportation look into the possibility of adding additional
seating and shelters for the bus stops currently in District 1.

Please contact my of?ce for any additional questions or require additional information. Feel free to reach out to my
communications manager, lesha Mitchell, directly by email at i mign'v or via telephone at 313?224?
2941. Thank you for your assistance and I look forward to your response.
