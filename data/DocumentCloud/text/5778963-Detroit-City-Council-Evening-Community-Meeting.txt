The City of Detroit seeks to develop a Citywide Transportation Plan [the Plan) that
provides the roadmap for not only how Detroiters get around, but how city streets
can continue to support the City's advancement. This effort will be led by the
Department of Public Works, with support from the Planning and Development
Department. the Department of Transportation, the Municipal Parking Department.
and the Mayor?s Of?ce The process will be done In collaboration with state. county
and regional partners. The end deliverable of this process must serve as a living
guide toward future infrastructure investment and transportation development
that: 1) has overarching principles of equity, dignity, and transparency. 2] addresses
critical safety issues. 3] improves people's health and neighborhood air quality, 4]
increases the number of realisdc mobility options, and 5) strengthens the
neighborhoods and advances economic opportunity through capital investments.

The Transportation Plan will implement key strategies identi?ed in the recently
published Strategic Transportation Plan and work from the framework created in
the Downtown Transportation Study; collect and analyze new and existing data to
inform and develop transportation policy and programs; and engage the public in
the planning of Detroit's Transportation initiatives. Consultants are being asked to
present the City with a scope of work that achieves the following:

Key initiatives include:

0 Improve Safety Detroit?s annual vehicle crashes totaled 22,833 in
2015. an average of one crash for every 30 residents. The Plan will
guide investment and development priorities to achieve safer
infrastructure.

1- Build safety analysis and toolkit for integration into routine
transportation capital projects. Le. Resurfacing Program

I identify and develop a metrics drivon approach to prioritize
safety improvements for each type of travel mode, including
walk. bike, vehicular, and transit.

Develop protocols to prioritize traf?c calming initiatives and
an implementation process for various types of roadway
classi?cations within the City of Detroit. including non-City
owned roadways in coordination with regional multi-modal
plans and networks.

0 Support Walking, Biking and Transit Everyone deserves the right

The challenge of mobility in Detroit goes beyond traf?c congestion.
Many negative societal outcomes are due the lack of ability to get to a
destination. The plan will identify ways to make it easier and more
affordable for Detrolters to get around. from improvements to
traditional ?xed route transit to integrating new solutions. such as
mobility hubs and microtransit.

Develop a series of policies. programs and potential funding
streams for creating safer streets for pedestrians. encouraging
walking. and creating places for people on Detroit's streets and
transit infrastructure.

identify gaps and barriers in the pedestrian network and
recommend solutions [lack of sidewalk, crossing opportunities
etc].

Establish a set of guidelines for identifying intersections and
segments that need a crosswalk. hawk, signage and/or
pedestrian signal improvement and an implementation
methodology (scenarios in which treatments should be used).
Develop methodology for prioritizing sidewalk repair based on
pedestrian demand, density. ADA compliance and areas of
growth and special uses such as schools, libraries, etc.

Update and incorporate the bicycle master plan into the Plan,
fully ?esh out the city's bicycle lane standards, provide a
recommendation for an overall set of standards, and develop
an implementation strategy.

Update and incorporate the greenways plan into the Plan to
ensure connections to retail nodes and major destinations.
such as parks, and develop standards for various types of
greenways.

Recommend planning for transit network gaps through
coordination with including crosstown connections and
?rst] last mile gaps and identify solutions.

Develop standards for transit supportive infrastructure, such
as ?oating bus islands, transit signal priority locations, and
enhance bus stops. Work with DDOT to plan infrastructure
improvements for their identi?ed 10 high frequency corridors.

- Review and provide recommendations for local mobility

0 Design Streets for Everyone Heart disease is the leading cause of
death for Detroit residents. Detroit's right of ways represent more
than 65 percent of the publicly held open space in the city. The Plan
will introduce more opportunities to walk and bike citywide,
increasing healthy choices for active commutes [complete streets)
and access to recreational activity. it will also improve neighborhood
air quality [speci?cally in freight movement, with Detroit being one of
the busiest trade crossings) and reduce our carbon footprint.

Approximately 40 percent of Detroit's residents live below the
poverty line and 26 percent of Detroiters lack access to a personally-
owned vehicle. The Plan will set targets to establish a policy of
greater access to economic opportunity by increasing travel options
and coordinating modes, empowering all residents with a viable
mobility system to increase better access to Jobs. core services and
amenities.

Develop and implements complete streets policy for adoption
within the City of Detroit.
