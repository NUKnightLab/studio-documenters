PROPOSED ORDINANCE

An Ordinance Amending the Definition of Building Height
(Proposed Ordinance Amendment)
Whereas, the definition of building height in the Cook County Building Ordinance is ambiguous
and contradictory on the issue of measuring height in the absence of curbs; and
Whereas, due to this oversight significant grade changes have become an ongoing problem in
unincorporated Cook County going forth relatively unfettered by County Ordinance; and
Whereas, a small change in the definition of building height will address this contradictory language
by clarifying the manner in which building height is measured when there is no curb present; and
NOW THEREFORE BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that the
Cook County Building Code be ame nded as follows:
Building Code
Article II
Page JOA

Building Height: is the vertical distance measured from the curb level or its equivalent opposite the
center of the front of the building, to the highest point of the under side of the ceiling beams in the case of
a flat roof; to the deck line of a mansard roof; and the mean level of the under side of the rafters between
the eaves and the ridge of a gable, hip, shed, gambrel, or any other pitched roof. Where no curb level has
been established the height of a building shall be measured from the mean elevation of the fiAished
existing lot grade at the front of the building.

Commissioner Hansen, seconded by Commissioner Lechowicz, moved to suspend the rules so that this
matter may be considered. The motion carried unanimously.
Commissioner Goslin, seconded by Commissioner Silvestri, moved that the Proposed Ordinance be
referred to the Committee on Zoning and Building. (Comm. No. 239540). The motion carried

Section 200.0 Purpose
This Ordinance is enacted pursuant to the home rule powers granted to the County of Cook by Article 7,
section 6(a) of the 1970 Illinois Constitution. The purpose of this Ordinance is to maintain this County's
eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program; to minimize potentia l losses due to periodic flooding
including loss of life, loss of property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
government services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairme nt of
the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare; and to preserve
and enhance the quality of surface waters, conserve economic and natural values and provide for the wise
utilization of water and related land resources. This Ordinance is adopted in order to accomplish the
following specific purposes:
200. I

To meet the requirements of 615 ILCS 5/ 18g Rivers, Lakes and Streams Act.

200.2

To assure that new development does not increase the flood or drainage hazards to others, or
create unstable conditions susceptible to erosion;

200.3

To protect new buildings and major improvements to buildings from flood damage;

200.4

To protect human life and health from the hazards of flooding;

200.5

To lessen the burden on the taxpayer for flood control projects, repairs to flood-damaged public
facilities and utilities, and flood rescue and relief operations;

200.6

To make federally subsidized flood insurance available for property in the County by fulfilling
the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program;

200.7

To comply with the rules and regulations of the National Flood Insurance Program codified as 44
CFR 59-79, as amended.

200.8

To protect, conserve, and promote the orderly development of land and water resources; and

200.9

To preserve the natural characteristics a nd functions of watercourses and floodplains in order to
moderate flood and stormwater impacts, improve water quality, reduce soil erosion, protect
aquatic and riparian habitat, provide recreational opportunities, provide aesthetic benefits and
enhance community and economic development.

Section 300.0 Definitions
For the purposes of this Ordinance, the following definitions are adopted :

 JO URNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 2, 2000
300.4

"Base Flood" The flood having a one-percent probability of being equale d or exceeded in any
given year. The base flood is also known as the I 00-year frequency flood event. Application of
the base flood elevation at any location is as defined in Section 600.0 of this Ordinance.

300.5

"Building" A structure that is principally above ground and is enclosed by walls and a roof. The
term includes a gas or liquid storage tank, a manufactured home, mobile ho me or a prefabricated
building. This term also includes recreational vehic les and travel trailers to be installed on a site
for more than 180 days, unless fully licensed and ready for highway use.

300.6

"Channel" Any river, stream, creek, brook, branch, natural or artificial depression, ponded area,
flowage, sloug h, ditch, conduit, culvert, gully , ravine, wash, or natural or man-made

groundwater flows, either perennially or intermittently or seasonally.

300. 7

"Channel Modification" Alteration of a channel by changing the physical dimens ions or materials
of its bed or banks. Channel modification includes damming, rip-rapping (or other armoring),
widening, heightening, deepening, straightening, relocating, lining and s ignificant removal of
native vegetation from the bottom or banks. Channe l modification does not include the clearing
of dead or dyi ng vegetation, debris, or trash from the channel. Channelization is a severe form of

Flood proofing activities to protect previo usly existing lawful structures includ ing the
construction of water tight window wells, elevating structures, or construction of floodwalls
around residential, commercial or industrial principal structures where the outs ide toe of the
floodwall shall be no more than ten (I 0) feet away from the exterior wall of the existing
structure, and, which are not considered substantial improvements to the structure;

(h)

In the case of damaged or replacement buildings, reconstruction or repairs made to a
building that are valued at less than 50 percent of the market value of the building before it
was damaged or replaced, and which does not increase the outside dimensions of the
building.

802.2

Appropriate uses do not include the construction or placement of any new structures, fill, building
additions, buildings on stilts, excavation or channel modifications done to accommodate
otherwise non-appropriate uses in the floodway, fencing (including landscaping or planting
designed to act as a fence) and storage of materials except as specifically defined above as an
Appropriate Use.

802.3

Within the designated floodway as identified on the floodway maps designated by IDNR/OWR,
the construction of an Appropriate Use, will be cons idered permissible provided that the proposed
project meets the following engineering and mitigation criteria and is so stated in writing with
supporting plans, calculations and data by a registered professional engineer and provided that
any structure meets the protection requirements of Section 1000.0 ofthis Ordinance:
1

(a)

Preservation of Flood Conveyance, so as Not to Increase Flood Stages Upstream. For
appropriate uses other than bridge or culvert crossings, on-stream structures or dams, all
effective des ignated floodway conveyance lost due to the project will be replaced for all
flood events up to and including the I 00-year frequency flood. In calculating effective
designated tloodway conveyance, the following factors shall be taken into consideration:
Designated floodway conveyance, "K" = (I .486/n)(AR 213) where "n" is Manning's
roughness factor, "A" is the effective flow area of the cross-section, and "R" is the
ratio of the area to the wetted perimeter. (See Open Channel Hydraulics, Ven Te
Chow, 1959, McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York).
11 .

The same Manning's "n" value shall be used for both existing and proposed conditions
unless a recorded maintenance agreement with a federal, state, or local unit of
government can assure the proposed conditions will be maintained or the land cover is
changing from a vegetative to a non-vegetative land cover.

111.

Transition sections shall be provided and used in calculations of effective designated
floodway conveyance. The following expansion and contraction ratios shall be used
unless an applicant's engineer can prove to IDNR/OWR through engineering
calculations or model tests that more abrupt transit ions may be used with the same
efficiency:
(I)

When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider section, the water s hould
be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one foot horizontal for every four
feet of the flooded stream's length.

3386

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR N OVEMBER 2, 2000

(b)

(c)

(2)

When water is flowi ng from a wide section to a narrow section, the water shou ld
be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of one foot horizonta I fo r every
one foot of the flooded stream's length.

(3)

When expanding or contracting flows in a vertica l direction, a minimum of one
foot vertical transition for every ten feet of stream length shall be used.

(4)

Trans ition sections shall be provided between cross-sections with rapid
expans ions and contractions and when meeting the des ignated floodway
delineation on adjacent properties.

(5)

All cross-sections used in the calculations shall be located perpendicular to flood
flows.

Preservation of Floodway Storage so as Not to Increase Downstream Flooding.
1.

Compensatory storage shall be provided for any designated floodway storage lost due
to the proposed work from the volume of fill or structures placed and the impact of
any related flood control projects.

11.

Compensatory storage for fill or structures shall be equa l to at least 1.5 times the
volume of floodplain storage lost.

111.

Artificially created storage lost due to a reduction in head loss behind a bridge shall
not be required to be replaced.

1v.

T he compensatory des ignated floodway storage shall be placed between the proposed
normal water elevation and the proposed I 00-year flood elevation. All designated
floodway storage lost below the existing I 0-year flood e levation shall be replaced
below the proposed I 0-year flood elevation. All designated floodway storage lost
above the existing I 0-year flood elevation shall be replaced above the proposed
I 0-year flood elevation. All such excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and
open ly to the watercourse.

v.

If the compensatory storage w ill not be placed at the location of the proposed
construction, the applicant's engineer sha ll demonstrate to IDNR/OWR through a
determinatio n of flood discharges and water surface elevations that the compensatory
storage is hydraulically equi vale nt.

v1.

There shall be no reduction in floodway surface area as a result of a floodway
modification, unless such mod ification is necessary to reduce flooding at ex isting
structure.

Preservation of Floodway Velocities so as Not to Increase Stream Erosion or Flood
Heights.

i.

For all Appropriate Uses, except bridges or culverts o r on stream structures, the
proposed work wi ll not result in an increase in the average channel or designated
floodway velocities or stage for all flood events up to and including the I 00-year
frequency event.

be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one foot horizontal for every four
feet of the flooded stream's length;
(2) When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow section, the water should
be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of one foot horizontal for every
one foot of the flooded stream's length;
(3) When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical direction, a minimum of one

with Jess impact to the natural conditions of the body of water affected. Possible
alternatives include levees, bank stabilization, flood proofing of existing structures,
removal of structures from the floodplain , clearing the channel, high flow channe l, or
the establishment of a stream side buffer strip or green belt. C hanne l modification is
acceptable if the purpose is to restore natural conditions and improve water quality
and fish and wildlife habitat;

ii.

Water quality, habitat, and other natural functions would be significant ly improved by
the modification and no s ignificant habitat area may be destroyed, or the impacts are
offset by the replacement of an equivalent degree of natural resource values;

will minimize its adverse impacts on the natural conditions of the body of water
affected, consistent with the following criteria:

(I) The physical characteristics of the modified channel shall match as close ly as
possible those of the ex isting channel in length, cross-section, slope and
meander. If the existing channel has been previously modified, resto ration of
more natural physical conditions should be incorporated into channel
modification design, where practical.
(2) Hydraulically effective transitions shall be provided at both the upstream and
downstream ends of the project, designed such that they will prevent erosion.

3390

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 2, 2000
(3) O ne-sided construction of a channel shall be used when feasible. Removal of
streams ide (riparian) vegetation should be limited to one s ide of the channel,
where possible, to preserve the shading and stabilization effects of the
vegetation.
( 4) C learing of stabilizing vegetation shall be limited to that which is essential for
construction of the channel.
(5) Channel banks shall be constructed with a side slope no steeper than 3: I
horizonta l to vertical, wherever practicable. Native vegetation and gradual side
slopes a re the preferred methods for bank stabilization. Whe re high velocities or
sharp bends necessitate the use of alternative stabilization measures, soil
bioengineering techniques, natural rock or rip-rap are preferred approaches.
Artificial materials such as concrete, gabions, or construction rubble should be
avoided unless there are no practicable alternati ves.
(6) All disturbed areas associated with the modification shall be seeded or otherwise
stabilized as soon as poss ible upon completion of construction. Erosion blanket
or an equivalent material shall be required to sta bilize disturbed channel banks
prior to establishment of the vegetative cover.
(7) If the existing channel contains considerable bottom divers ity such as deep
pools, riffles, and other similar features, such features shall be provided in the
new channel. Spawning and nesting areas and flow characteristics compatible
with fi sh habitat s hall a lso be established, whe re appropriate.
(8) A sediment bas in shall be installed at the downstream end of the mod ification to
reduce sedimentation and degradation of downstream water qua lity.
(9) New or relocated channels should be built in the dry and a ll items of
construction, including vegetation, should be completed prior to diversion of
water into the new channel.

( 10) There s ha ll be no increases in stage or velocity as the channel enters or leaves
the project site for any frequency fl ood unless necessitated by a public flood
control project or unless such an increase is justified as part of a habitat
improvement or erosion control project.
( 11 ) Unless the modification is for a public fl ood control project, there shall be no
reduction in the volume of floodwater storage outs ide the floodway as a resu lt of
the modification; and
