Report on CountyCare Health Plan (continued)
During the discussion of the data regarding membership on slide 4, Mr. Glass provided information
explaining why membership is lower than what was budgeted. He indicated that the implementation of the
choice process for the Family Health Plan (FHP) population was delayed; the State was under a plan to start
implementing the choice process for FHP members in July - it actually got implemented in September, so
CCHHS is a little bit behind budget simply because the State was behind. The Committee should see a
catch-up to the projected budget numbers sometime around May. It was noted that the membership figure of
124,000 is specific to the budgeted number of members for the month of December; Board Chairman
Hammock suggested that the heading for that data reflect that information, so it is clearer that the number is
not one fixed projection for the year.
Chairman Lerner stated that, perhaps for the next meeting, which will have a deeper drill-down on Managed
Care, the presentation could have a slide on a going-forward basis that lays out the direction of membership
and how that compares to the budget comparisons.
During the review of the information on slide 5, regarding membership comparisons, the Committee
discussed the differences in net member change between CountyCare and the two larger plans listed; under
the “fair share” distribution that is supposed to take place with auto-assignments, it was not clear how
CountyCare could have a net decrease while the two larger plans enjoyed significant increases in members
for the month of December. Additionally, it was noted that the two larger plans had been suspended from
receiving new members through auto-assignment for a short time, but the suspensions were recently lifted;
Mr. Glass noted that the impact of the suspensions that occurred in December would likely not be seen until
February. He stated that the administration is actively working to address the issue and resolve the question
relating to the December membership comparison.
Board Chairman Hammock encouraged the
administration to escalate this issue to the highest levels to reach the answer.
In response to the question regarding whether the administration has met with the individuals representing
the new administration at the State, Dr. John Jay Shannon, Chief Executive Officer, stated that there is a
meeting planned in March; he noted that there has been significant focus on not only the transition relating to
the administration but also on the State’s budget. Chairman Lerner suggested that this subject be placed on
the agenda for the March Managed Care Committee Meeting and Board Meeting.
With regard to the information on slide 7, Board Chairman Hammock inquired whether the Plan can dictate
that members only use the CCHHS pharmacy; additionally, he inquired whether the Plan can require that
members pay a co-pay if they do not use the CCHHS pharmacy. Mr. Glass responded that both are options
that are available. He noted that, in the upcoming months, there will come a time when it is no longer
voluntary; rather; the Plan will deny any kind of prescription fill for these medications at any pharmacy other
than CCHHS’ pharmacy. With regard to co-pays, to date, Mr. Glass stated that the administration has taken
the position of not having any co-pays for services; that was established under the Waiver. He added that it
is certainly a strategic question that could be explored. He was unsure about the limits of the amount that can
be charged for co-pays; he stated that it may be limited to the Medicaid level of co-pays, which he believes is
$3.00 per prescription.
Mr. Glass stated that the administration has informed leadership at the Ruth M. Rothstein CORE Center of
Cook County that members have another 60 days maximum before the mandate regarding filling
prescriptions at the CCHHS pharmacy kicks in. He noted that care needs to be taken to avoid any potential
disruption of care or gap in receiving HIV medications for members. Chairman Lerner stated that, for the
March Board Meeting, the measures regarding HIV patient medications and mail order medications on slide
7 should be included in the drill-down. Additionally, Director Junge requested that information on possible
reasons why members are not using the CCHHS pharmacy be provided.
