Report from Chief of Human Resources (Attachment #1)
Gladys Lopez, Chief of Human Resources, presented her report, which included information on the following
subjects: FY2014 Posting Activity; Comparison of Vacancies Filled - FY2013-FY2014; Breakdown of Vacancies
Filled – FY2014 (Internal and External); 2014 Vacancies and Separations; FY2014 Separations by Reason; and
Labor Relations. The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
During the discussion of the information on FY2014 Internal and External Vacancies Filled, a question was raised
regarding the categories of nursing positions that are being filled. Ms. Lopez stated that the categories include
Clinical Nurse I, Clinical Nurse II, Nurse Coordinators, Advanced Practice Nurses and Clinical Case Managers;
she noted that the total does not include Licensed Practice Nurses.
Ms. Lopez stated that the difficulties experienced in filling nursing vacancies are due to the internal process. She
stated that external candidates are in the wings waiting while internal candidates keep moving around, transferring
and taking these vacancies. She noted that it literally takes up to four (4) months to get to the external candidates.
Director Velasquez inquired whether the System has a policy regarding the recruitment of registered nurses with
four-year degrees. Ms. Lopez responded that, currently, the minimum requirement for nurses is a bachelor’s
degree; however, she noted that there are nurses who have been employed at the System for a long period of time
that do not have bachelor’s degrees. Chairman Wiese inquired as to the reason why the System does not recruit
nurses with associate degrees; she asked whether this was a union policy. Ms. Lopez responded that the minimum
requirements are included in the job descriptions for these vacancies; the administration would have to work with
the union if it wanted to change the minimum qualifications. Chairman Wiese requested that the administration

Report from Chief of Human Resources (continued)
revisit the issue and look at the possibility of recruiting associate degree nurses. Dr. John Jay Shannon, Chief
Executive Officer, stated that the Executive Director of Nursing, Agnes Therady, was unable to attend this
meeting, as she is currently attending a negotiations meeting with representatives of the National Nurses
Organizing Committee (NNOC). As this is a complex question, he stated that he preferred to have that discussion
with Ms. Therady present, so she can provide additional information about strategy, professionalism requirements
and changing trends in nursing practice. He requested that Ms. Therady and Ms. Lopez provide an update to the
Board on that subject1.
With regard to the subject of separations, a request was made for a comparison between 2013 and 2014 of
separations due to retirement and resignations that also breaks out the information by category of position2.
Dr. Shannon stated that nursing staff is almost one-third (1/3) of the System’s budgeted positions, and there is
good reason to believe that probably one-third (1/3) of the separations in the past year are related to the nursing
personnel. He stated that the administration plans to bring back that detailed analysis in the future. He referenced
a request that Board Chairman Hammock has made for the development of an organizational dashboard; examples
of measures that would be included on an organizational dashboard that are related to Human Resources would
include time to fill, separation rates and reasons for separation.
Ms. Lopez noted that the online exit interview website is up and running. Those individuals leaving the System
are given a link to the website that allows them to answer questions and provide feedback as to the reason for their
separation. Unfortunately, the response rate has been low, so staff is working to address that; she added that only
two (2) responses have been received for the month of October.
In response to a question regarding whether the System conducts face-to-face exit interviews with outgoing staff,
Ms. Lopez responded in the negative. She stated that generally, the Human Resources Department is not always
informed by the hiring manager or the exiting employee when the employee is leaving the organization. She
stated that staff are working to address that; they are compiling a “Manager 101” training to provide information
on how critical it is that Human Resources be notified in a timely fashion, so that data can be accurate and people
are properly exited out of the System. Ms. Lopez added that, with the new web-based Human Resources system,
the administration is hoping to have additional fields created so that type of information can be added and reports
can be generated. Chairman Wiese noted that this subject impacts the posting and hiring process - if the
administration is informed ahead of time that an employee will be separating, that would give them some extra
time in preparing for the transition of that position.
In response to a question regarding whether goals and benchmarks exist in terms of the number of vacancies that
the Human Resources Department would like to fill each month, Ms. Lopez stated that she and her staff are
working with the budget team to compile a hiring plan; this involves providing the vacancies for the fiscal year to
the hiring manager/department head and asking them to provide their plan of when these positions need to be
filled.
Dr. Shannon stated that, as has been previously mentioned, the administration has internally set an expectation
that the System would reduce its vacancies down to 850 by the end of this fiscal year, and to 600 by the end of the
next fiscal year. There is a huge challenge inherent in the second number, because a greater number of
separations are anticipated in the upcoming year if pension reform becomes a reality. Additionally, the
administration is working to ensure that the System is a flexible, responsive organization that is hiring to meet the
needs of its patient population.
Chairman Wiese requested that the Committee receive information on the actual titles of the positions being hired
and their salaries3. Ms. Lopez responded affirmatively.
