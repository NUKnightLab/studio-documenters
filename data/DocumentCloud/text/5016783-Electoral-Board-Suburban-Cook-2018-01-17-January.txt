PROPOSED RESOLUTION
TO ADOPT THE GOOD FOOD PURCHASING POLICY
WHEREAS, Cook County strives to improve the health of all its residents through services and policies
that promote health and well-being; and
WHEREAS, The Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning (CMAP) recommended the creation of
sustainable local food systems in its Go To 2040 Comprehensive Regional Plan; and
WHEREAS, The Cook County Commission on Social Innovation, through its internal procedure reviewed,
and now recommends, the adoption of a Good Food Purchasing Policy; and
WHEREAS, The Cook County Commission on Social Innovation found that sustainable food is
ecologically sound, economically viable, and socially responsible; and
WHEREAS, The Cook County Commission on Social Innovation found that the health and well-being of
residents can be supported by the creation of a sustainable local food system; and
WHEREAS, Cook County strives to promote safe, healthy and fair work environments for its workforce;
and
WHEREAS, The Good Food Purchasing Program (GFPP) was developed in 2012 to encourage public
institutions to procure food produced through values-driven purchasing standards and to support successful
implementation through technical assistance and verification; and
WHEREAS, Good Food is defined by GFPP as food that is healthy, local, fair, sustainable and humane,
with foods that meet the dietary guidelines for Americans, provide freedom from chronic ailment and are
delicious and safe, and where participating food suppliers are evaluated and held accountable for ensuring
fair compensation and fair treatment of their workers, and that those workers are free of exploitation, and
where Good Food is available to purchase for all income levels and high-quality food is equitable and
physically and culturally accessible to all, and where food is produced, processed, distributed, and recycled
locally using the principles of environmental stewardship (in terms of water, soil, and pesticide
management); and
WHEREAS, Good Food values prioritize nutrition, affordability, geography, and sustainable production
practices including sound environmental practices, fair prices for producers, safe and fair working
conditions for employees, and humane conditions for animals; and
WHEREAS, Good Food purchasing refers to the sourcing and purchasing of foods and beverages, and
food and beverage service contracts, procured by County Departments and Agencies; and

 WHEREAS, In participating in the Good Food Purchasing Program, Cook County will help support a
regional food system that is ecologically sound, economically viable and socially responsible, and will have
an impact on the availability of local, sustainable food; and
WHEREAS, There exists in the food and composting industries limited diversity in the ownership,
production and distribution channels; and
WHEREAS, People with arrest and conviction records face significant employment challenges; and
WHEREAS, There is a need to preserve urban and peri-urban farm land with equitable minority
community ownership and control; and
WHEREAS, There are significant barriers to entry into the food industry at the ownership level, including
access to capital and information, expertise and relationships, resulting in a need for capacity building for
disadvantaged and under-capitalized businesses; and
WHEREAS, There are a number of tax credits available at the federal, state, county and city level to
incentivize investment in distressed communities and to hire very low- income employees, employees with
past criminal records, etc.; and
WHEREAS, It is recognized that the significant buying power of public institutions across the country can
reform the food system, create opportunities for smaller farmers and low-income entrepreneurs of color to
thrive, provide just compensation and fair treatment for food chain workers, support sustainable farming
practices, reward good environmental stewardship including limiting food waste and increasing
composting, and increase access to fresh and healthy foods; and
NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, That Cook County embrace the Good Food Purchasing
Program (GFPP) as a strategy to help improve our region’s food system through the adoption and
implementation of the Good Food Purchasing Standards, which emphasize the following values:
1.

Local Economies - support small and mid-sized agricultural and food processing operations within
the local area or region.

2.

Environmental Sustainability - support producers that employ sustainable production systems that
reduce or eliminate synthetic pesticides and fertilizers; avoid the use of hormones, antibiotics, and
genetic engineering; conserve soil and water; protect and enhance wildlife habitat and biodiversity;
and reduce on-farm energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.

3.

Valued Workforce - provide safe and healthy working conditions and fair compensation for all food
chain workers and producers from production to consumption

4.

Animal Welfare - provide healthy and humane care for farm animals.

5.

Nutritional - promote health and well-being by offering generous portions of vegetables, fruit, and
whole grains; reducing salt, added sugars, fats, and oils; and by eliminating artificial additives.

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the following priorities are also adopted and implemented as part of
Cook County’s participation in the Good Food Purchasing Program (GFPP).

 Priority Communities- Incentivize investment in low-to-moderate income communities where at least
51% of households have incomes at or below 80% of the area median income (AMI), as defined by the
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Priority will be given to communities that also
have scores ranging between 30.1 and 82.7 on the University of Illinois at Chicago Great Cities
Institute’s Economic Hardship Index
Urban Farm Land Preservation-Preserve publicly-owned vacant land for urban agriculture. Promote
conveyance of publicly-owned vacant land to local minority owned and/or controlled social enterprises;
and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That Cook County Departments and Agencies involved in the
procurement or service contracting of foods will adopt Good Food Purchasing Standards, which include
options and flexibility within each of these five value categories, as a framework for guiding values-driven
purchasing; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That all relevant Cook County Departments and Agencies, with
assistance from the Chicago Food Policy Action Council, Center for Good Food Purchasing, and other
relevant diverse stakeholders, will take the following steps in support of the purchasing of Good Food:
1.

Communicate Good Food Purchasing Standards to appropriate suppliers, including distributors and
foodservice companies, and ask them to share data that will help the County complete a baseline Good
Food Purchasing assessment of food procurement practices within 12 months of the adoption of this
Resolution.

2.

Incentivize businesses to grow food organically and engage in bio-dynamic agriculture, developing
incentives for Requests for Proposal reviews and other potential supports during the contracting
period; and

3.

Incentivize prospective food vendors to invest in and hire from low-to-moderate income Communities
by: 1) developing incentives for Requests for Proposal reviews for prospective vendors that
demonstrate a track record of hiring and investing in such communities; and 2) assisting prospective
vendors in navigating tax incentives and other financial programs designed to increase investment in
disadvantaged communities; and

4.

Incentivize conveyance of publicly-owned vacant land to local minority owned and/or controlled
social enterprises and/or community land trusts in an equitable fashion by setting ownership goals for
minority owned and controlled enterprises; developing incentives for Requests for Proposal reviews;
exploring possibilities for technical assistance and financial assistance, including tax incentives; and

5.

Incentivize hiring people with arrest and conviction records by developing incentives for Requests for
Proposal reviews, exploring options for technical assistance and financial assistance, including tax
incentives; and

6.

Engage local universities, social enterprises and small consulting firms with demonstrated expertise
in providing technical assistance to emerging and/or disadvantaged businesses; and

7.

After the baseline assessment has been completed, develop and adopt an multi-year action plan with
benchmarks to measure success towards Good Food Purchasing Standards and diversity goals,
including accountability systems with appropriate vendors/distributors to verify sourcing
commitments and assess current food procurement practices within 6 months; and

 8.

After the baseline assessment has been completed, establish supply chain accountability and
traceability systems with vendors/distributors to verify sourcing commitments and assess current food
procurement practices within 6 months; and

9.

After the baseline assessment has been completed, incorporate Good Food Purchasing Standards into
new procurement requests and contracts within 6 months; and

10. Seek resources as needed to staff and implement the Good Food Purchasing Standards; and
Report progress to the Cook County Board of Commissioners within 12 months of the adoption of this
Resolution, and then report annually on implementation progress and host an annual public hearing where
diverse community stakeholders and residents can ask questions and provide feedback on implementation,
information should include due diligence reporting data to verify compliance, measure progress, and
celebrate successes.

CALLING FOR COOK COUNTY PUBLIC SAFETY STAKEHOLDERS
TO WORK TOGETHER ON A COURT UTILIZATION STUDY
WHEREAS, based on Clerk of the Circuit Court for Cook County data for 2016 and 2017, there has been
a 47.8% decline in new court cases over the last 10 years across all case types. More specifically, there has
been a 35.4% decline in civil cases, a 56.8% decline in criminal cases, and a 49.5% decline in traffic cases;
and
WHEREAS, this continued decline in case volume suggests that the Circuit Court of Cook County’s 333
courtrooms, originally built to handle the large case volume of the 1970s and 1980s, may currently have
excess capacity; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Circuit Court Branch Court locations are in some of the poorest physical
conditions of any Cook County court houses, needing $25.3 million in repairs over the next 10 years; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Criminal Justice Stakeholders are working continuously and cooperatively
to safely reduce the financial burden of operating the criminal justice system upon Cook County taxpayers;
and
WHEREAS, effective reforms may be instituted only with the support of comprehensive data, accessible
to and acceptable to all of the stakeholders; and
WHEREAS, in light of the need for functional and safe courthouses for the efficient operations of the Cook
County Circuit Court System as well the aging facilities, there is a need to determine what resources will
be needed in the future and what alternatives are available to secure those resources; and
WHEREAS, a courtroom utilization study should be performed so that the use of the Cook County Circuit
Court courtrooms (including Branch Courts and District Court Houses) may be maximized, with court calls
correctly sized and scheduled based on a complete understanding of when, for how long and in what ways,
courtrooms are used; and
WHEREAS, such a study should be obtained from an appropriate vendor, capable of providing a brief but
comprehensive report outlining the best practices and recent trends. The scope of the study should include
but not be limited to:
 A review of the existing documents and reports prepared by the Bureau of Asset Management
including but not limited to space utilization plans and Facilities Building Assessment reports;
 A review of the needs for the judicial system and its’ associated spaces;
 A review of the organizational needs for each of the public safety offices;
 Proposed solutions for reallocation & reorganization; and
 Probable cost(s) for the work proposed.

 WHEREAS, the commissioned study shall also at a minimum include a break downs of the following:





Number of cases heard;
Types of cases heard;
Length (time) of each hearing(s); and
Location of hearing.

WHEREAS, the selected vendor, in coordination with the Bureau of Asset Management, will work with
Department of Budget and Management Services, Sheriff’s Office, and Office of the Chief Judge to
establish a formal process and reporting mechanism to ensure that all stakeholders understand roles and
responsibilities as well as project deliverables, budgets and schedules for the Project Team; and
WHEREAS, in partnership with the Bureau of Asset Management and Department of Budget and
Management Services, all the public safety offices including the Office of the Chief Judge, Sheriff’s Office,
Public Defender’s Office, State’s Attorney’s Office, Clerk of the Circuit Court’s Office and the Justice
Advisory Council shall participate in the planning process and provide any and all necessary data and
evidence needed for the study, excluding any data and evidence limited by law; and
WHEREAS, time is of the essence and to the extent possible the project should be completed as quickly
as possible but no later than May, 2018; and
WHEREAS, the courtroom utilization study will provide valuable guidance for further consideration of
the investment of general revenue in the operation as well as repair and rehabilitation of courtrooms used
by the criminal justice stakeholders and the buildings in which such courtrooms are located.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that the public
safety stakeholders work collaboratively with an external vendor managed by the Bureau of Asset
Management on a Court Utilization Study and that they be prepared to brief the Board on their progress
and final results of the study.
