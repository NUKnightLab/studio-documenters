ORDINANCE

AMENDMENT

TO

REPEAL

THE

SWEETENED

BEVERAGE

WHEREAS, the Sweetened Beverage Tax Ordinance was approved and adopted on November 10,
2016; and
WHEREAS, it has becoming increasingly clear that this is a regressive tax which will cause immediate
and irrevocable hardship to businesses in Cook County and put those businesses in competitive
disadvantage to businesses nearby; and
WHEREAS, the U. S. Census Bureau has reported that from July of 2015 to June of 2016 Cook County
has lost more population than any other county in the entire United States; and
WHEREAS, it has been widely reported that one of the main reasons businesses and residents are
moving out of Cook County is excessive tax regulations; and
WHEREAS, a lawsuit has been filed questioning the constitutionality of this ordinance and Cook County
may again be forced to spend huge sums to defend a potentially unconstitutional ordinance; and
WHEREAS, Crain’s has reported that a recent poll conducted by a credible organization shows that 87
percent of Cook County residents are not in favor of the sweetened beverage tax; and
WHEREAS, although this regressive tax has only been in effect a short time, it appears that many
consumers are crossing county borders to purchase items being taxed and are also buying others items
leading to an ultimate loss of tax dollars to our neighboring counties and states; and
WHEREAS, it is in the best interest of the citizens and businesses of Cook County that this regressive tax
ordinance be repealed;
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioner that Chapter

it is based; whether the rule, amendment to a rule, or repeal of a rule is in proper form; and
whether the notice was given before its adoption, amendment, or repeal and was sufficient to give
adequate notice of the purpose and effect of the rule, amendment, or repeal.

2.

Consider whether the Department has considered alternatives to the rule that are consistent with
the stated objectives of both the applicable statutes and regulations and whether the rule is
designed to minimize economic impact on small businesses.

notify the Department in writing and shall recommend legislative action to remedy the objection.

Summary: The Department of Transportation and Highways respectfully requests authorization to
increase of the agreement with Transystems Corporation for Phase I Preliminary Engineering Services in
the amount of $736,562.09.

In 2005, the Department entered into an agreement with Transystems Corporation for Phase I Preliminary
Engineering Services for Quentin Road, Dundee Road to Lake Cook Road. This project was initiated and
a proposed improvement was presented to the public in 2009; however, this proposal met with significant
opposition due to its impacts to the adjacent Forest Preserve land. Since that time, the Department has
been working with the Forest Preserve and stakeholder groups to identify and address the environmental
concerns such that a new proposed improvement can be developed and implemented.
The project utilizes Federal funding, therefore the Phase I must follow the Federal NEPA process. Since
the contract was initiated, the NEPA processing for the Phase I has been elevated from a Categorical
Exclusion (CE) to an Environmental Class of Action Determination (ECAD) to an Environmental
Assessment (EA).
All levels of processing require similar steps, but the EA requires a much more
in-depth level of analysis than a CE. It is not uncommon for an EA Phase I to take several years to
complete, to produce a proposed improvement which can be approved by the Federal Highway
Administration. At this time we believe we have identified all scope items which will be required to
complete the full EA Phase I process, and Transystems has prepared a supplemental scope and cost
estimate which outlines the additional services required to complete the Phase I. The major tasks included
in the expanded scope are detailed engineering studies for an additional alternative including detailed
drainage and water quality analyses, conduct a third Public Information Meeting to present two finalist
project alternatives, conduct environmental and hydraulic studies and analyses of the Dunhaven Woods
subdivision complex as a potential area to implement stormwater detention and water quality best
management practices (BMPs), plan, prepare, and attend six NEPA/404 Merger meetings, plan, prepare,

Presented by: SUSAN CAMPBELL, Director, Department of Planning and Development
PROPOSED INTERGOVERNMENTAL AGREEMENT
Department: Planning and Development
Other Part(ies): The Town of Cicero
Request: Approve an Intergovernmental Agreement between Cook County and the Town of Cicero
Goods or Services: The Cook County Department of Planning and Development will administer the
Town of Cicero’s Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG) in the amount of $135,154.00 on the Town’s behalf,
providing critical services to homeless individuals and those at risk of becoming homeless in the Town of
Cicero.
Agreement Number(s): N/A
Agreement Period: The agreement is effective as of 1/1/2017 and will remain in effect until the ESG
funds are expended. This is a one-time agreement, but Cook County and the Town of Cicero may execute
similar agreements in the future for additional ESG funds received by the Town Cicero.
Fiscal Impact: None
Accounts: N/A
Summary: The Town of Cicero is receiving ESG funding from the U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development (HUD) for the first time. Cicero has asked the County to administer this new funding
on the Town of Cicero’s behalf. Cook County has been a long-time recipient of its own ESG funding from
HUD and has successfully administered the ESG program throughout suburban Cook County, including in
the west suburban area that includes Cicero. Cook County will utilize a small portion of Cicero’s ESG
funding to cover its administrative costs, but the vast majority of the funding will be provided via subgrant
to Housing Forward, an agency with a strong track record of utilizing ESG funding in the western suburbs.

Summary:

The County Clerk’s Office is requesting approval of a payment in the amount of $11,570.16

to JJ Collins Sons, Inc., the vendor for printing and mailing of voter information.

The invoice reflects an

amount over the original contract value due to the redesign of the household mailers which now display
location and candidates’ name like the sample ballots.

The additional details along with the change in the

size of the mailers increased the printing costs.
