Jan Anderson, Director

Detroit Parks and Recreation Division

18100 Meyer Rd

Detroit, MI

Dear Ms. Anderson,

On behalf of The Greening of Detroit, I am writing to offer our full assistance in purchasing and
installing an EPA grant funded in?ltration basin along the southern portion of Eliza Howell Park
north of Schoolcraft Road. This green infrastructure practice will be capable of managing
stormwater pollution by reducing highway runoff by over 50,000 gallons. It is envisioned that
improvements within Eliza Howell Park will be able to capture. store, and infiltrate mnoff to
remove sediment that would currently discharge to the Rouge River. The grant calls for planting
50 trees, approximately I44 shrubs, and native seed mix throughout the installation. The costs,
rounding $350,000, are being home by the group mentioned above. These improvements will take
place from July 2019 May 2020. Our organization has communicated with community
representative Sidewalk Detroit to ensure these improvements are desired. The Greening of Detroit
has budgeted for 200 hours of scheduled maintenance to maintain this site throughout the summer
including mowing, mulching, and vegetation replacement as needed.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

44%

To Whom It May Concern
Eliza Howell Park,

As of June 18, 2019, Eliza Howell Park had been the new project site location for US EPA Grant ii EPA-RS-
GLZDIG-UWM, awarded to The Greening of Detroit in partnership with The City of Detroit, MDOT and
OHM.

Environmental conditions at the original project site, Forman Park, excluded it from deeper excavation
required for an underground outlet pipe, as needed for green stormwater installations in the city of
Detroit. The general consensus was to eliminate Forman Park, and evaluate alternative sites. 0f the sites
proposed by the City, Eliza Howell Park was chosen based on its closest match to the original intent of
the grant, as well as the potential for a higher level of community engagement for the project.

The original award for the grant was $474,916. With considerable site work leading up to the change of
project site leaves the remaining total value of the project at $374,725.

Re: Urban Watershed Management Implementation 
Eliza Howell F'ark Preliminary Credit Narrative

This memorandum is written as a follow up to the most recent memo OHM has prepared for The Greening of
Detroit and The City of Detroit - General Services Department regarding the implementation of Urban
Watershed Management in Eliza Howell Park. The purpose of this memorandum is to summarize the
estimated credits that the City could expect with the implementation of this green stormwater infrastructure
both for Eliza Howell Park and the 1-96 Service Drive.

DRAINAGE CHARGE CREDIT NARRATIVE

As discussed in the previous memo shared with both the Greening and the City. runoff from both Eliza Howell
Park and the i-Q? Service Drive could be treated by GSI constructed in Eliza Howell Park. Details of that
system can be found in the Preliminary Site Plan and Memo attached. In subsequent dialogue with GS D. it
was requested that further information be provided on speci?c Drainage Charge credit this would provide
for both Eliza Howell Park and the Service Drive. represented by (350 and the DPW. respectively. A table
breaking down Drainage Charge Credits can be found belowTotal Tri Area 15.15 2.72 0.51 soars". 13121 34.11% . 10 500..

Calculations detailing the above statistics can be found in the attached Eliza Howell Drainage Charge
Calculation Work Sheets: Additionally. it should be noted that though the total credit for the GSI is 34.4%. it is
divided based upon the ratio of each entity's impervious area to the total impervious area. The credit Is split
between 650 and DPW at a percentage of 62% and 35%. respectively. it should also be noted that it is
assumed that the DPW does not pay a drainage charge.

Re: Urban Watershed Management implementation 
Urban in?ltration Basin to Reduce NPS Pollution in the Great Lakes Basin
Eliza Howell Park Preliminary Stormwater Narrative

This memorandum is written as a follow up to the most recent dialogue OHM has had with The Greening of
Detroit and The City of Detroit - General Services Department (hereafter referred to as the Greening and the
City. respectively) with regard to the implementation of Urban Watershed Management in Eliza Howell Park.
The purpose of this memorandum is to summarize the preliminary engineering design. preliminary cost
estimate and discuss future environmental and permitting challenges related to the implementation of Urban
Watershed Management in Eliza Howell Park.

STORMWATER MANAGEMENT NARRATIVE

In previous discussions with the Greening and the City. OHM introduced a preliminary basin design that
accepted runoff from the l-96 Service Drive and was situated in the southwest corner of Eliza Howell Park.
This basin would then ultimately outlet to the Rouge River.

Since these previous discussions. further investigation has been performed. including a wetland delineation
and deeper research into existing as-buiit information. As a result. the recommended location of the Urban
infiltration basin has been moved northwest: at the location of the existing asphalt parking lot. in addition, the
total impervious tributary area from the I-96 Service Drive has also been updated. The mainline sewer within
the service drive is combined, and therefore cannot be intercepted and conveyed to the basin. However. by
intercepting the DPW sewer laterals, a portion of service drive runoff can still be captured. Additionally, with
the revised placement of the basin. 3 large portion of the interior road of Eliza Howell Park also becomes
tributary to the basin. Updated basin layout can be found on the attached preliminary site plan; updated basin
statistics can be found in the following table:

Total 
I Area 43 Ac.
Rate - w! Factor 0

Basin

50
Rainfall 0.8 ii't.
'Note that this value contingent upon and in?ltration

 

The resulting preliminary cost for this basin amounts to approximately $175,000. A full item-by-item breakdown
can be found in the attached cost estimate.

Roy McCalister, Jr., Councilman
City of Detroit

November 13, 2019

Concerns regarding the following contracts: Contract 6002431 6002432

On September 3, 2019, Council approved: Contract No. 3035956 - Total Contract Amount: $299,000.00
GSD which has contracted services similar Contract 6002431 which is to purchase or rent 3- Wheel
Street Sweepers which are required for Municipal Street Sweeping - Contract Amount $4,000,000.00.

Can we get an explanation as to why there seems to be a doubling of services relative to these contracts?

The week of August 5, 2019, during recess, Contract #6001799 100% Major Street Funding Total Contract
Amount: $7,350,460.88 was approved for paving and cement work as needed throughout the City of Detroit.
The currently proposed Contract 6002432 appears as though we, as a city are getting into road repair work.
This contract is listed at $1,000,000.00 and is for the purchase of and or rental of street repair and or
resurfacing, pothole and other road work equipment. Again, can we please get clari?cation as why there
appears to be a doubling of same services, but these contracts are both for the purchase or renting of equipment

by the City to do the work ourselves?

Sincerely,

Roy McCalister, Jr.
