The Chairperson thereupon declared said Motion carried and said Resolutions adopted.
Commissioner Martin Nesbitt, Chairperson of the Finance & Audit Committee, then presented
his monthly report. Per Commissioner Nesbitt, the Finance & Audit Committee meeting was
held on Wednesday, January 14, 2004, and the Chief Financial Officer and his staff presented the
Committee with the Treasury and Cash Flow Report as of December 30, 2003. In addition,
Walter Smith, Director of ITS presented the Committee with an overview on the Vendor Prequalified process.
Commissioner Nesbitt then introduced an Omnibus Motion for adoption of the resolutions for
Items A1 through A6, discussed, voted and recommended for Board approval by the Finance and
Audit Committee.
(Item A1)
The CHA currently has fourteen Private Property Mangers (PPMs) and six Resident
Management Companies (RMCs) under contract to manage its portfolio of seventy nine
properties. The Authority previously required each property to have an Office of Management
and Budges A-133 audit; however, the scope of work for the audits was limited and a number of
firms’ audits did not provide the Authority with the assurance it required. Accordingly, a
Request For Proposal (RFP) for Professional Auditing Services was released in October 2003.
The RFP was mailed to 25 accounting firms and advertised in area newspapers. Of the eight
proposals received, oral presentations were held with four companies. Based on the selection of
the evaluation committee, Calibre CPA Group was recommended to conduct audits for the PPMs
and Velma Butler and Company was recommended to conduct audits for the RMCs.
Accordingly, the resolution for Item A1 approves award of contracts to the two named
companies.
RESOLUTION NO. 2004-CHA-3
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the
memorandum dated December 22, 2003, entitled “Contract Award for
Independent Professional Auditing Services for the Private Property
Management Firms and Resident Management Companies” to Calibre CPA
Group for the PPMs and to Velma Butler & Co., Ltd. for the RMCs.
2

 THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

It is recommended that the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief
Executive Officer or his designee to enter into separate contracts with Calibre
CPA Group to provide auditing services for the Private Property Management
firms and with Velma Butler & Co., Ltd. to provide auditing services for the
Resident Management Companies, each for an initial two (2) year period for an
amount-not-to-exceed $353,600 and $430,500, respectively (for a total amount for
such contracts’ initial terms not to exceed $784,100) and each with a one (1) year
option, subject to Board and (if required) U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development (“HUD”) approval.

(Item A2)
The CHA extensively utilizes Microsoft software in its daily operations. CHA’s computers
inter-change information via software operating systems, electronic mail and word processing
programs. As CHA replaces or adds new computer systems, additional Microsoft software and
licenses will be required. The resolution for Item A2 grants authority to enter into a cooperative
purchasing agreement with the City so that CHA can enroll as an affiliate under the City’s
Microsoft Select Agreement. Although the CHA could enter into its own Microsoft Select
Agreement, because of the much smaller volume of software products and licenses required, the
CHA could not achieve the same high discount level that has been obtained by the City.
RESOLUTION NO. 2004-CHA-4
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated January 6,
2004, entitled “Authorization to Enter Into a Cooperative Purchasing Agreement
with the City of Chicago to Utilize and Enroll under its Microsoft Select
Agreement NO. 01S64333 with Microsoft for the Supply and Delivery of
Microsoft Software”.
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners hereby authorize s the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to enter into a cooperative purchasing agreement with the City of
Chicago to utilize and enroll in its Microsoft Select Agreement 01S64333 dated
November 21, 2003, for supply and delivery of Microsoft software”), at a Not to
Exceed price of $750,000 for a contract term of 34 months.

(Item A3)
The CHA has been using professional consultants to supplement internal resources and to
implement the Information Technology Strategic Plan. In the spring of 2002, a Request for
Qualification (RFQ) was conducted and ninety- four firms were pre-qualified for a two year term.
In approving this RFQ, HUD required that additional solicitation be done after the two year term
to allow additional firms the opportunity to pre-qualify. Pursuant to such requirements, the CHA
issued an RFQ soliciting qualified firms who could supplement the existing pool. Two hundred
and twenty two firms, including seventy-nine MBE/WBE firms were solicited. The resolution
for Item A3 approves Master Agreements for 105 firms, not-to-exceed $15 million, for addition
to the ITS consulting Pools.
RESOLUTION NO. 2004-CHA-5
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated December 16,
2003, titled “Authorization to add additional vendors, funds, and to extend the
contract to the six (6) pre-qualified management consulting firm pools for the
following categories: (1) ITS consulting, (2) telecommunications, (3) Lan/Wan,
(4) data base architecture and development, (5) geographic information systems,
and (6) web design and implementation for an additional not-to-exceed amount of
$15,000,000.00.”
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to add additional vendors, to the six (6) pre-qualified consulting firm
pools for the following categories: (1) ITS consulting, (2) telecommunications,
(3) LAN/WAN, (4) database architecture and development, (5) geographic
information systems, and (6) web design and implementation and, enter into the
master agreement with the firms listed herein, to authorize additional not-to3

 exceed amount of $15,000,000.00 for services required by the CHA, requested by
Requests for Service (RFS) to a pre-qualified pool from time to time, and to
extend the contract for the pre-qualified management consulting firm pools for the

(Item A4)
In June 2001, the ITS Department purchased Oracle products to replace the legacy systems and
to be the platform for the CHA Systems@Work. CHA purchased Oracle through an MBE firm,
and maintenance costs and services were negotiated in the agreement and provided for the first
year. Services to support the Oracle products have since expired. In order to support ongoing
relocation activities and information management, the Department of ITS must maintain the
Oracle platform. Accordingly, the resolution for Item A4 approves a one year contract with
Oracle Corporation for support and maintenance services.
4

 RESOLUTION NO. 2004-CHA-6
WHEREAS, The Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the
memorandum dated November, 21, 2003, titled “Authorization to Enter Into a
Contract with Oracle Corporation for Support and Maintenance Services”.
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners hereby authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to enter into a contract with Oracle Corporation for Maintenance and
Support Services for a one year term for a total contract amount of $113,630.

(Item A5)
To support the process of relocation of CHA families, the ITS Department is in the process of
developing mission critical software applications for its business units that will require
maintenance on a long term basis. In order to maintain the integrity of the source code that
comprises software programs and associated fields developed by ITS, and support of a software
development change management process, the software known as ClearCase and ClearQuest is
needed. Accordingly, an Invitation for Bid to competitively solicit qualified firms to deliver
Rational Software was advertised in area newspapers. IBM Corporation was the sole bidder.
Subsequently, it was determined that IBM is the sole provider of Rational Software and does not
distribute it through resellers. Accordingly, the resolution for Item A5 approves award of
contract to IBM Corporation to supply, deliver and maintain Rational ClearCase and ClearQuest
software.
RESOLUTION NO. 2004-CHA-7
WHEREAS, The Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the
memorandum dated January 6, 2004 titled “Authorization to Enter Into a Contract
with IBM Corporation for Supply, Delivery and Maintenance of Rational
ClearCase and Rational ClearQuest Software”;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners hereby authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to enter into a one (1) year contract with IBM Corporation to supply,
delivery and maintain Rational ClearCase and Rational ClearQuest software for a
firm fixed price of $161,460.

(Item A6)
In November 2003, the CHA issued an Invitation for Bid (IFB) to competitively solicit qualified
firms to supply and deliver office supplies, toner cartridges and paper to the CHA. Ninety-seven
vendors were directly solicited, including 47 MBE and 6 WBE vendors. Of the 13 bids received,
three were deemed no n-responsive. Based on the committee’s evaluation, the resolution for Item
A6 approves award of contract to Warehouse Direct for office supplies and Corporate Express
for toner cartridges and paper.
RESOLUTION NO. 2004-CHA-8
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated January 6,
2004, entitled “Authorization to Enter Into a Contract with Warehouse Direct for
Supply and Delivery of Office Supplies, and a Contract with Corporate Express

THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to enter into a two (2) year indefinite quantity contract with Warehouse
Direct for the supply and delivery of office supplies for a not-to-exceed price of
$400,000.00, and a two (2) year indefinite quantity contract with Corporate

finance mixed income developments; entered into agreements with interested parties to provide
housing units for the use of CHA tenants; negotiated and oversaw the acquisition of land for
CHA’s redevelopment plans; and facilitated cooperation among various public entities,
developers and non-profit organizations. Since CHA still requires these services to be performed

building types, including three- flats, six- flats, townhouses and small multi- story apartment
buildings with entrances oriented to the street. No building will exceed five stories. The budget
6
