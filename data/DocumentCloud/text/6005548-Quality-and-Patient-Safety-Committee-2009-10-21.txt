CAMH Standard: EC.02.03.05 (EP6)
JC Finding: During the period of January through December 2008, it was
noted that the hospital did not record the engine running time for the weekly
electric fire pump located in the E Building. A staff person reported that the fire
pump is tested for a total of 5 minutes weekly.
Action: Weekly fire pump testing is conducted by a Public Safety Officer and
witnessed by an Electrician, Plumber and Heating & Operating staff person.
Results and actual running time (Start/Stop Times) of each test is documented
immediately after each test. Weekly testing is verified through sign-off by the
Associate Administrator of Physical Plant Services
Services.
MOS Results: Jun 100%, Jul 100%, Aug 100%, Sep 100%

CAMH Standard: UP.01.03.01 (EP5)
JC Finding: Observed that during the final verification "time out" procedure, the correct
patient identity had not been verified per hospital requirement. The patient's name was
the sole element used. The hospital's policy requires the use of the medical record as
the second identifier. The patient identification wrist band was under the surgical drapes
and was not accessed to corroborate the required information.
Action: Dry erase boards were installed in the operating room to outline components of
each team member's role in the time out process as well as the critical elements
necessary for correct patient identification. The Direct Observation Form (completed by
the Circulating Nurse) has been updated to include verification of whether team

MOS Results: Jun 100%, Jul 100%, Aug 100%, Sep 100%

CAMLAB Standard: QC.1.20 (EP7)
JC Finding: Observed in proficiency testing review that the proficiency testing was not
satisfactory when it scored 0% for HDL Cholesterol on the third event of 2007; 60% for
Chloride on the first event of 2007; 40% for Prothrombin time and Fibrinogen on the
second event of 2008; 20% for Prothrombin time and 0% for Fibrinogen on the third
event of 2008; 0% for Infectious Mononucleosis on the third event of 2008; and 0% for
pH, 0% for pO2, and 0% for pCO2 on the second event of 2007.
Action: An online account was set up with the College of American Pathologists (CAP)
for the E-Lab product. This allows the online entry of survey event results and the review
of results by a second person. The Proficiency Testing Policy (#1105) was modified to
contain
co
a e
expanded
pa ded language
a guage regarding
ega d g the
e requirements
equ e e s o
of p
proficiency
o c e cy testing.
es g The
e
Director of Clinical Laboratory maintains a data sheet on proficiency testing. The Data
sheet lists every scheduled proficiency testing event including the shipping date to CAP,
name and event, date results received by CAP, date report received by hospital, date of
review and signature and data noting event success or failure. The Director of Clinical
Laboratory reviews all results. If there is a failure rate of two consecutive tests or 2 out of
three failures in a similar proficiency set, the results are reported to the Joint
Commission. The Joint Commission requires attaining a score of at least 80% for all
specialties,
p
, subspecialties

MOS Results: May 99%, Jun 100%, Jul 96%, Aug 96%

CAMLAB Standard: QC.7.10 (EP4)
JC Finding: Observed in Hematology, during April 2008, the laboratory did not run one
level of control in the open mode each eight hours of patient testing. During January and
February 2009,
2009 the laboratory did not test one level of control for every eight hours of
patient testing in the open mode. The laboratory tested a normal patient sample and an
abnormal patient sample in the open and closed modes of the Coulter Gen S and LH500
once each day on the first shift. The laboratory did not have a process to perform at
least one patient control each eight hours of patient testing. Noted discrepancies require
that the controls are checked and rerun or new controls are used and the calibration is
checked. If discrepancies continue to occur, service is obtained.
Action: The Hematology Quality Control Policy and Procedure was revised to include
th requirement
the
i
t that
th t att least
l

was tested in duplicate on a hemocytometer but no control was run within eight hours of
testing A tracer patient had a CSF fluid cell count that was tested in duplicate on a
testing.
hemocytometer but no control was run within eight hours of testing. A tracer patient had
a peritoneal fluid cell count that was tested in duplicate on a hemocytometer but no
control was run within eight hours of testing. The laboratory did not have controls
available for manual cell counts performed on the hemocytometer.
Action: The Body Fluid Cell count Policy and Procedure has been revised to include the
use of commercial control material for the quality control of manual cell counts
performed on the hemocytometer. All Medical Technologists and Medical Laboratory

 Definitions & Benchmarking
Adverse Drug Events

Medication Errors

Adverse Drug Reactions
(dark grey area only)

What is an adverse drug event?
An adverse drug event is “an injury resulting from the use of a drug. Under this definition, the term
ADE includes harm caused by the drug (adverse drug reactions and overdoses) and harm from the
use of the drug (including dose reductions and discontinuations of drug therapy).”

Medication errors are more
common than adverse drug
events, but result in harm less
than 1% of the time. About 25%
of adverse drug events are due to
medication errors.
Nebecker et al. Ann Inter Med
2004; 140:795-801

What is an adverse drug reaction (ADR)?
An adverse drug reaction is a “response to a drug which is noxious and unintended and which
occurs at doses normally used in man for prophylaxis, diagnosis, or therapy of disease or for the
modification of physiologic function.” Note that there is a casual link between a drug and an adverse
drug reaction. In summary…an adverse drug reaction is harm directly caused by the drug at
normal doses, during normal use.
What is a medication error?
Medication errors are mishaps that occur during prescribing, transcribing, dispensing,
administering, adherence, or monitoring a drug. Examples: misreading or miswriting a
prescription
