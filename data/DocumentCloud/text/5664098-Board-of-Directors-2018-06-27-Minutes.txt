PROJECTS

Comerica Ballpark: Approval Reimbursement of 2017 Scheduled Repairs and
lmprovements.

Mr. Brown advised that Article 11.1 of the Amended and Restated Concession and Management
Agreement (the CMA), by and between the Detroit Downtown Development Authority (the 
and the Detroit Tigers, inc. (the ?Tigers") assigns to the Tigers responsibility to maintain the Ballpark
as a first-class sports and entertainment complex and in good repair and operating condition. Article
11.5 of the CMA identifies the terms and conditions for making repairs and improvements to the
Ballpark, which include obtaining prior consent to the repairs from the DDA and Stadium Authority.

The CMA establishes under Section 11.6 a Maintenance Repair and Replacement Fund (MRRF)
to assure that a reasonable amount of funds is avaiiable to reimburse the approved repairs and
replacements (improvements). Beginning April 1, 2001, the DDA contributed $250,000.00 and
beginning December 31, 2006, the Tigers contributed a fixed amount of $300,000.00 to the Fund.
Each year thereafter the DDA and Tigers are obiigated under the CMA to deposit into the MRRF a
combined amount of $550,000.00 (the contribution increases each year based on the 
index; for 2018 the amount is $351 ,521 .04)

The Board by its resolution DDA Code 17-12?83-155 approved on December 17, 2017 consented
to a budget for proposed by the Tigers for 2017 season scheduled repairs and improvements to
the Ballpark in the amount not to exceed 610,000.00.

The Tigers have submitted request with supporting documentation for the reimbursement
from the MRRF for eligible repairs and improvements during the 2017 season in the amount of 
602,297.36.

In accordance with Article 11.2 of the CMA and the Tigers' Diverse Business Program, the Tigers
report that 48% of the contracts were defined as discretionary contracts; of which, 54% were
awarded to Wayne County businesses, 33% were awarded to disadvantaged businesses and 20%
were awarded to Detroit based businesses. (Refer to attached Comerica Park 2017 Scheduied
Improvements).

Based on a review of the detailed documentation against the budget and discussion with the Tiger?s
regarding the reallocated budget line item amounts, DDA staff finds the 2017 repairs and
improvements invoice for reimbursement are in compliance with the purposes of the MRRF and
recommends payment of the total requested amount of $602,297.36.

The current MRRF cash balance as of May 31, 2018 before this reimbursement is $1,386,315.70
A resolution was included for the Board?s consideration.

Subsequent to a discussion, the Board took the following action:

On a motion by Mr. Hosey, seconded by Mr. Nagiick, Resolution Code DDA 18-06-83.
157 was unanimously approved.

Mr. Lewand advised that he was switching the order of the agenda and called on Mr. Tomey to
report on Project ltem Iii.

Catalyst Development Project: 2715 Woodward
Mr. Tomey advised that on December 11, 2014, the City of Detroit Downtown Development

Authority (the and Olympia Deveiopment of Michigan, LLC executed that certain
Master Development and Reimbursement Agreement relating to the commitment by ODM to invest,

or cause the investment of, at least $200 Million in private investment as part of the EC Ancillary
Development Project (as amended, the 

Pursuant to the terms of the MDA, ODM must seek approval of proposed development plans in the
event that it seeks to develop one or more "Ancillary Development Properties? properties that
were formerly owned by the City or the Economic Development Corporation and were transferred
to ODM or its affiliates per the MDA) and/or if it seeks to include the investment into the proposed
development project in its $200 Million private investment commitment.

Earlier this month, ODM and the Detroit Medical Center announced the development of a
$65 Million, sports medicine facility and office building immediately north of the
Little Caesars Arena, to feature state of the art sports medicine services and ground floor retail (the
?Project"). The Project will be located on multiple parcels owned by affiliates, including the
parcel at 2715 Woodward, which is an ?Ancillary Development Property?. The developer of the
Project will be an affiliate of ODM, which has secured executed leases with VHS Rehabilitation
institute of Michigan, inc, and its affiliate, VHS Physicians of Michigan, inc.

The $64.5 Million development will be funded through a $35 Million bank loan, with the balance to
be funded through developer equity. At this time, ODM is not requesting that the expected
investment be included in ODM's $200 Million private investment commitment as it plans to seek
other public incentives to support the Project. However, in the event that the Project does not
receive approval for other incentives, has asked to reserve the right to include the Project in
the $200 Million commitment and for a corresponding amendment to related Accepted
Development Agreement. The development proposal, as well as attached site plan, initial
conceptual drawings and elevations, and project budget which were included in the Board material
as Exhibit A (the ?Development Proposal?). The Proposed Project Specific Development
Agreement contemplated by the MDA for any "Accepted Development Agreement" was included
as Exhibit B.

Staff recommended approval of the Development Proposal and related Development Agreement
by the Board. A resolution was included for the Board?s consideration.

Subsequent to the discussion, the Board took the following action:

On a motion by Mr. Crian, seconded by Mr. Blaszkiewicz, Resolution Code DDA 18?06-
123?64 was unanimously approved.

Authority (the and Olympia Development of Michigan, LLC executed that certain
Master Development and Reimbursement Agreement relating to the commitment by to invest, or
cause the investment of, at least $200 Million in private investment as part of the EC Ancillary
Development Project (as amended, the 

Pursuant to the terms of the MDA, ODM is obligated to have received approval of all development
proposals regarding Woodward properties that were formerly publicly owned on or prior to June
29, 2018. To date, ODM has submitted a development proposal with respect to 2743 and 2771
Woodward (Mike llitch School of Business) and 2715 Woodward (DMC Sports Medicine Institute),
but no development proposal has been submitted with respect to 2473 Woodward (the ?Remaining
Woodward Parcel").

Located between 2 parcels owned by an affiliate of ODM in the block between the 1?75 Service
Drive and Henry, the Remaining Woodward Parcel had been largely used for construction laydown
during the construction of the LCA. ODM continues to explore a use that block that complements
and serves an appropriate entrance to the LCA and surrounding development. As such, ODM has

requested, and staff supports, a one-year extension to the deadline for submitting a development
proposal with respect to the Remaining Woodward Parcel only to June 28, 2019.

A resolution was included for the Board's consideration.
Subsequent to a discussion, the Board took the following action:

On a motion by Mr. Hosey, seconded by Mr. Naglick, Resolution Code DDA 18-06-123?
63 was unanimously approved.

Post Arena Opening Survey Report

Ms. Jane Morgan of JFM Consulting Group provided a follow?up report (the full report was included
in the Board materiai) subsequent to Little Caesar?s Arena opening and responded to Board
members questions. This report was for the Board's information only and no action was taken.

Mr. Ogden requested that the final report be redistributed to the Board.
Status Report on the Tieers Ticket Donation Proqram-2018 Mid-Season Activity Report

Ms. Jensen reported that the Detroit Tigers Mid?Season Activity Report was included in the Board
materiai for your review. This report has been reformatted to highlight the following:

. Ticket distribution by geography instead of by highest number of tickets requested.
Letter sent by Tigers to Detroit churches dated May 15, 2018.
. Master List of Churches in Detroit as of May 22, 2018 created by Tigers.

To date, Detroit Tigers have distributed/committed 33,900 tickets to schools and organizations so
that children can attend Major League baseball games. Of which, approximateiy 35% have been
donated to Detroit-based organizations. and approximately 56% have been donated to Wayne
County schools and organizations. Also, an estimated 52% of the organizations that have
requested tickets thus far this season represent organizations in the city of Detroit and Wayne
County.

The mid?season activity report demonstrates an increase in the number and type of organizations
and schools that would be representative of deserving Tiger fans who could not otherwise afford to
see the Tigers play at Comerica Park.

The next Tiger Tickets Donation Committee meeting will be scheduled in October/November 2018
to review the ?nal ticket distribution information and will recommend program changes at the time,
if necessary.

This report was for the Board?s information only; no action was taken.

COMENT

Mr. Lewand called for public comment and advised that they would be given two minutes.

Mr. John Lauve of Holly, Michigan stated the following:
"The kids? plan in the tease has to be approved by DDA and the Stadium
Authority. There is no plan. How many of these tickets are going to kids versus adults-m
not even mentioned. Last year they were short 11,000 tickets. What happened to those?
Well, just forget about it. We didn?t meet our obligation and we don?t have to. But you

better obey the payments to them to repair the Stadium. We?ve got to come up with
everything but they don't have to produce. That is unacceptable to have that kind of

procedure. it is very distressing to me to see you peeple not step up to the plate. Okay,
she made a caii. So what. That is unacceptabie. i guess that is just the way you guys do
business. This catalyst project is supposed to be wonderfui for everything. What do they
build? A pizza headquarters and parking structures. They say, well there is a goodie store
somewhere in there. Then they bring in a couple schools to fill in the rest of the land so
that there is not going to be anybody competing or anything else. They are just a school.
And even the Chairman is not here today. He is not on the minutes as being present or
absent. You have a non-Board member conducting the meetings. That is not what the
State iaw says, but forget about it. You don?t have to follow the rules. We dealt with the
judges here and this deai where i collected the 8,000 signatures to have a vote on this plan
for the ilitches, the whole deal, it wasn?t a plan, it was after it was all done. And the Judge,
Goldsmith, was one of Duggan's dad?s old judges. And he refused to enforce the charter.?

Mr. Lewand advised Mr. Lauve that his two minutes were up and thanked him for his comments.
OTHER MATTERS

Mr. Nagiick made a motion, which was seconded by Mr. Ogden, to adjourn the Regular meeting to
an Executive Session to discuss a litigated matter. A roll call vote was taken and alt eight members
present, or two-thirds of the members, voted in favor of adjourning to an Executive Session.
