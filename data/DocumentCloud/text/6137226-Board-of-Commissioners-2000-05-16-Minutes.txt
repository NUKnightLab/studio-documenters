 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 16, 2000
Reason:

In 1995, the Ch ief Judge commissioned a study, The Clinical Evaluation and Services
Initiative (CESI), to evaluate the delivery of clinical information developed for judges hearing
juvenile delinquency and abuse and neglect cases. CESI is a collaboration of the Department
of Psychiatry at the University of Chicago, the Children and Family Justice Center of the
Northwestern University School of Law, and the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur
Foundation. The primary finding of the CESI report is that the unique and complex nature of
juvenile cases requires that juvenile court have its own clinic. The report recommended that
the clinic be comprised of four separate but integrated units as follows: the Cl inical
Coordination Unit, the Education and Intervention Resource Unit, the Administrative Un it and
the Program Evaluation Unit. Under this proposed contract, Northwestern will design and
imple ment two of the four units, the Education and Intervention Resource Unit and the
Program Evaluation Unit. Northwestern also will implement and evaluate a pilot of the
Clinical Coordination Unit prior to the opening of the clinic. Based upon its work as part of
the CES I collaborative, Northwestern is uniquely qualified to perform these services.
