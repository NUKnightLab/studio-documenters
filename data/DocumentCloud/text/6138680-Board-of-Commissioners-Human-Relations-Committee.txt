 WHEREAS, According to the most reliable public information available at present, 139 homicides have
occurred in the City of Chicago since January of 2015; and,
WHEREAS, The City of Chicago is the county seat and exists entirely within the boundaries of the County of
Cook; and,
WHEREAS, Through its administration of the Health and Hospitals System, the Juvenile Temporary Detention
Center, the Cook County Jail, and the Cook County Circuit Court, Cook County is heavily impacted by the costs
of and associated with gun violence; and
WHEREAS, A study by the University of Chicago Crime Lab puts the financial toll of gun violence at
approximately $2.5 billion annually, factoring in lost productivity, medical and psychiatric care, and the
antisocial behavior that can often result from untreated trauma; and,
WHEREAS, It is both in the interests of the taxpayers and the responsibility of the fiscal stewards of the Cook
County that the issue and the costs associated with gun violence be examined in depth by the committee of the
Board tasked with reviewing matters of human rights throughout the County;
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the President of Cook County and the Cook County Board of
Commissioners that the issue of gun violence be referred to a meeting of the Human Relations Committee of the
