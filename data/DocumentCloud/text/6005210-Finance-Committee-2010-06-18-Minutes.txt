III. Action Items
A. Minutes of the Finance Committee Meeting, May 14, 2010
Director Muñoz, seconded by Director O’Donnell, moved to accept the minutes of the Finance Committee
Meeting of May 14, 2010. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

B. Continued discussion and action on items from May 27, 2010 Board of Directors Meeting regarding
revenue cycle contractual arrangements (Attachment #1)
Michael Ayres, System Chief Financial Officer, provided an overview of the items presented for the
Committee’s consideration. He noted that additional information has been presented for these items, including
information prepared in response to questions from Director Ansell. (Attachment #2).
At the May 27th Board Meeting, a request to enter into and execute a contract with PricewaterhouseCoopers
(PwC), for performance improvement implementation services, was presented for the Board’s consideration.
There were five components, or Statements of Work, within the contract; the five components under the
proposed contract were related to revenue cycle; labor and productivity; supply chain; physician funding plan;
and the Ambulatory and Community Health Network of Cook County (ACHN) operations. The Board
approved the contract on May 27th, but deferred action by the administration from entering into a Statement of
Work for revenue cycle, until further action by the Board.
Also presented on May 27th was a request to terminate Contract Number 08-41-245 with MedAssets. This
request was deferred, and remanded back to the Finance Committee.
Mr. Ayres stated that they continue to refine the contract with PwC, to develop the non-revenue cycle
Statements of Work; this is close to completion, and they are within days of being ready to sign the Master
Services Agreement.
Director O’Donnell inquired regarding transition of revenue cycle activities from one vendor to another, and
how this might delay or disrupt current activities. Mr. Ayres stated that he did not feel that much time would
be lost; there may be a week in which realignment will be needed, and some steps may need to be revisited.
Director O’Donnell clarified that the request for PwC before the Committee relates specifically to the revenue
cycle Statement of Work. Mr. Ayres responded affirmatively; however, he noted that the information and
materials provided, particularly with regard to Director Ansell’s questions, relate to the overall PwC contract.
The Committee discussed the subject of the management of a contingency contract for revenue cycle activities.
Chairman Carvalho stated that MedAssets’ contract originally began as a contingency-based contract. It was
concluded that the System found it difficult to manage this type of contract, so the contract moved to a fixed
fee contract. William T. Foley, Chief Executive Officer of the Cook County Health and Hospitals System,
provided additional information on the subject. He stated that when the MedAssets contract moved to a fixed
fee contract, it was felt at that time that the System did not have the ability to manage a contingency-based
contract. At this time, however, Mr. Foley indicated that the System is now equipped to manage a
contingency-based contract. He added that the System Director of Performance Improvement, Jeanene
Johnson, will be working closely with Mr. Ayres.

III. Action Items
B. Continued discussion and action-revenue cycle contractual arrangements (continued)
Chairman Carvalho stated that what is before the Committee is the proposed action relating to the Statement of
Work for revenue cycle for the contract with PwC; also before the Committee is the request to terminate the
contract with MedAssets for revenue cycle services. Chairman Carvalho stated that the displacement of
MedAssets was proposed to be done under the clause relating to cancellation of contract for convenience. This
proposed action has nothing to do with an evaluation of performance; rather, it was a recommendation from the
administration to wrap all of this in one contract with one vendor, in order to have it all work seamlessly.
Chairman Carvalho stated that he has been informed that there is an aspect of this matter that will need to be
discussed in closed session.
At this time, the Committee recessed the regular session and convened in closed session. See page 7 for the
motions made following the adjournment of closed session, and relating to the two contractual requests for
Item III(B).

C. **Contracts and Procurement Items (Attachment #3)
Note: This item was taken out of order.
Ann Marie Huddleston, Interim Deputy Director of Supply Chain, presented the requests for the Committee’s
consideration.
A presentation was made with regard to the request to enter into and execute a contract with NuCare Services
Corporation, for short-term and long-term care services (Attachment #4). The following individuals presented
information on the request: John Morales, Chief Financial Officer of John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook
County; Sharon Freyer, Chief Nursing Officer, Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County; Dr. Gina Gaston,
Assistant Director of Case Management; and Laura Walfeldt, Director of Case Management at John H.
Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County. Questions were raised and addressed with regard to facility licensure
and certification with the State, patient satisfaction and patient involvement in selection of location.
Director Muñoz requested that the Committee receive information relating to the certification from the State
that these facilities are meeting regulations with respect to long-term care. Following this request, it was stated
that IDPH monitors these facilities. Ms. Walfeldt provided additional information relating to this subject.
During the presentation, Chairman Carvalho asked how the proposed rate compares with the short-term
Medicare rate. Ms. Freyer responded that the 2010 Prospective Payment System (PPS) rates for Medicare can
range from around $200 to $630. Chairman Carvalho asked if there is a reason for having only one rate for
short-term care, rather than a rate based upon Resource Utilization Group System (RUGS) scores that are
established by Medicare. Ms. Walfeldt responded that the reason for this is administrative-related. Chairman
Carvalho inquired why short-term Categories I and II were created, rather than using the RUGS scores.
Gretchen Ryan, of MedAssets, provided additional information. She noted that her comments were in the
context of discussion of non-Medicare patients. She stated that with Medicare patients, there are a series of
steps that are required in order to receive payment from Medicare. From an administrative standpoint, if the
patient does not qualify for Medicare, there is a significantly lesser amount of paperwork that is required, in
comparison to the documentation required by Medicare.

III. Action Items
C. **Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)
Chairman Carvalho requested a list of the facilities to be provided to him1, and inquired whether the Medicare
Star Rating System was used in the assessment of the facilities. Ms. Freyer responded that all of the facilities
were rated between two and three stars.
The Committee returned to the other requests presented for consideration. The following individuals provided
additional information on the requests presented for consideration: Mr. Ayres; Daniel Howard, System Chief
Information Officer; Dr. Judith Frigo, Chief Medical Officer for Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County; and
Johnny Brown, Chief Operating Officer for John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County.
During the discussion of request number 8, a request to increase the contract with IDPH for State-mandated
metabolic tests on newborns born at Stroger Hospital, Director O’Donnell inquired whether the increase
includes for the provision of testing for newborns that are not born at Stroger Hospital. Roz Lennon, System
Chief Clinical Officer, responded affirmatively. Chairman Carvalho noted that this heel stick test is usually
done at birth; he wondered why this test is not being done at the birthing hospitals, in some cases. He stated
that, although he is abstaining on the matter before the Committee because it is a contract with IDPH, he will
look into the subject at the State.
During the discussion of request number 12, Chairman Carvalho requested that an overview and outline be
provided on all of the vendors who are involved in the billing cycle.
Director Ramirez, seconded by Director O’Donnell, moved the approval of request numbers 1 through 28, as
amended, under the Contracts and Procurement Items, with the exception of request number 16, which will be
discussed in closed session, and conditional approval of request numbers 17, 18 and 22, pending contract
compliance. THE MOTION CARRIED.
Chairman Carvalho abstained and voted PRESENT on request numbers 1 and 8.
*Note: following the adjournment of closed session, request number 16 was recommended for approval (see
page 6).

D. Proposed Academic Affiliation Agreements (Attachment #5)
(Agreements with fiscal impact) These agreements were reviewed by the Quality and Patient Safety
Committee on May 18, 2010.
Note: this item was considered concurrently with Item III(F).
Dr. John O’Brien, Chairman of the Department of Planning, Education, and Research of John H. Stroger, Jr.
Hospital of Cook County, provided an overview of the agreements presented for consideration. He noted that
these have been reviewed and recommended to move forward by Director Lyne’s ad hoc work group on
affiliations. Additionally, he stated that one of the components of PwC’s activities will be to evaluate these
relationships.
Director O’Donnell, seconded by Director Ramirez, moved to approve request numbers 1 through 23, under the
proposed Academic Affiliation Agreements and Supplemental Proposed Academic Affiliation Agreements.
THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

Chairman Carvalho requested that Ms. Huddleston check into the status of implementing a system to track exparte communications3. He referenced the section of the CCHHS Procurement Policy that states that for all
Purchases, the Procurement Director shall establish procedures to ensure that communications from individuals
outside the System regarding a Purchase shall be memorialized and maintained in the procurement file. It also
states that communications about a Purchase from or on behalf of a System Director or elected official shall
also be memorialized and maintained in the procurement file.
Chairman Carvalho requested that Ms. Huddleston work with Mr. Guerrero on a communications plan for
vendors, in order to effectively communicate the System’s Purchasing process, and to try to get more vendors
involved in potential bids or RFPs4. Additionally, he inquired whether a search function will be built into the
website, so that information on specific contracts or products can be easily available5. Ms. Huddleston
responded that she will find out.
Included in the information provided was an update on the warehouse consolidation. Mr. Morales provided
additional information on the subject.

VI. Closed Session Discussion/Information Items

and Discussion of Litigation Matter
Director Muñoz, seconded by Director O’Donnell, moved to recess the regular session and reconvene into
closed session, pursuant to the following exceptions to the Illinois Open Meetings Act: 5 ILCS 120/2(c)(1),
which permits closed meetings for consideration of “the appointment, employment, compensation, discipline,
performance, or dismissal of specific employees of the public body or legal counsel for the public body,
including hearing testimony on a complaint lodged against an employee of the public body or against legal
counsel for the public body to determine its validity,” and 5 ILCS 120/2(c)(11), regarding “litigation, when an
action against, affecting or on behalf of the particular body has been filed and is pending before a court or
administrative tribunal, or when the public body finds that an action is probable or imminent, in which case the
basis for the finding shall be recorded and entered into the minutes of the closed meeting.”
On the motion to recess the regular session and convene into closed session, a roll call was taken, the votes of
yeas and nays being as follows:

VI.

Closed Session Discussion/Information Items (continued)
Chairman Carvalho stated that, with regard to the contractual requests for Item III(B), the Committee has
discussed the open and closed session aspects of this. He provided the summary that follows. For the reasons
that were presented at the last several Board and Committee meetings, the administration has recommended,
after a request for proposals (RFP) process, to develop a performance improvement package that includes a
variety of Statements of Work. The Board has heretofore approved most of the Statements of Work; the
Statement of Work that remains to be considered is the revenue cycle services. The recommendation of the
administration was that this entire performance improvement package would be most beneficially structured
for the System if it were all included in one contract, with one vendor. As he mentioned prior to the convening
of closed session, Chairman Carvalho stated that a necessary consequence of that is the termination for
convenience of a vendor who is performing similar or the same work for the System; not a termination for any
other reason other than for the convenience of the System. This is to allow the System to incorporate all of the
Statements of Work in one contract with the vendor who responded to the RFP with a proposal that the
administration evaluated as being most beneficial for the System. This has been discussed in multiple
meetings; he stated that the Committee is in a position to make the necessary motions for the two contractual
requests.
Note: the following two motions containing recommendations for revenue cycle contractual
arrangements were separated from the Minutes of the Finance Committee Meeting, and were
considered and acted upon separately by the System Board on June 25, 2010. Please see the
Minutes of the Meeting of the CCHHS Board of Directors of June 25, 2010 for final disposition.
Director O’Donnell, seconded by Director Muñoz, moved to authorize the issuance of a notice of termination
for convenience of the MedAssets contract. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

*Director O’Donnell, seconded by Director Muñoz, moved to authorize the Chief Executive Officer to move
forward and enter into a Statement of Work for Revenue Cycle Services under the contract this Board has
authorized previously with PricewaterhouseCoopers. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
________________
Director O’Donnell, seconded by Director Ramirez, moved the approval of request number 16, under the
Contracts and Procurement Items. THE MOTION CARRIED.
Chairman Carvalho voted PRESENT.
________________
VII. Adjourn
Miscellaneous – Presentation of Five-year Financial Forecast for Strategic Plan
Chairman Carvalho noted that the Committee received information relating to the Five-year Financial Forecast for
the Strategic Plan; however, there was not enough time at the meeting left for discussion. Therefore, it is presented
for the Committee’s information, and is expected to be presented, along with the Strategic Plan, at the June 25th
Board Meeting for approval.
________________
As the agenda was exhausted, Chairman Carvalho declared the MEETING ADJOURNED.

Re:

Request to Terminate Contract #08-41-245, MedAssets

/'

/,,'

Dear Chairman Batts and Chairman Carvalho:
A three year contract between the Health System and MedAssets was approved by the Cook County Board of
Commissioners on May 20,2008. The contract requires MedAssets to provide Revenue Cycle Re-Engineering and
Operational Improvement Consulting Services and Accounts Receivable Improvement Services.
After a review of our progress in the revenue cycle area, coupled with the identification of numerous other areas in which
the performance of the Health System requires focuse'd and integrated effort, the Health System issued a Request for
Proposals for Performance Improvement Implementation Services. In the RFP, the Health System sought to identify
prospective vendors to provide implementation services with regard to a full range of performance improvement
initiatives, and reserved the right to include revenue cycle services as part of any contract that was pursued. After careful
consideration, we believe that optimal improvements will be achieved through use of a single vendor for both performance
improvement and revenue cycle efforts. Our goal in doing so is to improve the quality of services, reduce duplication of
activities and standardize practices throughout the Health System.
On May 14,2010, we presented a recommendation to the Finance Committee that the Health System enter into a contract
with PricewaterhouseCoopers for performance improvement implementation services, including revenue cycle services.
In order to move forward with this contract, it will be necessary to transition away from our current revenue cycle vendor,
MedAssets. The contract with MedAssets may be terminated upon six months advance written notice to MedAssets.
Authorization is requested to issue a notice terminating the MedAssets contract. I am further requesting authorization to
negotiate and approve an agreement with MedAssets regarding the amounts payable for the services to be provided during
the period prior to the termination date.
Thank you for your consideration.
Sin erely,

JUSTIFICATION: The Health System has committed itself to a significant transformation designed to reduce overall
operating expenses, increase revenues, realign service delivery and implement strategic initiatives designed to improve
overall quality and access to care and reduce the system's dependence on funding from Cook County. CCHHS has
engaged consultants to identify and quantify areas of improvement throughout the System. This work has been the basis
for the development of an all-encompassing multiyear RFP designed to aid management in the implementation of process
improvements throughout the System. The project design impacts virtually all areas of operation and will significantly
alter where and how work is performed. CCHHS does not have and cannot employ the number of technical experts
required to implement these changes. This contract will bring the requisite skills to focus on each area of improvement
and will include staff training, allocation, enhancement o r replacement as necessary to maintain change. This contract
will include revenue cycle services.
TERMS O F REQUEST: This is a full risk all-inclusive contract. Compensation to the vendor is dependent upon
identified and realized cash improvement -- fees collected o r expense avoided. The anticipated benefited is $313.8
million; fees will be paid on an hourly basis after the first $10 million of realized benefit at a ratio of 6:l for the first $200
million of realized benefit and a t a ratio of 7:l if the amount of realized benefit exceeds $200 million; maximum fees are
set at as50 million; no fee will be paid for the first $10 million of realized benefit. Contract consists of a Master Services
Agreement that will be supplemented with individual Statements of Work identifying and controlling specific project
activity.

RE:

Answers to Questions Regarding Contract for Performance Improvement with
PricewaterhouseCoopers

We understand your concerns about the magnitude of the proposed performance improvement opportunity,
the contingency risk, and the communication requirements and have responded to your concerns in the
following section.

1. What are the various work plans and how much revenue (expense reduction) will be generated from
each activity?
ANS. See Benefit Realization Schedule attached.

Page 13 of 192

 Answers to Questions Concerning Contract for Performance Improvement with
PricewaterhouseCoopers
June 15, 2010

a. For example- How do the revenue cycle projections of PwC compare to those from other bidders
and MedAssets?
ANS: CCHHS received responses to the Performance Improvement (“PI”) Request For
Proposal (“RFP”) from the Navigant Consulting Group (“NCI”), PricewaterhouseCoopers
(“PwC”) and Quorum Health Resources (“QHR”). MedAssets did not propose on the project
because they were unable to provide the all services described in the
RFP.
The calculations made by PwC are based their review of the systems business processes,
experience in working with comparable organizations and a number of assumptions on what
process changes can be achieved. These calculations were not specific given the condition of our
data and the time that each consulting group had to evaluate Cook County Health and Hospitals
System’s (“CCHHS’s”) processes. What is clear is that CCHHS is significantly behind in the
implementation of efficient operational processes. CCHHS does not capture all the revenues that
are reimbursable under existing programs and has entered into contracts where alternative
arrangements would be either less expensive or more beneficial. To a large extent, PwC’s
estimate of benefit is a sophisticated guess given the antiquated nature of CCHHS’s structure.
Navigant Consulting Group
NCI did not identify any benefit target for revenue cycle; rather, they added an assessment phase
to identify a revenue cycle benefit target.
PricewaterhouseCoopers
PwC proposed a revenue cycle benefit of $150 million to be achieved over two years.
Quorum Health Resources
QHR did not include any specific benefit targets for revenue cycle.
MedAssets
MedAssets targeted a revenue cycle cash target between $72 and $80 million over a three-year
period beginning June, 2008. As of May 31, 2009, MedAssets has achieved $76 million in cash.

b. What was the data that PWC used to determine the estimates?
ANS. PwC used the information in the NCI assessment in addition to CCHHS’ financial data
provided in the standard data set during the RFP solicitation to establish the preliminary
estimates.

PricewaterhouseCoopers
June 15, 2010

2. Who has PwC presented their work plans to beyond senior management?
ANS: Senior management, key physician leaders and middle managers across the system were involved
in the evaluation and selection of PwC.


The PI RFP Review and Evaluation Committee1 comprised of middle management and staff,
met on March 10, 2010 to review and compare proposals and develop a recommendation for the
PI RFP Executive Evaluation Committee.



The PI RFP Executive Selection Committee2 comprised of select System Leadership, received
oral presentations by all proposers on March 17, 2010 resulting in the recommendation of PwC
to the Board of Directors “Board”.



The PI Physician Leadership Steering Committee3 provided input and direction into the
design of the seven (7) Physician Funding and Effort Statements of Work as well as the Centers
of Excellence Statement of Work (work plans).



Statement of Work Sponsors4 provided direction and input into the development of PwC
Statements of Work. Each of these Sponsors involved their key managers and physicians in the
development of their assigned Statements of Work.

a. Will the full board get to review their presentation and have the opportunity to ask questions?
ANS: Management has applied an extensive evaluation process in the selection of a
comprehensive vendor to partner with CCHHS in its efforts with performance improvement.
Management assumes responsibility to answer any questions that the Board may have regarding
the recommendations made to the Board. All materials related to the selection of PwC and
management’s documentation is available to members of the Board at any time.

 Answers to Questions Concerning Contract for Performance Improvement with
PricewaterhouseCoopers
June 15, 2010

b. Has the senior medical (CMOs, Department Chairs) and administrative leadership had a
presentation.
ANS: Yes. See the answer to question #2.
c. Union leadership?
ANS: System Leadership has held multiple meetings with the bargaining units to brief them
about the upcoming project. System Leadership will continue to involve the bargaining units in
communication about the project as it unfolds.
3. How will the $300 million opportunity be broken down by year?
ANS: See the Benefit Realization Schedule attachment.

4. How much is revenue enhancements and how much expense reductions?
ANS: Revenue enhancements planned by PwC represent 70% of the total targeted benefit.

% of total project

70%

30%

5. It seems like a huge turn around to accomplish in 2 years (1/3 of total budget.) (University of Chicago
did a $ 100 million in 1 year. Simon did about the same in 1 year?)
ANS: Dr. Simon’s effort in 2007 focused primarily on labor expense reductions; whereas, PwC will
take a comprehensive integrated approach across the system looking at revenue enhancement, patient
access, service growth and efficiency. In essence, the project proposed by PwC is designed to help
transform the system. The scale of the envisioned transformation will require a greater amount of time
over a simple expense reduction project. A key element in accomplishing this goal is system-wide
organizational commitment. CCHHS’s transformation will require significant change to the philosophy,

 Answers to Questions Concerning Contract for Performance Improvement with
PricewaterhouseCoopers
June 15, 2010

culture and operational structure throughout the system. We will need to change how we view the
delivery of care and the resources required. Employees -- caregivers and the support staff -- must
embrace these changes. CCHHS must hold Senior Management responsible for making the changes and
management must hold employees equally responsible.
6. I understand the lack of a middle management is driving the need for this- how and when will the
handoffs occur (re: professional billing, revenue cycle, etc) to our staff, if ever?
ANS: Each Statement of Work has planned conversion dates where the operational improvements
related to the transformation will be formally transitioned to the appropriate owner in the health system.
Knowledge transfer is a key component of PwC’s transformation strategy with training and education
deliverables built into the Statements of Work. For revenue cycle there are very few middle managers.
Most of the leadership functions in revenue cycle are currently assumed by MedAssets. These
management functions will be transitioned to PwC upon Board approval of PwC’s contract.
7. How will the contingency fee be managed?
ANS: CCHHS and PwC will jointly agree upon the baseline measurement for each Statement of Work.
PwC will receive credit for benefit delivered above the baseline for the associated tasks. PwC and
CCHHS will review the calculations monthly.

8. This was stated to be a problem with MedAssets and we switched back away from this. How do we
account for improvements already in place with regard to credit?
ANS: The jointly developed baseline will account for PwC’s accomplishments and associated benefit
versus benefit delivered by efforts currently underway in CCHHS. There a very prescriptive process
directed by CCHHS Finance used to evaluate each Statement of Work benefit. The Office of
Performance Improvement will work with each Statement of Work Sponsor (CCHHS System Leader) to
define “who gets credit” prior to the start of any initiative. CCHHS’s improvements already in place
will be identified on each Statement of Work as “out-of-scope”.

9. What is the communication plan?
ANS: CCHHS and PwC are finalizing a Communication Plan currently. The ultimate goal is to ensure
transparency and establish a clear protocol for the dissemination of information to stakeholders both
internally and externally. The draft Communication Plans is attached.

10. What are the true costs of severing the relationship with MedAssets?
ANS: There are two distinctive exposures determining the contract outcome -- finalizing the MedAssets
relationship and converting to PwC revenue cycle interim management. The contract between the
parties stipulates that CCHHS can terminate for convenience with 180 day notice. The fee to be paid
during this period (based on a schedule in the contract amendment) with the effective date of July 1,
2010 is $3,181,000. As of Friday, June 11, 2010 at 1:15 PM we had not reached an agreement with
MedAssets on what role they would play and the compensation to be paid.
Dependent upon timing PwC will assume responsibility for each of the MedAssets initiatives
immediately upon MedAssets being relieved of responsibility for that initiative. The potential exposure
in that transition lies with the loss of progress being made in the individual initiatives. Each vendor has
a different priority and work style that will inevitably cause some disruption in the improvement
process. Any costs will be associated with a delay in implementation as a result of the change rather
than a reduction of benefit or an increase in expense. It is difficult to anticipate how long or if at all a
disruption will occur. Neither CCHHS nor PwC expects any interruption to have a noticeable economic
impact. PwC's commitment calls for an acceleration of benefit significantly beyond the process
currently being achieved through MedAssets.

11. What are the specific accountabilities of PwC to the Finance Committee of the Board?
ANS: Mike Ayres, CFO, is the project owner for PwC’s engagement supported by the CCHHS Office of
Performance Improvement. He reports weekly to William Foley, CEO and the System Leadership team
on the progress, successes and issues related to the contract. In addition, the assigned System
Leadership team will assume responsibility for implementing specific initiatives. Under Mr. Foley's
direction, the Finance Committee and subsequently the Board will be advised monthly as a part of Mr.
Ayres report on the project’s progress.

12. How do we measure success?
ANS: There will be tangible and intangible measures of success. The tangible benefit is measured as
cash improvement over baseline. This tangible benefit is the primary reason we have entered into the
relationship with CCHHS. Other indicators of success include but are not limited to: accelerated
realized cash benefit, improved patient through-put, improved census management, improved wait
times, patient quality metrics, and heightened employee quality and quantity of work, etc. Key
performance indicators will be identified at the start of the engagement and included in each Statement
of Work.
Intangible measures will include improved employee training and morale, the solidification of a
performance improvement culture, improved community image for managing taxpayer resources
efficiently and a renewed focus on patient quality.

13. What are the benchmarks?
ANS: PwC and CCHHS will utilize proprietary internal and well-known external national benchmarks
and best practices. Benchmarks will be tailored to the unique operating environment at CCHHS by using
comparable safety-net and academic health systems. Each Statement of Work will involve using
benchmarks and best practices specific to their areas of focus.

 CCHHS Project Status

Warehouse Consolidation Highlights
Warehouse Consolidation. Team Members include John R. Morales, CFO-JHSH, Paul Wolff, Interim Director-CCHHS Materials
Management, Dan Ruiz, Director-JHSH Materials Management, Warehouse Staff

Initiatives

•
•
•
•

Business Case &
Benefits

• Reduce operating expenses for warehouse storage as a component of JIT planning going forward
• Generate savings from warehouse operations by moving away from maintaining E&O Inventory and non-essential items to only
value added inventory and related items
• Seize the opportunity to convert commodity scrap into cash
• Availability and use of Cook County Warehouse (Hawthorne) in 2011 onward; no chargeback or budgetary allocation has been
proposed resulting in projected reduced operating expenses for the CCHHS

Solutions

Team

Reduce rental expense for warehouse operations
Consolidate inventory/other to items needed for operations only
Convert obsolete or marketable commodities into cash
Be in make-ready condition to relocate to the Hawthorne Facility upon notice from Capital Planning

Proposed one-time revenue $14,915 from the sale of paper stock ($3,200) and Used/Unused X-Ray film ($11,715)
Revenue from the sale of Steel Racking TBD; revenue from misc. scrap sales TBD
Cost savings
Lease savings $29,906 from Provident Lease @ 5 months in 2010 [$71,775 full year impact 2011]; lease savings also include property taxes of
$1,711 for 2010 (Provident); utilities total projected savings for 5 months = $6,416
Total lease savings for 2011 will be $290,312 [JHSH (11 mo.) $218,537 + Provident $71,775]; property taxes saved will include approximately
$16,000 [JHSH] and approximately $3,500 [Provident] for 2011
For 2011, combined utilities savings will total approximately $75,000 (note utilities expense savings assumptions were based on 2009 Actual
Utilities Expense)
Labor/overtime $0.00 for base labor at this time; not included in initial project scope; overtime must be approved beforehand by the JHSH CFO
or the JHSH COO; goal for OT is $0.00 except for specific coverage as presented by management for approval

Implementation
Next Steps

• Notice of Lease Termination served to Landlord in May 2010; vacate Provident warehouse by July 31, 2010
• Complete the sale of paper stock and X-Ray film; pursue sale of steel racking and other scrap materials
• Consolidate the warehouse inventories and prepare for move to the Hawthorne warehouse in January 2011

Timeline

All key steps to vacate the Provident warehouse are projected to be completed by late June or early July

Potential Barriers to
Implementation

No barriers to successful on-time completion of this project have been noted at this time
