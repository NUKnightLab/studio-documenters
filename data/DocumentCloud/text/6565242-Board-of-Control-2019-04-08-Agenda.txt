Robert Math, Cuyahoga Job and Family Services on behalf of the Department of Health and Human
Services/Division of Children and Family Services, presented. Joseph Nanni asked for clarification that
there will be an in-house attorney from the Law Department dedicated to providing legal representation
for families once this contract has ended and asked if there are there any potential conflicts with the
agency while representing the child. Maggie Keenan clarified that the representation will only apply to
educational matters for children in custody; and asked Lisa Averyhart, Law Department, if this new
position will be added to the Law Department and will be working exclusively in the Department of Health
and Human Services. Dale Miller asked why the County is not continuing with The Legal Aid Society of
Cleveland and expressed his concern about increasing the existing heavy workload of the Law
Department; and asked if there is the potential to save money by providing services in-house. Ms. Keenan
indicated that she does not believe there will be the potential for savings as in-school legal services will
include travel time and does not believe this approach is in our best interest. Nan Baker asked if this
transition will occur at the end of the contract and is it the intention that funds in the contract will be
utilized until exhausted. Mr. Nanni asked if this position with the Law Department was posted for this
specific purpose. Ms. Keenan stated that the new attorney was hired specifically for the Division of
Children and Family Services. Maggie Keenan motioned to approve the item; Michael Dever seconded.

 Mike Foley, Director, Department of Sustainability, presented. Dale Miller asked why this was determined
to be an RFP exemption rather than a sole source purchase. Lenora Lockett stated that the request
submitted and presented by the department met the criteria for an RFP exemption and receipt of the sole
source affidavit after the fact, does not comply with the County Code requirements as a sole source
procurement process.
Mr. Miller asked if the sole source or RFP exemption process will be requested, if there is a subsequent
contract. Ms. Lockett stated that a formal, full and open competitive process is always the preferred
method and if that is not the case, then all options will be considered at that time. Nan Baker asked for
clarification on what qualifies as a sole source provider and asked if this vendor meets that criteria. Ms.
Lockett stated that the criteria for sole source includes the vendor certifying by affidavit that they are a
sole source provider of the required service, as well as the department determining this is the only vendor
that can meet the project’s needs; and further stated that the services must be posted for 5 days to ensure
that no other vendors come forward to contradict the vendor’s claim of being a sole source provider. Ms.
Baker recommended that the sole source process be used next time.
Ms. Lockett stated that if the department’s request had met sole source criteria, it would have been
presented as a sole source purchase on the agenda but had instead had been submitted as an RFP
exemption; and indicated that briefings prepared by department’s offer their perspective on the purchase
but the caption on the agenda is the Office of Procurement & Diversity’s proposal, as approved at the
Executive Review Meeting, as to the actual requirements that were met.
Mr. Miller concurred with Ms. Baker’s recommendation to use a sole source process next time. Dale Miller
motioned to approve the item; Michael Dever seconded. Item BC2019-264 was unanimously approved.

CWRU research staff will be compensated $240,000 to conduct evaluative and consultative services for
the Cuyahoga County Veteran’s Treatment Court (VTC) program from 9/30/18 to 9/28/21. CWRU will use
client tracking and reporting systems (GPRA, NOMS, SPARS) and client interviewing procedures (e.g.,
locator data) to inform client service progress and outcomes. The CWRU evaluator/tracker will work
closely with the VTC’s treatment team to track and collect all intake, 6 month and discharge data, and
input data into the SPARS system. Whenever possible, the face-to-face data intake and follow-up
interviews will be conducted in concert with the client’s regularly scheduled treatment or service (e.g.,
employment, housing, etc.) sessions to maximize intake, 6-month, and discharge follow-up contacts. In
addition, clients will receive incentive gift-cards for follow-up interviews. All evaluation protocols,
including informed consent procedures describing risks/benefits of the evaluation, will be approved by
the CWRU Human Subjects Institutional Review Board. Data will be stored on secure password protected
computers located in a secure office at the CWRU Begun Research Center. Data will be managed using
Excel and SPSS software.
CWRU will be responsible for the initial collection, cleaning, management, merging, analysis of data, and
report writing with oversight from the principal and co-principal investigators. The quantitative data
analyses will include the use of descriptive statistics and frequencies to describe the population and
services; T-tests and repeated measures analysis of variance to examine comparative treatment effects

33

 among different client segments, and the impact individual and program factors have on service
outcomes.
A detailed electronic Client Service Log documenting types of services rendered, dosage hours, urinalysis
results, meetings with the VJO, TASC Clinician, Probation Officer, interactions with the VTC Judge in Court,
and Veteran incentives and sanctions will be maintained and uploaded to the CWRU team. All of the data
described above will be collected and analyzed by the evaluators on a continuing basis. If it is discovered
that the program is veering from the prescribed course, the evaluators will report these findings
immediately to the Project Director and the court team for the purposes of quality improvement. Analysis
of the screening tools and baseline interviews will yield descriptive statistics indicating motivation to
change, family functioning, social connectedness, trauma/PTSD prevalence, demographics, treatment
history, criminal justice history SUD use, MH stabilization, and readiness to change. With the longitudinal
GPRA data, CWRU will assess both groups and change scores and calculate a treatment effect to
determine if and to what extent clients are improving on the major outcomes including: AOD use, MAT
access and usage, family and living conditions, education, employment, income, mental and physical
health problems.

Court.
Was the specific project funding included in OBM-approved budget for the current year? If not, please
explain.
Rationale Supporting the Use of the Selected Procurement Method
(include state contract # or GSA contract # and expiration date)
Due to its extensive experience with other previous federally funded SAHMSA projects involving the
Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court, we selected CWRU to serve as the evaluator for the Cuyahoga
County Common Pleas Court’s Veteran’s Treatment Court.
What other available options and/or vendors were evaluated? If none, include the reasons why (Attach
supporting documentation such as other vendor quotes/pricing).
No other available options exist. Similar to other previous federally funded SAHMSA projects, we rely on
the expertise of CWRU’s research staff to conduct the project’s outcome data collection and
34

 performance measurement component of the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court’s Veteran’s
Treatment Court. For years, CWRU has successfully utilized client tracking and reporting systems (GPRA,
NOMS, SPARS) and interviewing procedures (e.g., locator data) with over 90% continual success in
locating clients for follow-up interviews.
What ultimately led you to this product or service? Why was the recommended vendor selected? How
was it determined that the anticipated cost is fair and reasonable? (Attach supporting documentation).
The project’s outcome data collection and performance measurement will be conducted by a CWRU
research team led by Principle Investigator Margaret Baughman Ph.D. Dr. Baughman and her team have
extensive experience in SAMHSA-funded longitudinal evaluations involving adult behavioral health and
criminal justice for the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court’s Veteran’s Treatment Court.
The services being provided are for Evaluation and data collection services related to the implementation
of the DRUG Court / Veteran's Treatment Court. These services will determine the successful
implementation of the DRUG Court / Veteran's Treatment Court (e.g. reduce drug usage and recidivism
of veterans). This will be used at the Common Pleas Court Veteran's DRUG Court/ Treatment Curt and
Probation Department
An RFP exemption is needed as the Principal investigator of the SAMHSA funded DRUG Court Veteran's
Treatment Court Expansion grant has involved a number of CSAT-sponsored projects and is experienced
in all phases of the performance assessment process included data collection and analysis.

were dead, posing a falling hazard. Removal also opened up roadway to more light, giving new overlay
more lifespan.
Reference #77 Message Boards: This was a plan omission and needed to give proper notice to the public
to conditions during construction.
Reference #78 Ditch Cleanout: Existing ditch had accumulated various debris, of which required
excavation to clean and prepare for new rock erosion protection placement.
