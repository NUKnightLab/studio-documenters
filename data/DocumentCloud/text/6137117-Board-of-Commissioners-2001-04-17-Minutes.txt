Co-Sponsors:

Commissioners Allan C. Carr, Gregg Goslin, Carl R. Hansen, Ted Lechowicz, William
R. Moran, Joseph Mario Moreno, Herbert T. Schumann, Jr., Deborah Sims, Bobbie L.
Steele and Calvin R. Sutker

Explanation (purpose) of Amendment:
This amendment substitutes the word "may" for "will" so as to ensure that the Treasurer has flexibility in
the matter of County depositories.

Amends:
B.

Section 4 - County Depositories (B)
Upon receipt of any written complaint regarding predatory lending practices by any financial
institution seeking designation as a County depository or serving as a County depository, the
Chief Financial Officer shall refer such complaints to the Treasurer who will may conduct an
investigation of the complaint in accordance with the Treasurer's policies and procedures.

Leave was granted to add Commissioners Carr, Goslin, Hansen, Lechowicz, Moran, Moreno, Schumann,
Sims, Steele and Sutker as co-sponsors.
Commissioner Silvestri asked if the change in the language of the ordinance, from "will" to "may" is
consistent with the City of Chicago ordinance? He stated the change in terminology will make the
Treasurer's action discretionary.
Chairman Daley responded he believes the language is consistent with the City of Chicago ordinance and
was recommended by the State's Attorney's Office.
Commissioner Lechowicz stated that it was explained to him that the reason for the amendment is
because the County cannot dictate these actions to the Treasurer.
Chairman Daley asked Helen Haynes, Assistant State's Attorney, to address the Committee.
ASA Haynes stated the change in language was recommended in light of the statutes governing the
County Treasurer, and the County Treasurer's discretion in recommending the designation of the County
depository. She continued by stating that it would be more consistent with the statutory authority granted
to the Treasurer if this were something that was transmitted to the Treasurer, where she may then
investigate and take action.

1431

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 17, 2001
Commissioner Silvestri stated his concern ifthe County Treasurer was not willing to work with the Board
of Commissioners, that person would then have the ability to circumvent the purpose of the ordinance.
He indicated that the elected Board of Commissioners should have some authority over the operations of
one of the offices that it funds. He indicated he understands the division of powers and how statutory
authority is given to various elected offices. However, he stated he does not think the Legislature
intended other County elected officials to be totally free from any control exercised by the Board of
Commissioners.
Commissioner Silvestri asked what would happen if this amendment is not approved?
ASA Haynes indicated there could be a Treasurer that objects to the originally proposed language and
takes legal action by suing the Board. In response to Commissioner Lechowicz, ASA Haynes stated she
would provide a briefing on the statutes that govern the Treasurer's authority regarding the issue of
County depositories.
Commissioner Lechowicz remarked that the State has eminent domain on this issue. He said the statutes
are clear as far as certain County offices are concerned as well as the responsibility of the County Board
to that office, and that office to the State of Illinois.
Commissioner Hansen stated the Home Rule powers of the County do not take precedence over the
constitutional powers of the Treasurer. He said the language should be optional so that the County Board
does not run afoul of the constitutional duties of the Treasurer.
Commissioner Butler stated he does not believe that the Treasurer, who is the custodian of the funds, has
powers that supercede that of the Board in terms of where the funds should be deposited. He agrees with
Commissioner Silvestri in that the word "may" leads to ambiguity.
Commissioner Maldonado also agreed with Commissioner Silvestri that the word "may" is too
discretionary, giving the option and subjective discretion to the Treasurer to act upon this or not. He
asked why the State's Attorney's Office suggested the word "may".
ASA Haynes responded that there is one specific statute that allows the Treasurer to request the County
Board to designate a depository, as referenced in sub-point A of Section 4 of the Ordinance. However, in
the instances in which the Treasurer is independently exercising her general constitutional and statutory
authority over funds, there may be a potential problem by directing the Treasurer in a certain manner.
Commissioner Maldonado stated if the ordinance is adopted with the term "will", it is suggested that the
Treasurer has the option of not having to comply with the language of this ordinance. He asked where the
Home Rule power of this County lies?
ASA Haynes responded the powers granted to the County have to be taken in the context of the powers
granted to individually elected officials as well as those provided by statute under the body of law in the
Constitution. She recommended this language be considered as being more consistent with existing law.
Commissioner Lechowicz, seconded by Vice Chairman Carr, moved approval of Amendment #6.
Commissioner Butler called for a Roll Call, the vote of yeas and nays being as follows:

SUBSTITUTE AMENDMENT #8
Sponsor:

Commissioner Carl R. Hansen

Explanation (purpose) of Amendment:

interpretations of the words "reasonably believe."

Amends:

Section 2 - Definitions: "Predatory Loan" (8)

1433

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 17, 2001

(8)

Lending without due regard to repayment ability: The lender makes a loan if the lender 0ees
n.ot reason~ believe~ at the time the loan is consummated that the borrower or the
borrowers (when considered collectively in the case of multiple borrowers) will not be able to
make the scheduled payments to repay the obligation based upon a consideration of their
current and expected income, current obligations, employment status, and other financial
resources (other than the borrower's equity in the dwelling which secures repayment of the
loan). A borrower shall be presumed to be able to make the scheduled payments to repay the
obligation if, at the time the loan is consummated, or at the time of the first rate adjustment in
the case of a lower introductory interest rate, the borrower's scheduled monthly payments on
the loan (including principal, interest, taxes, insurance and assessments), combined with the
scheduled payments for all other debts, do not exceed 50% of the borrower's monthly gross
income as verified by the credit application, the borrower's financial statement, a credit
report, financial information provided to the lender by or on behalf of the borrower, or any
other reasonable means. This provision applies only to borrowers whose income, as reported
on the loan application which the lender relied upon in making the credit decision, is no
greater than 120% of the median family income for the Chicago Metropolitan Statistical Area
(MSA) (as defined by the Director of the U.S. Office of Management and Budget). For
purposes of this Ordinance, the median family income shall be derived from the most recent
estimates made available by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, at the
time the application is received. For purposes of determining median income, only the
income of the borrower or borrowers shall be considered;

Chairman Daley announced that a substitute amendment had been previously distributed.

Commissioner Hansen, seconded by Commissioner Lechowicz, moved approval of Substitute
Amendment #8. The motion carried. Commissioner Moran voted no.
AMENDMENT #9
Sponsor:

Commissioner Peter N. Silvestri

Explanation (purpose) of Amendment:
Most homeowners will need to refinance out of their predatory loans. Thus far, only Harris Bank and
Fannie Mae have developed an alternative product to help those in the midst of a predatory loan. This
alternative product pays off the predatory loan and replaces it with a more conventional loan.

Amends:

Section 2 - Definitions: "Predatory lender"

"Predatory lender" means a financial institution that has made, within the previous 12 month
period, predatory loans that comprise either: (1) 5% of the total annual number of loans made, or (2) 25
individual loans; whichever is less. Each financial institution and affiliate shall be considered separately
for the purposes of these calculations, and only loans secured by residential real estate that is located

Leave was granted to add Commissioners Butler and Collins as co-sponsors.
Commissioner Quigley stated that he is aware the Board cannot regulate the insurance business, and this
amendment does not attempt to do so. The Commissioner said the ordinance addresses the mortgage
industry in the same way that it addresses the insurance industry. He said the Federal Reserve Board has
now recommended that the financing of credit life can be included in points and fees. He stated that
Governor Ryan's proposed regulations not only included credit life in the definition of points and fees,
but prohibits the sale of lump sum credit life in high cost loans. The Commissioner further stated that
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac both refuse to purchase subprime loans that include single premium credit
insurance, and a joint report by HUD and the U.S. Treasury recommends banning this type of product
altogether.
Commissioner Lechowicz stated that amendment #12 effectively bans single premium credit life
insurance. He said this amendment differs from the City's ordinance and would impose very different
requirements on the same lenders governing the same loans. He indicated that the City of Chicago is
going to address this issue, and when the State's Joint Committee on Administrative Rules (JCAR) rules
on the matter, the Board could follow suit. He indicated that the Board should not act prematurely but
should wait to make sure that the State takes the appropriate lead in this critical area. He requested that a
Chicago Tribune article dated March 31, 2001, by Melissa Allison be entered into the record. The article
concerns Governor Ryan's revised rules on lending.

Commissioner Quigley, seconded by Commissioner Butler, moved approval of Amendment #12.
The motion to approve Amendment #12 FAILED. Commissioner Butler, Collins and Quigley voted

Commissioner Quigley stated the amendment follows the recommendations that Governor Ryan and the
Federal Reserve Board have made. The amendment informs citizens that the Board of Commissioners is
concerned about the growing number of foreclosures. He noted the ordinance includes credit life in the
definition of points and fees.
Commissioner Maldonado defined a predatory loan as a threshold loan, that has charges in terms of points
exceeding five percent. He stated the public has testified at the hearings, that most lenders sell single
premium life insurance and share fees with either the broker or lender. As an example, the Commissioner
said if the lender charges $5000 for the premium and it is split with the broker, that means the lender is
charging five points, plus $2500, which on a $100,000 loan means an additional two and half points in
terms of fees. He stated his concern that if the amendment is not approved, there will be more
proliferation of credit life insurance pushed on customers. He supports the adoption of the amendment.
Commissioner Collins stated that the ordinance is not to regulate all banks and financial institutions in
Cook County, but to regulate a few banks where the County has deposits.
Commissioner Lechowicz indicated that the County does not have the authority to regulate certain
institutions. He stated it is the province of the State and that the Joint Committee on Administrative Rules
can address this issue. He noted that adoption of the amendment would be premature.

Section 2 - Definitions: "Predatory Loan" (8)
Lending without due regard to repayment ability: The lender makes a loan if the lender does

lenders must certify that the borrower financially qualify for the proposed m 1tgage and that
the borrower's income is sufficient at the time of the loan to amortized the mortgage in
accordance with the agreed mo11gage term . TF, after the mortgage is issue and the
amortization commenced it is determined that the borrower did not financially qualify for the
subject mortgage at the time of iss uance, than the mortgage shall be deemed to ha e been

afi rementioned shall be eq uall y app licable to all originatin g, servicin g and subseq uent

make the scheduled payments to repay the obligation if, at the time the loan is consummated,
or at the time of the first rate adjustment in the case of a lower introductory interest rate, the
borrower's scheduled monthly payments on the loan (including principal, interest, taxes,
insurance and assessments), combined with the scheduled payments for all other debts, do not
exceed 50% of the borrower's monthly gross income as verified by the credit application, the
borrower's financial statement, a credit report, financial information provided to the lender by
or on behalf of the borrower, or any other reasonable means. This provision applies only to
borrowers whose income, as reported on the loan application which the lender relied upon in
making the credit decision, is no greater than 120% of the median family income for the
Chicago Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) (as defined by the Director of the U.S. Office
of Management and Budget). For purposes of this Ordinance, the median family income
shall be derived from the most recent estimates made available by the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development, at the time the application is received. For purposes of
determining median income, only the income of the borrower or borrowers shall be
considered;

Commissioner Collins indicated Amendment #18 puts the responsibility on the mortgage broker or the
lender. The Commissioner said there are specific rules, practices and procedures that must be followed
to determine whether or not a person can afford to repay the loan, especially when one looks at home
equity loans to ensure that people do not lose their property. The Commissioner said the Amendment
requires the lender to certify the person and to determine that the borrower has the financial ability to pay
the loan in accordance with the terms of the loan. She indicated that the borrower will receive a copy of
the certification signed by the mortgagor saying that they have validated the fact that this person has the
financial ability to repay the loan.
Commissioner Lechowicz asked ASA Haynes if she had an opportunity to review Amendment # 18?

1440

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 17, 2001
ASA Haynes answered that she did review Amendment # 18 and appreciates the concern it addresses. She
said the State has a broader ability to regulate the practice of banking and that this amendment would
appear to impose an affirmative requirement that lenders enter into a certification that the borrower has
the ability to repay the loan. From a legal standpoint, ASA Haynes indicated that it may appear to be
regulating banking in a manner that goes beyond the County's authority. She indicated there are no real
criteria set forth in this ordinance by which a lender can make that certification. She indicated there are
general standards out there and did not know whether or not it is currently widespread practice to make a
certification like this. She did not think such standards are set forth in the amendment. ASA Haynes also
stated there is a significant issue as to whether or not the County may be going a step beyond what the
ordinance intends.
Commissioner Collins said the intent of the amendment is to certify and validate that the borrower's
income can support the mortgage payments.
Ms. Haynes indicated the amendment seeks general certification and one that is keyed to a specific
Federal law. She said it imposes an affirmative obligation upon the lender and would declare that a
mortgage, which was issued and for which the borrower did not financially qualify, would appear to have
been issued under fraudulent terms, which is a statement that may go beyond what actually happened.
ASA Haynes commented that under the amendment, the mortgage would be deemed null and void. Ms.
Haynes concluded that she does not think the County Board can promulgate an ordinance that would have
the authority to declare a mortgage null and void.
Commissioner Lechowicz advised the committee to follow the Assistant State's Attorney's advice that
the County Board does not have certain jurisdictional powers over financial institutions in this County or
State. He said he had serious reservations and did not think this amendment should be considered at this
time, based upon the State's Attorney's recommendation.
Commissioner Steele concurred with Commissioner Lechowicz and indicated that the State has greater
powers than Cook County.
Commissioner Collins, seconded by Commissioner Quigley, moved approval of Amendment #18.

The financing of points and fees in excess of 6% of the loan amount.

(7)

The financing of a single premium credit life, credit disability, credit unemployment, or any
other life or health insurance, directly or indirectly, into one or more threshold loans unless
the lender, at least three business days before the borrower signs the loan agreement, makes
to the borrower a separate oral disclosure, and a separate clear and conspicuous written
disclosure containing the following information, all of which must be true: (i) the total cost
of the insurance premium and, separately stated, the total amount of interest that will be
charged for the financing of the insurance premium over the life of the loan; (ii) the fact
that the insurance will be prepaid and financed at the interest rate provided for in the loan;

Lending without due regard to repayment ability: The lender makes a loan if the lender
does Rot reasoRa9ly believe~ at the time the loan is consummated that the borrower or the
borrowers (when considered collectively in the case of multiple borrowers) will not be able
to make the scheduled payments to repay the obligation based upon a consideration of their
current and expected income, current obligations, employment status, and other financial
resources (other than the borrower's equity in the dwelling which secures repayment of the
loan). A borrower shall be presumed to be able to make the scheduled payments to repay
the obligation if, at the time the loan is consummated, or at the time of the first rate
adjustment in the case of a lower introductory interest rate, the borrower's scheduled
monthly payments on the loan (including principal, interest, taxes, insurance and
assessments), combined with the scheduled payments for all other debts, do not exceed
50% of the borrower's monthly gross income as verified by the credit application, the
borrower's financial statement, a credit report, financial information provided to the lender
by or on behalf of the borrower, or any other reasonable means. This provision applies
only to borrowers whose income, as reported on the loan application which the lender
relied upon in making the credit decision, is no greater than 120% of the median family
income for the Chicago Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) (as defined by the Director of
the U.S. Office of Management and Budget). For purposes of this Ordinance, the median
family income shall be derived from the most recent estimates made available by the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development, at the time the application is received.
For purposes of determining median income, only the income of the borrower or borrowers
shall be considered;

(9)

The payment by a lender to a contractor under a home improvement contract from the
proceeds of a threshold loan, other than:
(i)

by an instrument payable to the borrower or jointly to the borrower and the contractor;
or

(ii) at the election of the borrower, by a third party escrow agent in accordance with terms
established in a written agreement signed by the borrower, the lender, and the
contractor before the date of payment;
( 10) The payment from loan proceeds by a lender to a contractor under a home repair or
improvement contract, where the contractor has been, on two or more occasions within the
previous 24 month period, determined by a court or agency of competent jurisdiction to be
in violation of any law or ordinance prohibiting deceptive practices or similar conduct,
unless: (i) the lender has no knowledge of the determinations, and (ii) the lender has
received a written affidavit from the contractor stating that there have not been two or more
such determinations regarding the contractor within the previous 24 month period.
(11) Such other circumstances that the Chief Financial Officer may determine to be predatory in
nature, in administrative rules promulgated to implement this Ordinance, which rules shall
be submitted to the Cook County Board of Commissioners for their approval.

Commissioners, may suspend the ineligibility of a financial institution in order to allow
execution of a contract with the financial institution upon written application by the head of
a County agency or department affected by the proposed contract setting forth facts
sufficient in the judgment of the purchasing agent to establish:

1.

that the public health, safety or welfare of the County requires the goods or services of
the financial institution; and

2.

that the County is unable to acquire the goods or services at comparable price and
quality, and in sufficient quantity, from other sources.

SECTION 4 - COUNTY DEPOSITORIES
A.

All financial institutions, seeking designation as a County depository by the Board of
Commissioners upon the request of the Treasurer, shall submit to the Chief Financial

institution acceptable to the Chief Financial Officer. The pledge shall be in substantially
the following form:
We pledge that we are not and will not become a predatory lender as
defined in this Ordinance. We further pledge that none of our affiliates
is, and none of them will become, a predatory lender as defined in this
Ordinance.
We understand that becoming a predatory lender or
becoming an affiliate of a predatory lender may result in the loss of our
designation as a County depository.

B.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 17, 2001

241445

AN ORDINANCE DIRECTING COOK COUNTY TO ADOPT LEADERSHIP IN
ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL DESIGN (LEED) GREEN BUILDING RATING
SYSTEM FOR ALL NEWLY CONSTRUCTED COUNTY FACILITIES (PROPOSED
ORDINANCE). Submitting a Proposed Ordinance sponsored by Mike Quigley, County
Commissioner; Co-Sponsored by William R. Moran and Herbert T. Schumann, County
Commissioners:
The following is a synopsis of the Proposed Ordinance:
PROPOSED ORDINANCE
WHEREAS, the United States Green Building Council (USGBC), a non-profit, nationally
recognized association with membership representing all segments of the building industry,
including architects, manufacturers, government agencies, and environmentalists, has created
LEED, a green building rating system that provides specific principles and practices, some
mandatory but the majority discretionary, that may be applied during the design, construction,
and operation phases, which enable the building to be awarded points from reaching preset
standards of environmental efficiency so that it may achieve LEED certification from the
USGBC as a "green" building; and
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED,
I.

That Cook County does hereby order all of its newly constructed buildings to employ
the LEED Green Building Rating System, Version 2.0, throughout their design,
construction, and operation and does further order that each new building must
achieve the LEED silver level of certification.

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED,
II.

That the USGBC intends to release a revised version of the LEED Green Building
Rating System every three years; and with this in consideration when beginning a
new building project, Cook County shall refer to the most current version of the
LEED in existence; and after registering with the USGBC at the design stage of the
project as is required, the County may adhere to that existing version until completion
of the project, regardless of any new LEED version that may be released at a later
time.

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED,
Ill.

That with specific regard to the LEED Energy and Atmosphere category, because
achieving increasing levels of energy performance above the set energy code
standards is the surest way of realizing significant operational cost savings, all
buildings must obtain a total of at least eight points.

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED,
IV.

NOTE:

That Cook County also encourages the application of LEED principles during retrofit
and renovation projects of its current standing structures whenever it is practicable.
This matter was also referred to the Committee on Environmental Control. (See
Comm. No. 241446).

OFFICE OF CAPITAL PLANNING AND POLICY, by Michael E. LaMont, Director,

requesting approval of a Contract Amendment to the contract with VERNON WILLIAMS
ARCHITECTS, P.C., Chicago, Illinois, architect for Englewood Healthcare Center in the
amount of $18,812.50. It is respectfully requested that this Honorable Body approve this
request.
Reason:

This amendment provides for additional services necessary for landscaping
revisions and additional construction administration services which were
necessary due to a delay in the completion of the project. The funds for these
services will be taken out of the liquidated damages which will be charged to the
contractor.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $18,812.50. Bond Issue (28000 Account).
Commissioner Silvestri asked if liquidated damages will in fact be charged to the contractor?
Michael LaMont responded that the contractor is four months behind in completing the project and
contract provides for assessment of liquidated damages if the project is not completed on time. He further
stated that the contractor has no valid reason for not completing the project on time and damages are
being assessed.
Commissioner Silvestri asked if the facility is already complete?
Mr. LaMont stated that the facility is complete.
Commissioner Collins asked Mr. LaMont to clarify exactly how the liquidated damages will be recouped
by the County.
Mr. LaMont commented that the method to recoup liquidated damages is during the final contract
settlement where a deduction is made from the final payout. He said the only way the County can adjust
a contract is with Board approval, and concluded that the funds will be recovered through the amount
credited to the contractor for late performance.
Commissioner Sims asked ifthe damages could be recouped through errors and omissions?
Mr. LaMont answered that the damages could not be recovered through errors and omissions.

241446

AN ORDINANCE DIRECTING COOK COUNTY TO ADOPT LEADERSHIP IN
ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL DESIGN (LEED) GREEN BUILDING RA TING
SYSTEM FOR ALL NEWLY CONSTRUCTED COUNTY FACILITIES (PROPOSED
ORDINANCE). Submitting a Proposed Ordinance sponsored by Mike Quigley, County
Commissioner; Co-Sponsored by William R. Moran and Herbert T. Schumann, County
Commissioners:
The following is a synopsis of the Proposed Ordinance:
PROPOSED ORDINANCE
WHEREAS, the United States Green Building Council (USGBC), a non-profit, nationally
recognized association with membership representing all segments of the building industry,
including architects, manufacturers, government agencies, and environmentalists, has created
LEED, a green building rating system that provides specific principles and practices, some
mandatory but the majority discretionary, that may be applied during the design, construction,
and operation phases, which enable the building to be awarded points from reaching preset
standards of environmental efficiency so that it may achieve LEED certification from the
USGBC as a "green" building; and
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED,
I.

That Cook County does hereby order all of its newly constructed buildings to employ
the LEED Green Building Rating System, Version 2.0, throughout their design,
construction, and operation and does further order that each new building must
achieve the LEED silver level of certification.

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED,
II.

That the USGBC intends to release a revised version of the LEED Green Building
Rating System every three years; and with this in consideration when beginning a
new building project, Cook County shall refer to the most current version of the
LEED in existence; and after registering with the USGBC at the design stage of the
project as is required, the County may adhere to that existing version until completion
of the project, regardless of any new LEED version that may be released at a later
time.

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED,
III.

That with specific regard to the LEED Energy and Atmosphere category, because
achieving increasing levels of energy performance above the set energy code
standards is the surest way of realizing significant operational cost savings, all
buildings must obtain a total of at least eight points.

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED,
IV.
NOTE:

That Cook County also encourages the application of LEED principles during retrofit
and renovation projects of its current standing structures whenever it is practicable.
This matter was also referred to the Committee on Construction. (See Comm.
No. 241445).

Chairman Moreno asked Commissioner Quigley to give background information regarding the proposed
ordinance.

1495

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 17, 2001
Commissioner Quigley commented about personal experiences during the first energy crisis when fewer
lights were used that year and smaller vehicles were purchased. He also said that same year the Gross
Nation.al Product (GNP) rose and energy consumption stayed the same. He stated that somewhere during
the l 970's through the 1990's, when OPEC released more oil and energy consumption rose, the U.S. lost
some lessons on energy savings.
Commissioner Quigley said today, when we hear of energy blackouts in California and of people in
Chicago who are unable to pay their heating bills, perhaps those lessons are coming back to us. He said
he thinks it is appropriate for government, particularly Cook County, to take a leadership role in moving
toward those energy efficiencies that were supposed to be learned some time ago.
The commissioner said the proposed ordinance stems from his visit to San Francisco, California that had
already passed a Green Building Ordinance that involved buildings the city built rather than buildings
outside of their jurisdiction. He stated the San Francisco ordinance did not follow the LEED standard, but
did give him the idea that Cook County should do something similar. He further said that discussions
with representatives of the Environmental Law and Policy Center focused on the Green Buildings Council
and the LEED's standard for buildings and building efficiency. Commissioner Quigley stated that the
LEED's standard not only covers building efficiency but also environmental qualities, orientations,
worker productivity, air quality and many other areas of concern to the County. He stated that the
ordinance is one way Cook County can take the lead in resolving energy efficiency problems.
The following speakers provided testimony on the proposed ordinance:
Helen Kessler, Executive Vice President, Sieben Energy Consultants
Karen J. Lewis, Environmental Law & Policy Center
Theodore P. Georgas, Chief Engineer, Cook County Highway Department
Chairman Moreno and Commissioner Silvestri asked to be listed as co-sponsors to the ordinance.
Chairman Moreno commented that he believes every commissioner is in favor of Cook County taking the
initiative on energy conservation and the environment; however, he said the county also needs to look at
the cost and maintenance associated with any new construction as it relates to the proposed ordinance.
Commissioner Silvestri stated that initially, new construction would probably cost more using the
standards in the proposed ordinance, but in the long run by approving the ordinance, taxpayer dollars will
be saved along with helping our children and the environment.
Commissioner Moran informed the subcommittee that he had recently attended a Department of Energy
Conference where the very same issue was discussed . The commissioner shared information regarding
Cook County's proposed ordinance at the meeting and was told that the possibility exists that a mandate
calling for all public buildings to conform to the LEED's example could become an unfunded mandate.
He said he supports the ordinance and Commissioner Quigley is on target with this proposal.
In response to comments made by Ted Georgios, Chief Engineer, Cook County Highway Department,
regarding a possible exemption to the ordinance for "no or low occupancy structures," Commissioner
Quigley stated that these structures should be exempt and he plans to make this a part of the proposed
ordinance. The commissioner further stated that the ordinance only applies to new buildings that will be
constructed after passage.
Chairman Moreno asked Michael LaMont, Director, Office of Capital Planning and Policy to give the
subcommittee an idea on how and where the county is moving on energy efficiency and this concept.

1496

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 17, 2001

Michael LaMont stated that the Office of Capital Planning and Policy has already considered energy
conservation and recycling as buildings are renovated and updated, particularly in the area of lighting. He
said that for the past five years, on retrofit projects, "green lights" have been successfully retrofitted in
various buildings. He further stated that the Office of Capital Planning and Policy is currently working
on the "Green Lights Fixture Replacement Project" that is more comprehensive, especially on the use of
energy efficient light fixtures. Mr. LaMont stated that the Board has already approved Phase I of the
project that includes outlying court buildings and Phase II includes all other buildings. He concluded by
stating that the Office will look at all criteria in the proposed ordinance as it relates to cost.
Commissioner Silvestri asked when the Office of Capital Planning and Policy will present a report to the
members.
Michael LaMont responded he plans to meet with staff, other county departments, and the Industrial
Engineers to thoroughly review the proposed ordinance. He concluded by stating that he will provide a
status report to the members within 30 to 60 days.
Vice Chairman Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Schumann, moved the deferral of
Communication No. 241446 until the Office of Capital Planning and Policy prepares a fiscal impact
statement. The motion carried.
Vice Chairman Silvestri moved to adjourn the meeting, seconded by Commissioner Moran. The
motion carried and the meeting was adjourned.

RESOLUTION SUPPORTING HOUSE BILL 2392 (PROPOSED RESOLUTION).
Submitting a Proposed Resolution sponsored by Mike Quigley, County Commissioner.
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, many residential areas of Cook County are rapidly developing, as evidenced by
the recent construction of many new property developments, condominium units and
subdivisions throughout the County; and
WHEREAS, under current state law, a grantor may transfer ownership of a new residential
parcel to a grantee without providing a property index number (PIN) and in fact, many of
these newly built or newly divided properties are sold prior to assignment of proper property
index numbers by the Cook County Assessor; and
WHEREAS, the sale of parcels that have not yet been divided by the Cook County Assessor's
Office leads to imprecise billing of individual property owners, which can result in
overpayments, underpayments and penalties, creating confusion and frustration on the part of
these new homeowners; and
WHEREAS, the resulting confusion and frustration of these homeowners severely strains the
resources of the Cook County Assessor's Office and the Cook County Commissioners; and
WHEREAS, State Representatives Judy Erwin, Jim Brosnahan, Sara Feigenholtz, Julie
Harnos and the State Senator Christine Radogno have sponsored House Bill 2392, a bill only
affecting Cook County, which would require a grantor of property to provide the grantee with
an individual permanent index number that specifically represents that parcel of property
which that grantee has purchased; and
WHEREAS, House Bill 2392 also provides that if the permanent index number does not
represent the legal description of the property, the grantor may supply proof that he or she
either filed an application for division of the property with the Cook County Assessor's
Office, recorded a plat of subdivision, or recorded a condominium declaration; and
WHEREAS, a grantor's failure to meet these requirements will not invalidate the transaction,
but will render a grantor personally liable to grantee for any taxes and attorney's fees that may
be incurred until the requirements are met; and
NOW, THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, the Cook County Assessor's Office and the Cook
County Board of Commissioners support this legislation, recently passed unanimously by the
House Judiciary I Committee.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners does hereby
urge the Illinois State Legislature to support this effort to facilitate the payment of accurate
property taxes by residential property owners in Cook County; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that this text be spread upon the official proceedings of this
Honorable Body, and a suitable copy of same be provided to the Illinois State Legislature.

In response to Commissioner Silvestri's request to hear from a representative of the Assessor's Office on
House Bill 2392, Terry Steczo stated the Assessor's Office is very supportive of the Resolution and House
Bill 2392.

1499

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 17, 2001
Mr. Steczo stated the intent of the bill is not only to ensure the proper conveyance and accuracy of
property records but also, to protect the county and purchasers of such property from the costly impact of
improper conveyances.
He explained the measure would require a developer to provide a Property Index Number (PIN) as
recorded with the legal description of the property, or to show proof that the application for division
petition for a separate PIN has been filed with the Assessor's Office.
Commissioner Silvestri requested information from Helen Haynes of the State's Attorney's Office, on the
feasibility of implementing and enforcing the measure pursuant to the County's home rule authority.
Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Moran, moved the approval of Communication
No. 242723. The motion carried unanimously.

the time of permitting, the facility was exempt from local siting approval.

In response to Commissioner Silvestri's request for further information, Steve Morrill stated that in 1987
Cook County approved special use zoning approval for a landfill in the Northwestern unincorporated area
of the county and the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency issued a permit. He explained that the
landfill question had been in the courts and just recently a US Supreme Court decision came down in
support of the authority of local agencies to proceed with such use. Mr. Morrill stated this bill was
introduced by individuals who were not happy with this decision and wish to stop the local agencies from
moving forward with the project.

In response to Commissioner Lechowicz, Steve Morrill stated that the bill results from a recent decision
by the IL Supreme Court that affirmed the one-year time limitation for filings against public hospitals.
He explained the bill is drafted for the statutory change based on the dissenting opinion in this case.
Commissioner Lechowicz requested further information from Helen Haynes, of the State's Attorney's
Office, regarding past county cases. He asked for a comparison of the number of filings less than one
year and the estimated number beyond one year, including an estimated increase in costs the county might
face if this bill becomes law.

HB 27 (Leitch) - Gives townships certain demolition authority, pursuant to
application with and order by a court, if a county first declines or fails to act on a
formal request by the township.

In response to Commissioner Daley's question, Steve Morrill stated the President opposed the measure as
currently drafted.
Commissioner Silvestri stated that since the county has no funding, beyond Community Development
Block Grants, to demolish buildings and therefore has limited use of this authority, he believes there
would be no negative impact on the county if this bill were to pass.
