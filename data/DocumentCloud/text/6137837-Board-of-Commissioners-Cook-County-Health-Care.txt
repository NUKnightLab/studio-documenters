II. Provider Presentations (see attached)
Medical Home Network, Building Partnerships for Better Health (MHN) conducted a PowerPoint
presentation and demonstration. PowerPoint attached. MHN was initially funded by foundations.
MHN began its relationship with Cook County by establishing a pilot program with CCHHS. It provides
an e-consult system. It does not completely replace IRIS (spelling?). The pilot program only included
CountyCare patients. It is now expanding to all CCHHS patients.
MHN system allows primary care doctors to consult with specialists. Response time is 48 hours. It is an
effort to decrease the number of unnecessary referrals to specialty care. Results: Less than 40% of econsults resulted in a face to face referral.
MHN system shifts work from specialists to primary care. Patient may still have to schedule multiple
visits however they may continue to receive care in medical home if specialty care is deemed
unnecessary.
