GENERAL BACKGROUND
As part of the Capital Improvement Program, the Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) solicited
bids to perform demolition work at two (2) developments and seven (7) non-dwelling locations.
These structures no longer serve a useful purpose and their demolition is needed as part of the
ongoing renovation of CHA developments as part of the Plan for Transformation. The
demolition work was divided among four (4) groups. Only Groups C and D are being awarded at
this time. Group C is made up of four (4) non-dwelling buildings, and Group D consists of a
single non-dwelling building. Groups A and B will be re-solicited and awarded separately at a
later date. Demolition, site work and landscaping is to be completed within three hundred sixtyfive (365) calendar days of the date set forth in the Notice to Proceed.
PROCUREMENT HISTORY
The CHA advertised Invitation for Bid (IFB) No. 10 – 00508 on March 19, 2010 for the
demolition of two (2) developments and seven (7) non-dwelling buildings. The IFB was
advertised in the Chicago Sun-Times, the Chicago Defender and El Dia, and on the CHA website
and BuySpeed Online. The Pre-bid meeting and Site Visit were held on March 24, 2010. The
CHA issued Addendum No. 1 on March 31, 2010. It answered Requests for Information,
distributed an updated spreadsheet, and provided the latest Davis-Bacon wage determination.
The CHA received and opened six (6) bids on April 8, 2010 at 11:00 am.
After reviewing the bid submittal materials, the Department of Procurement and Contracts and
the Capital Construction Department held pre-award survey meetings with the lowest apparent
bidder in each Group. Each firm responded to questions on the thoroughness of its bid and its
capacity to perform this work. With the reviews, analysis and meetings completed, the
Department of Procurement and Contracts has determined that Delta Demolition, Inc. is the
lowest responsive and responsible bidder for Group C at $489,500.00 and Group D at
$78,900.00, for an aggregate lump sum base bid total of $568,400.00.
Based on the foregoing, it is in the CHA’s best interest for the Board of Commissioners to
authorize the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to execute a contract with Delta
Demolition, Inc. for Group C and D buildings for an aggregate firm fixed fee of $568,400.00.
The demolition work and associated site work and landscaping is to be completed within three
hundred sixty-five (365) calendar days of the date set forth in the Notice to Proceed.
This award is subject to the Contractor’s compliance with the CHA’s MBE/WBE/DBE, Section
3 resident hiring, and bonding and insurance requirements.
