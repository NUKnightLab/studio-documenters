contract with Hyland Software that was held and asked if these services would have been covered under
that contract, if it had been approved; asked if Hyland Software was providing services since January
without a contract and if they have billed the County; asked if the department had any discussions with
Hyland Software regarding billing and asked for confirmation that Hyland Software will be receiving
money from this contract; asked why wasn’t the process started earlier given the importance of the
Enterprise Resource Planning Project and the known public issues with Hyland Software; asked why the
contract was not brought forward sooner and when the process was started; asked what contributed to
the delay; commented that he did not believe this item was delayed in the vendor’s legal department for
6 months; and asked what was the amount of the Hyland Software maintenance contract presented in
June.
Dennis Kennedy commented that although it was requested repeatedly for several years, the
administration was never provided the opportunity to see the Infor product being installed elsewhere;
stated that similar issues occurred with the Sherpa budget module for Infor integration and it did not
survive testing and that due to the project schedule, it would be prohibitive to seek alternatives; asked if
the County is released from any financial liability to Hyland Software by contracting with reseller,
Northwoods Consulting Partners Inc. and does the agreement contain language stating the same.
Jerad Zibritosky, Department of Law stated that Northwoods Consulting Partners Inc. would be paid for
services.
Dale Miller asked for clarification on the time period and how much of the total contract amount is owed
for services provided from 1/1/2019 to present and how much is for the remainder of the contract term;
asked if the amount is substantial for services already provided and if costs will be prorated over a 13month period and will be approximately $20,000.00 per month; asked what kind of work is involved to
maintain licensing that would require $20,000.00 per month; asked how many staff would be required
for this support and does it include programming services; asked how many suppliers are there that can
potentially provide these services and how many quotes were sought for this request; asked how much
did the pricing vary among quotes; asked if we are paying for the same services that Hyland provided from
January through July, 2019 and are any funds still owed to Hyland and if that is the case, we do not want
to pay Northwoods Consulting Partners Inc. for the same services; asked what was last date of services
provided by Hyland Software and if any services were provided from July to present that the charges
should be minimal; stated that he did not want to vote on this item under the presumption that the County
is not liable to Hyland Software for any costs and recommended the Administration seek out the answers
to these issues and that a firm payment arrangement be reached.

18

 Nan Baker asked for clarification on the time period and asked for confirmation that no additional funds
will be needed for this time period; asked if Hyland Software believes they are still owed money and if so,
for what period of time; concurred with Mr. Miller that we need to confirm the amount owed and believes
dates should be revised to be more in line with the actual services; asked if Northwoods Consulting
Partners Inc. would be presenting an invoice for services; asked why 40% of the funding is out of the
Health and Human Services Levy Fund; asked if the contract is for maintenance and support only or does
it include licensing; asked if the contract time period should be changed to begin on the date of Board
approval; and asked why were services from Hyland Software authorized without a contract.
Dennis Kennedy recommended that the item be held so that a meeting could be arranged by the
Department of Information Technology to further discuss these issues. All Board members concurred with
Mr. Kennedy’s recommendation.

Scope of Work Summary
The Department of Public Works requesting approval of RQ#46163 for a revenue generating license
agreement with DigitalC for an anticipated revenue of $10 per year for a 10-year term.
This project is new to the County. It will be for a license agreement to place an antenna, with four fixed
wireless sector radios and one point to point radio, on top of the Juvenile Justice Center cover of a portion
of the Fairfax Neighborhood (census tracks 1135 and 1136) with a wireless internet access. The wireless
network will then allow DigitalC to provide residents with affordable, reliable, sustainable fixed wireless
broadband through an alternative ISP model. The anticipated start-completion dates are July 8, 2019
through July 7, 2029.
The primary goal of the project is to expand digital access in an underserved neighborhood. The 2017
American Community Survey states that 24.9% of Cuyahoga County households do not have internet
access of any kind in the home. That percentage increases to over 35% when looking at the City of
Cleveland and even higher in many of the census tracts on the east side of Cleveland. Lack of access is
also highly correlated with household income. Over half of households with less than $20,000 a year in
33

 annual income do not have internet access in the home, while only 6% of those with annual income higher
than $75,000 lack access.
This item was reviewed and approved by TAC on June 20, 2019.
Procurement
The procurement method for this project was an RFP - Exemption. The total value of the license
agreement is $100.00.

This was originally put out for an informal bid for 500 blankets and the lowest complete bid was
selected. However, due to a recommendation by the ADAMS Board, this quantity was determined to be

Due to the recent deaths in the jail from suicide, the increase in prevention measures is a critical need
that must be addressed immediately.
An RFP exemption is being used because the blankets need to be brought into jail as soon as possible,
