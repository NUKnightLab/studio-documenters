COMMEMORATING THE LIFE AND MEMORY OF THEODORE GREEN
WHEREAS, Ted Green spent nearly two decades of his life as a Cook County Assistant Public Defender
where he was well known and respected by his peers and his adversaries alike for his diligence and devotion
to fighting for every client’s constitutional rights; and
WHEREAS, Ted Green was born and raised in Atlanta, Georgia and was the oldest of eight (8) siblings.
He excelled as a student at Booker T. Washington High School and attended Clark Atlanta University.
Later he graduated from the George Washington University Law School in Washington, D.C. and set out
to pursue his dream of becoming a lawyer; and
WHEREAS, as a young lawyer, Ted Green moved to Chicago and began his work with the Cook County
Public Defender’s office a year later. He rose through the ranks and, because of his legal aptitude, his
profound compassion and rapport with his clients, he was selected to join the elite Murder Task Force
division of the Cook County Public Defender; and
WHEREAS, during the time that Ted Green spent fighting for the lives of his clients on the Murder Task
Force, the climate was particularly hostile and societal compassion for poor defendants facing death was at
its nadir. It was a difficult time to be a defense attorney fighting for the life of a client; it was an even more
difficult time to be a defense attorney for multitudes of clients whose extreme poverty and deprivation left
them deeply troubled. With that as a backdrop, Ted became known, not just as an attorney who was
meticulously prepared and skilled as a litigator but as one who genuinely believed and valued the humanity
of each of his clients and treated them and their families with dignity and respect; and
WHEREAS, in 1984, Ted Green left the public defender’s office and went into private practice in Chicago.
After several decades he returned to the Public Defender’s office in 2003 as a supervisor for trial lawyers
working in the First Municipal District courts and remained there until his untimely death at the age of 66;
and
WHEREAS, Ted Green was a generous and tireless mentor to countless young attorneys at the Public
Defender’s Office. His wisdom and guidance helped shape the next generation of Public Defenders and his
calm and thoughtful demeanor made him an excellent model for all lawyers; and

WHEREAS, Ted Green will be sorely missed by his daughter, Brandi Green and his seven (7) siblings,
Teala Goode, Camille Collier, Stacy Collier, Pamela Collier, Tracy Collier, Craig Collier and Chauncy
Collier; and
WHEREAS, Ted Green will long be remembered for his thorough work and achievement, his high ethical
and moral standards, professionalism, and excellent character. Above all, he will be remembered as a model
of decorum and affability; he was uniformly referred to as a real “Southern gentleman”.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County, on behalf
of the 5.2 million residents of Cook County commemorates the extraordinary life of Theodore Green, and
herewith expresses its sincere gratitude for the invaluable contributions he has made to the Citizens of Cook
County, Illinois; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a suitable copy of this Resolution be spread upon the official
proceedings of this Honorable Body and that an official copy of the same be tendered to the family of
Theodore Green.

COMMEMORATING THE EXTRAORDINARY LIFE,
ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND MEMORY OF JANET OTWELL
WHEREAS, Jan Otwell, former President of the League of Women Voters of Illinois, Director of the
Illinois Department of Aging and a tireless advocate and community volunteer died on February 23, 2015
leaving behind countless friends, family and a community profoundly enriched for having known her; and
WHEREAS, Jan Otwell championed the value of civic engagement over a long life of volunteer and public
service. She inspired Illinois citizens to greater awareness of public issues and participation in the
democratic process through her leadership in the community, her service in state government, and her time
spent volunteering in social service agencies; and
WHEREAS, Jan Otwell grew up in suburban Philadelphia and came to Illinois to study journalism at
Northwestern University in Evanston. She received undergraduate and graduate degrees in journalism, and

Page 8 of 170

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

April 1, 2015

it was while working on the Daily Northwestern newspaper that she met her husband Ralph Otwell. He was
a reporter and she was his managing editor. Jan and Ralph had three sons and, while Ralph rose through
the ranks in journalism to become a top editor at the Chicago Sun-Times, Jan focused her energies on the
family and became a valued volunteer in the community; and
WHEREAS, Jan Otwell was a member of the Illinois League state board from 1968 to 1981, and served
as its President from 1977 to 1981. During this time she spearheaded the League’s effort to ratify the Equal
Rights Amendment in Illinois, and directed the Illinois Juvenile Court Watching Project, which was funded
through the Illinois League. As President, she chose to take the Illinois League Convention to the
neighboring state of Wisconsin after Illinois refused to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA). In
recognition for her decades of hard work and dedication to the League of Women Voters she was honored
with the Carrie Chapman Catt Award, the highest honor the League bestows; and
WHEREAS, Jan Otwell was a tireless leader and advocate for the aging. Despite her being a life-long
Democrat, Republican Governor Jim Thompson appointed her to head the Illinois Department on Aging.
During her seven years in Governor Thompson’s cabinet, she focused her energies on fighting elder abuse
and neglect and to extend quality of life. One of her initiatives, "Ninety for the '90s," was a groundbreaking
networking program that drew together leaders from business, labor, communications, health and religion
to study and report on issues facing aging Illinoisans. She created the Task Force on the Status of Older
Women in Illinois and later became the Midwest Director of the AARP; and
WHEREAS, Jan Otwell was appointed to and served on the Task Force on the Future of Illinois, the Bureau
of Employment Security Advisory Board, and the White House Conference on Families. She served as
Coordinator of the Governor’s Task Force on Children and she was chairperson of the Long Term Care
Committee of the National Association on State Units on Aging. She also chaired the Department of
Children and Family Services Advisory Council; and
WHEREAS, Jan Otwell’s commitment to her community was not limited to civics. Jan spent substantial
time working to improve the lives of children, women, and the homeless through her involvement with
Voices for Illinois Children, the Good News Partners and Deborah’s Place; and
WHEREAS, while being universally regarded as a dedicated team player, Jan Otwell’s exceptional abilities
regularly singled her out for distinction. In addition to many other recognitions and awards she was honored
by the Chicago Metro Chapter of the National Caucus and Center on Black Aged for her efforts to improve
the lives of the minority elderly. She received the first annual Wise Older Woman Award from the White
Crane Senior Health Center in Chicago, the Northwestern Club of Chicago Community Service Award,
and the “Friend of Children” award from the Child Care Association of Illinois and, for her work with the
Intergenerational Initiative, she received the “Champion” award; and
WHEREAS, Jan Otwell’s unfailing loyalty and her great generosity of spirit won her the affection and
respect of the community. She was a role model for all who knew her and will be deeply missed. Jan Otwell
and her husband Ralph resided in Evanston for nearly 31 years and the community has lost a treasured
leader. Her loss will be felt even more acutely by her husband Ralph Otwell and their sons Brian, Douglas
and David; their five (5) grandchildren; and one great-granddaughter.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County, on behalf
of the 5.2 million residents of Cook County commemorates the extraordinary life of Janet Otwell, and
herewith expresses its sincere gratitude for the invaluable contributions she has made to the Citizens of
Cook County, Illinois; and

HONORING THE 47TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING ACT
AND PROCLAIMING THE MONTH OF APRIL FAIR HOUSING MONTH IN COOK COUNTY
WHEREAS, April 2015 marks the 47th Anniversary of the passage of the U.S. Federal Fair Housing act.
Adopted in the wake of the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., the Fair Housing Act transformed

WHEREAS, the U.S. Fair Housing Act created a national policy of fair housing and today prohibits
discrimination based on race, color, religion, national origin, sex, familial status or disability; and

prohibits discrimination in housing based on race, color religion, national origin, sex, physical or mental
disability, familial status, age, ancestry, marital status, disability, military status, unfavorable discharge
from military service, sexual orientation or order of protection status; and
WHEREAS, housing discrimination and barriers to equal housing opportunity are corrosive and undermine
a common sense of decency and fairness; and
WHEREAS, economic stability, community health and human relations in all communities are advanced
by diversity and integration; and

worked tirelessly to promote just and nondiscriminatory practices; and

social justice in north suburban Chicago. Their mission is to educate, advocate and organize to promote just
and inclusive communities in north suburban Chicago. Open Communities will host a celebration of the

URGING THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY TO PASS LEGISLATION TO REFORM
PERCENTAGE BASED BAIL BOND FEES
WHEREAS, in 2011, 79% of Cook County defendants were either ordered to pay financial bond to secure
release pending trial or held without bond, 13% were ordered released subject to electronic monitoring and
only 8% were released pursuant to an I-bond; which allows defendants to be released upon a signature, but
still subjects them to payment of the full bond amount if they fail to make a required court appearance; and
WHEREAS, by contrast, New York City releases approximately 70% of their felony pre-trial defendants
on personal recognizance, and Washington, D.C. releases over 80% of their felony pre-trial defendants on
personal recognizance, yet both cities have high court appearance rates and low re-arrest rates; and
WHEREAS, our over-reliance on a money-based bail system disproportionately impacts low-income
people and minorities, perpetuating the cycle of poverty and incarceration, evidenced by the fact that about
86% of the Cook County jail population are African-American or Hispanic; and
WHEREAS, when properly administered, bail is designed to be a function of risk to society or flight
risk,not simply a means test of ability to pay; and
WHEREAS, the overreliance on monetary bail and the inability of many detainees to afford it are among
the primary drivers of the level and growth in our jail population; and
WHEREAS, monetary bail additionally means that those too poor to pay remain in jail regardless of their
risk level or presumed innocence; and
WHEREAS, a decades-old state law (725 ILCS 5/110-7) directs court clerks to retain 10% of posted bail
as ‘bail bond costs’ regardless of the size of the bond even though the costs of processing a bond by the
Clerk of the Court are the same regardless of the bond amount; and
WHEREAS, people with limited financial resources may not have the capacity to forfeit a 10% deposit on
their bond and the prospect of posting bond is made even more challenging given that even if they are able
to post bond, 10% of the money posted is kept by the Clerk of the Circuit Court, regardless of whether they
abide by the conditions of their bond, if they are found to be innocent of the charges against them or even
if the charges are dropped; and

Page 21 of 170

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

WHEREAS, this percentage-based fee is inherently unfair and regressive. As a percentage of their income,
poor people who are arrested are paying more for these bond processing fees, in fact on any given day,
about 1/5 of the Cook County jail population are there because they were unable to post $6,000 or less to
bail out, resulting in higher than necessary daily jail populations at a significant cost to the county, costs
that can exceed the amount of the underlying bail; and
WHEREAS, in 2013, the Clerk of the Court for Cook County retained $5.6 million as ‘bail bond costs’
pursuant to 725 ILCS 5/110-7; and
WHEREAS, it is contrary to prudent public policy or the notion of an equitable criminal justice system for
units of government to use excessive ‘bail bond costs’ as a profit resource; and
WHEREAS, legislation was recently introduced in both the Illinois House of Representatives and Illinois
Senate which would amend 725 ILCS 5/110-7 by capping the antiquated percentage-based bond processing
fee collected by the Cook County Clerk of the Circuit Court at $100, an amount more than sufficient to
cover processing costs;
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners urges the
Illinois General Assembly to pass legislation amending 725 ILCS 5/110-7 to cap the fee collected on bail
bond deposits by the Clerk of the Circuit Court for Cook County, thereby reducing the already significant
and unnecessary financial burden on pre-trial detainees and their families, reducing average daily jail
population, as a necessary step towards reforming our criminal justice system; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a suitable copy of the Resolution be tendered to the Speaker of the
Illinois House of Representatives, the President of the Illinois Senate and to the Governor of Illinois.
Approved and adopted this 1st of April 2015.

OPPOSING A PROPERTY TAX INCREASE IN THE FISCAL YEAR 2016 BUDGET
WHEREAS, Cook County is located in the northeastern section of the State of Illinois that contains
more than 800 local governmental units within its boundaries, it has a population of approximately 5.3
million people, it is the second most populous county in the nation and the 19th largest government in the
United States (2005 census statistics); and
WHEREAS, Cook County contains 135 municipalities in its region, the most well-known being The
City of Chicago, the City of Chicago and the suburban municipalities account for approximately 85% of
the County’s 946 square miles, while unincorporated areas make up the remaining 15%; and
WHEREAS, property taxes are paid in arrears and are due in two installments every year, and after
taking advantage of property tax exemptions, many longtime homeowners still face the threat of being
forced to sell their property due to the exponential cost of their property taxes; and
WHEREAS, despite Cook County holding the line on its property tax levy since 1994, taxpayers are
subject to increasing property tax bills as a result of the increase of tax rates by individual taxing
districts; and
WHEREAS, property taxes collected by all governments in Cook County increased from $7.89 billion
in 2000 to $11.69 billion in 2010 according to the Heartland Institute; and
WHEREAS, according to Internal Revenue Service data from 1992 through 2010 Cook County lost a
net of nearly 276,000 taxpayers to neighboring counties, including DuPage, Will, Lake Kane, McHenry
and Lake County Indiana, raising property taxes will result in even more individuals and businesses
relocating to these neighboring counties; and
WHEREAS, our housing market is slowly recovering from the recession, but still lagging behind other
regions according to Zillow Inc., there are still lingering effects from foreclosures during the recession;
high property taxes can have a further negative effect on the housing market; and
WHEREAS, economies and governments can thrive from a broad tax base and lower taxes, raising
property taxes is a threat to an improving economy as it would restrict growth that has not been seen in
years; and
WHEREAS, while many families have not fully recovered from what is now referred to as the “Great
Recession” and there are still many people facing financial struggles, including senior citizens and
individuals on fixed incomes who cannot afford a property tax increase; and
WHEREAS, while Cook County has made many efforts to streamline County government, Cook County
residents still pay too much in taxes and fees; and
WHEREAS, businesses will continue to relocate to neighboring counties to avoid the high cost of doing
business in Cook County resulting in a loss of revenue and jobs; and
WHEREAS, while opposing a property tax increase, our opposition is not intended to extend to any
expiring TIF districts revenues and new construction revenues in Cook County.

Summary: The City of Oak Forest would like to express its interest in receiving a No Cash Bid for the
one (1) property/PIN below that houses an unoccupied commercial building on the property that has been
vacant for over 4 years. The City of Oak Forest has been working on various economic development
plans for the region where this parcel exists. By regaining economic development control of the area, the
City can begin to move these plans along to fruition. The primary land use for this property will be

commercial. Due to the lack of a third party requestor the City cannot provide a specific use or function,
but through the use of the City’s Comprehensive Land Use Plan and economic development planning the
city looks to reposition the property in the following manner: the City is working diligently to redevelop
and reinvigorate the Cicero Ave. corridor by investing in its streetscape and attain development control
on dilapidated multi-family/commercial buildings. One major issue along the commercial corridors of
Oak Forest is the smaller parcel commercial properties and lack of space for larger, more tax-producing
users. Oak Forest would like to retain control of this property as step1of the land consolidation with the
neighboring lots to create a larger more buildable lot in the future.
The City of Oak Forest will utilize its legal counsel to obtain the tax deed and bear all legal and other
costs associated with the acquisition of the parcel. If the City is awarded the subject property, the City
will provide an annual status report on the development of the property for five years or until
development is complete or conveyed for future development, whichever occurs last. The City of Oak
Forest will file for tax-exempt status for the subject properties for as long as the City is in ownership of
these properties.

the city plans to reposition the properties in the following manner:
The City of Oak Forest is the current and owner of 28-16-208-014-0000. The City seeks these properties
(28-16-208-015-0000, 28-16-208-016-0000) in order to consolidate all three parcels and create a new
commercial outlot on Cicero Avenue which will produce new tax increment in the City’s TIF district.

vehicle circulation pattern for nearby commercial entities that will result in better parking ratios, lot
circulation, and an increase in safer movements on and off Cicero Ave. The City projects this property
(28-27-203-003-0000) to be preserved as open space and possibly used as common detention area for the
future non-residential development of SE 167th Street & Cicero dependent on qualifying detention
standards. The City projects this property (28-27-203-012-0000) to be part of the land assembly required
to create a large scale development at SE 167th & Cicero Ave, as proposed by the Comprehensive land Use
Plan. The City seeks development control to ensure this property will be available as part of a future land
assembly.The City of Oak Forest will utilize its legal counsel to obtain the tax deeds and bear all legal and

The SunShot initiative is intended to enable replicable multi-year strategies that spur significant solar
deployment, drive down solar soft costs, support local economic development efforts, and address the
potential challenges arising from increased solar penetration on the electrical grid.
Project Tasks:
1. Opportunity Assessment: Inventory the current community solar market in the county, and
identify the potential market by suitable available sites (supply) and customer base (demand).
This will inform selection of pilot projects and identification of stakeholders.
2. Stakeholder Outreach and Engagement: Facilitate stakeholder collaboration to identify,
discuss, and resolve community-shared solar challenges in Northeast Illinois.
3. Research Policy Issues and Market Barriers: Address the policy and market barriers that
impose challenges to shared solar success.
4. Design Pilot Demonstration Programs: Choose 5 - 7 pilot project sites based on what is
learned from tasks 1 - 3. Analyze the physical and economic potential of those pilots.
5. Benefits and Next Steps: Document and disseminate the pilot site analysis of costs and benefits
to local, state and regional stakeholders.

Development (HUD) grant of Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR)
funds in response to disasters occurring in 2013, authorized under the Disaster Relief Appropriations
Act, 2013. The purpose of the CDBG-DR program is to assist targeted areas that have been affected by a
natural disaster (in this case, severe storms and flooding during the period of 4/16/2013 to 5/5/2013). The
program will provide necessary expenses related to disaster relief, long-term recovery, restoration of
infrastructure and housing, and economic revitalization in the most impacted and distressed areas
resulting from a major disaster declared pursuant to the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and
Emergency Assistance Act of 1974 (Stafford Act).
Cook County was initially allocated $68.8 million via two awards, which were accepted by the Cook
County Board of Commissioners in March and September 2014 respectively. Subsequent to the initial
allocation, Cook County was awarded an additional $14,816,000, bringing the total grant amount to
$83,616,000.
In order to identify the most impacted and distressed areas by the 2013 declared disaster as well as to
identify potential projects, the Department of Planning and Development met with or consulted related
studies prepared by the Cook County Departments of Homeland Security and Emergency Management,
Environmental Control, and Transportation and Highways, the Cook County Forest Preserve District, the
Illinois and Federal Emergency Management Agencies (IEMA and FEMA, respectively), the
Metropolitan Water Reclamation District, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as well as municipal and
township leaders.
The Department of Planning and Development desires to fund projects that strategically assist with the
recovery efforts and support other investments which are occurring in the area. Cook County plans to
enter into CDBG-DR agreements with municipalities, townships, for-profit and/or non-profit entities to
implement CDBG-DR activities.
I respectfully request approval to accept this grant award and that the Bureau Chief of the Bureau of
Economic Development or their designee, is authorized to execute on behalf of the County of Cook, any
and all documents necessary to facilitate administration of the program approved here in, including but
not limited to the CDBG-DR grant agreement, subrecipient agreements or other appropriate agreements,
and any modifications thereto. The approval of this of the request by this Honorable Body will permit the
CDBG-DR program to proceed with implementation.

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

Contract Number(s): 11-88-061
Concurrences:
The vendor has met the Minority and Women Owned Business Enterprise Ordinance.
The Chief Procurement Officer concurs.
Summary: Cook County has two 8-year-old IBM iSeries computers (one for production and one for
testing) that support mission-critical financial, property, and criminal justice systems, and over 2,000
internal users. While many of these systems are being reengineered for other platforms (such as the ERP
software that will replace the County’s current JD Edwards One World system), the County anticipates
needing iSeries capabilities for another 3 to 5 years. However, the County faces mounting risks in the
next 3 to 5 years as the physical hardware and software become increasingly unsupportable.
Therefore, BOT, BOF and the Assessor respectfully request approval of this amendment to the County’s
current Acxiom contract, which will include hosting of the County’s iSeries servers at Acxiom, where
the County’s mainframe is currently hosted. The increase and extension will fund the iSeries hosting
through 2019, without adding time or money for mainframe hosting services. The migration will
immediately upgrade the resiliency and availability of the County’s mission-critical financial, property,
and criminal justice systems that run on the iSeries servers, including the County’s JD Edwards One
World financial system.
Through this amendment, BOT and its partners seek to mitigate several identified risks to these systems:
eight-year-old hardware, including disk drives and tape drives, are increasingly failing due to their age;
and the servers’ back-up tape drives are out of support and are no longer supported by the manufacturer,
making restoration from tape drive extremely difficult. Were an out-of-support disk and tape drive to fail,
the County could face catastrophic data loss. Through the contract amendment, Acxiom will provide a
hosting environment that eliminates or reduces these potential points of failure.
In establishing its strategy and negotiating the contract amendment, BOT has coordinated with and
briefed several key stakeholders, including the County’s Chief Information Security Officer, Assessor’s
and Chief Judge’s offices; and service levels have been negotiated in order to meet the needs of our
finance, criminal justice and property stakeholders.

County as a home rule unit of government under the Constitution of the State of Illinois; and
WHEREAS, the President and Board of Commissioners of Cook County further intend to expressly
prohibit the use of carotid control holds by the John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital Police with the exception of
conditions expressly enumerated in Section 46-6(c) of this Ordinance.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, BY THE PRESIDENT AND BOARD OF
COMMISSIONERS OF COOK COUNTY:
Section 1. The above recitals are expressly incorporated herein and made part hereof as though fully set
forth herein.
Section 2. Chapter 46 of the Cook County Code of Ordinances concerning “Law Enforcement” is hereby
amended by adding a new Section 46-6 as follows:
Sec. 46-6 Policy on Use of Force - choke holds prohibited
(a) The John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital Police shall use an amount of force reasonably necessary based
on the totality of the circumstances to perform a lawful task, effect an arrest, overcome resistance, control
a subject or protect themselves or others from injury. Circumstances that may govern the reasonableness
of using a particular force option include but are not limited to: (1) whether the officer reasonably
believes the subject poses an immediate threat to the safety of officers or others; and (2) whether the
subject is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight.
(b) After gaining total control of a subject the John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital Police shall:
(1) Avoid sitting, kneeling or standing on a subject’s chest which may result in chest compression,
thereby reducing the subject’s ability to breathe;
(2) If practicable, position the subject in a manner to allow free breathing;
(3) Monitor an arrestee until transported to a secure location; and
(4) Seek medical attention for an arrestee who has injuries or illnesses consistent with applicable
standing orders and departmental policy directives.
(c) No employee of the John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital Police shall apply a carotid control hold in the
performance of his or her duties unless faced with a situation in which the use of deadly force is justified

under applicable law. A carotid control hold shall include but is not limited to, any sustained pressure to
the throat or windpipe which may prevent or hinder breathing or reduce intake of air.
(d) For purposes of this Section the following terms shall have the following meaning:
“Employee of the John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital Police” refers to any individual employed by the
aforementioned department who by virtue of that employment is vested by law with a duty to
maintain public order or make arrests for offenses, whether that duty extends to all offenses or is
limited to specific offenses.
Section 3. (a) Nothing in this Ordinance shall preclude an employee of the Office of the Cook County
Sheriff, the Sheriff’s Police Department, the Department of Corrections, the Court Services Department,
the John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital Police or the Investigators of the Cook County State’s Attorney from
utilizing self-defense tactics which are enumerated in the Illinois Law Enforcement Training and Standards
Board prescribed certification for Law Enforcement.
(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, an employee of the John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital Police
need not retreat or desist from efforts to make a lawful arrest because of resistance or threatened resistance
to the arrest. Any such officer or employee is justified in the use of any force which he reasonably believes
to be necessary to defend himself or another from bodily harm while making the arrest. However, the
officer or employee is justified in using force likely to cause death or great bodily harm only when he
reasonably believes that such force is necessary to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself or such
other person or when he reasonably believes both that:
(1) Such force is necessary to prevent the arrest from being defeated b resistance or escape; and
(2) The person to be arrested has committed or attempted a forcible felony which involves the infliction
or threatened infliction of great bodily harm or is attempting to escape by use of a deadly weapon,
or otherwise indicates that he will endanger human life or inflict great bodily harm unless arrested
without delay.
Section 4. Incorporating all of the foregoing provisions, this Ordinance shall be in full force and effect
upon its passage and publication.
Approved and adopted this 1st of April 2015.

RESOLUTION
URGING CONGRESS TO PASS THE BIPARTISAN CAMPUS ACCOUNTABILITY & SAFTEY
ACT TO ENCOURAGE MORE TRANSPARENT AND EFFICIENT PREVENTION,
REPORTING AND RESPONSE POLICIES FOR SEXUAL ASSAULT ON COLLEGE
CAMPUSES
WHEREAS, according to the U.S. Department of Education, college campuses reported over 5,000
forcible sex offenses in 2013 - but a recent study by the Bureau of Justice shows that the actual number of
offenses is estimated to be closer to 30,000 each year; and
WHEREAS, According to the Department of Justice, less than 5% of rape victims attending college report
their attack to law enforcement; and
WHEREAS, Despite evidence of the problem, 41 percent of colleges and universities recently surveyed
have not conducted a single investigation of sexual violence on their campus in the last five years; and
WHEREAS, Currently, 101 universities are under federal investigation by the U.S. Department of
Education’s Office for Civil Rights for alleged violations of Title IX related to the handling of sexual
violence; and
WHEREAS, Title IX states that “colleges and universities have a legal obligation to provide an
environment that is free from discrimination on the basis of sex in all education programs and activities.”
Sexual harassment, which includes sexual violence, is a form of sexual discrimination prohibited under
Title IX; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners recognizes the importance of addressing sexual
violence and the need to take all possible steps to prevent sexual assaults from occurring while
simultaneously creating safe, secure and streamlined reporting policies for the victims of sexual assault.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, the Cook County Board of Commissioners urges Congress
to pass the bipartisan Campus Accountability and Safety Act that establishes new campus resources and
support services for student survivors, requires fairness in campus disciplinary process, ensures minimum
training standards for on-campus personnel, creates new transparency requirements, requires better
accountability and coordination with local law enforcement and has enforceable Title IX penalties and
stiffer penalties for Cleary Act Violations.
Approved and adopted this 1st of April 2015.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
RESOLUTION OPPOSING THE CREATION OF LOCAL RIGHT TO WORK ZONES IN
ILLINOIS
WHEREAS, Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner has repeatedly called for the creation of local right to work
zones, in which voters could decide if workers in their communities employed in unionized industries can
opt out of paying dues to labor organizations; and
WHEREAS, Governor Rauner has asked for city councils across Illinois to consider a resolution asking
for voter referendums to allow local right to work zones, as well as changes to prevailing wage laws and
worker compensation laws; and
WHEREAS, such action has the potential to further dismantle unionized labor organizations, which have
historically protected the rights of working and middle-class Illinoisans and could lead to lower wages,
reduced benefits, and poor working conditions for employees whether they are union or non-union; and
WHEREAS, Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan released an opinion last week unequivocally
declaring that the concept of local right to work zones presented by Governor Rauner would violate the
National Labor Relations Act (NLRA); and
WHEREAS, the Attorney General opinion additionally states that “counties and municipalities, whether
home rule or non-home-rule, as well as all other political subdivisions, units of local government, and
school districts of this State, are precluded by federal law from enacting ordinances and resolutions that
limit or restrict the use of union security agreements. Further, current law does not authorize the creation,
through the passage of a referendum, of “right to work” zones or local areas wherein union security
agreements will not be recognized.”; and
WHEREAS, although Illinois courts have not had to address this matter previously, courts of other
jurisdictions and other state Attorneys General that have opined on the matter have uniformly concluded
that the NLRA preempts the prohibition of union security agreements by units of local government in all
instances relating to interstate commerce and that the lone exception to federal preemption authorizes only
states and territories, and not their political subdivisions, to prohibit union security agreements; and
WHEREAS, this latest attack on collective bargaining is an attempt to weaken organized labor and will
not make Illinois a more competitive business environment, evidenced by the fact that similar laws in other
states have had no significant impact on attracting employers to a particular state;

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners hereby
opposes the proposal to create local right to work zones in Illinois as such action would violate current
federal and state laws and would negatively impact collective bargaining and hurt hard-working
middle-class employees and their families in Illinois; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that in light of the current federal and Illinois laws, the Cook County
Board of Commissioners urges local government subdivisions within Cook County to refrain from
considering and adopting resolutions asking the Illinois Legislature to allow local right to work zones.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
URGING THE ILLINOIS GENERAL ASSEMBLY TO PASS LEGISLATION AMENDING THE
STATE CANNABIS CONTROL ACT AS PER HOUSE BILL 0218
WHEREAS, the State of Illinois has 103 municipalities with widely differing cannabis enforcement
standards in addition to State statutes, of which 46 are within Cook County, creating an inconsistent and
unfair legal patchwork; and
WHEREAS, the lack of a uniform standard gives officers the discretion to arrest under the state statute or
ticket under municipal codes, allowing for non-uniform enforcement of cannabis standards with no
statutory or basis in qualifying factors; and
WHEREAS, under the current law, Chicago and Cook County spend enormous resources enforcing
low-level drug offense where in the City of Chicago approximately 7,000 people are arrested every year
for possession of a controlled substance (PCS) of one gram of less and where low-level narcotics arrests
resulted in nearly 275,000 hours of work for Chicago police officers, keeping cops off the beat to fight
violent crime; and
WHEREAS, there have been one million arrests for misdemeanor marijuana possession in the State of
Illinois from 1975 to 2009 and Illinois ranked sixth in the nation in per-capita marijuana arrest rates in
2007, representing fifty-eight percent of all drugs arrest in the state; and
WHEREAS, Illinois had 12,406 more marijuana arrests in 2010 than it did in 2001; and
WHEREAS, Cook County led the nation in marijuana possession arrests in 2010 with 33,000 or 91 per
day; and

Page 166 of 170

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

April 1, 2015

WHEREAS, a 2013 American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) national study indicated that it costs up to
$250 million each year in Illinois to enforce our outmoded marijuana laws; and
WHEREAS, the lack of uniformity has led to Cook County having the highest racial disparity in cannabis
possession arrests among the 25 most populated counties nationwide, with African-Americans 7.56 times
more likely to face arrest statewide than Caucasians according to the American Civil Liberties Union; and
WHEREAS, most arrests for marijuana possession do not lead to trials or prison terms. Instead, a large
number of these arrests are plea-bargained, continued without a finding, dismissed, or otherwise handled
in a manner that makes ineffective use of limited criminal justice system resources; and
WHEREAS, arresting people for cannabis possession creates barriers to access to employment, school,
housing and immigration status, even if as is almost always the case, the charges are dismissed; and
WHEREAS, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Illinois believes House Bill 0218 prevents
the wrongful criminal classification of thousands of Illinois residents, which cost taxpayers millions of
dollars; and
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners does hereby
urge the Illinois General Assembly to amend the State Cannabis Control Act as per House Bill 0218; and
BE IT FURTHUR RESOLVED, that suitable copies of this resolution be delivered to the Speaker of the
Illinois House of Representatives and the President of the Illinois Senate.
