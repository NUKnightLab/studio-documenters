 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 15, 2005

The Alliance is a not-for-profit corporation comprised of the City of Chicago, Chicago Park District,
Chicago School Reform Board of Trustees, the Chicago Transit Authority, and the City Colleges of
Chicago. The purpose of the corporation is to seek access to competitive electric power markets that will
conserve public funds. Membership in this group will immediately allow Cook County to be eligible to
receive electric service under ComEd's Rider GCB and provide future professional resources for the
County's participation in the deregulated electric market.
The Alliance Agreement and Rider GCB allow governmental customers to work cooperatively in the
purchase of electric energy to aggregate their monthly kilowatt-hour energy usage and monthly kilowatt
demand. Under Rider GCB demand charges are more than fifty percent less than standard bundled rates.
Estimated annual countywide savings are $1.3 million. The membership fee for joining the Alliance will
be $70,000.00. Cook County is also required to proportionally share in the future costs of the Alliance.
The membership fee covers the County 's portion of the Alliance's initial start up costs and allows the
County equal voting rights in the Alliance. Annual shared costs will cover expenditures of the Alliance to
engage various professional support services for the Alliance.
Upon approval to join the Local Government Electric Power Alliance and sign Rider GCB, respectfully
request that the Chief Administrator Officer of the County of Cook, or his designee, be authorized to
execute, on behalf of the County of Cook, all documents necessary to join the Alliance and implement
Rider GCB rate savings.

"Department") to perform its essential function of protecting the public's health by preventing the spread
of potentially dangerous communicable diseases.
To protect the public' s health, it may be necessary for the Department to issue an order which results in a
deprivation of the liberty of one or more individuals. The Department recognizes that sacrifice is
involved in complying with such orders, both by individuals and the larger community, and endeavors to
impose the least restrictive measures it determines are required under the applicable circumstances.
The following regulations are issued pursuant to the Cook County Board of Health Ordinance, as
amended on March 9, 2004, and apply within those areas of Cook County which fall within the
jurisdiction of the Cook County Department of Public Health. These regulations impose obligations upon

whenever it determines that immediate action is required to protect the public's health, the CCDPH may
issue a Department Order imposing those measures it deems necessary to evaluate the existence of a
potential threat to the public's health or to protect the public 's health. Such Department Orders shall be
signed by the Department's Chief Executive Officer, or designee, and shall be based upon the
determination of the CCDPH that a less restrictive and equally efficacious measure is not reasonably
available.
Communication of Department Orders Directed to Individuals. Department Orders shall be
B.
served upon the individual who is the subject of the order through personal delivery to the individual or, if
necessary due to the infectious nature of a communicab le disease with which an individual is or may be

a copy shall also be delivered to any Provider who is rendering health care to such individual. In the
event of a Department Order for the closure of premi ses, notice of the Order shall be conspicuously
posted on or near points of ingress to the premises. In an emergency, orders may be communicated

reasonably calculated to provide notice of the order to the subjects of the order.
Consent to CCDPH Orders. When possible, the CCDPH will request that each person who is
C.
the subject of a CCDPH Order consent to the measures described in the order. A consent agreement shall

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 15, 2005

D.
Withdrawal of Consent to CCDPH Order. In the event an individual agrees to consent to a
CCDPH Order and later wishes to withdraw such consent, he or she must notify the CCDPH or his or her
desire to withdraw consent. The CCDPH shall, as soon as reasonably possible thereafter, notify the
individual that its Order is terminated or notify the individual that it has filed a petition in the Circuit
Court of Cook County to obtain a court determination of the matter. Until receiving notification of
termination of the CCDPH Order or until the detennination of the Court, whichever is applicable, the
CCDPH Order shall remain in full force and effect. For purposes of this paragraph, "as soon as

holidays.
E.
Right to Communications, Counsel and to Present Medical Evidence. The CCDPH Order
shall contain a statement of rights including a statement of the right to consult and be represented by an
attorney and the right to present medical evidence supporting an objection to the CCDPH Order. It
further shall inform the subject of the order that he or she may telephone an attorney, family member or
other persons( s ).
F.
Determinations Regarding Less Restrictive and Equally Efficacious Alternatives. In issuing
Department Orders, the CCDPH shall consider whether a less restrictive and equally efficacious measure
is available, utilizing the expertise of persons with training and education in the protection of public
health including, but not limited to, CCDPH personnel, IDPH personnel, and the expertise reflected in the
directives set forth in the CCD Code, the guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or
the World Health Organization.

VI.

Types of CCDPH Orders.

The CCDPH may issue one or more orders directing individuals to comply with measures deemed
necessary to evaluate the existence of a potential threat to the public's health or to protect the public's
health. Such orders may include, but shall not be limited to, orders restricting the activities of Cases or
Carriers (isolation orders); orders restricting the activities of Contacts (quarantine orders), orders
compelling the closure of premises (closure orders), and orders compelling an individual to undergo a
medical examination and/or observation and monitoring. Nothing in this Section shall limit a First
Responder or Provider from initiating a Temporary Emergency Detention when the clinical and other
factual circumstances dictate that such a measure is required to protect the public's health and when the
provisions of these Regulations are followed.

A.
Isolation Orders. A CCDPH isolation order shall set forth the specific location where a Case is
ordered to remain, if applicable, and shall describe any restrictions or limitations upon the activities of the
Case. The isolation order shall describe the period during which it shall remain in effect, which shall
typically be the period the dangerous communicable disease is believed to be infectious. A CCDPH
isolation order sha ll also set forth the clinical and/or circumstantial facts supporting the need for the
isolation order, any required monitoring, observation or medical examinations and the circumstances
which if satisfied may lead the modification or termination of the order.
B.
Quarantine Orders. A CCDPH quarantine order shall set forth the specific location(s), if
applicable, where the subject of the order is order to remain, any restrictions on the activities of the
subject of the order and a description of the period during which the person must comply with these
restrictions which shall typically be the period for which the dangerous communicable disease is believed
to be infectious under the applicable clinical circumstances. A CCDPH quarantine order shall also set
forth the clinical and/or circumstantial facts supporting the need for the quarantine order, any required
monitoring, observation or medical examinations which are required under the applicable clinical
circumstances and the circumstances which if satisfied may lead the modification or termination of the
order.

959

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH I 5, 2005

C.
Medical Examination Orders. The CCDPH may issue an order compelling an individual to
submit to a medical examination and compelling the licensed health professional who performs the
examination to provide the results thereof to the CCDPH when necessary to determine the medical status
of a person who has or may have been exposed to a dangerous communicable disease. Circumstances in
which this determination may be necessary include, but are not limited to, circumstances in which the
person has traveled in an area epidemic with a dangerous communicable disease and/or circumstances in
which the person has symptoms indicating the presence of a dangerous communicable disease. Refusal
to submit to a medical examination ordered by the Department may be grounds for the issuance of a
Department Order requiring the quarantine or isolation of the individual in order to protect the public's
health.
D.
Observation and Monitoring Orders.
The CCDPH may issue an order compelling an
individual to submit to observation and monitoring and compelling the Health Care Worker or First
Responder who performs the observation and monitoring to provide the results thereof to the CCDPH
when necessary to determine the medical status of a person who has been or may have been exposed to a
dangerous communicable disease. Circumstances in which this determination may occur include, but are
not limited to, circumstances in which the subject of the order may have been exposed to a dangerous
communicable disease, until such time as the risk of contracting the disease is over or other measures
become necessary. Refusal to submit to isolation and monitoring ordered by the Department may be
grounds for the issuance of an order requiring the quarantine or isolation of the individual in order to
protect the public's health .
E.
Closure Orders. In the event the CCDPH determines that an actual or potential danger to the
public 's health exists requiring the closure of a place until such time as the condition can be corrected or
the danger to the public health eliminated or reduced in such a manner that no immediate threat to the
public health any longer exists, the CCDPH may order a place closed and made off limits to the public.
A CCDPH closure order shall set forth the specific premises or location to be made off limits to the
public, the circumstances under which an individual may enter the premises, any other restrictions
imposed upon entry to or use of the premises, and the conditions which must be met before the closure
order is terminated. A CCDPH closure order shall also set forth the facts supporting the need for the
closure order and the circumstances which if satisfied may lead the modification or termination of the
order.
F.
Orders Applicable to Multiple Individuals. A Department Order may be directed to more than
one individual. If reasonably practicable, a Department order shall list the names and identifying
information of the persons who are the subjects of the Order. If complete information is not available, the
Department Order shall include the infonnation which is available and shall otherwise describe the
persons who are the subjects of the Order with as much specificity as is reasonably available.
VII.

Temporary Emergencv Detention by First Responders and Providers.

In situations in which a First Responder or Provider forms a reasonable belief, based on the totality of the
circumstances including, but not limited to, observation of symptoms, reliable information, and/or
knowledge of current public health threats, that immediate quarantine or isolation ("Temporary
Emergency Detention") of an individual or individuals is reasonably necessary to prevent a significant
risk to the public's health, then the First Responder or Provider may detain such individual or individuals
on a temporary emergency basis. The imposition of Temporary Emergency Detention is declared by the
Department to be necessary to protect the public' s health and shall be equivalent to a Department Order
and enforceable by all legal means.

960

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 15, 2005

1. Notification to Department of Temporary Emergency Detention. As soon as possible after
imposing Temporary Emergency Detention, the First Responder or Provider shall report the
Temporary Emergency Detention to the Department, which shall immediately investigate the
situation. The Department may order the Temporary Emergency Detention to continue pending
the outcome of its investigation... The Department's initial order may be verbal, but shall be
followed up with a written Department Order which in the absence of a declared disaster shall be
delivered or otherwise transmitted as soon as possible thereafter, within twenty-four (24) hours of
the commencement of the Temporary Emergency Detention.
2. Notification of Temporary Emergency Detention. As soon as reasonably practicable after
the imposition of a Temporary Emergency Detention, as described in this Section, the First
Responder or Provider shall inquire of the individual whether a spouse, family member, or friend
is to be notified of the Temporary Emergency Detention and shall assist the individual in
attempting to make such notifications.
3. Additional Provisions. Temporary Emergency Detention shall only be used as a public
health protection measure. In no event shall Temporary Emergency Detention be exercised by
any First Responder or Provider for any other purpose.
VIII.

Duration and Scope of Quarantine and Isolation.

The duration and scope of quarantine or isolation may vary, depending on the type of communicable
disease and the risks presented. For example, quarantine or isolation may be necessary in order to
provide:
A.
Quarantine or Isolation During Period of Risk Assessment. In some cases, persons believed
to be exposed to a dangerous communicable disease may be isolated or quarantined for a reasonable
period of time to permit assessment of risk including testing of specimens and for obtaining
epidemiological information including a history of symptoms, the source of potential exposures and
Contacts.
B.
Quarantine for Provision of Prophylactic Treatment. Where prophylactic treatment would
prevent illness or disease transmission, quarantine may last until such treatment has been provided.
C.
Quarantine for the Duration of the Incubation Period. Where a risk is reasonably believed to
be present, and treatment is either not indicated, not available or refused, then quarantine may be
necessary for the duration of the incubation period, which is the time period within which symptoms of
the disease are likely to appear. If, at the end of the incubation period, the individual is not considered to
be potentially contagious, he or she will be released from quarantine. If the individual is considered to be
potentially contagious, he or she may be ordered isolated for the duration of the infectious period.
D.
Isolation for the Duration of the Infectious Period. If an individual is considered to be
potentially infectious, he or she may be ordered isolated during the infectious period.
The order shall set forth the facts supporting the need for quarantine, the date and time quarantine
commenced, the expected duration, including the indicators (e.g., return of negative lab reports or
expiration of stated incubation period) that will result in termination of the quarantine, the location of the
quarantine (e.g., in the home or elsewhere), and any conditions on quarantine (e.g., limitations on visitors,
requirements of allowing CDPH or other medical monitoring), and shall be signed by a public health
physician.

In addition to the foregoing, the knowing infliction of harm or risk of harm upon others which may occur
when an individual refuses to comply with measures designed to prevent such harm through the
prevention of transmission of dangerous communicable disease may constitute a crime under applicable
law.
X.

Scope of These Regulations and Declared Disasters.

These Regulations are intended to assist First Responders and Providers to protect the public from
dangerous communicable diseases. The Department may implement additional health protection
measures and procedures prior to and during a declared disaster.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 15, 2005

269810

OFFICE OF CAPITAL PLANNING AND POLICY, by Michael E. LaMont, Director,
transmitting a Communication, dated January 26, 2005:
Transmitted herewith for your approval is a request for authorization for the Purchasing
Agent to advertise for bids for the 4th floor County Clerk's Office Renovation Project at the
Cook County Building. It is respectfully requested that this Honorable Body approve this
request.
Reason:

This project provides for the relocation of the Real Estate and Tax Services
Department to the north half of the 4th floor. The scope of work includes
renovation of the walls, floors, ceilings, lighting, asbestos abatement and the
upgrade of the mechanical systems. This work is necessary in order to provide
more space for the Clerk's operation and to provide easier public access. Also,
new telecommunications wiring will be installed to ensure that the Clerk's
automated systems, such as Geographic Information System (GIS) mapping and
a new cashiering/accounting system, can be supported.

Bond Issue (7000 Account).
Sufficient funds have been appropriated to cover this request.

*Referred to the Committee on Construction on 03/01/05.
Commissioner Collins asked if there is adequate space on the fourth floor to accommodate a conference
room for the Board of Commissioners.
Michael E. LaMont, Director, Office of Capital Planning and Policy, replied that there is adequate space.
Chairman Sims stated that the Commissioners need a library, and that this possibility should be
investigated .
Commissioner Silvestri asked if there has been any discussion of a conference room for the
Commissioners.
Mr. LaMont replied that there have been no discussions that he has been involved in obtaining additional
space for the Commissioners. Further, Mr. LaMont stated that several years ago there were such
discussions, but it was decided that the Administration Committee of the Board would look at options and
decide if there was something that should be done.
Commissioner Han sen asked how much square footage is being vacated on the fourth floor.
Mr. LaMont replied 15,000 square feet.
Commissioner Hansen asked for the square footage of the Vital Statistics Office located in the basement.
Mr. LaMont replied 12,000-13,000 square feet.
Commissioner Hansen suggested that the records that are stored in the Vital Statistics Office could be
relocated to the fourth floor.

1038

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 15, 2005

Chairman Sims stated that the space located on the fourth floor of the County Building is not conducive
to the space that is needed for the Vital Statistics Office.
Chairman Sims asked Brandon Neese, Deputy County Clerk, to address the Committee.
Brandon Neese, Deputy County Clerk, stated that there have been conversations with Mr. LaMont and
others regarding the possibility of relocating the Vital Statistics Office to the fourth floor, however, over
five hundred constituents visit the Vital Statistics Office each day. This large influx of the public may
over-burden and disrupt the traffic flow in the building or even slow down the elevators.
Commissioner Hansen asked Mr. Neese where he suggests that the Vital Statistics Office should be
relocated.
Mr. Neese replied that there is space available in the Pedway, Room CL25; the office can be better
accessed by the public and the public would not have to travel by elevator.
Commissioner Hansen stated that records should not be stored at a lower level location and asked Mr.
LaMont to look at other alternatives besides the lower level for the Vital Statistics Office and the storing
of their records.
Mr. Neese replied that the County Clerk's Office is concerned about the current location of the Vital
Statistics Office because there have been both an underground flood, leakage from the street, and other
environmental issues as well.
Commissioner Hansen asked if the County Clerk 's Office has made suggestions regarding space for the
Statistical operation.
Mr. Neese replied that the County Clerk's Office has not made any other suggestions, but that other
individuals have looked at the space and have stated that it would be a secure place for the Vital Statistics
Office.
Commissioner Hansen asked where the Clerk of the Circuit Court should be relocated.
Mr. LaMont replied that there are three different functions at that location: the MIS function would be
relocated to 69 West Washington on the twenty-fourth floor, and the reproduction and the mailroom
function would be relocated into the County Building, close to the loading dock in the Daley Center.
Commissioner Hansen asked if there is any available space on the first floor of the Cook County
Building.
Mr. LaMont replied in the negative.

Commissioner Hansen, seconded by Commissioner
Communication No. 269810. The motion carried.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 15, 2005

269811

OFFICE OF CAPITAL PLANNING AND POLICY, by Michael E. LaMont, Director,
transmitting a Communication, dated January 26, 2005:
Transmitted herewith for your approval is a request for authorization for the Purchasing
Agent to advertise for bids for the Provident Hospital Emergency Department
Renovation/Expansion and New Pharmacy Addition Project. It is respectfully requested that
thi s Honorable Body approve this request.
Reason:

This project provides for the renovation and the 3,340 square foot expansion of
non-clinical areas in the hospital's Emergency Department (ED) and for the
construction of a 6,500 square foot new outpatient pharmacy.
These
improvements in the reception, registration, triage and pharmacy waiting areas
are necessary to accommodate the increasing number of patrons and to ensure
privacy and confidentiality for the patients it serves. The design of these areas
will be in conformance with Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH)
requirements. In addition, the new pharmacy was designed to meet the
requirements of the US Green Building Counci l and the project will be submitted
for LEED certification.

Reimbursement from the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity in an
amount not to exceed $1,500,000.00 may be available to assist in the partial funding of this
project. Any disbursements received from this agency will be applied as a reimbursement
toward the bond issue established for this project.
Bond Issue (9000 Account).
Sufficient funds have been appropriated to cover this request.

*Referred to the Committee on Construction on 03/01/05.
Commissioner Silvestri asked if part of the amendment is the $1.5 million anticipated from the Illinois
Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity.
Mr. LaMont replied in the affirmative.
Commissioner Silvestri asked if the $1.5 million was an additional project cost, or whether this represents
a savings of $1.5 million because the State is allocating these funds to the County.
Mr. LaMont replied that the County is saving $ 1.5 million.
Commissioner Silvestri asked for the status of the funds.
Mr. LaMont replied the County will receive $750,000 over a two year period and has received the first
installment of $750,000.
Commissioner Silvestri asked if it is subject to legislative approval.
Mr. LaMont replied that he thinks it has already been approved.
Commissioner Silvestri asked whether the second installment has been put into the current budget or
whether it is in next years' budget.

1040

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 15, 2005
Mr. LaMont replied that he will forward the response to Commissioner Silvestri.
Commissioner Hansen asked if this project is included in the FY 2005 Budget.
Mr. LaMont replied that all of the fund s were appropriated in the FY 2004 Budget and that the funds are
available.
Commissioner Silvestri clarified Commissioner Han sen's remarks: If the County loses that funding it
would impact what the County can do in the Bureau of Health Services. Further, Commissioner Silvestri
asked about the future of the County's pharmacy services at the Bureau of Health Services.
Mr. LaMont stated that both of the projects that are included are not luxuries, but needs. He further stated
that the waiting room at Provident Hospital of Cook County is inadequate for the volume that it takes; the
pharmacy in the Sengstacke Clinic is also inadequate.
Commissioner Silvestri asked whether the new 6,500 square foot outpatient pharmacy is additional
existing pharmacy space or whether the pharmacy is being relocated.
Mr. LaMont replied that the pharmacy will be relocated.
Chairman Sims stated that the expansion needs to take place even if the County has farmed out its
pharmacy services.
Commissioner Silvestri asked the location of the stand-alone pharmacy compared to Provident Hospital
of Cook County.
Mr. LaMont replied that the stand-alone pharmacy is located at the corner of 50th and Vincennes; it is
vacant land that Cook County owns.
Commissioner Silvestri asked whether after the stand-alone pharmacy is built, will it be connected to
Provident Hospital of Cook County.
Mr. LaMont replied that it will not be connected to Provident Hospital of Cook County.
Mr. LaMont stated that what will be isolated out is the outpatient portion.
Commissioner Silvestri asked if the pharmacy is currently in one location .
Mr. LaMont notified the Commissioners that a representative from Provident Hospital of Cook County
was present to answer the Commissioners' questions.
Dennis Rice, Associative Administrator for Support Services, Provident Hospital of Cook County, replied
that the current layout for the outpatient pharmacy is in two areas, one area where the drugs are dispensed
to the patients and another area where the prescriptions are filled for the outpatient pharmacy. In the new
pharmacy everything will be in one area: the waiting room, the room for privacy for the patients picking
up their prescriptions, and the location where prescriptions will be filled adjacent to where the medication
is actually picked up.
Commissioner Silvestri asked how an inpatient would receive the medications that were prescribed.
Mr. Rice replied that the inpatient pharmacy would continue to be located in the Hospital.

1041

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 15, 2005

Mr. Rice further stated that because of the pharmaceutical act you have to keep outpatient and inpatient
medications separated because they fall under different laws.
Commissioner Silvestri asked if there is any available space in the Hospital for a new pharmacy.
Mr. Rice replied that Provident H ospital of Cook County researched that possibility for a year prior to the
recommendation from the Office of Capital Planning and Policy to build a stand-alone pharmacy.
Further, Mr. Rice stated that the Hospital has gone from 600 prescriptions per day to approximately 1,400
cu1Tently for outpatients.
Commissioner Silvestri asked whether the new pharmacy would require additional staffing.
Mr. Rice replied that there would be no increase in staff. The Pharmacy staff would remain the same for
the outpatient pharmacy; the security would be in the current contract.
Commissioner Collins asked why there is a separate building.
Mr. LaMont replied that there are two things with this project. First, a number of years ago when they
were looking at the need for a new pharmacy, and before a budget was formu lated for this project, the
Office of Capital Planning and Policy worked with Provident Hospital of Cook County to determine
whether there was room in the Sengstacke C linic for a state-of-the-art pharmacy. They discovered that
there wasn' t enough room in the ex isting building. Second, in terms of a stand-alone pharmacy, the
Bureau of Health Services has examined this for the future , not only at Provident Hospital of Cook
County but also at Stroger Hospital and Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County.

Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Gorman, moved to defer Communication No.
269811 as amended, subject to a report being issued by the Bureau of Health Services and the
Department of Facilities Management on the feasibility of an alternative location within existing
buildings.

Commi ssioner Hansen asked whether the deferral wou ld cause any problem with receiving the funds.
Mr. LaMont replied in the affirmative.
Commi ssioner Hansen asked Mr. LaMont to let the Committee know what the p roblem would be.
Mr. LaMont replied that he cannot tell the Committee the specifi c timelines, but there are ti melines to
spend the funding. He stated he would get back to the Committee with an exact timeline . He fu rther
stated that another course of action that the Commissioners could take would be to request bids
immediately, because it will take six to eight weeks to receive the bids back for approval and during that
time all of the Commissioners' questions could be answered.
Commissioner Silvestri asked why no representative from the Bureau of Health Services was present at
the meeting to explain to the Commissioners why the pharmacy cannot be put in Provident Hospital of
Cook County.
Commissioner Gorman asked if the $ 1.5 million could be applied to an alternative plan.
Mr. LaMont replied that he did not know the answer. He stated that two years ago when the project
began and consultants were hired, everything was in order with the project and it was able to move ahead.

1042

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 15, 2005

Commissioner Collins asked if the individuals who drew the plans for the pharmacy were present at the
meeting.
Mr. LaMont called on a representative from McDonough & Associates, Inc. to address the
Commissioners.
Commissioner Collins asked whether when the plans were drawn for the new pharmacy, was there an
assessment done of Provident Hospital of Cook County to determine whether there was any possibility
that the current pharmacy could be expanded, or whether the adjacent-area walls could be removed to
expand and make additional space for the pharmacy.
Gary Mundinger, L.A., Associate, with McDonough & Associates, Inc. replied that at the beginning of
the project, McDonough & Associates, Inc. walked through the area where the current pharmacy is
located, looked at the pharmacy operations, and looked at adjacent space; they discovered that there was
not 6,500 square feet in any given area available in Provident Hospital of Cook County. Mr. Mundinger
further stated that to have created the pharmacy within the existing space would not only have meant
renovating certain areas, but would also have meant relocating some groups into other areas and
renovating those areas for other clinics in order to create a contiguous 6,500 square feet of space.
Therefore, in McDonough's opinion this procedure would have been more expansive than building a new
pharmacy. In regards to expanding the building, there is not enough space available to expand the
building.
Commissioner Collins asked whether the pharmacy could be added to the current clinic.
Mr. Mundinger replied that the only available space that is adjacent to the clinic is at the entrance to the
clinic itself on the north side of the clinic, and that there is not 6,500 square feet of land available.
Commissioner Collins asked about the total cost of the pharmacy.
Mr. LaMont replied that the cost would be $3.1 million.
Commissioner Hansen suggested that the Commissioners need to go ahead and approve the item.

Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Gorman, withdrew the motion to defer
Communication No. 269811.
Commissioner Silvestri asked the Chairman whether the Commissioners could receive the answers from
the Bureau of Health Services prior to the next Board meeting.

Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Gorman, moved to amend Communication No.
269811. The motion carried.
Reimbursement from the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic
Opportunity in an amount not to exceed $1 ,500.000.00 may be available to assist in
the partial funding of this project. Any disbursements received from this agency will
be applied as a reimbursement toward the bond issue established for this project.

Commissioner Collins, seconded by Commissioner Hansen, moved the approval of Communication
No. 269811 as amended. The motion carried.

1044

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 15, 2005

Mr. LaMont replied that the City of Chicago passed a new high-rise ordinance in December 2004 that
requires all high-rise buildings to have sprinkler systems, with the exception of buildings that are
landmarked. Further, he stated that under the ordinance, high-rise buildings have a twelve-year period of
time in which they are allowed to comply, but, at a minimum, a third of the building must be completed in
the first four years, a third of the building must comply in the next four years, and the last part of the
building must be in compliance by the fourth year. Mr. LaMont stated that this project is proposed to
complete the whole installation in a three-year period. With respect to the specifics of how it's going to
be done, the management from the Daley Center can answer those questions for the Commissioners. In
conclusion, Mr. LaMont stated that at some point in the future he will have to come before the
Commissioners to talk about funding for sprinklers for other County buildings that will have to comply
with the ordinance.
Mr. LaMont stated that, at this time, the City of Chicago requires that by September 1, 2005, every
building owner must submit a plan to the City of Chicago as to how it will comply.
Commissioner Hansen asked in what sense the installation of the sprinklers is Cook County's
responsibility and not the City of Chicago's or the Public Building Commission's responsibility.
Mr. LaMont replied that it would represent the County's share of the total cost of the project.
Historically, the County has paid its share of capital projects.
Commissioner Hansen asked how much does the County pay.
Mr. LaMont replied about 87%, based on the occupancy.
Commissioner Hansen asked by what method the County has come to the conclusion that the $13 million
is the County's responsibility. He noted that the backup material shows the County ' s share is $4,479,390.
Mr. LaMont replied that the $13 million is a portion of the total project, which is $16 million. He stated
that the $13 million was also in the capital program budget which was approved by the Board. Further,
he stated that the $13 million is the total County 's share over a three-year period whereas the $4.4 million
is the estimated expenditure for FY 2005 only.
Commissioner Silvestri asked if the Public Building Commission is created by statute, and whether it
defines each of the member's responsibi lities in terms of cost.
Mr. LaMont replied that it is defined by percentage; paid by the City of Chicago, Cook County and the
Public Building Commission.
Commissioner Hansen stated that it would be helpful for the Commissioners to receive an opinion from
the State's Attorney's Office on the County's responsibility with respect to the cost on a major
expenditure such as the sprinkler system.
Chairman Sims asked what would happen if problems were to arise while installing the sprinklers, who
would be responsible for the additional money.
Mr. LaMont replied that the Daley Center would come back to the County and ask for additional funding .
Chairman Sims asked where the funding would come from.

1045

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 15, 2005

Commissioner Silvestri asked if there is a lease or an agreement that was signed by the County when the
Commission was created and if it is in the statute. He further inquired whether the agreement had to be
approved by the Board or it is approved by the Commission.
Commissioner Hansen asked whether action can be held on Communication No. 269813 until the next
meeting.
Mr. LaMont replied that there might not be another Construction Committee meeting until April. He
asked whether it would be acceptable if the State's Attorney's Office did the research prior to the March
15, 2005 Board Meeting.
Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Hansen, moved the approval of
Communication No. 269813 as amended, subject to an opinion and explanation by the State's
Attorney's Office regarding the financial obligations of the County with respect to this project and
other projects of the Public Building Commission (PBC). The motion carried.

Co-Sponsored by Earlean Collins, Carl R. Hansen, Joseph Mario Moreno, Anthony J.
Peraica, John P. Daley, Roberto Maldonado and Deborah Sims, Bobbie L. Steele, County
Commissioners.
The following is a synopsis to the Proposed Ordinance.
PROPOSED ORDINANCE

COUNTY JAIL COST REIMBURSEMENT ORDINANCE
WHEREAS, the County is responsible for funding the operations of the Cook County
Department of Corrections which operates Cook County Jail ("Jail"); and
WHEREAS, the expenses of persons who have been arrested and require medical treatment
while in custody of an arresting authority other than the Sheriff of Cook County ("Sheriff')
are the responsibility of the arresting authority until such time as the arrestee is placed in the
custody of the Sheriff, in his capacity as Warden of the Jail; and
WHEREAS, the County Jail Act, 730 ILCS 125/ 1 et seq., provides for the Warden of the Jail
to furnish necessary bedding, clothing, fuel and medical aid for all prisoners under his charge
(hereinafter "detainees"); and
WHEREAS, when medical or hospital services are required by an arrestee, the county,
private hospital, physician or any public agency which provides such services shall be
entitled to obtain reimbursement from the County or from a special fund known as the
Arrestee's Medical Costs Fund (" Fund"), to the extent that moneys in the Fund are available
for the cost of such services; and
WHEREAS, the County Jail Act provides that, to the extent a detainee is reasonably able to
pay for such care, including reimbursement from any insurance program or from other
medical benefit programs available to such persons, he or she shall reimburse the County or
arresting authority; and
WHEREAS, the County Jail Act further provides that the County shall be entitled to a $10
fee for each conviction or order of supervision for a criminal violation, other than a petty
offense or business offense, which fee shall be taxed as costs to be collected from the
defendant, if possible, upon conviction or entry of an order of supervision and which fee shall
not be considered a part of the fine for purposes of any reduction in the fine; and

1047

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 15, 2005

WHEREAS, the County Jail Act further provides that all such fees collected shall be
deposited by the County in a fund to be established and known as the Arrestee' s Medical
Costs Fund to be used solely for reimbursement of costs for medical expenses of the arrestee
incurred in the course of arrest, and for administration of the Fund; and
WHEREAS, the County seeks to maximize its ability to obtain reimbursement for medical
and hospital services provided to detainees.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT HEREBY ORDAINED:
I.

Arrestee's Medical Costs Fund

2.

County Health Services Costs

EFFECTIVE DATE:

This Ordinance shall take effect upon passage.

*Referred to the Department of Corrections Subcommittee on 01120/05.
Commissioner Suffredin moved to amend Section 2, "County Health Services Costs", ..Detainee
Obligation to Reimburse County" by replacing "inehulieg" with "as defined as", seconded by
C ommissioner Peraica. The motion carried.
Detainee Obligation to Reimburse County.
Detainees who are
reasonably able to pay for hospital or medical services provided or paid
for by the County, including as defined as payment through any
insurance program or other medical benefit programs available to such
detainee, shall be required to reimburse the County for the cost of such
services.
Commissioner Silvestri stated that the ordinance levies a $ 10 fee each time a person is convicted of a
criminal violation or is assigned an order of supervision, with the exception of petty offenses and business
offenses. The fee is allocated to a fund which offsets the expense of medical care for convicts. Each fee
is levied at the order of the judge; the judge can waive the fee in cases of financial hardship.
Commissioner Maldonado asked whether the ordinance applies to all County hospitals and to all private
hospitals.
Commissioner Silvestri responded in the affirmative.
Vice Chairmen Hansen asked why the levy is $10 and not another amount.
Commissioner Silvestri responded that $10 is the fee that the state statute mandates.
Commissioner Peraica voiced his concern that the fee seldom will be collected.
Vice Chairman Hansen voiced his concern that no cost-benefit analysis has been conducted to determine
the economic benefit of imposing this levy. He noted that the time required of the Clerk of the Circuit
Court' s Office and the Public Defenders' Office needs to be factored into any cost-benefit analysis.

1048

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 15, 2005

Commissioner Silvestri stated that the cost of collection would be minimal.
Commissioner Suffredin noted the Clerk of the Circuit Court's Office stated that when the Mental Health
Court was being administered, the cost for programming additional fees was negligible and that checks
were automatically generated.
Vice Chainnan Hansen noted that there is a cost associated to process the checks.
Commissioner Maldonado asked how many criminal convictions will fall under the purview of this
ordinance.
Commissioner Silvestri responded that up to 400,000 criminal convictions will fall under the purview of
this ordinance, although it is unclear how many fees will be collected. He further stated that if 40% of the
fees are collected, this would yield $1.6 million.
Vice Chairman Hansen asked how often judges would waive this fee.
Assistant State's Attorney Randolph Johnston responded that he did not know the answer to this question.
Commissioner Peraica stated that fifty-five fees currently exist that are levied on convicts, and that this
fee would be the fifty-sixth. He questioned how many of these fees are collectable. He voiced the
concern that the fees most likely would be collected from middle-class convicts, and would not apply to
either the upper or lower economic strata.
Vice Chairman Hansen asked who would collect the fees.
Chairman Steele stated that she would send a letter to the Clerk of the Circuit Court's Office to address
the questions raised by the Commissioners.
Commissioner Maldonado asked who determines whether a convict can "reasonably" pay the fee.
Commissioner Silvestri stated that this term refers to whether a convict possesses insurance or collects
public aid. He further stated that this levy shifts part of the burden of health care costs from the taxpayer
to the insurance companies and the Department of Public Aid.
Vice Chairman Hansen noted that the additional costs of the judges' time and the time required to obtain
insurance and public aid records should be considered in an economic analysis.
Leave was granted to add Chairman Steele and Vice Chairman Hansen as sponsors of the amended
proposed ordinance.

Commissioner Suffredin, seconded by Commissioner Maldonado, moved the approval of
Communication No. 269192 as amended. The motion carried.

1054

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDING S FOR MARCH 15, 2005

Commissioner Suffredin explained that there are professional tax buyers who have created a secondary
market selling their certificates before they have been executed and before a deed has been issued for the
property. The City believes that a taxing body should obtain some of the money. It would require the tax
purchaser to be present at the scavenger sale and rights would be sold to a third party before it has gone to
deed, and all the prior back taxes must be paid.
Commissioner Sims wanted clarification on HB 350.
Mr. Casey stated that House Bill 350 passed out of the House and is in the Senate. He further stated that
this is one of the main sex offender bills that seems to be progressing.
Commissioner Suffredin stated that HB 339 that increases juror fees will be significant.
Commissioner Suffredin introduced Patrick Hanlon, General Counsel for the Cook County Assessor's
Office, and requested that he provide a summary of bills that impact the County.
Mr. Hanlon stated that the Assessor's Office has 12 bills in Springfield that are initiatives that comprised
of 6 proposals. The first one is a bill that Mayor Richard Daley is interested in and that other mayors are
interested in also. Meetings with local business groups have discussed examining the yearly market
values and determining a factor that needs to be applied to a certain class of property. Currently this bill,
Senate Bill 1664 and House Bill 3466 are up in the Senate and House. There are procedural issues that
need to be addressed.
The second initiative is the single-market-value, which allows the Assessor to list and publish the total
assessed value without having to break out the land-assessed value and improvement-assessed value. The
bill has been amended to make it permissive statewide. The Assessor is working with the Board of
Review on this. This bill is to provide the taxpayers useful information when the Assessor publishes it.
This concerns a fair and open system. These two bills are House Bill 2502 and Senate Bill 1454.
The next bill pertains to open space in regards to certain types of properties taking advantage of the
vagueness in the definition of "open space." This will provide more clarity to the language of what
properties qualify for the language of "open space." This is a tool for the taxing districts and the
taxpayers. This is House Bill 3827 and Senate Bill 1761.
The fourth initiative is Full Information Request which would provide a request in writing to the Assessor
and additional information that is relevant and required by the agency to a fair determination of cash
property. This bill, House Bill 2563 and Senate Bill 1816 are only applicable to Cook County.
The fifth proposal calls upon the Property Tax Appeals Board when they review assessments that have
been complained to that Agency they are to review it in a clear and convincing standard as opposed to
weight of evidence. This provides that every one pays their fair share. This pertains to HB 1435 and
Senate Bill 356.
The last initiative, Tax Payer Information, provides that information given be on Real Estate Transfer
Declaration Jaw. This enables the buyer to be aware that when they are purchasing property, the taxes as
they are may not remain the same for the following year when they own their property, because of
homestead exemptions.

1055

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 15, 2005

Martha Mills, Senior Legal Counsel for the Treasurer's Office talked about two bills, Senate Bill 126 and
House Bill 505 that the Treasurer strongly opposed. Senate Bill 126 would cut School Districts out of
having to pay any interest on refunds. House Bill 505 provides that the collector and tax objection
procedures have to give notice to taxing bodies up to three times in a single proceeding.
Commissioner Suffredin noted that Nicole Saulsberry, Legislative Coordinator, and others provide a
weekly report for all County legislators about the issues of primary concern, so that other legislators and
their constituents understand the financial impact or the procedural impact on the citizens.
Commissioner Daley asked if any of the bills that the County opposed passed out of committee.
Mr. Casey stated that there are some that are out of committee and some are shell bills.
Commissioner Goslin asked if the County had liaisons that developed relationships with both parties in
Springfield and whether Cook County has representatives that can speak on its behalf.
Mr. Morrill stated that at the beginning of the session a list of people who serve as liaisons who have an
understanding of the issues is provided.
Commissioner Peraica asked if anyone knew about $9 million given to the County for parole violators in
the County 's system as detainees.
Mr. Casey said that he was not aware of this.
Commissioner Suffredin stated that $9 million is allocated to the Boot Camp and the Juvenile Temporary
Detention Center. Some money goes to the Probation Office.
Commissioner Peraica asked what is going to be done differently with the TB district to make sure the
item gets through.
Mr. Casey stated that he and Senator Harmon were going to work on some of the outdated language and
other issues dealing with pensions that were not addressed so that a bill could be worked out.
Commissioner Peraica stated that the goal should be to engineer it to provide for a rebate to the Suburban
Cook County taxpayers.
Commissioner Peraica moved to adjourn the meeting, seconded by Commissioner Gorman. The
motion carried and the meeting was adjourned.

*Referred to the Real Estate Subcommittee 03/01/05.
Commissioner Peraica stated that the original Ordinance that was signed by Cook County Board
President Richard Phelan in 1991 provided a charge of one-cent-per record in a data-set known as the
Redi Package which is prepared by the County Assessor, the County Clerk and the County Treasurer.

1058

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 15, 2005

The Redi Package is sold to a limited number of vendors who incorporate the data into their wider data
sets and is also sold to title companies and to persons interested in dealing with Cook County Real Estate
parcels of 1.5 million.

Commissioner Peraica moved to amend Section 9 to change the effective date back from March 1,
2005 to January 1, 2005. Seconded by Commissioner Maldonado, the motion carried.
This amendment and the charges established herein shall be effective on
and after January UaPeh January 1 March 15, 2005.
Chairman Steele stated the Real Estate Management Division has utilized the option of updating the
ordinance.
Commissioner Maldonado voiced his concerned about the original language being deleted and excluding
not-for-profit religious institutions from being exempt from the increased fee .
Anna Ashcraft, Special Assistant, Office of the President, stated the following: The Real Estate
Management Division wanted to have a fairly broad definition of the not-for-profit users. It is very
unlikely that a religious institution would have use for the Redi Package. The Redi Package would
typically be for educational institutions' use for informational-research purposes only. Not-for-profit
under Section 501 C3 and individuals can request this information. Also, if a party desired to use it
among a consortium of people, the Real Estate Management Division could draft an agreement so it could
be done appropriately and controlled.
Commissioner Peraica stated that, based on past revenue, the County would be expected to generate an
additional $500,000.

Commissioner Peraica, seconded by Commissioner Maldonado, moved the approval of
Communication No. 269814 as amended. The motion carried.
