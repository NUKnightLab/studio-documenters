Mr. David Kugler indicated that there is an order that the Board is going to issue with respect to Officer
Hendricks. However, for purposes of accuracy, he inquired with Officer Hendricks’ attorney, Mr. Ralph
Licari, if Officer Hendricks is still on suspension from the Chicago Police Department? Mr. Licari
indicated that she is on suspension and Dan Herbert, attorney, is representing her at a hearing about the
suspension. Mr. Ralph Licari confirmed that Officer Hendricks is thus in a no-pay status from the day of
the suspension to current.
"At this time the Board finds Hendricks’ application seeking ordinary disability benefits is not yet ripe for
the Board's consideration as Hendricks, No. 1, has not yet exhausted all available medical time off from
the Chicago Police Department for which she is entitled to full pay and benefits and, No. 2, has not
received certification of her injury or illness from the Chicago Police Department Medical Services
Section. Further, the Board finds Hendricks' matter is more properly before the Chicago Police
Department pursuant to a grievance as provided for in the employment agreement."
It was moved by Trustee Hamburger, seconded by Trustee Wright that the Board approve the order on
Cherie Hendricks as submitted.

The Executive Director reviewed with the Board the following matters.
•

Representatives of the Fund have been requested to attend the hearings for the Senate Special
Committee on State and Pension Fund Investments. Those hearings are scheduled for October
16th and 17th. The Senate Committee has requested that attending from each fund shall be the
Executive Director, the Chief Investment Officer, the CEO of the investment consultant to the
Fund and the President of the Board. Fund staff has learned that Mike Manning, the Managing
Partner of NEPC is only available on October 16th. The Executive Director has informed the
organizer of the Senate Hearings about Mr. Manning’s availability. Official schedule of the
hearings has not yet been provided.

•

A reminder that the election for the Lieutenant Trustee position will be held Friday – October 6,
2017. There are two candidates and there are 353 members that are eligible to vote. Once the
election is concluded, the Executive Director will inform each Board member of the election
results.

•

A request from the Fund’s CIO to attend the CIO Global Summit. The Executive Director
indicated that Ms. Devitt had requested funds in the 2017 budget for two educational courses that
she has attended this year, however, the cost was approximately $750 less than requested and
budgeted. She has thus requested that the unused budget allocation be used for the CIO Global
Summit.
It was moved by Trustee Wright, seconded by Trustee Beyna that the Board approve the CIO’s travel and
expense to attend the CIO Global Summit.

The next item discussed is the healthcare renewal for staff and retired staff of the Fund. Each
Board member was provided with a summary of the 2017 staff healthcare budget, expenses-to-date
and estimated 2017 total expenses. The healthcare plan for staff and retired staff of the Fund is a
November 30th year-end plan, which means a December 1st renewal. Renewal is typically
completed by October 15. The broker submitted the renewal numbers for the coverage provided.
The plan has had a favorable experience year. The Executive Director reminded the Board that one
year ago, the Board approved renewal of the plan, including all Fund employees and retired staff of
the Fund. The Executive Director proposed two plans and the related budgets, based upon the
renewal numbers.
Plan A would continue the current policy, which includes participation of the retired staff of the
Fund. Retirees of the Fund would be responsible for the full cost of any rate increases by the
provider, Blue Cross/Blue Shield. The subsidy of the Fund would continue, however, there would
be no increase in the subsidy.
Plan B would continue the current policy, however retired Medicare-eligible staff of the Fund
would be removed from the plan. A separate, Medicare plan would be introduced to them without
any subsidy by the Fund. The non-Medicare retirees would stay in the current active staff plan,
until Medicare-eligible.

It was moved by Trustee Hamburger that the Board accept Plan A, including participation of staff and
retired staff of the Fund, however, with removing any Fund subsidy from both Medicare and non-Medicare
retirees.
NO SECOND: MOTION FAILED
It was then moved by Trustee Wright, seconded by Trustee Hauser that the Board approve Plan A for the
Fund’s active and retired employees, as presented.
