PROPOSED ORDINANCE
ESTABLISHING THE COMMISSION ON COOK COUNTY YOUTH
WHEREAS, there are approximately 1.2 million children residing in Cook County; and
WHEREAS, in 2014 Raj Chetty, Professor of Economics at Harvard University, and Nathaniel Hendren,
Assistant Professor of Economics at Harvard University completed a comprehensive “Equality of Opportunity”
study of the Causal Effects of Growing Up in Each of the 100 Largest Counties in the United States on
Household Income, with household income at age 26 being a key indicator of a socially, economically, and
educationally successful childhood; and

 WHEREAS, the above-referenced “Equality of Opportunity Study,” applying the above criteria ranked DuPage
County number one (1) in the United States in terms of successful childhood outcomes; and
WHEREAS, the same study of the 100 Largest Counties in the United States ranked Cook County number ninety
six (96); and
WHEREAS, the same study of the 100 Largest Counties in the United States ranked Baltimore City number one
hundred (100); and
WHEREAS, the same study of the 100 Largest Counties in the United States and their ultimate impact on the
success of the children that grow up in each of those counties further illustrates that every year a poor child

WHEREAS, the same study of the 100 Largest Counties in the United States and their ultimate impact on the
success of the children that grow up in each of those counties further illustrates that children who move from

college, and more likely to earn more money; and
WHEREAS, a report issued by Drexel University’s Center for Labor Markets and Policy in January 2015 found
an unemployment rate among African American male teens in the City of Chicago of 91%; and
WHEREAS, a report issued by the University of Chicago Crime Lab in March of 2009 examining gun violence
among school age youth found that the key to deterring gun violence among youth was to create opportunities for
youth to engage in pro-social activities, chief among which are job and educational opportunities; and
WHEREAS, it is both in the best interest of Cook County Government and a key responsibility of the officials
tasked with governing Cook County to deeply consider the above findings; and
WHEREAS, Cook County government has an obligation to its residents and taxpayers to do everything possible
to improve the economic, social and cultural outcomes of Cook County children; and
WHEREAS, Cook County government, like all units of local government, has an obligation to its residents and
taxpayers to do everything possible to reduce youth gun violence; and
