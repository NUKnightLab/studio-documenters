RE: Resolution in Support of the Michigan Legislature Enacting Legislation

Extending NEZ New and Rehab Certi?cates that are Expiring

 

Homeownership is a critical element in creating a strong tax base and stabilizing neighborhoods.
Neighborhood Enterprise Zones have played an integral role in encouraging homeownership.
Therefore, I am requesting that the Legislative Policy Division draft a resolution in support of the
Michigan Legislature enacting legislation that would extend NEZ new and rehab certi?cates that
are expiring. In addition, if there is any pending legislation regarding NEZ certi?cates that are
expiring please reference that legislation in your resolution.

Thank you.

From: Council President Pro Tempore Mary Shef?eld 

cc: Honorable Colleagues, Mayor Mike Duggan, LPD, City Clerk
Date: 3/14/2019

Re: Questions for the 36th District Court Budget Hearing

 

1. Projected revenues for Fines, Forfeits, and Penalties are $317,000 less than last year?s
adopted budget.

Why is there a 39% projected decrease in this revenue source? What effect will this have
on the Court?s operations?

2. In an effort to ensure the judicial system does not the favor the rich and punish the
poor, I have proposed the elimination of the cash bail system in Detroit.

How much is collected in cash bails annually and how much is forfeited? What
expenditures are the forfeited cash bail funds used to fund?

3. At a recent Eviction Summit, it was stated that the 36th District Court hears
approximately 35,000 landlord/tenant cases annually. As a part of the People?s Bills I?ve
introduced, I am proposing a Right to Counsel Ordinance for individuals facing eviction.

What percentage of cases and court expenditures are related to landlord/tenant cases?
Will a significant reduction' In the number of these cases save the Court money and time?

4. A number of encounters with law enforcement are a direct result of mental health
issu'efs and consequently involve individuals with addiction problems. The proposed
bud?iet has an 11% decrease in the Drug Court expenditure at a time when the Nation is
mireid in an opiod crisis.
Why? is there a reduction in the expenditure for the Drug Court? What is the adequate level
of funding for the Drug Court and what are the financial and social consequences of failing
to pr?perly fund it?

From: Council President Pro Tempore Mary Sheffield?z?x?
CC: Honorable Colleagues, Mayor Mike Duggan, LPD, City Clerk
Date: 3/12/2019

Re: Questions for the Law Department Budget Hearing

 

1. In response to question regarding increased contractual services costs, the
Law Department indicated some of the funding is related wrongful conviction cases.

0f the indicated eight wrongful conviction lawsuits, each seeking tens of millions of
dollars, outside of litigation is the Law expending resources to identify and correct the
mistakes made which lead to the conviction of innocent citizens and lawsuit filings?

2. Every week City Council is presented with several lawsuit settlements and requests
for indemnification for City employees.

How much of the Law Department?s budget is dedicated to litigating suits against the City
and its employees? Are funds available to assess the nature of the lawsuits and to provide

recommendations and training for City employees to reduce the City's exposure and
lawsuit ?lings?

3. There are a number of legal issues with State and Federal law which negatively impact
the City?s ability to govern and protect City residents and assets. In the Law Department's
Activity Description, there is mention of a legislative liaison and federal lobbyist?

Who holds these positions, who do they report to and what is the cost of these services?

4. There?s a small increase in salary and wages but a decrease in employee benefits.
Does this represent a shift from to contractual employees? If so, what is the effect

if on attrition for the Law Department.
