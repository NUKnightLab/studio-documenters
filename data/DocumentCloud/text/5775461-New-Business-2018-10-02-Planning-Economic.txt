?Project?) and Attachment includes letters of support for the Project.

B. Basis of Eligibility 1? Section 13 and Section 2 

The Property is considered ?eligible property? as de?ned by Act 381, Section 2 because
the Property was previously utilized or is currently utilized for a commercial and
industrial use; it is located within the City of Detroit, a quali?ed local governmental
unit under Act 381; and the Property is determined to be a ?facility? and/or adjacent
and contiguous to a ?facility.?

Currently 20 of the 21 parcels are eligible either because they are determined to be a
?facility? or adjacent and contiguous to a ?facility?. Once the parcel combination into four
lots occurs, the entire Property will be considered eligible.

In 2014, a Phase II Environmental Site Assessment (BSA) was conducted on 1346-1364
Gratiot Avenue and 1350-1366 Service Street. BVNA completed a scope of work
consisting of advancing 12 soils borings, installing one temporary monitoring well, and
collecting 12 soil samples and one groundwater sample for laboratory analysis.

PM Environmental, Inc. (PM) conducted a Phase II BSA in 2015 on the parcels identi?ed
as 1314-1340 and 1380-1388 Gratiot Avenue, 2011-2105 Russell Street, and 1301-1337
and 1399 Maple Street. The 2015 Phase II ESA consisted of 28 soil borings and collection
of 40 soil samples. In addition, two temporary monitoring wells were installed in the
subject building identi?ed as 1325-1337 Maple Street to assess the non-aqueous phase
liquid (NAPL) oil) identi?ed, and a liquid sample and a groundwater sample were
collected for laboratory analysis.

The soil and groundwater concentrations identi?ed exceed the Michigan Department of
Environmental Quality (MDEQ) Part 201 Residential and Nonresidential (Drinking Water
Protection/Drinking Water Groundwater Surface Water Interface
Protection/Groundwater Surface Water Interface Ambient Air Volatile Soil
Inhalation (VSI), Soil Volatilization to Indoor Air Inhalation (SVII) and Direct Contact
(DC) cleanup criteria in soil and groundwater samples collected from the subject property
and the presence of NAPL, the subject property is considered a ?facility? under Part 201
of PA. 451, as amended, and the rules promulgated thereunder.

C. Summarv of Eligible Activities and Description of Costs {Section 13 
The ?eligible activities? that are intended to be carried out at the Property are considered
?eligible activities? as de?ned by Section 2(0) of Act 381, because they include Pre-
Approved Activities, Department Speci?c Activities, Demolition Activities, Asbestos and
Lead Abatement, Infrastructure Improvements, Site Preparation Activities, and Preparation
and Implementation of a Brown?eld Plan/Act 381 Work Plan.

A summary of the eligible activities and the estimated cost of each eligible activity intended
to be paid for with Tax Increment Revenues from the Property are shown in the table

attached hereto as Attachment E. The eligible activities described in Attachment are not
exhaustive. Subject to the approval of DBRA staff in writing, additional eligible activities
may be carried out at the Property, without requiring an amendment to this Plan, so long
as such eligible activities are permitted by Act 381 and the performance of such eligible
activities does not exceed the total costs stated in Attachment E.

It is currently anticipated construction will begin in the spring of 2019 and eligible
activities are slated to be completed within 36 months. Unless otherwise agreed to in
writing by the DBRA, all eligible activities shall commence within thirty-six (36) months
after the date the governing body approves this Plan and be completed within ?ve (5) years
after execution of the Reimbursement Agreement (as that term is de?ned below). Any
long-term monitoring or operation and maintenance activities or obligations that may be
required will be performed in compliance with the terms of this Plan and any documents
prepared pursuant to this Plan.

The Developer desires to be reimbursed for the costs of eligible activities. Tax increment
revenue generated by the Property will be captured by the DBRA and used to reimburse
the cost of the eligible activities completed on the Property after approval of this Plan
pursuant to the terms of a Reimbursement Agreement to be executed by the DBRA and
Developer after approval of this Plan by the governing body (the ?Reimbursement
Agreement?). In the event this Plan contemplates the capture of tax increment revenue
derived from ?taxes levied for school operating purposes? (as defined by Section 2(uu) of
Act 381 and hereinafter referred to as ?School Taxes?), the Developer acknowledges and
agrees that obligation to reimburse the Developer for the cost of eligible activities
with tax increment revenue derived from Local Taxes, or Speci?c Taxes that are

be required pursuant to Act 381, or (ii) the Developer providing the DBRA with evidence,
satisfactory to DBRA, that the Developer has the ?nancial means to complete the project
without the capture of, and subsequent reimbursement with, the contemplated School
Taxes.

The costs listed in Attachment are estimated costs and may increase or decrease
depending on the nature and extent of environmental contamination and other unknown
conditions encountered on the Property. The actual cost of those eligible activities
encompassed by this Plan that will qualify for reimbursement from tax increment revenues
of the DBRA from the Property shall be governed by the terms of the Reimbursement
Agreement. No costs of eligible activities will be quali?ed for reimbursement except to
the extent permitted in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Reimbursement
Agreement and Act 381. The Reimbursement Agreement and this Plan will dictate the
total cost of eligible activities subject to payment, provided that the total cost of eligible
activities subject to payment or reimbursement under the Reimbursement Agreement,

The Developer is seeking a Payment In Lieu of Taxes (PILOT) for residential units that
will be housed within the Russell Street building. It is anticipated these units will be under
a separate condo parcel in the future and will not contribute to Developer TIF
reimbursements. The Developer also anticipates approval of a Commercial Rehabilitation
Act, PA 210 Tax Abatement (CRA), which, if approved, would abate 100% of the
remaining non-land local taxes on the commercial portion of the Property for up to 10
years. In the event the CRA is approved, the tax abatement will reduce the property tax
obligations of the commercial portion of the Property for the periods applicable under the
abatement certi?cate, thereby reducing the amount of tax increment revenues available
under this Plan.

E. Plan of Fina?cine {Section lSt?ZHdl); Maximum Amount oflndebtedness (Section
13(2Men

The eligible activities are to be ?nanced solely by the Developer. The DBRA will
reimburse the Developer for the cost of approved eligible activities, but only from tax
increment revenues generated from the Property. No advances have been or shall be made
by the City or the DBRA for the costs of eligible activities under this Plan.

All reimbursements authorized under this Plan shall be governed by the Reimbursement
Agreement. The inclusion of eligible activities and estimates of costs to be reimbursed in
this Plan are intended to authorize the DBRA to fund such reimbursements and does not
obligate the DBRA or the City to fund any reimbursement or to enter into the
Reimbursement Agreement providing for the reimbursement of any costs for which tax
increment revenues may be captured under this Plan, or which are permitted to be
reimbursed under this Plan. The amount and source of any tax increment revenues that
will be used for purposes authorized by this Plan, and the terms and conditions for such
use and upon any reimbursement of the expenses permitted by the Plan, will be provided
solely under the Reimbursement Agreement contemplated by this Plan.

Unless otherwise agreed upon by the Developer, the DBRA, and the State of Michigan, the
DBRA shall not incur any note or bonded indebtedness to ?nance the purposes of this Plan.

Interest may be paid under this Plan as provided in the Reimbursement Agreement,
provided that to the extent that the Michigan Strategic Fund or Michigan Department of
Environmental Quality does not approve the payment of interest on an eligible activity with
school taxes, interest shall not accrue or be paid under this Plan with respect to the cost of
such eligible activity. Unless otherwise agreed upon by the Developer, the DBRA, and the
State of Michigan, the DBRA may approve interest on the local portion of the
reimbursement to the extent that the projected internal rate of return to the Developer does
not exceed twenty as more speci?cally stated in the Reimbursement Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Plan, at this time, the payment of interest
is not contemplated by this Plan.

Reimbursements under the Reimbursement Agreement shall not exceed the cost of Eligible
Activities permitted under this Plan.

Project Description

Eastern Market Mixed Use Development

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Development Team and Company Synopsis

Develop Detroit is a mission-driven real estate development company that executes
significant housing and revitalization projects throughout Detroit. Operating as a
catalyst to help stabilize and grow key Detroit neighborhoods, Develop Detroit is an
independent nonprofit that builds on the experience and performance of the most
accomplished developers in the nation. Develop Detroit specializes in a wide range of
real estate projects, including multifamily and mixed?use housing developments. single
family home rehabilitation, educational facilities. commercial properties and community
centers. They create housing for a wide range of income types, with a strong focus on
insuring opportunities for Iow- and moderate? income Detroiters to attain quality
housing. Develop Detroit creates sustainable and dynamic communities that promote
economic stability and enhance the quality of life for all residents.

Develop Detroit is partnering with Town Partners (the ?developer?) for this
development. Town Partners (Town) founded in 2012, is focused on multifamily, retail,
and light manufacturing development opportunities that leverage Detroit?s world-class
assets. Town takes an alternative approach to real estate development with a, ?Return
on Community? philosophy where they seek to combine sound investment strategies
with building strong interconnected communities and culture.

Town was created to connect small businesses and the on-the-ground energy in the
city of Detroit to well-designed, unique spaces that transform the communities in which
they are developed. Town combines sound real estate investment and management
principles with local market knowledge, alternative financing strategies, and a formal
tenant recruitment process to build globally recognized developments in the city of
Detroit.

Develop Detroit and Town Partners has recognized the potential for redevelopment of
the blighted properties immediately surrounding Eastern Market and the opportunity to
create a development that compliments Eastern Market and would offer services in the
neighborhood beyond Eastern Market's typical 9am-5pm hours. The location for this
redevelopment is situated near the southern entrance of Eastern Market.

Project Synopsis
The proposed residential use will be situated along Gratiot Avenue and Russell Street
with a minimum of 200 units. It is anticipated that the rental rates will consist of 60%

market rate and 40% aside for affordable housing (Le. 80% AMI or lower).

The Development team is seeking additional financing sources to be able to offer an
expanded affordable component to the project.

Common space will be included for residents to add to the sense of community the
developer intends to create. The building along Russell Street will be developed to

Attachment 
Page 1

allow for parking below the building. The parking structure will be located in the central
portion of the property on the service street parcels. The facades of the existing
warehouse building will partially wrap and obscure the structure. Overall there will be a
minimum of 200 parking stalls, both structured and surface to accommodate the
development.

Retail and commercial spaces will front Gratiot Avenue and Maple Street and will
include a minimum of 20,000 square feet, which will be a mix of new construction and
rehab of existing structures. This is inclusive of live/work spaces as well as anticipated
restaurant/bar uses and additional tenants to support the overall Eastern Market
economy.

The developer will create greenspace behind the Russell Street building as well as a
piazza on the western portion of the property, creating a gathering node within the
district. The commercial and retail tenants that will populate the development will
garner visitors and encourage a 24/7 atmOSphere.

The developer anticipates 40 full time equivalent (FTE) jobs associated with the
commercial and retail aspects of the proposed development will be created. Of the 40
jobs, 4 are anticipated to be direct jobs. The remainder will be indirect associated with
future office, retail, and commercial tenants.

Upon completion, this project will bring a contaminated and dilapidated space back to
productive use, addressing the growing demand for office, retail, and affordable,
inclusive residential uses. It will further catalyze economic development in the area,
including Lafayette Park, Eastern Market and Downtown.

Project Investment Estimates to Date

Hard Costs: Approximately $70 million
Soft Costs: Approximately $20 million
Total Costs: Approximately $89-90 million

Additional Financing Incentives Associated with the Redevelopment

The Developer is also pursuing the following at this time:

A Commercial Rehabilitation Act (CRA) Tax Exemption (Public Act 210)
HOME Funding from the City of Detroit

Project-Based Vouchers from the Detroit Housing Commission

Low Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC)

Economic Benefit Analysis

The proposed Development will create a community urban core and centerpiece
between Eastern Market, the downtown, and Lafayette Park. Through its display and
accessibility to local food products and retail, the Development will attract local talent
and bring a high-density of residents and visitors to the area.

Attachment 
Page 2

Upon completion, the Development will also serve as a retail, restaurant, and
entertainment venue and offer a destination spot that will be accessible and open
beyond the Eastern Market?s typical 9am to 5pm hours. Activation of this property will
spur further growth and act as a catalyst for future redevelopment of numerous vacant
and blighted properties along the Gratiot Avenue corridor and the surrounding
neighborhoods and provide spinoff consumer spending in Eastern Market.

The mixed-use nature that the Development will create will spur a vibrant culture and
facilitate social and economic growth for residents and visitors. Additionally, the
developer recognizes the potential for this space to capture the community demand for
a 24/7 hub. Through retail and high foot traffic, the Development will aid in stabilizing
the neighborhood, create jobs, increase density, and strengthen security.

Upon successful redevelopment, the Development will generate increased income
taxes, through the new jobs and residents that the project will create.

On a short term basis approximately 70 construction jobs will be created, and on a
long-term basis the proposed redevelopment associated with the District will create
approximately 40 full-time equivalent (FTE) jobs. The developer has already presented
at a D2D meeting and Skilled Trades Task Force, and intends to present again as the
contractor procurement process is finalized, to ensure Detroit-based contractors and
workers benefit from the redevelopment.

It will further help meet the demand for housing in Detroit which will generate new
income tax in addition to the jobs created and amount of private investment.
Investments in the community such as this that will have long-term effects and provide
sustainable principals will retain and foster local talent that is vital to securing the
City?s economic future.

The proposed redevelopment will house new Detroit residents and workers through the
overall vision of creating live/work space and a 24/7 walkable community. Therefore, it
is anticipated the City of Detroit will collect approximately 2.5% income tax per resident
per year.

Detroit Underwriting Branch Chief
US Department of Housing and Urban Development

Dear Chris Nielsen,

larn writing to express support for Develop Detroit's Eastern Market Development as they pursue financing from the
Department of Housing and Urban Development.

The City of Detroit Planning 8; Development Department has been working with the developer through the conceptual
phase of the project. The proposed design is consistent with the city's vision for the site and urban design guidelines. The
Developer has shared feedback from the HUD concept meeting last fall, and we feel it Is appropriate to speak to quations
and concerns raised at that time; namely the site's connectivity to Downtown and adjacent neighborhoods, synergistic
development activity in the immediate area, market support of the proposed commercial square footage, and the
configuration of the proposed project?s parking.

Regarding connectivity: The development site sits at the crossroads of three major districts of the city - the Central
Business District to the west, Eastern Market to the north and the Lafayette Park neighborhood to the south. The city,
working with the state, is preparing to improve the connections to downtown by converting i-S'i's and the Fisher Freeway
extension [Gratiot Connector} to an urban surface boulevard. This will provide for better connectivity and mobility options
consistent with the urban environment desired by the City of Detroit. Construction is slated to start In 2022. Additionally,
there are plans to connect Russell Street in the south to Antietam Street - better connecting Lafayette Park to Eastern
Market.

Regarding synergistic development: The Eastern Market Development advances widely accepted urban design principles:
multl-use deveIOpment with active street frontage, parking that is positioned behind active uses, location along roots with
enhanced-transit bus, 

Regarding market support: The City of Detroit, in recognizing the potential of Eastern Market, has engaged in an economic
and planning study, to guide growth for what is already one of the largest job centers in the city.

Regarding parking con?guration: The City of Detroit?s zoning ordinance discourages parking facilities facing Gateway Radial
Thoroughfare Overlay Areas. The parking design and location is consistent with urban design principles as noted in our
Ordinance.

I sincerely thank you for your consideration of this project. Our of?ce is available to assist in answering any questions you
may have.

Very Best Regards, .
?If;

Dear Planning Commission Members:

Eastern Market Corporation (EMC) strongly supports Develop Detroit's Eastern Market
Gateway, the proposed mixed-use project located at Russell Street and Gratiot Avenue.

Develop Detroit and its design team have developed a project that is consistent with
development strategies outlined in Eastern Market 2025 the ten year strategy was developed to
preserve the market's authenticity and character as a tsunami of investment hits Eastern Market.

Specifically, EMC is keen to preserve opportunities for smaller, independent businesses and to
assure that the market district remains a place where anyone, regardless of their income, can
flourish. We especially support the project residential mix and the creation of smaller retail
spaces. The 40:60 ratio of affordable to market rate housing helps ensure that people working
in the Eastern Market District can live nearby reducing dependency on the automobile and
increasing the opportunity for household wealth creation.

Develop Detroit and its design team have also taken into account the site's history and its
proximity to Eastern Market to develop a program that incorporates murals and the vibrancy of
Service Street into its plans.

Further, Develop Detroit has developed its program with significant input from our organization
as well as addressing concerns of local residents and businesses that were voiced at community
meetings held at Eastern Market.

EMC appreciates the inclusion of Eastern Market many stakeholders in the planning process
and their dedication to maintaining the character of the area. I look forward to this project
contributing to the continued growth of the Eastern Market community and greater Detroit.

Sincerely,

Jul 11, 2018

Pursuant to Section 25-2-7 of the 1984 Detroit City Code, the Planning and Development Department has
requested that the Detroit Historic District Commission (?Commission?) review and comment on the
effects the proposed new development (located at 1314-1388 Gratiot Avenue; 2011-2105 Russell Street;
1301 -1399 Maple Street, and 1350-1366 Service Street) will have on the adjacent Trinity Lutheran Church
and St. I ohns/ St. Luke Evangelical Church Historic Districts.

The Commission reviewed the project at the July 1 1, 2018 regular meeting and determined that the project
will be complementary to the adjacent historic districts based upon the modern esthetic, scale, and massing.
The development clearly distinguishes itself, but is compatible to the adjacent Trinity Lutheran Church and
St. I ohns/ St. Luke Evangelical Church Historic Districts and the nearby Lafayette Park Historic District.

have reviewed the plans and believe this would be a great addition to connect the
market with the downtown area.

We appreciate being invited to multiple community engagement meetings and further
that Develop Detroit has implemented ideas that were discussed during this process.

As an Eastern Market Business Property Owner, we appreciate the inclusion of the
community in the planning process and am pleased to see the direction of the program.
We look forward to this project contributing to the continued growth of the Eastern
Market community and greater.

Dear City of Detroit City Planning Commission Members:

BASCO of Michigan would like to express our full support for Develop Detroit?s proposed
Eastern Market Mixed Use Development located at Russell Street and Gratiot Avenue. We are
developing the north-west comer across the street and we feel both projects complement one
another as gateway projects to the Eastern Market District.

Develop Detroit and its design team has considered the site?s history and its proximity to
Eastern Market to develop a program that incorporates murals and the vibrant nature of the
market into the aesthetic of the design. We have made note of this through the sharing of their
preliminary designs with us. In addition, we understand that the development program has been
designed to include concerns of local residents and businesses with the design team conducting
community meetings at Eastern Market throughout Develop Detroit?s community engagement
process.

The development is a mixed use, retail and residential program which will include creation of a
retail alley on Service St., a green roof on the current vacant Maple St. warehouse and additional
parking through a garage amenities that residents and the public will enjoy alike. It will
contribute to increasing the walkability and density of the neighborhood, as well as strengthen
economic development in the area.

As an Eastern Market Business 61: Property Owner, I appreciate the inclusion of the community
in the planning process and am pleased to see the direction of the program. I look forward to this
proj eel contributing to the continued growth of the Eastern Market community and greater
Detroit.

Respectfully,

Hi Paul,

Jennifer Kanalos and Brian Vosburg asked that I reach out to confirm the "facility? status of parcels related to a
Brownfield Plan submission. The project consists of 21 parcels that are slated to be combined into one as part ofthe
overall project.

The parcel combination will occur prior to City Council Brownfield Plan approval and therefore at the time of the
approval will be a single parcel.

I?ve uploaded the following for reference and confirmation: Eastern Market Gateway

1. Current Parcel Map outlining the Subject Property and associated Address
2. Applicable BEA text, maps, and figures for the Subject Property
3. Proposed Parcel Map for once parcel combination occurs

I know Michelle Bakun is out this week, so wanted to see if you'd be able to provide confirmation.
Please let me know ifl can provide any additional information.

The Neighborhood Enterprise Zone (NEZ) Program was
established by Public Act 147 of 1992, as amended. The
program provides a tax incentive for the development and
rehabilitation of residential housing. A qualified local unit
of government may designate one or more areas as a NEZ
within that local unit of government. The program was
established to spur the development and rehabilitation
of residential housing in communities where it may not
otherwise occur. The program also encourages owners
occupied housing and new investment in communities.

A qualified local unit of government, as defined under Sec-
tion 2 of the Obsolete Property Rehabilitation Act 2000 PA
14-6, or a county seat.

A cornn'iunitg.r will reduce the taxes on. property for up to
15 years in designated areas to promote the revitalization
of those neighborhoods. Developers and owners must first
seek approval for the NEZ benefits before starting a proj-
ect. There are three different types of projects that can be
undertaken in an NEZ:
A homestead facility is defined as an existing struc-
ture, purchased by or transferred to an owner after
December 31, 1996, that has as its primary purpose
residential housing consisting of one or two units,
one of which is occupied by an owner as their prin-
ciple residence and that is located within a platted
subdivision.

A rehabilitated facility is defined as an existing
structure or a portion of an existing structure with
a current true cash value of $80,000 or less per unit
that has or will have as its primary purpose residen?
tial housing consisting of 1?8 units.

A new facility is defined as a new structure or
portion of a new structure that has as its primary
purpose residential housing consisting of one or
two units, one of which will be owner occupied as
a principal residence. This definition includes a
new individual condominium unit, in a structure

I02008 Michigan Economic Ih'vi-lnpmem Corporation

with one or more condominium units, that has as
its primary purpose residential housing which will
be owner-occupied as a principal residence. Except
when project meet ALL of the following items, a
new facility does not include apartments:

- Rented or leased or is available for rent or lease.

A mixed use building or located in a mixed use
building that contains retail business space on
street level floor.

Located in a qualified downtown district (DDA,
PSD, or boundaries identified by the local gov?
ernment in an area zoned and primarily used
for business).

The following steps are offered as general guidelines
only and the legislation should be reviewed by local offi?
cials prior to starting the designation process.

The governing body of a qualified local unit of govern?
ment by resolution may designate one or more NEZs
within that local governmental unit. The NEZ must
contain, at a minimum, platted parcels of land and

the land must be compact and contiguous. Minimum
number of parcels and maximum percent of acreage
vary depending on type of designation.

Written notice is provided to the assessor and to the
governing body of each taxing unit not less than 60
days before passing the resolution designating a NEZ.

The governing body makes a finding that the pro?
posed NEZ is consistent with the master plan, neigh-
borhood preservation and economic development
goals of the local governmental unit.

The governing body adopts a statement of the local
unit of government?s goals, objectives and policies rel-
ative to the maintenance, preservation, improvement
and development of housing for all persons regardless
of income level living within the proposed NEZ.

The governing body passes a housing inspection

ordinance that, at a minimum, requires that before
the sale of a unit in a new or rehabilitated facility for
which a NEZ certificate is in effect, an inspection is
made of the unit to determine compliance with any
local construction or safety codes and that a sale may
not be finalized until there is compliance with those
local codes.

. The governing body holds a public hearing not later

than 45 days after the date the notice is sent but before
acting upon resolution.

the amount of true cash value of the property located
within the proposed NEZ and any other information
considered necessary by the governing body.

. The clerk of the governing body notifies the state tax

commission of resolution passage, including a copy of
the resolution and a listing of each parcel located in the
NEZ, showing parcel code numbers and addressesowner or developer (or prospective owner or devel?

oper) of a proposed new facility or proposing to rehab
property in a NEZ files an application for an EZ
certi?cate with the clerk of the local government. The
application must be filed BEFORE a building permit is
issued for the new construction or rehabilitation of the
facility, unless they qualify for the exceptions provided
for in Section 4- (2) of the Act.

1.2. An owner/developer obtains a building permit and

submits a copy to the local unit of government.

by the owner as a principal residence, a certificate
that the improvements have met the minimum
cost requirements and the local building code
standards issued by the local building inspector,
and a certificate of occupancy if required by the
local building permits or codes.

The local government will forward an application ap
proved by resolution and the appropriate documenta?
tion (building permit, resolution contractor estimates,
legal description and parcel number) to the state tax
commission within 60 days of receiving it.

The State Tax Commission will issue a certificate to

the applicant if it is determined that the facility com?
plies with the NEZ program requirements within 60
days of receipt of the complete application from local
government. Copies of the certificate will be sent to
the applicant, assessor?s office and each affected tax?
ing unit.

Improvements, if done by a licensed contractor, are
estimated at more than $5,000 per owner?occupied
unit or 50% of the true cash value (whichever is less),
or $7,500 per non?owner?occupied unit or 50% of the
true cash value (whichever is less).

If the owner proposes improvements that would be
done by the owner, the cost of the materials must be
in excess of $3,000 per owner?occupied unit or $4,500
per non-owner?occupied unit. Improvements estimat?
ed by the owner should not include the cost of labor.

These improvements must bring the structure into
conformance with minimum building code standards.
A rehabilitated facility does not include a facility reha?
bilitated with the proceeds of an insurance policy for
property or casualty loss.

the date of occupancy by the owner as a principal
resident.

(fife-Upon the request of the owner, the effective

date of the NEZ for a rehabilitated facility shall be
December 31 in the year immediately preceding the
date on which the rehabilitated facility is substantially

Certificates are effective for up to 15 years, depending
on the local government unit and the type of project.

A certificate can be transferred to succeeding prop?

erty owners within the 12 years provided that the new
owner meets the NEZ requirements for the program.

A certificate expires if an owner fails to complete the
filing within two years after the certificate is issued.

structure is not in compliance with local con-
struction, building or safety codes.

Requests for certificate revocation must be made to

RE: RECOMMENDED REVISIONS TO THE COMMUNITY BENEFITS

ORDINANCE

This report follows the Legislative Policy Division?s (LPD) report dated July 23, 2018 (attached)
in which LPD staff provided a list of recommendations which would either strengthen or revise
the city?s current Community Bene?ts Ordinance (CBO) process as outlined in Chapter 14 of the
1984 Detroit City Code, Community Development, Article 12 Community Bene?ts.

In a memorandum dated August 30, 2018 Council President Pro Tern Mary Shef?eld requested
that LPD incorporate the aforementioned recommendations and others in a draft ordinance to be
considered by the Committee of the Whole. At the Flaming and Economic Development
Standing Committee meeting of September 6, 2018, Chairman Tate requested that interested
Councilmembers submit their lists of recommended revisions to the Community Bene?ts
Ordinance to LPD by Friday, September 21, 2018 for consideration.

To date, responses have been received from the of?ces of Councilmembers? Jones, McCalister

- That Sec. 14-12-2 De?nitions be revised to read as follows: ?Tier 3? Development

mandated 51% Detroit resident hiring requirement shall provide support Funding for
training assistance for Detroit residence in apprenticeship, trade and vocational and
technical training and certi?cations.

- That Sec. 14-12?5 Exemptions; Section 1 be stricken.
President Jones

I The title should remain as Community Bene?ts Ordinance. The threshold limits should
be aligned to re?ect the average development project cost/investment 
1(a) The tiers required for CBO participation should be lowered to projects with
$300,000 of public investment, and the top tier should be lowered to investments
or more. Requiring more developments that receive public
investment to undergo the CBO.

Recommending that a new section be added in which it is made clear that the CBO
process must be a legally binding contractual agreement between the NAC and the
developer. A CBO report should document the ?nal results of the CBO process, which
should be the creation of a legally binding community bene?ts agreement signed by the
developer and the NAC. The CEO process should not be permitted to close until a
community bene?ts agreement is created through authentic negotiation between
community members and developers which includes speci?c and tangible bene?ts
advocated for by the community.

0 The NAC should have ?no fewer than six (6) community meetings, unless a majority of
the NAC deems otherwise?.

2(a) The NAC should be appointed by their community within their
census track and not by the city.

0 During the ?rst meeting those that are interested in being NAC members should be
identi?ed and during the second meeting, those interested in being NAC members
must come formally prepared to state their interest in the NAC.

3 Residents who have competing a?iliations or interests that may result in
the perception or the reality ofan increased risk ofbias or poor judgment in
upholding the NA Member responsibility to prioritize the interests of
community residents over the interests of city o?cials and developers, should
be restricted/90m serving on the NA C. This may include current or past
employment a?iliated with the developer or the city. Residents who have
affiliations with entities that create competing responsibilities or threaten to
jeopardize the NAC Member responsibility to prioritize the interest of
community residents over the interest ofcity o?icials and developers, should
also be restrictedfrom serving on the NA C.

'l'here should he one alternate selected by the community. The person with the third
highest votes From the community should be listed at the alternate person. This

person must agree to be present at all meetings and will be noti?ed by the Planning
Department when they are needed to formally replace a NAC member.

It is recommended that a NAC member not be absent for more than ?one?
meeting. Additional absences could disqualify one from further being a NAC
member.

That all essential documents to be provided and/or emailed to the NAC Members,
District and At-Large City Council members within 48 hrs. of the NAC selection.
This will provide the NAC greater transparency with adequate time for review.
(Example of Relevant Documents: Detroit Community Bene?ts Ordinance,
development agreements between the city and developer, details of project
?nancing/ project proforma, developer's RFP response, all renderings related to the
project, But/F or Economic Analysis conducted by DEGC, all environmental
studies, documents related to brown?eld funding, etc.)

In regards to recommendation that if a proposed development includes
residential housing, that a least 20% affordability at 80% Area Median Income
(AMI) be incorporated into a single-site development; it is believed that this item
should be included in the inclusionary zoning ordinance and the in the CBO
ordinance.

In regards to the proposed addition of Section The ordinance should
restrict developers who do not participate in the CBO process in good faith from
receiving requested public bene?ts for their development projects. Developers who
refuse to negotiate or provide any of the community bene?ts requested by the NAC,
should not be permitted to present their development to City Council for public
investment approval. The ordinance should also include provisions that
automatically trigger clawbacks and suspensions of public investment in the case of
developer noncompliance

services provided to Detroit residents and help guide our housing strategy. Please
keep in mind that Dr. Chandan has offered the use of his students to help develop
the housing resource portal and think through how Detroit leverages the OZ
program to bene?t our residents.

Petition for Section 7n Property Tax Exemption

Detroit,- MI 48226

'Re: Rock Economic Development Group Petition for Property Tax Exemption
Pursuant to 2211.7tt

.Hononilble. City Council:

in. connection with the development of the new Wayne County Criminal Justice Center,-
RockEconomic' Development Group hereby requests that this Honorable Body adopt
a resolution pursuant to Section 'Ftt of the General Property Tax Act (MCL 211.7tt) to exempt the-
property described on Exhibit A (collectively, the ?Property") Earn the collection of property
taxes. The Property consists of Wayne County?s ?failed jail" site, the Frank Murphy Hall of
Justice, the Wayne County Juvenile Detention Center, and the Wayne Colmty Division 1 and
Division 2 Jails. The Property has long been exempt taxation.

Background

REDG is :a non-pro?t, unincorporated association whose primary purpose or
combining parcels of real property for economic development purposes.

As has been widely reported, the Property is being conveyed to REDG as consideration
for the. agreement of other Rock entities to construct the new Wayne County Criminal Justice
Center for Wayne County (the ?County?), and to bear the cost in excess of the available. County-
?mds. Because the Property serves a?s't'he consideration, conveyance of the Property at this time
(long before the Property will be available for redevelopment) is necessary to make the
construction of the new Wayne County Criminal Justice Center possible.

With theexception of the failed jail site, the County will continue to operate the Property
until the completion of the new Wayne County Criminal Justice Center. Specifically, REDG has
leased back the currently operational criminal justice facilities (the Frank Murphy Hall of Justice,
the Wayne County Juvenile Detention Center, and the Wayne. County Division 1. and Division 2
Jails) to the County for $1.00, and these properties Will continue to open-rte as public criminal
justice facilities. (Sec Lease of Operational Criminal Justice Facilities, attached hereto as Exhibit
B). For all practical pin-poses, they remain County facilities..-

Dueto Wayne County?s previous issuance of tax-exempt bonds for the jail construction,
the failed jail site had to be separately conveyed to REDG- to comply with requirements. It
Will not be subject to the $1.00 lease, as it is not an operational facility. However, the failed jail

site will beheld by REDG. on a nonpro?t basis and will not be redeveloped until theentiretyof
"tho Property is vacated by the County and available for comprehensive redevelopment.?

Recognizing that (1) the conveyance of tlte'Property is necessary to enable delivery of the
new Criminal Justice Center, (2) because of this necessity, the. conveyance is occurring well in
advance of the ability to redevelop the Property, and (3) the Property will remain substantially
occupied by the County, the Wayne County Criminal lus?ee Center deal contemplated that the
Property would remain exempt from taxation pursuant to Section in of the General Property Tax
Act for the ?holding period? during which REDG is holding the Property on a non-pro?t basis for
future redevelopment. (See Section 8.12 of the Development and Purchase-and Sale Agreement,
attached hereto as Exhibit D). REDG now seeks this Honorable Body?s consideration and
approvaliof this exemption.

Exemption for Property Held by 'a N'ouLPro?tEcon'omic Development Group

Section 7tt of the-General Property Tax Act, permits the City Council ?to
adopt a resolution exempting, for up to seven years, real property that is owned by an ?eligible
economic development group". MCL de?nes an ?eligible economic development
as ?a nonpro?t organization, the primary purpose of which is the economic development
of real property or combining parcels of real property for economic development purposes."

REDG quali?es as an economic development group under the statute because it is a non-
pro?t, unincorporated association formed under Delaware law whose primary purpose is the
economic development of real property or combining parcels of real property for economic
development purposes. (See Agreement of Members of Rock Economic Beyelopmenl Group,
attached hereto as Exhibit E.)

The exemption is requested for the seven year allowable period or until such time as the
develdpment- of the Property is commenced, whichever is earlier. Accordingly, the exemption
would be effective December 31, 2018 and would remain in effect until December 30, 2025 or
until such time as development of the Property commences, if earlier. if development of "any
portion of the Property commences prior to December 31, 2025, the exemptionfor that portion
would t'enninate..

It is important to emphasize that the exemption is only for the period of time the Property
is held by REDG pending future development {the ?ltoiding period?) and will end when
development commencesr Any tax abatement or other incentives for ?iture development would
have to be sought in connection with the redevelopment.

 

and -a'Roek af?liate (1?203 Woodward LLC) have entered into an agreement whereby the Rock
af?liate has the right to use the failed jail site for construction parking for other projects in dovmtown Detroit'in
exchange for funding the demolition of the partially completed jail. This arrangement provides the means for the
failed jail site to be cleared for ?imre redevelopment, in ?n'therance ct non-pro?t economic development-
purpose. (See Demolition Agreement Gratiot Jail Site, attached ,heret?o-da?xhibit G.)

Rock Economic Development Group
Petition for Section 7n Property Tax Exemption

As a ?nal matter, it should be noted that Section 7tt(6) allows the county in which the
exemption is being granted to withdraw its millages from the exemption, such that those mills
would continue to be levied. Wayne County has agreed that it will withdraw its millages if the
exemption is approved, and that property taxes levied by Wayne County mil be subject to the
exemption. (See Section 8.12 of the Development and Purchase and Sale Agreement, attached
hereto as Exhibit D).

The requested exemption is an integral part of projects that will have a substantial positive
impact on economic development in the City. The construction of a new Wayne County Criminal
Justice Center is a major public works project that will generate signi?cant economic impact while
consolidating and modernizing criminal justice operations, meeting ori?ce] capacity needs, and
improving conditions. Moreover, once that project is completed, the Property will be available for
productive redevelopment.

REDG appreciates the City Council?s consideration of this important matter.
