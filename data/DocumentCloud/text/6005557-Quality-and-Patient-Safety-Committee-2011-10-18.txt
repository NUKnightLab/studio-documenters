Concerned Citizen

Report from System Chief Medical Officer
A. Update on Employee Influenza Vaccination Program
Dr. Patricia Kelleher, System Director of Employee Health Services, provided an update on the Employee
Influenza Vaccination Program. She stated that the percentage of employees receiving the vaccination has
increased over the past two years from 25% to 60-80% (ranging from System-wide and affiliate totals). Dr.
Kelleher stated that last year, 59% of employees System-wide received the vaccination; she noted that this
was an improvement over past years’ vaccination rates.

III.

Report from System Chief Medical Officer
A. Update on Employee Influenza Vaccination Program (continued)
She stated that educational programs are ongoing, and that the Program receives strong support from the
administration. She noted that there are some funding issues that need to be addressed. It has been a
challenge to manually track compliance and enforcement; there is a need for the procurement of software to
track this information.
Ms. Merryweather referenced the immunization rates for agency nurses; she noted that these nurses are
most often not immunized with the influenza vaccination. This is a challenge for an organization with high
usage of agency nurses. Dr. Kelleher stated that, in the past couple of years, Human Resources has not let
contracted staff receive an identification badge unless they have received their vaccination.
Chairman Ansell thanked Dr. Kelleher for her update, and requested that the Committee receive periodic
updates on the Program, beginning in December.

B. Update on transition activities for Oak Forest Health Center
Dr. Claudia Fegan, Associate Chief Medical Officer of the Ambulatory and Community Health Network of
Cook County, stated that management is beginning to take a closer look at the patients seen at Oak Forest,
and to review the problems associated with transitioning an emergency department into an Immediate Care
Center. She noted that 84 patients were transferred from Oak Forest Health Center last month.
Dr. Fegan stated that a group was convened to review the message sent to the public and staff about the
Immediate Care Center at Oak Forest. Two recommendations came from this activity: 1) the Immediate
Care Center should be re-named, to instead refer to it as the 24-hour Doctors’ Office; and 2) consider
relocating it into the building where the rest of the clinic activities occur.

IV.

Report from System Chief Clinical Officer (Attachment #1)
Roz Lennon, System Chief Clinical Officer, provided an update on nurse staffing. Additionally, she presented
an update on the Nursing Handoff Project. The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.

filling positions. Antoinette Williams, Chief Nursing Officer at John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County,
provided additional information regarding shortages in nursing. Deborah Tate, System Chief of Human
Resources, provided information regarding the tracking and monitoring of recruitment and hiring for positions.
Chairman Ansell asked Barbara Farrell, System Director of Quality and Patient Safety, to develop a measure
relating to this issue for the Quality dashboard; additionally, he stated that a plan needs to be developed with
medical staff leaders to determine how to address the issue.

2. Meet criteria or have a process in place, need to
implement a “certified system”
