We recently completed a Request for Proposal (RFP) bid process for the Vision Benefit Program.
Request for Proposals were sent to the following companies: Cole Managed Vision, Spectera, Davis,
Inc., Eye Care Plan of America and Vision Service Plan. Each company had responded and is capable of
providing adequate vision services to our employees and their families.
Based on an extensive financial analysis and overall evaluation of benefits, two finalists were selected:
Cole Managed Vision and Spectera. I recommend the selection of Cole Managed Vision based on the
following rationale: lowest costs for examinations, spectacle lenses, contacts and frames; largest provider
network in Cook County with 140 locations; high level of satisfaction for Cook County employees since
1995; responsive service and ease of administration to covered members; very competitive administrative
fee; and three-year rate guarantees for materials and services.
All fees and expenses will be paid from the following accounts:
Corporate/Grant:
Public Safety:
Health Fund:
Forest Preserve District:

490-179
499-179
899-179
490-817

The actual charges for each fund will be dependent upon the actual monthly utilization. Sufficient funds
have been appropriated for these expenditures.
This will allow Cook County employees to continue to participate in the Vision Care program.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 19, 2000
Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Committee on Finance of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County met pursuant to notice for a
public hearing on Thursday, December 7, 2000 at the hour of 10:30 A.M. in the Board Room, Room 569,
County Building, 118 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois, to consider the 2001 Proposed Property Tax
Levy for the County of Cook.
Chairman Daley stated this meeting is being held in compliance with State law for informational purposes
only. It is also being held in compliance with the Truth in Taxation Act, which requires taxing bodies to
disclose by publication and to hold a public hearing with regard to the adoption of a tax levy. The Act
requires a notice of the public hearing be published in a newspaper of general circulation within the
taxing district.
Chairman Daley asked Secretary Williams if we complied with the publication provision?
Secretary Williams responded in the affirmative.
Chairman Daley further stated that in accordance with the Truth in Taxation Act, the date of the public
hearing shall be the first Thursday in December, which is today.
Chairman Daley asked the Secretary to read the notice into the record.
Commissioner Lechowicz, seconded by Commissioner Steele, moved to incorporate into the record
the attached Memorandum and charts submitted by Chairman Daley. The motion carried
unanimously. (The referenced documents are on file in the Office of the County Clerk.)
Chairman Daley asked Thomas Glaser, Chief Financial Officer, to explain the reasons for the Proposed
Property Tax Levy.
Mr. Glaser gave an overview of the tax levy by fund, as reflected in the attached charts.
Commissioner Lechowicz asked the reason for the increase from $201,867,242 to $210,598,897, in the
Public Safety Fund?
Mr. Glaser responded the increase is attributable to several factors, such as arbitration hearings wherein
the County was on the unfavorable end that increased payroll costs by $10,000,000, and union contracts
that had COLA increases of 3% in addition to automatic step increases.
Commissioner Lechowicz, seconded by Commissioner Steele, moved to accept Mr. Glaser's
presentation in ensuring that the County has complied with the State statute with reference to the
2001 Proposed Property Tax Levy. A Roll Call was taken, the vote of yeas and nays being as
follows:

253

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 19, 2000
Commissioner Hansen, seconded by Commissioner Sims, moved approval of Communication No.
240222. The motion carried.
240223

OFFICE OF CAPITAL PLANNING AND POLICY, by Michael E. LaMont, Director,
transmitting a Communication, dated November 17, 2000:
Transmitted herewith for your approval is a request to enter into a professional services
contract with ERNEST R. SAWYER INC./OPPIDAN INC. Joint Venture in the amount of
$824,000.00 for architectural/engineering services for the Countywide ADA Compliance
Project - Phase II. It is respectfully requested that this honorable body approve this request.
In phase I over 55 facilities were surveyed for ADA compliance and the "Transition Plan
Report" was completed. Phase II provides for preparation of construction documents from
the design services through the construction phase using the Transition Report and current
laws and regulations as guidelines.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: $824,000.00. Bond Issue (20000 Account).
Sufficient funds have been appropriated to cover this request.
*Referred to the Construction Committee on December 5, 2000.

Commissioner Silvestri asked when Phase II is expected to be complete.
Michael LaMont responded that a schedule of Phase II is in the backup material. He indicated eight
months were added to both the design and construction. He concluded by stating that construction should
begin March 21, 2002 and by March 2003 the project should be ADA compliant.
Commissioner Hansen referred to certain language relative to other municipal building codes. He
suggested that the language "other applicable building codes" be included in the referenced language.
Michael LaMont agreed with the commissioner's comment.
Commissioner Hansen asked if the design for the new Cook County Hospital is ADA compliant?
Michael LaMont responded that the design for the new Cook County Hospital is ADA compliant.
Commissioner Hansen asked if the executive cost summary includes everything needed for the new Cook
County Hospital?
Michael LaMont stated that it is intended to include everything, but if some things were not included in
the present program they would be covered under another existing program.
Commissioner Hansen asked if ADA compliance in the County Building and 69 West Washington are
included?
Michael LaMont responded that the 69 West Washington building is not included because ADA
improvements are being made as part of the $26 million building renovation costs.
Commissioner Hansen asked if the committee can have a better explanation regarding counter heights,
minor hardware mounting heights, minor public toilet room issues and alarms?

254

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 19, 2000
Michael LaMont asked the project consultant to respond.
Ernest Sawyer, representing ERS, Inc./OPPIDAN Inc., stated that an analysis of each facility was made in
relationship to ADA requirements. He stated that the counters at the Rolling Meadows Courthouse are
not wheelchair accessible. He said the project includes a design where the counters will be lower and
include a ramp so a handicapped person can move closer to the counter.
Commissioner Hansen asked if there would be two levels of counters?
Ernest Sawyer responded asked the design architect to respond to the question.
Robert Robicsek, Environ, Inc. stated that when a building is renovated, two different height counters are
designed where one counter could be as high as 3' 6" and handicap accessible counters would be much
lower.
Commissioner Hansen asked the consultant to define the term "minor hardware mounting"?
Ernest Sawyer responded that the term applies to accessible door hardware into a particular location. Mr.
Sawyer further stated that all facilities were reviewed and analyzed relative to entry doors and hardware
issues.
Commissioner Hansen asked if there would be two sets of handles on each door?
Ernest Sawyer stated that ADA standard hardware is used on the doors. He said forty-two inches is the
standard ADA height for door handles.
Commissioner Hansen stated that the doors in the Cook County Building on Randolph and Washington
Streets are too hard to open for someone who is in a wheelchair.
Michael LaMont stated that the ADA accessible entrance to the County Building is the Clark Street
entrance that has a push button door. He said the doors are relatively new but will have the balance
checked.
Commissioner Hansen asked someone to address the alarm system.
Robert Robicsek stated the alarm system is a two-alarm system that meets ADA requirements for visual
strobes and alarm horns that require low voltage.
Commissioner Hansen asked the type of alarm system.
Robert Robicsek responded that it is a fire alarm system.
Commissioner Hansen asked what are the minor public toilet room issues?
Ernest Sawyer stated that the issues include widening the stalls to accommodate wheelchairs and lowering
the urinals in the older buildings.
Commissioner Hansen asked the total budget for the project.
Michael LaMont responded that the total budget is $8.3 million.

255

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 19, 2000
Commissioner Silvestri asked if 69 West Washington is ADA compliant?
Michael LaMont responded that dollars for ADA compliance were authorized when the building was
purchased so this issue is being handled by the building manager.
Commissioner Silvestri asked if federal funding is available to support ADA compliance in the buildings?
Michael LaMont responded he is unaware of available federal funds and thinks all public agencies are
faced with the same regulations.
Chairman Carr stated that in most cases Community Development Block Grant dollars are available.
Commissioner Silvestri asked if Community Development Block Grant dollars are being used for the
County project?
Michael LaMont stated no outside dollars are being used to fund the project.
Commissioner Silvestri suggested the County look for outside funding sources.
Michael LaMont stated that he would look for outside funding sources.

Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Sims, moved approval of Communication No.
240223. The motion carried.
OLD BUSINESS
Commissioner Hansen asked what is the status of the memorandum he asked for at the September 14,
2000 meeting regarding the total budget for the new Cook County Hospital.
Michael LaMont stated that he is finalizing figures with the hospital relative to the type of technology
being used that was not part of the original budget.
Commissioner Hansen asked when he should expect the memorandum?
Michael LaMont responded he will have the report shortly after the first of the year.
Commissioner Hansen asked when the committee can expect a report on the intended use of the old
Cermak Hospital?
Bruce Washington stated that he will have that report by the next construction meeting.
PROGRESS REPORT - NOVEMBER 22, 2000
Commissioner Hansen asked if the committee could receive a report in regard to the infrastructure
upgrade at the County Building?
Michael LaMont commented that the County just received a draft from the consultants which he will read
and summarize and report back to the Construction Committee.
Commissioner Hansen asked if the committee could receive a report on the meetings that the County had
with the City of Chicago in regards to the exterior renovation project?

256

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 19, 2000
Michael LaMont stated a number of meetings and discussions with the City of Chicago have been held
and the intent was to enter into an intergovernmental agreement to have one vendor complete the project.
Mr. LaMont further said the County has attempted to contact the City of Chicago but has not been
successful. Finally, Mr. LaMont stated that he would prepare a report for the commissioners.
Commissioner Hansen asked Mr. LaMont to define the term "inefficient"?
Michael LaMont said the term as stated means to put out more light and use less energy.
Commissioner Hansen asked what upgrades will be made at the Department of Corrections?
Michael LaMont commented that the project includes the locking mechanisms to the cell units and
security cameras. He said that when the word upgrade is used, it typically means the building equipment
cannot be repaired.
Commissioner Hansen asked for a memorandum regarding what elements are being upgraded.
Michael LaMont stated that he would get the memorandum to the commissioner.
Commissioner Hansen asked the number of fire escapes in the Criminal Courts Building?
Michael LaMont stated that he did not have the answer but would respond at a later date.
Commissioner Hansen asked when the project would be completed?
Michael LaMont said that the County is waiting on permits from the City of Chicago.
Commissioner Hansen asked if a permit for the day care center has been received?
Michael LaMont said two weeks ago the permit had not been received but he will check further.
Commissioner Hansen requested the amount of capital investment authorized in each of the ambulatory
care clinics.
Michael LaMont responded that he would get the figures.
Commissioner Hansen asked the status of medical records storage?
Michael LaMont stated that there are few good options as to where the records can be relocated. One
option is to store them on the first floor of the 1900 Polk Building where the kitchen and cafeteria are
currently located. Mr. LaMont further stated a consultant was hired to perform an analysis for which the
Office of Capital Planning and Policy is still waiting.
Commissioner Hansen asked for a memorandum on the problem regarding the storage of medical records.
Michael LaMont stated that he would get a memorandum to the committee.
Commissioner Hansen asked when the temporary Traffic Court is scheduled to open?
Michael LaMont responded that the scheduled date is January 16, 2001.

The Chairman then proceeded to the last item on the agenda.
Item #7 - Report on legislative activities in the General Assembly Veto Session.
The Chairman distributed backup material to the members titled "2000 Veto Session Report to the Cook
County Board", prepared by the Board's lobbyist, Morrill & Associates, P.C.. Chairman Hansen then
recognized Evan Williams, with Morrill & Associates, and asked him to give a brief report highlighting
the legislative activities in the General Assembly during the Fall Veto session.
Evan Williams first noted that Steve Morrill was out of town with his family. Mr. Williams then
continued with his report, highlighting the passage of: 1) a stadium deal for the Chicago Bears; 2) a
pension bill did not pass which codifies a contract of additional benefits for State employees negotiated
and agreed to over the Summer (stressing that none of the pension enhancements in the bill affected
public pensions of employees employed by Cook County government); and, 3) the inaction of the
General Assembly to extend the suspension of the State's share of the tax on motor fuel.
Mr. Williams then gave a brief synopsis of three bills of interest to the County: 1) SB 1382
(Silverstein/Schoenberg) - this bill was amendatorily vetoed by the Governor to establish a mandatory
minimum fine of $500, plus the actual cost incurred by a property owner or unit of local government,
under a Class 3 or 4 felony conviction of criminal defacement of property; 2) HB 113 7 (Boland/Dudycz)
- this was the bill for changes in the Election Code requested by the Chicago and Cook County Clerk's
Election Departments. It would provide for use of the new voting equipment with its voter friendly ballot
SB 747
rejection feature and electronic ballot counting software enhancements; and 3)
(Silverstein/Currie) - this bill contained language initiated by Cook County Assessor Jim Houlihan to
correct a Property Tax Appeals Board (PTAB) ruling by mandating the use of the county ordinance level
of assessment for commercial and industrial property.
Mr. Williams stated that during the veto session the Governor's recommended change to SB 1382 was
approved by both the House and Senate, HB 1137 was not acted upon, and the Assessor's office
attempted to move the language on SB 747 onto HB 3875 but failed. Mr. Williams concluded by noting
that there were two days remaining in January (Jan. 8 and 9) for possible legislative action before the 91st
General Assembly ends.

260

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 19, 2000
In response to Commissioner Daley's question regarding if the Cook County Clerk's recommended
language, granting the county authority to use the new election equipment was part of the amendatory
language intended for House Bill 1137, Mr. Williams confirmed that it was.
In response to Vice Chairman Lechowicz's inquiry if any legislative action on substantive bills was going
to occur during the last two days of the veto session, Mr. Williams stated that no newly introduced bills
would be acted on, but bills positioned on the calendar for second reading may be taken up in the last two
days of the session.
In response to Vice Chairman Lechowicz's question regarding the status of any pension bill including
provisions impacting Cook County employees, Evan Williams stated that there were numerous pension
proposals that were introduced over the two year session of the 91 st General Assembly. However, he
stated he was not aware of any such pension bill.
In response to Vice Chairman Lechowicz's request for additional pension information, Sandra Overberg
stated that all public pension bills are referred to the Pension Laws Commission. Ms. Overberg explained
that the Commission reviews all proposals and requests letters from the Chief Executive (Governor,
Mayors, County Board Presidents, School Board Presidents, etc.) and the various Pension Boards
concerning fiscal impacts to their respective budgets or public pension funds prior to approval. In
conclusion, Ms. Overberg confirmed that all pension bills impacting Cook County had been reviewed by
the County's Pension Board and the Administration to ensure that none approved by the Pension Laws
Commission will have any fiscal impact on the County's levy or budget.
In response to Chairman Hansen's question concerning whether the proposed language of Election bill
HB 1137 grants both the City's and the County's Board of Elections necessary authority to use the new
election equipment, Evan Williams stated that this language is included in the bill, but additional election
provisions were added that would allow DuPage County to study and use electronic voting equipment,
and this stalled the bill. Vice Chairman Lechowicz suggested that the members contact the sponsors of
House Bill 1137 and ask that the original language be reconsidered separately from any other election
proposals and adopted immediately.
Commissioner Daley asked if the county could proceed without legislative authority to test and use the
equipment in its intended manner during the upcoming April elections, since there will be no statewide
races involved at that time. Chairman Hansen stated he would contact the Clerk's Election Department on
Commissioner Daley's question and get back to the members with their response.
Chairman Hansen stated his concern relating to the lack of action on HB 117 6 and noted that the Board
passed a Resolution on December 5, 2000, which encourages the passage of legislation. The Chairman
stated he would like to call an informal meeting of the members, along with the County's two contract
lobbyists (Steve Morrill and Gene Barnes) and the County's election authorities for discussion of the
election bill. He stated he would contact those individuals on the issue, focusing on how best to proceed
to ensure passage of legislation.

Commissioner Daley moved to adjourn the meeting, seconded by Commissioner Silvestri. The
motion carried and the meeting was adjourned.

Re:

Resolution oflntention to Issue Industrial Revenue Bonds (IRB) for Little Lady Foods, Inc.

Transmitting this Resolution of Intention to issue an IRB and authorizing the execution of the
Memorandum of Agreement.
Little Lady Foods, Inc. wishes to finance the acquisition, rehabilitation and equipping of a manufacturing
facility to produce food products and to refund prior bonds. The tax-exempt bond amount is not to
exceed $5,550,000.00. The County will allocate an amount not to exceed $3,000,000.00 from its 2001
bond cap authority and the remainder of $2.55 million will be a refunding of the 1997 bond issue (no
additional cap is required for this refunding).
The Cook County Economic Development Advisory Committee has reviewed the application of Little
Lady Foods, Inc. and submits its report and resolution recommending approval. The Chief Financial
Officer concurs with this recommendation.
The Resolution of Intention to issue is required before final approval of the bond ordinance in order to
reserve the bond cap and to allow time for the public hearing Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of
1982 (TEFRA) on the bonds. The bond ordinance is expected to be introduced in 2001, authorizing the
use of 2001 bond cap.
