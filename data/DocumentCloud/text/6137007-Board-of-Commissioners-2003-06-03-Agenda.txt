28, 2003.

DEFERRED COMPENSATION COMMITTEE

Transmitting a Communication, dated May 22, 2003 from
JOHN F. CHAMBERS, Chainnan, Deferred Compensation Committee
The Deferred Compensation Committee respectfully requests and recommends that the County Board
approve the following:

1626

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 3, 2003
1)

Amend the current Deferred Compensation Plan for public employees in order to include
necessary and beneficial changes to the Plan now authorized by the Economic Growth
and Tax Relief Reconci liation Act of 2001 (EGTRRA) and compliance with audit
recommendations; and

2)

Extend the current Administrative Services Agreement with Nationwide for one year, to
June 30, 2004, with an option for an additional year in the event Nationwide continues to
meet the County's administrative and investment criteria.

The basis of the Committee's recommendation to extend the current agreement with Nationwide is as
follows:
A)

Significant price reduction to plan participants.

B)

A desire to maintain continuity during the early retirement period, so employees could
benefit from consistent financia l planning when early retirement was at a peak.

C)

Plan assets have fluctuated due to the volatility in the market and a reduction due to the
Early Retirement Incentive (ERl) withdrawals. Future price may depend in part on plan
asset size.

I have also submitted a list of enhancements to the existing plan and a brief summary of performance, and
a lso prior historical correspondence.

Commissioner Steele, seconded by Commissioner Maldonado, moved that the request of the Chainnan of
the Deferred Compensation Committee be approved. The motion carried.

President Stroger voted "present".
