ESTABLISH THE PARTNERS AGAINST ANIMAL CRUELTY (PAAC) TASK FORCE
AND TO PROMOTE EDUCATION WITHIN COOK COUNTY TO REDUCE AND
PREVENT ANIMAL ABUSE AND RELATED INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE
(PROPOSED RESOLUTION). Submitting a Proposed Resolution sponsored by Joan
Patricia Murphy, County Commissioner; and Co-Sponsored by John H. Stroger, Jr.,
President, Elizabeth Ann Doody Gorman and Deborah Sims, County Commissioners.
The following is a synopsis of the Proposed Reso lution.
PROPOSED RESOLUTION

A RESOLUTION TO ESTABLISH THE PARTNERS AGAINST ANIMAL CRUELTY
(PAAC) TASK FORCE AND TO PROMOTE EDUCATION WITHIN COOK
COUNTY TO REDUCE AND PREVENT ANIMAL ABUSE AND RELATED
INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE
WHEREAS, criminal profiling experts associated with the Federal Bureau of Investigation
have identified a strong correlation between animal abuse and violence against humans and
have documented crue lty to animals as one of the traits which indicates the characteristics of
a violent personality which is demonstrated by the disproportionately high number of violent
killers in the prison system, virtually every serial killer, and recent cases of school violence;
all of which have involved persons with a history of animal abuse; and
WHEREAS, the Partners Against Anima l Cruelty (PAAC) Task Force was formed in
September 2004, to coordinate a county-wide effort to abolish cruelty, neglect and violence
involving animals in order to improve the quality and safety of their lives as well as the lives
and safety of the citizens of our communities.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners
recognizes the establishment of Partners Against Animal Cruelty (PAAC), a volunteer
organization governed by the Cook County Board of Commissioners, comprised of an
advisory board of five to seven members, one appointee from each of the seventeen (17)
commissioner districts, and a representative from each of the thirty (30) townships as well as
law enforcement, animal control wardens, animal organizations, and shelters; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners:
1. Recognizes that individua ls who abuse animals are more likely to commit more serious
violent crimes against humans.
2.

Urges social workers, teachers, mental health professiona ls, and others to be aware of the
connection between animal cruelty and human violence and to evaluate carefully and to
monitor closely individuals who have a history of abusing animals since this may indicate
a propensity to commit violence against other humans.

3.

Urges appropriate local and county agencies to encourage and support research to
increase the understanding of the connection between cruelty to animals and violence
against humans in order to utilize instances of animal abuse to identify and intervene with
potentially violent individuals and to assist in identifying and protecting children at risk
of abuse and neglect.

3510

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 1, 2005

4. Urges agencies which are undertaking research on violent crime and its causes to
incorporate examination of the link between violence against animals and vio lence
against humans.
5. Urges local law enforcement officials, particularly prosecutors and judges, to treat cases
of animal cruelty seriously both because such cruelty is a reliable indicator of the
potential for domestic violence and other fonns of violence against humans.
6.

Commends the fine work of local animal control official s and humane investigators who
help enforce laws against animal abuse and urges these profess ionals to work more
closely with local law enforcement personnel to identify and prevent potential violence
against humans.

*Referred to the Public Health Subcommittee on 06/21105.

WHEREAS, Almighty God in His infinite wisdom has called Rosa Parks, the widely-acknowledged
" mother" of America 's civil rights movement, from our midst; and
WHEREAS, Rosa Parks made history on the first day of December in 1955 when, after a long, tiring day
of work, she refused to give up her seat on a Montgomery, Alabama bus to a white person; and
WHEREAS, that singular act of defiance, coupled with her subsequent arrest, sparked a boycott of the
Montgomery bus system that lasted nearly a year, and simultaneously grew into the civil rights movement
which ultimately resulted in the repeal of racist Jim Crow laws in the South; and
WHEREAS, Rosa Parks wasn't attempting to start a movement at the time of the incident. " I didn' t get
on the bus to get arrested," she has said. " I got on the bus to go home," she added; and
WHEREAS, interestingly enough, Parks was not the first person to get arrested for refusing to relinquish
their seat; she, however happened to have all the characteristics that would make her a perfect icon to help
spark the creation of a movement. Being married, gainfully employed and an overall " upstanding"
citizen, Rosa Parks was above moral reproach and would be able to withstand intense media scrutiny to
follow; and
WHEREAS, had Rosa Parks simply vacated her seat, the role Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
played in the civil rights movement could have been entirely different, with no Civil Rights Act of 1964
or Voting Rights Act of 1965; and
WHEREAS, Rosa Parks' actions should serve as a testament to the fact that each and every one of us has
the innate ability to make a positive difference in our world; and
WHEREAS, the varied opportunities that African Americans currently enjoy in this country can be
traced to Rosa Parks and her singular courageous act; and

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 1, 2005

WHEREAS, with the passing of Rosa Parks, we have lost one of the true catalysts and galvanizing forces
behind America's civil rights movement. Despite her slight build and diminutive nature, Mrs. Parks
simple and understated act of defiance spearheaded a series of events that changed the course of
American history for the better, relative to the treatment of African Americans and other minorities.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners, on behalf
of the more than five million residents of Cook County, does hereby express its deepest condolences and
most heartfelt sympathy to the family as well as the many friends, loved ones and admirers of Rosa Parks;
and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a suitable copy of this Resolution be promulgated through the
public record so that the rich legacy of Rosa Parks may be so honored and ever cherished.

Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Hansen , moved to suspend the rules so that this
matter may be considered. The motion carried unanimously.
Commissioner Steele, seconded by Commissioner Murphy, moved that the Resolution be approved and
adopted. President Pro Tempore Moreno called for a rising vote. T he motion carried unanimously.

PUBLIC TESTIMONY
Pursuant to Rule 4-30, George Blakemore, addressed the President and Members of the Cook County
Board of Commissioners. Mr. Blakemore spoke concerning several issues regarding Cook County.

ADJOURNMENT
Commissioner Peraica, seconded by Commissioner Silvestri, moved that the meeting do now adjourn to
meet again at the same time and same place on Tuesday, November 15, 2005, in accordance with County
Board Resolution 04-R-428.
The motion prevailed and the meeting stood adjourned.
