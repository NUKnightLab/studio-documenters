COMMISSIONERS
PROPOSED ORDINANCES
Transmitting a Communication, dated August 18, 2006 from
ROBERTO MALDONADO, County Commissioner
I am submitting the following ordinance entitled, " Affirmative Action/Equal Employment Opportunity
Ordinance," for the Main Agenda of the September 7, 2006 Cook County Board meeting. I will request
that this item be referred to the Committee on Finance for further review and discussion.
Both a preliminary statistical analysis known as the "Cook County Employee Diversity Representation
Report," and a subsequent four year retroactive analysis of the County's work force (submitted for your
review), demonstrate a striking disparity in minority hiring among many of Cook County's public offices.
In an effort to rectify this imbalance in our public work force, I believe it is necessary to codify the "Cook
County Equal Employment Opportunity Plan," the affirmative action policy and procedure of the County.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 7, 2006

WHEREAS, the Equal Employment Opportunity Coordinating Council ' s Policy Statement on
Affirmative Action, 41 C.F.R. § 60-3.17, notes in pertinent part: "On the one hand, vigorous enforcement
of the laws against discrimination is essential. But equally, and perhaps even more important are
affinnative voluntary efforts on the part of public employers to assure that positions in the public service
are genuinely and equally accessible to qualified persons, without regard to their sex, racial, or ethnic
characteristics. Without such efforts equal employment is no more than a wish;" and
WHEREAS, the President of the Cook County Board of Commissioners has instituted the "Cook County
Equal Employment Opportunity Plan" for offices under the President; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners desires to codify the affirmative action policy
and procedure of the County and to give such policy and procedure the full force of the County's
lawmaking powers; and
WHEREAS, the first step in the construction of any affirmative action plan is an analysis of the
employer's work force to determine whether percentages of persons within race, ethnic, gender, or sexual
orientation groups in individual job classifications are substantially similar to the percentages persons
within those groups who are available in the relevant job market and who possess the basic job-related
qualifications; and
WHEREAS, when substantial disparities are found, the next step is to examine each element of the
overall selection process to identify elements which operate to exclude persons on the basis of race,
ethnicity, gender, or sexual orientation; and
WHEREAS, both a preliminary statistical analysis known as the "Cook County Employee Diversity
Representation Report," and a subsequent four year retroactive analysis of the County' s work force,
substantiate a striking disparity in minority hiring among many of Cook County' s public offices.

PROPOSED ORDINANCE

TAX INCREMENT FINANCE DISTRICT DISCLOSURE ORDINANCE
WHEREAS, a total of $686 million in property tax revenue was captured by tax increment finance (TIF)
districts in Cook County in 2005; and
WHEREAS, keeping the growth in property value in TIF districts off the tax rolls effectively narrows the
tax base and forces tax rates to be higher than they would otherwise need to be to generate the same levy
amounts; and
WHEREAS, Cook County tax bills identify those properties located in TIF districts, but do not indicate
how much in taxes from each property is distributed to the TIF district; and
WHEREAS, some parcels, including 77 West Wacker Drive in Chicago, the future headquarters of
United Airlines, pay I 00 percent of their property taxes to the TIF district in which they are located, even
though the amounts shown on the tax bill suggest that taxing districts such as the County and Forest
Preserve District are receiving the revenue; and
WHEREAS, Cook County taxpayers deserve an accurate accounting of the distribution of their tax
dollars.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that:
The County Clerk shall determine whether a property is located in a tax increment finance (TIF) district,
and, if so, shall determine the name of the TIF district in which the property is located.
For each property located within a TIF district, the County Clerk shall calculate the amount of tax
distributed to the taxing districts and to the TIF district. The County Clerk shall furnish these findings to
the County Treasurer for use in preparing the second-installment property tax bills of affected properties.

24

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 7, 2006

The County Treasurer shall clearly indicate on second-installment property tax bills whether a property is
located within a TIF district, and, if so, shall identify the TIF district by name.
On the second-installment property tax bill of each property located within a TIP district, the County
Treasurer shall show the amount of tax distributed to the taxing districts and to the TIF district.
This Ordinance shall take effect on December 31, 2007.

Commissioner Moreno, seconded by Commissioner Silvestri, moved to suspend the rules so that this
matter may be considered. The motion carried unanimously.

AMENDMENT TO THE
REAL PROPERTY ASSESSMENT CLASSIFICATION ORDINANCE
BE IT ORDAINED by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that the Real Property Assessment
Classification Ordinance 06-0-09 (previously approved and adopted February 15, 2006), Section 2 is
hereby amended to read as follows:
Section 2.
Real estate is divided into the following assessment classes:
Class 6b:

Real estate used primarily for industrial purposes, as defined herein, consisting of all
newly constructed buildings or other structures, including the land upon which they are
situated; or abandoned property, as defined herein, including the land upon which such
property is situated; or alJ buildings and other structures which are substantially
rehabilitated to the extent such rehabilitation has added to their value, including qualified
land related to the rehabilitation. Land qualifies when the rehabilitation adds vertical or
horizontal square footage to the improvements. The amount of land eligible for the
incentive shall be in such proportion as the square footage added by the rehabilitation
bears to the total square footage of the improvements on the parcel.

25

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 7, 2006

An applicant must obtain from the municipality in which the real estate is located or the
Board of Commissioners of Cook County if the real estate is located in an unincorporated
area, an ordinance or resolution expressly stating that the municipality or County Board,
as the case may be, has detennined that the incentive provided by Class 6b is necessary
for development to occur on that specific real estate and that the municipality or County
Board, as the case may be, supports and consents to the Class 6b application to the
Assessor. A certified copy of the ordinance or resolution need not be filed at the time of
filing the Class 6b eligibility application with the Assessor, but must be filed with the
Assessor no later than the date an assessment appeal is filed to request the class change to
Class 6b. If the resolution is not filed at the time of the eligibility application, the
applicant shall instead file, at that time, a letter from the municipality or the County, as
the case may be, confinning that a resolution or ordinance supporting the incentive has
been requested.
A copy of the resolution or letter confirming that a resolution has been requested,
whichever is filed with the application, will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the
Secretary of the Cook County Board for distribution to the Commissioners from the
affected districts.
In the case of abandoned property, if the municipality or the Board of Commissioners, as the
case may be, finds that special circumstances justify finding that the property is "abandoned"
for purpose of Class 6b, even though it has been vacant and unused for less than 24 months,
that finding, along with the specification of the circumstances, shall be included in the
resolution or ordinance supporting and consenting to the Class 6b application. Such
resolution or ordinance shall be included with the eligibility application. If the ordinance or
resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the Board of Commissioners of Cook
County is required to validate such shortened period of qualifying abandonment, and a
resolution to that effect shall be included with the Class 6b eligibility application. The
applicant must obtain the municipal enabling ordinance with the required finding of special
circumstances and present such municipal ordinance to the Board of Commissioners of
Cook County prior to its determination as to whether it will validate such a shortened period
of qualifying abandonment and provide a County resolution to that effect. A certified copy
of an ordinance or resolution finding that special circumstances exist, as well as a certified
copy of a County ordinance or resolution validating the shortened period of qualifying
abandonment need not be filed at the time of filing the Class 6b eligibility application with
the Assessor, but must be filed with the Assessor no later than the date an assessment appeal
is filed to request the class change to Class 6b. If the resolution is not filed at the time of the
eligibility application, the applicant shall instead file, at that time, a letter from the
municipality or the County as the case may be, confinning that a resolution or ordinance
regarding special circumstances has been requested.
This classification shall continue for a period of twelve years from the date such new
construction (excluding demolition, if any) or such substantial rehabilitation was
completed and initially assessed, or in the case of abandoned property, from the date of
substantial reoccupancy. This incentive may be renewed during the last year a property
is entitled to a 16% assessment level, if the following requirements are met:
1.

the taxpayer notifies the Assessor's Office of his intent to request renewal of the
incentive from the municipality, or the Board of Commissioners of Cook County if
the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, and;

26

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 7, 2006

2. the municipality in which the real estate is located or the Board of Commissioners of
Cook County, if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, adopts a
resolution expressly stating that the municipality or County Board, as the case may
be, has detennined that the industrial use of the property is necessary and beneficial
to the local economy, and supports and consents to renewal of the Class 6b and;

3. a copy of that resolution and a completed renewal application are filed with the
Office of the Assessor before the expiration of the 16% assessment level period.
The number of renewal periods is not limited as long as the property continues to apply
and qualify for Class 6b. Any property which applies for Class 6b treatment on or before
the adoption date of this ordinance change will be eligible for this renewal tenn at the end
of their original incentive period subject to the above requirements.
If, on the effective date of this Ordinance, a property is receiving Class 6b treatment, but
the assessment level is higher than 16%, that taxpayer may apply for renewal as outlined
above and receive a 16% assessment level for the prescribed period beginning after the
filing and approval of the resolution and renewal application. However, if, as of that
effective date, the tax payer's assessment is higher than 16% and the taxpayer is granted a
renewal of the incentive for subsequent years, no reduction of the current assessment level
based on renewal of the incentive will be granted.
The notice of intent to request renewal which is filed with the Assessor's Office will be
forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the secretary of the Cook County Board for
distribution to Commissioners from the effected districts.
If no renewal is obtained, the incentive shall be phased out over the next two years,
pursuant to Section 3 below. After expiration of the last incentive period, the real estate
shall revert to the applicable classification under this Ordinance.
Additionally, for newly constructed or substantially rehabilitated buildings and other
structures to qualify for Class 6b classification, an eligibility application must be made to
the Assessor within one year prior to the commencement of such new construction or
substantial rehabilitation. With respect to abandoned property, the eligibility application
must be made to the Assessor no later than ninety days after purchase for value if such
property is encompassed within the definition herein of abandoned property by reason of
purchase for value; or within one year prior to the commencement of substantial
rehabilitation if such property is encompassed within that definition by reason of
substantial rehabilitation.
The Assessor may adopt rules consistent with the foregoing necessary to ensure proper
review of all factors relevant to determine eligibility for the benefits provided under Class
6b.
The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports by all
Class 6b recipients as to the use of the property and the number of persons employed at
the Class 6b site. Such reports shall be verified. Failure to file such reports within the
time established by the Assessor's rules shall result in loss of the incentive for the period
relating to the non-filing.
A Class 6b eligibility application for the occupation of abandoned property without proof
of purchase is allowed if the following conditions are met:

27

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, Cook County government is currently facing a serious budget crisis, with a projected
shortfall approaching $56 million and the FY2007 budget process looming on the horizon; and
WHEREAS, Cook County government is making concerted efforts to reduce the budgetary deficit by
eliminating duplicity in various government functions through consolidation, increasing revenue
collection efforts, and improving efficiencies through technological upgrades, among other measures; and
WHEREAS, the many departments that make up the government of Cook County are or may need to cut
jobs; and
WHEREAS, further undesirable cuts in jobs and core services may also result from an unresolved budget
deficit; and
WHEREAS, in the interest of Cook County Government, the employees of the government and the
citizens of the County, it is the desire of this government to consider all ideas to help resolve this crisis
and balance the budget, which is required by state law; and
WHEREAS, it has been consistently shown that empowering all employees of an organization, be it in
the private or public sector, to participate in employee suggestion programs has yielded tangible results
through generation of ideas for cost saving measures, improved efficiency, process improvements,
identification of new revenue streams and elimination of wasteful spending; and
WHEREAS, meritorious ideas know no boundaries and can be produced by any level of employee in an
organization; and
WHEREAS, active engagement by employees gives an organization a competitive advantage and is
instrumental to its success.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners does
hereby request the formation of an employee suggestion program enabling all Cook County employees to
participate in generating and submitting ideas with the explicit goal of reducing expenditures, improving
efficiencies and effectiveness, increasing revenue, and eliminating wasteful spending in an effort to close
the budget shortfall for FY2006 and present and ratify a balanced budget for FY2007.

WHEREAS, Cook County government is charged with presenting a balanced budget each fiscal year, as
mandated by the Illinois Constitution; and
WHEREAS, the budget process and the budget itself should be transparent so as to allow for proper
scrutiny by the public, whose tax dollars help fund it; and
WHEREAS, a transparent budget allows the Cook County Board of Commissioners to also properly
scrutinize and adjust it if necessary, through the amendment process, to help identify and eliminate
wasteful spending, as well as improve efficiencies; and
WHEREAS, Cook County government has an approximately $3 billion budget and allocates portions of
it to fund independent organizations, either directly or through one of its various departments; and
WHEREAS, currently these allocations appear simply as a line item in the annual appropriation bill or
not at all if funded by a governmental department; and
WHEREAS, it is this government' s obligation to ensure that monies are spent judiciously by funding
programs that have the highest return on investment via cost savings to the County and benefits to its
citizens; and
WHEREAS, it is difficult, if not impossible, to properly analyze the value of the return on investment of
these various organizations from a line item budget entry; and
WHEREAS, in order to determine which programs are effective and financially sound and worthy of
continued funding, it is necessary to have a tool documenting its effectiveness and cost savings.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners, does
hereby request that any organization funded wholly or in part by the government of Cook County directly
or via one of its departments present an annual financial and impact report to this Honorable Body, so as
to properly document the associated cost savings, economic impact and effectiveness of the County
funded programs provided by these organizations.

proactively search for ways in which to accomplish these necessary financial goals; and
WHEREAS, undesirable cuts in core services may result from continued budgetary problems now and in
the future; and
WHEREAS, it is our fiduciary responsibility as elected officials, to constantly look for new and
innovative ways to save taxpayers' money, while still providing "best in class" services, for which Cook
County has become known; and
WHEREAS, it has been shown that in the domain of Information Technology that reliance on
mainframes is increasingly a costly and less flexible option for governments; and
WHEREAS, in light of this reality, more and more governments have looked and opted for new, more
efficient and less costly computer platforms to run their programs; and
WHEREAS, as a result, only 4 counties in Illinois other than Cook County currently use mainframe
computer platforms, and only about 88 in the entire nation; and
WHEREAS, reduced reliance on a mainframe, by migrating to an alternative IBM computer platform
that will run Legacy Cobol applications, would eliminate the need for costly upgrades and continued
leasing of the County's current mainframe; and
WHEREAS, using FY2005 data, the current three year lease for the County mainframe is $11.7 million
and migrating to an IBM alternative platfonn, such as iSeries or pSeries, would have a one-time cost of
approximately $1.5 million; and
WHEREAS, if implemented before the end of FY2007, a potential cost savings of at least $15 million
could be realized by the end of FY2010.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners, does
hereby request an analysis of the current County IBM mainframe to compare it with alternative IBM
platfonns that exist on the market today for the express purpose of determining whether or not we are
taking advantage of the best technology available at the least cost to Cook County.

Commissioner Moreno, seconded by Commissioner Silvestri, moved to suspend the rules so that this
matter may be considered. The motion carried unanimously.
Commissioner Moreno, seconded by Commissioner Silvestri, moved that the Proposed Resolution be

WHEREAS, Cook County government is assigned the challenging job of managing the County's public
health services, which is the second largest public health system in the nation; and
WHEREAS, this system serves as a safety net for our residents who are unable to afford private
healthcare; and
WHEREAS, it is the responsibility of the government of Cook County to ensure that companies
contracting with the County's Bureau of Health Services honor the tenns of their contracts both for the
duration of the initial contract and for any extensions that may have been granted; and
WHEREAS, if there is the possibility that the tenns of a contract, such as price or services, and/or
subsequent extensions to said contract have not been honored, it is incumbent upon this Honorable Body
to conduct an audit to verify that no irregularities have occurred; and
WHEREAS, McKesson Phannaceutical received numerous extensions, starting at the end of the original
contract on June 30, 2005 through July 31, 2006, costing taxpayers millions of dollars for each extension,
which has raised questions as to whether the terms of the original contract, for example but not limited to,
actual amount spent compared to prices quoted and one day turnarounds for emergency ordering without
backordering, were being honored during these extensions; and
WHEREAS, an audit is necessary to assure that taxpayers' money is safeguarded and was not being used
improperly and that this government is doing everything in its power to deliver quality service in the most
efficient and cost effective manner possible, without the specter of impropriety.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners, does
hereby request a full audit be conducted of McKesson Pharmaceutical for the three year period of the
original contract, as well as all extensions to said contract to detennine if the conditions of the original

WHEREAS, Cook County government is currently working diligently to shore up the current shortfall in
the FY2006 budget; and

that can be exploited to ameliorate the County ' s financial situation; and
WHEREAS, Medicare has a number of claims, which are paid incorrectly, as much as 2%, most of
which are underpayments; and
WHEREAS, because these errors occur infrequently the majority of hospitals are unaware of them; and
WHEREAS, these errors can result from incorrect billing by the hospital, as well as incorrect payments
by the intennediary; and
WHEREAS, due to the complexity of Medicare's Outpatient Claims Review, CMS (Centers for
Medicare & Medicaid Services) is also prone to errors, some of which go undetected; and
WHEREAS, all of these claims can be resubmitted to obtain the correct payment; and
WHEREAS, an opportunity exists to audit previously paid Medical Part A claims to recover monies for
the County that were mistakenly remitted by the Fiscal Intennediary; and
WHEREAS, this opportunity is time sensitive due to Medicare' s timely filing deadline of December 31,
2006;and
WHEREAS, because of these filing deadlines, it is imperative that this Board acts expeditiously to
ensure that these monies are recovered; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Bureau of Health Services may lack the expertise and resources to
undertake such an endeavor; and
WHEREAS, Nebo Systems, Inc., currently under contract with Cook County to provide Retroactive
Claims Reprocessing, has successfully partnered with Vaughn Holland Consulting on similar projects and
are experts in this field .
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners, does
hereby request Nebo Systems, Inc. be awarded a temporary sole source contract until December 31, 2006
for the recovery of monies from incorrectly paid Medicare claims; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that this process be accomplished promptly, so as not to miss the filing
deadlines and consequently lose this revenue opportunity.

WHEREAS, the Shakman consent decree was approved by the United States District Court in 1994; and
WHEREAS, this federal court order forbids the City of Chicago, the County of Cook, and other local
governments from hiring or firing individuals for non-exempt positions based on political considerations;
and
WHEREAS, in recent months it has become abundantly clear that the County of Cook has failed to
comply with the Shakman consent decree; and

six-month period; and
WHEREAS, there have been revelations of politically connected persons receiving high paying County

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, the County of Cook is a home rule unit of local government pursuant to Article VII, Section
6(a) of the 1970 Illinois Constitution; and

42

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 7, 2006

WHEREAS, pursuant to its home rule power, the County of Cook may exercise any power and perfonn
any function relating to its government and affairs including the power to regulate for the protection of
the public health, safety, morals, and welfare; and
WHEREAS, to this end, the County of Cook is dedicated to providing all of its residents with equal
access to the services, opportunities, and protection county government has been established to
administer; and
WHEREAS, there are now approximately 12 million undocumented immigrants in the United States,
including half a million in Illinois and more than 300,000 in Cook County, who have been systematically
denied the opportunity enjoyed by past generations of immigrants to become legal permanent residents or
citizens of this country; and
WHEREAS, prior to 1918, the tenn " illegal immigrant" had no meaning since the United States did not
even require passports and the Mexican-U.S. border was unguarded and passed freely; and
WHEREAS, when Congress passed the National Origins Act in 1924, it began its restrictive immigration
policy, placing strict quotas on the numbers of Italians, Irish, Gennans, Jews, Japanese, and other
ethnicities, who were considered inferior by many white Protestant Americans; and
WHEREAS, in 1965, Congress repealed the National Origins Act and established a new system of
immigration restricting the number of new arrivals, but making it illegal to discriminate against applicants
because of their birthplace, race or ethnicity; and
WHEREAS, over the past two decades, immigration policy has become even more restncttve and
punitive and closed off avenues previously available for immigrants to obtain legal permanent residency,
while the U.S.-Mexico border has been further militarized; and
WHEREAS, current U.S. immigration policy does not reflect our democratic values of what is just,
humane and moral and as the current debate on comprehensive immigration reform comes to a halt, the
urgency to find real, workable solutions to modernize our archaic immigration laws becomes desperately
apparent; and
WHEREAS, the migration experience has adverse emotional and psychological effects on families,
especially those who have U.S. citizen families, including children and/or spouses, and are forced to
separate for many years due to unjust immigration policies and backlogs in visa applications; and
WHEREAS, raids carried out by the federal government, ranging from the highly publicized nationwide
workplace raids on April 17, 2006 that resulted in the arrest of I, 187 employees to the less widely known
sweeps of homes, have instilled fear and panic in immigrant communities, encouraged intimidation,
harassment and racial profiling, and led to the separation of many from their U.S. citizen families ; and
WHEREAS, one of these families recently gained national attention, when an undocumented mother,
Elvira Arellano, defied a deportation order from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and
sought sanctuary in the Adalberto United Methodist Church in Chicago with her U.S. citizen son; and
WHEREAS, although the plight of Elvira and her son is the plight of millions of undocumented
immigrants with U.S. citizen families , her fate is a test case that will either set our nation on the
progressive path of real , humane, immigration reform or the regressive path of fear, repression and
intimidation; and

43

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 7, 2006
WHEREAS, according to a recent study on undocumented immigrants conducted by the University of
Illinois at Chicago's Center for Urban Economic Development, undocumented workers contribute much
more to the U.S. economy than they receive: the majority work full-time; 70% pay taxes; the majority
don' t collect tax refunds they have earned; 220,000 currently employed in Chicago contribute $5.35
billion annually to the area economy as a result of their local consumer spending; and they make far less
use of available social services than any other group; and
WHEREAS, Douglas S. Massey, a Princeton University professor and author of " Beyond Smoke and
Mirrors: Mexican Immigration in an Era of Economic Integration," further supports these statistics,
stating that in 2004 alone, undocumented workers contributed $7 billion to Social Security and $1.5
billion to Medicare with the knowledge that they would have no claim to future collection; and
WHEREAS, despite these statistics, there is a growing sentiment of hatred and intimidation of
undocumented immigrants, feelings reminiscent of nearly every historical wave of migration into the U.S.
40% of the first massive wave of immigrants that came to America between I 8 I 5 and I 860 were escaping
starvation in Ireland, but were derided as stupid, lazy and dirty, despite the fact they cleaned houses and
cared for the children of the rich and toiled in dangerous mines and filthy sweatshops; and
WHEREAS, Cook County is a leader in the movement for the protection of civil rights for
undocumented immigrants and the Cook County Board has officially urged Congress to pass fair and
humane laws that will reform our broken immigration system.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the County of Cook be declared "A Sanctuary
County," a county that defends the basic human rights and dignity of undocumented immigrants and our
democratic principles of life, liberty, and justice, and all those who, as Emma Lazarus wrote in her
famous sonnet that now is engraved on a plaque at the Statue of Liberty, are "tired ... poor ... [and] ... yearn
to breathe free . .. " and recognizes that much of the historical and moral tradition of our nation is rooted in
the provision of sanctuary to those seeking a safe haven from oppression; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the County of Cook supports the humanitarian efforts of Reverend
Walter Coleman, who, in good faith, has opened the doors of the Adalberto United Methodist Church in
Cook County to provide sanctuary to Elvira Arellano and her U.S. citizen son and who are prepared to
accept the penalty for this act of civil disobedience in the hope that this violation of current immigration
law will lead to comprehensive immigration refonn that respects the rights of immigrants as families,
workers, and human beings; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the County of Cook stands in solidarity with local governments
across the nation who have declared themselves "Sanctuaries" upholding the basic human rights of
immigrants, including the cities of San Francisco, Maywood, Huntington Park and Coachella in
California and the City of Cambridge in Massachusetts; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the County of Cook joins several major cities, including Chicago,
Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Minneapolis, Saint Paul, and others who have official policies
prohibiting their municipal agencies from inquiring about immigration status and unilaterally enforcing
immigration law provisions, and hereby requires that no Cook County employee or department, to the
extent legally possible, will request information about or otherwise assist in the investigation of the
citizenship status of any County resident, will disseminate information regarding the citizenship of a
County resident, or condition the provision of County of Cook services or benefits on matters related to
citizenship; and

44

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 7, 2006

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that requiring, or promoting, local enforcement of immigration laws
gives rise to an increased threat of immigrant and minority profiling and harassment and, therefore, it is
the policy of the Cook County Sheriffs Office not to become involved in the enforcement of federal civil
immigration laws to the extent legally possible; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the U.S.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement be called upon to issue a moratorium on raids until the U.S.
Congress comes to an agreement on comprehensive immigration refonn so that the debate can be carried
out in good faith, rather than against a backdrop of fear, repression and intimidation; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the County of Cook rejects the use of the word " illegal" to
describe human beings and the use of the word "aliens" to describe immigrants, which has a
dehumanizing effect and helps justify policies that seek to criminalize and exclude immigrants, and
hereby adopts the language " undocumented" when referring to those who do not have federally
recognized resident status and "immigrant" to refer to those who have migrated to the U.S. from another
country; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners reaffirms its official
support earlier this year of private bill HR 3856, the Family Unity Act, which protects 35 Illinois families
from being tom apart by our broken immigration laws, and reaffirms its official support in 2005 of "The
Secure America Act" which allows families to be reunited more quickly through the family immigration
system; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a copy of this Resolution be submitted to the Illinois
Congressional delegation and to President George Bush on behalf of the entire Cook County Board.

Commissioner Moreno, seconded by Commissioner Silvestri, moved to suspend the rules so that this
matter may be considered. The motion carried unanimously.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 7, 2006

Reason:

The Patient Medication Assistance Services Program began in mid-2002, and has been
conducted to date by McKesson Medication Management, one of the few finns in the industry
that provides these services. McKesson Medication Management provides these services
pursuant to a subcontract with McKesson Corporation under the subject contract.
While the County has identified, through the competitive bid process, a new prime vendor, a
contractor has yet to be identified to continue the Patient Medication Assistance Program
Services currently provided by McKesson Medication Management. A bid was issued for
these Patient Medication Assistance Program Services, but it has recently been detennined
that it will be recommended that the Patient Medication Assistance Program contract be rebid
with revised specifications.
Since McKesson Medication Management currently has infrastructure and trained staff in
place to provide these Medication Assistance Services, and since a service gap will occur if
the current contract with McKesson expires as to these services without a transition to a
replacement contract, it is recommended the County extend Contract No. 02-43-960, only as it
pertains to the Medication Assistance Program Services, for a period of four (4) months. This
extension will pennit the Bureau to work with the Purchasing Agent to rebid the Patient
Medication Assistance Services contract, with revised specifications.

DEPARTMENT OF RISK MANAGEMENT
PROPOSED CONTRACT AMENDMENT
Transmitting a Communication, dated August I 6, 2006 from
JOHN L. HIBBETT, Director, Department of Risk Management
requesting to amend prior authorization to enter into a contract with Advent Medical Management,
Chicago, Illinois, Risk Management Solutions of America, Chicago, Illinois and Spectrum Health
Services, Inc., Bolingbrook, Illinois, which was Board approved on December 14, 2004 as Item Number
34, to provide an integrated Workers' Compensation case management program designed to contain costs
and accelerate the return to work process for injured employees on a pilot program basis. The contract
establishes a pilot program to achieve savings and improved service in administering workers'
compensation claims.
The original Board letter provided for a contract amount of$ I 35,000.00, reflecting only certain start-up
costs and an annual charge for the two-year operation of a "call center" by Ri sk Management Solutions of
America, where the initial intake of claimant infonnation is obtained. While the program was also
intended to include the perfonnance of certain case investigation services, case management services and
bill review services by Spectrum Health Services and Advent Medical Management, the original Board
authorization did not clarify the respective services to be provided by each finn . In addition, it did not
include the basis for payment of these finns because the amounts payable for these services are billed
directly to the applicable case file paid from the (542-845 Account) Self Insurance Fund, Self Insurance
Settlements and Worker' s Compensation. Pay ments from this account are typically smaller amounts
which are not required to be presented to the Board and are routinely made as part of the administration of
workers' compensation benefits. However, in working on this contract, the State's Attorney requested
that we amend the contract authorization to detail the basis for payment of these case-by case services and
to allocate the services to be provided by contractor so that the contract better matches the Board's
authorization.
The amounts payable to Advent Medical Management for bill review services are $7 .50 per bill reviewed
by Advent, plus a percentage of savings ranging from 18% - 25% of the amount by which charges are
reduced. The estimated cumulative amount that could be payable from actual savings to Advent Medical
Management over the tenn of the contract is $625,000.00.
Amounts payable to Risk Management Services of America, Inc. for case investigation services, which
are in addition to call center services, are based on a rate of $25 per witness interview or statement on
claims investigated on the basis of pre-approved criteria up to a maximum of $75.00 (three contracts,

Finally, case management services provided by Spectrum Health Services, Inc., which are the more
specialized services in this program, are provided at the rate of $85.00 per hour for cases that were open
prior to the agreement and at a per file rate of $250.00 for the first 30 days after a matter is opened and
$175.00 for every 30 days of management thereafter. These services are also provided only if preapproved criteria are met. The intention is that they ultimately result in a reduction of the County's
payment obligations under its workers compensation program. The estimated cumulative amount which
could be payable to Spectrum Health Services, Inc. for these services is $60,000.00.
The cumulative amount payable for these services, in addition to the $135,000.00 previously referenced
for the call center operations, will be approximately $295,000.00 in Year 1 and $410,000.00 in Year 2.
As noted above, these amounts will be paid in small increments associated with individual case files . The
actual amount payable may be less, depending upon the actual usage of the services offered.
The pilot program, to date, has resulted in savings to the County of $1,418,910.98. It is the intent of the
Department of Risk Management to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to ensure the continued
competitiveness of the costs associated with the program.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: $840,000.00. (Year 1: $135,000.00 - $295,000.00 for start up cost; Year 2:
$410,000.00 total annual call center fee). Contract period: February 1, 2005 through January 31, 2007.

REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON CONTRACT COMPLIANCE

July 13, 2006
The Honorable,
The Board of Commissioners of Cook County
ATTENDANCE

Present:

Chairman Steele, Commissioners Maldonado, Moreno and Peraica (4)

Absent:

Vice Chairman Silvestri and Commissioners Goslin and Butler (3)

Also Present:

Commissioner Collins (I); Betty Hancock Perry - Contract Compliance Administrator,
Office of Contract Compliance; Colette Holt - Attorney at Law and MBE/WBE
Consultant; and Michael Prinzi - Division Chief, Transactions, Municipal Litigation &
Real Estate Taxation Division, States Attorney's Office

Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Committee on Contract Compliance of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County met for
infonnational purposes only pursuant to notice on Thursday, July 13, 2006, at the hour of 10:00 A.M., in
the Board Room, Room 569, County Building, 11 8 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois.
Chairman Steele introduced Colette Holt, Attorney at Law and MBE/WBE Consultant. Chainnan Steele
stated that the original construction piece of the MBE/WBE Ordinance was deemed unconstitutional, and
that Ms. Holt has been working to restore constitutionality to this piece of the Ordinance.
At Chairman Steele' s request, the Secretary read the Notice into the record.
Ms. Holt delivered the following presentation concerning her report, which is entitled " Review of
Compelling Evidence of Discrimination against MBE/WBEs":
Race- and gender-conscious programs are subject to the highest level of judicial review, which is called
"strict constitutional scrutiny." The government agency bears the burden of proving that its programs are
constitutional. Racial goals cannot be calculated proportionate to the County's population. Economic
development is not seen as an adequate motive. Discrimination must be proven to be marketplace driven
or business driven, and not societal.

375

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 7, 2006
The following statistics must be compiled regarding MBE/WBEs: government utilization, availability,
disparities in the rate that regular and MBE/WBEs are fonned, and disparities regarding their experience
and access to capital. Anecdotal evidence seems to be increasingly accepted over the past several years,
however alone it does not suffice. Evidence must be shown regarding the current effects of past biases
and exclusions of the industries being studied.
A governmental program must be narrowly tailored. You must be able to prove that your program
implemented race-neutral measures. Your goals must have a solid relationship to the availability of
MBE/WBEs, and you must engage in contract-specific goal setting. Simply setting quotas will not work.
Your program must be flexible; you must be able to give waivers. If you don't, it's a quota. You must be
aware of the adverse impact on third parties; and make sure it is not too difficult to contract with the
agency. Finally, there must be some limit on the program, a regular review with a sunset date is critical.
Ms. Holt gave an overview of the cases that her report reviewed. She stated that this information would
be available as an appendix on disk to anyone who is interested.
Ms. Holt continued that in the report she reviewed the County ' s utilization of MBE/WBEs, breaking it
down into the period when the program was in effect (1993-2000) and the period since the injunction
(although the records for this period are limited). During the period of 1993 to 2000, the County had a
30% MBE and a I 0% WBE goal, and MBE/WBEs received approximately 25% of the professional
services prime consultant dollars and almost 24% of the prime construction dollars, and approximately
23% of the construction subcontractor dollars. Records are not available as to the sub-consultant
utilization.
Since the striking down of the Ordinance in 2000, the County, in compliance with the Court, has stopped
setting MBE/WBE goals; there have been drastic reductions on the construction side. However,
MBE/WBEs received 49% of the professional services prime consultant programs. MBE/WBEs received
approximately 17% of the construction contracts.
Ms. Holt continued by presenting the recommendations for an interim MBE/WBE Construction Program:
The County needs to conduct a disparity study. This study should include five years' worth of data, as
well as availability estimates, utilization analysis, disparity testing on both the County's own data and in
the private sector, and anecdotal evidence. Credit and business experience surveys should be done.
Race- and gender-neutral initiatives should be enacted. Enhanced prime contractor record keeping should
be encouraged. The County should un-bundle contracts where possible. Existing prompt payment
policies should be enforced. The County should review bonding and insurance requirements. It should
require that subcontractors receive prior approval before being substituted on the job. The County should
consider adopting: a financing and bonding program; a small business set-aside program; a mentorprotege program; a business assistance program; and a commercial non-discrimination complaint
procedure.
Regarding race- and gender-conscious remedies, Ms. Holt recommends that a personal-net-worth test and
size restrictions be required, and that the County move to contract-by-contract goal setting. There should
be a review of contract award procedures. There must be good faith efforts language in the special
conditions area of the bids document. Contracts must be monitored.
These recommendations will require additional funding. Also, the program must be integrated into the
overall County culture, not only the Contract Compliance Department, and specifically into other
departments that handle construction.

376

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 7, 2006

Ms Holt reiterated that there must be a sunset date to ensure the Courts that Cook County will continue to
gather evidence and fulfill its obligations to the Court.
Betty Hancock Perry, Contract Compliance Administrator, Office of Contract Compliance, provided the
following status report: Her Department has been working with the MIS Department and is about to
launch a test pilot to gather infonnation regarding disparity and availability among MBE/WBEs and nonminority vendors. They are waiting for Ms. Holt's approval of this test pilot. They have also worked
with the Purchasing Department and the Office of Capital Planning and Policy. They've begun to put
together a training program for the purchasing personnel of all County elected officials, including the
Assessors and Sheriff's Office. Her Department has also been working with the Procurement
Department.
Commissioner Maldonado inquired as to what the next step would be in order to achieve an interim
ordinance.
Ms. Holt stated that we could have a public hearing and then create an interim ordinance. Another option
is to simultaneously hold a public hearing and present an interim ordinance.
Commissioner Collins suggested that a resolution be passed to authorize and fund a disparity study.
Ms. Holt offered the following clarification that her report is not a substitute for a disparity study. She
recommends passing an ordinance while simultaneously conducting a disparity study within a certain
time frame and with a sunset date certain. The study will take approximately eighteen months. Ms. Holt
further stated that the County has been trying to launch a multijurisdictional disparity study, which would
save the County significant money.
Commissioner Maldonado inquired whether Chainnan Steele expects to introduce an ordinance at the
County Board meeting in September.
Chainnan Steele replied in the affirmative.
Chainnan Steele asked the Secretary to the Board to call upon the following registered public speakers.

Bureau of Information Technology and Automation; and Robert Mills - National
Practice Leader for Public Hospitals

Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Committee on Health and Hospitals of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County met pursuant
to notice on Wednesday, July 19, 2006, at the hour of 1:30 P.M. in the Board Room, Room 569, County
Building, 11 8 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois.
Chairman Butler stated that Dr. Daniel Winship, Chief, Bureau of Health Services, will make a
presentation regarding the contract with ACS Healthcare Solutions.
Dr. Winship began by acknowledging the members on the team that worked on the project.
Dr. Winship stated that at the Board Meeting of July 12, 2006, the Bureau of Health Services presented a
request for a proposal process, and through the process the Bureau of Health Services had a proposal that
they wish for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with ACS Healthcare Solutions. The process
by which the Bureau of Health Services came to this conclusion and to this point was lengthy. Dr.
Winship continued by explaining the proposal process to the Committee.
Your Committee has considered the following item and upon adoption of this report, the recommendation
is as follows:
280247

BUREAU OF HEALTH SERVICES, by Daniel H. Winship, M.D., Chief and by
Catherine Maras O' Leary, Chief lnfonnation Officer, BUREAU OF INFORMATION
TECHNOLOGY AND AUTOMATION, transmitting a Communication:
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with ACS
Healthcare Solutions, Dearborn, Michigan, for information technology (IT) services for
the Bureau of Health Services (BHS).

378

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 7, 2006

Reason:

Through a request for proposal process ACS Healthcare Solutions had the
lowest cost proposal and met all County requirements. This proposed
contract will provide staff augmentation services to meet the technology
needs of the data center, help desktop, application support, network, and
packaged rollout and application development (PRAD) towers and improve
the IT service delivery model through standardization, the creation of service
level agreements and better coordination with the County's Bureau of
Infonnation Technology and Automation. Moreover, the base cost of this
proposal minus the additional monies included for PRAD services is
approximately 42 percent lower than the current provider. ACS will
complete the installation of BHS-owned applications, including the Cemer
system, and will supplement the staff that is currently identified in this
proposal at peak times at no additional cost to the County. For the revenue
cycle, ACS will assess and remedy any issues relating to the Cemer/Siemens
interface as an additional commitment to the County. Accordingly, ACS has
met the County's MBE/WBE requirement.

$4,807, 122.00; Year 2:
Estimated Fiscal Impact:
$ 14,607, 122.00 (Year 1:
$4,850,000.00; and Year 3: $4,950,000.00). Contract period: January 1, 2007 through
December 31, ~ 2009. (897-260 Account). Requisition No. 78970014.
Approval of this item would commit Fiscal Year 2007 and future year funds.

*Referred to the Health and Hospitals Committee on 07/12/06.
Commissioner Maldonado asked if a background check was performed on semi-finalist companies.
Dr. Winship stated that the Bureau of Health Services contacted a number of the organizations that the
Bureau knew had done previous work in the past and received satisfactory comments about the
companies.
Commissioner Maldonado asked Dr. Winship if he was familiar with the "Triangle Business Journal" , a
business publication from No11h Carolina.
Dr. Winship responded that he was not familiar with the " Triangle Business Journal ," but he suggested
that maybe someone from ACS Healthcare Solutions might be familiar with the publication.
Charles Bracken, Managing Director, ACS Healthcare Solutions, responded that he is fa miliar with the
contract that Commissioner Maldonado is speaking to and that it is not part of his division. Mr. Bracken
stated that it is not part of the business that he runs; his business focuses exclusively on assisting hospitals
and health systems. Further, Mr. Bracken stated that ACS Healthcare Solutions has 55,000 employees
and that there are other parts of the business that focus on that type of work with state government.
Commissioner Maldonado stated that due to the fact that ACS Healthcare Solutions was unable to
respond to his question, at the appropriate time he will move to defer action on this contract until the
Committee receives an answer from ACS Healthcare Solutions so as to hear what happened in North
Carolina.
Dr. Winship stated that this particular organization of ACS Healthcare Solutions was not the healthcare
hospitals healthcare organization, and that is where the Bureau of Health Services has focused their
attention.

379

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 7, 2006

Commissioner Collins stated that she shared the same concerns as Commissioner Maldonado.
Commissioner Collins inquired whether ACS Healthcare Solutions is a minority-owned company.
Dr. Winship responded that it was not a minority-owned company.
Commissioner Peraica asked if ACS Healthcare Solutions can guarantee no-cost overruns and that they
will not come to the County Board for an additional appropriation other than what is indicated in the
contract.
Mr. Bracken stated that ACS Healthcare Solutions can do the work as requested and as scoped by the
County's RFP for the prices and the commitments that were made in their response.
Commissioner Peraica inquired whether ACS Healthcare Solutions will retain all of the currently
employed Foster Group personnel as part of their team that will go through the transi tion if the agreement
is approved through the end of 2006 and beyond.
Mr. Bracken responded that ACS Healthcare Solutions will attempt to retain as many individuals as
possible.
Commissioner Peraica asked if the County's staff or the current vendor take longer than anticipated,
would that increase the cost.
Mr. Bracken stated that the cost could not be increased unless it was legally agreed and contracted to
increase it.
Commissioner Daley requested that the Commissioners receive clarification before this contract ts
approved at the September 7, 2006 Board Meeting as to whether it is in litigation.
Commissioner Claypool asked what strategy ACS Healthcare Solutions will use for achieving the 41 %
savings.
Mr. Bracken stated that ACS Healthcare Solutions looked at the commitment based on the RFP, the staff
that needs to be put in place, the cost of maintaining the staff and additional training for some of the
employees that would remain and a fair profit; and that is how ACS Healthcare Solutions arrived at that
number.

Commissioner Daley, seconded by Commissioner Gorman, moved approval of Communication No.
280247, as amended. Commissioner Claypool called for a Roll Call, the vote of yeas and nays being

WHEREAS, when the United States military has been called upon to send forces into hanns way, the
sons and daughters of our great County of Cook, in the State of Illinois, have answered the call. These

WHEREAS, as mandated by state law, Cook County government has principal responsibility for the
protection of persons and property, the provision for public health services and the maintenance of
County highways; and
WHEREAS, inherent to this core mission, the County provides judicial and law enforcement services
comprising the Circuit Court of Cook County, which is the largest unified court system in the world; the
Cook County Department of Corrections, which is the largest single-site jail in the nation and the Cook
County Juvenile Temporary Detention Center, the first juvenile center in the nation and one of the largest;
the Bureau of Health Services, which administers the County's public health services and is the second
largest public health system in the nation; and the Cook County Highway Department which is
responsible for the design and maintenance of over 578 miles of roadways in the County; and
WHEREAS, public safety and healthcare services represent approximately 65% of Cook County's
Budget; and
WHEREAS, providing services related to our core mission is an increasingly expensive and difficult
undertaking, especially in light of ever escalating healthcare costs along with federal cuts in Medicaid and
Medicare; and
WHEREAS, obligating counties that spend more than $100 million a year on purchases for goods and
services to withhold 3% of almost every payment to a vendor or contractor on behalf of the federal
government, while not similarly obligating the private sector, puts counties such as Cook at a
disadvantage by increasing costs to finance government contracts; and
WHEREAS, the ability to competitively bid for contracts is a major component in helping keep costs
down; and
WHEREAS, although this unfunded mandate is not scheduled to become active until FY2011, the
expensive preparation and administrative changes necessary to implement it will need to take place prior
to its start date; and
WHEREAS, Cook County is already facing a budget crisis, with an approximately $56 million shortfall
for the current FY2006 budget and the FY2007 budget process fast approaching; and

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 7, 2006

WHEREAS, the departments that make up the government of Cook County are or may need to eliminate
important services, upon which our citizens have come to rely in order to present balanced budgets in the
future; and
WHEREAS, federal and/or state unfunded mandates only serve to compound the problem of trying to
pay for services integral to our core mission by reallocating monies to pay for these mandates, which
would otherwise be used to provide County services; and
WHEREAS, the manner in which this unfunded mandate was passed, lacking the proper scrutiny, is
antithetical to the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners, does
hereby urge the United States Congress to repeal this major unfunded mandate, so as not to further burden
counties such as Cook with costly programs, which only serve to complicate the task of providing core
services to our citizens without increasing revenues via such unpopular measures as raising taxes and
fees ; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLV ED, that a suitable copy of this Resolution be delivered to the U.S.
Congressmen representing the congressional districts within Cook County, as well as Senators Barack
Obama and Richard Durbin.
Approved and adopted this 7th day of September 2006.
