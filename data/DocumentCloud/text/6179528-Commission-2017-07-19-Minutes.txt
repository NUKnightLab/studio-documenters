8. Branding Discussion
There was a discussion whether to continue with Sparkfactor for the Hello Howard campaign or find
another marketing company. Sandi Price, RPBA had email out to commissioners 5 marketing companies
that were collected from the SSA #43 which had issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) for marketing
companies. SSA #43 hired Sparkfactor for their branding/marketing.

 Cally Radunzel advocated to keep Sparkfactor as the branding/marketing company since $30,000 had
already spent on them to develop the Hello Howard campaign and the next step was to have them
tweak the campaign. If the SSA changes marketing companies then the SSA starts all over again.
Simon Freeman expressed that the Sparkfactor didnâ€™t really do much work for $30,000 and did not
analyze the business community and used a mock up design for the final. Barry Hoven expressed his
dislike of the Hello Howard campaign and likes the work of A5 Branding & Digital company. The
commissioners would like to have A5 Branding & Digital company attend the next SSA #19 meeting on
Aug. 16, 2017.
There was a general discussion on banners and how effective they are. It was agreed to discuss &
resolve what to do about the marketing /branding companies at the strategic planning session on Aug.
29, 2017.
A survey will be sent to get input from community stakeholders.
