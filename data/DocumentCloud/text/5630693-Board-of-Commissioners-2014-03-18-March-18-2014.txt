(Item 4)
The resolution for Item 4 approves submittal of the FY2013 Moving to Work (MTW) Annual Report
to HUD. CHA and HUD signed the original MTW Agreement on February 6, 2000 which allowed
CHA to implement the original Plan for Transformation. CHA’s Amended and Restated MTW
Agreement with HUD was fully executed on June 26, 2008 which extended CHA’s participation in the
MTW Demonstration Program through FY2018. In April 2013, CHA unveiled a new strategic plan,
Plan Forward: Communities that Work, which outlines the agency’s newly articulated mission and
strategic goals that will guide CHA’s current and future work. As CHA implements Plan Forward
initiatives, the agency will continue to pursue the three statutory objectives of the MTW
Demonstration Program: MTW Statutory Objective I: Increase housing choices for low-income
families. MTW Statutory Objective II: Give incentives to families with children where the head of
household is working, seeking work, or is preparing for work by participating in job training,
educational programs, or programs that assist people to obtain employment and become economically
self-sufficient. MTW Statutory Objective III: Reduce costs and achieve greater cost effectiveness in
federal expenditures. As part of the MTW Agreement, CHA is required to submit an Annual Report to
HUD, due 90 days after the end of the fiscal year. The FY2013 MTW Annual Report provides
information necessary for HUD to assess CHA’s performance in FY2013 regarding both day-to-day
operations and activities authorized by the MTW Demonstration Program. In May 2013, HUD issued a
revised Form 50900 (Attachment B to the Amended and Restated MTW Agreement) which outlines
new requirements for the content of MTW Annual Plans/Reports and for tracking the impact of MTW
activities. CHA’s FY2013 MTW Annual Report is the first document in which CHA must fully adopt
these new reporting requirements. CHA will continue to work with HUD to ensure compliance with
the new Form 50900.
RESOLUTION NO. 2014-CHA-29
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated March 12, 2014
requesting approval of the FY2013 Moving to Work Annual Report, attached hereto;
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED BY CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT

the Board of Commissioners hereby approves the attached FY2013 Moving to Work
Annual Report and grants authorization to the Chief Executive Officer, the Board
Chairperson, or their designee to make any final updates as deemed necessary.

 THAT

the Board of Commissioners grants authorization to submit the FY2013 Moving to
Work Annual Report to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development on
March 31, 2014. Such approval shall constitute conclusive evidence of the Board’s
approval of any and all such changes.

(Item 5)
The resolution for Item 5 approves a contract for the redevelopment and a Predevelopment Loan
Agreement with BMD-I, LLC for the redevelopment of Clybourn/Division Development. The
Amended Cabrini Consent Decree of 2001 guides the redevelopment effort for the former Cabrini
Extension North site and related parcels in the Near North Area. The Consent Decree stipulates
redevelopment of 700 public housing and 270 affordable rental units based on an income mix of 50%
market rate, 30% public housing and 20% affordable. The Consent Decree also stipulates CabriniGreen LAC participation on CHA and City land, among other items related to redevelopment of
Cabrini Extension North. To date, a total of 434 public housing and 153 affordable rental units have
been delivered in mixed income housing. The City of Chicago (City) released a Request for Proposals
on September 20, 2010 for planning, redevelopment, and management of a new mixed-income, midrise rental building including retail/commercial space. As a City-approved Developer, BrinshoreMichaels submitted this project under the Cabrini Consent Decree. As required, the project was
noticed to the public and one other response was received. Brinshore-Michaels was found most
responsive to City and CHA goals and was selected the developer by the Near North Working Group.
The Clybourn/Division 42,618 sq. ft. site that fronts both Clybourn and Division is a City-owned
parcel currently used by City Farms. The site is bounded by Clybourn Ave. on the east, Division St.
on the south, Cleveland Ave. on the west, and a public alley north of Division. Parkside of Old Town
development is directly across the site, on the south side of Division St. The redevelopment is
comprised of 77 mixed-income units with 24 public housing, 15 affordable and 38 market rate units. It
also includes approximately 17,200 sq. ft. of retail/commercial space including, but not limited, to a
daycare and restaurant and 11,200 sq. ft. of community space including a roof-top community garden.
The $833,850 CHA loan will not exceed 75% of eligible Clybourn/Division third party
predevelopment costs consistent with HUD cost control guidelines. The total predevelopment budget is
$1,111,800 and the developer will cover the remaining 25% of the budget. This loan will help fund
predevelopment costs that include: architectural and engineering design development and construction
documents, permit fees, technical reports and surveys, and related real estate services. All
predevelopment funds loaned will be repaid in full to CHA at the project’s transaction closing.
RESOLUTION NO. 2014-CHA-30
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated March 12, 2014
entitled Authorization to 1) Enter into a Contract for Redevelopment with BMD-I, LLC
for the Clybourn/Division development; 2) Enter into a Predevelopment Loan
Agreement with BMD-I, LLC in an amount not to exceed $833,850; and 3) Execute and
deliver such other documents and perform such actions as may be necessary or
appropriate to implement the foregoing.
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to
1) Enter into a Contract for Redevelopment with BMD-I, LLC (Brinshore-Michaels) for
the Clybourn/Division development; 2) Enter into a Predevelopment Loan Agreement
with BMD-I, LLC in an amount not to exceed $833,850; and 3) Execute and deliver
5

 such other documents and perform such actions as may be necessary or appropriate to
implement the foregoing.
This award is subject to the Contractor’s compliance with the CHA’s MBE/WBE/DBE,
Section 3 and insurance requirements.
(Item 6)
The resolution for Item 6 approves the CHA’s medical marijuana policy. Marijuana for medical use in
the State of Illinois became legal on January 1, 2014 with the passing of the Compassionate Use of
Medical Cannabis Pilot Program Act. The Act removed state-level criminal penalties on the use and
possession of an adequate supply of marijuana by a registered qualified patient. Once this law came
into effect, CHA was required by HUD to develop and adopt a Medical Marijuana Policy abiding by
federal laws and the recommendations made by HUD. These policies are to apply to all housing
assistance programs and to all current residents or applicants of these programs. HUD’s memorandum
makes no distinction between the use or possession of medical marijuana by a member of the
household and the use or possession of any illegal controlled substance. HUD states that the policy
must prohibit admission to the program or admission to federally assisted housing for any household
with a member who at the time of consideration is using or possessing medical marijuana.
Additionally, HUD states that there must be a termination policy based on the use or possession of
medical marijuana available to those current tenants or members receiving assistance. Public housing
authorities have statutorily authorized discretion in the eviction or termination of services process
when basing such action on the use or possession of medical marijuana as indicated by HUD. Further,
HUD mandates that public housing authorities deny all reasonable accommodation requests made
requesting the use or possession of medical marijuana pursuant to the HUD Fair Housing and Equal
Opportunity Office’s January 20, 2011, memorandum. The CHA’s Medical Marijuana Policy
incorporates all the requirements put forth in HUD’s memorandum. Specifically, the CHA’s Medical
Marijuana Policy: denies the admission of any applicant who is engaged in the use of medical
marijuana to its programs; maintains discretionary oversight in the treatment of current residents who
use medical marijuana; categorically denies any request for use of medical marijuana as a reasonable
accommodation.
RESOLUTION NO. 2014-CHA-31
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated March 12, 2014,
entitled “RECOMMENDATION TO APPROVE THE CHICAGO HOUSING
AUTHORITY’S MEDICAL MARIJUANA POLICY”;
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT

the Board of Commissioners hereby authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to approve the Chicago Housing Authority’s Medical Marijuana policy.

THAT

the Board of Commissioners hereby approves as an amendment the CHA’s Medical
Marijuana Policy to the current and all future iterations of the CHA’s Admissions and
Continued Occupancy Policy and the CHA’s Administrative Plan for the Housing
Choice Voucher Program.

There being no questions or discussion, Chairwoman Scott thereupon declared said Motion carried and
said resolutions adopted.
Commissioner Jack Markowski then presented the report of the Finance Committee. Per
Commissioner Markowski, due to a lack of quorum on Wednesday, March 12, 2014, the Finance
Committee did not officially meet, however, Commissioners and the public were briefed on the item
appearing on the agenda, and the item was open to comments and questions from Commissioners and
the public, but for the record, no vote was taken. On behalf of the Finance Committee, Commissioner
Markowski then presented a Motion for the approval of Item 7:
(Item 7)
The CHA must annually renew its insurance coverage for the Property Manager’s Insurance Program
(PMIP). In 2001, HUD authorized the CHA to have its insurance broker of record competitively
solicit bids on CHA’s behalf for all forthcoming insurance procurements. An integral component of
CHA's marketing plan has been the property tour. Underwriters were invited to a presentation by CHA
staff and a tour of three development locations. The tour was designed to give the underwriters a firsthand look at each type of development (Senior, Family, Scattered Sites) and to allow informal question
and answer sessions with the PPM staff. This strategy supports the touted success of the Plan for
Transformation and the resulting improvement in CHA's real estate portfolio, which is reflected in
improved claim results and increased competition by insurers willing to provide coverage. The
Authority’s investment in the Life Safety upgrades for Senior high-rise buildings was of particular
interest to the underwriters. Aon directly and indirectly (through one wholesaler) solicited requests for
insurance premium quotes from 22 insurance carriers for each line of the coverage lines. The
solicitation notice was also posted on CHA’s website and assist agencies were notified that this
solicitation was conducted by Aon on CHA's behalf. Aon was able to obtain competition in each layer
of coverage and received quotes from four new carriers. After reviewing the premium quotes, AON
and CHA’s Risk Management Department recommend that insurance coverage for CHA's PMIP be
purchased through its insurance broker of record, Aon, for the period of April 1, 2014 through March
31, 2015 for an aggregate amount not-to-exceed $1,152,646 broken down as follows: (1) Primary
General Liability coverage written through Swiss Re American Holding/First Specialty (rating A+ XV)
in an amount not-to-exceed $515,213; (2) Umbrella Liability coverage written through Ace
USA/Illinois Union (rating A+ XV) in an amount not-to-exceed $466,493; and (3) Excess Liability
written through Ironshore (rating A IV) in an amount not-to-exceed $170,940.
