Jeanelle Greene, Department of Information Technology and Jack Rhyne, Project Manager, InFor,
presented. Dale Miller indicated his support for this request to keep the Enterprise Resource Planning
(ERP) project on schedule and asked if another change order related to financial components has been
negotiated with InFor; asked about the anticipated timeline to reach an agreement for that change order;
and asked when the next “go live” date will be.

14

 Nan Baker asked what is being implemented through these change orders and what would be delayed if
these change orders did not get approved; asked if shifting funds will diminish other funding needed to
qualify for the workforce management training; asked where the funding for the workforce management
training is coming from; asked if there is any concern of running out of funds because the training piece
was larger than expected and asked whether the IPA workshop is related to this training and why this
contract ends in 2021 when completion is anticipated to occur sooner.
Dennis Kennedy asked how payment on these change orders will occur in connection with the agreedupon installment payment schedule presented to County Council last November, and if they will occur
outside of that payment schedule and be invoiced separately. Mr. Kennedy clarified that these change
orders are not $0 impact and that the County will be paying for these change orders; and asked if the
original payment schedule included these payments.
Ms. Baker also asked for clarification on the use of the 99 Fund and how much remains in that fund; and
asked if there are other funds similar to the 99 Fund.
Mr. Miller asked for confirmation that the 99 Fund is basically a contingency fund and asked what happens
to unused funds.
Kahlil Seren asked what was the process by which the amount for the 99 Fund was determined and how
much of the fund is expected to be used.
Dale Miller motioned to approve the item; Michael Dever seconded. Item BC2019-466 was unanimously

period 7/1/2019 – 6/30/2020.
Funding Source: Temporary Assistance to Needy Families Fund
Robert Math, Cuyahoga Job and Family Services, presented. Nan Baker asked for clarification on the sole
source process. Lenora Lockett explained that the sole source process is based on specific needs of the
department and a process including a public posting to solicit responses to services being sought; stated
that the vendor must provide a sole source affidavit stating that no other vendor can provide services.
Ms. Lockett also acknowledged that the market can change at any time, which is why the process must
be conducted every time a new contract is required. Ms. Baker recommended that a process should be
followed next time to determine whether this service is still considered sole source. Dale Miller asked if
funding, either directly or indirectly, is for staff expenses or more for direct services. Dennis Kennedy
commented that the cost increased from the prior year’s contracts since this vendor was identified as a
sole source provider. Kahlil Seren asked for clarification regarding the Earned Income Tax Credit serving
as an entry point for financial education and asset development, as stated in briefing materials and asked
if there is any follow up with clients on how the funds are used. Dennis Kennedy motioned to approve the
item; Michael Dever seconded. Item BC2019-468 was unanimously approved as amended.

Funding Source: 50% Special Revenue Fund – (Certified Professional Training) and 50% Commissary Funds
Tanisha Gates and Sergeant O’Conner, Sheriff’s Department, presented. Kahlil Seren said he does not
want to contribute to a situation where staff are being trained to react in circumstances where their
response could have negative consequences, that may not be necessary and asked if real world scenarios
are used as a guide when selecting immersive training methods, which may not be wholly healthy to the
community. Michael Dever asked where the simulator will be housed. Dennis Kennedy motioned to
approve the item; Michael Dever seconded. Item BC2019-471 was unanimously approved.
The following item was amended to include the scope expansion.

Funding Source: Commissary Funds
Brandy Carney, Department of Public Safety and Justice Services, presented. Dale Miller asked how many
non-law enforcement employees are at the Sheriff’s Department. Dennis Kennedy asked for clarification
on the eligible use of Commissary Funds for this amendment. Nan Baker asked if the additional site visit
has taken place and if this will be the final visit. Dale Miller commented that while the American
Correctional Association site visits are beneficial, the County should rely on internal assessments and
asked what process is in place to gather information and communicate the state of the conditions at the
Jail to Sheriff’s officials; and stated that additional discussions on this matter, separate from this request,
will be necessary. Dennis Kennedy motioned to approve the item; Michael Dever seconded. Item BC2019472 was unanimously approved as amended.

The procurement method for this project is RFP Exemption. The total value of the RFP Exemption
purchase is $59,575.53. Public Works originally utilized informal competitive bidding within the County’s
purchasing software, Buyspeed Online under two separate requisitions. Two attempts were made in
Buyspeed for each request and garnered only one response from the recommended vendor for the
requested furniture and materials.
An RFP exemption is needed as the purchase is being made off a Government Cooperative Purchasing
Contract.
The Department of Public Works is establishing best practices in asset management by using the furniture
currently employed at the Cuyahoga County Headquarters as the furniture standard moving forward.
Having the same furniture in both the Headquarter building and the new Harvard Road Maintenance

33

 location will allow for furniture inventory to be deployed between buildings as well as augment product
warranties and availability as standard.
APG Office Furnishings
3615 Superior Avenue, Suite 700A
Cleveland, Ohio 44114
The account representative for APG Office Furnishings is Joe Moran.
The project is new to the County.
The project is under construction and must be able to support relocated public works offices for relocation
in late summer 2019. The buildings which both divisions currently occupy must be vacated as both
properties are for sale and need to be emptied as soon as possible. The lead time to manufacture the
standard furniture is 6 to 8 weeks. This furniture must be in place before the divisions are able to move
into the new space.
The project is funded 100% by the General Fund – Capital Projects.
The schedule of payments is by invoice.
