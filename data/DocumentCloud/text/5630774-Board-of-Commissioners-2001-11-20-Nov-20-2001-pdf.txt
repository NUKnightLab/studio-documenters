The Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority held its Regular meeting on Tuesday,
November 20, 2001 at 8:30 a.m. at the Charles Hayes Family Investment Center, located at 4859

The meeting was called to order by the Chairperson and, upon roll call, those present and absent

There being a quorum present, the meeting duly convened and business was transacted as follows:
The Chairperson convened the Public Hearing portion of the meeting by inviting residents and the
public at large to address the Board.
Immediately following the Public Hearing Session, Terry Peterson, Chief Executive Officer,
presented his monthly report. Per Mr. Peterson, the CHA budget is almost $1 billion dollars,
which is dramatically larger than last year's budget due to the added capital dollars that were raised
in the bond market. The capital program will increase from $395 million this year to $632 next
year. This increase will help to meet the goal of completing 4000 senior units and 2000 family
units. The capital budget also includes more money for property management and a special $25
million set-aside for extraordinary maintenance projects. Mr. Peterson stated that staffing levels
are at the lowest in decades, with less than 500 employees working for the CHA. He stated that
the Section 8 component of the budget, which includes relocation, has seen a $32 million increase.
This increase includes the spending for counseling, workshops, and other support services to help
families transition to new homes and communities. The CHA also has an ongoing program to
upgrade heating, lighting, and plumbing systems in the senior buildings with a goal of making
them more energy efficient. The CHA is looking to save over $3 million each year in energy costs.

 Mr. Peterson stated that he visited a warehouse where gift baskets for more than 2800 CHA
families were being assembled. While several companies were donors of items for the gift baskets,
it was noted that Jewel Foods was the largest, supplying 2000 turkeys and all the trimmings. As a
result of the generosity of Jewel Foods and the other donors, many CHA families would have a
happy, well-fed Thanksgiving.

elevators at Hilliard Homes (2030 S. State Street and 30 W. Cermak Road)
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his designee
to ratify the contract with the City Elevator Company in the amount of $502,010 for
the replacement of two (2) elevators at Hilliard Homes, one of which is located in the
Family Building at 2030 S. State and the other in the Senior Building at 30 W.
Cermak and authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to disburse these
funds from the $33 million that has been approved for the redevelopment of Hilliard
pursuant to Board Resolution No. 2000-CHA 149, and authorizes and ratifies
advances from such $33 million to restore operations.

(Item B10)
Amendment of a previously approved Resolution involving the CHA development process for the
predevelopment services at the approximately 28 acre site at Henry Horner is requested because of
revisions to the planning budget which included additional tasks that have increased the initial
planning budget. The development process is phased and is to be contracted in phases. The
additional tasks have resulted in the utilization of the full budgeted amount discussed in the
previous Board Resolution, which increases CHA's contribution by $40,000 for the
predevelopment services of Henry Horner Phase II.
RESOLUTION 2001-CHA-170
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners reviewed the Board Letter dated November 20, 2001,
requesting authorization to Amend Resolution 2001-CHA-109 passed by the Board
of Commissioners on August 21, 2001 for Predevelopment Services to increase the
not to exceed $450,000 and concurs with the recommendation contained therein;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorize the Chief Executive Officer or his designee
to Amend Predevelopment Services with Brinshore-Michaels Development Team in
an amount not to exceed $450,000 covering initial predevelopment planning and
predevelopment activities and community supportive service planning, subject to
HUD approval.

THAT,

Resolution 2001-CHA-109 passed by the Board on August 21, 2001, is hereby
amended to the extent it is inconsistent with this Resolution.

(Item B11)
The CHA previously awarded a contract to provide and install steel security doors and window
screens that are more resistant to forced entry than the brick and board method of securing property
that the CHA had employed in the past. Absent a new procurement, the CHA must still be able to
secure vacant properties from trespass and inclement weather in order to prevent further damage to
the properties and to prevent the creation of dangerous and hazardous conditions to the residents.
An increase to the not-to-exceed amount of the original contract is recommended to secure vacant
buildings that are scheduled for demolition, against trespass and damage from the elements.
RESOLUTION 2001-CHA-171
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated November 16,
2001 entitled “APPROVAL FOR A $300,000.00 INCREASE TO THE NOT-TOEXCEED AMOUNT OF CONTRACT #9351 WITH VACANT PROPERTY
SECURITY, INC. (VPS) TO SECURE VACANT BUILDINGS THAT ARE
SCHEDULED FOR DEMOLITION, AGAINST TRESPASS AND DAMAGE
11

 FROM THE ELEMENTS.”
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his designee
to increase the not-to-exceed contract amount of contract #9351 with Vacant
Property Security, Inc. (VPS) by $300,000.00 to secure vacant buildings that are
scheduled for demolition, against trespass and damage from the elements, subject to
HUD approval.

(Item B12)
Amendment of the Procurement Policy is recommended because specific requirements in the CHA
Procurement Policy relating to selection by formal or informal solicitation do not apply. Because
these privately funded procurements are not subject to HUD requirements, the procurement
standards of the grant application or agreement between the private foundation and the CHA shall
govern exclusively.

WHEREAS,

RESOLUTION 2001- CHA-172
the Board of Commissioners have reviewed Board Letter dated
October 28, 2001 requesting Approval of the amended CHA Procurement
Policy;

THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners hereby approves the amended CHA
Procurement Policy attached hereto and authorizes its application to all
CHA procurement transactions.

(Item C1)
As part of the CHA Plan for Transformation, residents attend Housing Choice Survey Clinics
where they learn of the temporary and permanent housing options available to them, as well as
completing the Housing Choice Survey form which indicates their choice. It was decided that an
outside organization could conduct the Housing Choice Survey Clinics more effectively and the
CHA identified Right Moves as the firm to do so because of past experience. The Housing Choice
Survey Clinics is funded by a grant from the MacArthur Foundation, and it is in the best interest of
the CHA to enter into a contract with Right Moves to conduct the clinics.

 RESOLUTION NO. 2001-CHA-173

(Item C2)
The CHA was awarded $5 million dollars from the U.S. Department of Labor for their response to
a competitive grant program. The grant would extend the sub-grant contracts to the Chicago
Works Project partners in the implementation of programs to move welfare recipients into

there is no additional cost.

Grant to December 31, 2002, with all other terms and conditions remaining
the same, and at no additional cost, subject to approval from the U.S.
Department of Labor (“DOL”).

(Item C3)
The CHA submitted a grant application to the U.S. Department of Commerce/National
Telecommunication Information Administration. The application addressed some of the
challenges related to public access to information, interagency communication and coordination,
and data sharing and exchange experienced by residents and service providers involved in the
relocation process.
An inter-related, multimedia, web-based information and referral, data
exchange system will be created with the funds from this grant, along with required dollar for
dollar matching funds that will come from the MacArthur Foundation's Tenant Relocation
Tracking System grant that was previously awarded. The information exchange system will be
used to assist residents in making informed housing choices and plans. Acceptance of the grant
will support several planned components that will augment and enhance the CHA's developing
relocation-tracking system and will expedite data exchange between the CHA and other agencies
that have an effect on, or are affected by residents involved in the relocation process.
