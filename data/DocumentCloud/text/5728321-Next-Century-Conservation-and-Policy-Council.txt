Racial
Equity

Racial equity occurs when racial identity does
not determine how one fares in society.
Achieving racial equity requires that
we interrogate policies and institutional
practices across the board to identify the
influence of structural racism, and use
processes that include those most impacted in
creating and implementing new equitable
policies and practices.

 Diversity &
Inclusion

Diversity is the range of human
differences, including but not
limited to race, ethnicity, gender
identity, sexual orientation, age,
and physical ability.

Inclusion is involvement and
empowerment, where the
inherent worth and dignity of all
people are recognized.
