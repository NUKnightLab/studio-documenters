Project Introduction
Pyramid Development Co., LLC, a Bedrock Detroit affiliate, is the project developer (the
“Developer”) for the Plan which entails the rehabilitation of the 276,183 square foot former
Detroit Free Press building into a mixed-use building with retail on the first floor, office on
the second and third floors, and residential on floors 4-17 and an undetermined use for
the basement and sub-basement. First through third floor tenants have not been
determined at this time.
It is estimated that 196 temporary construction jobs will be created and 10 direct
permanent jobs will be created in connection with the redevelopment. Additional
permanent jobs are expected to be created by the retail and office tenants. The
Developer has agreed to comply with City Executive Orders.
Total investment is expected to be approximately $69,660,000.00. The Developers are
requesting $7,029,190.00 in TIF reimbursement under the proposed Plan.

 Property Subject to the Plan
The eligible property (the “Property”) consists of a single (1) parcel containing only the
Free Press Building located at 321 West Lafayette Boulevard on the west side of
downtown Detroit.

(a) the property was previously utilized or is currently utilized for a commercial purpose;
(b) it is located within the City of Detroit, a qualified local governmental unit under Act

“eligible activities” as defined by Sec 2 of Act 381, because they include site demolition,
