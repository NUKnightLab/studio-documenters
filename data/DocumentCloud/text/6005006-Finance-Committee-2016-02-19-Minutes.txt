Mr. Elwell provided an overview of the requests presented for the Committee’s consideration.
During the discussion of request numbers 4, 5 and 6, Mr. Elwell stated that the administration thought this
would be a good opportunity to talk about what is done locally with regard to lead poisoning prevention
efforts. He introduced the following individuals from the Cook County Department of Public Health
(CCDPH), who provided information on the subject: Deanna Durica, Director of the Lead Poisoning
Prevention and Healthy Homes Program and Interim Policy Director, and Latrice Porter-Thomas, from the
Environmental Health Services Division, who oversees the enforcement of the Illinois Lead Poisoning
Prevention Act in Cook County.
Director Richardson-Lowry stated that, in light of the national discussion and in light of what is happening in
other cities with older infrastructure, it would be helpful to have on the record what is done when someone
presents with respect to lead, and what rigors are in place within the system, so the Board knows that there is a
proper response. Ms. Durica stated that the Illinois Department of Public Health is the surveillance entity for
the State. All reports of lead levels are sent to them, and they send those reports to delegate agencies.
CCDPH is the delegate agency for suburban Cook County. When CCDPH receives a report of an elevated
blood lead level, there is a cross-disciplinary approach to serving those families and children. All families
receive a nursing case management visit and are followed until their blood lead level drops to acceptable
standards, according to the Academy of Pediatrics and the State thresholds. Additionally, a lead risk assessor
goes out to the home to identify home-based lead hazards that may be present. Ms. Porter-Thomas provided
additional information. She stated that, once the lead risk assessor has identified those hazards, CCDPH will
make contact with the property owner to make them aware that those lead hazards in the home have been
identified and need to be remediated. There are two ways that remediation can be done. The lead risk assessor
will provide the homeowner with an application to CCDPH’s lead poisoning prevention grant to go through
that process, which Ms. Durica oversees, or the homeowner can do the work themselves. If the homeowner
chooses to do the work themselves, the lead risk assessor will work with them to make sure the work is done
properly. In addition to remediating the hazards, there is also a cleaning requirement, as well. After the work
is satisfactorily done, the lead risk assessor will go out to conduct a clearance investigation – this entails them
doing a dust-wipe sample to make sure the dust levels are not such that the child can be re-exposed to lead.
The samples are sent to the State’s laboratory for analysis. As long as those samples come back within State
standards, CCDPH will issue a certificate of compliance, which closes the case; if the sample does not come
back within State standards, CCDPH will continue to work with the homeowner on the cleaning requirements
until the standards are met.
Ms. Durica provided information regarding the circumstances that lead to testing for lead poisoning in
children. The State identifies high-risk areas by zip codes; all zip codes within the entire City of Chicago are
included as high-risk, and there are 13 or 16 zip codes in suburban Cook County that are high-risk areas. If a
child lives in one of those zip codes, by law, they should be tested at ages 12 months and 24 months. That
testing does not always happen. She noted that CCDPH has policy and education activities within its units, as
well, where staff go out and talk to providers about the need to do testing. There is also a paper-based
screening tool with a set of questions regarding the age of housing, if any renovations have been done, and
whether there are any kind of pica tendencies where kids are eating non-food items that could expose them to
lead; if a child or family answers yes to any of those questions, then the provider is supposed to do a venous
blood test to assess for lead exposure.

 III. Action Items
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)
Dr. John Jay Shannon, Chief Executive Officer, noted that the State’s threshold for blood lead levels is higher
than the threshold set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. From a clinical standpoint, the
expectation is that there is no safe lead level. The Committee has heard about the home and lead abatement for
continuing exposure; he asked for further information on what is clinically done with the children if they are
found to have a high lead level beyond the abatement work. Ms. Durica stated that, when the affected child is
referred to CCDPH and the lead risk assessor goes out to their home, essentially their “client” is the home until
the lead hazard is remediated. When CCDPH’s nursing case managers go out to the home, for them, the child
is the client. They do behavioral assessment and the ages and stages questionnaire, in order to assess for
developmental delay or problems. They also perform nutritional assessments and case management with the
primary care provider to ensure that repeat testing is being done and that the child is monitored.
Director Richardson-Lowry noted that the entirety of the City of Chicago is within the framework of those
needing to be tested; she inquired further regarding the rigor around testing, and asked that a report be
provided in response to the following questions - are we testing, and how do we know we are testing?
Director Gugenheim noted that she has followed this issue over the past 25 years; the problem is that there is
never enough money to do the remediation that is required. She inquired as to what point in the year CCDPH
runs out of money for this activity, and what happens after that. Ms. Durica stated that the grant money is
allocated each year, but that does not represent the amount CCDPH spends within suburban Cook County for
this. The Chicago, Evanston and Oak Park dollars indicated on the transmittals are their funding for this year;
funding is determined through negotiation with those grantees after they responded to a Request for Proposals
(RFP) making the case for the burden of lead poisoning in their jurisdiction and their capacity to do
remediation for this year. She concurred with Director Gugenheim that there is not enough money to get all of
the work done. Chairman Collens stated for the record that the budget for that is not determined by this Board.
Ms. Durica stated that it does speak to the fact that across the nation there is not enough money to do
remediation in homes, especially in low-income homes.
Director Junge inquired whether the testing for lead includes testing of water pipes. Ms. Porter-Thomas
responded in the negative; she stated that testing of water is done by each municipality. Ms. Durica stated that
each municipality submits a report on any contaminants in the water twice a year; they also work with the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency to monitor those levels. CCDPH has not had any indications from extreme
numbers of children with lead poisoning where no other source of lead exposure can be found, but if that were
the case, then they have the ability to talk to the State about testing the water, if needed. Chairman Collens
stated that it is his understanding that the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District adds a chemical to the
water that should seal the lead pipes and prevent lead from leaching into the water.
Director Butler inquired regarding how many agencies are doing this work of remediation and services to
children in the area. Ms. Durica stated that the State-certified health departments have jurisdiction for doing
lead investigations, remediation and case management in their jurisdictions, so CCDPH does not repeat any of
the work being done in the City of Chicago; CCDPH’s jurisdiction covers children in suburban Cook County.
There is collaborative work that is done; she noted that a regional summit was convened a couple of years ago
to talk about policy and education activities to prevent lead poisoning. She added that there are some
community-based organizations that do some housing rehabilitation work; CCDPH is working more and more
with them to reduce the disproportionate burden of lead poisoning that falls on low-income communities and
communities of color.

 III. Action Items
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)
With regard to request number 16, Mr. Elwell provided additional information. He stated that this request is to
execute a sole source contract with Community Counseling Centers of Chicago (C4) relating to the pilot
project to create a behavioral health triage center. A location for this purpose has been identified on the south
side of Chicago. At this time the administration is trying to bring up the rest of its behavioral health services there are significant numbers of openings for social workers and other types of positions, and it is not believed
that this pilot project can be staffed up with CCHHS staff at this time. Additionally, CCHHS staff does not
possess all of the training that C4 staff have; C4 staff performs Assertive Community Treatment and do a lot of
other interventions and services that CCHHS staff have not done and will need to learn. CCHHS gets referrals
from this process, and does not expect all the work to be done here. There will be triage services performed at
that location; following triage, they will move the patient on to the provider who is closest geographically and
who has the evidence-based practice for the treatment needed. C4 is also working with the consortium of six
(6) other organizations that works with the CountyCare Health Plan and CCHHS’ Department of Psychiatry.
There will be a single phone number that can be called and answered, and no patient will be turned away.
Regardless of the patient’s condition or payment source, this group has agreed that they will answer that
phone. They will also answer calls from providers in the network, so if a primary care provider needs a little
help understanding their patient’s condition, this organization will provide information and counseling to that
primary care provider. As this is a pilot project, the administration does not want to bring on permanent fulltime people for these services at this time; leadership believes that this is the right thing to do and that it will be
successful, but there is no guarantee. If the pilot project is successful, in 18 months time, Mr. Elwell stated
that he will be talking to this Committee about operating five (5) locations, not one (1); when that happens,
questions will be deliberated regarding whether an RFP should be developed for the provision of services
externally or whether to provide these services by in-house staff.
Mr. Elwell provided information on the location selected for the pilot project. Staff looked at the correlation of
people that leave the detainee situation and go to live in the community; this area selected has the highest
concentration of that population, so it made sense that this would be the first location. He noted that the
administration has also notified a hospital located in that community about these plans, and have talked about
the potential of working collaboratively with them.
In response to a question raised regarding provision of services to the homeless population, Mr. Elwell stated
that, while those individuals may not have an address, they usually have a place where they are mainly located.
C4 is very accustomed to going where the patient is located, so their services historically are not limited to
physical buildings - staff go out into the streets. They would work with that individual patient to determine
where that patient is most comfortable receiving services, and if that does not work, there will be people who
will outreach for them. The idea is to try to get patients into care, and that the care is rendered in some place
other than the jail.
Director Gugenheim inquired regarding training of the police force. Mr. Elwell stated that another reason for
selecting C4 is because they have been heavily involved in the Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) training that
some of the police officers have received. He noted that not all police officers have been trained for this, but
C4 has a good relationship with the leadership in the Chicago Police Department who are responsible for CIT
training.

 III. Action Items
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)
Director Junge requested additional information regarding the consortium. Mr. Elwell stated that it consists of
a group of substance abuse and mental health providers primarily located on the south and west sides of
Chicago. Their membership in this consortium is due to their openness to work in this type of situation and
ability to be collaborative, and because many of them have suffered because the capacity grants were cut off by
the State as a result of budget issues. It is expected that this consortium will grow, based on needs identified.
Director Richardson-Lowry noted that the contract requires that specific outcomes are measured; she inquired
regarding examples of specific outcomes, and asked who will measure them from a staffing standpoint. Mr.
Elwell stated that C4 is going to provide the staff that is going to be under CCHHS direction. CCHHS
psychiatrists are going to be providing the psychiatric backup, so that will have them overseeing many things,
but most of the care for this population will be rendered by social workers and other types of counselors. With
regard to measurement of specific outcomes, Mr. Elwell provided examples of potential metrics that are being
considered. They will likely tie into justice system involvement – for example, this person had six (6)
encounters with the justice system prior to receiving treatment – how many encounters did that person have
after they started receiving treatment? They are interested in determining whether this treatment project
prevented that person from ending up in jail, or helped them to have consistent housing or a job. The literature
on this subject indicates that these are signs of success and signs of lower cost over time, and they will be
measured.
With regard to request number 17, Mr. Elwell stated that this is a sole source contract for the provision of
Operating Room (OR) registered nurses and certified OR technicians. The administration has not been able to
hire for those positions in sufficient numbers to staff the OR, nor have the staffing agencies that CCHHS
currently engage been able to supply what is needed. This vendor recruits nurses and technicians from around
the country, brings them in and houses them for the contract period. The aim is to continue recruiting activities
to fill all of these positions with CCHHS employees. Director Richardson-Lowry noted that this contract has a
high spend rate; she inquired whether this is a national issue, and asked whether a pipeline process can be
developed for this category. Mr. Elwell responded that there are not enough nurses going into that area of
specialty. He noted that it takes CCHHS six (6) months to train an OR nurse. The administration is focused
on two (2) things – training its own nurses when possible, and using certified OR technicians more than has
been historically done.
With regard to request number 23, Mr. Elwell indicated that this company is the sole manufacturer, distributor
and supplier of these products.
Director Wiese, seconded by Director Richardson-Lowry, moved the approval of
request numbers 1 through 24, subject to completion of review by Contract
Compliance, where appropriate. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

 IV. Report from the Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Finance and Strategy (Attachment #3)
A. Metrics
B. Financial Statements through December 2015
C. Report of emergency purchases
D. CountyCare Update
Mr. Elwell reviewed the presentation that included information on Metrics, Preliminary Financial Statements
through December 2015 and an update on CountyCare. The Committee discussed the information.
During the discussion of the Financial Statements, Mr. Elwell stated that CCHHS did not have a good month in
December; this is related primarily to the expectation of capturing $25 million worth of CountyCare activity – only
$15 million was captured. Some of that revenue was made up by the increase of capture rate from other Managed
Care Organizations (MCOs); inpatient activity with the other MCOs went up by approximately $3 million in this
time period. Chairman Collens inquired whether there has been improvement in the capture rate for January. Mr.
Elwell responded in the negative; however, he stated that several programs or initiatives are expected to positively
impact this, including the behavioral health program, which is expected to have a fair capture rate, the MRI which
will soon be going on-line at the Oak Forest Health Center, and the big increase expected in mammography
services. The administration is continually looking at this; they look at what CCHHS’ own referral pattern is, and
that pattern reflects that those referrals are not quite at the level desired.
Mr. Elwell stated that an 8% drop was seen in pharmacy expenses; that reduction is due to a change in practice. If
CCHHS did not have a contract with a patient’s managed care plan for pharmacy services, historically CCHHS has
provided those pharmaceuticals to the patient for free and was not reimbursed by the patient’s managed care plan;
however, now CCHHS is working with those patients to find a pharmacy near their home that has a contract with
the managed care company for pharmacy services.
Director Richardson-Lowry referenced the income statement differential; she stated that this is significant - it
should keep the Directors up at night, and if this continues, there will have to be a different discussion that takes
place. This could be a potentially devastating blow to the System; she asked that, as Mr. Elwell comes back and
updates the Committee, he does so with the understanding that this an area that the Committee has to look at very
closely. Mr. Elwell concurred; he noted that he will keep the Board updated, and in the future, with Chief Financial
Officer Ekerete Akpan’s help, he will provide much more detailed explanations and review of what is driving the
issues.
With regard to the information provided on the number of days in accounts receivable, Mr. Elwell noted that they
continue to experience challenges relating to coding. ICD-10 is a contributor to the issue, but there are other
contributors; an update on that subject will be provided at the next Finance Committee meeting.
With regard to the information provided on the number of days of cash on hand, Mr. Elwell stated that this number
is expected to drop a little more in January. CCHHS is owed more than $100 million by the State; the
administration is negotiating with them to get some of that money freed up.

Page 6 of 49

 IV. Report from the Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Finance and Strategy (continued)
Director Wiese inquired whether Mr. Elwell was aware of any information relating to Blue Cross Blue Shield
possibly making a movement to cut services to the Family Health Plan (FHP) population. Mr. Elwell responded
that he has not heard anything specific, but there might be a couple of things going on, not just for them, but for a
few plans. Many plans have been paid through December, but he was unsure if all of them have been paid. The
plans contain a provision in their contracts that gives them the ability after 60 days of not being paid by the State to
stop paying providers. Additionally, the new capitation rates being seen from the State reflect significant
reductions. These are very significant; a big part of this is related to the fact that there was an assumption made by
the State of the use of UIC and Stroger Hospital facilities by those plans’ members and what would be paid for that
usage. He believes that many of the plans were able to balance their activity on the back of those extra payments
they received but did not pass on, so now that is going away. That means that the administration is going to have to
fight hard for its rates, and market opportunity is right around the corner – those affected plans will have to choose
between cutting back or leaving the marketplace.
There were no emergency purchases to report at this time.

COOK COUNTY HHS FINANCE COMMITTEE:

We are the security of?cers who protect and make sure Cook County?s health centers are
safe. We are the ?rst line of defense for patients, staff, and anyone coming through the doors of
the clinics in some of the county's most aggressive and dangerous areas. We are being cheated of

the wages and bene?ts we are owed by our employers, Digby Detective Services and their
subcontractor.

As of?cers working in county health centers, we are due a minimum living wage of $11.66
per hour with health insurance, or $14.57 per hour without health insurance. This is in
accordance with the Cook County Living Wage ordinance referenced in the contract for service
that Digby Detective Services signed with Cook County (Document No. Per Digby?s
contract, we are due wages and bene?ts up to the BOMA standards: that includes any raises,
holiday pay, paid time off, 100% employer-paid health insurance for of?cers working more than

120 hours per month, and pension contributions for of?cers scheduled more than 30 hours per
week.

We have received none of this.

Instead, our employers, ignoring both the Cook County Living Wage Ordinance, and the
county?s own contract for services with our employers, have been paying of?cers at county health
centers only $10.50 per hour, and even as low as $10.25 per hour. The health insurance, when it is
even offered at all, is too expensive and too narrow for us to afford 0n the low wages our
employers choose to pay us. These wages are so low, in fact, that some of us even qualify for 
County Care. We receive no holiday pay, no pension, and little to no paid time off. 

The work we do is critical for Cook County, and cheating the of?cers doing this work is
irresponsible and completely unacceptable. If Digby Detective Services agreed to provide jobs in
Cook County that were up to BOMA standards, yet the of?cers have not receivedthe due wages or
bene?ts, where have our Cook County tax dollars gone? It is the responsibility 'of this committee
to investigate and see to it that the recipients of county dollars abide by the contract fer services.
Therefore, we demand the following:

0 Immediate raise of our wages to the levels agreed upon in the Cook County Living Wage
Ordinance and the contract for services

0 Immediate access to the 100% employer-paid health insurance agreed upon in the

contract for services

Immediate contribution to the pension agreed upon in the contract for services

Immediate payment of holiday pay rates agreed upon in the contract for services

Immediate access to the paid time off agreed upon in the contract for services

Immediate payment of the full back-pay owed as outlined by the Cook County Living

Wage Ordinance

Respectfully,

a/ MA.
