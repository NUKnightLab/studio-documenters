CHAIR’S REPORT
A. Residential Sound Insulation Sub-Committee Report
Mr. Lihosit presented the Residential Sound Insulation Sub-Committee Report
(see attached).
NEW BUSINESS
A. Approval of Resolution 2014-A – which identifies additional homes for inclusion
in Phase 15 of the Residential Sound Insulation Program.
Mr. Lihosit read the Resolution.
Mr. Lazansky asked if it pertained to apartments in buildings that are not owner
occupied and also apartments that are in mixed use buildings. Mr. Frame
responded that all of those residential apartments are now included.
Ms. Pinion asked the number of homes included under this resolution. Mr.
Frame stated that the request is for approval of 1,800 homes that are in addition
to the 900 homes that the Commission already approved. The approval of the
resolution will allow 2,700 homes to be sound insulated. Ms. Pinion asked if
there will be enough funding and Mr. Frame replied that funding is secured.
Mr. Lazansky asked if the contractors awarded the sound insulation contracts
have qualifications that have been thoroughly screened. Mr. Frame replied that
there is a regular pool of construction contractors that bid on the work and
attendance at the Pre-Bid Conference is mandatory for bidding eligibility. The
City of Chicago has competitive bidding that goes through a very closely
scrutinized bidding process. He added that there are numerous checks and
balances in place used to determine both the initial qualifications of a contractor
and to constantly monitor the work as it progresses.
There were no corrections and a motion to approve Resolution 2014-A was
made by Mr. Lazansky and seconded by Mr. Lihosit and Ms. Pinion.
