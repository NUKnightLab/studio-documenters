published, in which case such rate shall be at a comparable index rate selected by the Bank with
notice to the Board. The Bank shall determine the interest rate applicable to the Loans based on
the foregoing, and its determination thereof shall be conclusive and binding except in the case of
manifest error. The interest rate payable hereunder shall be subject, however, to the limitation
that such interest rate shall never be paid at a rate in excess of the Statutory Maximum Rate.

the interbank eurodollar market, or that by reason of circumstances affecting the interbank

LIBOR Rate, or the LIBOR Rate will not adequately and fairly re?ect the cost to such Bank
of funding LIBOR Rate Loans or (ii) that the making or funding of LIBOR Rate Loans becomes
impracticable, then the Bank shall forthwith give notice thereof to the Board, whereupon until
the Bank noti?es the Board, that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer
exist, the obligations of the Bank to make LIBOR Rate Loans shall be suspended and all
outstanding LIBOR Rate Loans shall be converted to Base Rate Loans.

operation of the immediately preceding subclause shall accrue and be payable as provided in
this subclause (ii) and shall, less interest actually paid to the Bank for such period, constitute the
"Excess Amount. If there is any accrued and unpaid Excess Amount as of any date, then, to the

Event of Default, all Loans shall bear interest at the Default Rate.

Loans shall bear interest at the Taxable Rate.

In the event a Determination of Taxability occurs, the Board hereby agrees to
pay to the Bank (and if applicable, each participant) on demand therefor 1) an amount equal to
the difference between (A) the amount of interest that would have been paid to the Bank (and if
applicable, each participant) on the Loans during the period for which interest on the Loans is
included in the gross income of the Bank (and if applicable, each participant) if the Loans had
borne interest at the Taxable Rate, beginning on the Taxable Date (the ?Taxable Period?), and
(B) the amount of interest actually paid to the Bank (and if applicable, each participant) during
the Taxable Period, and (2) an amount equal to any interest, penalties or charges owed by the
Bank (and if applicable, each participant) as a result of interest on the Loans becoming included
in the gross income of the Bank (and if applicable, each participant), together with any and all
reasonable attorneys? fees, court costs, or other out-of?pocket costs incurred by the Bank (and if
applicable, each participant) in connection therewith.

(ii) Subject to the provisions of clause below, the Bank (and if applicable, each
participant) shall afford the Board the opportunity, at the Board?s sole cost and expense, to

amended or modi?ed and is in full force and effect as of the date hereof. Each such
agreement censtitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Board enforceable

which the issue date is 2014, the date of the Initial Advance on the
Notes. The treatment in this paragraph of the Notes, and all Advances thereto, re?ects
the economic substance of the transaction and does not avoid Section 103 or any of

CHARTER RENEWAL PROPOSAL: The Chicago Charter School Foundation submitted a renewal
proposal on September 1, 2011, to continue the Chicago International Charter School under a uni?ed
mission, using ChicagoQuest, Civitas, Edison Schools inc, Distinctive Schools and Victory for
comprehensive school management services. In January 2012, the Chicago Charter School Foundation
submitted a material modi?cation to increase the enrollment at the ClCS?Ralph Ellison Campus, raising
the at capacity enrollment to 630 students. As a result, the charter school shall serve grades Kindergarten
through 12 with a maximum enrollment of 10,111 students.

The agreement incorporates an accountability plan in which the charter school is evaluated by the Board
each year based on numerous factors related to academic, ?nancial and operational performance.

In June 2013, Chicago Charter School Foundation submitted noti?cation to the Of?ce of Innovation and
incubation that the educational management organization for Chicaqo International Charter School 
Irving Park Campus would change from Victory Educational Partners to Distinctive Schools beginni?g

July 1, 2013.

 

The Of?ce of Innovation and Incubation realized that it needed to correct the at capacig enrollment listed
in the board report for the Chicago International Charter School Ralph Ellison Campus from 630 to 570
students, thus decreasing the overall at capacity enrollment of the charter school from 10111 to 10,051
students.

In February 2014, Chicago Charter School Foundation submitted a material modi?cation to increase the
at capacity enrollment at the Chicago International Charter School Northtown Campus by 50 students to
900 students which will increase the overall at capacity enrollment at the charter school to 10,101
students beginning in the spring of 2015. A public hearing on the proposed change was held on
Tuesday, October 7, 2014. The hearing was recorded and a summary report is available for review.

CHARTER EVALUATION: After receiving the charter renewal proposal, the Portfolio Of?ce conducted a
comprehensive evaluation of Chicago International Charter School?s performance and operations. This
evaluation included a review of the proposal, facilities surveys, ?nancial analysis, and academic site visits
of the Avalon.I South Shore, Basil, Bucktown, Lloyd Bond, Irving Park, Longwood, Prairie, Ralph Ellison
and West Belden campuses in which teaching and Ieaming, leadership and governance, and learning
communities were assessed. A public hearing was conducted on Thursday, March 22, 2012 to receive
public comments on the application to renew the Charter School Agreement with the Chicago Charter
School Foundation for an additional ?ve years. In addition, the Portfolio Of?ce evaluated the school's
student performance. From 2007-2008 to 2009-2010, Chicago international Charter School campuses
received 21 of 50 high ratings, 21 of 50 middie ratings, and 8 of 50 low ratings. From 2007-2008 to 2009-
2011, student attendance averaged approximately 94.0%. In 2010-2011, 23.5% of CICS students
met or exceeded state standards on the PSAE Composite, a decrease of 7.3 percentage points from
2007-2008. In 2010-2011, the percentage of students meetinglexceeding state standards on the ISAT
Composite was 76.8%, an increase of 4.4 percentage points from 2007-2008. in 2011, CECS was rated a
Level 2 school at the high school level and a Level 2 school at the elementary school level, in accordance
with the Performance, Remediation, and Probation Policy, the most recent framework put forth by the
district for assessing charter pupii performance. The committee recommends that, based on the school's
performance on these and other accountability criteria, Chicago International Charter School be
authorized to continue operating as a charter school.

extended for a ?ve (5) year term commencing July 1, 2012 and ending June 30, 2017.

?base case? of Board Pay-For?Success Payments is not the appropriate basis for a Board Budget
request for any Project Year, the Board may propose an alternate basis to the Evaluator. If the
Evaluator approves such alternate basis, the Board?s request for inclusion in the Board Budget for
the then~applicable ?scal period may be based on such alternate basis.

Further, the Board covenants that, to the extent it requests an inclusion in the Board
Budget for the then applicable ?scal period ?mds for any early childhood program (de?ned for
purposes hereof to mean any program for children prior to entering kindergarten), the Board will
seek a request for Board Pay-For?Success Payments, determined in accordance with the preceding
paragraph, due with respect to the preceding Project Year or due and unpaid for prior Project Years
in accordance with the provisions-of Article Two, this Article Four and the Pay For Success
Agreement.

If the actual Board Pay?For?Success Payments owed by the Board for a particular
Project Year are more than the amount included in the Board Budget for that Project Year, the
Board shall request an amount equal to the de?ciency in the Board Budget for the subsequent
Project Year.

Unless the Board has received notice from the Project Coordinator that no further
amounts are due and payable under the Loan Agreements and no further Board Pay?For-Success
Payments are due from the Board hereunder as a result, the Board covenants to continue to make

such budget requests until the later of the Project Year after the Project Year in which the last
Project Year Cohort completes twelfth (12?1 grade or (ii) all Board Pay for-Success Payments
required hereby have been paid 1n full.

Upon the approval by the Board of any funds requested by the Board to pay Board
Pay-For?Success Payments for any Project Year (the ?Board Budgeted Pay-?tr?Success undy 
the Board covenants to cause such Board Budgeted Pay?For-Success Funds to be deposited in the
Board Designated Account in accordance with the provisions of this Article Four and the Pay For
Success Agreement. If any ?nal budget of the Board for any Project Year does not include the full
amount of the Board Pay?For?Success Payments requested by the CPS Chief Financial Of?cer for
such year, then upon the adbption of such ?nal budget, the Board shall give notice to the
City and the Lenders to such effect.

2. Board Pay-For?Success Payments. Commencing with the Project Year ending on
June 30, 2016 and ending with the last Project Year in which a Project Year Cohort completes
sixth (6th) grade, the Evaluator shall calculate, pursuant to the Evaluation Plan, the amount, if any,
of Board Pay?For~Success Payments due from the Board for such Project Year in accordance with
the Evaluation Plan. By the October 1 following the completion of each Project Year under
evaluation, the Evaluator shall deliver written notice of such amount (including the calculations
supporting such amount) to the City, the Board, the Project Coordinator and the Lenders. The
Evaluator?s calculations delivered for each Project Year Cohort completing sixth (6th) grade will
also include the amounts of Board Pay-For?Success Payments due for each of the following six
Subsequent Project Years for such Project Year Cohort.

If for any Project Year no such notice is received by the Board from the Evaluator by
October 15 of the following Project Year, then the Board shall notify the City, the Project
Coordinator and the Lender Committee of such failure, and the Project Coordinator shall replace
the Evaluator as as practicable, subject to the approval of the City and the Board and the
Approval of the Lender Committee.

The Board Pay?For?Success Payments will be due 30 Business Days after receipt of the
Evaluator?s notice of any Board Pay-For?Success Payments (other than Board Pay-For-Success
Payments due for Project Year Cohorts in grades beyond sixth (6th) grade, which are due by the
September 1 following each Project Year for which payment is due), and the Board shall, on behalf
of the City, deposit such Board Pay?For?Success Payments in the Board Designated Account;
provided, however, that if the Board shall determine, within ten (10) Business Days of receipt of
notice from the Evaluator, that the calculation of the amounts set forth by the Evaluator contains
any manifest mathematical error, the Board shall give notice describing such error to the
Evaluator, the City, the Project Coordinator and the Lenders, and each of such parties will work in
good faith to resolve the error (and upOn such resolution the Board shall pay the required
amount as so resolved).

Unless the Board has received notice from the Project Coordinator that no further amounts
are due and payable under the Loan Agreements and no further Board Pay?For?Success Payments
are due from the Board hereunder as a result, the Board covenants to make such required Board
Pay-For?Success Payments until the later of the Project Year after the sixth anniversary of the
Project Year the last Project Year Cohort completes sixth (6th) grade or (ii) the Board
Pay-For-Success Payments required hereby have been paid in hill.

3. Limit on Board Pav?For?Success Payments. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement or any other Core Document, the maximum aggregate amount of Board
Payments that are required to be made pursuant to and during the term of this
Agreement is $30,000,000, and the City shall cause all Board Pay-For-Success Payments to be
paid to the Project Coordinator solely and only from funds paid to it by the Board hereunder or
(ii) other amounts legally available to be applied to such payments as expressly provided herein.

4. Prepayment. The Board shall have the right, but not the obligation, to prepay any
portion or all of the Board Pay?For-Success Payments at any time. If the Board wishes to prepay
any portion or all of the Board Pay-For?Success Payments, the Board shall, by notice to the
Evaluator with copies to the City, the Project Coordinator and the Lenders, request the Evaluator to
calculate the amount of Board Pay+For?Success Payments to be prepaid. With respect to Board
Pay-For Success Payments deposited in the Board Designated Account to pay the GSSIF Senior
Lender or the NT Senior Lender, the prepayment amount will be an amount equal to the
outstanding principal amount of the Loans due to the respective Lender under the respective Loan
Agreement on the date of prepayment, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon. With respect to
Board Pay?For-Success Payments deposited in the Board Designated Account to pay the
Subordinate Lender, the prepayment amount will be an amount equal to the present value of the
outstanding and unpaid Board Pay-For-Success Payments assuming a ?base case? level of Board
Pawaor-Success Payments discounted to present value as of the date of notice of prepayment (the
?Calculation Date?) using a discount rate equal to the Treasury Rate (as de?ned below) plus 200
basis points. For purposes of this calculation described in the preceding sentence, ?Treasury Rate?
means, as of any Calculation date, the yield to maturity as of such prepayment date of United
States Treasury securities with a constant maturity (as compiled and published in the most recent
Federal Reserve Statistical ReleaSe H.15 (519) that has become publicly available at least two

234

October 22, 2014

Business Days prior to the Calculation Date (excluding in?ation indexed securities (or, if such
Statistical Release is no longer published, any publicly available source of similar market data))
most nearly equal to the period from the Calculation Date to the payment dates of the Board
Pay-For-Success Payments to be prepaid; provided, however, that if the period from the
Caluclation Date to such prepayment date is less than one year, the weekly average yield on actual
traded United States Treasury securities adjusted to a constant maturity of one year will be used.
Upon the giving by the Evaluator of notice to the Board, the City, the Project Coordinator and the
Lenders of the amount to be prepaid by the Board as so calculated, the Board shall deposit the
amount of the prepayment as so calculated by the Evaluator to the Board Designed Account.

5. Acceleration. The Board covenants to pay any Board Pay-For?Success Payments
resulting from the acceleration on September 1, 2028 (the ?Acceleration Date by any Lender of
the outstanding amount of its respective Loan pursuant to Section 2.6.7 of the applicable Loan
Agreement following receipt of notice ?om such Lender of such acceleration, which notice from
such Lender must be sent 90 days prior to the Acceleration Date. The discount rate to be used in
calculating the present value of the Board Pay?For?Success Payments as of the Acceleration Date
shall be the discount rate set forth in Article 4, Section 4 hereof for voluntary prepayments of
Board Pay-For?Success Payments. The Board?s obligation to pay any accelerated Board
Pay-FonSuccess Payments is subject to budgeted amounts being legally available to make such
Board Pay-For-Success Payments. In the event that such amounts are not legally available, the
provisions of Article 7 Section 2 hereof shall apply.

 

6. Limitations. The obligation of the Board to fund Board Pay?ForuSuccess Payments
or to make any other payments required by this Agreement shall not constitute an indebtedness or
general obligation of the Board or a loan of its credit within the meaning of any statutory or
Constitutional provision of the State.

Board may, by notice to the City, the Project Coordinator and the Lenders, terminate this

INTRODUCTION AND STUDY OBJECTIVES

The purpose of this document is to describe the methodology to be used to evaluate the impact of
the Child Parent Center (CPC) Social Impact Bond (SIB) expansion on three primary impact
outcomes: Special Education Utilization, Kindergarten Readiness, and Third Grade Literacy.
This document also describes additional research questions that the Evaluator will seek to
explore in collaboration with CPS to help the CPCs improve their performance. This
methodology will be developed in conjunction with CPS and other experts in the early education
?eld.

Participants in the CPC program (the Treatment Group) will be compared to groups of matched
comparison students who did not have a CPC experience through the use of a propensity score
matching algorithm. One comparison group will consist of children who did not attend any form
of CPS Pre-K (No PrenK comparison group). Another group will consist of children who
attended some other type of CPS pre-K program, such as Head Start or Pre-School for All (Other
Pre-K comparison group).

Payments based on Special Education utilization for the SIB project will be calculated using the
difference in outcomes between the. Treatment group and the No Pre?K comparison group.

Payments based on Kindergarten Readiness and Third Grade literacy will be calculated using
outcomes of the treatment group relative to national standards

The Other CPS Pre?K comparison group will be used for sensitivity analyses and for addressing
other research questions not related to payment triggers.

For the purposes of calculating payments owed as part of the SIB transaction, impacts will
estimated using the total population of eligible students at SIB CPC sites, and then sealed to I
re?ect the actual number of seats funded by the Lenders. We will adjust the scaling factors
annually to re?ect observed mobility trends.

The primary impact outcome questions are as follows:

1. What is the impact of the CPC program on the rate at which students need an 

2. What is the impact of the CPC program on Kindergarten Readiness as de?ned by
performance on the TS Gold instrument (completed by teachers at the end of preschool)?

3. What IS the impact of the CPC program on Third Grade literacy as de?ned by
performance on the CPS 3rd grade assessment?

In addition to these impact outcome questions, this evaluation will also seek to answer
qualitative research questions that will help improve the performance of the program going
forward unrelated to the Pay for Success calculations. These research questions will be
developed more fully in conjunction with CPS and other experts in the early education ?eld, and
will only be pursued subject to additional external funding. The questiOns may include:

1. How do the primary impact outcomes vary by key subgroups, including gender, race,
prior pre-school attendance, English language learner status, and potentially other
subgroups?

2. How is the CPC program impacting attendance in Pre?K? How does attendance vary by
site? How does attendance vary compare to other CPS Pre?K programs? Are there
policies in place at speci?c sites that could be driving improved attendance?

3. How does the CPC program support a transition to Kindergarten? What sites are better at
retaining children from Pre?K to K, both within their host school and within the entire
district? Where do children who transfer within CPS go and why? Are there different
impact outcomes for students who have less mobility?

256

October 22, 2014

4. How successful is the CPC program at improving social-emotional learning outcomes
(de?ned by the social-emotional components of the TS Gold instrument) compared to
children enrolled in other CPS pre-K programs?

5. How successful is the CPC model at engaging parents? What strategies are the most
effective at encouraging parental engagement? What strategies appear to have the
greatest impact on children?s outcomes?

This document will serve as a template for how the evaluation will be conducted. The Evaluator
will draft a ?nal Evaluation Plan to be approved by CPS, the City, the Project Coordinator with
Approval of the Lender Committee (such term being de?ned herein as such term is de?ned in the
Loan Documents of the Lenders) using this doeument as a framework. No changes to payment
terms or payment terminology will be made.

STUDY POPULATION

Eligible Population Treatment Group

The Treatment Group in this study will consist of four-year?olds1 who are attending Pre-K at any
of the CPC SIB sites, in full day or half day programs, who at any point during the school year
are eligible for the National School Lunch Program (N SLP).

In the ?rst year of the program, the following sites will be considered CPC SIB sites:

0 De Diego

a Melody

- Peck

0 Thomas

0 Wadsworth

- Hanson Park

In the second year of the program, two additional sites, identi?ed by CPS and approved by the
City, will be added to the list of CPC SIB sites in addition to the sites listed above. If SIB
funding in ?iture years is uscd to add classrooms at additional schools as part of this project,
those schools can be considered CPC SIB sites as well. If SIB funding is removed from one of
the above sites, that site will no longer be considered a CPC SIB site.

A child may enter the program based on CPS age elibility criteria. For the 2014/15 school year,
this entailed being age 4 as of September 

All four?year?olds at CPC SIB sites, including children attending full?day classes, will be
included in the treatment group, subject to the eXClusions listed below.

In the ?rst year of the program, we anticipate that 374 new slots for four-year?olds will be
created through the SIB program. In the second year of the program, we anticipate that we will
create an additional 408 new slots for four-year?olds in addition to maintaining funding for the
original 374. In the third year of the program, we anticipate that we will maintain the 782 new
slots that were created in years one and two. In the fourth year of the project, we expect to
provide funding for at least 680 slots. Overall at CPC SIB sites, we anticipate that appr0ximately
840 four-year?olds will be served per year once the program is operating at scale, with 782 of
those positions funded by the SIB. The new slot. amounts will be ?nalized prior to the launch of
each new cohort. I 

 

I The intention is to identify children in the ?age cycle four? year the war prior to when they are planning to attend Kindergarten. A1 the time of
the dra?ing of this document, this was de?ned by CPS as attaining age four on or before September 151. This age identi?cation protocol may be
adapted as necessary to capture these children.

257

October 22, 2014

Year 1 contingency for CPC Treatment Gmup
Due to the timing of the contracting, some of the new classrooms to be added in the 2014/15

school year will not be ready to serve children until the school year has already begun. Five of
the Year 1 CPC SIB Sites where we will be adding additional classrooms (De Diego, Melody,
Peck, Thomas, and Wadsworth) have been operating as a CPC for a year or more. As a result,

they have an established leadership team, trained and experienced teachers, and fully out?tted

classrooms.

To ensure that the children being tracked are receiving a suf?cient dosage of the CPC program,
for Year 1 only we will restrict the Treatment group eligibility to children who are enrolled in
one of these ?ve established CPC SIB sites, in a classroom that was already established as of
September 2nd 2014 (the start of the 2014/15 school year). CPS will proceed with opening the
new classrooms once all contractual issues have been resolved, but the children who are enrolled
in those classrooms (including children at Hanson Park, the new CPC for Year 1) will not be
included in the outcome calculations for the purposes of determining payments. This will allow
CPS leeway to identify and train high quality teachers, and mitigate the risk that the outcomes
(or underlying characteristics) of children who enroll in a CPC Pre-K a?er the start of the year
are different from those of their peers who enrolled at the start of the year. The outcomes of these
late-enrollees can be used as a unique sub?group, but will not factor into any calculations that
determine payment amounts.

It is anticipated that the sample size of eligible fourayearnolds in existing classrooms at existing
CPC SIB sites will be at least 300 students. As with future analyses, when calculating payments
this number will be scaled to re?ect the actual number of slots funded by the Lenders as part of
this initiative.

Eligible Ponulation - No PrerK Comparison Group
The No Pre?K Comparison Group in this study will be identi?ed via a pr0pensity score matching
algorithm that pulls from a p00] of eligible No Pre?K children districtwide. The pool of eligible
No Pre?K children will include all children who meet the following criteria:
a Are enrolled in a CPS Kindergarten program, excluding:
0 Charter schools
0 Schools currently operating a CPC, as part of the SIB program or otherwise
0 Magnet and Selective Enrollment Schools
0 Schools that serve exclusively a Special education p0pulation
Are ?ve years of age as of September 15t
0 Did not attend a CPS Pre?K program in the school year prior to beginning Kindergarten
0 Did not attend a Head Start program funded through the City of Chicago
0 Are eligible for NSLP at any point during the school year

A child will be considered to have attended a Pre-K program if that child attended 10 days or
more of a city ?rnded pre-school program, or any days at any CPC site over the course of the
school year. Days need not have been attended consecutively.

The No Pre?K Comparison group will be identi?ed the year that their matched Treatment cohort
begins Kindergarten to ensure that children within both groups are on the same age cycle.

Eligible Population Other CPS Pre-K Comparison Group
The Other CPS Pre-K Comparison Group in this study will be identi?ed via a propensity score
matching algorithm that pulls from a pool of eligible children who attended other forms of CPS
pre-K within the district. The pool of eligible Other CPS Pre-K children will include children
who meet the following criteria:
0 Are enrolled in a CPS Pre-K program, excluding:
0 Charter schools
0 Schools currently operating a CPC, as part of the SIB program or otherwise

258

October 22, 2014

Magnet and Selective Enrollment Schools

0 Schools that serve exclusively a special education population
I Are four years of age as of September 15?.
I Are eligible for NSLP at any point during the school year

The Other CPS Pre-K Comparison group will be identified the same year that their matched
Treatment cohort begins pre-school to ensure that children within both groups are on the same
age cycle. This group will only be identi?ed subject to available external funding

Exclusions for payment calculations

The hypothesis is that the CPC pmgram will have the biggest impact on children who are
deemed at risk for poor school performance and achievement, but who lack a severe or
signi?cant disability. Without additional support, many of these children may end up being
diagnosed with a mild learning disability, emotional disturbance, or deve10pmental delay
(including Speech/language impairment). For these children, additional support in the classroom
and at home can help ensure that they stay on track developmentally with their peers, avoiding
the need for years of special education services.

The same impact is not expected for children with severe disabilities (identi?ed in preschool or
at a later date), and it is also not expected that a preschool intervention would meet the needs of
the child without the bene?t special education services, nor would that be appropriate or within
the parameters of a child?s right to a free and appropriate education. To ensure that children have
access to the supports they need based on a clinical evaluation, if a child at any point during the
course of the study is diagnosed with a severe disability, he or she will be removed from the
study group during the year that the disability is added to the child?s IEP onward. The
preliminary list of severe disabilities, with input from the Independent Evaluator, may be as

follows:
I autism

INTERVENTION AND OUTCOMES

De?ning the Intervention
The CPC SIB intervention will provide one year of half?day CPC Pre?K to four-year-olds at CPC

SIB sites. The key components of the CPC model are as follows:

Effective Learning Experiences

0 Offer Pre-K classes that are limited to 34 children for halfuday classrooms (two sessions
of 17 children each) and have a minimum of 2 teaching staff. Full day classrooms, if
available, will be limited to 20 children per session.

0 Provide highly quali?ed educational staff that will provide the classroom insnuction and
parent engagement activities. For example, classroom teachers are certi?ed with a
bachelor?s degree (or higher). Overall, program staff must adhere to the requirements set
forth by the CPS Talent of?ce, in accordance with collective bargaining unit agreements,
and state regulations. Any changes in CPS education and certi?cation requirements will
be complied with.

0 Use data to drive instruction by effectively documenting the organization and
implementation of instructional practices to monitor quality and adherence to the
Program, which is completed by all Program staff where appr0priate.

. Program staff meet with parents over the course of each school year to review their
child?s progress and discuss parent program opportunities with the Parent Resource
Teacher (PRT). 

Aligned Curriculum

. Implement a CPS District curriculum and formative assessment that is aligned to
standards, domains of learning, assessments, and learning activities.

- Collaborate with the PRT and classroom teachers to ensure that opportunities to engage
families in student learning are available, appropriate and aligned to the program and
parents? needs.

0 CPS and, most speci?cally, the Of?ce of Early Childhood Education provides
meaningful professional deveIOpment and ongoing coaching and feedback for teachers,
aides, and other staff members that facilitates high-quality instructional practices.

Parent In volvement and Engagement

- Engage a PRT and School-Community Representative (SCR) to work closely with the
Head Teacher and Liaisons to maintain a consistently supportive parent program.

0 Encourage parents to sign a CPC school?home agreement at the start of the school year
outlining a plan for fostering learning at home and participating in CPC activities.

0 Offer and engage families in activities. PRTs create and distribute a 
parent involvement calendar, and conduct parent/teacher conferences over the year to
review progress in the parent program.

0 Provide a resource room dedicated to parent and family activities through Kindergarten
when possible.

261

October 22, 2014

0 Provide culturally responsive learning opportunities for families that provide ?exibility
for families? needs and schedules.

Collaborative Leadership Team

- Engage a Program leadership team that includes the Head Teacher, Parent Resource
Teacher, and School?Community Representative.

0 Meet regularly, under the direction of the Principal to discuss operations and best
practices within the CPC.

I Meet regularly, under the direction of the OECE Management Team, with staff from
across sites to share challenges, experiences, and best practices and makes frequent on-
site visits to monitor quality and effectiveness to the Program.

. Establish meaningful partnerships with community providers to strengthen service
delivery and enlist local universities in training opportlmities. 

Continuity and Stability

- CPC Pre-K classrooms are co?located in the same building as Kindergarten classrooms,
when possible, to promote familiarity and integration for students as they transition to
Kindergarten.

0 Provide a structure of communication, planning, and joint activities, under the directiOn
of the principal, Leadership team and OECE Management Team, from Pre?K through the
primary grades.

Provide a part-time Kindergarten aide when funding is available to support the transition
into Kindergarten.

Professional Development System

0 Offer ongoing professional development opportunities on current trends and needs in
early childhood education classrooms, through the Of?ce of Early Childhood Education
and the CPC leadership teams, including topics such as quality cuniculum and
instruction, data driven instruction, learning environment, social and emotional needs,
and parent engagement. .

0 Meet regularly and create professional learning communities to review ways to support
their instruction in the classroom and with other teachers.

De?ning Suf?cient Dosage
Enrollment and attendance ?uctuate throughout the year, with substantial changes during the

early weeks of the school year. As a result, some of the children who start the year in a given
classroom may not be the same children who end the year in that classroom. This may be due to
for a variety of reasons such as mobility, a change in parents? schedules/ability to bring their
children to school, or admission to a closer/more desirable program off of a waitlist later in the
school year.

To ensure that CPC SIB children and families are receiving a minimum suf?cient dosage of the
CPC program, we will restrict analyses to children who attend a certain minimum cutoff of days.
The Evaluator will examine historical data from CPS and other districts to determine trends in
attendance and identify a cutoff that suf?ciently indicates that a child has received enough of the
program for us to expect to see an impact. We are temporarily placing this cutoff at 66% of
school days in a given school year; children who attended fewer than 66% of days during their
Pre-K year will be omittedfrom the primary analyses. 7

The Evaluator may add additional criteria based on an analysis of enrolhnent and attendance
data with the approval of CPS, the City, and the Project Coordinator and Approval of the Lender
Committee.

Similarly, for the No Pro?K Comparison group, we will limit the primary analysis sample to
eligible No Pre-K children who attend at least 66% of school days in a given school year. If a
child at any point during the Kindergarten year attends a school Operating a CPC program, that
child will be omitted from primary analyses.

262

De?ning Primary Impact Outcomes

Special Education Utilization

The primary Special Education utilization outcome will be de?ned as a binary indicator of
whether or not a student has a CPS~issued Individualized Education Plan (IEP) in a given year.
This will be a data point previded as part of the regular data collection points by CPS. As
described above, if a student has a diagnosis severe disability, that student
will be removed from the study pool for the primary analyses. This indicator will be collected
annually ever year Kindergarten through 6th grade.

Kindergarten Readiness

CPS uses the Teaching Strategies Gold (TS Gold) instrument in all their Pre-K classrooms to
track the develOprnent of children. Based on teacher observations, TS Gold measures the
progress of children in domains such as socio?emotional, physical, language, literacy, and
cognitive development.

The TS Gold instrument is utilized nationally in Head Start programs and some publicly-?mded
preschool programs. The primary outcome metric for Kindergarten Readiness will be the share
of children which are performing at or above the national trends across at least ?ve out of the
following six domains: Literacy, Language, Math, Cognitive DeveIOpment, Socio~Emotional,
Physical health. 

Third Grade Literacy

Currently, CPS is planning to ad0pt the PARCC standardized exam. Treatment group children
will be measured relative to national percentile rankings on this test or the accepted District
assessment administered for 3rd grade. In following with Lesnick et al (2010)4, every child
reading at or above the 25"1 percentile on the English Language Arts/Literacy portion of the
spring sitting of the PARCC test will be deemed to be reading at grade level. Any child reading
at or above the 75m percentile nationally will be deemed to be reading above grade level- Any
child reading below the 25th percentile will be deemed to be reading below grade level.

At the time of drafting this analysis, the PARCC test has yet to be of?cially implemented in CPS
schools. Given the uncertainty of performance on this test and how its outcomes will compare to
past tests taken by CPS students, the evaluator may suggest amendments to the de?nition of
reading ?on grade level? that could include utilizing a different test or metric. Any modi?cations
must be made prior to the first cohort starting Third Grade, and must be approved by CPS, the
City, the Project Coordinator, and Approved by the Lender Committee.

De?ning Performance Improvement Questions

The details of these questions will be deve10ped in conjunction with CPS and other partners over
the 2014/15 school year. These analyses will be Speci?ed in ?ill prior to the start of any data
collection or analyses. These analyses will not affect the methodology or results of the primary
impact outcomes, and will only be pursued subject to additional philanthropic or other funding.

DATA COLLECTION

Student data

Student data will be provided to the Evaluator by CPS. Pursuant to the data sharing agreements,
CPS will strip sensitive individual identi?ers and replace them with an anonymous student ID.
The key variables CPS will provide are:

Student ID

CPS School ID of school currently enrolled in

Date of Birth (or birth month year)

Days attended to date 

IEP status

IEP diagnoses

Reported race

Reported ethnicity

Free/reduced price lunch eligibility

 

4 See 

5 This data sharing agreement will be included as an appendix to this plan pending negotiation and drafting between
CPS and the Evaluator.

263

October 22, 2014

ZIP code of residence

Fall and Spring TS Gold scores (if applicable)

Any available variables on parental cducatiou

Other variables deemed appropriate by the Evaluator and CPS for the purposes of
creating a better propensity score match

Data will be collected on an annual basis on the based on the last school day in June which is
reported for accuracy in the beginning of July. This may be adjusted based on discussions
between the Evaluator and CPS to re?ect the earliest date that all the necessary data would be
available.

Neighborhood data
The Evaluator will pull neighborhood data from publicly available census data, such as the

American Community Survey 5?year averages, which break out characteristics by zip code.
Neighborhood data include:
0 Neighborhood of p0pulation in poverty
- Neighborhood of population that are single mothers
Neighborhood of pepulation that is Black
Neighborhood of population that is Hispanic
Neighborhood of p0pulation employed
Neighborhood crime statistics
Neighborhood health indicators6

The Evaluator will update the neighborhood data ?le when creating a new cohort of matched
groups.

Mata
Data on school level characteristics will be provided by CPS, including:
I CPS School ID
0 Total student body population
0 Free/RP lunch
Black
Hispanic
School-wide attendance rate ?om the 2013/14 school year
School Rating (Levels 1, 2, or 3) from the 2013/14 school year7

These data, except for attendance and the school rating, will be updated annually. Attendance
and rating data from SY2013114 (or the closest assessment prior to will remain ?xed
to re?ect the fact that the presence of a CPC may improve attendance and the school rating over
time, which could affect the matching algorithm for later cohorts. The Evaluator may adjust this
protocol if extraneous events such as school closures, new leadership, or expansive new
programs are added at individual schools or system wide that could contribute to imbalanced
matches.

Data Security 
A data sharing agreement between CPS and the Independent Evaluator will de?ne the

parameters for sharing data required under this agreement.
STUDY DESIGN OVERVIEW OF ANALYSES

Propensitv score Matching Protocol

Comparison grOup students will be selected using a propensity score matching technique.
Individuals from the treatment group will be matched to up to two individuals from the No Pre?K
Comparison group and up to M0 individuals from the Other CPS Pre?K Comparison group.
Matching will be conducted with replacement to allow comparison individuals to be matched
more than once.

 

6 Crime stats and health indicators subject to availability of data. It may be possible to pull data from a Chapin Hall
neighborhood analysis. These covariates may be omitted if it proves too di?icult or costly to obtain them.

7 All these data are publicly available online at a school/pages/?ndaschoolaspx.

School rating is based on the CPS Performance Policy which is used to rate CPS schools. A Level 1 rating is
?excellent?, a Level 2 rating is ?good? and a Level 3 rating is ?low?.

264

October 22, 2014

To create the Treatment Group in school year t, the Evaluator will receive the data collected on
the last day of June of school year I from CPS of all four?year?olds who attended a SIB CPC in
school year I up to the date of the data collection. The data collected and shared will contain all
the student data elements listed above. After screening for eligibility as described abOVe and
removing ineligible students from the sample, the Evaluator will use students? ZIP codes to
merge on neighborhood data, and students? school le to merge on school characteristics.
Neighborhood data will be collected from a reliable source such as Chapin Hall. This will create
a de-identi?ed student-level ?le that contains student-level characteristics, characteristics of that
student?s neighborhood of residence, and characteristics of that student?s school.

To create the No CPS Pre-K pool to be used for matching to the Treatment cohort in school year
t, the Evaluator will receive a data dump on the last day of June of school year 1+1 from CPS of
all ?ve or six?year?olds who attendeda CPS Kindergarten in school year 1+1 up to the date of the
data dump. The data dump will contain all the student data elements listed above. A?er
screening for eligibility as described above and removing ineligible students from the sample, the
Evaluator will use ZIP code data to merge on neighborhood data, and school 1D data to merge on
school characteristics.

To create the Other CPS Pre?K pool to be used fOr matching to the Treatment cohort in school
year t, the Evaluator will receive a data dump on the last day of June of school year from CPS
of all four-year olds who attended a CPS Pre?K program other than CPC in school year I up to
the date of the data dump. The data dump will contain all the student data elements listed above.
After screening for eligibility as described above and removing ineligible students from the
sample, the Evaluator will use ZIP code data to merge on neighborhood data, and school data
to merge on school characteristics.

To create the matched No Pre-K Comparison group, the Evaluator will append the Treatment
Group dataset and the No Pre?K Comparison pool dataset, creating an indicator to identify which
children are members of the Treatment group. The Evaluator will then run a probit model using
the treatment indicator as the dependent variable and the following variables as independent
variables:
0 Race binary indicators
Ethnicity binary indicators
Gender (?Male? binary indicator)
Parental education (subject to availability)
Language spoken at home binaries
Neighborhood poverty
Neighborhood single mothers
Neighborhood by race
Neighborhood by ethnicity
Neighborhood employed
Neighborhood crime rates (subject to availability)
Neighborhood health indicators (subject to availability)
Total student population of school currently attending
Free/RP lunch at school currently attending
Racial composition of school currently attending
- Ethnicity composition of school currently attending
0 School?wide attendance rate from the 2013/14 school year
a School Rating binaries from the 2013/14 school year

Using the results of this model, the Evaluator will predict a propensity score based on a student?s
observed characteristics. This score effectively represents the likelihood that a child, given his
individual, neighborhOOd, and school level characteristics, would be in the Treatment group.

The Evaluator will use a nearest-neighbor matching algorithm8 to identify the two closest
matches based on propensity score for each Treatment group observation, with replacement.

Individuals from either the Treatment group or Comparison pool who are not matched will be
dropped.

 

5? By way of example, see ?nnmatch? smta conunand

265

October 22, 2014

The remaining students from the Comparison pool who were matched will become the No Pre?K
Comparison group for the remainder of the study. Comparison group students will receive a
frequency weight equal to the number of times they were matched. Note that as a result, the
Comparison group should contain approximately two times as many unique individuals as the
Treatment group.

The same protocol will be used to identify the Other CPS Pre-K Comparison group, replacing the
No CPS Pre?K Comparison pool with the Other CPS Pre?K Comparison pool. 

A unique set of comparison groups will be created for each Treatment cohort (see Appendix for a
cohort timing chart).

Checking for covariate balance between groups

Once the comparison groups have been identi?ed, the Evaluator will check for balance between
the groups across matching demographics. The Evaluator will choose appropriate methods to
check for balance, including but not limited to normalized differences and t-tests of mean values
of covariates between groups. If the Evaluator determines that there is imbalance in covariates
between groups, the Evaluator may choose to pursue 3 Matching Methodology Remedy as
described below. The decision to pursue a remedy will be at the discretion of the Evaluator,
taking into account the fact that with many matching variables and a p?value cutoff of .05,
approximately 1 in 20 variables could have a statistically signi?cant difference by random
chance alone. The evaluator will consider the magnitude of the difference and the relative
importance of the unbalanced variable(s) in question, placing particular attention to the
individual?level race and gender indicators, the home language indicators, the neighborhood
poverty indicators, and the school rating indicators.

Matching Methodologv Remedies

In the event that the Evaluator deems that the propensity score matching algorithm has produced
an inadequate match, the Evaluator may make modi?cations to the matching methodology. This
could include introducing a caliper to ensure that certain variables are matched to within a
narrow range (or matched exactly), adding or subtracting additional covariates, increasing or
decreasing the number of matches, or other techniques deemed rigorous and apprOpr-iate by the
Evaluator.

The Evaluator may also explore utilizing a set of comparison schools to limit the comparison
pool. In this methodology, the Evaluator would identify a set of comparison schools that match
the SIB CPC sites, identifying one to three schools for each site. The Evaluator would use a
similar propensity score matching protocol, using school level characteristics, to identify these
schools. From those comparison schools, the Evaluator Would then perform a student-level
propensity score match using a comparable methodology to the one described above. The
Evaluator will then check for covariate balance to see if this produces better match results.

Once the Evaluator identi?es a suitable comparison group that they deem to be well-matched on
covariates, the Evaluator will present the match results, describing any changes that were made
to the matching algorithm, which must be approved by CPS, the City, the Project Coordinator
and Approved by the Lender Committee. The Evaluator should endeavor to use a' similar
matching protocol from year to year. 

Calculating mobility factor
The theory behind the ?nancing component of the SIB project is that providing the upfront

intervention of high quality Pre?K can produce savings to CPS through reduced
Special Education utilization among the students served. For CPS to realize these savings,
however, those students must remain in the CPS school district. If a student leaves the district,
CPS would realize no savings from the fact that the intervention may have helped that that
student catch up to his peers and prevented him from acquiring an IEP.

As a result, the Evaluator will calculate a Mobility Factor for each coh0rt that will represent the

share of the original cohort that is still enrolled in a CPS school in a given year. This will be used
to adjust the payment amounts to better re?ect savings realized by CPS.

266

October 22, 2014

To calculate mobility, every year Kindergarten through 6'11 grade the Evaluator will determine
what share of the original children in a given group from the ?rst year of observation are still
enrolled in any CPS school. To do this, every year the Evaluator will send CPS a list of all the
student IDs of the original group. CPS will match these le to their current enrollment database
to determine which students were enrolled in a CPS school at any point in that school year. CPS
will then return a dataset to the Evaluator indicating which student IDs are enrolled in a CPS
school that year. The Mobility Factor will be de?ned as:

of original students currently enrolled in any CPS school
of students originally enrolled in the group

 

By way of example, assume 500 Treatment group students were identi?ed for the 2014/15
cohort. In the Evaluator sends a list of these student IDs to CPS, who informs the
evaluator that 460 of them are still enrolled at a CPS school. The cumulative mobility for that
year would be 1- 460/500 08. In 6/17, the Evaluator sends the original list of student
IDs to CPS again, who informs the evaluator that 440 of them are still enrolled at a CPS school.
The cumulative mobility for would be 1 440/500? .12.

For grades 7th through 12m, the Evaluator will impute a marginal mobility rate by averaging the
incremental annual increase in the Mobility Factor over the last three years.9 Every year, the
Evaluator will impute a new Mobility Factor based on the average imputed marginal mobility
rate. See Appendix for a full example using hypothetical data.

Calculating effect size for Special Education utilization

To calculate the impact on Special Education utilization, the Evaluator will calculate the Average
Effect Size per Person, which will then be scaled to re?ect the number of seats funded by the
Lenders for the purposes of calculating payments. This will allow the Evaluator to utilize all the
data available, increasing sample sizes and precision of estimates.

To calculate this, the Evaluator will use the following equation:

SPEDTJI

where the Average Effect Size per Person for cohort z' in year t, SPEDCJJ is equal to
the average of a binary indicator of Special Education utilization among the No CPS Pre?K
Comparison group for cohort z' in year and is the average of a binary indicator of
Special Educatiori utilization among the Treatment group for cohort i in year At the discretion
of the Evaluator and with approval from CPS, the City, the Project Coordinator, and the
Approval of the Lender Committee, the Evaluator may regression~adjust this estimate to help
account for any differences in covariates between the Treatment group and the Comparison

group.

Special Education outcomes will be calculated annually every year Kindergarten through 6th
grade. Outcomes will be calculated separately for each cohort. Based on conversations with
special education experts and reviewing existing CPS data, we believe that the vast majority of
children who have a disability will be identified by the end of 6th grade. As a result, after the 6th
grade effect size has been calculated, we will average the effect size over the last three years (4th,
5th and 6th grades) and lock in that average rate for the purposes of calculating payments in
grades 7'th through 12th. This lock-in rate will be calculated separately for each Treatment cohort.
The Evaluator may propose changes to this lock?in methodology in the event that the Evaluator
determines that this methodology produces skewed results. Any modi?cations must be approved
by CPS, the City, the Project Coordinator, and Approved by the Lender Committee.

 

9 The Evaluator may revise the methodology for averaging the mobility rate if they determine that the current
methodology includes a grade breakpoint year that could result in abnormally high mobility out of the district~ This
methodology must be ?nalized before the ?rst cohort reaches 6?11 grade.

267

October 22, 2014

Calculating payments for Special Education utilization
To determine the size of Special Education payments owed in a given year for a given treatment

group cohort, the Evaluator will multiply the Special Education Average Effect Size per Person
for such cohort by the base cohort size multiplied by the 1 minus the cumulative mobility rate for
that year. This will determine the Total Number of Special Education Slots Avoided for a given
cohort in a given year:

Total Number of Special Education Slots Avoided AESPM (1 MEI)

where is the Average Effect Size per Person for cohort i in year t, is the base cohort
size for cohort i, and MF is the cumulative mobility rate for cohort i in year t.

The base cohort sizes are based on the number of seats actually funded by investors. It is
anticipated that the base cohort sizes will be as followsm:

 

 

Cohort Base Cohort
Year Size
2014/15 374
2015/16 782
2016/17 782
2017/18 580

 

 

 

 

The Total Number of Special Education Slots Avoided will then be multiplied by the Annual
Savings Rate to determine the Special Education Payments owed for a given cohort in a given
year. Negative payments will be rounded to zero. The Annual Savings Rate starts at a base of
$9,100 in 2015 and grows 1% annually. The table below provides the rates through 2030:

 

Savings
Year Rate

2015 $9,100
2016 $9,191
2017 $9,283
2018 $9,376
2019 $9,469
2020 $9,564
2021 $9,660
2022 $9,756
2023 $9,354
2024 $9,953
2025 $10,052
2026 $10,153
2027 $10,254
2023 $10,357
2029 $10,460
2030 $10,565

 

 

 

 

 

If applicable, the Special Education Payments from each cohort will be summed to produce the
Total Special Education Payment owed by CPS for that year. These calculations will be reported
to the Project Coordinator for the purposes of triggering payments to the Project Coordinator to
be used to repay the lenders.

Payments for Special Education will be made every year 12thl for each Treatment cohort.

 

1" Note that actual sample sizes used for calculating effect sizes may be larger or smaller than the number of seats
funded.

268

October 22, 2014

Calculating effect size for Kindergarten Readiness
As part of the annual data pull, the Evaluator will receive spring TS Gold scores for Treatment

group students. TS Gold regularly publishes a set of averages that re?ect how children have
scored nationally on TS Gold aSSessment subcategories, broken out by the time of the test and
the age in months of the child. Students will be classi?ed as ?meeting the national norms? for a
sub-category if they score at or above the national mean spring score for that category for
children in their age band.11 The Evaluator will use the most up to date tables available.

Every child who scores at or above the national norm on at least ?ve of the six subcategories in
spring of their four-year?old pre-school year will be deemed ?Kindergarten Ready.? To calculate
the Kindergarten Readiness payment, the Evaluator will calculate the share of the Treatment
group students deemed Kindergarten Ready. The Evaluator will then multiply this number by the
base cohort size, multiplied by cumulative mobility from the Kindergarten year of a given
cohort. This will determine the Total Number of Kindergarten Ready Children for a given
cohort. The Evaluator will then multiply this number by the payment rate of $2,900 to determine
the total Kindergarten Readiness payments owed by the City for that cohort.

Calculating effect size for Third Grade Literggy

CPS is currently transitioning to the PARCC exam. As a result, the exact methodology for
calculating Third Grade Literacy may have to be adapted pending observation of how the test is
being administered, scored, etc. In particular, in the event that data suggests that fewer than 50%
of students are scoring above the :25th percentile, the Evaluator will propose a new protocol or
test for determining Third Grade Literacy that better captures the performance of students. The
Evaluator will pr0pose a ?nal protocol for approval by CPS, the City, and the Project
Coordinator with Approval of the Lender Committee prior to the start of the 2018119 school year
the year the ?rst cohort begins 3rd grade. A draft protocol is below:

As part of the annual data pull, the Evaluator will receive 3rd grade spring PARCC scores for
Treatment group students. The PARCC test is administered nationally, and as a result the
outcomes of Treatment students can be compared to national averages. Students will be
classi?ed as ?reading at or above grade level? if they score at or above the 25th percentile on the
English Language Arts/Literacy portions of the PARCC exam. -

To calculate the Third Grade Literacy payment, the Evaluator will calculate the share of the
Treatment group Students deemed to be reading ?at or above grade level?. The Evaluator will
then multiply this number by the base cohort size, multiplied by cumulative mobility from the
Third Grade year of a given cohort. This will determine the Total Number of Third Grade
Children Reading at Grade Level for a given cohort. The Evaluator will then multiply this
number by the payment rate of $750 to determine the total Third Grade'Literacy payments owed
by the City for that cohort. 

Investigating Higth Unexpected Outcomes-

The results of this evaluation will govern the ?ow of millions of dollars of payments. While it is
the full intention of all parties to accept the results of the evaluation, in the event that a highly
irregular outcome is achieved, a mechanism must be in place to validate the ?ndings and con?rm
that they are due to the impact of the program, and not a ?aw in the analysis or evaluation
design. The Evaluator will have complete discretion to decide if and when a validation of the
?ndings may be necessary, but the following events will serve as guiding principles that could
suggest that a validation may be warranted:

The difference in Special Education Utilization rates between the Treatment group and
No Pre-K comparison group is negative or not statistically different from zero (p?value
for any cohort in any year after Kindergarten

- The No Pre-K comparison group Special Education UtiliZation rate is more than 2.5
times the Treatment group Special Education Utilization rate for any cohort in any year
after Kindergarten

- An irregular pattern from one year to the next in Special Education utilization for a given
group, de?ned as utilization shrinking by more than two percentage points for a given

The Evaluator will determine the appropriate techniques and mechanisms to employ to con?rm
the cause of the irregularity, which could include code, checking for continued
balance in the treatment and comparison groups, and looking for policy changes within speci?c
schools or system-wide that could have affected outcomes.

If the Evaluator ?nds a mechanical error, the results will be recalculated using the correction. If
the Evaluator ?nds a methodological ?aw, the Evaluator may propose a remedy to the evaluation
plan to mitigate the inconsistency in future years. However, the results will not be recalculated
for that year or any other past year. Changes to the plan must be approved by CPS, the City, and
the Project Coordinator, and Approved by the Lender Committee.
