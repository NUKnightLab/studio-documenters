COOK COUNTY MORTGAGE FORECLOSURE MEDIATION PROGRAM
UPDATE. Transmitting a Communication, dated July 22, 2010 from Bridget
Gainer, County Commissioner:
requesting an update on the Cook County Mortgage Foreclosure Mediation
Program from the Honorable Timothy C. Evans, Chief Judge, Circuit Court of Cook
County. The grant activity report was requested by letter on July 21, 2010.

The Honorable Dorothy Kirie Kinnaird, Presiding Judge, Chancery Division, Circuit Court of
Cook County, State of Illinois, delivered an update on the Cook County Mortgage Foreclosure
Mediation Program.
Judge Kinnaird stated the following: Default foreclosure calls have been established. A home
is not taken away from its owner until it is clear that a bank owns the note. The PIN numbers
and addresses are scrutinized, and it is determined whether the affidavits and attorneysâ€™ fees
are appropriate. This is done in all cases regardless of whether a borrower shows up. All of
this has been done consistently since 2002. A comprehensive support system was put into
place in 2003 for foreclosures. In 2003 a Chancery Division Advice Desk was created, which is
staffed by attorneys from the Chicago Legal Clinic. We put together the first Access to Justice
Program in the Circuit Court of Cook County, whereby attorneys are appointed in civil cases to
represent anyone who cannot afford an attorney. In 2008 she put together a comprehensive
advisory group to help put together the Mediation Program, which is now fully up and running.
