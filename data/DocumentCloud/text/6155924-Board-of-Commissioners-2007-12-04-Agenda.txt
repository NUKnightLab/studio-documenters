1982. He was elected Mayor of Chicago in 1983, and re-elected on February 24, 1987, Mayor Harold
Washington presided in office with style and grace, a reformer committed to breaking down barriers and
creating opportunities for all citizens. Mayor Washington was able to find the common threads uniting not
just Chicagoans, but citizens throughout Cook County; and
WHEREAS, as a legislator, he advocated for the passage of the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. holiday in
Illinois, he was a strong supporter of keeping Provident Hospital of Cook County open as a provider of

were many accomplishments in his administration, such as the creation of an Ethics Commission, the
increase in minority business contracts, he encouraged many neighborhood festivals, and lead the
movement toward transparency in government; and
WHEREAS, affectionately known as "the people's mayor" and revered for his many accomplishments in
office, Mayor Harold Washington was equally well-regarded for his strength of character, love of life and

Washington's unique blend of personal warmth, steadfastness, good humor, and the determination to
succeed, made a lasting impression on all the people of Cook County and earned him a special place in
their hearts; and
WHEREAS, Mayor Harold Washington died of a massive heart attack at his desk in City Hall on
November 25, 1987. As we mark the twentieth anniversary of the death of a beloved Mayor, a citizen of

County Board of Commissioners, assembled this fourth day of December 2007, do hereby acknowledge
and pay tribute to the enduring achievements and legacy of Mayor Harold Washington; and

PROPOSED CONTRACT
ITEM #12
WITHDRAWN
Transmitting a Communication from
ROBERT R. SIMON, M.D., Chief, Bureau of Health Services
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with Respiratory Health
Association of Metropolitan Chicago (RHAMC), Chicago, Illinois, (previously named the American
Lung Association of Metropolitan Chicago), for the Bureau of Health Services Smoke Free Lung Health
Programs. This is a 5-year initiative utilizing Cook County tobacco tax dollars to reduce the harmful
impacts of tobacco and asthma on the health of Cook County residents. (See related Item #13).
As Chicago’s lung health leader since 1906, RHAMC is a natural partner for this project. RHAMC has
been actively fighting the asthma and tobacco epidemics within metropolitan Chicago through a wide
range of programmatic efforts. RHAMC has been a leader in the delivery of tobacco cessation services in
the community and training of individuals to deliver tobacco cessation. RHAMC participates in or leads
numerous local asthma initiatives in Cook County, including: Addressing Asthma in Englewood;
Controlling Pediatric Asthma through Collaboration and Education; and the Stakeholders Collaboration to
Improve Student Health.
An estimated 690,000 adults in Cook County over 24 years of age smoke cigarettes, with increased rates
among individuals in the lowest socio-economic strata. Research indicates that cessation programs
directed at smokers in in-patient, out-patient, and community settings are effective in reducing smokingrelated morbidity and mortality, and they are cost-effective because they reduce the burden of tobaccorelated illness upon the community and the County.
The rates of asthma and hospitalizations due to asthma in Cook County and Illinois are reported as nearly
double the national rates, especially among African-American and Puerto Rican communities. National
and local studies have shown improved childhood asthma outcomes can be achieved through education
delivered by health care organizations and Community Health Educators.
Program Outcomes Over 5 Years
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

10,500 tobacco cessation-counseling interventions in Cook County hospitals and 78,000
clinic/community-based tobacco cessation counseling interventions in Cook County clinics or other
community sites.
15,000 new contacts by people calling the Illinois Quitline and subsidized nicotine replacement
therapy for 11,400 people, through the tobacco cessation media campaign.
13,000 smoking quits reported among program participants.
Among Cook County Bureau of Health Services patients, decreased smoking rates, increased quit
attempts, and increased use of aids to cessation (telephone or group counseling and/or medication).
Asthma self-management education to 3,260 individuals with an 80% program completion rate.
Improve self-management skills, environmental changes or avoidance of asthma triggers and
demonstrate decrease in asthma severity.
Decrease hospitalizations and emergency department visits for asthma by 50% among program
participants.

ITEM #25
APPROVED
Transmitting a Communication from
JOHNNY C. BROWN, Chief Operating Officer, Stroger Hospital of Cook County
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with the University of Illinois at
Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, for neuropathologist consulting services for the Department of Pathology.
Reason:

The University of Illinois at Chicago will provide neuropathologist consulting services on a
rotating basis (0.5 FTE) to interpret neuropathology frozen sections during neurosurgical
operative procedures, permanent section analysis and final diagnosis. While these services
are essential in providing the patients with real time diagnostic services, the need for a full
time physician is not required. Placing this service on a contract rather than employing is a
significant savings to the hospital. In addition, this agreement will allow for resident and
fellow training programs in pathology and neurology. The expiration date of the current
contract was November 30, 2007.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $105,000.00. Contract period: December 1, 2007 through November 30, 2008.

APPROVED AS AMENDED
Transmitting a Communication from
MARIA PAPPAS, Cook County Treasurer

requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to extend for one 1 two (2) years, Contract No. 03-42465 with Optical Image Technology, Inc., State College, Pennsylvania, to provide a document
management system (imaging).
Reason:

The request is to continue DocFinity support for the software the Treasurer’s Office uses to
scan and process refund applications and support other critical office processes. Only
DocFinity supports and updates its proprietary software. This will insure this critical software
continues to function as Microsoft patches its operating system software and that critical bugs
are fixed. Not continuing this contract puts the ability of the Treasurer’s Office to process
refunds in a timely manner at risk. The expiration date of the current contract was November
30, 2007.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: None. Contract extension: December 1, 2007 through November 30, 2009.
