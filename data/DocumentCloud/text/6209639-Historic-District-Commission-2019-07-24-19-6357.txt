STAFF REPORT 7/24/2019 MEETING
APPLICATION NUMBER 19-6357
ADDRESS: 2458 BRUSH
HISTORIC DISTRICT: BRUSH PARK
APPLICANT: MONA ROSS-GARDNER
PROPOSAL

PREPARED BY: J. ROSS

The building at 2458 Brush was constructed in 1946 in the Streamline Moderne style. The exterior
has been extensively altered. A long-standing previous establishment was a drycleaner. Exterior
walls are brick at the front elevation and concrete block at the side and rear elevations. The
masonry at the front is unpainted, while side and rear elevations are currently painted. A single
brick chimney (unpainted) tops the building’s flat roof. Windows are aluminum-sash, fixed units.
The building is in a relatively isolated location within the district. It is surrounded by empty lots to
the east, west and north. The Fisher Freeway and associated service drive is to the south.

2458 Brush, note building’s isolated location

 With the current proposal, the applicant is seeking the Commission’s approval to paint signage and
murals on the building. As per the attached proposal, the proposed work includes the following:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Paint 6ft x 3ft cocktail murals on all 4 sides of the unpainted chimney
Paint a 12ft x 20ft sign/ business logo on the south elevation which reads “Brush Street”
Paint a 12ft x 20ft sign/business logo on the north elevation which reads “Brush Street”
Paint a 6ft x 8ft sign/business logo on the concrete block dumpster enclosure which reads
“Brush Street”
Paint a mural at the building’s rear elevation (image and size not provided)
Replace face of existing blade sign with new face which reads “Brush Street Stadium Deli”

STAFF OBSERVATIONS
As noted, the building’s side and rear elevations are currently painted while the chimney is
unpainted. In re: to painting, staff does have the authority to approve the installation of murals and
painted signage (with conditions). However, staff felt it prudent to forward this application to the
Commission for review due to the number of signage/murals which have been proposed. Although
the colors proposed for the murals and signage are generally not neutral/do not present as natural
brick stone colors, it is staff’s opinion that the signage proposed for the walls will not result in the
the removal/alteration of any features or spaces that characterize the district because the building
sits in a relatively isolated location. Also, the proposed painted signage will not result in the
removal of historic materials nor will it alter any features or spaces that characterize the building
because the side and rear elevations are currently painted. However, please note that staff does have
concerns in regard to the proposed addition of murals at the unpainted chimney because, as per the
National Trust, “…modern waterproof sealants, coatings, and paints significantly decrease the
brick’s natural breathability. Water saturation and decreased breathability trap water in the material,
and as the water freezes in the material it expands causing stress cracks and eventually spalling, and
ultimately, failure.”
APPLICABLE ELEMENTS OF DESIGN
(9)
Relationship of colors. Brick red predominates, both in the form of natural color brick and
in the form of painted brick. Other natural brick and stone colors are also present. These
relate to painted woodwork in various colors, and there is an occasional example of stained
woodwork. Roofs of other than asphalt are in natural colors; older slate roofs are often laid
in patterns with various colors of slate. Original color schemes for any given building may
be determined by professional analysis of the paint layers on the building, and when so
determined are always appropriate for that building.
(22)

General environmental character. The environmental character is of an old urban
neighborhood which has undergone, and is undergoing, considerable change. The original
development, reflected in the Victorian period houses, has been altered by the provision of
more intensive residential development in the early twentieth century, the change in
character of Woodward from residential to commercial at about the same time, and a long
period of decline. (Ord. No. 369-H, ' 1, 1-23-80

 RECOMMENDATION
It is the HDC staff’s recommendation that the Commission approve the issuance of a Certificate of
Appropriateness for the project because it meets the Secretary of the Interior’s Standard for
Rehabilitation Standard Number 9) New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction
shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated
from the old and shall be compatible with the massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect
the historic integrity of the property and its environment. However, staff does recommend that the
Commission issue this approval with the following condition:
•

The new painted signage and murals be confined to the painted portion of the building and the
non-historic dumpster enclosure walls
The final proposal shall be submitted to HDC staff for review and approval. If HDC staff determines

that proposal does not conform to the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation
and/or the Elements of Design, staff shall forward the application to the Commission for review at
a monthly meeting.
