GENERAL BACKGROUND
To support the Plan for Transformation and support the process of relocation as CHA families
move into and out of their temporary housing into new permanent housing, the CHA’s
Department of Information Technology Services (“ITS”) developed and implemented
applications based on an Oracle centralized database to provide the CHA with access to reliable
data on a real-time basis to support executive decision making. The CHA developed the CHA
Systems@Work, an Oracle web-based, and security intensive database-like applications. CHA
System@Work includes the Resident Management Tracking System (RMTS) which tracks and

 manages resident data as they move into and out of their temporary housing, or into their new
permanent housing as well as many other applications supporting Service Connectors, Section 8
Housing and other management applications. These applications work in conjunction with the
Oracle database. The Housing Management System (YARDI) provides additional functionality
to support property management activities, and is also provided on the Oracle platform. The
Oracle maintenance and support agreement is necessary to provide access to product
enhancements, upgrades and updates, as well as telephone support from Oracle’s qualified
product technicians to support the CHA’s on-going relocation activities and information
management systems.
In December 2008, The Department of Information Technology Services deployed new
technologies, including Oracle Business Intelligence and Data Warehouse, that will allow the
combination of financial and property data into a single repository, streamlining CHA’s
reporting and analytic environments. The additional software acquisition resulted in additional
incremental software licensing requirements and corresponding increases to the CHA’s
maintenance and support costs.

PROCUREMENT HISTORY
In June of 2001 the Department of Information Technology Services purchased Oracle products
to replace the legacy systems and to be the platform for the CHA Systems@Work. At the time
that the CHA purchased Oracle database system, maintenance costs and services were negotiated
in the agreement and were provided for the first year. Support and maintenance services for the
software products have been continuously provided directly to the CHA from Oracle for each of
the subsequent years since the initial purchase of the database on a sole-source basis. Product
support, enhancements, upgrades and updates are available only from Oracle. As the developer,
licensor and owner of the database software (and the exclusive provider of comprehensive
support and maintenance services), the software maintenance and support services were
originally procured from Oracle on a sole-source basis, on the same prevailing terms and
conditions as have been in effect since the original acquisition of Oracle database software.
In December 2003 the Board authorized the CHA to enter into contract with Oracle Corporation
for Oracle database software support and maintenance services for a one (1) year period in the
amount of $113,630.00. In August 2004 the Board authorized an extension of the software
support and maintenance agreement with Oracle for Oracle database software support and
maintenance services for a two year term, with a one year option for an aggregate the amount
not-to-exceed $340,890.00. In May 2007 the Board authorized an extension of the contract with
Oracle for database software support and maintenance services for 2 year term for an amount
not-to-exceed $237,588.97. In 2008, the CHA determined it would be in its best interest to put
its maintenance and support contract with Oracle on a fiscal year basis and the contract was
extended through December 31, 2010 for an amount not-to exceed $252,058.17, resulting in a
new anniversary date of January 1st, replacing the prior June 17th anniversary date for Oracle
maintenance and support services.

 Due to the recent addition of systems to the CHA technology operations which use the Oracle
software platforms, the Department of Information Technology Services (ITS) is seeking to enter
a one (1) year contract with Oracle Corporation for support and maintenance of the following
technologies: Oracle Database, Primavera, and Oracle Data Warehouse.
Based on the foregoing, it is in the best interest of the Chicago Housing Authority to enter into a
one (1) year contract with Oracle Corporation for the Support and Maintenance services of
Oracle database software, Oracle Business Intelligence software, and Primavera software for the
period of January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2011 in an amount not-to-exceed $225,546.40.
