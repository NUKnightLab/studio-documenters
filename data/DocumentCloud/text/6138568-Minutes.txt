direct ?nancial interest; and

WHEREAS, industrial real estate is normally assessed at 25% of its market value, qualifying industrial real
estate eligible for the Class 8 can receive a signi?cant reduction in the level of assessment from the date that new

substantial re-occupancy. Properties receiving Class 8 will be assessed at 10% of the market value for 10 years,
15% for the 11th year and 20% in the 12th year; and

property is abandoned for purpose of Class 8; and

WHEREAS, in the case of abandonment of less than 24 months and purchase for value, by a purchaser in whom
the seller has no direct ?nancial interest, the County may determine that special circumstances justify ?nding the
property is deemed abandoned; and

WHEREAS, Class 8 requires the validation by the County Board of the shortened period of qualifying
abandonment in cases where the facility has been abandoned for less than 24 consecutive months upon purchase
for value; and

WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners has determined that the building was abandoned for two
(2) months at the time of application, and that special circumstances are present; and

WHEREAS, the applicant estimates that the re-occupancy will create one (1) new full-time jobs and retain

circumstances exist which include the subject property has been vacant for less than 24 months and there has
been a purchase for value; and

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the President and Board of Commissioners of the County of
Cook, State of Illinois, that the President and Board of Commissioners validate the property located at 600 Lake
Street, Maywood, Cook County, Illinois, is deemed abandoned with special circumstances under the Class 8; and
