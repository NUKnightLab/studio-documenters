GENERAL BACKGROUND

As part of Section 3 policy, CHA is required to do business with Section 3 Business
Concerns, which include Resident Owned Businesses. When ful?lling Section 3 goals through
contracting, CHA can contract directly with a Section 3 business or contract with vendors that
subcontract to a Section 3 business. CHA encourages Section 3 Business Concerns (including
Resident Owned Businesses) to apply for contracting opportunities through the competitive
procurement process. The Business Development Program will support commitment to
Section 3 business concerns.

Through the Program, participants will develop the skills necessary to fully execute a business
plan, learn how to network with other business owners. successfully market their business, and
apply for contracting opportunities throughout the city of Chicago and surrounding area. The
Contractor will also provide education and mentoring that further develops and improves
business skills. It is anticipated that 80 residents will participate in this program during the two-
year base term.

Since 2007 the Chicago Urban League has successfully provided business development and
entrepreneurial training for Chicago-land residents. Through the recommended contract, the
Urban League will increase capacity of its existing programs and provide participants with
access to its vast network of available services.

The Board action recommended in this item complies in all material respects with all applicable
Chicago Housing Authority board policies and all applicable federal (HUD) procurement laws.

The acting EVP of Resident Services concurs with the recommendation to enter into a contract
with the Urban League to provide the Program.

The CEO/President recommends the approval to enter into a contract with the Chicago Urban
League to provide a business and entrepreneurship development for CHA residents in an amount
not-to-exceed $801,464 for the period of December 1, 2012 through November 30, 2014.
