The proposal for the new

The Community Action Council led an extensive

7

process where they put forth a proposal for -- at the

8

time it was a $75 million high school.

an investment of $85 million.

It's now become

Once the proposal -- the

10

request for the proposal was submitted to Chicago Public

11

Schools, Chicago Public Schools in June acknowledged the

12

intent to request this new high school for Englewood.

13

This is probably the earliest time in the

14

history of school actions that CPS has acknowledged and

15

started engagement at that early time.

16

Committee was then formed once the proposal was made

17

public.

18

advising CPS on the best transition plan for the

19

existing four high schools, as well as programming and

20

aspects of the new high school.

The Steering

And I do want to acknowledge we have many of the

22

CAC and Steering Committee members here in the audience,

23

as well as the principals of the Englewood high schools.

I want to thank you all for joining us, and I know we

TOOMEY REPORTING

Page 11

also have teachers in the audience, and I really do want

2

to thank you all for joining us.

3

Once the proposal began discussion in the

4

Steering Committee, the Steering Committee had the

5

really challenging task of developing the draft

6

transition plan.

7

this very seriously.

8

conversations, not just around what should the new high

9

school offer but also what would the supports be for the

10

The Steering Committee members took
These were really hard, thoughtful

current Englewood students.

11

The proposals that we really discussed at the

12

table were, is it a possibility to do multi-year

phaseout?

15

Englewood high schools.

Would it be best to close at the end of one

What were really the current state of the four

What happened after a series of additional

17

meetings, we visited all four Englewood high schools and

18

Steering Committee members spoke with students, talked

19

about the educational opportunities at the schools and

20

really thought hard about the impacts of declining

21

enrollment.

22

The declining enrollment at our four Englewood

23

high schools is -- and we'll talk about more about this

24

as well, but it really limits the opportunity within the

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 13, 2018

2

schools.
We brought this back to the Steering Committee

3

and at the end had a vote on two options.

4

close the schools at the end of this year or to continue

5

over two years and close then.

6

vote of the Steering Committee was to close the schools

7

at the end of this school year.

The option to

Ultimately the majority

So the declining enrollment as I discussed, it's
been drastic.

In the last ten years our four schools

10

have gone down between 70 and 85 percent.

11

currently -- Of all of the students who live in the

12

attendance boundaries for the Englewood high schools, 92

13

percent are choosing to travel outside of the community

14

for their high school options.

15

We

That really is the driving force behind the CAC

16

and the Steering Committee decision to request the

17

proposal of the new high school.

18

MR. LAWSON:

Good evening.

Should the Board approve

19

this proposal, the school is scheduled to open in the

20

fall of 2019 with the freshman class only.

21

the first time in a really long time that this sort of

22

investment has been brought to the Englewood community.

23
24

And this is

As Megan talked about just a couple of moments
ago, this is a $85 million investment which is long

4

The school will include brand new education
One is a school-based health clinic for the

Sports facilities, of course, for the students

5

at the school, as well as the broader community, and it

6

would also include a partnership with Kennedy-King that

7

offers early college courses so students have the

8

opportunity to not only attend college while they're in

9

high school but really they can consider additional

10

post-secondary opportunities once they are complete to,

11

of course, make high school a more viable option, to

12

complete faster and cheaper cost.

13

MS. HOUGARD:

As many as you know, when you are a

14

high school student, you are able to attend city college

15

classes at no cost.

16

Kennedy-King means is that our students will be able to

17

earn credits towards associate's degrees but also earn

18

certification.

19

What the partnership with

So Kennedy-King has a wealth of career and

20

technical, we call it vocational, they call it

21

associate's of applied science.

offered while our students are in the proposed new high

23

school.

24

MR. LAWSON:

Those courses will be

So think about the investment that's

1

going to be brought to Englewood.

2

of the four high schools will include an 8.3 million

3

dollar investment over the next three and a half years

4

to support students involved in this transition.

5

thinking about supporting those students, the Steering

6

Committee discussed a number of options to begin in the

7

spring of 2018 beginning with workshops in high school

8

to help parents and students identify school of choice,

9

so rather than push students out to individual schools,

And in

10

they will have the opportunity to choose which schools

11

12

support.

13

Individualized transition plans including

14

academic readiness and safety plans.

15

have the opportunity to sit with coordinators of each of

16

their individual schools to really think around the

17

academic supports that will be offered once they are on

18

their way here in the transition.

19

So students will

Tutoring and academic supports will be provided

20

at each of the receiving schools for students involved

21

in the transition, and there will be increased

22

monitoring of the instructional quality to ensure that

23

students don't fall by the wayside as they transition

24

from their current schools to proposed schools.

TOOMEY REPORTING

specific students.

3

program who's here tonight to have discussion with

4

parents, if necessary, and ODLS has representatives as

5

well for Diverse Learners.

6

So for STLS students we have a SOAR

There will also be additional principal and

7

school-based support to help execute this work.

8

Beginning the summer of 2018, each of the students from

9

the four high schools will have the option -- well, not

10

the option but they will have the option to attend

11

summer academic programs for remediation, as well as

12

have the option to have paid summer jobs.

13

Students will have opportunities during the

14

summer to meet with individuals from their receiving

15

schools as well to, of course, develop relationships

16

prior to their arrival because we know that's a critical

17

piece in thinking around students success.

18

MS. HOUGARD:

Everything that the Steering

19

Committee asked for, honestly is in the transition plan.

20

And the individualized supports for students, as well as

21

individualized planning was really a core piece of the

22

transition and planning.

23

ensure that all students have a choice in this process

24

and parents have a choice in the process.

And the reason is we wanted to

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

And that the

 January 13, 2018
Page 16
1

plan, all of the supports continue until the students

2

graduate.

3

MR. LAWSON:

So as we engage in those very

4

challenging discussions, we talked about what we can do

5

to ensure that students were supported from the time

6

they transitioned through graduation and here is what we

7

heard.

8

cards from now for the next three years.

9

So students will be able to receive free CTA

There will be staged CTA buses and there will

10

also be expansion of the safe passage program to ensure

11

safe travel to and from school.

12

additional academic support, also social, emotional

13

support.

14

Students will receive

So social and emotional supports are for schools

15

that accept transitioning students.

16

large number of students that transition from one school

17

to a receiving school, there is a possibility that

18

positions will follow those students as well and we're

19

looking to identify individuals from their current

20

schools to possibly travel along with them.

21

MS. HOUGARD:

So, if there is a

Good evening.

Good

evening and thank you for allowing me to address you on

behalf of the children of Englewood.

7

first state clearly that I do not support closing four

8

high schools in Englewood or any school in Englewood.

9

But I do support a new school in Englewood because the

10

I would like to

children of Englewood deserve a new school.

11

As an educator in Chicago and a resident of

12

Englewood, I feel there should be a voice for our

children.

school in Englewood, we were excited and cautious.

15

When we heard of the idea to build a new high

We had a meeting with CPS at Robeson High School

16

this past summer and was reassured that the children of

17

the four closing high schools and the teachers would be

18

given a chance to learn and teach in the new high

19

school.

20

Now, we find out that the men that formed this

21

committee of 13 individuals in a secret meeting in

22

September at a location outside of Englewood at 47th and

23

State.

24

This committee subsequently had a meeting with

MS. COLLINS:

It was clear that a collaborative,

2

authentic relationship between the Chicago Public School

3

and the community is imperative for our schools and

4

students to be successful, informed and intentional

5

input for community stakeholders on strategic

6

educational goals and action plans lead to responsible

and sustainable policies, practicing and engagements.

8

The vision of the greater Englewood CAC is to

inform the quality of education in our community

10

ensuring all youth have access to high, quality

11

educational programs and community resources enabling

12

successful transition to post-secondary career

13

development and changing future trajectories.

14

MR. JOHNSON:

Thank you.

Let me just say this one

15

more time.

16

to speak, and we need to give everybody the equity that

17

they deserve.

18

their thoughts continuously, but we need to keep it in a

19

framework so that we're able to hear from everybody.

I'm the proud

There is a somber occasion when we

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 13, 2018
Page 24
1

are thinking or talking in terms of displacing students

2

within our community But what we must do is, we must

3

think about what's in the best interest of our students.

4

So often I tell my staff that we're here, not

5

for our convenience, but we're here to service our

6

students.

7

need to be able to be successful in a very competitive

8

society.

To provide them with what it is that they

So one of the things or two concepts come to

10

mind when I think about this whole situation.

11

meeting that I had years ago at Westinghouse High School

12

where Dr. Janet Johnson was the principal at that time.

13

And I spoke, and I said what is it that we can do as a

14

district to leverage the political capital that we have

15

to form partnerships with the two and four year higher

16

learning institutions to provide our students with slots

17

at their school.

18

This

This is that opportunity.

I heard President Lynch today at Kennedy-King

19

speak to our principals of Network 11 and talk about the

20

fantastic opportunities that are here at Kennedy-King

21

and that the new high school will have access through to

22

through their partnership.

23

That's where our students will have the opportunity to

24

gain or access college credit within the high school

That will come at no cost.

We have schools throughout Chicago that have

3

programs like that but not here in the Englewood

community.

7

That's what I see in this high school.

prepare our students to not only compete within the

community, not only with Chicago, State of Illinois but

10

locally.

Another situation that comes to mind is the

Tremendous high school.

I currently work as the Englewood area director for the

2

Union League Boys & Girls Club.

3

I'd like to start by saying that we all are here

4

because we all have one thing at least in common and

5

that's the love of our kids and our school in this

6

Englewood community.

7

That's the number one thing.

I have a passion for Englewood.

I am for the

8

new school.

9

was my last year of high school when I was going --

Robeson High School when it was built, it

10

attending high school.

11

coming and I can be a part of it, was so exciting for me

12

and my peers that it inspired us.

13

that if we stop looking at the school was closing and

14

this new school opening as shutting out our kids,

15

instead of looking at it as being a beacon of hope and

16

something to strive for excellence with, then we're

17

going to be stuck.

18

And the idea of a new school

And I want to say

We need to make some changes.

We closed some

19

elementary schools.

20

elementary schools are thriving.

21

We have extra support from outside partners, such as the

22

Union League which I represent.

23
24

We closed in Englewood and now our
We have Stem programs.

And everyone here has a strong stake in what's

TOOMEY REPORTING

happening.

2

understand that our kids in the elementary level are

3

being prepared to step into this new school and be

4

prepared to succeed in this new school and prepare to

5

perform and compete on a worldwide range.

6

But we must look toward the future.

We must

If we decide that we really want to do what's

7

best -- and everyone in their heart, believe that

8

they're doing what's best.

9

and try to work on the solution, that we can come out

But if we really sit down

10

with the best solution.

11

forget our kids and how much we love our kids at all

levels.

Good evening.

(inaudible.)

19

Lindblom Math & Science Academy, a couple of blocks

20

away.

21

doesn't take teachers and community reps seriously at

22

these meetings.

I teach seventh grade human geography at

I (inaudible) because I know sometimes CPS

23

I do want to throw out that before I did this, I

24

was a Ph.D. student at the University of Chicago which I

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 13, 2018
Page 30
1

have some decent chops when it comes to social,

2

scientific analysis.

3

want to jump back into my seventh grade class.

4

But enough about that.

I actually

In human geography, we spend a lot of time

5

thinking about the relationship between human beings and

6

their environments.

7

way in which the physical infracture, sometimes the lack

8

of physical infracture in an environment can have a

9

profound effect on the people who live there.

Specifically, we think about the

Not just

10

the people but the social relationships that form

11

between those people's present opportunities and

12

possibilities that are available to those people.

13

Right now we're working on a final project for a

14

semester where students are identifying needs in their

15

communities, and they're coming up with investments and

16

modifications that can make communities to meet those

17

needs.

18

systematically about the problems.

19

My students are very receptive.

They think very

They very quickly came to the conclusion that if

20

you want to help a community meet its needs, first of

21

all, you need the community's involvement, and you need

22

leadership from the community.

23

having that community involvement and that community

24

leadership is that people in the community need to know

But a prerequisite to

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 13, 2018
Page 31
1

each other.

2

They need to have relationships with each other

3

so that they can develop a common analysis of what their

4

problems are, and they can develop a common plan and

5

they have the relationships and the commitments to each

6

other to see that plan through.

7

There are very few institutions in neighborhoods

8

on the south side that build these sorts of

9

relationships between community members like

10

neighborhood schools.

11

By eliminating all of the neighborhood schools

12

in Englewood, you eliminate the institutions that forge

13

these relationships.

14

of a neighborhood that is already struggling.

15

only eliminates the power to solve these challenges, it

16

just destroys relationships.

17

not have a neighborhood high school until the fall of

18

2019.

19

You tear apart the social fabric
It not

Englewood cannot afford to

To close, I want to go to something Dr. Jackson

20

said.

21

the lack of funding, the lack of classes and resources

22

is inhumane.

23

like this.

24

leaving out the fact that this inhumane situation was

She said the current situation in these schools,

It's inhumane to keep students in schools

I agree with her.

But the problem is she is

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 13, 2018
Page 32
1

created by decisions that CPS made.

And kicking students out of

4

Englewood, this is an inhumane solution to an already

5

inhumane problem.

I went to the penitentiary from Englewood.

I

3

want to say Englewood way back there, and I come back to

4

Englewood because I was a liability and now I'm an

5

asset, trying to be an asset to the Englewood community.

6

So I was trying to figure out, how am I going to have my

boys be an asset to the Englewood community, but I

8

didn't find no school.

9

10

Yes, sir.

The first school I went to was

Yes, sir.

But I just wanted to let
