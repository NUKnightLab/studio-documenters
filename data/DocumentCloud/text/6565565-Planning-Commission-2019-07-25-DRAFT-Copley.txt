 Letter to the Residents
Dear Residents,
“It is our goal that the
Comprehensive Land
Use Plan will remain in
place as a live, working
document utilized to guide
the Township in the future
direction of managed and
sustainable growth.”

DRAFT
9/4/2019

The Copley Township Comprehensive Land Use Plan is essential to the success of land use in the Township.
The Land Use Plan is utilized to guide residents, decision-makers and administrative staff in the principles
of responsible land use.

The Plan was first conceptualized in the mid1990’s, approved by the Board of Trustees
in 1999 and redesigned in 2009 by the
Land Use Steering Committee. The Steering
Committee recognized the importance of
managed and responsible growth in an
ever-changing landscape and therefore
implemented a 10-year review for update.
In 2017, The Department of Community
& Economic Development, along with the
Copley Township Zoning Commission, was
charged with managing the 2020 update
with the partnership of local residents,
business owners, elected officials and
decision makers.

Township in the future direction of managed
and sustainable growth.” This growth should
be equitable and beneficial to health and
welfare of all of our residents. It is our desire
that the document will be held in utmost
regard for land use decisions in the Township
and that the document will be updated every
five years to meet the ever-changing needs
and desires of our community.
Sincerely,
Copley Township Zoning Commission

Copley Township’s first Comprehensive Land Use Plan. This Plan was adopted in 1997 and
served the community for ten years. The goals of that plan were to:
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 

Implement the Comprehensive Land Use Plan to direct development in the Township;
Strengthen the Zoning Resolution in its ability to regulate development;
Preserve the rural/suburban atmosphere of Copley Township;
Guide the location of development on the basis of natural capabilities and limitations
of the land;
Ensure that new development does not result in public health hazards for the community;
Guide new growth in an orderly, regulated manner that will minimize stress on services
and public infrastructure;

 Executive Summary
In 2017, the Copley Township Zoning Commission began the process of updating the Comprehensive Land
Use Plan. The Commission wished to address smart growth principles which are aimed to protect and
ensure a high quality of life for residents, businesses and landowners of Copley Township for generations
to come. The purpose of the Comprehensive Land Use Plan is to provide a framework which informs
spending and regulatory decisions to improve the character of the community. Such decisions involve
the proper location and nature of future development; the need for public facilities or infrastructure; and
a determination of scenic, environmental, and historic resources that should be afforded a measure of
protection as development occurs.

Plan Update Overview

The Comprehensive Land Use Plan Update involved the public utilizing a full Public Engagement
Plan. The Plan Update included Stakeholder Meetings, Public Kiosk Stations with Quick Poll Surveys,
Open Office Hours, and a Public Open House. The plan gathered background on the history, cultural

Ind.
R-MD
residential; 9% commercial; 2% industrial;
and 20% agricultural. The remaining land
use is comprised of exempt land, mineral

Exempt land includes land dedicated to
school facilities, government buildings and

 Executive Summary

PLANNING TOOLS

The plan recommends that Copley consider the following tools:

Development Checklist of
Projects

Low Impact Design (LID)
Guidelines

With a Development Checklist as part of the Township development process, a clear and predictable outline can be established. This reduces staff time and resources by having
to request additional information, boards denying applicants
because of lack of information as well as developers better
understanding what is to be expected.

An effective LID approach to land use regulation provides
flexible performance-based goals and design criteria while
promoting opportunities for using innovative management
practices and site planning techniques that can be incorporated
to compensate for development disturbance. Innovative
techniques related to planning and design for stormwater
management; grading, natural resource protection, and site
layout are commonly integrated in low impact development
approaches.

Design Guidelines
An element of the Development Regulations describing those
standards and regulations which directs the appearance of
development and redevelopment projects, site and street
design and seeks to preserve and/or enhance the aesthetic
qualities of an area.

Downzoning

Performance Zoning

DRAFT
9/4/2019

Rezoning of a tract of land to less-dense or intensified uses.
Downzoning is used to curb sprawl and direct growth to
designated areas.

Environmental Zoning

Protecting public health and safety functions that natural
resources provide to the community. Examples of these
include:
◊ Riparian Overlay Districts and Riparian Corridor Setback
Requirements
◊ Wetland Setback Requirements
◊ Groundwater Regulations

Form Based Codes
A Form Based Code is a land development regulation that
fosters predictable built results and a high-quality public
realm by using physical form (rather than separation of uses)
as the organizing principle for the code.

Green Infrastructure
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) refers to
green infrastructure as a cost-effective, resilient approach
to managing wet weather impacts that provides many
community benefits. While single-purpose gray stormwater
infrastructure—conventional piped drainage and water
treatment systems—is designed to move urban stormwater
away from the built environment, green infrastructure
reduces and treats stormwater at its source while delivering
environmental, social, and economic benefits.

Performance Zoning establishes minimum criteria to be used
when assessing whether a particular project is appropriate for
a certain area and ensures that the end result adheres to an
acceptable level of performance or compatibility. This type
of zoning provides flexibility with the well-defined goals and
rules found in conventional zoning. Whereas traditional land
use zoning specifies how land can be used within specified
districts, Performance Zoning specifies the intensity of land
use that is acceptable. In other words, it deals not with the
use of a parcel, but the performance of a parcel and how it
impacts surrounding areas.

Transfer of Development
Rights
TDR tools were designed to encourage conservation of
high value, natural, agricultural, and culturally significant
open space while allowing for higher density residential
and commercial development in the targeted development
corridors or concept areas. TDR tools encourage developers
to relocate development density, reduce densities in
environmentally sensitive areas or reduce density in other
areas desired for low density.
Since 2009, Copley Township has been interested in Transfer
of Development Rights (TDR) as a tool to help shift density
from high priority open space to areas where growth is
encouraged. Current development methods tend to involve
landowners in a process that is not effective in controlling
sprawl. TDR can be a key tool used in shifting density from one
parcel to another. Currently, Townships cannot approve the
transfer of development rights. As a charter county, Summit
County could have the ability to adopt TDR and the Townships
would not have to wait for authorization from the State.
Copley Township could be a pilot TDR program for the County.
In addition, many Township have approved non-contiguous
subdivisions as a methodology of
transferring development densities.

 Executive Summary
The Department of Community & Economic Development recommended the following updates
to the Future Land Use Map based on public engagement, inter-department and external agency
feedback:

 Chapter 1: Plan Overview
“By far the greatest and most admirable form of wisdom is that needed to plan
and beautify cities and human connections.” - Socrates

Introduction & Team Members
In 2017, the Copley Township Zoning Commission began the process of an internal update to the
Comprehensive Land Use Plan. Members of the Zoning Commission were charged with overseeing the update
to the Comprehensive Land Use Plan and approving content provided by the Department of Community &
Economic Development. The Copley Township Comprehensive Land Use Plan Update represents a vision for
overall development in the Township for the next five years.

DRAFT
9/4/2019

The purpose of the Comprehensive Land Use Plan is to provide a framework in which development decisions
are made to determine the future character of the community.
Such decisions involve the proper location and nature of future
development, the need for public facilities or infrastructure,
and a determination of scenic, environmental, and historic
resources that should be afforded a measure of protection as
development occurs. A well-prepared plan should delineate
the implementation mechanisms required to make the plan a
reality.
This Plan represents a long-term vision for community
development and redevelopment. It engaged the community
in thoughtful dialog about the path of community change,
and maps out strategies and initiatives. It is a collective
vision regarding the factors that should be considered when
decisions are made in the future. The Plan provides guidance
to parties that will be interested in developing within the
Township. The existence of an adopted Comprehensive Land
Use Plan provides a valuable basis of legal support when such
decisions are questioned.
First, a substantial effort was made to provide the opportunity
for public involvement in developing the Plan. These efforts
included a Community Engagement Plan utilized throughout
the Township in a series of scheduled Stakeholders Meetings,
Kiosk Community Events, Open Office Hours, Online Surveys
and a Public Open House. Secondly, the 2016 Community
Prospective Survey was utilized as a baseline to provide
general feedback from the community in regards to land use
policies in the Township.

 Chapter 1: Plan Overview
Community Perspective Survey
In 2017, the Township solicited the consulting services of Larry Lallo, MBA CEcD. Larry previously served
as the Executive Director of the Barberton Community Foundation and managed a total asset portfolio of
$90 million. Larry helped guide the Township in the discovery phase of community needs and priorities. A
Community Perspective Survey was used to evaluate strengths, opportunities, challenges, threats and areas
which could be improved. Larry utilized the professional expertise of Dr. Paul Levy, Ph.D. who serves as a
professor and Chair of the University Department of Psychology. Dr. Levy was instrumental in helping design
the Community Perspective Survey in such a way that respondents were not led to certain preconceived
conclusions. A great deal of emphasis was placed on obtaining valid responses. A survey was made available
online as well as paper/pencil and was advertised via social media and other news outlets. Additionally, a
random sample of the five (5) different zip codes within Copley were used to mail 200 paper copies. A total
of 486 surveys were submitted. Of those submitted, a total of 96 paper surveys were returned while 390
were submitted electronically.

DRAFT
9/4/2019

The results were compiled, evaluated, discussed and presented to the public during a February 2, 2017
forum. The public forum was led by Township Administrator, Janice Marshall. Ms. Marshall revealed
the results and provided an opportunity for the public to ask questions and make comments. In total,
approximately 80 individuals attended the public forum.
Results of the survey revealed that the community values the following areas:

General Information

Copley Township is a political subdivision in Summit County, Ohio, located west of the City of Akron, south of Bath Township and the City of Fairlawn, north of the City of Norton, and east of Sharon Township, Medina County. It is a diverse
residential community with agricultural, retail, industrial and commercial areas.

History
Copley Township was part of the Western Reserve Territory.
In 1819, the area, which had been known as “Township 2
range 12”, earlier known as Greenfield, was named Copley.
Copley has long included Montrose, then known as Ellis
Corners or Latta’s Corners, with a long history of business.
The Copley Square area began as a farmers market.
The terrain and geology of Copley Township is primarily a
Sharon conglomerate laid down some 231 million years ago
by glaciers that repeatedly moved into and receded from
the area. Some of the deposits appear to be as recent as
10,000 years ago. Copley swamps with their rich muck
soil have provided abundant nurture for crops of grain,
vegetables and fruit as well as well as for livestock. A high
glacial moraine running east and west through the area is
a watershed sending some waters
north to the Great Lakes while the
rest flows south to the Ohio and
Mississippi rivers.

 Chapter 3: Background
Background

Existing Cultural and Historic Resources

Copley Township is part of the Western Reserve. It was originally heavily forested with significant
wetlands in the eastern and southern sections and was inhabited by Native Americans. The first
settlers were farmers from New England. They cleared the land and cultivated the fertile soils.

Archeological and Historic Sites

According to the National Register of Historic Places,
Copley hosts two different structures which were
awarded with Historic Place Designations. The
Copley Depot and the Cemetery Receiving Vault
were honored with this prestigious designation
after meeting criteria such as historic districts,
sites, buildings, structures, and objects that are
significant in American history, architecture,
archeology, engineering, and culture. The
nominations are then reviewed by the Ohio
Historic Site Preservation Advisory Board, which
includes interested citizens and professionals
(within preservation related fields) appointed by
the governor. The ultimate decision lies with the
National Park Service.

THE COPLEY DEPOT - The Western Railroad (PA&W)
passed through Copley along its route from Delphos to
Mogadore. The line carried passengers, freight and mail.
Later, the Akron Canton and Youngstown Railroad (AC&Y)
took over the route until 1951. In 1974, Copley residents,
formed the Copley Township Historical Society, raised the
funds to acquire the building and moved to its present site
where it now serves as a museum.

THE TOWNSHIP CEMETERY RECEIVING VAULT

Standing in the center of the Copley Township
Cemetery is a Receiving Vault that was built in
1885. Receiving vaults were constructed to serve
as a temporary mortuary to house deceased
persons during winter months because the ground
was frozen and too hard for grave digging. Modern
hydraulic digging machines had not been invented
yet so graves were dug by hand. It also served as a
deterrent to grave robbers. With modern medicine in
its infancy, grave robbing was a common practice to
supply early physicians a steady supply of cadavers
to further anatomical research and teaching. The
introduction of receiving vaults provided a greater
level of protection and peace of mind to families of
the deceased and to the whole community. Most were
constructed of heavy masonry stones and featured
large lockable iron gates to guard
against trespassers. On July 13, 2017
the receiving vault was listed on the
National Register of Historic Places by the
United States Department of the Interior.

 Chapter 3:
Background

Joint Economic Development District JEDD
In 1993, voters of Copley Township approved an agreement with the City of Akron allowing for the formation of the Joint
Economic Development District (JEDD). The purpose of the agreement was to halt annexation of Township land and to
bring needed water and sewer services to residents in “water poor” areas and to property owners desiring to develop
their land for commercial and industrial purposes. Akron’s gains in this agreement were more water/sewer customers
and the ability to collect income taxes from persons employed by companies in JEDD areas. Persons living in Copley,
but not employed in the designated JEDD areas, do not pay the income tax. The Township benefits because the erosion
of the tax base through annexation is halted. In fact some previously annexed areas were returned to the Township
after the approval of the JEDD. In 1993, the JEDD was approved for a period of 100 years with two 50 year extensions.
Amendments to the agreement have occured over the years.

Income Taxes
The original JEDD agreement authorized a collection of the income tax at the same rate paid in the City of Akron,
which was 2%. In 2003, the voters of the City of Akron approved an increase in the income tax to 2.25%. The original
agreement stated that the City was to share 1/3 of the income tax above the original 2%. As of 2018, Copley Township
has received approximately $1,731,850.

 Chapter 3:
Background

Community Improvement Corporation
In March 2017, the Copley Township Board of Trustees approved the creation of the
Copley Community Improvement Corporation and the group’s first organizational meeting
was held on November 9, 2017. The CIC is a non-profit corporation certified by the State
of Ohio and created under Chapter’s 1702 and 1724 of the Ohio Revised Code to foster
sound development that supports goals identified by Copley Township. The Copley CIC
has been designated by the Board of Trustees to act as the Township’s official economic
development agent for the purpose of advancing, encouraging, and promoting the
industrial, economic, commercial, and civic development of Copley Township. As such,
the CIC works in concert with the Township to implement its community and development
strategies known as Project Building Blocks.
The CIC board membership reflects the breadth and diversity of community and economic
development experience that characterizes Copley Township’s residents. The CIC includes
life-long and more recent Township residents.

DRAFT
9/4/2019

A sub-committee appointed by the CIC evaluated the Strengths, Opportunities, Aspirations,
and Results analysis that emerged from the CIC’s strategic planning process. Grouping
together some common items, the committee then organized the CIC’s priorities into three
themes: the need for a clearer township identity, possible actions and programs to address
deteriorating properties and strengthen the local economy, and physical improvements
that make Copley a place where people want to visit and live. The CIC board adopted the
following framework for its strategic plan:

IDENTITY: Project a clear and positive identity of Copley Township
Copley Township’s population and geography are diverse. People are often confused as to
whether they are in Copley or a surrounding community such as Fairlawn, Norton, Akron or
Bath. This confusion is heightened by the fact that the Township is home to four different
school districts – Copley/Fairlawn, Revere, Highland and Akron.

COMMUNITY IMPROVEMENT: Provide conditions which lead to economic resiliency
The diversity of Copley Township presents the opportunities of myriad housing choices,
large as well as quaint retail establishments, and a demographic and cultural population
mix that is unique among Ohio’s townships. However, challenges present themselves in
the forms of an aging housing stock and gaps in public infrastructure. Future community
improvements will need to strategically balance the interests of all stakeholders.

QUALITY OF LIFE: Strengthen the quality of life for those who live, work, and play within
Copley Township. A sound approach to development balances economic, cultural, and
environmental interests to achieve vibrant communities that meet the needs of a variety
of residents, businesses, and institutions. As housing, retail, and development trends
evolve, a community must be agile and anticipate future priorities. Providing choices
that enhance the quality of life attracts and retains residents and
businesses under any economic condition. Forward-thinking
communities make adjustments to advance the greater good.

The Copley Township Service Department is responsible for
maintaining administrative and maintenance related buildings,
Township Cemeteries, the Township Recycle Center, and the Copley
Community Park.

Most children in Copley Township attend the CopleyFairlawn School District. However, small portions
of the Township are in three other school districts;
Revere, Highland and the Akron Public School District.

The Service Administrative Building is located behind the Copley
Town Hall located at 1540 S. Cleveland-Massillon Road. The building
consists of approximately 8530 square feet and houses administrative
offices, storage and a maintenance area.

The following public schools are located in Copley
Township:

A 1500 square feet storage building, storage yard and salt facility are
located at 2777 Copley Road. The 4.51 acre parcel is also home to
the Copley Depot & ACY Caboose, which is a 656 square feet museum
managed by the Copley Historical Society.
The Service Department oversees three publicly managed cemeteries
in the Township. The Service Director acts as the Cemetery Sexton and
the service department personnel assist in burials, veteran burials,
genealogy searches and maintaining the Township cemeteries.

The Copley Township Cemetery was established in 1820 and over
the decades has grown into the present 9.5 acre site of today. It
consists of 9 sections, 56 blocks, 1842 burial lots which provide for
6507 individual graves. There is also a private section with 98 graves,
a Veterans Memorial Section with 369 graves, and a newly installed
columbarium with 300 niches for a total of 7274 individual graves.
It is the only active cemetery still performing burials in the township.
The Montrose Cemetery is a half-acre site and is located just south
of Medina Road (State Route 18). The Stimson Cemetery is a onequarter acre site located on South Hametown Road just north of
Stimson Road. Both are historical cemeteries and closed for burials.

Arrowhead Elementary School is located at 1600
Raleigh Blvd. and consists of 15.37 acres of land
including a playground and outdoor soccer and
baseball fields open to residents of the Township.
Copley-Fairlawn Middle School is located at 1531
S. Cleveland-Massillon Road and consists of 21.54
acres including a playground, outdoor baseball and
football/soccer fields, and a walking track open to the
residents of the Township.
Copley-Fairlawn High School is located at 3807
Ridgewood Road and consists of 56.33 acres including
an indoor swimming pool, outdoor football/soccer and
baseball fields, and a walking track open to residents
of the Township. The Copley-Fairlawn School District
Board of Education offices are co-located at the High
School.
Additionally, the Copley-Fairlawn City Schools Bus
Depot is located in Copley Township. The CopleyFairlawn City Schools Bus Depot is located at 3395
Trumbull Avenue and consists of 6.4 acres.

The Copley Township Recycle Center is co-located at 1280 Sunset
Drive with the Police Department. The Recycle Center consists of a
comingle container, an aluminum cans only container, and paper/
cardboard containers.
Copley Township does not have a Parks and Recreation Department;
therefore, Service Department employees maintain the park, and
schedule pavilion rentals and use of ball fields.
Service Department personnel also maintain Copley Square and assist
with the Heritage Day festival each year. Copley Square is 1.81 acres
of publicly owned land located east of Cleveland-Massillon Road and
rounded by Copley Road. A 328 square feet gazebo is situated at the
center of the Square.

Access Management
Access management is the practice of limiting curb cuts to major
roads to prevent conflicting turning movements and maintain safe
traffic flow. The Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) has
authority for restricting access to state highways. According to
ODOT, poor access management can reduce highway capacity to
20% of its design. Delay is as much as 74% greater on highways
without access management. Many accidents are driveway and
intersection related.

Proposed Transportation Improvement Plans

9/4/2019

Akron Metropolitan Transportation Survey (AMATS) 2030 Regional
Transportation Plan Recommendations include additional through
lanes, reconfigure access, operational improvements, and freeway
management system in Copley Township along State Route 18,
Interstate 77, and Cleveland-Massillon Road. These proposed
improvements are only part of the study at this time.

Transportation Projects

The following transportation projects have been completed in the Township since 2009.
State Route 18 between S. Hametown Road and I-77 - ODOT completed the improvement
project where two lanes were added - one westbound and one eastbound. An additional
lane was added to the State Route 18 eastbound to I-77 south entrance ramp. State
Route18 repaved from Medina Line Roads to I-77 southbound entrance ramp.
•  Cleveland Clinic/Edwin Shaw Rehab facility built on the north side of State Route 18 west
of Akron General Medical Center facility. Curb cut for entrance/exit drive on north side
of State Route 18 allowed but delineators were installed to prevent eastbound entry and
eastbound exit from the facility to prevent accidents from turning maneuvers across three
busy lanes of traffic.
•  Designated left turn lane from State Route18 westbound to S. Hametown Road was created.
•  Widening of I-77 to three lanes in both directions from State Route 21 to State Route 162
Copley Road has been completed.
• 

The following transportation projects are ongoing as of 2019 in the Township.

 Chapter 3:
Background

Farmland

Most of Copley Township is prime farmland according to the Summit County Soil Survey. Prime farmland
is based on potential farmland productivity which is primarily dependent on soil inherent quality and soil
management, and is often expressed in terms of land capability, suitability and expected yield. These
interpretations involve predictions about soil behavior or attributes that are based largely on a known or
obtainable set of soil properties that are maintained or predicted for each kind of soil.
The impact that elevated land values have on reducing the profitability of farming has become a critical
issue associated with farmland protection concerns throughout the state. The price of agricultural land
for development use is in stark contrast to land for agricultural use. In this case, land value for future
development is not determined by the land’s agricultural worth. Land value is, instead, often determined by
its location. Its value comes from where it is, rather than its physical productivity.
Given the farmland already lost, the need for genetic diversity and the need to become less dependent on
fossil fuels transporting our food to market, local farming will be critical to future generations. Farmland is
first and foremost a business; and the bottom line is profitability. Sustainable niche farming can create job
opportunities and keep dollars circulating in the community. The entrepreneurial success of these farms is
direct marketing food to consumers and developing cottage industries with unique products and services.

DRAFT
9/4/2019

Because Ohio’s agricultural sector is changing, many farmers have
searched for alternative farm based enterprises such as agtourism
and the associated different methods of producing and marketing
their products. Some farmers have been able to make this shift,
creating farmers markets. According to the Center for Agriculture
and the Environment, effective farmland policies tend to incorporate
the basic premise that farms are more than just land. Successful
programs leave the initiative with the farmer.

The Township supports working farms to the extent that if a
development was proposed to be built on a contiguous lot or close
to it, the farm use would not be required to change to accommodate a
proposed development including but not limited to dust, manure smell or
spreading, fertilizer, animal noises, corn horns.
According to the 2016 Community Perspective Survey, Copley
residents value open space and rural character and support
policies which manage growth in the Township. Copley has
2,763 acres (20%) of land classified as agriculture according
to the Summit County Fiscal records. Parcels were sorted for
Current Agricultural Use Value (CAUV). However, not all parcels
may actually be used for farming.
The Current Agricultural Use Value (CAUV) Program is a financial
tool for property tax purposes, farmland devoted exclusively to
commercial agriculture may be valued according to its current
use rather than at its “highest and best” potential use. By
permitting values to be set well below true
market values, the CAUV normally results
in a substantially lower tax bill for working
farmers.

Public Green Space/Trails & Greenways
Public Green Space
Copley Township currently has two public parks maintained by
the Township: Copley Community Park (“Park”) and the Copley
Square (“Square”). The Park consists of 93 acres and provides
the single largest public greenspace within the Township. The
Park offers visitors access to trails, rental pavilions, athletic fields,
playgrounds, pond, wetlands and other scenic environmental
features. Thousands of visitors take advantage of the Park
annually.
The Square is located in the center of the Township and was
created in 1831 by a land donation from Gardiner Greene and
his wife Elizabeth Greene of Boston Massachusetts. The Square
has been used for years as a public place for concerts, festivals,
farmers market, and a local gathering.

DRAFT
9/4/2019

The community’s public schools provide additional active
recreation fields that can also be used by the residents. These
facilities, while heavily used, are available to the school’s first and
local sport leagues second. Copley currently offers limited public
access areas for passive and informal use.
Copley Township is also within the Summit Metro Parks District.
Yet, there are currently no regional parks served by Summit Metro
Parks in the Township. That said, Summit Metro Parks is interested
in establishing a park presence in the Township. In particular, it
has looked at the Barberton Reservoir as a potential site.

Future Public Green Space

In 2004, EnviroScience completed a watershed study and natural
areas evaluation of Barberton Reservoir and Nature Preserve in
Summit County, Ohio for the City of Barberton and Summit Metro
Parks. The study evaluated the overall health of the Wolf Creek
watershed draining into the Barberton Reservoir and assessed the
integrity of the natural areas of the preserve. The study included
a comparison of past and current reservoir conditions as well as
a comparison of land use changes to estimate possible causes of
degradation and recommend protective measures.
The development of a park system is directly related to population
size and the resident’s recreation demands. In rural areas, open
space seems abundant, and the need for programmed recreation
areas to support smaller populations is usually not a community
priority. However, as land quickly develops, this trend changes as
does the population and scarcity of open space.

59

 Chapter 3:
Background

Public Green Space/Trails & Greenways
Future Public Green Space
The community needs to balance the opportunity to preserve high quality open space and recreation
amenities with the funds needed to support a park system. Analyzing community recreation needs through
a systems approach can provide an effective framework for a comprehensive public recreation and open
space system. One way to quantify the active and passive recreational infrastructure needed to satisfy a
community’s recreation demand is to determine a community’s “level of service”.
The level of service in an individual community reflects the acreage (area), or facilities needed to accommodate
the community’s current demand. More specifically, the level of service provides a general outline relating
active/passive recreational facility development (e.g., playground, baseball field) with population levels.
For example, the recommended level of service for a one-mile exercise path is to service 2,147 residents.
While population size and demand determine the location of a park, the level of service should influence
the individual park’s size, facilities and design. For example, a park design could include features such as
playgrounds, soccer and baseball fields, basketball courts and trails. The inclusion of these features into
the park design directly reflects the community’s level of service (the recommended amount of inhabitants
needed to legitimize the feature’s development) and recreation demand. Level of service is not only important
because it helps a locality plan an appropriate park location, size and
features, it also enables the locality to budget for park maintenance
and park improvements. In addition to level of service, connections
to existing parks, institutions, and neighborhoods also determine
park size and location. Most importantly, we need to analyze the
proximity, demand, and classifications of parks in relation to the
overall community.

DRAFT
9/4/2019

The table shows the park classifications based on park acreage
and the National Recreation and Parks Association (NRPA)
recommended park to population ratio. The table shows Copley’s
parks. While this is more of a litmus test than a hard rule, these
standards provide a guide to determine the community’s “level
of service” to other communities. One way to analyze parks is to
classify the different types. NRPA breaks parks into three park
classifications: mini parks, neighborhood parks, community parks.
Local and regional park systems as well as school facilities should
include a combination of the three park classifications.
A “mini park” is a park that is less than one acre. They are usually
developed to address limited, isolated or unique recreational needs.
This type of community park is the basic unit of any park system - it’s
purpose is to create a recreational and social focus for an individual
neighborhood, while also providing the community with active and
passive recreational opportunities.

“Neighborhood parks” range from 1 to 25 acres. They are usually
designed to serve a population of up to 5,000, but in many instances
even more people are served. These parks require 1 - 2.5 acres per
1,000 population served. Neighborhood parks
should be 5 - 24 acres in size, although many
times they are smaller. The neighborhood park
typically provides recreational facilities such as
60

 Chapter 3:
Background

Public Green Space/Trails & Greenways
Future Public Green Space
courts, craft facilities,playground apparatus, picnic tables/shelters,
and space for quiet/passive activities. The service radius for a
neighborhood park is one-half to one mile. Parks should be easily
accessible from a neighborhood through safe walking and biking
access. Parking may or may not be required. Where feasible the
activity areas are balanced between quiet/passive activities and
active play. This type of park may be developed as a school/park
or community center facility.
The “community park” is a park area that is larger than 25
acres. The community park functions on a different level than
the neighborhood park in that the community park’s goal is to not
only meet community-based recreation needs, but also preserve
open spaces and landscapes. Finally, a local system integrates
the three park types and their individual functions. The NRPA
recommendation reflects recreational acreage per 1,000   
community residents.

Summit County has identified, in its Trails & Greenway Master Plan, greenway corridors along Pigeon Creek
and Schocalog Run. In addition, trails have been identified around the Barberton Reservoir and along portions
of Wolf Creek. The purpose of the Summit County Trail and Greenway Plan is to preserve greenways, to
protect wildlife habitat and open space, and provide recreational, educational, and alternative transportation
opportunities. It creates an infrastructure of multi-use trails along utility corridors that are connected to
adjacent parks and nature preserves and makes available a system of adjoining and extensive trail mileage

In recent years, Copley has pursued the land acquisition of environmentally sensitive lands primarily within
the Little Farms neighborhood. The properties are being purchased in partnership with the Summit County
Land Bank with the end goal of utilizing the land for public greenspace and flood retention initiatives. Early
efforts have led to becoming grant recipients of the 2017 Little Farms Active Recreational and Transportation

the process of photosynthesis - and carbon
sequestering. Green infrastructure provisioning
services include: food, fresh water, fuel, fiber,
biochemical production and genetic stability.
Green infrastructure regulating services include:
climate regulation, disease regulation and water
purification. Increasing green infrastructure
increases recreation and ecotourism opportunities,
aesthetic value and many social benefits related to
health, education and individual well being. Green

Topography - Steep Slopes
While only two percent of Copley Township
has slopes over twelve percent (12%),
vegetated steep slopes are an important
natural resource to be preserved because
any significant disturbance to the hillside’s
environment may result in: landslides or
land instability, unacceptable alteration in
the drainage patterns, and loss of scenic
value. When development takes place on
or near steep slopes, vegetation cover is
greatly reduced. Loss of this vegetative
cover on steep terrain significantly
increases soil instability, and thus the risk
of erosion. Soil erosion and sedimentation
into waterways pose several threats to
public health and safety, which are difficult
and expensive to correct.
Property
damage is commonly associated with
development on steep slopes. Soil erosion
and sedimentation into nearby waters
increase the potential for flooding. Copley
Township works to manage development
in steep slope areas.

Watersheds
A “watershed” is defined as an area of land within
a drainage divide from which precipitation (rain &
snowmelt) drains via gravity to a body of water. All water
on land eventually drains into a stream, river, pond or
lake. This land area that drains into a particular stream or
river is called a watershed.
A watershed is a dynamic system that includes land,
soils, plants, wetlands, water bodies, land cover and
people. These factors all affect the water flowing
down through the watershed to the streams and rivers,
influencing flooding, erosion, water quality, water
temperature and habitat. A 2004 watershed study of
the Wolf Creek and natural areas evaluation of Barberton
Reservoir and Nature Preserve suggested that Copley
and other communities in the watershed should be
encouraged to further define general concerns and
issues regarding growth and change, developing a series
of alternative benchmarks, indicators, and options that
could guide future development. A realistic combination
of resource protection measures should be considered
for implementation. The Table and Map below show
watersheds delineated by Ohio Department of Natural
Resources (ODNR) and subwatersheds delineated in the

except during and shortly after rain/melt events. An intermittent stream is frequently flowing but
with seasonal dry periods. A perennial stream is permanently flowing. Streams support a vast array
of organisms and are important components of a number of inter-related ecological processes. It
is important to protect watercourses for the following reasons:
• Stormwater runoff and flood prevention are more easily accommodated by the presence of
healthy streams, thereby protecting private property from flood damage.
• Aquatic and terrestrial wildlife habitat can be supported through forested buffers, and by shading
water which moderates temperatures.
• Water quality is enhanced by filtering storm runoff and chemicals through forested buffers and
riparian areas.
• Passive recreational opportunities are supported by natural corridors such as streams.

The following table shows water quality designations for water bodies and watercourses in Copley.
A given water quality designation does not necessarily reflect existing conditions or imply that it
has been thoroughly sampled by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (Ohio EPA). Ohio EPA
defines the following use designations:
1.  Warmwater Habitats (WWH) are waters capable of supporting and maintaining a balanced,
integrated, adaptive community of warmwater aquatic organisms having a species
composition, diversity, and functional organization comparable to the 25th percentile for
identified reference sites within each of Ohio’s ecoregions.
2.  Exceptional Warmwater Habitats (EWH) are capable of supporting and maintaining a
balanced, integrated, adaptive community of warmwater aquatic organisms having species
composition, diversity, and functional organization comparable to the 75th percentile
for identified reference sites within each of the state’s ecoregions. All lakes, ponds, and
reservoirs except upground storage reservoirs1 are automatically designated EWH.
3.  Public Water Supplies (PWS) are waters that, with conventional treatment, are suitable
for human intake meet federal regulations for drinking water. All publicly owned lakes
and reservoirs, with the exception of Piedmont Reservoir, and all privately owned lakes
and reservoirs used as a source of public drinking water or emergency water supply, are
automatically designated PWS.
4.  Agriculture Water Supplies (AWS) are suitable for irrigation and livestock watering without
treatment.
5.  Industrial Water Supplies (IWS) are suitable for commercial and industrial uses, with or without
treatment. Criteria for the support of IWS designation varies with each type of industry.
6.  Primary Contact Recreation (PCR) during the recreation season is suitable for full-body
contact recreation such as, but not limited to, swimming, canoeing and scuba diving with
minimal threat to public health as a result of water quality. All lakes, ponds, and reservoirs,
except upground storage reservoirs and lakes and rivers meeting the definition of Bathing
Waters, are designated Primary Contact Recreation waters.

DRAFT
9/4/2019

1 Upground Storage Reservoirs are formed by artificial barriers on two or more sides and which impound water or
liquefied material pumped or otherwise imported from an exterior source. Lagoons are considered upground reservoirs.
They are automatically designated Warmwater Habitats.

 Chapter 4:

Environmental Conditions
Riparian corridors within Copley were delineated based on Summit County GIS Mapping Resources. The riparian corridor includes
all floodplains, steep slopes, and wetlands adjacent to streams or within the floodplains. The top of the valley slope was used as the
riparian boundary in areas with well-drained topography. All small tributaries mapped as streams were included within the riparian
corridor. In addition, other small, unmapped streams with obvious, well-defines valleys were included.

Floodplains and Riparian Corridors

DRAFT
9/4/2019

Floodplains
are the areas adjacent to rivers
and streams that are subject to periodic or regular
flooding. They are defined by designated recurrence
intervals at which a storm of a given magnitude could occur.
For example, the 100-year flood has a one percent (one-in-100)
chance of occurring in any given year. Due to periodic scouring of the
areas, floodplains are very unstable and potentially dangerous areas for
human use; however, they form a unique ecological niche, and support biotic
communities that are adapted for occasional inundation. Floodplain wetlands
absorb large volumes of water during high flows, reducing local flooding and
delaying the release of water downstream. According to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) floodplain, 6% of Copley lies within the flood hazard
zone. The Floodplain map gives a general location of the floodplains and represents
areas most likely to flood during the most severe storms. Factors influencing flooding
include ground permeability/imperviousness, slope, and the presence of flood-mitigating
factors. Flooding is increased where storm water runs directly off the land and into the
streams, as with impermeable soils, development, and unvegetated steep slopes. Flooding
is reduced by the presence of woods, wetlands, and permeable soils.

Healthy riparian corridor

Flood plains support a diverse assemblage of plant and animal life. In addition, they serve an
important role in water quality protection, since stream bank vegetation can filter pollutants
from runoff before they enter a waterway. In some instances, the established riparian zone,
or the land adjacent to the stream, extends beyond or does not have a mapped 100-year
floodplain boundary.
Riparian corridors include stream banks and associated areas adjacent to a flowing waterway.
Vegetated, riparian areas also function as stream buffer zones. There are many benefits of
stream bank setbacks, including protection from erosion. In addition, vegetated riparian
areas filter water pollutants (toxic chemicals, nutrients, and sediment) from runoff entering
streams. They also function to prevent stream warming, and provide food, cover, and habitat
structure for wildlife. The linear corridors provided by stream bank setbacks enhance wildlife
movement and migration for sensitive species. Protection of existing natural riparian
corridors is critical to the long-term health of streams and downstream receiving waters
and is also instrumental in adding aesthetic and economic well-being to the community.

Disturbed riparian corridor

In addition to environmental importance, riparian corridors also possess significant
economic value. Riparian corridors provide for recreational and health benefits, nonconsumptive secondary benefits, cultural enhancement, increased property values,
and an improved quality of life. In so contributing to
human welfare, both directly and indirectly, riparian
corridors represent part of the total economic
value of natural resources.

Chapter 4:

Environmental Conditions
Wetlands and Hydric Soils
The Army Corps of Engineers (Federal Register 1982)
and the U.S. EPA (Federal Register 1980) both define
wetlands as: “Those areas that are inundated or
saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency and
duration sufficient to support, and that under normal
circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation
typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions.
Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs
and similar areas.”

DRAFT
9/4/2019

Wetlands provide valuable environmental functions and
social benefits that include filtration and purification
of water, flood storage, ground water recharge,
supporting diverse communities of flora and fauna, and
recreational (hunting and fishing) and commercial use
(fur and fish harvesting). To date, the State of Ohio has
lost over 90% of its original wetlands due to draining,
dredging, filling or excavating.

The National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) is a series of
maps produced by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
based on analysis of aerial photographs. As such,
these maps are usually conservative, and actual
wetland boundaries are usually larger than what is
shown on the NWI. In addition, some types of wetlands
(wet meadows, lowland woods, and small vernal pools)
are not discernible on these photographs and so are
generally not shown on the NWI map. However, the
NWI map is a standard secondary literature reference
and starting point for wetland analysis.

Copley’s wetlands comprise of about 245 acres as identified on the NWI maps, or less than 2 percent of
the Township. Assuming the presence of other wetlands that are too small to be mapped by the inventory,
probably no more than four percent of Copley’s land area is wetlands.
The Copley Bog area with its rich muck soils appears to be former wetlands and floodplains. This area
has been identified by the South Summit Flood Task Force as an area where excess storm water might be
returned after diverting from county ditches.
Another secondary source useful in wetland analysis is the County Soil Survey. Published by the Natural
Resource Conservation Service, the Soil Survey contains maps, descriptions and technical characteristics
of soils throughout the county. Some soils are listed as hydric soils, and some soil types are listed as nonhydric soils with hydric inclusions. According to the Natural Resource Conservation Service, the definition of
a hydric soil is “a soil that formed under conditions of saturation, flooding or ponding long enough during the
growing season to develop anaerobic conditions in the upper part.” Mapped hydric soils are an indication
of the potential presence of wetland or their historical occurrence at a location.
Although analysis of secondary sources such as the NWI maps and Soil Survey maps is a useful first step
in wetland analysis, in almost all cases, legal wetland boundaries must be marked in the field by a trained
wetland delineator. These mapped wetlands represent only a portion of the total amount of wetlands within
Copley Township. This mapping should be considered an approximation of wetlands locations and sizes
within the Township. It is intended for planning purposes to give Copley an idea of where wetlands might
be; however, it should not be used as a substitute for a wetland delineation.
The presence of wetlands often coincides with the occurrence of hydric soils and non-hydric soils with
hydric inclusions. Wetlands are delineated based on hydric soils, the presence of wetlands hydrology, and
the dominance of hydrophytic vegetation. Hydric soils, as identified in the Soil Survey of Summit County,
were also used as part of the study.
Over a fourth of Copley Township (27%) has hydric soils and 5.5% of the township has non-hydric soils
with hydric inclusions. These soils are non-hydric, but can have small hydric soils in
depressions, along drainage ways and in other areas.

Chapter 4:

Environmental Conditions
Groundwater Resources
The terrain and geology of Copley Township is primarily a Sharon conglomerate laid down some
231 million years ago by glaciers that repeatedly moved into and receded from the area. Some of
the deposits appear to be as recent as 10,000 years ago.

Groundwater resources are important to understand because they supply public drinking water
and also because of their hydrologic connection to surface waters. The deposits left by glaciers
that once covered Copley Township affect groundwater yield. Glacial outwash can offer substantial
groundwater yields because of the large, interconnected pore spaces between the grains. Till, a
poorly sorted mixture of particles ranging from clay to boulders, offers very poor yields due to the
small pore spaces between the particles and soil compaction by the ice. The major groundwater
supplies occur in two general types of formations: Glacial outwash in existing and ancient, nowburied valleys, and sandstone bedrock underlying till.

DRAFT
9/4/2019

Groundwater represents an important source of potable water, which can become contaminated
from pollution sources at the ground surface and underground. Cleanup of groundwater
contamination can be extremely costly and difficult. Other potential sources of soil and groundwater
contamination
may
exist
, ranging from hazardous material sites and hazardous waste mishandled by businesses to leaking
underground storage tanks.

There is an interchange between surface water and groundwater. Groundwater is recharged from
infiltration. Given Copley Township’s dependence upon groundwater for much of its drinking
water, it is critical to protect groundwater resources and watercourses from which recharge is
received.

By recognizing and incorporating the interchange between surface water and groundwater, a
healthy environment will be provided to all citizens of the Township. Specifically, the quality and
composition of groundwater can be affected by both natural processes and human activity.

Environmental Conditions
Soils Suitable for Septic Systems

Since sanitary sewer service is not
available to a large portion of Copley
Township, it is useful to evaluate the
soil capability for septic systems.
Ideally, land with very poor suitability
for septic systems should be served
by centralized sanitary sewer or
alternative sewage disposal systems.

DRAFT
9/4/2019

Unfortunately, many of the soils suitable for septic systems are located on alluvial soils (formed by sediment deposited
by flowing water) near streams and drainage ways. These alluvial soils tend to be sandy and well-drained, which
is good for septic systems, but these areas pose other problems for septic tank absorption fields such as flooding
and groundwater contamination. In areas not served by sewer systems, it is recommended that only low-density
development will be allowed, in order to avoid potential public health problems should failing septic systems discharge
off-lot. Proper placement, maintenance, and operation of home sewage disposal systems are critical to ensure proper
functioning. Leaks from these systems can travel through the subsurface soils and contaminate groundwater supplies.
Regular inspection, maintenance, and pump-out is necessary to avoid failing septic systems, yet local governments
often refrain from aggressive enforcement of these activities in privately owned systems. In 2007, The Summit County
Health Department mapped appropriate development densities for acceptable septic system performance. With ever
changing technology, however, the importance of the suitability of soils issue may be overcome at some point in the
future. Therefore, it should be noted that there are other environmental carrying capacity issues other than septic
limitations that should be used to determine development densities. Aditionally, Summit County Public Health initiated
an Operation Permit program in May of 2015. Changes to the Ohio Administrative Code now require that no person shall
operate a Home Sewage Treatment System without a valid Operation Permit. The goal of this program is to improve
water quality in summit County and surrounding watersheds.
According to the Summit County Soil Survey, a majority (80%) of Copley is underlain by soils poorly suited for septic
systems. Only 14% of the land within Copley has soils that have only slight limitations for septic tank absorption fields.
Common limitations include a seasonal high water table, restricted permeability, poor
Percentage of Township Soil
natural drainage, the hazard of flooding, excess slope, and a shallow depth to bedrock.
Soils with a very slow or moderately slow permeability along with restrictive layers

Environmental Conditions
Woodland Resources (Canopy Cover)
Woodland resources are aesthetically pleasing and contribute significantly to the rural and scenic
character of Copley. Significant woodland resources were mapped using aerial photography. As
of 2004, analysis of the larger tracts of woodland reveals that Copley only has 22% canopy cover
and has experienced and additional decrease in canopy with new development.² The Township
implemented new Tree Preservation and Landscape Planning Standards in 2012 in an effort to
combat the decline of canopy in the Township due to development. It is the large tracts of woodlands
that provide the most public health and safety benefits, as well as aesthetic and ecological benefits.

The presence of trees and the high percentages of canopy cover positively impact the health and
vitality of our ecosystems. Woodlands are important environmental assets that provide a number
of public health and safety functions.

DRAFT
9/4/2019

Trees are a form of vegetative cover. Tree roots help to keep soil in place and reduce erosion. Tree
cover, especially in areas of steep slopes, helps to significantly reduce stormwater runoff rates.
Slowing runoff rates can reduce the incidence and severity of floods. Moreover, woodland resources
increase groundwater recharge and promote watershed protection. A well-canopied area’s ability
to function as a buffer to protect water quality is drastically improved, as the trees simultaneously
reduce runoff, soil erosion, and flooding and increase groundwater recharge.

In addition, woodlands can collectively provide measurable improvements in air quality by filtering
pollutants and lowering the incidence and severity of ozone production. Trees capture particulate
matter and produce oxygen. Canopy cover helps to reduce local and global air pollution by ingesting
carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxides.

2 Based on data provided by EnviroScience, Inc., ODNR lists Copley Township of having a 54% canopy cover in 1994.
It is estimated that the township had approximately 22% canopy cover in 2004. The company used its methodology
along with the County Department of Development data to get this figure and suggested a 32% decrease was largely
contributed to the development of Creekstone, the Heritage Woods area and Montrose Park.

This District, comprising the R-1 District in the
previous Zoning Resolution, is established to
provide for lower density residential development
that will: (1) protect natural resources and
maintain the environment and quality of life in the
Township; (2) discourage concentrated living areas
in the drainage area of the Barberton Reservoir
where such concentrations could create potential
pollution of the reservoir and (3) discourage
concentrated living areas in other areas where
the irregularity of the land and the higher cost of
providing central sewer facilities make higher
density development undesirable.

(Conservation
Development)
Residential
District

The primary objective of Conservation Development
Zoning is to promote the health and safety of the
community through the application of flexible land
development techniques in the arrangement and
construction of dwelling units and roads. Such flexibility
is intended to maximize the conservation of open space
while accepting development and retaining for the
property owner the development rights (the number of
residential dwelling units) that are permitted under the
existing conventional zoning for the property.

106

 These regulations may be applied in any Residential Zoning District, as specified below,
and are intended to achieve these corollary purposes:
To maximize protection of the community’s natural resources by:
1. Avoiding development on and destruction of sensitive natural resource areas;
2. Reducing the quantity and improving the quality of storm water runoff from expected
development;
3. Maintaining natural characteristics (such as woods, hedgerows, natural vegetation,
meadows, slopes and streams);
4. Reducing the amount of disturbed land, the conversion of natural areas to landscaped
areas for lawns, and discouraging the use of plants that are non-native invasive
species; and
5. Conserving areas of prime agriculture soils, to the extent possible.
6. To conserve (within the framework of natural resource conservation) the quality of
ruralness in a community which is characterized by:
a. Large, aggregated, undeveloped land areas;
b. Natural, features such as woodlands, steep slopes, floodplains, wetlands, stream
and river corridors, hedgerows and rock outcroppings;
c. Scenic vistas and rural views;
d. Significant historic features such as old barns and heritage trees;
e. Traditional rural settlement patterns characterized by clusters of compact
groupings of development in otherwise wide open spaces; and/or
f.  Appropriate topographic or vegetative screening.
7. To encourage more efficient use of land and public services through unified
development.
8. To establish development review criteria which promote creative design solutions in
a manner which best conserves the area’s resources.
9. To establish a review process which maintains local review and approval of the overall
development plan and which results in the timely consideration of an application.
10. To ensure that the proposed Conservation Development complies with the objectives
of Copley Township as expressed in this Township Zoning Resolution and the Township
Comprehensive Land Use Plan.

actions that will guide future development in
a manner that retains the open space design
of Bath Township. It protects the integrity
of existing neighborhoods and encourages
quality improvements in transitional gateway
areas of the Township. Bath Township Zoning
reflects the plan. In addition, Bath Township
Design Guidelines were developed by citizens
of the community and are the basis of

Alternative Development Scenarios
Under current zoning, buildout of potential
development areas would have significant
regional impacts on not only rural character
but also additional children in schools and
vehicular trips per day. Modeling was done
based on potential development areas as
determined by the land use survey and
removing environmentally constrained lands
that are protected under Summit County’s
riparian setbacks.
In the conservation

of
development
rights scenario buildout, development
was redirected from other environmentally
sensitive lands targeting unconstrained,
nonsensitive potential development areas and
infill for development and redevelopment.

DRAFT

CommunityViztm
Geographic Information
System (GIS) decision support software was
used to examine possible future land use
patterns and their effects and to illustrate
the results of alternative policy implications.
This included running a buildout scenario of
current zoning. A numeric build-out analysis
in CommunityViz made a mathematical
calculation measuring the holding capacity of
the potential development areas. Land use
assumptions were converted into building
counts. The assumptions included density,
efficiency, and constraints to development. An
efficiency of 80% was used for infrastructure.
Floodplains, wetlands, and Summit County
riparian setbacks were used as environmental
constraints to development.

The number of additional units that could be built exceeds 3,700, nearly
three quarters of existing households. Of these potential new homes in
the Township, many would impact current woodland resources and, even
with riparian setbacks, would be located in the riparian corridor. Buildout
under this scenario would affect the quantity and quality of water flowing
down through Wolf Creek watershed to the streams and rivers, influencing
flooding, erosion, water quality, and habitat. The results of the analysis are
contained in the following map and provide a planimetric view. For both,
current conditions and the projected buildout condition are illustrated.

Community Perspectives Survey

DRAFT
9/4/2019

In 2016,
The Township conducted a
Community Perspectives Survey with the
end-goal of a better understanding of needs and
wants of those within the community. The survey was
intended to capture the respondents geographical area of
residence, demographic information, and to prioritize areas of
interest. Upon the conclusion of the survey, a public forum was
held to reveal the survey. Survey results indicated that facilities
and public infrastructure were most important to respondents while
the preservation of arts and historical structures was valued the least.

A survey was made available online as well as paper/pencil and was
advertised via social media and other news outlets. A random sample of
the five (5) different zip codes within Copley were used to mail 200 paper
copies. A total of 486 surveys were submitted. Of those submitted, a total
of 96 paper surveys were returned while 390 were submitted electronically.

The Township solicited the consulting services of Larry Lallo, MBA CEcD.
Larry helped guide the Township in the discovery phase of community needs
and priorities. Larry utilized the professional expertise of Dr. Paul Levy, Ph.D.
Chair of the University of Akron Department of Psychology. Dr. Levy was
instrumental in helping design the Community Perspective Survey.
The results were compiled, evaluated, discussed and presented to the public
during a February 2, 2017 forum. The public forum was led by Township
Administrator Janice Marshall.
In total, approximately 80 individuals
attended the public forum. Results of the survey revealed that the
community values the following areas:
•  Facilitating public infrastructure
• Targeting restricted growth and land preservation policies
• Enhancing business growth and a desire to see small town
businesses flourish
•  To see neighborhood enhancements
within the housing stock

Chapter 7:

Public Engagement Plan

Overview

The Comprehensive Land Use Plan is a product by and for the community we live in. As such, Copley Township
strived to make participation in the update process as easy and welcoming as possible.
Public outreach was initiated through the design and implementation of a Public Engagement Plan (PEP).
The PEP included a Community Perspective Survey, Community Kiosks, Stakeholder Meetings, Open Office
Hours, Quick Poll Surveys, a Community Open House and Public Hearings.

Community Perspective Survey

The Public Engagement Plan (PEP) was initiated in 2016 with the development and deployment
of the Community Perspective Survey. Approximately 500 respondents completed the survey and
overwhelmingly the results told us that residents are happy with the way our residential land is
being used and wanted to protect that land and its value. Residents
expressed that they value growth in commercial and industrial
areas which focus on the infill, reuse and redevelopment
of existing land. Therefore, we focused our Future
Land Use on the Commercial and Industrial Areas
of the Township.

DRAFT
9/4/2019

Open Office Hours
The Department of Community & Economic
Development hosted an Open Office Hour
every Friday from 3:00pm - 4:00pm
beginning in March and concluding in
June.

During this time, staff spoke one-onone with 18 residents regarding the plan
and other topics affecting the Township.
Both residents and local business owners
attended the Open Office Hours.

Community Open House
The Zoning Commission, with the Department of
Community & Economic Development, hosted a Community
Open House for the Land Use Plan. The Open House was held  
 
on May 21, 2019 at the Copley Community Park. During the Open House,
residents were able to view a draft of the document in both hard copy and electronic form. Residents
were asked to provide feedback using the Comment Board provided on-site.
Staff hosted a picnic for those in attendance. Township Administrator, Janice Marshall and Trustee,
Helen Humphrys were in attendance to speak with residents and engage in a public open forum.
Staff reviewed the update with residents and answered questions regarding the
plan. Approximately 30 residents were in attendance including new residents
with young families and residents who have been in the community for over 60
years.

Stakeholder Meetings

Key Stakeholder Meetings were conducted with three different stakeholders in the commercial and
industrial areas throughout the year. Stakeholders were representative of the Montrose, Copley Square,
Medical/Office Corridor and Tech Corridor areas.
Stakeholder Meetings were conducted throughout November 2018 and included open discussion about
the current and future state of specific areas in the Township.

“The biggest challenge is anticipating what the future of retail will look like.”
Ms. Chinn-Levy stated that her concern is the concentration of big box stores
and the future of that retail model. She would like to see more local business in
this area and believes we can start planning now to make Montrose attractive
for new business and patrons through the installation of sidewalks and safe
crossing areas. She is interested in exploring form based or hybrid form based
codes most likely for the Square area.

Community Kiosks

Halloween in the Park Kiosk
The second Community Kiosk was held on
October 27, 2018 in conjunction with
Halloween in the Park. The goal of this kiosk
was to engage residents in a visual activity
which would allow them to consider what
they want the Township to look like in the
future.
Staff conducted a photo survey with the
purpose of identifying key design elements
from a variety of communities throughout
the country. Residents were presented with
17 photos and asked to select which photos
they would see as a best fit for Copley.
The majority of participants selected the same
four photos indicating a general preference
for design they would like to see in Copley
Township.

As part of the exercise, participants were asked

Community Kiosks

Heritage Day Kiosk
The first Community Kiosk was held on August 5,
2018 in conjunction with the Copley Township
Heritage Days. The goal of this kiosk was
to engage with residents and attendees in
an educational way and to introduce the
Comprehensive Land Use Plan.
Staff spoke with approximately 45 residents.
During this time, residents were asked to
participate in quick poll surveys and over 60
surveys were completed.
Additionally, attendees were presented with
the updated Goals & Initiatives for the
Comprehensive Land Use Plan. Residents
were happy to discuss the Future Land Use
Plan Map and engage with staff regarding
how land is used in Copley. Many residents
were not aware that Copley had a Land Use
Plan and expressed their gratitude for forward
thinking.

DRAFT
9/4/2019

Staff from the Department of Community & Economic Development hosted three
Community Kiosks to discuss the plan and learn what type of development residents
truly want for Copley Township.

Trolley Shop Hop
The final Community Kiosk was held on December
9, 2018 as part of the Trolley Shop Hop. Staff
conducted a mapping exercise of the Copley
Square area. Residents were asked to pin
photos on blank parcels.
The photos were taken from the Photo Exercise
completed with residents at the Halloween in
the Park Kiosk. The photos were representative
of the most popular photos selected by
residents during the kiosk.
Each photo had a color pin assigned and
residents chose the parcel in the Township
where they believed the photo would be most
representative of what the
area could look like in the
future. Approximately 30
residents participated.

DRAFT

The Ohio Revised Code provides four different ways a township may adopt and administer a
Planned Unit Development (PUD). A PUD may be adopted as a “conditional use” in any district,
an “overlay district,” a “floating district,” or established as a “unique” PUD district on a single
property with regulations that will only apply to the subject parcel. In terms of implementing a
PUD for conservation development, the Steering Committee identified the PUD overlay as the
preferred methodology in Copley.
A PUD Overlay is not a term used in the statute, but is commonly used by planners to describe
this method for a township or county to establish a PUD. A PUD overlay should not be confused
with a standard zoning overlay district because they do not work the same way. Once a township
establishes zoning regulations for a PUD Overlay in the Zoning Resolution and on the Zoning
Map, the new PUD Overlay just sits there, while the pre-existing zoning continues to operate as
though nothing happened. However, when a developer submits a PUD development plan and
an application to have a PUD apply to his property, once the development plan is approved by
the Zoning Commission, the Trustees, or both, the PUD automatically replaces the pre-existing
zoning (which is then removed from the parcel on the Zoning Map).
In terms of using a PUD for any possible mixed use or compact development that might be
considered in the future, the Steering Committee identified the floating PUD as the preferred
methodology. The floating gets its name not from the statute, but from a zoning district which
exists in the zoning text, but not on a zoning map. In this case, the PUD standards are amended
into the Zoning Code. A landowner is required to apply for a zoning amendment to rezone his land
to the PUD District on the Zoning Map. Quite often, townships require simultaneous rezoning and
development plan approvals. Development Plans submitted subsequent to the
rezoning can be reviewed by the township Zoning Commission as is authorized
in the Zoning Resolution.

a tool to help shift density from high priority open space to areas where growth is encouraged.
Current development methods tend to involve landowners in a process that is not effective in
controlling sprawl. TDR can be a key tool used in shifting density from one parcel to another.
Currently, Townships cannot approve the transfer of development rights. As a charter county,
Summit County could have the ability to adopt TDR and the Townships would not have to wait
for authorization from the State. Copley Township could be a pilot TDR program for the County.
In addition, many Township have approved non-contiguous subdivisions as a methodology of
transferring development densities.
TDR tools were designed to encourage conservation of high value, natural, agricultural, and
culturally significant open space while allowing for higher density residential and commercial
development in the targeted development corridors or concept areas. TDR tools encourage
developers to relocate development density, reduce densities in environmentally sensitive areas
or reduce density in other areas desired for low density.

DEVELOPMENT RIGHTS

DRAFT

An accepted approach is to identify two permitted densities in the development-redevelopment
zone. If the developer purchases development rights from a conservation zone or credits from a
bank, then a formula is used that increases density in the development zone. The profit from the
increased density must be greater than the cost of purchasing the development rights. These
cost comparisons are often the deciding factor in determining if a developer feels it is profitable
to use transfer of development right tools.
Implementation across Copley’s borders will require using intergovernmental cooperative
agreements that deal with joint planning and zoning. Copley would have to work with the County
and adjacent communities to identify significant areas within their boundaries where land
protection from development is a priority or commonly known as the Sending Zone and identify
the corridors where they would like to see redevelopment-development also known as the
Receiving Zone. Landowners in the Sending Zone can allocate a number of development credits
that can then be sold to developers, speculators or even the municipality. In return for selling
their development credits, the landowner in the Sending Zone agrees to place a permanent
conservation easement on their land. The purchaser of the development credits can apply them
to achieve higher densities on another site or apply them for a use that would otherwise not be
allowed on a property within the Receiving Zone.

Low Impact Design

Conventional Design

DRAFT
9/4/2019

Conservation Development is used to protect open space with higher densities where traditional
development might otherwise occur. Low Impact Development (LID) guidelines are best used when
development or redevelopment occurs within higher density or commercial/industrial areas. An effective
LID approach to land use regulation provides flexible performance-based goals and design criteria while
promoting opportunities for using innovative management practices and site planning techniques that
can be incorporated to compensate for development disturbance. Innovative techniques related to
planning and design for stormwater management grading, natural resource protection, and site layout
are commonly integrated in low impact development approaches.
An important technique to minimize runoff and better manage drainage is to use LID principles of design
in shaping land use in relation to natural resources at the site level. This includes using layout principles
that preserve and protect natural features, reduce this discharge from impervious surfaces into surface
waters, reduce sedimentation, and treat stormwater on-site by using natural features, such as woodland,
riparian buffers and even meadows to store stormwater.
Low Impact Design objectives include:
• 
Reduce runoff
• 
Recharge groundwater
• 
Reduce stormwater volume
• 
Protect streams
• 
Protect water quality
These objectives can be attained by:
• 
Conserving natural areas through land
planning and site design by minimizing
disturbance from clearing and grading,
preserving permeable soils, using alternative
paving surfaces, disconnecting roof drains
and minimizing the use of drainpipes.
• 
Strategic timing of stormwater release by
using open drainage systems, maximizing
flows over vegetated land before water
enters streams or other water bodies,
and determining best use of stormwater

• 

• 

detention times based on site location in the
watershed to minimize peak flows.
Integration of management practices related
to storage, detention, and infiltration related
to open drains, storage and bioretention
areas, use of smaller pipes and culverts to
encourage ponding and maximizing rooftop
storage volumes.
Prevention pollution in the watershed
through the use of erosion control and
stormwater best management practices,
use of pre and post development runoff
volumes, environmentally sound site
maintenance practices, chemical storage,
spillage regulations, and
pavement sweeping.

A Form-Based Code is a land development regulation that fosters
predictable built results and a high-quality public realm by using
physical form (rather than separation of uses) as the organizing
principle for the code. A Form-Based Code is a regulation, not a
mere guideline, adopted into a city, town, or county law. A FormBased Code offers a powerful alternative to conventional zoning
regulation.
Form-Based Codes address the relationship between building
facades and the public realm, the form and mass of buildings in
relation to one another, and the scale and types of streets and
blocks. The regulations and standards in Form-Based Codes are
presented in both words and clearly drawn diagrams and other
visuals. They are keyed to a regulating plan that designates
the appropriate form and scale (and therefore, character) of
development, rather than only distinctions in land-use types.
This approach contrasts with conventional zoning’s focus on the
micromanagement and segregation of land uses, and the control
of development intensity through abstract and uncoordinated
parameters, including Floor Area Ratio, dwellings per acre,
setbacks, parking ratios, traffic Level of Service, to the neglect
of an integrated built form. Not to be confused with design
guidelines or general statements of policy, Form-Based Codes
are regulatory, not advisory. They are drafted to implement a
community plan. They try to achieve a community vision based on
time-tested forms of urbanism. Ultimately,
a Form-Based Code is a tool; the quality of
development outcomes depends on the
quality and objectives of the community plan
that a code implements.

Copley Township embraces the concept of using Design Guidelines to provide consistent design principles
for residential and commercial structures. Residents felt that these guidelines would contribute to the
creation of a neighborhood with a positive, cohesive sense of place, and can improve the overall character
of the neighborhood by making it a more attractive, safe and inviting place to live, work and play. By
developing criteria that reflect local design priorities and concerns, Copley can influence aesthetic and
physical improvement requirements. Design Guidelines may guide redevelopment of areas, districts,
structures, and amenities. Design Guidelines can also advise and assist property owners regarding how to
maintain the character of a district or structure.
Design Guidelines are intended to facilitate the design review process by helping applicants and staff
to identify and devise solutions for design issues early in the application process. In summary, Design
Guidelines are intended to:
• 
• 
• 
• 
•

• 

Create a sense of place and enhance community identity;
Promote neighborhood pride;
Encourage high-quality development and creative design options;
Provide clear and usable design direction to project applicants, developers, designers, and Township

Facilitate a clear and expeditious project review process;
Evaluate projects for compliance with the design principles identified in this document. Although
it is understood that not all design principles will be applicable to all projects, conformance with
relevant principles is required.

Overall, Design Guidelines are intended to encourage consistent design while allowing

The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) refers to green infrastructure as a cost-effective,
resilient approach to managing wet weather impacts that provides many community benefits. While singlepurpose gray storm water infrastructure—conventional piped drainage and water treatment systems—is
designed to move urban storm water away from the built environment, green infrastructure reduces and
treats storm water at its source while delivering environmental, social, and economic benefits.
Copley Township can work with developers to encourage the use of green infrastructure during the
development process. Such uses may include:
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 

Downspout Disconnection

Storm water runoff is a major cause of water pollution in urban areas. When rain falls on our roofs, streets,
and parking lots in cities and their suburbs, the water cannot soak into the ground as it should. Storm
water drains through gutters, storm sewers, and other engineered collection systems and is discharged
into nearby water bodies. The storm water runoff carries trash, bacteria, heavy metals, and other pollutants
from the urban landscape. Higher flows resulting from heavy rains also can cause erosion and flooding in
urban streams, damaging habitat, property, and infrastructure.
When rain falls in natural, undeveloped areas, the water is absorbed and filtered by soil and plants. Storm
water runoff is cleaner and less of a problem. Green infrastructure uses vegetation, soils, and other elements
and practices to restore some of the natural processes required to manage water and create healthier
urban environments. At the city or county scale, green infrastructure is a patchwork of
natural areas that provides habitat, flood protection, cleaner air, and cleaner water. At
the neighborhood or site scale, storm water management systems that mimic nature
soak up and store water.
165

 Chapter 8:

Land Use Concept Area
Planning Concepts - Green Infrastructure
Downspout Disconnection
Water from the roof flows from this disconnected downspout
into the ground through a filter of pebbles. This simple practice
reroutes rooftop drainage pipes from draining rainwater into the
storm sewer to draining it into rain barrels, cisterns, or permeable
areas. You can use these areas to store storm water and/or allow
storm water to infiltrate into the soil. Downspout disconnection
could be especially beneficial to cities with combined sewer
systems.

DRAFT
9/4/2019
Rainwater Harvesting

This rainwater harvesting system is adapted to the architecture
of the building and its surroundings. Rainwater harvesting
systems collect and store rainfall for later use. When designed
appropriately, they slow and reduce runoff and provide a source of
water. This practice could be particularly valuable in arid regions,
where it could reduce demands on increasingly limited water
supplies.

Rain Gardens
A rain garden can be beautiful as well as functional. Rain
gardens are versatile features that can be installed in almost any
unpaved space. Also known as bio retention, or bio infiltration
cells, they are shallow, vegetated basins that collect and absorb
runoff from rooftops, sidewalks and streets. This practice mimics
natural hydrology by infiltrating, and evaporating or transpiring-or
“evapotranspiring”-stormwater runoff.

166

 Chapter 8:

Land Use Concept Area
Planning Concepts - Green Infrastructure
Planter Boxes
Planter boxes are an attractive tool for filtering stormwater as well
as reducing the runoff that goes into a sewer system. Planter
boxes are urban rain gardens with vertical walls and either open
or closed bottoms. They collect and absorb runoff from sidewalks,
parking lots, and streets and are ideal for space-limited sites in
dense urban areas and as a streetscaping element.

DRAFT
9/4/2019
Bioswales

Bioswales are essentially rain gardens placed in long narrow
spaces such as the space between the sidewalk and the curb.
Bioswales are vegetated, mulched, or xeriscaped channels that
provide treatment and retention as they move stormwater from
one place to another. Vegetated swales slow, infiltrate, and filter
stormwater flows. As linear features, they are particularly well
suited to being placed along streets and parking lots.

Permeable Pavements
Permeable pavement is a good example of a practice that catches
water where it falls. Permeable pavements infiltrate, treat, and/
or store rainwater where it falls. They can be made of pervious
concrete, porous asphalt, or permeable interlocking pavers. This
practice could be particularly cost effective where land values are
high and flooding or icing is a problem.

167

 Chapter 8:

Land Use Concept Area
Planning Concepts - Green Infrastructure
Green Streets and Alleys
Green streets combine more than one feature to capture and treat
stormwater. Green streets and alleys are created by integrating
green infrastructure elements into their design to store, infiltrate,
and evapotranspire stormwater. Permeable pavement, bioswales,
planter boxes, and trees are among the elements that can be
woven into street or alley design.

DRAFT
9/4/2019
Green Parking

Parking lots are a good place to install green infrastructure that
can capture stormwater that would usually flow into the sewer
system. Many green infrastructure elements can be seamlessly
integrated into parking lot designs. Permeable pavements can be
installed in sections of a lot and rain gardens and bioswales can be
included in medians and along the parking lot perimeter. Benefits
include mitigating the urban heat island and a more walkable built
environment.

Green Roofs
A green roof system atop a building helps manage stormwater
and reduce energy costs for cooling. Green roofs are covered with
growing media and vegetation that enable rainfall infiltration and
evapotranspiration of stored water. They are practicularly costeffective in dense urban areas where land values are high and on
large industrial or office buildings where stormwater management
costs are likely to be high.

168

 Chapter 8:

Land Use Concept Area
Planning Concepts - Green Infrastructure
Urban Tree Canopy
City trees, or tree canopy, soak up stormwater, provide cooling
shade and help to slow traffic. Trees reduce and slow stormwater
by intercepting precipitation in their leaves and branches. Many
cities have set tree canopy goals to restore some of the benefits of
trees that were lost when the areas were developed. Homeowners,
businesses, and community groups can participate in planting
and maintaining trees throughout the urban environment.

DRAFT
9/4/2019
Land Conservation

Land conservation is another good tool for communities to use
for reducing the risks of stormwater runoff and sewer overflows.
The water quality and flooding impacts of urban stormwater also
can be addressed by protecting open spaces and sensitive natural
areas within and adjacent to a city while providing recreational
opportunities for city residents. Natural areas that should be a
focus of this effort include riparian areas, wetlands, and steep
hillsides.

Proposed Boards & Commissions / Future Documents
In addition to reviewing planning tools, the Land Use Plan offers concept areas to guide future
development and redevelopment.
The Trustees could establish a structure of professional boards, commissions, or ad hoc committees
to oversee, advise, or handle certain tasks to accomplish goals and initiatives of the Township.
The Board of Trustees may also need to commission other planning documents to assist in the
development or creation of some of the ideas and concepts proposed.
Below are the proposed Boards & Commissions and the documents they may be responsible for
implementing and managing.

DRAFT

Proposed Boards & Commissions

Future Documents

Copley Township would create a position or hire a consultant
to conduct an economic redevelopment feasibility study,
identifying potential for economic revitalization for older
or under-performing retail/office/industrial properties
or corridors. Studies might determine the commercial
development potential of the area and identify market
conditions necessary for redevelopment to occur. The
position would also work with landowners, developers,
lenders and government authorities on future projects.

Copley Township would develop a plan that looks at the
corridor as a viable business/commercial corridor. The
plan would look at zoning, parcel sizes, transportation,
and infrastructure. This study might be combined with
the Copley Square Historical District Plan and the Copley
Road Corridor Plan.

Economic Redevelopment Position

Cleveland-Massillon and Ridgewood Corridor Plan

Copley Road Corridor Plan

Copley Township would develop a plan that looks at the
corridor as a viable business/commercial corridor. The
plan would look at zoning, parcel sizes, transportation,
and infrastructure.

Cost of Community Service Study
To justify open space preservation, a Cost of Community
Services (COCS) study would show that greenways and
farmland generate more in local revenues than they
require in services. A COCS study would be useful
to Copley Township to help to justify money spent on
preservation.

Farmland Preservation Committee

Farmland Preservation Plan

A committee would be created to develop, implement
and evaluate farmland preservation tools. The committee
would identify and assess the challenges farmers and
farmland owners are facing, their future plans/needs, the
level of public support for new and existing programs and
policies. It would identify techniques and issues that are
barriers to profitable farming, recommend methods to
ensure the long-term viability of agriculture, and evaluate
the cost to fund farmland protection and identify potential
local, state, and federal sources of funding for farmland
protection.

Copley Township would develop a Farmland Preservation
Plan to save farmland for future generations and to help
farmers create profitable new farm activities.

Society and Copley Square businesses to develop a plan
for the Copley Square area.

Copley Township would develop a plan that would look at
establishing a historic district that would protect, enhance,
and promote the district. The plan could establish design
standards as well as identifying possible mixed uses or
special zoning. Special state historic designations could
also be investigated. In addition, the plan would look at
funding opportunities for installing utilities underground
and the development of an artisan/farmers market.

Montrose Joint District Group

Montrose Study

The purpose of this group would be to provide
collaboration and continuity for this retail district. This
could include both regional marketing efforts through
design and signage standards. This group would be made
of the three communities that make up the Montrose
area - Copley, Bath, and Fairlawn. Each community could
appoint members to the group.

A Montrose study could look at design standards,
signage, landscaping, transportation and circulation, new
development and redevelopment opportunities within the
Township and adjacent communities in the Montrose area.

Neighborhood Ambassadors

Neighborhood Master Plan

Copley Township can establish a network of residents
who serve as representatives for each neighborhood as
identified in the Neighborhood Master Plan. Ambassadors
are charged with promoting improvements, identifying
problems, and informing neighbors about beneficial
services and programs.

A Neighborhood Master Plan can be utilized to engage,
educate and communicate with residents.

Parks and Recreation Committee

Parks and Recreation Plan

This committee would oversee planning and oversight of
both passive and active parks and recreation activities.
The committee could support the trustees and staff by
spearheading certain projects and events such as park
and open space acquisition, preparation of plans and
reports, and organizing various events.

Copley Township should develop a Parks and Recreation
Plan identifying areas to be acquired for passive and
active recreation and possible funding sources.

reviewing the plan developed by the Summit County Trails
and Greenway Plan to find opportunities for connecting
regional trail networks.

Copley Township would develop a Township wide greenway
implementation plan to protect corridors of open space
and to provide recreational opportunities. This study
might be combined with a Parks and Recreation Plan.

improvement or decline in one area contributes to an improvement or decline in connected areas. Areas include: A
vibrant, caring, just society; a healthy, nurturing environment; and a diverse, growing economy.
TIME-OF-TRAVEL DISTANCE: The distance that groundwater will travel in a specified time. This distance is generally a
function of the permeability and slope of the aquifer.
TOWN CENTER: A small, compact center with a core of mixed-use residential, commercial and community service
uses. These centers incorporate local-scale economic and social functions that are integrated with housing. The
center has a recognizable center and pedestrian scale and orientation.
TOWNSHIP: Throughout this regulation, this shall refer to the Township, an unincorporated subdivision in the State of
Ohio, its designated representatives, boards, or commissions.
TRANSFER OF DEVELOPMENT RIGHTS (TDR): The conveyance of development rights by deed, easement, or other
legal instrument authorized by local law to another parcel of land and the recording of that conveyance. It may cause
the creation of sender zones for development credits and receiver zones for these additional credits. This effectively
reduces the density in the sender zones and increases the density in the receiver zones.

TREE BOX FILTERS: Mini-bioretention systems installed beneath trees that can be very effective at controlling runoff,
especially when distributed throughout the site. Runoff is directed to the tree box, where it is cleaned by vegetation
and soil before entering a catch basin. The runoff collected in the tree-boxes helps irrigate the trees. Tree box filters
are ideal for situations where infiltration is undesirable or not possible, such as with clay soils, karst topography,
high groundwater conditions, close proximity to buildings, steep slopes, contaminated soils, brownfield sites, highly
contaminated runoff, maintenance facilities, and gas stations.
UNSTABLE SOILS: A portion of land determined by the Township to be prone to slipping, sloughing, or landslides, or
otherwise identified by the U.S. Department of Agriculture Natural Resource Conservation Service methodology as
having low soil strength.
UTILITIES: Facilities serving the public by means of a network of wires or pipes, and structures ancillary thereto.
Included are systems for the delivery of natural gas, electricity, telecommunications services, and water for the
disposal of sewage.
VARIANCE FOR A RIPARIAN SETBACK: A modification of the enforcement of the Riparian Setback regulations which
will not be contrary to the public interest and where, due to conditions peculiar to this property and not the result of
the action of the applicant, a literal enforcement of the regulation would result in undue hardship to the applicant.
VISIONING: A process of citizen involvement to determine values and ideals for the future of a community and to
transform those values and ideals into manageable and feasible community goals.
WALKABILITY: The extent to which the built environment is walking friendly which is based on land use mix; street
connectivity; residential density orientation and placement of homes; places to go to near the majority of homes; and
street designs that work for people.
WATERCOURSE: Any natural, perennial, or intermittent, channel, creek, stream, river, or brook having banks, a defined
bed, and a definite direction of flow, either continuously or intermittently flowing.
WATERSHED: The total area above a given point on a watercourse that contributes water to its flow.
WATERSHED DELINEATION: Mapping of a watershed requires identification of the topography and the accumulation
and direction of surface water runoff and exit through the lowest “pour point” of a drainage boundary.
WATER RESOURCE: Any public or private body of water including lakes and ponds, as well as any brook, creek, river,
or stream having banks, a defined bed, and a definite direction of flow, either continuously or intermittently flowing.
WELL: Any excavation made by digging, boring, drilling, driving, or other method for the purpose of removing ground
water from an aquifer, except a monitoring well used to extract samples of ground water or for the purpose of
determining the quality, quantity, or level of ground water.

 Chapter 10:
Definitions

WETLANDS: Those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency and duration
sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted
for life in saturated soil conditions, including swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas. (40 CFR 232, as amended).
Wetlands shall be delineated by a site survey approved by the Township using delineation protocols accepted by
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Ohio EPA at the time of application of this regulation. If a conflict exists
between the delineation protocols of these two agencies, the delineation protocol that results in the most inclusive
area of wetlands shall apply. In reviewing this wetland delineation, the Township may consult with a representative of
the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, Division of Surface Water; the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers; the Summit
County Soil and Water Conservation District; or other technical experts as necessary. Any costs associated with such
consultations may be assessed to the applicant or their designated representative.
WETLAND SETBACK: Those wetland areas within the Township that fall within the setback area set forth by all applicable
requirements.
ZONING: A map and ordinance text which divides a political subdivision into land use “zone” and specifies the types
of uses, setbacks, lot size, and size restrictions for buildings within that zone.
