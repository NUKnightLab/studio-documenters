Discussion of 2013 Activities and 2014 Initiatives

The BOR completed its prior session on April 19. 2013. positioning the Cook
County Property Tax System to issue second installment bills payable on August
1st. repeating its success for the second time in 34 years. This accomplishment
benefited local taxing jurisdictions. which avoided spending interest bearing
reserves or issuing tax anticipation warrants. The cost to taxing jurisdictions of late
bills is estimated to be at minimum per month.

The BOR must complete its current session by April 18. 2014 for bills to be due on
the statutory deadline. This poses a challenge because the BOR anticipates the
North reassessment triennial to yield in excess of 350,000 parcels for review.

The BOR will open the first group of townships for its current session on August 5.
2013. These adjustments and other changes to BOR procedures implemented last
year should increase the likelihood of finishing the BOR on time.

The BOR and County Bureau of Technology made enhancements to its online
filing system. During this shared services effort. Bureau of Technology made
enhancements and upgrades to the BOR's digital infrastructure in order to promote
increased use of the online filing system. improve accountability. and increase
workflow efficiencies. including:

- Online preregistration of appeals enhancements.

Online access to bulk filing for mult'ple properties enhancements.

- Digital Docketing intranet System enhancements.

Other collaborative projects in FY2013 include:

Worked with Bureau of Technology and the Office of the Chief Procurement
Officer to issue an RFP in August of 2013 for implementation of a paperless
workflow process in subsequent Board sessions pursuant to prior authorization by
the IT Collaborative Board.

- Worked with Bureau of Technology implementing a bar code tracking system to
improve handling of current paper complaint system.

The BOR Commissioners published an Annual Report outlining activities for the
2012 session.
