STAFF REPORT: 11-13-2019 MEETING
ADDRESS: 495 BRAINARD
HISTORIC DISTRICT: ADJACENT TO WILLIS SELDEN
APPLICANT: BLAKE HATTERMAN

PREPARED BY: J. ROSS

495 BRAINARD DEMOLITION/NEW CONSTRUCTION
• The building located at 495 Brainard is a one-story, commercial building that was erected
ca. 1938. The parcel includes the building, the paved concrete parking area, and the brick
driveway which is located to the immediate east of the building. A review of historic-age
Sanborn Fire Insurance maps indicates that the brick driveway which is located to the
immediate east of the building at 495 Brainard was originally an alley.
• Sanborn Fire Insurance maps indicate that the building originally housed a filling station
and printing business
• As per the attached map, the project/subject parcel is located district adjacent/outside of the
Willis Selden local historic district’s southwestern boundary
• The current project includes the following:
o Demolish the building at 495 Brainard
o Erect a new three-story, mixed use (residential and commercial) building as per the
attached. The new building will be clad with brick and cast stone. Colors are
generally neutral
o Establish a new concrete parking area
o Install landscaped buffer between 495 Brainard and the adjacent 481 Brainard
(which sits within the boundaries of the Willis Selden historic district
WILLIS SELDEN HISTORIC DISTRICT
• The district was designated in 2010
• As per the Detroit Historic designation Advisory Board, the district “…represents one of the
largest concentrations of architecturally significant, late nineteenth and early twentieth century
buildings of mixed uses extant in Detroit. The district’s residential and commercial building
stock reflects the history of the area, from its development as a streetcar community in the late
nineteenth century through the intensification of its land use in the early twentieth century and a
decline in new construction during and after the Great Depression.
• 481 Brainard is the property within the district which is directly adjacent to the subject property
that is proposed for demolition and new construction
• 481 Brainard includes a house which was erected ca. 1890 and an attached commercial
building, which was erected ca. 1935.
STAFF OBSERVATIONS
• The Willis Selden historic district is diverse and includes a mix of residential, commercial, and
industrial buildings
• Within the district, building range from 1-4 stories in height.
• A number of two-four story buildings are located within the district/within the immediate vicinity
of 481 Brainard
• It is staff’s opinion that the historic-age building proposed for demolition at 495 Brainard has been
altered to the extent that it has lost it’s historic integrity and would therefore not contribute to the
district should a future boundary extension be considered.
