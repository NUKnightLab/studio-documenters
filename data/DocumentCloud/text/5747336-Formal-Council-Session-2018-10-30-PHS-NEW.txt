Good Afternoon/Evening Gentlemen,

Please see responses below from Executive Leadership (GM, Director of Sales 8L
Marketing and Director of Engineering) from questions that arose during our pre-
planning visit last Saturday, 9/15. In addition, our General Manager said that CityLab
may run into an obstacle with trying to accomplish some of these items with vendors
on a weekend.

1) is CityLab able to change out the flagpole banners in front of the hotel?
Currently they are the Run Westin theme. They are willing to use our vendors
and be responsible for any expense with changing out and putting theirs up.
They want to put up the Bloomberg, Aspen Institute and Atlantic logos. What
is needed to make this happen IF they can do it? Yes, this is doable, but we ask
that CityLab work directly with the vendor versus us being the go between
since this isn?t on hotel property. CityLab would need to pay the full cost for
our banners to come down, CityLab?s to go up/down and ours to go back up.

2) Do you have a preferred suppiier who created the Run Westin banners? The
Vendor is ?banner sign company" and all we have is an email address for
Christopher Kovie: there also may be city permits
required to do this.

The two ?display windows? by 24 Grille on the Michigan Ave. entrance do
we CityLab would like to put something in there and brand for

A Vhrr?nhnn1 1 ni?n '1 mm 0

Page 3 of 4

their event as Bloomberg/mayoral attendees will be going/coming from
Michigan Ave. Entrance on Sunday. is this possible? We are unable to
accommodate this request as Travel Traders Gift Shop windows are part of
their lease.


4) CityLab: is asking to take down the Westin Flag and replace it with the CityLab.
Flag - is this possible? This is possible and would need to be done on a
weekday. The flag would have to be here well in advance and be similar size
tot the remainder of our flags. It would then need to be removed on a
weekday following the event and we can ship back CityLab's flag. The
shipment cost would be CityLab?s. This would need to be scheduled by our
Engineering Department. General Manager has the Westin Flag coming
down for CityLab. The charge is approximately $450.00 to do this.



5) CityLab) is hoping to do a 3~dimensional iog'o atop the Port Cochere (where
Engineering places the Christmas trees each year) is it possible forthem to do
this? If !so, what Is the weight limit and Is there anything to "strap? down the
objecttl i. hooks)? Unfortunately we do not know the weight limit and don? 
have anything stating that number. We would need to see the item, along with
knowing the weight first. There are no "hooks? atop the roof. We actually use
cement blocks to hold down the plywood that the trees are mounted to.
Again, once we see the item CityLab wants to put up there, we will have a
better idea of what can be done size, material, weight, etc.)

6) Lighting on the hotel outside is it possible for CityLab or us to manage the
colors (instead of white/gold)? If so, is this done manually by light Or by
remote? Group is wiiling to pay our vendors to do so All up lights outside are
white color. They are controlled by a timer to turn them on and off. if CityLab
wants to change the color they would need to purchase colored bulbs of the
same spec as what Is used in the ?xtures presently i don know if a colored gel
can be placed over the lights to change the color. The lights get extremely hot
when they are on. Do you know what colors are needed?

How often are the sidewalks power washed? I know Shelby was done a month
or so ago, but CityLab' Is concerned with the Washington Michigan Ave.

entranchs. Will it be done between now and October if not, can they pay
to have it done? Group is also looking to have a CityLab branded carpet out on
Washington, but NOT Michigan (hence the power washing request). The hotel
will payifor an additional power washing prior to group arrival of Michigan Ave.
Washington entrances.

RE:

DDOT Fare Increase Ordinance

 

Council is currently considering an ordinance to update the DDOT bus fare schedule as part of the
overall restructuring of the DDOT system. I request that the fare increases occur no sooner than 12
months after the effective date of the ordinance. I also request the following prior to the rollout of

the bus fare increases:

1.

U.)

6.

7.

Budget amendment allocating an additional $1,000,000 to DDOT to fund the following
critical upgrades:

a. 50 Bus Shelters;

b. Additional fare card kiosks;

c. Additional destination signs at shelters and on buses.
Budget amendment (recurring) allocating an additional $800,000 to DDOT to implement the
Bus Ambassador program as outlined in the Strategic Transportation Plan, which will train
riders on how to use the new system, as well as roll out the Bus Shelter team.
Provide the recently completed equity report.
As requested by Member Ayers, please include within the proposed ordinance a reduced
fare category for low-income riders, using the Portland, Oregon1 and Madison, Wisconsin2
low-income fare structures as models.
Cleanliness of buses and lack of customer service remain the top complaints from residents;
please describe the strategy, timeline, and resources allocated to address those concerns.
What resources, including staff and funding, are being allocated to ensure accessibility for
non-English speakers and visually or hearing-impaired riders?
What strategies, if any, will be implemented to accommodate homeless riders?

Please do not hesitate to contact my of?ce if you have any questions. Thank you.

0 The additional revenue from the fare increase will be encumbered for what
