 Dear Chamber Leaders and Members of the General Assembly:
We are pleased to deliver to you the attached Final Report of the Illinois General Assembly
Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Task Force.
This Report is the first official government report in Illinois to be permanently certified in a
public blockchain, a small gesture that we believe will demonstrate our desire to see
government begin to use this technology. Though the mathematics behind the unique digital
fingerprint assigned to this Report may be difficult to understand, it is clear that distributed
ledgers can begin a transition to a smarter, cheaper and safer way to administer government.
On June 28th 2017, this Task Force was charged by HJR 25 with studying: 1) opportunities and
risks associated with using blockchain and other distributed ledger technologies, 2) the
different types of blockchains, public and private, 3) projects and use cases in other
states/nations that Illinois could consider, 4) how current state laws could be modified to
support this technology, 5) encryption technology, including Illinois’ digital signature
infrastructure, and 6) official reports and recommendations from the Illinois Blockchain
Initiative. The attached Report will provide more detail in each of these areas, and we urge you
to read it and contact any member of the Task Force if you would like to learn more.
To broadly summarize our findings, this Task Force believes that blockchain technology and its
built-in encryption can facilitate highly-secure methods for interacting with government and
keeping paperless records, increasing data accuracy and providing better cybersecurity
protections for Illinois residents. Though the technology still needs refinement, government has
an opportunity to help shape and adopt innovative solutions.
As you may know, the State of Illinois has a strong reputation as a leader in supporting
blockchain and distributed ledger technologies, and maintaining a “light touch” and progressive
regulatory approach. Our ongoing studies and pilot programs through the Illinois Blockchain
Initiative are talked about across the globe. We believe our unique intergovernmental
partnerships demonstrate how all layers of government can work together to jointly develop
this “digital infrastructure” and build resilient networks that protect each other’s data and
share the cost of hardware and software.
Make no mistake, blockchain technology must improve its scalability and smart contract
security before government adoption becomes widespread. But, we must remember that every
day more and more Illinoisans are losing time and money due to hacks of their personal data,
and government owes it to its taxpayers to lead a shift away from centralized servers full of
sensitive data to a decentralized network that is more secure and easier to administer.
Sincerely,
Members of the Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Task Force

 The Next Generation of the Internet
The first digital revolution brought endless innovations as the internet, social media, mobile and
big data have changed nearly every aspect of our lives. Though the internet may have
revolutionized communication, it has not necessarily transformed business and commerce in
terms of trust.
Establishing identity and transacting value online still requires verification from a trusted third
party (banks, governments, big technology companies).
While intermediaries fill a vital role in transacting value, relying too heavily on them often
comes at the expense of inclusive prosperity. Intermediaries add costs and frictions to our
economy for both businesses and consumers. They monetize vast amounts of data privacy and
leave over a quarter of the world’s population out of the global economy.7

The Internet of Value
Enter the blockchain, the first “native” digital medium for peer to peer value exchange.
Anything of value, money, titles, deeds and identity attributes can be exchanged, stored, and
managed securely and privately. Trust is not established exclusively by powerful intermediaries,
but through network consensus, cryptography and code. 15

The Promise of Blockchains
Blockchains as peer-to-peer digital economies have the capability to address fundamental
societal issues:
● They create a secure platform that enables immutable, irrevocable digital identities.
● They have the ability to provide universal access to financial services and government
benefits
● They spur a stronger economy and create social stability through greater economic
participation
Blockchains are rapidly becoming the foundation of the Fourth Industrial Revolution: 13
● They are being used to create distributed market structures to address security risks and
eliminate single points of infrastructure failure.
● Supplying regulators with real time data on financial flow and asset class risks, they
stand poised to improve the oversight of international markets.
● They are integrating granular provenance tracking, identity management and concepts
of digital scarcity horizontally and vertically through global supply chains. 11

6

 ● In a 2015 World Economic Forum survey of global business and government leaders 58%
of respondents believe that 10% of global gross domestic product (GDP) will be stored
on blockchain technology. 19

The Unanswered Questions
Although blockchain technology may prove to be one of the most disruptive innovations of the
21st century, it currently is discussed as if it were more mature than it actually is. Many
implementation hurdles at the technical, regulatory and governance level continue to hinder
widespread adoption for both open and private blockchain networks. Blockchains are
inherently a “network” technology meaning that without wide-scale collaboration and
coordination, their power to improve society will never be realized. 1

Few Impactful Implementations
Since 2015, banks, regulators, tech giants and startups all over the world have raised billions
of dollars to explore the promise of the blockchain. Despite the exuberance for the
technology to date, Bitcoin still stands to be the only successful, scalable implementation of
blockchain and distributed ledger technology.

The Limits of Open Governance
Contrary to popular belief, open and decentralized governance does not automatically
mean fair and equitable rule of law. Democracy cannot be reduced to majority rule and
consensus is a complex construct that requires concepts such as minority rights, equal
access to decision making and legitimacy of procedure. Bitcoin’s recent scaling debate and
Ethereum’s Decentralized Autonomous Organization or DAO scandal have brought to light
the notion that “code is not law” and that a 51% majority does not always equal democracy.
2

Decentralized Market Structures are Untested
Blockchains and decentralized market structures are relatively untested in our global
economy, which could either (a) be less preferable than ”trust taxes” or (b) introduce
fundamentally new risks into the global economy. By displacing intermediaries who
policymakers have historically relied on to implement regulatory safeguards, it is unclear
who or how broader systemic policy changes can get implemented when necessary. 11

Charting a Path Forward
Although government appear to be the antithesis of a technology that decentralizes economies
and places trust in code over law, it is incumbent on the public sector to help catalyze the
growth of this technology. Furthermore, the greatest risk may be letting of blockchain
technology’s potential fade, stagnate in its fractured status quo or be implemented in a noninclusive way. Ultimately, code, algorithms, policy and rule of law are all artefacts of human
design. Technology alone does not create prosperity, people do.

7

 In Illinois, we believe it is imperative for government to take affirmative steps to harness the
tremendous opportunities and minimize the risks of blockchain technologies during this critical
period of development. In doing so, the state of Illinois will be able to:

1. Catalyze an Ecosystem for Growth and Collaboration
Although, the long-term benefits of blockchain are clear, blockchains and DLTs are still
very much nascent technology. Governments can play a role in catalyzing its maturity as
a technology by supporting grassroots developer innovation and encouraging
collaboration among enterprises, countries and entrepreneurs.

2. Rethink Governance for a Distributed Economy
Effective governance in a distributed economy will require legislative agility beyond
what rules and regulations can provide. Modern governance will need to carefully
balance a combination of broad policy principles, technology standards and “code”.

3. Create Hyperconnected Services for a Highly Efficient Government
A “hyperconnected” government enables unprecedented integration and efficiency,
where services are tailored to each individual’s needs. Blockchains will be used to
connect disparate entities within and across regional, municipal, and state entities
around citizens, businesses and assets. 9

What is Blockchain?
In simple terms, a blockchain is a type of database that is replicated over a peer-to peer (P2P)
network. However, this definition could also apply to other types of distributed databases that
have no central database manager. So, what makes a blockchain special?
The principal way in which a blockchain is different from other distributed databases is that a
blockchain is designed to achieve consistent and reliable agreement over a record of events
(often referred to as the “state”) between independent participants who may have different
motivations and objectives. Put in a slightly different way, participants in a blockchain network
reach consensus about changes to the state of the shared database (i.e., transactions amongst
participants) without needing to trust the integrity of any of the network participants or
administrators.
The agreement between blockchain network participants over the state of the database is
achieved through a consensus mechanism, which ensures that each participant’s view of the
shared database matches the view of all other participants. The combination of the consensus
mechanism with a specific data structure allows blockchains to solve the so-called ‘double
spending’ problem. 10

8

 All participants have a consistent view of the shared database state. As a result, any improper
alteration of the data (e.g., tampering by a malicious actor) will be immediately detected and
rejected by all participants.

Components of Blockchains and Distributed Ledgers
Blockchains and distributed ledgers generally have the following five components:
Use of a variety of cryptographic techniques including
cryptographic one-way hash functions, Merkle trees
and public key infrastructure
Network for machine-readable data discovery and
replicated peer-to-peer data sharing
Algorithm that determines the ordering of transactions
in an adversarial environment (assuming not every
participant is honest)
List of cryptographically linked transactions (e.g.
bundled in “blocks” for blockchains, direct acyclic
graph DAG in IOTA)
Common set of rules of the network (i.e., what
transactions are considered valid, how the ledger gets
updated, etc.) 9

 Permissionless
A permissionless blockchain or distributed ledger generally refers to a ledger where anyone
may operate a validator node, i.e., a node that participates in the consensus protocol to
validate transactions.
Permissioned
A permissioned blockchain or distributed ledger refers to a ledger where permission from
some governing entity is required to operate a validator node.
Public
A public blockchain or distributed ledger refers to a ledger that is “open to the public” for
usage, i.e., anyone can create transactions on the ledger
Private
A private blockchain or distributed ledger refers to a ledger where permissions to write
entries are restricted to a single organization and read permissions can be either public or
restricted. 5

Consensus Mechanisms
A consensus mechanism is the process in which a majority (or in some cases all) of network
validators come to agreement on the state of a ledger. It is a set of rules and procedures that
allows maintaining coherent set of facts between multiple participating nodes.

Proof of Work
A proof-of-work (PoW) protocol generally involves proving that some resource has been
expended (typically processing time by a computer). It is a method to deter an abuse of
service (i.e. denial of service attacks, spam, double spending) by requiring some form of
"work". In a public blockchain, such as Bitcoin, PoW removes the need for trust amongst
anonymous actors by reducing the likelihood of an attack by a single malicious actor. In
this case, PoW aims to prevent one party from holding a majority of computational
resources at one given time. Examples include:
Bitcoin
IOTA

Ethereum
Z-Cash

Dash
Monero

Proof of Stake
Proof of stake is a newer consensus mechanism designed to be less resource intensive.
The key motivation for proof of stake is that consensus is performed by stakeholders
who have the strongest incentive to be good and honest stewards of the system. Put
differently, the nodes that validate transactions have ‘skin in the game.’ The major
benefit of this consensus mechanism, as compared to proof of work, is that there is a

10

 large reduction in energy consumption resulting from a decreased need for hashing
power.
Tezos
Qtum

Ethereum (Casper Release)
Nxt

NEO
Cardano

Majority Voting (Variants of Practical/Federated Byzantine Fault Tolerance)
In majority voting systems, consensus is determined by a 2/3rds majority vote, designed
to achieve byzantine fault tolerance for smaller networks where actors or participants
are known and generally trusted. 22 Examples include:
Hyperledger Fabric
Ripple
Zilliqa

Tendermint
Quorum
Sovrin

Hashgraph
Stellar
Corda

Additional Blockchain Concepts
Smart Contracts
A smart contract is a collection of code and data (sometimes referred to as functions and state) that is
deployed to a blockchain (e.g., Ethereum). Future transactions sent to the blockchain can then send data to
public methods offered by the smart contract. The contract executes the appropriate method with the user
provided data to perform a service. The code, being on the blockchain, is immutable and therefore can be
used (among other purposes) as a trusted third party for transactions that are more complex than simply
sending funds between accounts. A smart contract can perform calculations, store information, and
automatically send funds to other accounts.

Forking
Changes to the blockchain software and implementation are called forks. A soft fork is a change to the
technology that will not completely prevent users who do not adopt the change (e.g., an update to the latest
version) from using the changed blockchain system. Since non-updated nodes will recognize the new blocks
as valid, a soft fork can be backwards compatible, only requiring that a majority of nodes upgrade to enforce
the new soft fork rules.
A hard fork is a change to the technology that will completely prevent users who do not adopt it from using
the changed blockchain system. Under a hard fork, the blockchain protocol will change in a manner that
requires users to either upgrade to stay with the developer’s “main fork” or to continue on the original path
without the upgrades. Users on different hard forks cannot interact with one another. Any change to the
block structure, such as the hashing algorithm choice, will require a hard fork.
With cryptocurrencies, if there is a hard fork and the blockchain splits, the coins each person has at the time
of the split will be mirrored on each fork. If all the activity moves to the new chain, the old one will eventually
not be used. 22

 Benefits and Opportunities
Transaction = Reconciliation
Reconciliation is the process of ensuring that two sets of records agree. Particularly in the
financial industry, the reconciliation of transaction records is critical to the accounting process.
Bank A engages in a transaction with Bank B, and each bank records an entry in its respective
ledger. At some point in the future, the entries are reconciled to ensure accuracy. The need for
reconciliation extends beyond finance, and can include any data set or record that is
maintained by more than one party.
Blockchain technology addresses data reconciliation by requiring network participants to share
data points. In the banking example above, instead of Bank A and Bank B maintaining separate
entries for a single transaction, they would share a single entry maintained on a shared ledger,
eliminating the need to reconcile entries later.
Another subtle, but powerful impact of blockchain technology is the standardization of data
and transactions formats. When users join a blockchain network, they (and their computers)
agree to a protocol – a format for transmitting data between nodes on a network. By virtue of
their participation, users are bound by the data and transaction formats of the network. Not
only are the parties communicating in the same “language”, they are sharing a place of record.
18

Immutability and Data Integrity
The permanent and persistent storage of transactions on blockchains, it’s “immutability”, is
particularly useful for trusted governance, evidentiary or audit purposes. For example, forensic
analysis and legal discovery processes could be conducted without the need for special
methods, expensive technologies, or significant resources being employed. The clear benefit
here is reduced court costs where a jurisdiction recognizes the facts in the distributed ledger as
admissible. These reduced costs would could also create positive externalities such as improved
behaviors, like honesty, encouraged by the transparency and immutability of the ledger.
Blockchains present opportunities for regulators to access high integrity records of transactions
in real or near-real time. A persistent and machine-readable history of transactions would allow
regulators a macro-view of an institution’s compliance with assurance that no transactions had
been tampered with. This unprecedented view into regulated industries would open pathways
to productivity gains and risk management if managed appropriately.
Distributed ledger systems are transparent in that all transactions are traceable, and
permanently stored by the network of participants. While a private distributed ledger network
may add restrictions to who can write or read transactions, it preserves the feature of
stakeholders having common access to their set of common transactions. The moment anyone
starts transacting on the system, a history of all interactions is immediately logged in the

12

 system. This high level of transparency and reliability is an important factor in building trust in
the integrity of the network not just from a regulatory oversight perspective, but can also
reduce counterparty risk for participants in the network. 8

Improving Resilience and Security in Transactional Systems
Blockchains have the potential to increase the resilience of systems and data storage due to its
distributed nature and its lack of a central point of. The ledger is owned by all participating
parties which means that in the event of failure everyone can keep their own copy of data and
transactions. This form of resilience and security provides the opportunity to create new
identity systems where users own the data, which remains universally consistent and cannot be
destroyed. Minimizing single points of failure in transactional systems is thus a key
differentiator when compared with existing or legacy systems which often have centralized
mechanisms of verification and security. 18

Challenges and Risks
Energy Consumption and Computer Processing Power
The proof-of-work competition also has the added cost of the wasted computational power and
energy used by all the miners involved in the process. The snapshot below depicts the Bitcoin
miners as currently consuming over 11 Terra Watt hours per year. To put this in context, Bitcoin
mining currently accounts for 0.05% of the world’s energy consumption, which could power
over a million households in the United States of America.

Scalability and Performance
As ledgers are designed to retain all previous transactions, the ledger’s size will increase. This
increase in size will continually need to be forecast against both the capabilities of the network
and the future behavior of the users. For example, the increasing popularity of Bitcoin is having
an exponential influence on the size of that blockchain. Sometimes referred to as “network
bloat” has the potential to detract from the technology’s utility if the size becomes too great for
everyday participants to readily use in a cost-effective way. 8

Interoperability
To realize the full benefits of distributed ledger technology, it will be critical for ledgers to be
able to exchange information with other ledgers and with legacy IT systems. In the short and
medium term, it is unclear whether businesses would be prepared to overhaul their existing
operations.
Blockchains are designed for decentralized control and not for decentralized semantics.
Blockchains don’t have the equivalent of JSON or HTTP for Blockchains. They are highly specific
to their application area and lack the flexibility required for a variety of different storage and

13

 provenance models. They possess no mechanism for extending their data model in a selfdiscoverable or machine-readable way. This makes tuning the existing monolithic blockchain
designs to meet new use cases a challenging, if not financially and technically prohibitive
undertaking.
Currently there are hundreds of fragmented blockchains competing, each with their
proprietary, non-interoperable standards and protocols. Wider adoption for blockchains
depends on enabling seamless interaction, not just between blockchain-based systems, but also
with existing IT infrastructure.
Assuming there will be many different types of blockchains and distributed ledgers, then it
follows that a generalized format for expressing and accessing these ledgers is desirable and a
requirement for interoperability. Transactions on blockchains will need to have stable URLs and
an equivalent of HTTP redirection to point to updated locations. Further standardization efforts
are needed to create URL schemes for blockchain transactions.

Privacy and Correlation
If illegal, personal, classified or otherwise objectionable data is entered onto a public blockchain
ledger, it is there forever. This means that situations may arise where information is recorded
inappropriately or illegally, and cannot be removed. The potential impacts of the permanence
and persistence of this information could potentially impact the privacy of individuals.
These potential privacy challenges will require thoughtful design and good governance to be
prevented and managed. Even improper use of simple metadata, can have unintended
consequences on privacy, allowing anyone to correlate data about an individual in a publicly
discoverable way. Strong governance models and controls around data security and privacy will
have to be examined carefully and have been demonstrated to be problematic. Information
security would need to consider the potential for breaches where previous responses and
mitigations are no longer effective. 8

1. Catalyzing an Ecosystem for Growth and Collaboration
Essential Questions
•
•

What role should government play in developing an ecosystem?
What unique areas of opportunity can we capitalize on in Illinois?

The State of Illinois as a Catalyst for Growth
Illinois regards its role in the development of the blockchain ecosystem as one which supports
the distinct needs of the respective ecosystem stakeholders: entrepreneurs, capital providers,
developers, governments, and academics to support and encourage the creation and growth of

14

 blockchain companies in Illinois. To accomplish this mission the Illinois Blockchain Initiative
created the role of the State of Illinois Blockchain Business Liaison, which is responsible for the
engagement of these stakeholders within the ecosystem to identify and conclusively work to
resolve their respective needs. As noted in the Tapscott Group’s 2017 Blockchain Corridor
Report: “many entrepreneurs are seeing a healthy dialogue with government, and a focus on
governance more broadly, as a good thing. Companies like Coinbase, Circle and Gemini have
joined trade organizations, and some even maintain close relations emerging governance
institutions”. 16
Reciprocally, the Illinois Blockchain Initiative has taken the unique step of directly joining
blockchain industry participants in membership within industry organizations and blockchain
consortiums such as the Chamber of Digital Commerce, R3, Hyperledger, the Enterprise
Ethereum Alliance and the Chicago Blockchain Center. The access to current market knowledge
and highly regarded subject matter participants, which these industry organizations and
consortium memberships provide, ensure the Illinois Blockchain Initiative is highly informed
and thus well positioned to execute effective strategy to catalyze an ecosystem for growth and
collaboration.

Areas of Opportunity for Illinois
Illinois is uniquely positioned to take a leadership role in the development of blockchain
technology due to the critical mass of industries leveraging blockchain technology located in
Illinois (financial services, insurance, supply chain and logistics etc.), access to talent, support of
entrepreneurship, and collaboration with enterprises.
Further supporting Illinois exceptional position to become the home of blockchain technology,
Deloitte’s 2017 Global FinTech Hub Ranking Report placed Chicago as a top five global fintech
hub, outperforming cities like Hong Kong, Zurich and Sydney: “Chicago acts as the epicenter for
all FinTech activity in the Midwest, representing well over 20,000 financial institutions. It is
home to two fifths of the top business universities in the US and over 6% of the Chicago
workforce are focused on the financial ecosystem contributing to its already significant talent
pool.
With government support, Chicago companies are able to quickly innovate to create
groundbreaking technology”. Notably the Deloitte report explicitly articulated the Illinois
government’s support of blockchain technology: “over the next 12 months, we expect to see
state and local government partnering with the private sector and NGOs to pursue greater
adoption of blockchain as well as creating an innovation friendly environment. 6

Fostering a Talent Pipeline
Ensuring that businesses have access to the right employees and skill sets, a pipeline, is
strategically important because it has a long-term talent-supply focus, which means that critical
jobs can be filled faster and with higher quality and more interested prospects. The cost of

15

 talent is the largest expense for most firms, and the quality of that tech talent is becoming one
of the most important considerations.
In a 2017 CBRE Report: Scoring Tech Talent in North America, noted that the Chicago area is the
fourth-ranked market in the country for tech degrees, with 7,866 degree completions from
2014-2015, demonstrating a growth of 15.6 percent from 2011-2015, trailing only New York,
Washington, D.C. and Los Angeles. Furthermore, Chicago was among the best value markets for
tech talent, due to its moderate labor costs (averaging $95,180 for software developers) and
“very-high”-quality labor pool.
Blockchain technology talent pools will require education in computer science and engineering.
The University of Illinois system graduates more computer science and computer engineering
students than CalTech, MIT, Stanford and Berkley combined. Furthermore, University of Illinois
Urbana Champaign is ranked as the #5 top undergraduate schools for computer engineering by
US News College Rankings. Although Illinois is well positioned to leverage its world class
academic institutions, the Illinois Blockchain Initiative can provide additional bespoke
blockchain education and programming outside of academia to supplement the talent pool.23
The Illinois Blockchain Initiative has been and is positioned to continue to be an effective
mechanism to facilitate educational workshops and conferences in which experienced
practitioners and experts provide knowledge, specific insight and practical application and
fosters grassroots innovation through hackathons national challenges, boot camps, and
accelerators. Looking forward, the Illinois Blockchain Initiative will partner with educational
institutions to incorporate blockchain curriculum into schools and colleges and to support
blockchain workforce development.

Supporting Entrepreneurship
The government is well placed to support blockchain technology entrepreneurship by providing
fiscal and educational resources to startups. The State of Illinois currently provides fiscal
resources such as the recently renewed Angel Investment Tax Credit and R&D Tax Credit
programs. It also provides educational resources such as the Small Business Development
Center network, and has funded collaborative spaces which ease entrance into
entrepreneurship such as 1871, MATTER and UILabs/DMDII. The Illinois Blockchain Initiative is a
founding member of the Chicago Blockchain Center, created in June 2017, where services are
focused on providing bespoke programming and education to the various segments of the local
blockchain community.
Even as the government supports blockchain entrepreneurs’ efforts to advance the technology,
there is still a need to come up with new applications that will broaden the technology’s appeal.
The Illinois Blockchain Initiative will play a supporting role in the identification of the most
important applications and opportunities for blockchain technology in business and
government. In doing so, the Illinois Blockchain Initiative will build relationships with

16

 entrepreneurs and leaders that will in turn foster a supportive environment for startups and
investment in the blockchain community.

Collaborating with Enterprises
The collaboration between corporations and startups has become crucial. Corporates
collaborate with startups to fast-track disruptive, game-changing products and services and
startups leverage corporates advantages in procurement, distribution, manufacturing, and sales
and marketing. With 37 Fortune 500 companies headquartered in Illinois, Illinois is well
positioned to connect the startup community residing in the network of over 100 incubators,
accelerators, co-working spaces and academic labs (such as Built in Chicago, Clean Energy Trust,
Energy Foundry, iBIO Institute, the Illinois Technology Association, and facilities such as 1871,
MATTER, mHUB, and TechNexus) to these world class corporate partners.

2. Governance, Law and Distributed Economies
Essential Questions
● How can legislators ensure distributed ledger systems balance enduring policy goals
while also mitigating new or unforeseen risks?
● Why might current regulatory and legal systems be redundant in a fully distributed
economy?

Governing Distributed Ledger Technology
Effectively governing blockchain and distributed ledger technology will require finding an
optimum balance between governance, regulation, legal code and technical code and will
require a unique mix of skills and perspectives from a variety of stakeholders, including lawyers,
mathematicians, business experts and computer scientists. For purposes of analysis
governance, regulation, legal code and technical code are defined below:
•
•
•
•

Governance: Rule-making by the owners or participants of a system with the purpose of
safeguarding private interests.
Regulation: Rule-making by an outside authority tasked with representing the broader
interests of the public.
Legal Code: Rules consisting of legal obligations set by either statute, administrative
code or regulatory guidance.
Technical Code: Rules defined in systems and code, executed and enforced by software
and protocols. 18

 Legislative Recommendations
Illinois’ lack of “blockchain legislation” to date should not be viewed as a failure to act, but
rather, as a recognition that many activities, transactions, agreements and events facilitated by
the technology are probably already legal, so long as they are performed in good faith, without
deception, and can be proven. For example, the state statutes governing county land records
offices (55 ILCS 5/3-5005.2) provide that “...The Recorder shall have the right to select the
computer or micrographic system to be used for document storage and retrieval.” The Cook
County Recorder of Deeds interprets this to mean that if the office so chooses, it can implement
a blockchain or distributed database to store records without need for a state law to authorize
it.
Illinois has instead chosen a more restrained regulatory path, actively studying design principles
rather than simply envisioning every possible use case and affirming its “legality.” It can also be
tempting to make a list of all the things the private sector can’t or shouldn’t do with blockchain
in the name of consumer protection, but it seems that such a heavy-handed approach is more
likely to send the message that Illinois is not friendly towards this technology.
Recommendations that follow will thus reflect necessary changes to the way information is
submitted, stored and transmitted.
The recommendations available in appendix A are heavily focused in the areas of state law that
affect property law and public recording, mainly because that is the area most heavily studied
in Illinois thus far (see Cook County Recorder of Deeds Blockchain Final Report, May 31, 2017). It
is the opinion of the Task Force that because property law continues to rely on archaic
standards and paper-based regulatory guidance, that an overhaul of these sections could
provide impetus and direction to lawmakers interested in carrying similar updates into other
Sections of law.
It is beyond the abilities and mandate of this Task Force to analyze every corner of the Illinois
Compiled Statutes and every opportunity. It is also important to remember that the purpose of
this Task Force is to analyze opportunities and risks for government usage, which means this
report will not directly consider legislation that is tangential to the delivery of government
services.

3. Creating a Hyperconnected Government
Essential Questions
● How can distributed ledger technology help governments deliver more responsive,
trusted and integrated public services?
● How can these technologies be utilized with other emerging technologies to radically
rethink how government services are delivered?

18

 Building a Hyperconnected Government with Blockchains
An important function of government is to maintain trusted information about individuals,
organizations, assets, and activities. Local, regional and national agencies are charged with
maintaining records that include, for instance, birth and death dates or information about
marital status, business licensing, property transfers, or criminal activity. Managing and using
these data can be complicated, even for advanced governments. Some records exist only in
paper form, and if changes need to be made in official registries, citizens often must appear in
person to do so. Individual agencies tend to build their own silos of data and informationmanagement protocols, which preclude other parts of the government from using them. And,
of course, these data must be protected against unauthorized access or manipulation, with no
room for error.
Blockchain technology could simplify the management of trusted information, making it easier
for government agencies to access and use critical public-sector data while maintaining the
security of this information. At a high level blockchain and distributed ledger-enabled
technologies enable government efficiencies in three ways:
•
•
•

Integrating government services with distributed identity
Efficiently and effectively managing the flow of digitized assets
Combining blockchain with other emerging technologies to “reinvent public services”

Integrating Government Services with Identity
What is Identity?
Identity is a collection of attributes about an individual. Identity attributes can relate to an
individual’s preferences, personality or more sensitive information such as biometrics,
healthcare records or criminal history. Attributes can be collected and used for a particular
purpose such as verifying an individual is over the age of 21 in order to legally purchase agerestricted goods. Identity attributes can be broadly categorized into three groups: inherent,
accumulated and assigned. Some identity attributes rarely change while others change
frequently.

19

 The Role of Identity in Government
Government has an important role to play in the development of any digital identity ecosystem.
Identity is not only foundational to nearly every government service, but is the basis for trust
and legitimacy in the public sector. It is the starting point of confidence in citizen’s interactions
with government and is a critical enabler of service delivery, security, privacy, and public safety
activities. How identity attributes are collected, used, managed, and secured is and will
continue to be of critical interest to leaders in the public sector charged with protecting the
rights of citizens, ensuring privacy, and ensuring national security and public safety.
In government, a variety of attributes are used to verify a person’s identity, allowing them to
gain access to government services. Government also provide registers for recording of
essential personal identity information. Despite being the primary registers personal
identifiable information, government identities are often siloed in databases across agencies,
increasing opportunities for fraud, security breaches and errors. 8
Government identity attributes can be organized into four categories based on their general
characteristics and types of services they enable:

Core Attributes
Inherent or assigned personal identity attributes that are generally registered by a government
authority. These registers are maintained by entities such as the post office or vital records
office.
Core Identity Attributes
Legal Name (First, Middle, Last, Suffix)
Date of Birth
Physical and Mailing Address
Gender

Spouse(Marriage or Civil Union)
Mother/Father/Sibling
Email(s)
Phone Number(s)

Birth Certificate
Death Certificate
Organ Donor
Criminal History

20

 Service Identifiers
Identifiers assigned to individuals after gaining access to certain government services,
mandatory enrollment in government programs, or to exercise legally ordained rights and
obligations such as paying taxes or voting.
Service Identifiers
Medicaid/Medicare number
Social Security Number
Tax ID

Unemployment Insurance ID
Voter ID
Veteran ID

Passport (Citizenship)
Prisoner/Correctional ID
Student ID

Ownerships
Legal instruments that allow individuals or entities to track manage and maintain possession
and ownership of high-value physical assets. Ownerships and transfer of ownership is generally
maintained by relevant federal, state and local governments in asset registries.
Title/Ownerships
Land Title

Vehicle Title (Car/Boat)

Firearm Owner’s ID (FOID)

Attestations
Information corroborated or certified by a government authority. Attestations either (1)
provide individuals permission to perform certain tasks within government or outside of
government or (2) substantiate qualifications that were achieved.
Attestations
Driver’s License (Other Vehicles)
Professional/Occupational License
Continuing Education Certifications

Concealed Carry Firearm Permit Fishing License
Academic Credential
Travel Visa
Pilot License
Military Service

Illinois’ PKI Infrastructure
At a high level, Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is a set of requirements that allow for the
creation of digital signatures. Through PKI, each digital signature transaction includes a pair of
cryptographic keys: a private key and a public key. The private key, is not shared and is used
only by the signer to electronically sign documents. The public key is openly available and used
by those who need to validate the signer’s electronic signature. PKI enforces additional
requirements, such as the Certificate Authority (CA), a digital certificate, end-user enrollment
software, and tools for managing, renewing, and revoking keys and certificates.

21

 In 2001, the State of Illinois received certification as a self-signed Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
Certificate Authority (CA) and Registration Authority (RA) following an independent audit.
Currently the Department of Innovation and Technology (DoIT), by legislative directive, is the
sole source of digital certificates for State of Illinois agencies, boards, commissions, universities,
municipal governments and business partners.
Illinois' PKI is governed by roles, policies and procedures to ensure the appropriate
management of digital certificates and public-key encryption. Illinois' PKI functions through the
creation and issuance of cryptographic keys by the Illinois Certificate Authority (CA) which
provides a public key for distribution throughout the user base and a secret key for private use
by the entity (or individual) to which it belongs.
Despite the incremental benefits that PKI affords government services, it cannot be viewed as a
cure all data security and identity management solution, rather it is one piece of the puzzle.

Why Decentralized Identity Management on Blockchains?
Related to innovations in blockchain and distributed ledger technologies, decentralized public
key infrastructure (DPKI) leveraging blockchains as a machine-readable key-value store is
rapidly emerging as a more resilient form of managing public key infrastructure for personal
identity data.
The blockchain-enabled identity model relies on the combination of four important standards:
decentralized identifiers (DIDs), DID documents, verifiable claims and blockchain/distributed
ledgers. decentralized identifiers (DIDs) are stored on a blockchain or distributed ledger with a
corresponding DID document where collectively they form a key-value pair relationship **(not
to be confused with a cryptographic key but rather linked data items: a key, which is a unique
identifier for some item of data, and the value, which is either the data that is identified or a
pointer to the location of that data).
The DID acts as a globally unique index and the DID document contains a number of essential
items including (1) a public key, (2) service endpoint (3) authentication mechanism (how a user
cryptographically asserts they are the owner or controller of the DID/DID Document) and (4)
ways in which keys can be revoke, rotated or replaced.

22

 Decentralized public key infrastructure affords two improvements over existing public key
infrastructure:
Decentralized Resilience
It does not rely on any single Certificate Authority to check for validity of public keys, rather it
uses a globally available blockchain ledger for verification. This has the capability to reduce Man
in the Middle (MITM) attacks that are difficult to detect and reduces the risk of a single
Certificate Authority being a single point of failure.
Embedding PKI in Each Transaction
DPKI also leverages blockchains to make public key infrastructure more usable. Blockchains by
nature require a built-in public key infrastructure mechanism which requires users to use public
key infrastructure for every transaction, and if “wrapped” in a well-designed user experience,
invisible to the end user. Furthermore, the key pair is pseudonymous, not revealing the actor’s
actual identity. However, supplemental information, such as name, contact information or
professional credentials can be associated with these pairwise unique public-private key pair,
merging on-chain and off-chain identity.

23

 A Framework for Government-led Decentralized Identity

A citizen-centric digital identity model based on distributed ledger technologies could be used
to consolidate disparate data that currently exists across multiple agencies and layers of
government into a network centered around a citizen’s or business’ credentials, licenses and
identity attributes. It would enable citizens to view their public service identity via an identity
app on their smartphone and share relevant data with government to access public services. 3
This new model would reimagine the relationship between state and individual, as government
would become the verifier, rather than the custodian, of people’s public service identity.
Government would move from providing data storage to verifying identity, allowing users to
store access to personal data securely on devices.
Protecting personal data in this manner makes it increasingly difficult and economically
disadvantageous to hack because each citizen’s data stored in encrypted in the cloud with the
only keys to unlock the data stored on each citizen’s personal device. An attack on this model
would require hackers to simultaneously gain access to person data in the cloud, blockchain
and a majority of the citizen’s devices.
The distributed nature of blockchain means that all departments on the network agree to ‘one
version of the truth when information is added. Furthermore, if designed well, distributed
ledgers have the potential to provide answers that do not present a risk to user privacy. These
ledgers allow citizens to share selectively share verified attributes of an identity along with the
provenance of the verification or source document. 8

24

 Efficiently and Effectively Managing Digital Assets
Government plays an important role in the distribution and administration of benefit and
entitlement programs for citizens who meet certain eligibility requirements. Examples of
programs include health care, welfare, unemployment, and housing assistance. Government
could leverage blockchain and distributed ledger technology to distribute benefits more
efficiently, reducing entitlement fraud and increasing asset transparency for taxpayers.
Effectively managing assets in government can be thought of in two ways:
•
•

Digitizing physical assets (“tokenizing assets”) to increase asset transparency, improving
liquidity and policy outcomes for incentive programs or titled assets.
Managing revenue collection, or benefit and incentive distribution on a shared ledger
with smart contracts to provide granular control over and real-time insight into complex
administrative processes.

Digitizing Assets
Smart contract enabled distributed ledgers such as the Ethereum blockchain provide a standard
for granularly representing physical assets on a blockchain in the form of a “token”.
Representing items such as shares, cars, property, or tax credits as tokens on a blockchain
allows assets to be transacted, fractionalized or collateralized similar to a share or other
financial instrument.
All users, transactions and data are digitally recorded on the blockchain, creating an immutable
record. The irrefutable record can dramatically reduce the cost and complexity of auditing,
reconciliation and issue resolution as there is a clear and traceable audit trail of transactions,
data and user interactions. Not only can this can lead to a material reduction in paperwork and
more efficient asset transfer processes, but by significantly reducing transaction costs,
blockchains could help public sector open up credit and securities markets for whole new
classes of lower-value or non-traditional assets. There is also a unique opportunities to create
liquid secondary securities markets where assets can be fractionalized and traded as futures,
options, or shares similar to oil, corn or other commodities.
Examples of public sector assets that could be digitized include:
Loyalty Rewards
Digital Currencies or Tokens
Prison Commissary Funds

Pension Liabilities
Municipal Bonds
Affordable Housing Vouchers

Tax Credits
Unclaimed Property
Highway Tolls

Use Case Snapshot: Tokenizing Tax Credits
Tax credits could be categorically “tokenized” on a blockchain to improve market visibility and
ensure asset provenance. Government could also open an exchange where the “tax credit
tokens” could be traded, improving their liquidity and ensuring the efficacy of the policy goal
that the credit incentivizes. A blockchain-based system of management also allows aggregators

25

 granularly pool credit (or derivatives of) while maintaining direct visibility into its initial
issuance.

Social Benefits and Incentive Program Distribution
The State could also consider creating a blockchain platform to increase efficiencies and reduce
costs for companies to comply with the State’s workers compensation system. With the State’s
creation of a private permissioned blockchain consortium for workers compensation, all
transactions are logged, including information on the date, time and participants, as well as the
amount of every single transaction in an immutable record. Each party in the network would be
party to a complete copy of the blockchain, and the transactions are verified using advanced
cryptographic algorithms. This is the equivalent of a free notary present at each transaction.
The employer’s workers compensation insurance companies pay for workers compensation
healthcare expenses to certified medical practitioners in the system.
Similarly, many government grants and incentives programs are eligibility based, where a grant
is either approved or denied based on the meeting of certain requirements. The difficulty in this
process arises due to the data being held within disparate government and private entities,
making the eligibility process time consuming and resource intensive to get right. Rolling up all
of these systems into one distributed ledger simplifies the eligibility process. Upon eligibility, a
smart-contract can trigger a grant payment to the recipient instantly.
A distributed ledger is an ideal technology to supplement the Medicaid enrollment and
eligibility process. In this scenario, the State of Illinois maintains a distributed roster (ledger) of
eligible Medicaid members. Data is fed into this ledger from various sources, including the
member’s employer or former employer and records from the federal and state government.
This allows the eligibility status of a member to stay in constant sync. Should a member fall out
of coverage once they find a stable job, a smart-contract would automatically terminate their
enrollment in the program. A distributed ledger solution simplifies the system by rolling up the
currently siloed databases and connecting them to shared eligibility ledger.

26

 SNAP/TANF
Medicaid/Medicare
Unemployment Insurance
Worker’s Compensation

Student Loans
Disaster Recovery Grants
Research Grants
Agricultural Price Support

Housing Support
Tax Collection
Municipal Grants
Conservation Grants

Social Benefits Distribution Use Case Snapshot
An interesting application could be an “entitlements digital currency” for benefit programs such
as food stamps. Providing a digital identity verification would help the program accurately
verify applicants and reduce fraud. Smart contracts could precisely determine eligibility
efficiently and effectively. An additional “healthy eating token” incentive system could be
offered to achieve ancillary health policy goals, providing additional cost savings for other
health benefits systems.

Convergence: Reimagining Public Services
Illinois could also explore the feasibility of integrating other emerging technologies such as IoT
or Artificial Intelligence with blockchain to (1) develop new products and (2) reinvent traditional
services. New products could include peer-to-peer service marketplaces that monetize nontraditional datasets. Reinventing govt. services could involve using a combination of AI and
smart contracts to automate complex eligibility processes or to re-engineer social benefits
programs so that funds are pre-distributed to recipients.
For example, an interesting application of a blockchain-enabled public service application would
be a sharing economy public transit service provided by the State of Illinois. With autonomous
vehicles on the horizon, it is entirely possible to have a state-operated on-demand vehicle
service that is hosted on a distributed ledger. In fact, private companies such as Arcade City are
already providing rides to consumers by using a distributed ledger.

Use Case Snapshot - Device Marketplace for Waste Management
By combining blockchain, IoT, and big data, governments could create demand-based
marketplaces for tasks such as waste management, recycling services or snow removal. Sensors
data could be fed into a blockchain system, where it interacts with smart contracts to

27

 determine demand autonomously. Price would be determined by sensors and service providers
are sourced automatically based on conditions in the smart contract.

Use Case Snapshot – Disaster Recovery Grant Distribution
Many grants are based on eligibility criteria and are approved or denied based on a person or
entity meeting pre-defined requirements. Rolling up all systems into smart-contracts managed
by a distributed ledger could radically simplify the eligibility process. Upon eligibility, a smartcontract could trigger a grant payment instantly. For example, disaster recovery “smart
contracts” could use a combination of computer vision data and IoT sensor data from drones
providing an “oracle” to automate the disaster recovery eligibility process.

Blockchain in Government Pilot Database
Over the past year, the Illinois Blockchain Initiative has compiled a database of over 200
blockchain and distributed ledger technology pilots, projects and strategies announced by
public sector entities. The database is an overview of how government at various levels globally

28

 are employing blockchain technology in their efforts to govern, improve the competitiveness of
their economy and also deliver high-quality services in a more efficient manner.
The public sector is one of the most active blockchain sector’s exploring the technology for a
wide variety of use cases. Adoption of the technology in the public section is accelerating at an
extraordinary pace.
The database can be found at the following link: http://bit.ly/govt-tracker-database

29

 Appendix A: Legislative Recommendations
Reconcile State Digital Signature Laws With UETA
The Uniform Law Commission created the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act in 1999, which
provides standards for retention of electronic records and the validity and use of electronic
signatures. Though Illinois has some statutory language allowing electronic signatures, a push
towards a blockchain-based system is an opportunity to again review whether Illinois should
make an effort to fully join the rest of the nation and place itself on a path towards more
efficient and secure paperless recordkeeping.

Modernization of Notarial Statutes
The Uniform Law Commission has created the Revised Uniform Law on Notarial Acts (RULONA)
to reflect the changing nature of technology. A shift towards allowing electronic or video
notarizing, perhaps tracked and verified on a public blockchain, would help modernize Illinois
law in a clear direction towards electronic commerce and away from the ease of fraud that can
be committed by paper-and-stamp methods. A holistic look at state notary laws should include
an analysis of remote video notarization enablement, biometric based notarization as well as
other technology enabled methods which would be a move that would better facilitate
electronic transactions.

Self-Notarization of Documents
One of the basic functions a blockchain can provide is proving that a specific computer file or
document existed at a certain point in time (akin to a “poor man’s copyright”). Allowing
documents that have had their hash values permanently timestamped and embedded into a
known, trusted and public blockchain to be admitted as evidence in state courts would create
efficiencies by removing the need for a lawyer to visit an office, purchase paper, then have that
office expend taxpayer resources to physically mark that printout as “certified.” This is also a
step towards streamlining Illinois’ public land record to be a record of text-data, as opposed to
a registry of PDF scans of legal instruments that must be independently verified and inspected
each time they are used. A specific instrument’s SHA 256 hash fingerprint could be included in
the public record as a way to avoid having government foot the expense of storing terabytes of
bulky PDF or TIFF files.

Clarity to “Pure Notice” Conveyance and Recording Statute
A central issue in the legality and validity of property records centers on whether a state is a
“race to the courthouse” state, a “notice” state, or a “race-notice” state. This refers to how
competing disputes by “subsequent purchasers” as to ownership of a property are resolved,
focusing on whether ownership claims that are unrecorded and thus unknown to subsequent
purchasers adversely affect these bona fide purchasers who took title in good faith with no

30

 knowledge of previous claims or interest. It is the opinion of this Task Force that the case law
that has misinterpreted the plain language of Illinois’ “pure notice” statute to be a “racenotice” should be invalidated by clear instructions of the General Assembly, simply by adding a
clarifying statement to the existing statute. 17

Require Claims Against Real Estate to be Publicly Recorded
Though clarifying the notice requirements and effects in Illinois will go a long way towards
shaping a logical public record and maximizing its benefit, allowing valid claims to remain
unrecorded (including those by local governments) is something that should be re-examined in
our modern age of computers, electronic recording, and overnight mail. It is no longer a burden
for a person with a valid claim to simply place that claim in the public record, and it must be
examined whether allowing uncertainty to exist in property records is truly serving the interests
of taxpayers and property owners. This will make Illinois’ public land record a true record that
can be easily agreed upon, and not simply a record of those interests claimants felt like
recording. A single record of claims will make title research easier and cheaper, and make a
transition to a distributed ledger more attainable and valuable.

Reproduction Versus Storage
If the goal of a public land record is an accurate description of events between private parties, a
system that manually recreates those records does not achieve this goal. Section 3-5010 of the
Recorders Act, entitled “Duties of recorder”, refers to duties related to “instruments in writing.”
This Section heavily focuses on reproducing written submissions and implies that a recorder
must always “reproduce” what has already been created. This leads to inefficiencies and errors.
A possible update to this section could allow for direct submission of plain-text data that was
used to create the transaction into the public record, which would technically not be a
“reproduction,” but would provide 100% accuracy in the record of what actually occurred. As a
background, recorder’s office manually create indices of submitted records, a process that is
vulnerable to human error and results in discrepancies that must be “insured” at the taxpayers’
own expense. Such an update would not preclude private parties, through their settlement
agents or attorneys, from providing hash-values for the lengthy contracts used in the
transaction, allowing them to be used for evidentiary purposes in the future without requiring
that costly client-server storage models be used to maintain millions of pages of unnecessary
information.

Omnibus Real Estate Records Submission Modernization
Though Illinois law allows documents to be electronically submitted, industry conventions, and
in some cases, the plain language of the law, confines practice to paper-based methods. For
example, in outlining some duties of a Recorder, the law states “...No recorder shall record any
instrument affecting title to real estate unless the name and address of the person who
prepared and drafted such instruments is printed, typewritten or stamped on the face thereof
in a legible manner…” (5/3-5022). A focused effort to update these laws to allow text-only

31

 records that have no “face” but still contain the needed information would be a great facilitator
of blockchain-based recordkeeping. This inquiry should also focus on the Conveyances Act, and
any section that specifically states how a record must be worded and constructed. For example,
language such as “..the name and address of the preparer shall accompany any record affecting
title to real estate…” would begin a shift away from paper-based modes of document
submission and retention.

Statewide Unique Real Property Parcel Numbering System
For a blockchain-based property registry to work, every parcel of real estate must have a
unique number to identify it (much like the interstate and international VIN system for
automobiles). Earlier this year, the Real Estate Standards Organization (RESO), issued guidance
for creating a universal Property Unique Identifier for real estate, similar to the VIN number for
a vehicle. It combines ISO Country and FIPS County codes and incorporates the local unique
identifier to create a system to uniquely number and identify parcels across a state. Legislation
could simply adopt this standard and require counties to report whether they use a unique
numbering system and adopt one if it does not. 12
