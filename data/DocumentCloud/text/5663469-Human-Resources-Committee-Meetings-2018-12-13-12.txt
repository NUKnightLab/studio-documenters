 Improve / Reduce Average Time to Hire
 HR Activity Report – Open Vacancies
 Hiring Snapshot
Wayne Wright, Director of Organizational Development and Training, provided additional information on the
subject of annual performance evaluations. These will be done each year for each employee between October and
December. Chair Richardson-Lowry stated that, in her experience, in an organization this size, she has found that
doing them in a specific period of time is better than doing them on each employee’s hiring date anniversary,
particularly in light of the fact that there is a cultural shift that is happening in the organization. She added that it
might be helpful to do a comparative analysis of what other large comparable institutions are doing in that regard.
During the discussion of the information contained in the Hiring Snapshot, Director Driscoll stated that in
previous reports, metrics regarding nursing vacancies and nursing filled positions have been included; she
inquired whether this information can be provided. Board Chair Hammock requested that those metrics regarding
vacancies filled in the Finance Department also be included in that information. Ms. Pryor responded that she will
provide an update with that information after the meeting.
During the discussion of separations of employees relating to retirements, Chair Richardson-Lowry inquired
whether a notice period has been formalized for departures. Ms. Pryor responded that, for the majority of the
employees, that would need to be negotiated with the labor unions.
