PROVIDER CONTRACTS TO IMPLEMENT AND ADMINISTER A SUMMER YOUTH EMPLOYMENT
PROGRAM
To the Honorable Board of Commissioners:
RECOMMENDATION
It is recommended that the Board of Commissioners ("Board") authorize the Chief Executive Officer
or his designee to: 1) accept a grant award and execute an Intergovernmental Agreement with the
Chicago Department of Family and Support Services (“DFSS”) in the amount of $1,158,300 for the
Summer Youth Employment Program (“SYEP”). This grant award from DFSS may only be utilized to
pay wages for 2,100 youth workers; and 2) increase the Resident Services budget in order to amend
contracts with CHA’s current FamilyWorks providers in an additional aggregate amount not-toexceed $300,000 to implement and administer SYEP.
The Deputy Chief Housing Officer of Resident Services, the Office of the General Counsel and the
Department of Procurement and Contracts have completed all necessary due diligence to support
the submission of this initiative and recommend the approval of this item accordingly.
CORPORATE GOAL
The Summer Youth Employment Program supports CHA’s corporate goal of empowering
individuals for success in the global economy while providing targeted services to residents at
critical milestones in their lives, while living in a safe, decent and sustainable housing portfolio.
FUNDING
CHA General Fund and Grant Funds
DFSS SYEP Grant Award (2,100 Youth Worker Wages):
CHA Funds (Program Implementation & Administration):

$ 1,158,300
$ 300,000

COMPLIANCE INFORMATION
Compliance is only applicable to CHA funds for program implementation and administration;
compliance is not applicable to the grant award from DFSS that is used to fund wages for CHA
youth. Compliance information will be determined and administered after the total number of
SYEP slots and budget for all FamilyWorks agencies are finalized.

 GENERAL BACKGROUND
CHA participates in the One Summer Chicago initiative, which is a collaborative effort between the
City of Chicago, Cook County and the civic and business communities, to provide summer
programming for CHA youth. As a partner in One Summer Chicago, CHA will be providing paid
academic enhancement and workforce development opportunities to 3,000 CHA youth in 2015.
For the past three years, as part of the One Summer Chicago initiative, CHA has collaborated with
DFSS to provide paid summer opportunities to CHA youth through the SYEP program. In March
2015, CHA received notice of a grant award from DFSS in an amount not-to-exceed $1,158,300, to
provide wages for 2,100 youth and young adults (ages 16-24) to participate in SYEP. The DFSS grant
stipulates that the funds may only be used for youth worker wages.
Based on past years, CHA anticipated receiving a grant award to administer SYEP for a total of 1,600
youth and included the funds needed to operate the SYEP program within the existing FamilyWorks
contracts. However, in order to implement the additional 500 SYEP slots, CHA needs to increase
the Resident Services budget in the amount of $300,000 and use this funding to increase the
contracts with CHA’s current FamilyWorks providers.
CHA is seeking authorization for the following actions:
 Accept a grant award of $1,158,300 from DFSS to pay wages to 2,100 CHA youth workers;
and
 Increase the Resident Services budget in order to amend contracts with CHA’s current
FamilyWorks providers in an additional aggregate amount not-to-exceed $300,000 to
implement and administer SYEP. The 2015 FamilyWorks providers are:










Beacon Therapeutic School (Contract No. 11522)
Catholic Charities (Contract No. 11523)
Centers for New Horizons (Contract No. 11524)
Employment & Employer Services (Contract No. 11525)
Heartland Human Care Services (Contract No. 11526)
Holsten Real Estate Development Corporation (Contract No. 11527)
Metropolitan Family Services (Contract No. 11528)
Near West Side Community Development Corporation (Contract No. 11529)
UCAN (Contract No. 11530)

CHA’s FamilyWorks providers were competitively procured in 2014 and SYEP was included as a
component of their scope of work. FamilyWorks providers have existing relationships with the
target population and possess the requisite experience needed to implement youth summer
workforce programs. FamilyWorks providers have been responsible for coordinating SYEP and
other similar grant-funded workforce programs for CHA youth since 2009. Individual contract
amendment amounts will be determined by the capacity of each organization and the number of
youth within their assigned regions.

 The intention of SYEP is to provide Chicago youth and young adults with safe, meaningful summer
experiences, while learning valuable and transferable skills that connect life lessons and academic
preparation, ultimately enhancing participants’ long-term employment prospects. Participants
receive ongoing job readiness instruction and career exploration integrated with a paid
employment placement for 6 weeks. FamilyWorks providers match CHA youth with employers
throughout Chicago, based on youth interest. Examples of industries from past years include food
service, retail, administrative work, and technology.
The Board action recommended in this item complies in all material respects with all applicable
CHA Board policies and all applicable federal (HUD) procurement laws.
The Deputy Chief Housing Officer of Resident Services concurs with the recommendation to accept
a grant award and execute an Intergovernmental Agreement with DFSS, and increase contracts
with FamilyWorks providers to implement SYEP.
The CEO/President recommends the Board: 1) accept a grant award and execute an
Intergovernmental Agreement with DFSS in the amount of $1,158,300 for a SYEP. This grant award
from DFSS may only be utilized to pay wages for 2,100 youth workers; and 2) increase the Resident
Services budget in order to amend contracts with CHA’s current FamilyWorks providers in an
additional aggregate amount not-to-exceed $300,000 to implement and administer SYEP.
