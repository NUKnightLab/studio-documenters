(Comments from Keith Harley)
In anticipation of tomorrow's call, I thought it might be helpful to compare-and-contrast the
environmental justice strategies of the federal agencies that parallel our Illinois counterparts:
Department of Transportation:

Department of Commerce:

Department of Health and Human Services:

Department of Interior:

Department of Energy:

I'm also attaching a summary I prepared of the U.S. EPA EJ strategies circa 1995, 2005 and today.
