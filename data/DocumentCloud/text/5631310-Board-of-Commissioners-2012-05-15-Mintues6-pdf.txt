 (Item B1)
The resolution for Item B1 approves Amendment No. 2 to Contract No. 1022 with the
Partnership for Transformation (PFT) for continued Construction and Program Management
Services. PFT has provided construction management services under Contract No. 1022 since
June 1, 2010. The CHA continues to require construction and program management services in
order to perform timely conversions of dwellings and non-dwellings units to meet Federal and
local accessibility requirements; successfully finish building upgrades to meet City of Chicago
life safety and high-rise regulations within the mandated deadlines; complete all activities under
the Capital Maintenance and Capital Improvement Programs; move forward with ongoing
rehabilitation projects; and effectively respond to any new activities that arise out of the Plan for
Transformation 2.0. PFT has become an integral part of the Capital Construction Department
management team and has provided satisfactory service during its base year and Option Year
No. 1, and the continuation of their construction management services is important to the timely
achievement of the CHA’s original Plan for Transformation goals and the successful transition to
any new goals established under the Plan for Transformation 2.0. Over the years PFT has built
up an intimate knowledge of CHA housing stock, has created strong relationships with resident
leaders, with CHA staff in other departments, with personnel at City of Chicago Departments
and with local political leaders. It has developed a familiarity with the General Contractors and
Prime Design Consultants currently under contract with the CHA.
RESOLUTION NO. 2012-CHA-32
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed Board Letter dated May 9, 2012
entitled “AUTHORIZATION TO EXECUTE AMENDMENT NO. 2 TO
CONTRACT
NO.
1022
WITH
THE
PARTNERSHIP
FOR
TRANSFORMATION, JV TO EXERCISE OPTION YEAR NO. 2 AND
MODIFY ORGANIZATIONAL STAFFING”;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to approve Amendment No. 02 to Contract No. 1022 with the
Partnership for Transformation, JV in the not-to-exceed amount of $3,320,777.00
for Option Year No. 2, including $1,915,847 originally proposed staffing levels,
the modifications to organizational staffing in the amount of $1,370,563 and an
increase in the not-to-exceed amount for reimbursables of $34,367. The contract
will be extended for the period of June 1, 2012 through May 31, 2013. The new
total contract value of Contract No. 1022 is the not-to-exceed amount of
$9,070,696.
This amendment is subject to the Contractor’s compliance with CHA’s
MBE/WBE/DBE, Section 3 resident hiring, and insurance requirements.

(Item B2)
The resolution for Item B2 approves Amendment No. 4 to Contract 9048 with Harley Ellis
Devereaux; Amendment No. 4 to Contract 9049 with Holabird & Root and Amendment No. 2 to
Contract 9050 with Globetrotters Engineering Corporation for additional Prime Design
Consulting services at various CHA properties. In order to meet the federally mandated deadline
requirement for ADA/504, comply in a cost effective manner with the Life Safety and High Rise
ordinance, and have design services available to meet the needs of the critical capital
maintenance projects (such as façade repairs and plumbing riser upgrades), staff determined
exercising Option Year One of the PDC contracts is in the best interest of the CHA. In addition,
the increase in the funding for the PDCs is essential if the CHA is to successfully complete the
Major Capital Projects Plan for 2012 and 2013. Without an increase in funding, the CHA will be
in jeopardy of missing critical construction deadlines due to insufficient PDC capacity for design
services. The total not-to-exceed amount of $10,736,250 will be distributed among the PDCs
using the original base contract percentages, which were developed based on the anticipated
amount of work to be performed in each region.

(Item B4)
The resolution for Item B4 approves contract award with Stateway Associates LLC for
Environmental Remediation Activities at the Park Boulevard Phase II Rental Development Site.
Pursuant to the development agreement, CHA is required to fund the cost of site remediation for
pre-existing conditions on the entire rental development site subject to certain rights to terminate

investigation studies were completed for the CHA-owned land included in the Phase IIB site.
These studies have identified certain environmental contaminants on the site that can be
effectively remediated with an “engineered barrier” approach. This is the approach that was
used on the first phase of construction at Park Boulevard, formerly the Stateway Gardens public
housing development. The estimated remediation costs for the Park Boulevard Phase IIB Rental
site is $562,514. CHA’s contractual responsibility for remediating foreseen and unforeseen
environmental conditions is capped at 200% of this estimated total cost and equals $1,125,028.

(Item C1)
The resolution for Item C1 approves award of contract to After School Matters (ASM), in an
amount not-to-exceed $330,000, to provide after school and out-of-school programs for a total of
315 public housing and HCV youth ages 14-18 during the summer and fall sessions of 2012 and
the spring session of 2013. This programming is essential to CHA’s youth by not only providing
safe year round out-of-school and after school opportunities, but also providing transferrable
social, academic and employment skills. ASM utilizes a three-tiered program model with preapprenticeship, apprenticeship and advanced apprenticeship cohorts, each requiring applicants to
possess a greater level of skill in the subject area upon entry into the program. Programs are led
by experienced, industry professionals who are able to provide participants with transferrable
skills in the specific program area and who are experienced in engaging and motivating teens.
Programs fall into one of five content areas: gallery, technology, words, science or sports.
Through the apprenticeship programs, youth are empowered with career readiness skills such as
accountability, self-control, initiative, teamwork, and problem solving. In order to create a
continuum of programming that can reach some of Chicago’s most underserved teens, ASM
partners with city sister agencies and more than 100 community based organizations throughout
Chicago neighborhoods. ASM and CHA have collaborated each year throughout the months
prior to the start of the summer session in order to determine communities in need of additional
programs, as well as identifying the general types of programs in which youth are interested in
participating. ASM utilizes CHA’s feedback on service gaps and independently identifies
appropriate programs to be implemented in these communities.
RESOLUTION NO. 2012-CHA-38
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the
Board Letter dated May 9, 2012, entitled “RECOMMENDATION TO ENTER
INTO A CONTRACT WITH AFTER SCHOOL MATTERS TO PROVIDE
PRE-APPRENTICESHIP AND APPRENTICESHIP YOUTH EMPLOYMENT
PROGRAMS FOR CHA YOUTH”;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY

designee to enter into a contract with After School Matters (“ASM”) to provide
pre-apprenticeship and apprenticeship youth employment programs for a total of
315 CHA youth ages 14-18 for the period of June 1, 2012 through May 31, 2013

In April 2012, CHA received notice of a grant award not-to-exceed $800,000 from the
Department of Family and Support Services (DFSS) to provide stipends for 1,280 youth and
young adults ages 14-24 to participate in a Summer Youth Employment Program (SYEP). The
SYEP is being implemented as a part of One Summer Chicago, which is a collaborative effort
between the City of Chicago, Cook County and the civic and business communities to provide
summer programming for youth. The DFSS grant agreement with DFSS stipulates that the grant
funds may only be used for youth worker stipends. Therefore, CHA must match the grant
funding, from DFSS to cover the cost of program coordination, implementation and supervision.
Accordingly, the resolution for Item C2 approves acceptance of grant award in the amount of
$800,000 and approves an additional amount of $800,000 to implement and administer the
Summer Youth Employment Program for a total amount of $1,600,000 for the DFSS SYEP. The
following contractors: Centers for New Horizons, Employment & Employer Services, Inc.,
Heartland Human Care Services, Metropolitan Family Services Network, Near West Side
Community Development Corporation, and Uhlich Children’s Advantage Network will
implement the Program and will be responsible for identifying worksites, recruiting, assessing
and placing youth workers, providing job readiness training, training for youth supervisors and
providing additional supervision and program administration as necessary. The contractors are
the only agencies that have established relationships with the target population and possess the
requisite experience in providing similar youth summer workforce programs, as these providers
have been responsible for coordinating other similar grant-funded workforce programs for CHA
youth since 2009.

Employment and Employer Services (E&ES) to provide workforce services for a minimum of
138 CHA residents and Housing Choice Voucher participants. The Transitional Jobs (TJ)
program offered by E&ES is aligned with CHA’s corporate strategies of helping families
maximize their potential and, when ready, move towards economic independence and begin the
transition out of public housing. The Contract with E&ES is currently the only TJ program
specifically for CHA residents who have little to no work history. Other funded TJ programs in
the City of Chicago have specific target populations (e.g. ex-offender, homeless). This specific
type of program needs to continue in order to address the needs of this population, while
Resident Services develops business plans through Plan 2.0 to redefine future services.
Throughout the contract, E&ES has been successful in providing literacy services to participants
and placing residents in permanent, unsubsidized jobs.
