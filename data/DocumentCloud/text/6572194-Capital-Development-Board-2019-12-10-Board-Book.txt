Project History: This project consists of the construction of a 200 bed, 5 story precast concrete veterans’ home, located
at the southwest corner of West Forest Preserve Road and North Oak Park Avenue. The facility will include private
bedrooms and private bathrooms, 16 residential kitchens, a commercial kitchen, administrative, recreational, and support
spaces, outdoor space and parking for 181 vehicles. The completed building will be LEED Silver Certified.
To prevent freezing of plumbing and hydronic lines, and to continue working throughout the building, a proceed order in
the amount of $97,176.24 was previously approved to provide temporary heating through December 2, 2019. However,
the project completion date has been moved to April 2020. This will require the temporary heating to be extended to
cover the 2019/2020 winter season (Dec 2, 2019 through March 1, 2020). This revised proceed order will include
equipment and labor to cover the above-mentioned season.
The change is for the General Contractor– IHC Construction Companies, LLC
Description of RFP Change: This proceed order will change the scope of work to address temporary heat for the
2019/2020 winter season. This will be classified as a phased-construction change.
Requested Action: We are requesting board approval of proceed order G-77R in the amount of $164,289.78. This
revised proceed order combines the previously approved $97,176.24 with an additional $67,113.54 for a total of
$164,289.78.

Request for Board Approval of Modification
to Professional Services Agreement

Project History: The Samuel H. Shapiro Developmental Center is a 1,007,704 square foot, 57-building facility established
in 1879. The original scope of work provided for removing and replacing approximately 8,000 feet of steam and condensate
pipe, fittings and other accessories within the steam pipe system. The work also includes removing and replacing sections
of concrete tunnel tops to facilitate the project and make the tunnel system structurally sound. The project includes funding
for the abatement of asbestos-containing materials.
A previous project, completed in 2004, replaced approximately half of the steam and condensate lines. The remaining steam
and condensate lines have reached beyond their life expectancy and have developed leaks due to rusting and pitting. The
operational costs have jumped substantially, trying to make up for the leaks in energy and other costs associated with the
leaks. The overall piping system delivers steam to each of the 38 facility buildings and returns condensate back to a centrally
located power house. Steam supply and condensate breakages have a serious and negative impact on the facility's ability
to maintain vital services for the residents of Shapiro. The leakages increase the costs of water, sewer, gas, electricity and
chemicals for the boilers. Also, the ability of Shapiro to maintain compliance with Public Health, CMS, and JAACHO
standards, in accordance with Federal Regulations, is compromised. The completion of this project will result in energy
efficiency at the Center.
The steam and condensate lines are located in a system of tunnels. These extend both under institutional roadways and as
sidewalks. Many of these tunnel tops require replacement because they have deteriorated and are structurally unsound.
They have failed and leave gaps at the surfaces. There have been cases where vehicles have fallen through the tops and
had to be towed. The open tops are also allowing vermin to enter the tunnel system.
PURPOSE OF THIS AGREEMENT MODIFICATION: Scope change to add the replacement of all steam/condensate
piping and all tunnel repairs that exceed the original project budget including:
1. Replacement of all steam/condensate piping and all tunnel repairs in the existing tunnel section from the "Cross" to
the Vocational Center.
2. Replacement of all steam/condensate piping and all tunnel repairs in the existing tunnel sections supplying Buildings
805 and 813.
3. Replacement of all steam piping currently in place from the Tooper Building to the 100-200 Complex.
Also, revise Project Schedule dates, with the exception of the Contract Completion Date.

Project History: The Prairie State Community College is an eleven-building facility established in 1951. The main
building is four stories high with a total area of 250,520 square feet. This is the primary academic and office building for
the college.
The scope of work for this project provides for the replacement of ten roof-mounted condenser units, and a new Building
Automation System (BAS) throughout. The new BAS system will replace the current pneumatic system with a new digital
system. The project is currently underway and will continue through the summer of 2020. The last major building-wide
HVAC system work was completed 25 years ago.
Description of RFP Change: The change is to retrofit 220 existing VAV (variable air volume) boxes with new butterfly
dampers, in lieu of the existing plunger style damper. The VAV boxes are 25 years old, and the damper is the moving part
that controls the air flow. Approval of this change order will allow the college to install dampers that more closely integrate
existing VAV boxes with the new BAS system. This will allow better performance of the HVAC system and extend the
lifespan of the VAV units. This will be classified as a user requested change.
Requested Action: We are requesting board approval of change order H-2 in the amount of $165,476.15.
