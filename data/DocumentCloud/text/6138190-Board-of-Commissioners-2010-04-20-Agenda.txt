ITEM #8 cont’d
WHEREAS, the IDOT study is being advanced as a federally mandated two-tiered process consisting of
Tier One, the development of a multimodal transportation concept for the study area, and Tier Two,
detailed engineering and environmental studies for elements of the preferred build alternative; and
WHEREAS, Tier One of the IDOT study is set to conclude with the FHWA Record of Decision stating
that the preferred multimodal transportation system selected based upon consideration of transportation
performance, environmental impacts, regulatory agency comments and stakeholder input and support; and
WHEREAS, through an extensive public outreach and stakeholder involvement program consistent with
IDOT's Context Sensitive Solution (CSS) policy, IDOT, and the regional stakeholders have reached
consensus that the preferred multimodal transportation system is Build Alternative 203 and Option D; and
WHEREAS, Tier Two of the IDOT study will include analysis of funding strategies, funding sources and
the availability of project funding including, but not limited to, Federal and State funding, tolling through
the Illinois State Toll Highway Authority (ISTHA), and potential public-private partnerships; and
WHEREAS, the impacted stakeholder communities would prefer that the proposed expressway facilities
be constructed as non-tolled freeways, but understand that this project may be completed with greater
expediency should the ISTHA be authorized to construct all or part of the preferred Build Alternative 203
and Option D; and
WHEREAS, the stakeholder communities recognize the impacts of a national recession on employment
in the area, they urge that IDOT, ISTHA, the Governor's Office and the FHWA all work to expedite this
project in order to significantly impact job creation and stimulate the economy; and

stakeholder communities would agree to building the project in stages in order to realize immediate
economic benefit, with the understanding and agreement that the entire project must be built as funding is
available; and
WHEREAS, the stakeholder communities further support the construction of these roadways because the
area designated for these infrastructure improvements is already urbanized and the construction of the
roadways will not create additional sprawl but rather mitigate congestion, improve air quality and
maximize opportunities within this region; and
WHEREAS, the stakeholder communities further request that the construction of the western access and
the western by-pass, Alternative 203 and Option D, be built with the greenest technologies available and
with the highest regard for environmental impact; and

ITEM #36 cont’d
2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
The account (211-449) was identified for this transfer of funds because of an unanticipated surplus
in this account. This account was expected to be used to fund the maintenance cost for the
Cashiering System upgrade. However, due to minor setbacks, the “go live” date of the system was
postponed until the fall of 2010, funds for maintenance will be less than anticipated for FY 2010.
Additionally, the Sheriff’s Office received a reimbursement for 2009 radio maintenance costs from
the Forest Preserve District of Cook County that was credited to the FY 2010 account.
The account (215-330) was identified due to unanticipated surplus funds. This surplus is due
primarily to a change in the specifications for toilet paper/paper towels. This contract is expected to
be awarded for nearly half the previous year’s cost.
The account (236-298) was identified due to unanticipated surplus funds. This surplus is the result
of a review of the contract for substance abuse treatment. This review conducted by the current
vendor, received in the third week of February 2010, revealed that there would be an unbilled
surplus in this contract of approximately $217,000.00 for FY 2010. This is primarily due to the fact
that the average length of stay for most day reporting unit participants is shorter than originally
projected.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from.
There is nothing that will be deferred, delayed, or cancelled as a result of the reduction in accounts
211-449, 215-330 or 236-298.

4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
Account (211-449) has a surplus because the maintenance cost of the cashiering system will be less
than anticipated for FY 2010 and a credit from the Forest Preserve District of Cook County for FY
2009 charges. Account (215-330) has a surplus due to the fact that the toilet paper/paper towel
contract for the Sheriff’s Custodial Department is expected to be awarded for significantly less than
the previous year’s cost. Account (236-298) has a surplus due to the fact that the fact that the
average length of stay for a day reporting unit participant is shorter than originally projected.
