Ordinance authorizing a contract for Microsoft license renewal

175 W. Jackson Blvd,

Chicago, IL 60604

The proposed ordinance authorizes the execution of a contract amendment with CDW
Government LLC (CDW-G) for Microsoft license renewals. The licenses are for software products
- Windows server and desktop operating systems, Exchange Server, Office 365, and SQL Server that are critical to RTA’s daily operations. The proposed amendment extends the contract term
from May 31, 2019 to September 30, 2019 and increases the total contract value by $250,000.00,
to $454,873.57. The amendment allows RTA to purchase the licenses that takes us through May
31, 2022.
Background
Ordinance No. 2016-22 authorized the RTA to purchase Microsoft licenses by piggybacking on
the statewide master contract between the State of Illinois and CDW-G. Staff proposes to
continue piggybacking on the state’s contract with CDW-G for renewing the licenses. This
approach allows the RTA to benefit from cost savings from the state’s selection of a Microsoftcertified Large Account Reseller. The state contract has an intergovernmental joint purchasing
agreement clause, covers the RTA’s required scope of services, and was competitively bid. The
amendment will allow the RTA to renew its existing Microsoft licenses through May 31, 2022.
CDW-G has previously submitted the RTA’s Vendor/Contractor Certification which: (i) discloses
the names of the principals and any contracted lobbyists, (ii) certifies that entering into this
contract will not create a prohibited conflict of interest, and (iii) certifies that the firms and its
principals have not been debarred or suspended from participating in public contracts and have
not been convicted of procurement-related offenses. CDW-G has also agreed to update the
Certification should any of the information change during the contract period.
Financial Impact
The proposed amendment extends the contract term from May 31, 2019 to September 30, 2019
and increases the total contract value by $250,000.00, to $454,873.57. The approved RTA 2019
budget contains sufficient funding to support the cost of this amendment. Any related
expenditures in subsequent years are subject to appropriation of funds by the RTA Board of
Directors.
