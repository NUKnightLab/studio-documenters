CALLING ON CONGRESS TO REPEAL THE DICKEY AMENDMENT
WHEREAS, on October 7, 1993, a study titled “Gun Ownership as a Risk Factor for Homicide in the
Home” sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and published in the New England Journal of
Medicine (Vol. 329 No. 15) concluded that rather than confer protection, guns kept in the home are
associated with an increase in the risk of homicide by a family member or intimate acquaintance, and that
residents in homes with a gun faced a 2.7-fold greater risk of homicide and a 4.8-fold greater risk of suicide;
15

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

June 29, 2016

and
WHEREAS, this peer-reviewed published study that analyzed 1860 homicides recorded in three (3) United
States Counties from August 23, 1987, and August 23, 1992, also concluded that although firearms are
often kept in homes for personal protection, the practice is counterproductive and that efforts to increase
home security have largely focused on preventing unwanted entry, but the greatest threat to the lives of
household members appears to come from within; and
WHEREAS, as a result of the publication of this study, the National Rifle Association (NRA) moved to
suppress the dissemination of the results and to block funding of future government research into the causes
of firearm injuries. Hence, in 1996, the NRA lobbied to include an amendment to an appropriations bill that
removed $2.6 million from the CDC’s budget, the amount the agency’s injury center had spent on
firearms-related research the previous year; and
WHEREAS, named after its author Jay Dickey, a Republican member of the United States House of
Representatives from Arkansas, the now known as the Dickey amendment, is a provision first inserted as a
rider into the 1996 federal government omnibus spending bill which mandated that “none of the funds made
available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) may
be used to advocate or promote gun control”; and
WHEREAS, the Dickey amendment has been part of the federal government spending bill ever since,
preventing U.S. scientists from answering a most basic question: “What works to prevent firearm injuries?”;
and
WHEREAS, on July 27, 2012, Jay Dickey, through a Washington Post Opinion, called to repeal the
amendment that bears his name, and to conduct scientific research into preventing firearm injuries and to
find ways to prevent firearm deaths without encroaching on the rights of legitimate gun owners; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Dickey also rationalizes that “the federal government has invested billions to understand
the causes of motor vehicle fatalities and, with that knowledge, has markedly reduced traffic deaths in the
United States. Since the mid-1970s, research has inspired such interventions as child restraints, seat belts,
frontal air bags, a minimum drinking age and motorcycle helmets. The National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration estimates that 366,000 lives were saved through such efforts from 1975 to 2009”; and
WHEREAS, in an editorial in the April 7, 2015 issue of Annals of Internal Medicine, a team of doctors
wrote: "It does not matter whether we believe that guns kill people or that people kill people with guns-the
result is the same: a public health crisis"; and
WHEREAS, in a Mother Jones article published in April, 2015, an analysis of data from 2012 conducted
in collaboration with Ted Miller from the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, an independent
nonprofit that studies public health, education, and safety issues, found that the annual cost of gun violence
in America exceeds $229 billion. Direct costs account for $8.6 billion-including long-term prison costs for
people who commit assault and homicide using guns, which at $5.2 billion a year is the largest direct
expense; and that the average cost to taxpayers for a single gun homicide in America is nearly $400,000.
Indirect costs amount to at least $221 billion, about $169 billion of which comes from what researchers
consider to be the impact on victims' quality of life. Victims' lost wages, which account for $49 billion
annually, are the other major factor; and
WHEREAS, on December 2, 2015, physicians with Doctors for America joined the National Physicians
Alliance, Doctors Council, American Medical Women’s Association, American College of Preventive
Medicine, The Committee of Interns and Residents, Physicians for the Prevention of Gun Violence,

ban on the ability for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Institutes of
Health (NIH) to conduct research on gun violence. Over 2,000 doctors in all 50 states plus the District of
Columbia signed a petition urging Congress to remove the barriers to common sense research that have
existed for nearly 20 years and include annual funding to identify causes and ways to prevent gun violence.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the members of the Cook County Board of
Commissioners do hereby urge the United States Congress and the United States Senate to repeal the Dickey
Amendment and fund scientific research into preventing firearm injuries and the prevention of firearm
deaths; and

of Chicago over 2,400 guns; and
WHEREAS, in 2016 to date the Cook County Sheriff has confiscated and removed from the streets of

WHEREAS, the recent massacre in an Orlando, Florida, as well as too many other similar incidents
throughout the United States of America, have shown the extraordinary damage and loss of life that can be
caused by semi-automatic assault weapons and high capacity magazines; and
WHEREAS, gun violence in Chicago and Cook County has reached a crisis point requiring swift and
meaningful legislative action; and
WHEREAS, military-style assault weapons have no place on the streets of the City of Chicago in Cook
County, as they have no purpose other than to kill; and
WHEREAS, it is right and proper that the Cook County Board of Commissioners should express the will
of the body on the issue of gun violence generally, and on assault weapons specifically, because of the
extraordinary cost of gun violence to the Health and Hospitals System, Jail and Circuit Court of Cook
County.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and Cook County Board of Commissioners
do hereby call upon the General Assembly of the State of Illinois to enact and the Governor of Illinois to

WHEREAS, on June 14, 2016, the American Medical Association publicly proclaimed Gun Violence to
be a “Public Health Crisis,” and implored the United States Congress to lift its ban on research of gun
violence by Centers for Disease Control (CDC); and

ESTABLISHING EMPLOYER PAID SICK LEAVE FOR RESIDENTS OF COOK COUNTY
WHEREAS, the County of Cook is a home rule unit of government pursuant to the 1970 Illinois
Constitution, Article VII, Section 6 (a); and
WHEREAS, pursuant to their home rule powers, the Cook County Commissioners may exercise any power
and perform any function relating to their governments and affairs, including the power to regulate for the
protection of the public health, safety, morals, and welfare; and
WHEREAS, promoting the public health and welfare for those who work within the County’s border
plainly meets this criterion; and
WHEREAS, employees in every industry occasionally require time away from the workplace to tend to
their own health or the health of family members; and
WHEREAS, in Cook County, XX percent of private sector workers received no paid sick leave; and
WHEREAS, paid sick leave has a positive effect of the health of not only employees and their family
members, but also the health of fellow workers and public at large and the most comprehensive national
survey of U.S. restaurant workers found that two-thirds of restaurant wait staff and cooks have come to
work sick; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Health and Hospitals System spends between 350 and 500 million in
uncompensated care and has an interest in the health of County residents; and
WHEREAS, paid sick leave reduces health care expenditures by promoting access to primary and
preventative care and reduces reliance on emergency care; and
WHEREAS, nationally providing all workers with paid sick leave would result in 1.1 billion in annual
savings in hospital emergency department costs; and

with the court can involve highly charged & emotional issues. The rooms are welcoming environments,
cheerfully decorated and child centered with age and developmentally appropriate activities. An array of
books, toys games, and movies allow the children to be children.
Each room will have a Parent Resource Center with brochures and pamphlets provided by social service
and other outreach agencies.

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

Summary: The Cook County Assessor’s Office and Cook County Clerk’s Office request authorization
for the Chief Procurement Officer to enter into and execute a contract with Cook County Suburban
Publishers, Inc.
This contract will satisfy the statutory requirements for the Cook County Clerk’s Office set forth in
Article 12 of the Election Code, 10 ILCS 5/12-1 et seq. which requires the Cook County Clerk’s Office
to place notices in a minimum of two newspapers for each suburban municipality in the election
jurisdiction on the same day and for the same duration of time. If multiple vendors are involved, there
could be a scenario where some newspapers in certain municipalities have different publication dates.
This would result in a loss of coordination of the notices and possible confusion among the voters.
Therefore, it is necessary to have one source that can publish notices in all election municipalities on the
same day. Cook County Suburban Publishers, Inc. can provide the necessary geographical coverage and
guarantee that notices are placed in the correct papers on the same day.
This contract will also satisfy the statutory requirements for the Cook County Assessor’s Office set forth
in 35 ILCS 200/12-20 and 715 ILCS 10/1 which require assessments to be published at the same time for
the North and South suburban townships. Cook County Suburban Publishers can publish the North and
South suburban townships under one umbrella.
This contract is awarded as a Sole Source procurement pursuant to Section 34-139 of the Cook County
Procurement Code.

Intergovernmental Agreement under Title IV-D of the Social security Act. The Budget Department has
received all requisite grant documents.
Goods or Services: Under the Agreement with IDHFS, Title IV-D cases involving poor, single parents
with children for parentage and/or child support are initially heard by administrative hearing officers. The
hearing officers’ function is to obtain the expedited agreement of the parties before them and avoid the
matter going to a judge for determination on issues of parentage and support. This streamlining of the
judicial process results in a more prompt and efficient resolution to parentage and child support disputes.
Agreement Number(s): 2017-55-028-K
Agreement Period: 7/1/2016 - 6/30/2017
Fiscal Impact: None
Accounts: NA
Summary: This intergovernmental Agreement funds the salaries and fringe benefits of eight (8)
administrative hearing officers and seven (7) support staff. Each administrative hearing officer is paired
with a courtroom to help never-married, poor, single parents with children reach agreement on matters
related to paternity and child support issues in Title IV-D cases. If no agreement results, parties are
entitled to a hearing before a judge. Approximately 22,000 cases per year are directed to the hearing
officers for resolution.
Funds available under this agreement represent approximately 60 percent of funds allocated in recent
previous agreements and are expected to last until February 2017. At that time, or upon expiration of the
Agreement at 6/30/2017, whichever occurs first, the Intergovernmental Agreement program will be
terminated.

Summary: The Circuit Court of Cook County will use this grant award from the Center for Court

(RJCC) program for young adults. The RJCC will be initially piloted in Chicago’s North Lawndale
community and will target young adults, ages 18-26, accused of committing low-level, nonviolent felony
and misdemeanor offenses. The court will follow Restorative Justice concepts which invest in the future
of nonviolent offenders, their victims, and the community. The RJCC will partner with various
community social service organizations to address the social, vocational and educational needs of the
offenders, repair the harm done to victims and the community, and help to reintegrate the offender back

(d) In furtherance of this commitment, and at the direction of the Board and the President of the Board,
supported by County staff , professionals, and consultants, conducted an investigation to determine whether
and to what degree (1) there continues to be into the scope of any discrimination in County Procurements,
and in the award of and participation in contracts in the metropolitan County Chicago economy; , the extent
to which (2) such discrimination or the effects thereof has denied and continues to deny small and
economically disadvantaged minority and women's business enterprises equal opportunity to participate in
such Procurements and contracts; (3) small businesses owned and managed by economically
disadvantaged minorities and women in the County Marketplace experience disparate negative impacts in
terms of participating in public and private transactions, including but not limited to transactions with the
County, those private enterprises with whom it does business, and other private enterprises; (4) small,
economically disadvantaged businesses owned and managed by minorities and women in the County
Marketplace experience reduced earnings; (5) the formation of businesses owned and managed by
minorities and women in the County Marketplace is disproportionately low; (6) there continues to be a
chronic lack of wealth, business loans, and financial liquidity among the County’s minority communities
and among minorities who own and operate their own small businesses; (7) the disproportionate levels of
poverty among minorities in the County and any of the foregoing elements detrimentally affect the County’s
efforts to protect and promote public safety, health and welfare, and to identify the appropriate affirmative
action steps to be taken to eliminate any such discrimination, obstacles, and poverty and its their continuing
effects.
(e) Minority and women small businesses continue to be awarded prime contracts and subcontracts in dollar
amounts that are disproportionately lower than the availability of such businesses willing and able to
perform Contracts.
(f) The County's procurement practices in the past have contributed to the above identified underutilization
of Minorityminority, and women small businesses on contracts and subcontractsContracts.
(g) Minority and women's, small businesses continue to be disadvantaged by discriminatory practices in
the local construction industry and economy when competing for contracts Contracts and in seeking
subcontracting opportunities on such contractsContracts.
(h) The County was a passive participant in the discriminatory practices of businesses which discriminate
against minority, women businesses by entering into contracts with such discriminating businesses.
(i) Despite the County’s its good faith efforts and implementation of previous affirmative action programs,
minority and women small businesses remain at a competitive disadvantage in competing for Ccontracts
and subcontracts.
(j) Race and gender neutral measures or affirmative action programs without numerical goals have not and
are not likely to eliminate the competitive disadvantage of minority and women small businesses in
participating in Ccontracts due to discrimination in the local economy.
(k) The numerical goals for the participation of minority and women's businesses in Contracts are
commensurate with the availability of minority and women's businesses willing and able to perform County
work.

In the case of a Procurement of supplies, equipment, or goods, placing an order for delivery
directly to the Using Agency is not a Commercially Useful Function; provided, however,
that to the extent such practice is consistent with normal industry practices, a PCE
subcontractor may enter into second tier subcontracts. However, if a PCE Contractor or
subcontractor subcontracts a significantly greater portion of the work of the Contract than
would be expected on the basis of normal industry practices, the PCE shall be presumed
not to be performing a Commercially Useful Function.

(2)

In the case of a Procurement of services, a Person which subcontracts with another Person
to perform the services required does not perform a Commercially Useful Function unless
such Person also performs significant supervisory or management responsibilities. In the
case of a Joint Venture partner, each Joint Venture partner must perform a Commercially
Useful Function.

(3)

A PCE does not perform a Commercially Useful Function if its role is limited to that of an
extra participant in the Contract through which funds are passed in order to obtain the
appearance of PCE participation.

(4)

When a PCE is presumed not to be performing a Commercially Useful Function, the
Certified PCE and the Person seeking to include that PCE in its Utilization Plan, may
present evidence to rebut this presumption.

below. The same PCE, whether as a contractor, subcontractor or supplier, may not cannot be utilized
duplicatively as both an MBE and a WBE on the same Contract.
(1)

PCE as prime Contractor. An MBE or WBE may count its own participation toward the
achievement of the applicable MBE or WBE goal. Such PCE will be required to meet the
other goals by another method described herein. If a PCE is certified as a WBE and is also
a MBE, such PCE’s WBE's participation may count toward either the MBE or WBE
Goalbut not both.

(2)

Joint Venture with one or more PCE. Where a Person engages in a Joint Venture with one
or more PCEs, the Utilization Plan shall include a written agreement containing at least the

a.

Each Joint Venture partner's initial capital investment;

b.

The extent to which the each PCE's’ proposed participation in the performance of
the Contract constitutes a Commercially Useful Function;

c.

Whether the relevant PCE's shares in the risks and profits of the Joint Venture is
proportional to their ownership interest;

d.

Whether the relevant PCE will have duties, responsibilities, management Control
and risk with respect to the Joint Venture in proportion to its ownership interest;

Subcontracting. A Person may achieve the Contract Specific Goals by means of
subcontracting with, or purchasing from one or more PCEs.

Sec. 34-271. - Request for a total or partial waiver; good faith efforts.
(a) Parties submitting bids or proposals for Procurements may in all instances request a partial or full
waiver of one or more established contract-specific Goal for PCE participation. In reviewing a request for
a partial or total request for waiver of a Contract Specific Goal, the CCD shall determine whether a Person
has made good faith efforts to meet the applicable Goals and to what extent the waiver request should be
granted. In determining whether a Person has made Good faith efforts, the CCD will consider whether the
Person has taken the following actions:
(1)

Reviewed lists of PCEs maintained by the County and other State and local governments
and agencies to identify qualified PCEs for solicitation for Bids;

(2)

Divided Procurement requirements into small tasks or quantities. This shall include, where
appropriate, breaking out Contract work items into economically feasible units, consistent
with the availability of PCEs, to facilitate PCE participation, even when the Contractor
would otherwise prefer to perform these work items with its own forces;

(3)

Adjusted any insurance requirements imposed by the Person seeking PCEs, or otherwise
assist PCEs in obtaining any required insurance, where economically feasible, to encourage
participation by PCEs;

(4)

Make Made timely attempts to contact PCEs providing the type of supplies, equipment,
goods or services required for the Procurement; and provide them with a convenient and
timely opportunity to obtain and review all information concerning the Procurement
necessary to enable such PCE to respond;

(5)

Followed up initial contacts of PCEs to determine if they are interested participating in the
Procurement;

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

June 29, 2016

(6)

Negotiated in good faith and on a timely basis with PCEs to enable them to participate in
the Procurement. Evidence of such negotiation includes the names, addresses, and
telephone numbers of PCEs that were contacted; a description of the information provided
regarding the plans and specifications for the work selected for subcontracting; and why
agreements could not be reached. The Contractor may not reject PCEs as being unqualified
without sound reasons. That there may be some additional costs involved in finding and
using PCEs is not in itself sufficient reason for a Contractor's failure to meet the Goals, as
long as such costs are reasonable;

(7)

Make Made efforts to assist interested PCEs in obtaining necessary equipment, supplies,
materials, or related assistance or services, where appropriate; provided, however, that such
efforts shall not be inconsistent with the requirement that the PCE be responsible for
actually obtaining and paying for such items;

(8)

Established delivery schedules which will encourage participation by PCEs, where the
requirements of the Procurement permit;

(9)

Used the services and assistance of the CCD's staff, the Small Business Administration,

more PCEs that is enforceable and that, in the judgment of the CCD, has performance
standards and outcomes that are clearly established and effective in terms of assisting the
PCE in acquiring additional skills, experience, and relationships helpful to the long-term

the CCD that no PCE exists with which a mentor/protege relationship could be established,
as described in Section 34-271.

(b) In determining whether a Bidder or Respondent has made Good Faith Efforts, the levels of participation
by PCEs set forth in Utilization Plans submitted by other Persons for the same Procurement may be
considered. For example, if the apparent successful Bidder or Respondent fails to meet the Contract Specific
Goals, but meets or exceeds the average PCE participation obtained by other Bidders or Respondents, this
may be evidence that the apparent successful Bidder or Respondent made Good Faith Efforts.
(c) Where the County requires professional services, the County must be able to call upon those
professionals whose particular training and experience are most beneficial to the County.
(1)

A Utilization Plan shall be required, and if a waiver or partial waiver is requested, "good

(d) Mentor/protégé agreements. Where a Contractor enters into or maintains a mentor/protege agreement
with a PCE to improve or develop certain aspects of the business of the PCE, the CCD shall evaluate the

Receiving and considering written reports, adopts the following findings as a strong basis
in evidence supporting a narrowly tailored, remedial affirmative action program in Public
Works Contracts;

(d) The County seeks to provide a level playing field and equal access for all prime contractors and
subcontractors to participate in Public Works Contracts;
(e) The County continues to be committed to implementing an affirmative action program associated with
local small businesses owned by economically disadvantaged minorities and women in conformance with
the United States Supreme Court's decision in City of Richmond v. Croson and other relevant law.
(f) In furtherance of this commitment, the Board and the President of the Board, supported by County staff
, professionals, and consultants, conducted an investigation to determine whether and to what degree (1)
there continues to be discrimination in County Procurements, and in the award of and participation in
contracts in the metropolitan County economy; (2) such discrimination or the effects thereof has denied and
continues to deny small and economically disadvantaged minority and women's business enterprises equal
opportunity to participate in such Procurements and contracts; (3) small businesses owned and managed
by economically disadvantaged minorities and women in the County Marketplace experience disparate
negative impacts in terms of participating in public and private transactions, including but not limited to
transactions with the County, those private enterprises with whom it does business, and other private
enterprises; (4) small, economically disadvantaged businesses owned and managed by minorities and
women in the County Marketplace experience reduced earnings; (5) the formation of businesses owned and
managed by minorities and women in the County Marketplace is disproportionately low; (6) there continues
to be a chronic lack of wealth, business loans, and financial liquidity among the County’s minority
communities and among minorities who own and operate their own small businesses; (7) the
disproportionate levels of poverty among minorities in the County and any of the foregoing elements
detrimentally affect the County’s efforts to protect and promote public safety, health and welfare, and to
identify the appropriate affirmative action steps to be taken to eliminate any such discrimination, obstacles,
and poverty and their continuing effects.
(eg) The County has engaged in committee hearings collected and analyzed data, conducted interviews
with stakeholders, and otherwise conducted a study of its Program to determine whether and to what degree
disparities exist relative to the participation of minority and woman-owned businesses in County and nonCounty contracts “Cook County, Illinois Disparity Study 2015" (the "NERA Disparity Study") on the
levels of PCE participation in Public Works Contracts, and has considered the evidence in relevant case
law; and
(fh) The NERA Disparity Study entails made recommendations for an revised improved Minority- and
Women-owned business program for construction contracting, emphasizing the establishment of Projectspecific goals, implementation of race- and gender-neutral measures, and enhancements to data gathering,
implementation and performance monitoring of the program;
(gi) The County has a compelling interest in preventing discrimination and desires to reaffirm its
commitment to full and fair opportunities for all firms to participate in its construction contracts.

Sec. 34-295. - Project specific goals.
The CCD, following the compilation and stringent review of the most current data that is feasibly and
practicably available relative to the availability of MBEs and WBEs who have the capacity to successfully
supply the relevant goods and services, and in consultation with the User Department Agency, shall
establish Project Specific Goals for construction, which shall be incorporated into each bid and RFP.
Contracts based upon the availability of at least three MBEs and three WBEs to perform the anticipated
subcontracting functions of the project and the County's utilization of MBEs and WBEs to date.
Sec. 34-296. - Counting MBE and WBE participation.
***
(h) If a PCE ceases to be cCertified Firm for any other reason than graduation from the M/WBE
Construction Program during its performance on a contract, the dollar value of work performed under a
contract with that firm after it has ceased to be certified shall not be counted for the remaining term of the
Contract.
(i) In determining achievement of Project Specific Goals, the participation of an MBE or WBE shall not
be counted until that amount has been paid to the MBE or WBE.
Sec. 34-297. - Contract pre-award compliance procedures.
(a) For all solicitations, the bidder/proposer shall submit a Utilization Plan detailing all subcontractors from
which the Contractor solicited bids or quotations, and if Project Specific Goals have been established, its
achievement of the Goals or its Good Faith Efforts to do so. The Utilization Plan shall be due at the time
the bid/proposal is due. In the event a bid or proposal leads to a Contract with the County, the Utilization
Plan as approved by the CCD shall be incorporated as a material commitment on the part of the Contractor
to each relevant PCE, and the contractor and the County. Failure to include a Utilization Plan shall render
the bid or proposal not Responsive.
(b) Any agreement between a Contractor and an MBE or WBE in which the Contractor requires that the

(c) Where the Contractor cannot achieve the Project Specific Goal(s), the CCD will determine whether the
Contractor has made Good Faith Efforts to meet the Goal(s). Parties submitting bids or proposals for
Procurements may in all instances request a partial or full waiver of one or more established Project Specific
Goal for PCE participation. In making this determination, the Director will consider, at a minimum,
whether the Contractor's efforts to has:
(1)

Solicited through all reasonable and available means (e.g., attendance at pre-bid meetings,
advertising and written notices) the interest of all MBEs and WBEs certified in the scopes
of work of the contract. The Contractor shall provide interested MBEs and WBEs with
timely, adequate information about the plans, specifications, and requirements of the
contract to allow MBEs and WBEs to respond to the solicitation. The Contractor must
follow up initial solicitations with interested MBEs and WBEs.

(2)

Selected portions of the work to be performed by MBEs and WBEs in order to increase the
likelihood that the Project Specific Goals will be achieved. This includes, where
appropriate, breaking out contract work items into economically feasible units to facilitate
MBE and WBE participation, even when the Contractor would otherwise prefer to perform
these work items with its own forces. It is the Contractor's responsibility to make a portion
of the work available to MBEs and WBEs and to select those portions of the work or
material needs consistent with the availability of MBEs and WBEs to facilitate their
participation.

(3)

Negotiated in good faith with interested MBEs and WBEs. Evidence of such negotiation
includes the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of MBEs and WBEs that were
contacted; a description of the information provided regarding the plans and specifications
for the work selected for subcontracting; and why agreements could not be reached with
MBEs and WBEs. The Contractor may not reject MBEs and WBEs as being unqualified
without sound reasons based on a thorough investigation of their capabilities. That there
may be some additional costs involved in finding and using MBEs and WBEs is not in
itself sufficient reason for a Contractor's failure to meet the Project Specific Goals, as long
as such costs are reasonable. The ability or desire of a Contractor to perform the work of a
contract with its own organization does not relieve it of the responsibility to make Good
Faith Efforts on all scopes of work that could be subcontracted.

(4)

Makde efforts to assist interested MBEs and WBEs in obtaining bonding, lines of credit,
or insurance as required by the County or the prime Contractor, where appropriate.

(5)

Makde efforts to assist interested MBEs and WBEs in obtaining necessary equipment,
supplies, materials, or related assistance or services, where appropriate.

(6)

Used the services of the Office of Contract Compliance, available minority/women
community organizations, minority/women contractors' groups, government-sponsored
minority/women business assistance offices and other appropriate organizations to provide
assistance in the recruitment and placement of MBEs and WBEs.

(7)

Maintains or commits to establish and maintain a mentor-protégé agreement with one or
more PCEs that is enforceable and that, in the judgement of the CCD, has performance
standards and outcomes that are clearly established and effective in terms of assisting the
PCE in acquiring additional skills, experience, and relationships helpful to the long-term
success of the PCE consistent with the provisions of Section 34-271(d).
***

(g) If the CCD determines that the Utilization Plan demonstrates that the Project Specific Goals
have been achieved or Good Faith Efforts made, with the concurrence of the User Department Agency, the
CCD and User Department Agency shall recommend award to Purchasing Agent.

records by any officer or official of the County for any purpose.

Contractor to contract penalties or other sanctions. Upon such written approval by the CCD, the revised
Utilization Plan shall be incorporated into the Contract as an amendment by the CPO. The CCD shall
promulgate policies and procedures with respect to changes to a Utilization Plan.
(1)

the Utilization Plan shall be made to the CCD, Purchasing Agent CPO and the User
Department Agency in writing, and shall clearly and fully set forth the basis for the request.

designated for an MBE or WBE subcontractor with its own forces unless and until the
CCD, in consultation with the CPO Purchasing Agent in consultation with and the User

Procurement Code, Division 8 Minority and Women-Owned Business Enterprises, various sections within
Subdivisions I and II of the Cook County Code are hereby amended as follows:
DIVISION 8. - MINORITY- AND WOMAN-OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISES
Subdivision I. - General Provisions
Sec. 34-260. - Short title.
This Subdivision shall be known and may be cited as the Cook County Minority- and Women-Owned
Business Enterprise General Ordinance. This Subdivision is applicable to all Contracts, except Public
Works Contracts which are governed by Subdivision II of this Division 8.
Sec. 34-261. - Preface and Findings.
(a) The County has heretofore adopted a Minority and Woman-Owned Business Enterprise Ordinance to
ensure that small businesses owned by economically disadvantaged minorities y and women's businesses
are provided full and equal opportunity to participate in Contracts.
(b) The Supreme Court of the United States in City of Richmond v. Croson, 488 U.S. 469 (1989), has
enunciated certain standards which are necessary to maintain effective affirmative action programs in
compliance with constitutional requirements.
(c) The County continues to be is committed to implementing an affirmative action program associated
with small businesses owned by economically disadvantaged minorities and women in conformance with
the United States Supreme Court's decision in City of Richmond v. Croson and other relevant law.
(d) In furtherance of this commitment, the Board and the President of the Board, supported by County staff
, professionals, and consultants, conducted an investigation to determine whether and to what degree (1)
there continues to be discrimination in County Procurements and in the award of and participation in
contracts in the metropolitan County economy; (2) such discrimination or the effects thereof has denied and
continues to deny small and economically disadvantaged minority and women's business enterprises equal
opportunity to participate in such Procurements and contracts; (3) small businesses owned and managed
by economically disadvantaged minorities and women in the County Marketplace experience disparate
negative impacts in terms of participating in public and private transactions, including but not limited to
Page 156 of 313

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

June 29, 2016

transactions with the County, those private enterprises with whom it does business, and other private
enterprises; (4) small, economically disadvantaged businesses owned and managed by minorities and
women in the County Marketplace experience reduced earnings; (5) the formation of businesses owned and
managed by minorities and women in the County Marketplace is disproportionately low; (6) there continues
to be a chronic lack of wealth, business loans, and financial liquidity among the County’s minority
communities and among minorities who own and operate their own small businesses; (7) the
disproportionate levels of poverty among minorities in the County and any of the foregoing elements
detrimentally affect the County’s efforts to protect and promote public safety, health and welfare, and to
identify the appropriate affirmative action steps to be taken to eliminate any such discrimination, obstacles,
and poverty and their continuing effects.
(e) Minority and women small businesses continue to be awarded prime contracts and subcontracts in dollar
amounts that are disproportionately lower than the availability of such businesses willing and able to
perform Contracts.
(f) The County's procurement practices in the past have contributed to the above identified underutilization
of minority, and women small businesses on contracts and subcontracts.
(g) Minority and women's, small businesses continue to be disadvantaged by discriminatory practices in
the local construction industry and economy when competing for contracts and in seeking subcontracting
opportunities on such contracts.
(h) The County was a passive participant in the discriminatory practices of businesses which discriminate
against minority, women businesses by entering into contracts with such discriminating businesses.
(i) Despite the County’s its good faith efforts and implementation of previous affirmative action programs,
minority and women small businesses remain at a competitive disadvantage in competing for contracts and
subcontracts.
(j) Race and gender neutral measures or affirmative action programs without numerical goals have not and
are not likely to eliminate the competitive disadvantage of minority and women small businesses in
participating in contracts due to discrimination in the local economy.
(k) The numerical goals for the participation of minority and women's businesses in Contracts are
commensurate with the availability of minority and women's businesses willing and able to perform County
work.
(l) The reduction of such discrimination in the local economy will help reduce the disproportionate levels
of poverty among minorities in the County and positively affect the County’s efforts to protect and promote
public safety, health, and welfare.
Sec. 34-262. - Policy and purpose.

decertification for the willful submission of false or inaccurate material information, the
failure to submit complete and accurate material information to the CCD regarding
certification, or a Procurement on a timely basis, and shall relate individually and jointly
to both PCEs and PCE owners.

(4)

the availability of PCEs to provide the supplies, materials and equipment or services
required by the Contract.
***

(b) The CCD, following the compilation and stringent review of the most current data that is feasibly and
practicably available relative to the availability of MBEs and WBEs who have the capacity to successfully
supply the relevant goods and services, and in consultation with the CPO and the Using Agency, shall
establish Contract Specific Goals for each Contract, which shall be incorporated into each bid and request
for proposal.
(c) No goal shall be treated as a quota nor shall it be used to discriminate against any Person on the
basis of race, color, national origin, religion or sex.
Sec. 34-268. - Certification criteria and process.
(a) Only Persons that meet the criteria for certification as a PCE may participate in the Program. The

(b) The Person must be either an individual who is Socially and Economically Disadvantaged or 51 percent
Owned by one or more individuals who are Socially and Economically Disadvantaged.
(1)

The Ownership by a Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Person must be real,
substantial, and continuing, going beyond pro forma ownership of the Person as reflected
in Ownership documents. The owner(s) must enjoy the customary incidents of ownership
and share in the risks and profits commensurate with that ownership interest.

(2)

The contributions to acquire the Ownership interest must be real and substantial, direct,
and in accord with generally accepted industry standards. If expertise is part of the
contribution, the Expertise must be of the requisite quality generally recognized in a
specialized field, necessary to the Person's potential success, specific to the type of work
the Person performs and documented in the Person's records.
***

(f) The County shall certify the eligibility of Joint Ventures involving PCEs and non-Certified Firms,
provided that the Joint Venture meets the criteria for certification as PCE. To be considered an eligible Joint
Venture, at least one partner of the Joint Venture must be a Certified Firm, with a share in the capital
contribution, control, management, risks, and profits of the Joint Venture which is equal to its ownership
interest. Each Certified Firm partner must contribute property, capital, efforts, skill and knowledge and be
responsible for a distinct, clearly defined portion of the work of the contract. Joint Ventures must have an
agreement in writing specifying the terms and conditions of the relationships between the partners and their
relationship and responsibility to the contract.
(g) In lieu of conducting its own certifications, the CCD by rule may accept formal certifications by other
entities, provided that Cook County's requirements are met.
(h) The certification status of all PCEs shall be reviewed periodically by the Office of Contract Compliance.
Failure of the Person to seek recertification by filing the necessary documentation with the CCD as provided

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

June 29, 2016

(i) It is the responsibility of the Certified PCE to notify the CCD of any change in its circumstances
affecting its continued eligibility for the Program. Failure to do so may result in the PCE's decertification.
(j) The CCD shall decertify a PCE that does not continuously meet the eligibility criteria.
(k) Disqualification pursuant to Division 4 of the Procurement Code shall create a prima facie case for
decertification by the County. The challenged PCE shall have the burden of proving that its County
certification should be maintained.
(l) Decertification by another agency shall create a prima facie case for decertification by the County. The
challenged PCE shall have the burden of proving that its County certification should be maintained.
(m) PCEs shall submit to the CCD complete and accurate material information, and shall not submit to the
CCD false, deceptive, fraudulent, or inaccurate material information, relative to (1) its status as a PCE; (2)
certification or recertification; (3) proposed or actual contract participation; and (4) any other matter that
arises during an investigation by the CCD or another County official, and shall be subject to the penalties
set forth in Section 34-175 and 34-275 for a violation of this subsection.
(n) A Person that has been denied certification or recertification or has been decertified may protest the
denial or decertification by submitting a petition for review in a proceeding made pursuant to Part I, Chapter
2, Article IX, Administrative Hearings, and the Administrative Rules promulgated thereunder.
(o) A Person found to be ineligible for certification or continuing certification for reasons other than those

decision.
(p) A third party may challenge the eligibility of an applicant for Certification or a Certified PCE pursuant
to procedures established by the CCD. Such challenges shall be signed and sworn by the individual
challenging the eligibility of an applicant for Certification or a Certified PCE. The burden of proof shall
rest with the complainant. Such challenges to eligibility shall be subject to an appeal. The CCD shall be the
final arbiter of all challenges. The presumption that the challenged PCE is eligible shall remain in effect
until the CCD renders a final decision.
Sec. 34-269. - Utilization plan; commercially useful function.
(a) Utilization Plan. The CPO shall include in Contract Documents for Contracts covered by this Division
a requirement that a Utilization Plan be submitted which either: (i) commits to PCE participation equal to
or greater than the applicable Contract Specific Goal or Goals, or (ii) requests a waiver of all or a portion
of a Contract Specific Goal.
(1)

The Utilization Plan shall be in such form and contain such information as is required by
the CCD, and may include such components as direct PCE participation, indirect PCE
participation, and a mentoring relationship with one or more PCEs.

(2)

The Utilization Plan shall be due at the time the bid or /proposal is due. In the event a bid
or proposal leads to a Contract with the County, the Utilization Plan as approved by the
Page 164 of 313

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

June 29, 2016

CCD shall be incorporated as a material commitment on the part of the Contractor to each
relevant PCE and the contractor and the County. Failure to include a Utilization Plan shall
render the bid or proposal not Responsive.
(3)

The CCD shall review and either approve or reject the Utilization Plan. For purposes of
evaluating a Utilization Plan, only PCEs which perform a Commercially Useful Function
relative to the supplies, equipment, goods, services, or types of work for which the PCE
has been certified shall be considered.

(4)

Once a Utilization Plan has been approved, the Contractor may not changes the Utilization
Plan, including substituting PCEs named in the Utilization Plan, without the prior written
approval of the CCD, in consultation with the CPO and the Using Agency. Upon such
written approval by the CCD, the revised Utilization Plan shall be incorporated into the
Contract as an amendment by the CPO. The CCD shall promulgate policies and
procedures with respect to changes to a Utilization Plan.

(b) Commercially Useful Function. To be considered in meeting Goals, a PCE must perform a
Commercially Useful Function.
(1)

In the case of a Procurement of supplies, equipment, or goods, placing an order for delivery
directly to the Using Agency is not a Commercially Useful Function; provided, however,
that to the extent such practice is consistent with normal industry practices, a PCE
subcontractor may enter into second tier subcontracts. However, if a PCE Contractor or
subcontractor subcontracts a significantly greater portion of the work of the Contract than
would be expected on the basis of normal industry practices, the PCE shall be presumed
not to be performing a Commercially Useful Function.

(2)

In the case of a Procurement of services, a Person which subcontracts with another Person
to perform the services required does not perform a Commercially Useful Function unless
such Person also performs significant supervisory or management responsibilities. In the
case of a Joint Venture partner, each Joint Venture partner must perform a Commercially
Useful Function.

(3)

A PCE does not perform a Commercially Useful Function if its role is limited to that of an
extra participant in the Contract through which funds are passed in order to obtain the
appearance of PCE participation.

(4)

When a PCE is presumed not to be performing a Commercially Useful Function, the
Certified PCE and the Person seeking to include that PCE in its Utilization Plan, may
present evidence to rebut this presumption.

Sec. 34-270. - Methods to achieve goals and compliance.
A Person may achieve the applicable Contract Specific Goals in any one or more of the methods set forth
below. The same PCE, whether as a contractor, subcontractor or supplier, may not be utilized duplicatively
as an MBE and a WBE on the same Contract.
Page 165 of 313

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

June 29, 2016

(1)

PCE as prime Contractor. An MBE or WBE may count its own participation toward the
achievement of the applicable MBE or WBE goal. Such PCE will be required to meet the
other goals by another method described herein. If a PCE is certified as a WBE and is also
a MBE, such PCE’s participation may count toward the MBE or WBE Goal.

(2)

Joint Venture with one or more PCE. Where a Person engages in a Joint Venture with one
or more PCEs, the Utilization Plan shall include a written agreement containing at least the
information set forth in this Subsection. The CCD shall consider the following in
determining whether the proposed Utilization Plan satisfies the Program Goals based upon
such written Joint Venture agreement and the Utilization Plan.

(3)

a.

Each Joint Venture partner's initial capital investment;

b.

The extent to which the each PCE's’ proposed participation in the performance of
the Contract constitutes a Commercially Useful Function;

c.

Whether the relevant PCE's shares in the risks and profits of the Joint Venture is
proportional to their ownership interest;

d.

Whether the relevant PCE will have duties, responsibilities, management Control
and risk with respect to the Joint Venture in proportion to its ownership interest;

Subcontracting. A Person may achieve the Contract Specific Goals by means of
subcontracting with, or purchasing from one or more PCEs.

Sec. 34-271. - Request for a total or partial waiver; good faith efforts.
(a) Parties submitting bids or proposals for Procurements may in all instances request a partial or full
waiver of one or more established contract-specific Goal for PCE participation. In reviewing a request for
a partial or total waiver of a Contract Specific Goal, the CCD shall determine whether a Person has made
good faith efforts to meet the applicable Goals and to what extent the waiver request should be granted. In
determining whether a Person has made Good faith efforts, the CCD will consider whether the Person has:
(1)

Reviewed lists of PCEs maintained by the County and other State and local governments
and agencies to identify qualified PCEs for solicitation for Bids;

(2)

Divided Procurement requirements into small tasks or quantities. This shall include, where
appropriate, breaking out Contract work items into economically feasible units, consistent
with the availability of PCEs, to facilitate PCE participation, even when the Contractor
would otherwise prefer to perform these work items with its own forces;

(3)

Adjusted any insurance requirements imposed by the Person seeking PCEs, or otherwise
assist PCEs in obtaining any required insurance, where economically feasible, to encourage
participation by PCEs;

Page 166 of 313

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

June 29, 2016

(4)

Made timely attempts to contact PCEs providing the type of supplies, equipment, goods or
services required for the Procurement; and provide them with a convenient and timely
opportunity to obtain and review all information concerning the Procurement necessary to
enable such PCE to respond;

(5)

Followed up initial contacts of PCEs to determine if they are interested participating in the
Procurement;

(6)

Negotiated in good faith and on a timely basis with PCEs to enable them to participate in
the Procurement. Evidence of such negotiation includes the names, addresses, and
telephone numbers of PCEs that were contacted; a description of the information provided
regarding the plans and specifications for the work selected for subcontracting; and why
agreements could not be reached. The Contractor may not reject PCEs as being unqualified
without sound reasons. That there may be some additional costs involved in finding and
using PCEs is not in itself sufficient reason for a Contractor's failure to meet the Goals, as
long as such costs are reasonable;

(7)

Made efforts to assist interested PCEs in obtaining necessary equipment, supplies,
materials, or related assistance or services, where appropriate; provided, however, that such
efforts shall not be inconsistent with the requirement that the PCE be responsible for
actually obtaining and paying for such items;

(8)

Established delivery schedules which will encourage participation by PCEs, where the
requirements of the Procurement permit;

(9)

Used the services and assistance of the CCD's staff, the Small Business Administration,
the Office of Minority Business Enterprises of the U.S. Department of Commerce;

(10)

Timely notified appropriate community and minority and women's business organizations
identified as assist agencies of the opportunity for participation in the Procurement;

(11)

Maintains or commits to establish and maintain a mentor-protégé agreement with one or
more PCEs that is enforceable and that, in the judgment of the CCD, has performance
standards and outcomes that are clearly established and effective in terms of assisting the
PCE in acquiring additional skills, experience, and relationships helpful to the long-term
success of the PCE, consistent with the provisions of Section 34-271(d).

(b) In determining whether a Bidder or Respondent has made Good Faith Efforts, the levels of participation
by PCEs set forth in Utilization Plans submitted by other Persons for the same Procurement may be
considered. For example, if the apparent successful Bidder or Respondent fails to meet the Contract Specific
Goals, but meets or exceeds the average PCE participation obtained by other Bidders or Respondents, this
may be evidence that the apparent successful Bidder or Respondent made Good Faith Efforts.
(c) Where the County requires professional services, the County must be able to call upon those
professionals whose particular training and experience are most beneficial to the County.

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

June 29, 2016

(1)

A Utilization Plan shall be required, and if a waiver or partial waiver is requested, "good
faith" efforts shall be demonstrated as set forth in Section 34-271; provided, however, that
such Persons shall not be required to attempt to subcontract with PCEs if subcontractors
would not typically be utilized for the type of Procurement. In such cases, the Person shall
document the reasons for not subcontracting in a waiver request.

(2)

The Contractor will endeavor to maximize use of PCEs for supplies, equipment, goods or
services for such Contractor's business operations not specifically for the Procurement.

(3)

If such Person is required to have or has an affirmative action plan and goals, such plan
and goals shall be submitted with their Utilization Plan. The CCD shall compare such plan
and goals with the Person's actual affirmative action achievements and such achievements
may be considered by the County in future Procurements.

(d) Mentor/protégé agreements. Where a Contractor enters into or maintains a mentor/protege agreement
with a PCE to improve or develop certain aspects of the business of the PCE, the CCD shall evaluate the
effect of such agreement as a factor in determining good faith efforts. The mentor/protégé agreement may
provide for the Contractor to assist the PCE in such areas as technical aspects of the PCE's business,
improving financial management, or providing on-the-job training. To constitute good faith efforts, the
mentor/protégé agreement shall satisfy the following requirements.
(1)

The PCE performs a Commercially Useful Function;

(2)

The agreement shall be included in the Utilization Plan; and

(3)

The agreement clearly defines the respective responsibilities of the Contractor and the PCE
and includes specific, measurable goals to be attained by both parties through the
performance of the agreement. In order to be a factor in establishing best efforts, the
mentor/protégé agreement must be for a reasonable period of time.

(e) The CCD may grant a total or partial waiver based upon the following criteria:
(1)

There are not sufficient PCEs capable of providing the supplies, equipment, goods or
services required for the Procurement;

(2)

The Procurement cannot reasonably be divided;

(3)

The price required by potential PCEs is more than ten percent above competitive levels;
and

(4)

Any other factor relating to good faith efforts as set forth in the Person's Utilization Plan.

(g) If a PCE ceases to be a certified for any other reason than graduation from the M/WBE Program during
its performance on a contract, the dollar value of work performed under a contract with that firm after it
has ceased to be certified shall not be counted for the remaining term of the Contract.
(h) Only the dollar amount actually paid to the PCE shall be counted toward the participation of a PCE.
Sec. 34-273. - Review of contract performance.
(a) Compliance with Utilization Plan. The CCD shall review the Contractor and PCE's compliance with
its Utilization Plan as necessary during the performance of the Contract. The CCD may establish such
requirements for periodic Contractor and PCE reporting on compliance with its Utilization Plan as the CCD
determines appropriate and necessary. A Contractor and PCE shall be required to provide any additional
requested compliance documentation within 14 days of request by the CCD.
(1)

If the CCD determines that the Contractor has failed in good faith to comply with a
Utilization Plan and has failed to provide a cure accepted by the CCD in his or her
discretion, the CCD shall notify the CPO of such failure. The CPO shall then send notice
of default to the Contractor, and the Contractor shall have such time to cure the default as
is provided in the Contract. If no such period is provided, the Contractor shall have ten
days to cure such default. For purposes of this section, providing a plan for bringing the
Contract into compliance with the Utilization Plan may constitute a cure, if compliance
cannot reasonably be achieved within the applicable cure period, and if compliance is
achieved in accordance with such plan.

(2)

If a Contractor fails to provide any documentation required by the CCD, the CCD shall
notify the CPO of such failure. The CPO shall then send notice of default to the Contractor,
and the Contractor shall have such time to cure the default as is provided in the Contract.
If no such period is provided, the Contractor shall have ten days to cure such default.

a final decision.
Sec. 34-294. - Annual aspirational goals.
The annual aspirational goals for the utilization of MBEs and WBEs on County Public Works contracts and
subcontracts shall be 24 percent for MBEs and ten percent for WBEs.
Sec. 34-295. - Project specific goals.
The CCD, following the compilation and stringent review of the most current data that is feasibly and
practicably available relative to the availability of MBEs and WBEs who have the capacity to successfully
supply the relevant goods and services, and in consultation with the User Agency, shall establish Project
Specific Goals for construction, which shall be incorporated into each bid and RFP.
Sec. 34-296. - Counting MBE and WBE participation.
***
(h) If a PCE ceases to be certified for any other reason than graduation from the M/WBE Construction

which the Contractor solicited bids or quotations, and if Project Specific Goals have been established, its
achievement of the Goals or its Good Faith Efforts to do so. The Utilization Plan shall be due at the time
the bid/proposal is due. In the event a bid or proposal leads to a Contract with the County, the Utilization
Plan as approved by the CCD shall be incorporated as a material commitment on the part of the Contractor
to each relevant PCE, and the contractor and the County. Failure to include a Utilization Plan shall render
the bid or proposal not Responsive.
(b) Any agreement between a Contractor and an MBE or WBE in which the Contractor requires that the
MBE or WBE not provide subcontracting quotations to other Contractors is prohibited.

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

June 29, 2016

(c) Where the Contractor cannot achieve the Project Specific Goal(s), the CCD will determine whether the
Contractor has made Good Faith Efforts to meet the Goal(s). Parties submitting bids or proposals for
Procurements may in all instances request a partial or full waiver of one or more established Project Specific
Goal for PCE participation. In making this determination, the Director will consider, at a minimum,
whether the Contractor has:
(1)

Solicited through all reasonable and available means (e.g., attendance at pre-bid meetings,
advertising and written notices) the interest of all MBEs and WBEs certified in the scopes
of work of the contract. The Contractor shall provide interested MBEs and WBEs with
timely, adequate information about the plans, specifications, and requirements of the
contract to allow MBEs and WBEs to respond to the solicitation. The Contractor must
follow up initial solicitations with interested MBEs and WBEs.

(2)

Selected portions of the work to be performed by MBEs and WBEs in order to increase the
likelihood that the Project Specific Goals will be achieved. This includes, where
appropriate, breaking out contract work items into economically feasible units to facilitate
MBE and WBE participation, even when the Contractor would otherwise prefer to perform
these work items with its own forces. It is the Contractor's responsibility to make a portion
of the work available to MBEs and WBEs and to select those portions of the work or
material needs consistent with the availability of MBEs and WBEs to facilitate their
participation.

(3)

Negotiated in good faith with interested MBEs and WBEs. Evidence of such negotiation
includes the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of MBEs and WBEs that were
contacted; a description of the information provided regarding the plans and specifications
for the work selected for subcontracting; and why agreements could not be reached with
MBEs and WBEs. The Contractor may not reject MBEs and WBEs as being unqualified
without sound reasons based on a thorough investigation of their capabilities. That there
may be some additional costs involved in finding and using MBEs and WBEs is not in
itself sufficient reason for a Contractor's failure to meet the Project Specific Goals, as long
as such costs are reasonable. The ability or desire of a Contractor to perform the work of a
contract with its own organization does not relieve it of the responsibility to make Good
Faith Efforts on all scopes of work that could be subcontracted.

(4)

Made efforts to assist interested MBEs and WBEs in obtaining bonding, lines of credit, or
insurance as required by the County or the prime Contractor, where appropriate.

(5)

Made efforts to assist interested MBEs and WBEs in obtaining necessary equipment,
supplies, materials, or related assistance or services, where appropriate.

(6)

Used the services of the Office of Contract Compliance, available minority/women
community organizations, minority/women contractors' groups, government-sponsored
minority/women business assistance offices and other appropriate organizations to provide
assistance in the recruitment and placement of MBEs and WBEs.

and detailed subcontractor information to the County with each request for payment submitted to the County

Contractor's books and records, including, without limitation, payroll records, tax returns and records and
books of account, to determine the Contractor's compliance with its commitment to MBE and WBE
participation and the status of any MBE or WBE performing any portion of the contract. This provision
shall be in addition to, and not a substitute for, any other provision allowing inspection of the Contractor's
records by any officer or official of the County for any purpose.
(c) The Contractor cannot make changes to the Utilization Plan or substitute MBEs or WBEs named in the
Utilization Plan without the prior written approval of the CCD, in consultation with the CPO and the User
Agency. Unauthorized changes or substitutions shall be a violation of this subdivision and a breach of
contract, and may constitute grounds for rejection of the bid or proposal or cause termination of the executed
contract for breach, the withholding of payment and/or subject the Contractor to contract penalties or other
sanctions. Upon such written approval by the CCD, the revised Utilization Plan shall be incorporated into
the Contract as an amendment by the CPO. The CCD shall promulgate policies and procedures with
respect to changes to a Utilization Plan.
(1)

All requests for changes or substitutions of an MBE or WBE Subcontractor(s) named in
the Utilization Plan shall be made to the CCD, CPO and the User Agency in writing, and
shall clearly and fully set forth the basis for the request. A Contractor shall not substitute
an MBE or WBE subcontractor or perform the work designated for an MBE or WBE
subcontractor with its own forces unless and until the CCD, in consultation with the CPO
and the User Agency, approves such substitution in writing. A Contractor shall not allow
a substituted subcontractor to begin work until the CCD CPO and the User Agency have
approved the substitution.

Sec. 34-299. - Sanctions and penalties.
(a) In addition to such penalties as are provided in Section 34-175 and Section 34-176, the following
violations of this Section may result in an imposition of penalties as provided herein:

subcontractor, or PCE be disqualified from participation in a County contract for period of
up to five years and contractually penalized in the manner and degree identified by the
CCD, pursuant to the Procurement Code, for a violation of this Section.

(b) In the event a party wishes to pursue administrative review, under Section 34-178, of the CCD's decision
or determination relative to the denial or revocation of certification, or the CCD’s imposition of a penalty
under Section 34-175, Section 34-176 or this Section, said party shall, within 60 days of the Final Notice
issued by the CCD, seek administrative review by submitting a written petition to both the Department of
Administrative Hearings and the CCD, which petition may be supported by information, documents, and
arguments, provided that the information and documents so submitted were available to and in the
possession of the CCD at the time of the Final Notice, and the administrative hearing process shall be
limited to such documents and information as were available to and in possession of the CCD at the time
of such Final Notice, In such administrative review, the petitioning party shall have the burden of proving,
by a preponderance of evidence, that CCD's decision or determination, as set forth in the Final Notice, is
clearly erroneous.

RESOLUTION
Sponsored by
THE HONORABLE JOHN A. FRITCHEY, COUNTY COMMISSIONER
REQUESTING TO PRESENT A PUBLIC QUESTION VIA A COUNTYWIDE REFERENDUM
ABOLISHING THE OFFICE OF THE COOK COUNTY RECORDER OF DEEDS
WHEREAS, Cook County government continues to make concerted efforts to address current and future
budgetary constraints by rightsizing governmental operations, improving efficiency and eliminating
redundancy in operations, among other measures; and
WHEREAS, the County currently has 29 separately elected officials, some of whom oversee administrative
offices; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Recorder of Deeds is tasked with keeping accurate records of land
transactions for public and private review; maintaining official records of Uniform Commercial Code
(UCC), tax liens and lien releases; and recording and maintaining other official records; and
WHEREAS, the key functions of the Cook County Clerk include maintaining vital records and other
official records, administering elections, and maintaining County tax maps and calculating tax rates; and
WHEREAS, functions that are narrowly drawn and administrative in nature provide an excellent
opportunity for consolidation with another office; and
WHEREAS, record-keeping is an administrative function shared by both the County Clerk’s Office and
the County Recorder of Deeds, with many of the Recorder’s duties aligning with already existing divisions
under the Clerk; and
WHEREAS, only two (2) of the ten (10) largest counties in the United States have a separately elected
Recorder of Deeds and Clerk; and
Page 273 of 313

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

June 29, 2016

WHEREAS, it is anticipated that a merger of the Cook County Clerk and Cook County Recorder of Deeds
could save the County over $1 million dollars annually through a more efficient provision of services while
also centralizing record-keeping and improving customer service; and
WHEREAS, Article VII, Section 4(c) of the Constitution of the State of Illinois states, “Any office may
be created or eliminated and the terms of office and manner of selection changed by county-wide
referendum”; and
WHEREAS, 10 ILCS 5/28-8.1(a) states, “Whenever a proposition required by law to be voted upon before
its adoption, other than a constitutional amendment, is submitted to the people, it is the duty of the Secretary
of State to prepare a statement setting forth in detail Section or Sections of the law sought to be amended
by the vote, together with statements and suggestions as may be necessary for a proper understanding of
the proposition. The statements and suggestions shall be submitted to the Attorney General for his
approval”; and
WHEREAS, it is a fundamental underpinning of our great country to provide taxpayers the opportunity to
have input as to the functioning of their government and use of their tax dollars; and
WHEREAS, allowing the voters of Cook County the opportunity to determine the propriety of the
proposed consolidation via a binding referendum is an opportunity to engage residents directly in our
democratic process; and
WHEREAS, in order to consolidate and improve services by merging the functions and responsibilities of
the office of the Recorder of Deeds into the office of the Cook County Clerk, the Cook County Board of
Commissioners seeks to place a question before the electorate via a referendum on the November 8, 2016,
countywide ballot seeking to eliminate the office of the Cook County Recorder of Deeds and merge its
functions into those of the Cook County Clerk, as follows:
“Shall the Office of the Cook County Recorder of Deeds be eliminated and all duties and
responsibilities of the Office of the Cook County Recorder of Deeds be transferred to, and assumed
by, the Office of the Cook County Clerk by December 1, 2018 December 7, 2020.
[ ] Yes
[ ] No”
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that this Board
present the aforementioned question to the electorate via a countywide referendum on the November 8,
2016 ballot; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Clerk notifies the Secretary of State, and the
Attorney General of this request for action...end
