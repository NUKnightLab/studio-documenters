**Report from Chief of Human Resources (continued)
Director Wiese inquired regarding the identity of some of the System’s partners for recruitment and posting of
positions. Ms. Lopez responded that currently, the System’s positions are posted on Taleo. Additionally, the
System has a contract with TMP Advertising; this vendor “scrapes” the system’s positions so that they appear on
several job search websites, including Indeed.com, SimplyHired.com and MedicalWorkers.com. She noted that
she recently met with John Cookinham, System Chief Financial Officer, to discuss the subject of possible job
search websites unique to finance-related positions that could be used when recruiting and posting positions for
the Finance Department. She added that once the recruitment function is built, a list will be available of all the
different sites on which System positions can be posted, particularly for critical hires. Director Wiese requested
that a list of sites that are currently being utilized be provided1. Ms. Lopez indicated that she will provide this
information.
Ms. Lopez provided an update on an initiative started at the request of former Committee Chair Quin Golden; this
initiative involves an analysis of System contracts to determine which services currently being provided
contractually can be brought in-house. She stated that progress on the analysis continues; the goal is to complete
the analysis and begin working with the hiring managers in the affected areas to determine when the transition can
take place and when posting of positions can begin, in order to bring services in-house.
Board Chairman Carvalho noted that one of the issues that this Committee has discussed in the past is that there
have been some challenges experienced in filling some positions that are non-union, when the salary is outside of
the range of the position as determined by a County entity related to position classification. Dr. Ram Raju, Chief
Executive Officer, responded that staff from the County’s Bureau of Human Resources has been very helpful to
him when this type of situation arises – he has been successful in his efforts when this has happened, but it
requires a phone call to discuss the situation each time it happens. Overall, as Chief Executive Officer of the
System, his perspective is that he should be able to figure out who the right talent is and what the System pays
them. It would be very helpful for the Chief Executive Officer to identify the candidate and also be able to set the
salary, commensurate with the market, as long as it is in the budget.
Director Ramirez noted that authority was granted to the System Board, giving them the ability to make intra-fund
transfers. Board Chairman Carvalho concurred, and stated that the Board is fine with Dr. Raju paying people
what he needs to be paying them, and the Board has the authority to authorize Dr. Raju to transfer funds. He
stated that apparently the hiccup is coming in the processing of the paperwork, which continues to be done by
County staff. Rather than fixing the issue situationally, he asked if counsel can review the subject to determine
what precisely needs to be changed to eliminate that hiccup. Elizabeth Reidy, System General Counsel, provided
a brief overview of the authority granted to the System Board under the Enabling Ordinance, with regard to
human resources. She indicated that she and her staff will review the subject and return with further information2.
Director Wiese, seconded by Director Ramirez, moved to accept the Report from the Chief
of Human Resources. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
