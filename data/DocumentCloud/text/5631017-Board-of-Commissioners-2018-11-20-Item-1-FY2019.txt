GENERAL BACKGROUND
The Chicago Housing Authority is required to submit for approval by the Board, a balanced

The FY2019 Comprehensive Budget totaling $1.104 billion includes the following fund
categories:
•

MTW Fund. Total sources for FY2019 is $836.5 million. The MTW Fund combines the
Low-Rent, Capital and Section 8 programs into a block grant as allowed by HUD under
the Amended and Restated MTW agreement. Total MTW Fund revenues consist of
Housing Assistance Subsidy, Capital Grant Funds, Operating Subsidy, MTW Reserves,
Block Grant, Dwelling Rental Income, RAD, Interest Income and Other Income.

•

Section 8 Fund (Non-MTW). Total sources for this program is $19.3 million. These
contracts provide appropriations for approximately $7.5 million of Mod Rehab vouchers,
$11.4 million Veteran’s Affairs Supportive Housing (VASH) vouchers, and $471.1
thousand Mainstream vouchers for housing assistance based on annual contributions
contracts from HUD.

 •

Hope VI Fund. Total sources equal $400 thousand. These funds are used for
revitalization and community and supportive services programs.

•

Other Funds. Total sources are $247.5 million. $109.7 million of proceeds from the
$325 million bond issue that closed in September 2018 will be used to fund capital
maintenance and repairs at CHA public housing and provide loans to mixed-income
developments. Additionally, other federal and local grants will be used to enhance or
augment funding for critical programs and services that the CHA provides to its
residents.

The estimated sum of all sources for FY2019 is equal to the estimated sum of all
expenditures to be made/incurred during FY2019.
