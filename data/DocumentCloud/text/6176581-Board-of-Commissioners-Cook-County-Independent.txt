annual basis to be updated and provide quarterly updates to the Board of Commissioners.

Cigarette Taxes, Fuel Taxes and other sources of County revenue. The Commission will also be
responsible for evaluating and forecasting any new revenue sources proposed by the Board and
or Executive.
The Commission is comprised of two academic economists with expertise in local economic
conditions housed at a University located in Cook County and one member of the public with
