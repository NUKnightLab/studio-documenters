1

 (Item 1)
The resolution for Item 1 approves the refinance of the Presbyterian Homes acquisition financing in an
amount not to exceed $20 million. The new credit facility will terminate on December 31, 2017. In January
2016, the Board of Commissioners approved the purchase of Crowder Place (3801 N. Pine Grove, 41 units),
Mulvey Place (416 W Barry, 37 units), and Devon Place (1950 W. Devon, 33 units) collectively known as
Presbyterian Homes (2016-CHA-11). This acquisition was funded through a One Year Term Loan
[subsequently modified in October 2016, for rate and revolving capacity, (2016-CHA-111)] in the amount of
$20 million. That facility is expiring March 1, 2017. The timeline for rehabilitation and permanent financing
for these properties will be concluded prior to December 31, 2017 in accordance with Property Division
planned activities.

WHEREAS,

RESOLUTION NO. 2017-CHA-13
the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the
Board Letter dated February 21, 2017 entitled “AUTHORIZATION TO
REFINANCE THE PRESBYTERIAN HOMES LINE OF CREDIT UTILIZING
THE BMO HARRIS MASTER CREDIT FACILITY IN AN AMOUNT NOT TO
EXCEED $20 MILLION AND TO PERFORM SUCH ACTIONS AS MAY BE
NECESSARY OR APPROPRIATE TO IMPLEMENT THE FOREGOING”.

THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF THE
CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY:
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners hereby authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to refinance the Presbyterian Homes line of credit utilizing the BMO Harris
Master Credit Facility in an amount not to exceed $20 million and to perform such
actions as may be necessary or appropriate to implement the foregoing.

(Item 1A)
The resolution for Item 1A approves entering into a Public Private Partnership (P-3) commercial
transaction with 1300 W. Devon Partners, LLC, and to invest an amount not exceed $1,250,000 in nonfederal funds into the partnership. In November 2015, the CHA, the City of Chicago and the MacArthur
Foundation collaborated to host a forum for developers inviting them to new partnerships in residential
and commercial development. Subsequently, the Revenue and Partnerships Department was created with
a mission to generate alternative revenue streams for CHA. During 2016, that approach led to several
innovative transactions which resulted in several million dollars of cost savings/revenue generation.
Following a CHA competitive Request for Proposal process, the CHA Board of Commissioners
authorized the CHA to enter into negotiations with Three Corners Development to develop 6418 N.
Sheridan Road, the parking area located just north of the Caroline Hedger Apartments and enter into a
long term ground lease. Three Corners Development, an affiliate of 1300 W. Devon Partners, LLC,
proposed a concept to develop 6418 N. Sheridan into a mixed-use development comprised of
approximately 111 mixed-income residential units and approximately 30,000 square feet of commercial
retail space, anchored by a Target store. In an effort to develop value for land, contribute to a CHA
mixed-income residential project, as well as to share in an annual non-federal revenue stream, Three
Corners Development initiated discussions with CHA in connection with an investment partnership
involving cash, equity and real estate contributions by both parties. This innovative partnership is
designed to be an “open book pricing model” with CHA contributing up to $1.25 million in non-federal
cash as well as $1 million capital valuation for the 25% of land value from CHA’s parking lot appraisal.
Three Corner Developments will contribute $3.5 million in cash and ownership interest in the Devon
Collection to the Partnership. The Devon Collection is a completed mixed-use real estate project located
2

 on Devon Avenue immediately west of the Hedger Apartments, consisting of 22 market rate apartments,
23 parking spaces and 11,500 square feet of retail space. CHA would be admitted to the 1300 W.
Devon, LLC as a 40% ownership member. All related partnership financing would be guaranteed by
majority partnership interest and result in no-recourse debt to CHA.
RESOLUTION NO. 2017-CHA-14
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the Board
Letter dated February 21, 2017 entitled “AUTHORIZATION TO ENTER INTO A
PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP (P-3) COMMERCIAL TRANSACTION WITH
1300 W. DEVON PARTNERS, LLC, TO 1) INVEST AN AMOUNT NOT TO
EXCEED $1,250,0000 IN NON-FEDERAL FUNDS INTO THE PARTNERSHIP, 2) TO
NEGOTIATE AND EXECUTE TRANSACTION AND RELATED FINANCING
DOCUMENTS, AND 3) TO PERFORM SUCH ACTIONS AS MAY BE NECESSARY
AND APPROPRIATE TO IMPLEMENT THE FOREGOING.
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF THE
CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY:
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to
enter into a public private partnership (P-3) commercial transaction with 1300 W. Devon
Partners, LLC, to 1) invest non-federal funds in an amount not to exceed $1,250,000 into
the partnership, 2) to negotiate and execute transaction and related financing documents,
and 3) to perform such actions as may be necessary and appropriate to implement the
foregoing.

(Item 2)
The resolution for Item 2 approves the execution of one or more Agreements with Yardi Systems Inc. or
an affiliate in an aggregate amount of $6,777,019 for a three-year base term, with two one-year options
to provide software licenses and subscriptions, system maintenance and support, and upgraded
functionality to the CHA’s Yardi Housing Management System, as well as professional consulting
services for implementation of the Yardi base system and enhanced system upgrades. In 2003, the CHA
implemented the Yardi Housing Management Software as their Property and Voucher Management
System. The existing Yardi Support and Maintenance Agreement includes technical support and
product maintenance, including fixes and updates to the software. In October 2008, CHA elected to
license additional upgrade modules from the Yardi software, including the vendor’s Customer Service,
Portfolio Management Dashboard and Web Portal Modules. The new Yardi upgrade will provide CHA
with integrated access to the Resident Screening module, which will enable the CHA/HCV and Public
Housing to perform criminal, tenancy and credit background checks directly in the Yardi System. The
original procurement of the Yardi Housing Management Software and implementation services was
conducted through a competitive solicitation that was awarded in 2003 to Deloitte & Touche, who was
engaged to implement the Yardi Voyager® platform as the CHA’s system of choice. Following the
completed Voyager implementation, Yardi has continued to support the CHA with systems support and
software maintenance since the system was put into production. Due to the proprietary nature of the
software system, the sole source process continues as a necessary procurement requirement for the
maintenance, support and upgrades to the Yardi platform and applications.
RESOLUTION NO. 2016-CHA-15
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the Board
Letter dated February 21, 2017 entitled “Recommendation to Enter into one or more
Contracts with Yardi Systems, Inc. or an affiliate for Professional Services to Implement
3

 Upgrades and Enhancements to the Yardi Housing Management System,” in an amount
not-to-exceed $6,777,019.
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF THE
CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY:
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to
enter into one or more contracts with Yardi Systems, Inc. or an affiliate for professional
services to supply Yardi software licenses and subscriptions, to implement upgrades and
enhancements to the Yardi Housing Management System, and to perform related
migration services for CHA’s housing management, screening and service portals, for a
three (3) year base term with two (2) one-year options, in an aggregate total not-to-exceed
amount of compensation of $6,777,019.
This award is subject to the Contractor’s compliance with the CHA’s applicable
MBE/WBE/DBE/ Section 3 hiring and insurance requirements.

(Item 3)
The resolution for Item 3 approves a land lease agreement with Sinai Health System for the vacant
Ogden Courts site located between the 2600 and the 2700 block of Ogden Avenue through the execution
of an initial one-year lease agreement with two consecutive one-year option renewal terms. The former
Project-Based-Section 8 development known as Ogden Courts, a city/state development located between
the 2600 and the 2700 block of Ogden Avenue was demolished in 2006. In 2008, Sinai Health System
proposed to lease the Site for the purpose of constructing a Sinai staff and visitor parking lot in order to
reduce the traffic and parking congestion in the community. In August 2008, the Board approved the
execution of an initial three-year land lease agreement for the Site, with two consecutive one-year option
extensions at a rate of $100 per month. The 2008 lease and the two consecutive one-year option renewal
terms expired as of November 2013 and the lease continued on a month to month basis. Sinai is now
seeking to enter into a new one-year lease with two consecutive one-year option renewals. The land will
continue to be leased at less than fair market value, however as an added public benefit, Sinai will
provide training and employment opportunities for six CHA residents in the areas of nursing, food
service, technician, health educator and environmental. Additionally, they will continue to maintain the
land adjacent to the property to include landscaping, snow removal and collection of refuse during the
term of the lease. The community will also benefit through reduced parking congestion in the area.
RESOLUTION NO. 2017-CHA-16
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the Board
Letter dated February 21, 2017 entitled “Request for Authorization to Enter into A Land
Lease Agreement with Sinai Health System for The Vacant Ogden Courts Site Located
between The 2600 And 2700 Block of Ogden Avenue”
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF THE CHICAGO
HOUSING AUTHORITY:
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to
enter into a land lease agreement with Sinai Health System for the vacant Ogden Courts
site located between the 2600 and the 2700 block of Ogden Avenue.

(Item 4)
The resolution for Item 4 approves an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with the Chicago Police
Department (CPD) for a two-year period from January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2018 to provide
supplemental police services for CHA properties and programs in an amount not-to-exceed $6,000,000
annually with the ability to increase the amount not-to-exceed to $8,000,000 annually, subject to CEO
approval and budget authorization. The CHA originally entered into an IGA with the Chicago Police
Department for supplemental police services in 2000 after disbanding the CHA Police. Since that time,
the CHA has continued with this approach of providing supplemental police services through subsequent
IGAs and amendments. The IGA allows CPD to continue to provide specialized policing programs at
designated CHA properties, as assigned. These supplemental police services include: dedicated watches
for Cabrini Rowhouses, Henry Horner/Westhaven, Altgeld/Murray, Lake Parc Place, Brooks, Oakwood
Shores, Park Boulevard, Jackson Square, Wentworth Gardens, Dearborn, Trumbull Park, and/or other
CHA communities, as needed; increased police services for the selected developments, including
increased foot patrols; customized policing strategy constructed by CHA, property managers, and CPD;
attendance at monthly community security meetings to increase visibility in the community; monitoring
and prevention of gang activities and monitoring of drug and other illegal activities. Supplemental CPD
services also include attendance at all court hearings for all arrests made by the police officers;
responding to acts of domestic violence; responding to unauthorized or unlawful activities or entries into
residences; providing a dedicated CPD staff member for crime data analysis, statistics and crime reports
and additional coverage for summer surge and lease enforcement actions, as needed.

(Item 5)
The resolution for Item 5 authorizes staff to proceed with the application process for properties utilizing
transfer of assistance under the Rental Assistance Demonstration Program for the properties at 2031-37
N. Milwaukee and 5525 W. Diversey. The properties would be funded as RAD transfer of assistance
properties from Lathrop Homes. The RAD project-based voucher (PBV) funding at the properties will
allow for flexibility to leverage financing for property improvements as needs arise. The redevelopment
of Lathrop Homes will result in more than 1,000 residential units of which 400 are planned to be RAD
PBV units for public housing eligible residents. In addition to the 400 RAD PBV units planned for the
Lathrop site, CHA is seeking 525 other units on the north side of Chicago to subsidize with RAD PBV
assistance transferred from Lathrop Homes. 2037 N. Milwaukee is a planned mixed-income, new
construction building. The property is in a Gautreaux General Area, and two blocks from a CHA
Opportunity Area. 5525 W. Diversey is a planned mixed-use, mixed-income, new construction building.
The property is in both a Gautreaux General Area, and CHA Opportunity Area. Metropolitan Housing
Development Corporation (MHDC), a not-for-profit developer, owner and manager of affordable
housing, will develop both properties. MHDC is located in Chicago and has produced more than 2,000
new or rehabbed units for low and moderate income families and the elderly. They also work with local

 (Item 6)
The resolution for Item 6 approves the second one-year option and an additional $1,000,000 in funding
for each of the following four Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for Authoritywide environmental consulting services in connection with modernization, rehabilitation, new

construction activities: 1) Contract 11421 with Environmental Design International 2) Contract 11423
with Terracon; 3) Contract 11420 with Carnow Conibear and Associates Ltd. ; and 4) Contract 11422
with GSG Consultants, Inc. The total aggregate amount of additional funding for the four contracts will
be an amount not-to-exceed $4,000,000.00. The current program’s funds have been depleted and the
additional funding will ensure CHA can continue to issue task orders on an as-needed basis as projects
are identified. Each Task Order opportunity is competitively bid among the four vendors in the Program
and is assigned to lowest bidder. Before the expiration of the last option year term, the CHA plans to
solicit these services. The CHA is in need of continuing these environmental consulting services as
required by law to meet various project milestones. These contracts provide environmental oversight,
testing and inspection services for the Capital Construction, Development and Property Office.
RESOLUTION NO. 2017-CHA-19
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated February 21, 2017
entitled “Authorization to Exercise the Second Option Year and Additional Funding for
the Authority-Wide Environmental Consulting Program”;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF THE
CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY:

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to
authorize the exercise of the second one-year option term for the period of April 1, 2017
through March 31, 2018, and to provide an additional $1,000,000 in funding for each of
the following four Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for
environmental consulting services: 1) Contract 11421 with Environmental Design

(Item No. 7)
A Request for Qualifications (RFQ) was issued in September 2016 to solicit professional architectural
and engineering firms to provide complete architectural/engineering services in connection with
modernization, rehabilitation, and capital maintenance at CHA properties as part of the
Architectural/Engineering Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Program. Specific scopes of
work will be provided to the awardees through individual task orders. Thirty-nine Respondents
submitted proposals for four Categories of Services: 1) Architectural Design, 2) Civil Engineering and
Landscape Design, 3) Structural Engineering, and 4) Mechanical, Electrical, Plumbing Fire Protection,
7

 and Information Technology Engineering. The CHA is recommending to award a total of thirty-nine
IDIQ contracts to the below listed contractors for a not-to-exceed amount of $24,050,000. Each contract
will be for an amount not-to-exceed $750,000.00 or $350,000.00 based on the category of services
assignment for a base term of two years with two one-year renewal options. An additional
$10,950,000.00 will be set-aside as reserve capacity from which funds can be allocated. The total
aggregate amount of the thirty-nine contracts and the reserve capacity fund is a not-to-exceed
$35,000,000.00. The CHA amends base contract amounts as necessary utilizing the set aside reserve
capacity fund, as task orders are assigned. Task Order and IDIQ contracts streamline the procurement
process. The CHA’s new Architectural/Engineering IDIQ Program will utilize the same next in line
rotation for assignments but will also assign task orders based on a vendor’s specialization or category or
service. Design work will be assigned through two processes; 1) For projects with an estimated
professional design fee of $1,000,000 or less, task orders will be assigned through a next in line rotation,
2) For projects with an estimated professional design fee greater than $1,000,000 to $1,999,999, the
CHA will solicit the task order opportunity to all vendors in the applicable Category of Service.

A total of ten responsive bids were received before the due date and Madison Construction submitted the
lowest lump sum bid in the amount of $7,837,000. Accordingly, the resolution for Item 8 approves
award of contract to Madison Construction for the complete renovation of the Henry Horner Town
Homes Annex in the firm fixed price of $7,837,000.00 plus a not-to-exceed amount of $470,220.00 in
contingency, strictly limited to potential change orders justified as discovered conditions or code
compliance issues for a total not-to-exceed amount of $8,307,220.00. The Henry Horner Annex is
located on one city block, bounded on the east by Wood Street, on the north by Monroe Street, on the
west by Honore Street, and on the south by Adams Street. According to an assessment report on the
townhomes prepared by Holabird & Root, LLC., in March 2015, the overall condition of the townhomes
is extremely poor. There is extensive water damage throughout due to broken plumbing and water
infiltration through the exterior masonry. The water damage has caused significant mold growth which
requires abatement and damaged all interior finishes, framing, flooring, doors and cabinetry. The overall
structural framing is stable. The exterior steel stairs and porches are corroded and in need of
replacement. The property also needs accessibility upgrades. The townhomes renovation project will
require the general contractor to remove and replace all interior finishes, drywall, doors, flooring,
kitchen and bathroom cabinetry and all mechanical, electrical and plumbing systems in 31 units. The
contractor will also be expected to remove and replace the exterior steel stairs and porches and
implement the required accessibility upgrades.

(Item 11)
The resolution for Item 11 approves submittal of a Disposition Application to HUD for the disposition of
property comprising the Lakefront Phase II for Sale Development site. Lakefront Phase II is the final
phase of redevelopment of Lakefront Properties, a site formerly comprised of four public housing highrise buildings with a total of 604 units. The redevelopment is bounded by 40th Street on the North, 42nd
Place on the South, Lake Park Avenue on the West and the Metra railway line on the East. A master
plan was accepted by the Board in January 2002 to redevelop Lakefront Properties into a new mixedincome redevelopment in the Oakland community area on the south side of Chicago. When completed,
the redeveloped Lakefront Properties site will house a total of 485 units. The developer of Phase I,
referred to as Lake Park Crescent, delivered the first 216 units, of which 148 units were completed in
2005 in Phase 1 Rental, and the 68 remaining units of Phase 1A For-Sale were completed in 2008. On
September 21, 2006, the Lakefront Working Group (also referred to as the Lake Park Crescent Working
Group) recommended the selection of Davis Associates Managers LLC as the master developer of the
redevelopment of Lakefront Phase II. The developer was selected for their proposal to seamlessly
integrate 269 new housing units with the surrounding community and street grid while adhering to the
restrictions of the existing master plan. On November 21, 2006, the Board authorized the Chief
Executive Officer or his designee to enter into Development Agreement negotiations with Davis
Associates Managers LLC. The Development Agreement called for the development of Phase II, a
mixed-income community with 132 rental units and 137 for sale units. The developer of the Phase II
site, referred to as Sullivan Station, has completed the 132 mixed income rental housing units, including
47 for public housing residents. To date CHA has received a total of 120 public housing units (73 in
Phases I and IA and 47 in Phase II). The developer plans to begin its marketing efforts for the remaining
137 Phase II For Sale units in Spring 2017. This disposition activity was identified in the CHA FY2016
MTW Annual Plan approved by HUD.

(Item 12)
The resolution for Item 12 approves submission of a Disposition Application to HUD for the disposition
of property located at 1500 North Larrabee Street. In 2014, the CHA entered into a Land Transfer
Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with the City of Chicago and the Chicago Park District (CPD).
This IGA stipulated that the City convey and CHA acquire the Near North High School and adjacent
field (the NNHS Property) at 1450 -1500 North Larrabee Street. In exchange for the NNHS Property,
the CHA agreed to convey certain land that it owned at the former Harold Ickes Homes site. On August
17, 2015, the CHA acquired the NNHS Property and transferred its designated land to the City. The
City, thereafter, conveyed the Harold Ickes Homes property for the construction of a new artificial turf
field and running track for Jones College Prep High School. The NNHS Property the CHA received
contains two parcels with separate addresses. The subject of this Board action is the parcel of property
with the address of 1500 North Larrabee and is currently a ballfield. The parcel of the property with the
address of 1450 North Larrabee is the former CPS Near North High School building. Both parcels,
collectively, have been identified as part of the revitalization of the former Cabrini‐Green and included
in the Cabrini Consent Decree. The redevelopment of the NNHS ballfield parcel was planned through
the Near North Working Group under the Development Zone Plan (DPZ), a framework for the Cabrini
redevelopment activities. A community meeting regarding the proposed disposition has been held. The
NNHS ballfield at 1500 North Larrabee was designated under the Cabrini-Green DZP as a much needed
community park. It is currently being leased by several community sports organizations until such time
the CHA transfers the property to CPD. CPD will own and operate the park for the community to enjoy.
This disposition activity was identified in the CHA FY2015 MTW Annual Plan approved by HUD.
Commissioners Harte and Washington abstained from voting on Item 12 only. Item 12 was approved by
majority vote.

(Item 13)
The resolution for Item 13 approves the issuance and delivery of an additional Multifamily Housing
Revenue Note, 2017 Series A (Sterling Park Apartments) in a principal amount not to exceed $10,000,000
(Series 2017 A Note). Sterling Park, located at 3301 W. Arthington, is an adaptive re-use of a vacant, four
and six-story masonry, historic industrial office and research facility formerly owned by the Sears and
Roebuck Company in the Homan Square neighborhood on the West Side of Chicago. The Sterling Park
property is bounded by W. Arthington Street on the North, S. Spaulding Avenue on the East, Sears/Homan
Square buildings on the West and the train trestle on the South. Sterling is a single phase, 181-unit affordable
development that will provide 66 public housing and 115 affordable units with a mix of one to four bedroom
units, on-site parking, an outdoor courtyard and play space. The first floor of the building will provide a
computer lab and fitness room for the exclusive use of residents, as well as a community room for meetings
and special events. Sterling Park is being developed by Mercy Housing Lakefront (MHL), a national nonprofit developer of affordable housing, in partnership with Boulevard Group, a national developer
specializing in the development of mixed-income public housing.
The Sterling Park Apartments
transaction closed in June, 2015. During demolition after closing, structural deterioration was discovered
affecting the roof, façade and interior, plus unforeseen additional environmental issues. These discoveries
resulted in significant unexpected costs to the project to be addressed. CHA plans to issue, execute and
deliver no more than $10 Million of additional tax-exempt multifamily housing revenue bond volume cap
ceded to the CHA from the City of Chicago. In March 2015, the CHA Board of Commissioners authorized a
prior issuance of a Multifamily Housing Revenue Note not to exceed $30 million. The CHA actually issued
$29,500,000 in a 2015 Series A in June, 2015. The revised total estimated budget for Sterling Park
Apartments is approximately $63.8 million. The $7.6 million net increase to the total budget will be
covered primarily with $4.5 million from MHL, the developer, and $2.9 million of additional equity. CHA
will not provide any new loan funds for this development; the original CHA Loan of $19,715,758 remains
unchanged. The Series 2017 A Note will be issued in one series pursuant to appropriate legal loan
documentation and the proceeds thereof will be loaned to the Owner, pursuant to a loan agreement. The
Series 2017 A Note is not a debt of any city, village, incorporated town or country, or the State of Illinois or
any political subdivision thereof, other than the Authority. The Series 2017 A Note is a special limited
obligation of the Authority payable solely from the sources specified in the loan agreement. The Series 2017
A Note will be issued on a subordinated basis to the Series 2015 A Note. The principal amount for Sterling
Park Apartments tax exempt notes issued in 2015 and subsequent years will not exceed an aggregate amount
of $39,500,000.

(Item 14)
CHA released a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) for Mixed Finance Pre-Qualification for Development
Teams on September 2016. The RFQ provides a method to pre-qualify developers and creates
opportunities for CHA to provide capital loans and operating funds for new construction and
rehabilitation of multi-family, mixed income and mixed use projects that directly benefit CHA residents.
CHA directly solicited 102 vendors and placed advertisement in area newspapers; industry websites and
the CHA Web-site. A total of four proposals were received. Proposals were evaluated and scored based
on the evaluation criteria. At the Board meeting held on December 6, 2016, the Board approved the
award of three Development Teams for mixed income unit delivery. In furtherance of its objective to
21

 provide housing through mixed income developments, the CHA seeks to be more inclusive in the
selection of recommended developers consistent with the CHA’s M/WBE and Section 3 program and
therefore is seeking to add to its pool the final firm, SourceWorks, which responded to the September
2016 RFQ procurement process. Accordingly, the resolution for Item 14 approves SourceWorks
Development, LLC as a Development Team for mixed income unit delivery. SourceWorks is a WBE
certified firm with experience in the planning, development and management of affordable housing,
including seniors affordable housing.
