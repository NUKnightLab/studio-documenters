The requested action in this item complies in all material respects with all applicable
federal, state and local laws and Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) board policies. Staff

Background
The Altgeld Family Resource Center (AFRC) will be located on CHA-owned land in the
Altgeld-Murray housing development area, a 168-acre site containing approximately
1,550 units of housing that is eligible for inclusion on the national register of historic
places. The Altgeld-Murray site includes an elementary school, high school, property
management hub, and social services office. The AFRC will provide the following
amenities to the community:
• 21,000 sq. ft. Early Learning Center
• 9,000 sq. ft. Community Space
• 10,000 sq. ft. Chicago Public Library
The Early Learning Center & Community Facility
The new center will accommodate up to 130 children with 12 classrooms, a motor skills
room, and a music activity space. The facility will provide a parent resource center,
indoor recreation space, after school programming, as well as community rooms
available for resident and community use.
Library
The new state of the art library is expected to serve 60,000 visitors a year. Services will
include: free homework assistance for students, resume and job seeking support for
adults, programming for seniors, offer high speed internet access, Wi-Fi, computer labs,
digital lab for teens, and lending wireless hotspots so that patrons can access the
internet at home.
Financing
The Board previously authorized CHA to enter-into a construction contract for the
project for approximately $22 million in hard costs. The Board also approved use of the
line of credit CHA has with BMO Harris up to $8 million to pay for the project.
The Altgeld Family Resource Center was designated under the 2013 Altgeld Murray
Master Plan as a much-needed community facility. It will consolidate and expand
existing community resources into a state of the art facility and increase the capacity for
all. A to-be-formed New Market’s Tax Credit eligible entity will own and operate the
facility for the community to enjoy and maintain long term leases with the day care
provider and Chicago Public Library.

 The ownership entity will have to indemnify the NMTC investors against an event of
recapture. Indemnification of investors is a customary practice to protect investors
from recapture of credits due to non-compliance or default by the owner of the real
estate in NMTC transactions. Additionally, CHA, as owner of the land, will also be
required to indemnify the NMTC investors against any environmental liability that may
result from the presence of environmental contaminates which may be present at the
site.
