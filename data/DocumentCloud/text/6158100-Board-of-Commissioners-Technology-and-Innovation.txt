FEE-BASED PARKING INITIATIVE REPORT DEADLINE
WHEREAS, on January 9, 2007, the Cook County Board of Commissioners approved Resolution 07-R45, Fee-Based Parking Initiative; and

the Cook County Department of Facilities Management and the Cook County Department of Revenue to
“assemble a plan to create, implement and enforce fee-based parking for all Cook County owned parking
lots that do not already have such a program in place;” and

a fee-based parking initiative before the Cook County Board of Commissioners in time to help offset
some of the historic County deficit for fiscal year 2007; and
WHEREAS, Resolution 07-R-45 did not set a deadline for the fee-based parking initiative report to be

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
PERFORMANCE-BASED SERVICE CONTRACTING INITIATIVE
WHEREAS, Cook County is faced with a historic budget deficit for fiscal year 2007 that exceeds $500
million; and
WHEREAS, Cook County has vigorously sought to identify cost-saving opportunities which has
necessitated reductions in mission critical services and reductions in the workforce; and
WHEREAS, Cook County continues to increase spending on Professional Service and Managerial
Service contracts at an annual compounded growth rate of 50%; and
WHEREAS, Cook County needs to be able to demonstrate to taxpayers and its employees, the
operational and financial benefits of said contracts; and
WHEREAS, Performance-Based Contracting is a procurement method that focuses on achieving predefined outcome rather than focusing on the vendor or the activities; and
WHEREAS, Performance-Based Contracting is tied to metrics and standards that can be measured and
audited; and
WHEREAS, for the past decade, the federal government, as well as many state and local governments,
have successfully adopted Performance-Based Contracting for this expressed purpose; and
WHEREAS, under performance-based contracting, Cook County would have the option of exercising
Gain-Sharing whereby zero payments would be made to contractors and they would instead share in
revenue gains; and

806

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 21, 2007
WHEREAS, an immediate benefit from Performance-Based Contracting is that it provides a proven
framework that enhances the outcomes associated with said contracts and helps to materially reduce
financial risk and cash outlays, which in turn save the County millions of dollars annually which
promotes transparency, accountability, and good governances.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners requests
that the Office of the Chief Purchasing Agent, under the direction of Cook County’s Chief Financial
Officer, shall formulate a phased plan to implement and enforce: Performance Based Contracting for
Professional Service and Managerial Service Contracts; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that this plan should be presented to the Board, no later than April 12,
2007, and until such time that this plan is reviewed by the Board, a moratorium shall be placed on all
professional service and managerial service contracts.

CONTRACT RENEWAL
Transmitting a Communication from
RUPERT F. GRAHAM, JR., P.E., Acting Superintendent of Highways
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to renew Contract No. 06-45-569 with Bentley
Systems, Inc., Exton, Pennsylvania, for the purchase of MicroStation software.

811

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 21, 2007

Reason:

Bentley Systems, Inc. is the sole creator and sole distributor of MicroStation software. The
Highway Department uses MicroStation to produce and manage engineering drawings of
county roads and facilities. The Illinois Department of Transportation has chosen
MicroStation as its drafting and design software standard. A previous action of the board
allows the department to make all purchases of Bentley Systems, Inc.’s products under the
State of Illinois contract and discount.
By renewing under the terms of Contract No. 06-45-569, the county will save over
$10,400.00 this year in maintenance fees alone. These savings will be repeated and possibly
increased every year from now until either the State of Illinois or Cook County decides to
terminate the agreement.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $25,970.00. Contract period: May 15, 2006 through May 14, 2007. (501-441
Account). Requisition No. 75011100.

Commissioner Silvestri stated that this is a fee for a service that we are currently providing for free, and
that it will generate approximately $1 million per year.
Commissioner Suffredin voiced his approval of this item and stated that the County should have been
licensing these databases in the past. He further stated that this item was part of Assessor Houlihan’s
proposed revenue projections.
Chairman Daley inquired of John Fallon, Special Assistant to the Assessor, Cook County Assessor’s
Office, whether this $1.1 million revenue estimate was discussed with Comptroller Knorr.

847

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 21, 2007
Mr. Fallon stated that he did attempt to reach Mr. Knorr prior to his departure. He further stated that he
met with the Budget Department yesterday.
Barbara Bruno, Director, Cook County Department of Revenue, stated that the Department of Revenue
had not analyzed any of these numbers.
Mr. Fallon stated that the figures are generated by a conservative estimate of eight users at $60,000 and
twenty users at $30,000.
Chairman Daley stated that if this expected revenue is not generated in full, the balance will be removed
from the Cook County’s Assessor’s budget.
Mr. Fallon replied that he and his colleagues are very confident that all projected revenue will be
generated. He further stated that the Assessor’s Office is preparing to use some of this projected revenue
toward meeting the 17% budget cuts.
Chairman Daley asked leave to add all Commissioners as co-sponsors.
Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Murphy, moved that the proposed ordinance
(Communication Number 284782) be approved and adopted. The motion carried.

Sims and Jerry Butler, County Commissioners; Co-Sponsored by William Beavers, Forrest
Claypool, Earlean Collins, John P. Daley, Roberto Maldonado, Joseph Mario Moreno, Joan
Patricia Murphy, Mike Quigley, Robert B. Steele and Larry Suffredin, County
Commissioners.
PROPOSED ORDINANCE
COOK COUNTY INTER-TRACK WAGERING LOCATION

The inter-track wagering location licensee shall collect the Cook County Inter-Track

Sec. 54-335. Effective date.

Commissioners.
Secs. 54-326 – 54-329. Reserved.
*Referred to the Committee on Finance as amended on 02/06/07.
Commissioner Silvestri inquired how this entry fee relates to other municipalities with betting facilities.
Ms. Bruno replied that the Illinois Compiled Statutes allow a local municipality and county to collectively
levy two dollars. She further stated that, to her knowledge, the City of Chicago is the only municipality
that is currently charging one dollar.
Patrick T. Driscoll, Jr., Deputy State’s Attorney, Chief, Civil Actions Bureau, further clarified that both
the municipality’s levy and the County’s levy are capped at one dollar each.
Ms. Bruno read the following excerpt from the Illinois Compiled Statutes: “Any municipality or County
that has a board-licensed inter-track wagering location, board-licensing meaning the Illinois Racing
Board, a facility wholly within its corporate boundaries, may each impose an admission fee not to exceed
one dollar per admission to such inter-track wagering location facility, so that a total of not more than two
dollars per admission may be imposed.”
Commissioner Goslin inquired if the revenue would be routed to the Cook County Bureau of Health
Services.
Thomas J. Glaser, Chief Financial Officer, replied that this can be done, but that if the revenue were sent
to the General Fund, it could instead be allocated according to need.
Commissioner Schneider voiced the following reasons that the tax would prove detrimental to the
County: The levy would act as a disincentive to OTB patrons at a time when the industry is already in

849

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 21, 2007
decline. With loss of patrons, related spending would decline (in areas such as meals and alcoholic
beverages). This would result in lower sales tax revenue for the County.
Commissioner Beavers inquired whether there was anyone present from the racing industry.
Chairman Daley responded that the Secretary had informed him that there was not.
Commissioner Butler, seconded by Commissioner Goslin, moved to amend Section 54-333, such
that the fees shall be used for the purpose of the General Fund. The motion to amend carried.
Commissioner Schneider voted no.
Chairman Daley asked leave to add all Commissioners as co-sponsors, with the exception of
Commissioner Schneider.
Vice Chairman Sims, seconded by Commissioner Butler, moved that the ordinance
(Communication Number 284783) be approved and adopted, as amended. The motion carried.
Commissioner Silvestri voted present, and Commissioners Peraica and Schneider voted no.

AN AMENDMENT TO CHAPTER 32 FEES (ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL)
(PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT).
Submitting a Proposed Ordinance
Amendment sponsored by Mike Quigley, County Commissioner; Co-Sponsored by Gregg
Goslin, Roberto Maldonado and Joan Patricia Murphy, County Commissioners.
The following is a synopsis of the Proposed Ordinance Amendment:
PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT
AN AMENDMENT TO CHAPTER 32 FEES (ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL)
WHEREAS, Cook County is a home rule unit of local government pursuant to Article 7,
Section 6a of the Illinois Constitution of 1970 with power to regulate those matters which
pertain to its government and affairs; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Department of Environmental Control enforces the
Environmental Control Ordinance, which regulates air pollutants, noise, vibration, indoor
asbestos abatement, and solid waste management; and

851

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 21, 2007
WHEREAS, the Department of Environmental Control charges fees to offset the cost of
inspecting and permitting regulated activities and to encourage the prudent use of natural
resources; and
WHEREAS, the costs of operating the Department of Environmental Control and the public
health costs of air-pollution-related illnesses have grown in recent years, while the fees
charged by the Department of Environmental Control have not changed in more than a
decade; and
WHEREAS, fees for similar services charged by the City of Chicago and State of Illinois are
significantly higher than the fees currently charged by Cook County.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners
that Chapter 32 of the Cook County Code is hereby amended as follows:
Sec. 32-1. Fee Schedule.
Effective Date: This Ordinance shall take effect upon passage.
*Referred to the Committee on Finance as Amended on 02/06/07.
Commissioner Quigley delivered the following remarks: Donna Dunnings, Budget Director, submitted a
letter dated February 5, 2007 to Commissioner Goslin, which included a fee study that was completed
some time ago. The Department of Environmental Control has not increased its fees since 1973. This fee
would generate an additional $5.6 million per year. In a memorandum addressed to Chairman Daley,
Kevin Givens, the Director of the Cook County Department of Environmental Control, has released an
up-to-date adjustment. His estimate for the fiscal year 2007 is $3,353,713. For a full year it would be
closer to $4 million. This fee is long overdue and is not burdensome.
Commissioner Quigley, seconded by Commissioner Goslin, moved that the ordinance
(Communication Number 284784) be approved and adopted. The motion carried.

ORDINANCE REGARDING CHAPTER 58, ARTICLE V, SECTION 164 REGARDING
MOTOR VEHICLES, SEIZURE AND IMPOUNDMENT (PROPOSED ORDINANCE).
Submitting a Proposed Ordinance sponsored by Larry Suffredin, County Commissioner.
The following is a synopsis of the Proposed Ordinance:
PROPOSED ORDINANCE
BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that Chapter 58, Article
V, Section 164 is hereby enacted as follows:
Section 58-164. Motor Vehicles, Seizure and Impoundment.
(a) Definitions.
(b) Owner liability; exceptions.
(c) Seizure and impoundment.
(d) Vehicle impoundment hearing.
(e) Notification of impoundment; hearing scheduled; failure of owner to appear;
determination; penalty
(f) Administrative penalty constitutes debt owing to County.
Section 58-165. Qualified Violations for Impoundment.
*Referred to the Committee on Finance on 02/06/07.

Commissioner Suffredin stated that the ordinance would create an impoundment fee schedule which
would generate just under $1 million per year, based upon the number of cars that are impounded.
Commissioner Beavers inquired how this ordinance relates to the Illinois Motor Vehicle Code.
Matthew Walsh, Deputy Chief, Cook County Sheriff’s Police Department, replied that this ordinance is
consistent with Illinois law.
Commissioner Beavers inquired as to the process of impoundment.
Mr. Walsh replied that the County works with twenty-one towing companies, which charge a fee of $130
to $150. Various other municipalities charge impound fees ranging up to $500. Cook County would
have a twenty-four hour patrol desk where the individual would pay a $500 fee and obtain a receipt. The
individual would then go to the tow yard during regular business hours to retrieve the vehicle.
Commissioner Murphy asked for clarification of the term “curfew” included in the ordinance.
Commissioner Suffredin replied that this category of offense was removed from the ordinance in a
proposed amendment.
Commissioner Quigley noted that Mr. Givens had just informed him that the projected revenue for the
current year from the proposed fee increase is $1.2 million.
Commissioner Collins voiced concern that the County does not have the resources to conduct
administrative hearings for impoundment.

861

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 21, 2007
Commissioner Suffredin replied that this would be done through the existing court system, with the
County’s courtrooms, State’s Attorney personnel, with a judge presiding.
Commissioner Butler voiced concern that the ordinance does little to address the situation where an
individual is driving the car without the knowledge of the owner.
Commissioner Silvestri made the following remarks: The ordinance exempts stolen vehicles which are
reported to the police within twenty-four hours. The ordinance also exempts the situation where a
violation occurred without the knowledge of the person who controls the vehicle. There is an
impoundment hearing, at which the owner can make a case for the vehicle to be released and the fee
waived.
Mr. Walsh stated that the vehicle owner has a right, within twelve hours, to request a vehicle
impoundment hearing. If the vehicle is stolen, it will be returned to the owner-of-record immediately; no
fees will be charged and the towing fee will be waived.
Commissioner Silvestri inquired whether the ordinance gives the Sheriff’s Office the authority to waive
the fee if the vehicle owner cannot afford to pay it.
Commissioner Suffredin replied in the negative.
Vice Chairman Sims suggested that it would be economical for the County to develop the capability of inhouse towing and impounding.
Commissioner Steele urged that the County be more aggressive in obtaining profit sharing with the
towing companies, which in some cases obtain salvage title and then profit from the sale of the cars.
Commissioner Claypool echoed this sentiment.
Commissioner Suffredin, seconded by Commissioner Silvestri, moved that the ordinance
(Communication Number 284785) be approved and adopted.
PROPOSED AMENDMENT TO COMMUNICATION NUMBER 284785
Sponsored by Larry Suffredin, County Commissioner
Sec. 58-164(b), should read as follows:
The owner of record of any motor vehicle which vehicle is used during the commission
of any of that violates any of the qualified violations as set forth in Section 58-165 shall
be liable to the County for an administrative penalty of $500.00 plus any towing and
storage fees applicable under this division. Any such vehicle shall be subject to seizure
and impoundment pursuant to this division. This subsection shall not apply if:
In Sec. 58-165, Qualified Violations for Impoundment, delete the following text:

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 21, 2007

BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that Chapter 58, Article V, Section
164 is hereby enacted as follows:
Sec. 58-164. Motor Vehicles, Seizure and Impoundment.
(a) Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the
meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different
meaning:
Owner of record of a vehicle means the record title holder.
(b) Owner liability; exceptions. The owner of record of any motor vehicle which vehicle is used during
the commission of any of that violates any of the qualified violations as set forth in Section 58-165 shall
be liable to the County for an administrative penalty of $500.00 plus any towing and storage fees
applicable under this division. Any such vehicle shall be subject to seizure and impoundment pursuant to
this division. This subsection shall not apply if:
(1) The vehicle used in the violation was stolen at the time and the theft was reported to the
appropriate police authorities within 24 hours after the theft was discovered or reasonably should have
been discovered; or
(2) The vehicle is operating as a common carrier and the violation occurs without the knowledge
of the person in control of the vehicle; or

863

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 21, 2007

(c) Seizure and impoundment. Whenever the sheriff or his agent has probable cause to believe that a
vehicle is subject to a seizure and impoundment pursuant to this division, the sheriff shall provide for the
towing of the vehicle to a facility controlled by the County or its agents. Before or at the time the vehicle
is towed, the Sheriff shall notify any person identifying himself/herself as the owner of the vehicle or any
person who is found to be in control of the vehicle at the time of the alleged violation of the fact of the
seizure and of the alleged violation and of the vehicle owner's right to request a vehicle impoundment
hearing to be conducted under this section. The sheriff may issue rules and regulations related to this
Section for enforcement notification procedures and proper forms necessary for administration of this
Section.
(d) Vehicle impoundment hearing. Whenever the owner of record of a vehicle seized pursuant to this
division makes a request in person and in writing for a vehicle impoundment hearing within 12 hours
after the seizure, a hearing officer of the County shall conduct the vehicle impoundment hearing within 24
hours after the seizure excluding Sundays and legal holidays. All interested persons shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to be heard at the vehicle impoundment hearing. The formal and technical rules of
evidence shall not apply in the conduct of the hearing. Evidence, including hearsay, may be admitted only
if it is a type commonly relied upon by reasonably prudent persons in the conduct of their affairs. If, after
the hearing, the hearing officer determines that there is probable cause to believe that the vehicle is
subject to seizure and impoundment under Subsection (a), the hearing officer shall order the continued
impoundment of the vehicle as provided in this division unless the owner of the vehicle posts with the
County a cash bond in the amount of $500.00 plus any applicable towing and storage fees.
(e) Notification of impoundment; hearing scheduled; failure of owner to appear; determination;
penalty. Within ten days after a vehicle is seized and impounded pursuant to this division, the County
shall notify by certified mail, return receipt requested, the owner of record of the date, time and location
of a hearing that will be conducted pursuant to this division. The hearing shall be scheduled and held,
unless continued by order of the hearing officer, no later than 30 days after the vehicle was seized. The
hearing shall be conducted by a hearing officer of the County. All interested persons shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to be heard at the hearing. If, after the hearing, the hearing officer determines by a
preponderance of evidence that the vehicle violated this Section and that none of the exceptions described
in Subsections (b)(1)--(b)(2) of this section applies, the hearing officer shall enter an order finding the
owner of record of the vehicle civilly liable to the County for an administrative penalty in the amount of
$500.00. If the owner of record fails to appear at the hearing, the hearing officer shall enter a default order
in favor of the County requiring the payment to the County of an administrative penalty in the amount of
$500.00. If the hearing officer finds that no such violation occurred, the hearing officer shall order the
immediate return of the owner's vehicle or cash bond.
(f) Administrative penalty constitutes debt owing to County. If an administrative penalty is imposed
pursuant to this division, such penalty shall constitute a debt due and owing to the County. If a cash bond
has been posted pursuant to this division, the bond shall be applied to the penalty. If a vehicle has been
impounded when such a penalty is imposed, the County may seek to obtain judgment against the vehicle
or enforce such judgment against the vehicle as provided by law. Except as provided otherwise in this
division, a vehicle shall continue to be impounded until:

864

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 21, 2007
(1) The penalty, plus any applicable towing and storage fees, is paid to the County, in which
case possession of the vehicle shall be given to the person who is legally entitled to possess the vehicle; or
(2) The vehicle is sold or otherwise disposed of to satisfy a judgment or enforce a lien as
provided by law. If the administrative penalty and applicable fees are not paid within 30 days after an
administrative penalty is imposed under Subsection (e) of this section against an owner of record who
defaults by failing to appear at the hearing, the vehicle shall be deemed unclaimed and shall be disposed
of in the manner provided for by law for the disposition of unclaimed vehicles. In all other cases, if the
administrative penalty and applicable fees are not paid within 30 days after the expiration of time at
which administrative review of the hearing officer's determination may be sought, or within 30 days after
an action seeking administrative review has been resolved in favor of the County, whichever is
applicable, the vehicle shall be deemed unclaimed and shall be disposed of in the manner provided by law
for the disposition of unclaimed vehicles.
Except as otherwise specifically provided by law, no owner, lien holder or other person shall be legally
entitled to take possession of a vehicle impounded under this section until the civil penalty and fees
applicable under this division have been paid. However, whenever a person with a lien of record against
an impounded vehicle has commenced foreclosure proceedings, possession of the vehicle shall be given
to that person if the person agrees in writing to refund to the County the amount of the net proceeds of
any foreclosure sale, less any amounts required to pay all lien holders of record, up to $500.00 plus the
applicable fees.
Sec. 58-165. Qualified Violations for Impoundment.

Permit Required

A. It is unlawful for any person, firm, partnership, corporation or other legal entity to
use, own or lease an alarm system or to be in control of a premises wherein an alarm
system is operated or maintained without having first obtained a permit as provided
in this Chapter.
B. It is unlawful for any person, firm, partnership, corporation or other legal entity to

C. A permit must be obtained from the Department of Revenue for each separately
addressed operating location.
D. A $100.00 annual fee shall be charged to businesses within unincorporated Cook
County to obtain an alarm user permit.
E. The annual fee shall be due on January July 1st of each year or as determined by the
Department of Revenue in consultation with the Cook County Sheriff’s Police
Department.
F. For the period from the effective date of this Ordinance to the date of the first due
date for payment of the required annual permit fee subsequent to such effective date,
a permit is not required for an Alarm System installed at a Protected Premises prior
to the effective date of this Ordinance.
Sec. 54-333.

Permit Application

A. Each applicant for a permit to maintain an alarm system shall file a written
application with the Department of Revenue stating:
1. The full legal name, address, and telephone number of the applicant.
2. The name, address and telephone number of the premises where the alarm system is
located.
3. The type of alarm system at the protected premises.
Chairman Daley inquired as to the projected revenue from the proposed ordinance.
Commissioner Suffredin replied that the County can anticipate $100,000 in permit fees, but the number of
false alarms would determine the remaining amount. Last year there were 1,000 false alarms.
Commissioner Steele voiced concern that the $100 permit fee might discourage usage; he suggested a
lower fee.
Commissioner Beavers noted that one problematic situation is where the alarm goes off, the Sheriff’s
Office responds, the Sheriff’s Office determines there was no burglary, and then the homeowner or
business owner arrives the next morning to find that a burglary did occur.

869

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 21, 2007
Commissioner Suffredin replied that, as stated on page two of the ordinance, this situation is not
considered a false alarm.
Commissioner Beavers stated that several false alarms should be permitted (instead of only one) before
fees are imposed.
Commissioner Schneider inquired whether homeowners are required to buy a permit.
Commissioner Suffredin replied in the negative.
Commissioner Schneider inquired as to what municipalities charge for permits and false alarms.
Jay Rutili, Special Assistant to the Sheriff, replied that other municipalities, the Illinois Association of
Police Chiefs, and entities throughout the United States all recommend this type of ordinance. Other
municipalities charge less than $100 for a permit, but there is more travel time involved with the Sheriff’s
Police, so a higher fee is appropriate.
Commissioner Collins inquired whether a fee is involved in the case of a homeowner’s false alarm(s).
Commissioner Suffredin replied that there are not a significant number of residents in unincorporated
Cook County that would be affected. There may, however, come a time in the future when an
amendment including residents would be appropriate.
Commissioner Steele voiced concern over the protection of home-based businesses.
Commissioner Suffredin, seconded by Commissioner Silvestri, moved that the amendment to the
proposed ordinance be approved. The motion carried. Commissioner Steele voted present, and
Commissioners Butler, Goslin and Peraica voted no.

Commissioner Maldonado noted that he had circulated several amendments to the proposed ordinance.
Commissioner Suffredin inquired as to the County’s means of measurement.
Commissioner Maldonado replied that the County would be utilizing methods established by the United
States Environmental Protection Agency. The companies would have to submit a biannual report
disclosing their emission levels. He noted that two coal-fired power plants located in Chicago will
qualify; they currently emit more than 2500 tons per year in sulfur dioxide.
Commissioner Suffredin, seconded by Commissioner Butler, moved to amend the proposed
ordinance by striking Section 4. The motion to amend carried. Commissioner Goslin voted no.
Commissioner Suffredin inquired whether the administration and the Department of Revenue are
comfortable with this ordinance, in terms of collecting a fee.
Ms. Bruno replied in the affirmative. She further stated that the Department questioned whether or not it
would be considered an occupation tax, and therefore the amendment employs the term, “fee.”
Chairman Daley requested that Mr. Driscoll look into the issue of whether this ordinance is a fee or a tax.
Mr. Driscoll replied that he would have an opinion on the matter by next Thursday.
Commissioner Schneider voiced concern that the two entities which would effectively be taxed by this
ordinance were not invited to the meeting.
Chairman Daley asked the Secretary to the Board to call upon the registered public speakers.

Commissioner Maldonado stated that this ordinance would be a good way to recoup the cost of both the
undue wear these vehicles cause to the highway system, and the health and environmental damage these
vehicles cause. He further noted that gas-efficient vehicles would be exempt from the ordinance.
Commissioner Collins inquired as to how this fee would be collected.
Commissioner Maldonado replied that the flat fee would be placed on the vehicles as they are sold for
retail purchase.
Mr. Driscoll stated that he would characterize this as a tax.
Commissioner Steele stated that this fee would come as an addition to three other costs associated with
owning a SUV: increased gas consumption, increased fee for a City of Chicago vehicle sticker, and an
increased insurance rate.

Commissioner Maldonado delivered a brief overview as to why passing this Ordinance today is crucial to
the health of many citizens. The human toxicity of sulfur dioxide emissions is undeniable; it causes
widespread asthma (especially in children), as well as increased incidence of heart attacks and lung
disease. The agreement that the company currently has with the State of Illinois would take eleven-tofifteen years to fully implement. This Ordinance provides incentive for the cleanup to happen much
sooner.

COOK COUNTY SULFUR DIOXIDE EMISSION TAX
WHEREAS, sulfur dioxide is listed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as a criteria air
pollutant under the Clean Air Act, for which it sets health-based air quality standards; and
WHEREAS, sulfur dioxide gas emissions are known to cause adverse bronchial reactions, reduced lung
function, destabilized heart rhythms, and premature death; and
WHEREAS, sulfur dioxide reacts with the air upon emission to form sulfate particles, a form of fine
particulate matter, also listed as a criteria air pollutant, which is known to cause lung cancer, asthma
attacks, heart attacks, and premature death; and
WHEREAS, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has designated the Chicago region as a
nonattainment area for the fine particulate matter standard set in 1997; and
WHEREAS, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency strengthened the fine particulate standard in
September 2006, though not to the level that its own Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee stated is
necessary to protect public health; and
WHEREAS, sulfur dioxide emissions react with the air to form sulfuric acid, which falls to the earth as
acid rain and can damage forests and crops, change the makeup of soil, make lakes and streams acidic and
uninhabitable, and accelerate the decay of building materials and paints; and
WHEREAS, the Illinois Constitution, Article XI, Section 2, provides that each person has the right to a
healthful environment; and
WHEREAS, in the same way the Cook County cigarette tax discourages smoking, due to the adverse
public health and environmental effects caused by the release of sulfur dioxide into the air, such
emissions should also be discouraged; and
WHEREAS, Cook County is a home rule unit of local government pursuant to Article VII, Section 6(a)
of the 1970 Illinois Constitution; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners has determined that a County tax based upon
emissions of sulfur dioxide should be imposed upon large sources of those emissions within Cook

WHEREAS, on Monday, February 26th the many friends and loved ones of Mrs. Ruby Lee Brown will
come together to celebrate a genuine milestone, her 80th birthday; and
WHEREAS, this joyous occasion will provide an opportunity to applaud the accomplishments of one of
the genuine pillars in our community; and
WHEREAS, for more than three decades, Mrs. Brown served with distinction as a committed employee
of the Clerk of the Circuit Court of Cook County. In that capacity, Mrs. Brown put her natural “people”
skills and Southern hospitality to good use, diffusing tension and injecting a little levity into a fast-paced,
stressful environment. Mrs. Brown connected with and gained the respect of people from all walks of
life. Whether a judge, clerk or a member of the general public in desperate need of information, everyone
was treated with her signature “poised and professional” demeanor; and
WHEREAS, as a longtime friend and active supporter of the Eighth Ward Regular Democratic
Organization, and the Women’s Auxiliary, Mrs. Brown has participated in countless political functions
and rallies over the years. As a full-time clerk, mother, friend and wife, Mrs. Brown “has fulfilled God’s
mission” and her myriad contributions continue to serve as a source of inspiration and pride for others in
her community; and
WHEREAS, the quintessential “self-made” woman, Mrs. Brown worked hard all of her life and stressed
to her children the value of a strong work ethic; and
WHEREAS, Mrs. Brown’s vibrancy is clearly the result of her natural “zest for life,” as well as her
attentive ear, compassionate heart and righteous actions. Moreover, Mrs. Brown is an active member of
Christ Universal Temple and, remarkably, still drives her “money green” Cadillac each day for a vigorous
workout at her local Y.M.C.A.; and
