The reading of the minutes of the July 24, 2019, regular Board meeting was dispensed with as copies

Review of the Financial Statements.
At the conclusion of the review of the financial statements, Judy Wirsching provided the Board with a
status update on the 2018 Financial Audit. Mrs. Wirsching stated that the audit process is on track to
conclude by the filing deadline. Further, she informed the Board that they will be receiving an email
communication regarding the desire to hold a post-audit meeting. The Board members will need to
indicate whether they would like a meeting scheduled or waived. It was discussed that there has not
been a post-audit meeting in at least five years and it would be the desire of the Board to schedule one.
Mrs. Wirsching stated that she would work with the State Auditor’s office to schedule the post-audit
meeting for the September Board meeting date.
Legislative Updates – Opioid Litigation Legislation
Mr. O’Donnell provided a status report on the recent news concerning the Ohio Attorney General who
is seeking state legislation to take control of all opioid litigation in the State of Ohio. Mr. O’Donnell
expressed the opinion that such a move could be challenged on constitutional grounds both in State
courts and in Federal Courts. If challenged, the litigation challenging the takeover attempt would likely
tie up the litigation in Ohio for a number of years.
