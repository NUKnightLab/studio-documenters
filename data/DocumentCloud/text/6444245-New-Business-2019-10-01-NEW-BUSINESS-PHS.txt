JUNIOR LEAGUE OF DETROIT Dear Seminole Street Neighbor,

ASPIRE
DESIGN AND HUME - efforts in Greater Detroit.

NA MEDIA SHUNSUH



2020 AT THE BINGLEY FALES HOUSE

 

Prior to renovations starting on the home, we will be hosting our Sneak-A-Peek weekend October 11-13,
2019. This event is part of our biennial fundraiser and offers the public a ?rst glance at the selected house
before interior designers start working in their assigned space. The hours for this event are 4:00 8:00 pm.
on October 10:00 am. 4:00 pm. on October and 12:00 ?4:00 pm. on October 

Due to the excitement surrounding the opening of the decorated Show House in the Spring, we anticipate
many people in attendance during these three days. Please know that we aim to be an outstanding citizen
while in your neighborhood and apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you. We are asking for
visitors to be mindful and respectful of private property and driveways while visiting the house and we are
working with the local police precinct to pay special attention to the neighborhood during the Sneak-A?Peek
weekend.

Renovations to the kitchen and several bathrooms will begin this Fall, and next Spring approximately 30
interior designers will redesign the other rooms in the house. The Show House will then be open for Public
Tours from May 15 June 14, 2020. More information can be found at 
house.

The Junior League of Detroit is a dynamic group of women leaders who have been making change happen
since 1914. For over 100 years, we have been striving to promote voluntarism, develop the potential of
women, and improve communities through the effective action and leadership of trained volunteers. Since
1914 the Junior League of Detroit has competed 53 major projects in and around the City of Detroit and
awarded over $250,000 dollars in community grants. Our 2020 Designers? Show House will support the
League?s local philanthropic efforts, including our key community impact initiative 'Project which helps
create a more food secure community by providing Education, Access, and Tools to those in need.

We look fonivard to sharing your beautiful neighborhood and homes as we highlight the best of home design
in our great city. ASPIRE DESIGN AND HOME magazine, our national media sponsor, will also showcase
Indian Village to a national audience. Please feel free to contact us should you have any questions about
Sneak-A?Peek or the Designers? Show House. Contact Sneak-A?Peek event co?chair Jade Savage at 313-
680?0280. For all other questions related to the Designers? Show House, please email Dianne Bostic

MEMORANDUM
TO: Brenda Jones, City Council President )3 ?x "Rt
I It
FROM: Ericka Savage Whitley, Assistant Corporation Counsel&l? 
DATE: September 25, 2019 
RE: Requirements for Electrical Apprenticeships
BACKGROUND

Your Honorable Body, through Council President Brenda Jones, has requested a
memorandum on the electrical apprenticeship quali?cations for the City of Detroit. The
memorandum was requested in response to correspondence received from Attorney Duane R.
Johnson on behalf of a master electrician, Larry Gordon. Mr. Gordon established the non-pro?t
Center for Electrical Training, which places students in the International Brotherhood of Electrical
Workers apprentice program. According to Mr. Johnson, the City?s training
requirements are more stringent than the State of Michigan Licensing and Regulatory Affairs
requirements. We are now responding tO your request.

SHORT ANSWER

The Skilled Trades Regulation Act (Public Act 407 of 2016) created uniform
provisions for the application of various occupations, including electrical apprentices and electrical
journeymen. The City of Detroit has authority under the STRA to regulate the licensing,
registration, and examination requirements for those who perform the trade within the City. The
City?s registration requirements for an electrical apprentice are the same as LARA, and both
require participation in an approved training program. As it relates to licensing requirements to
become an electrical journeyman, the City?s ordinance is in compliance with the STRA. However,
administrative documents on the City?s website impose an additional requirement to have an
electrical apprentice registration on ?le with the City, which has not been adopted by ordinance,
nor a requirement under the STRA. The STRA requires the City to apply reciprocity to electrical
licenses and registrations issued by other municipalities and by the state. As such, the Law
Department has advised BSEED and the Electrical Board of Examiners to remove any language
on the City?s website, or otherwise, requiring an electrical journeyman applicant to have an
electrical apprentice application on file with the City.

LAW ANALYSIS

The Skilled Trades Regulation Act (Public Act 407 of 2016)1 consolidated
statutes for ?ve skilled trade industries2 to create one uniform code that regulates the application,
testing, and renewal processes for skilled trades licensees.

STRA Applicability to Municipalities

The STRA grants municipalities the authority to adopt an ordinance that provides standards
that are ?at least as stringent" as the STRA for the licensing and examination of master electricians,
electrical contractors, electrical journeymen, and the registration of apprentice electricians? The
state of Michigan issues electrical licenses and registrations to most residents in the state of
Michigan. However, the City of Detroit and City of Grand Rapids have adopted ordinances to
locally issue electrical licensees and registrations.4 Therefore, persons engaging in an electrical
trade or occupation within the City of Detroit must apply directly to the City for a license or
registration, and not the state.

Electrical Apprentice Registration Requirements

The STRA regulates the registration and training requirements for an electrical apprentice.
Speci?cally, MCL 339.5717, states:

(1) An individual who is employed as an apprentice electrician shall
register with the board on a form provided by the board within 30
days after employment.

(2) The department shall issue a certi?cate of registration to an
individual who is seeking registration under this section if it receives
satisfactory proof of the individual's participation in an
apprenticeship training program that is approved by the board
under subsection (4).

(3) The ratio of electrical journeymen or master electricians to
registered apprentice electricians shall be on the basis of 1

 

MCL 339.5101 et seq. Effective April 4, 2017.

2 Electrical Administrative Act (PA 217 of 1956); Forbes Mechanical Contractors Act (192 of 1984); Building
Of?cials and Inspectors Registration Act (PA 54 of 1986); State Plumbing Act (PA 733 of 2002); Boiler Act of
1965 (PA 290 of 1965).

3 MCL 

4 See the Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs Electrical Examination, Licensing/Registration 

Application Information webpage.

electrical journeyman or master electrician to no more than 3
registered apprentice electricians. . .

(4) For the purposes of this section, the board shall approve any
bona ?de apprenticeship training program that complies with
subsection (3) and, excluding any requirements related to jobsite
ratios that are inconsistent with subsection (3), is equivalent to or
exceeds the requirements of those imposed by the O?ice of
Apprenticeship in the United States Department of Labor.
(Emphasis added.)

Section of the 1984 Detroit Municipal Code states the following registration
requirements for an electrical apprentice:

1. An individual employed as an Apprentice Registration shall register
on a form provided by the Board within thirty (30) days after
employment.

2. The Buildings and Safety Engineering Department shall issue a
Certi?cate of Registration to a person seeking registration upon
satisfactory proof of the person?s participation in a bona ?de
Apprenticeship training program approved by the Board. This
program shall be equivalent to the requirements of those imposed
by the United States Labor Bureau of Apprenticeship and
(Emphasis added.)

The City?s electrical apprentice ordinance is nearly identical to the STRA. However, Mr.
Johnson?s correspondence noted an issue with the City requiring participation in a training
program to register as an electrical apprentice, stating, ?in 2010 the City of Detroit added the
following language for electrical apprentice He went on to cite language that
required electrical apprentices to participate in an electrical training program approved by the
Electrical Administrative Board. Mr. Johnson continued, ?[ojur problem is that the application
of the law by the State Licensing and Regulatory Affairs (LARA), graduation or attendance at a
recognized training or educational program is not a mandatory requirement.? Mr. Johnson then
cited the following:

Electrical Journeyman License

0 Must be at least 20 years of age.

0 Have not less than 8,000 hours of practical experience obtained over a
period of not less than 4 years related to electrical construction or
maintenance of buildings or electrical wiring or equipment under the
direct supervision of a person licensed under 2016 PA 407.

3

(Maximum credit of 2,000 hours per year.)

0 Credit may be provided for graduation from or attendance at a
recognized training or educational program.

I Must take and pass the examination. 5

The above citation intermingles the STRA requirements to become an electrical apprentice with
the requirements to become an electrical journeyman. Both the City of Detroit and the STRA
require participation in a training program to register as an electrical apprentice.? Additionally,
application for an electrical apprentice requires a Technical Instruction Provider to certify
that the applicant is ?currently participating in an electrical or fire alarm training program approved
by the Electrical Administrative Board."7 Therefore, LARA imposes the same registration
requirement as the City for an electrical apprentice to participate in an approved training program.

Electrical Journeyman License Requirements

The STRA also regulates the licensing requirements for an electrical journeyman.
Speci?cally, MCL 339.5715 states in relevant part:

(1) The department shall issue an electrical joumeyman's license to any
individual who is at least 20 years old, meets the requirements described in
article 2, and meets either of the following:

Has at least 8,000 hours of experience obtained over a period
of at least 4 years related to electrical construction or
maintenance of buildings or electrical wiring or equipment
under the direct supervision of an individual who is licensed
under this 

(Emphasis added.)

Section of the 1984 Detroit City Code states the following licensing
requirements for an electrical journeyman:

The Department shall issue an electrical ourneyman?s License to a
person not less than twenty (20) years of age who does all of the
following:

a. Files a completed application on a form provided by the
Buildings and Safety Engineering Department;

 

5 See Attorney Duane R. Johnson?s correspondence attached.
6 See MCL 339.5717(2) and 1984 Detroit Municipal Code Section 
7 See electrical apprentice registration application.

 

b. Pays the examination fee prescribed and passes an examination
provided for by the Board;

c. Pays the license fee prescribed by the Buildings and Safety
Engineering Department; and

d. Files a written statement from present or former employers to
the effect that the applicant has not less than 8,000 hours of
experience obtained over a period of not less than four (4)
years related to electrical construction or maintenance of
buildings, or electrical wiring or equipment under the direct
supervision of a Master Electrician or Journeyman Electrician
that is licensed under this Ordinance. (Emphasis added.)

The City?s electrical journeyman ordinance is nearly identical to the STRA. However, Mr.
Johnson ended his letter with the following request for relief, ?[wjhat we are asking is that
requirements for being able to obtain a journeyman electrical license be the same for the City of
Detroit as it is for the rest of the State of Michigan pursuant to the LARA guidelines.? Upon review
of the City?s ordinance and journeyman license application,8 as well as journeyman
license application,9 all are in compliance with the STRA and do not impose any additional
requirements.

However, upon review of the City?s website, the Law Department discovered
administrative documents that include an additional requirement that electrical journeyman
applicants have ?a current Electrical Apprentice Registration form on ?le in good standing.?10 Our
of?ce contacted BSEED for further explanation because nothing in the STRA, nor the City?s
ordinance, imposes this requirement.

In response to the Law Department?s inquiry, BSEED provided a copy of a notice issued
by the Michigan Department of Energy, Labor Economic Growth to all electrical
contractors and apprentice electricians in the state of Michigan. 1] The letter is not dated, but states
that it is ?effective September 1, 2010.? BSEED con?rmed that the following language was
derived from the DLEG notice and then incorporated into various administrative documents:

EFFECTIVE SEPTEMBER 1, 2010, ALL ELECTRICAL
APPRENTICES ARE REQUIRED TO BE PARTICIPATING IN
AN ELECTRICAL TRAINING PROGRAM APPROVED BY
THE ELECTRICAL ADMINISTRATIVE BOARD AS
STIPULATED IN THE STATE OF MICHIGAN SKILLED

 

8 See the City?s electrical journeyman application.

9 See electrical journeyman license application.

?0 See the City?s electrical journeyman information sheet and checklist attached.
See the 2010 DLEG notice attached.

TRADES REGULATION ACT (PA 407 of 2016). FAILURE TO
DO so INVALIDATES THE REGISTRATION. ANY HOURS
ACCUMULATED ON AN INVALID REGISTRATION WILL
NOT BE CREDITED TOWARDS THE JOURNEYMAN
ELECTRICIAN EXAMINATION. ?2

The 2010 DLEG notice also included the following language,

qualify to sit for the State of Michigan journeyman electrician
examination an electrical apprentice must attain 8000 hours of
experience and TRI in not less than 4 years working for and
employed by an electrical contractor licensed under the provisions
of PA 217 of 1956, be registered with the USDOLOA and
participating in an approved electrical apprentice training
program, and be registered with the State of Michigan Bureau of
Construction Codes for all 4 years of apprenticeship.? (Emphasis
added.)

According to BSEED, the City?s Electrical Board of Examiners interpreted 
notice to mean that only an electrical apprentice can apply to be an electrical journeyman.
The Board then updated various documents to require that applicants for an electrical journeyman
license have an electrical apprentice registration on ?le with the City and in good standing.

However, neither the Electrical Administrative Act (PA 217 of 1956),13 nor the STRA,
require an electrical apprenticeship as a prerequisite to obtaining an electrical journeyman license.
Practically speaking, registering as an electrical apprentice is how the vast majority of applicants
attain the 8,000 hours Of experience required to sit for the journeyman examination. But the law
does not specifically require that the applicant be registered as an apprentice. For example, the
City of Grand Rapids applies 2,000 hours for a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering
toward the 8,000 hours required to sit for the journeyman examination.14

As cited above, the STRA grants the City the power to adopt an ordinance to provide for
electrical licensing and registration requirements. However, the City?s ordinance currently does
not require an electrical journeyman applicant to have an electrical apprentice registration form on
?le with the City. Moreover, the STRA expressly prohibits the City from requiring that ?an
individual be licensed with, register with, or obtain the approval of the municipality or of the
municipality's licensing board to participate in an apprenticeship or training program.?15 So even

 

?2 This language is included on the Electrical Journeyman checklist, Electrical Journeyman information sheet,
Electrical Apprentice Checklist, Electrical Apprentice Information sheet, Electrical Apprentice Initial or Renewal
Registration Application.

?3 Repealed.

?4 See City of Grand Rapids Electrical oumeyperson Exam Requirements.

'5 See MCL 

 

if the City amends the ordinance to require that applicants for an electrical journeyman license
have an electrical apprentice registration on ?le, the apprenticeship does not have to be registered
in the City of Detroit. The STRA requires the City to apply reciprocity to electrical licenses and
registrations issued by other municipalities and by the state.16

Therefore, the Law Department has advised BSEED and the President of the Electrical
Board of Examiners to remove any language from the City ?s website, or otherwise, that requires
applicants for an electrical journeyman license to have an electrical apprentice registration
form on ?le with the City. The Law Department will be attending the September 2019 Electrical
Board of Examiners meeting to further discuss and advise on these matters.

CONCLUSION

The City?s registration requirements to become an electrical apprentice are not more
stringent than LARA. Both the City and LARA require an electrical apprentice to participate in
an approved training program. Mr. Johnson?s correspondence intermingled the registration
requirements to become an electrical apprentice with the licensing requirements to become an
electrical journeyman. The City?s electrical journeyman ordinance is nearly identical to the STRA.
However, in 2010, the City?s Board of Electrical Examiners added an administrative requirement
that an electrical journeyman applicant have an electrical apprentice registration form on ?le with
the City, which has not been adopted by ordinance. BSEED and the Electrical Board of Examiners
have been advised to remove the requirement. However, Mr. ohnson?s correspondence noted a
concern for Mr. Gordon?s non-pro?t organization that places students in the IBEW apprentice
program. The Law Department did not ?nd any con?icts between the City and LARA regarding
electrical apprentice training program requirements.

IMPORTANT NOTICE TO ALL ELECTRICAL CONTRACTORS AND
APPRENTICE ELECTRICIANS IN THE STATE OF MICHIGAN

Effective September 1, 2010 all electrical apprentices in the State of Michigan are required to. be
participating in an electrical training program approved by the Electrical Administrative Board
(EAB). On February 2009 the EAB approved the Bureau of Construction Codes Electrical
Division recommendation to utilize the United States Department of Labor Of?ce of
Apprenticeship (USDOLOA) for the registration of all approved electrical training programs.
Initially the two main requirements are 1.) Electrical contractors that currently employ or
anticipate the employment of electrical apprentices must register their companies with the
USDOLOA 2.) Once an employer has registered with the USDOLOA they can set up their
apprenticeship training program with the USDOLOA and register the apprentices under
their employment. Registration with the SDOLOA for electrical contractors and the
apprentices they employ is mandatory. In order to process a State of Michigan apprentice
registration or renewal the sponsoring?employerand the electrical apprentice must ?rst be
registered with the USDOLOA. You can access information regarding registering with the
USDOLOA by contacting the Michigan Apprenticeship Steering Committee inc. (MASCI) at
The MASCI website will also have a list of approved training programs
and contact information for related technical instruction (RTI) providers. Many of the
community colleges, trades organizations, and labor organizations have electrical training
programs that have been approved by the USDOLOA. It is imperative that electrical
contractors and apprentices comply with these requirements. Failure to do so will make an
apprentice ineligible to sit for the journeyman electiician examination. The electrical
contractor could also face licensing action for allowing individuals to perform electrical Wiring
under their contractor?s license that are not properly licensed or registered as required by PA 217

of 1956.

Each electrical apprentice must be participating in an academic program of not less than 576
hours of related technical instruction (RTI). Many programs approved by the USDOLOA are in
excess of the minimum 576 hours. All electrical apprentices will be required to submit
documentation as part of theirjourneyman examination application documenting a minimum of
144 hours for each academic year. A total of up to 1000 hours accrued through approved
electrical apprenticeship training programs can be credited towards the requirements to sit for the

journeyman electrician examination.

DELEG is an equal opportunity employer/program.

Auxiliary aids, services and other reasonable accommodations are available upon request to individuals with disabilities



To qualify .to sit for the State of Michigan journeyman electrician examination an electrical
apprentice must attain 8000 hours of experience and RTI in not less than 4 years working for and
employed by an electrical contractor licensed under the provisions of PA 217 of 1956, be
regiStered.-.With the USDOLOA and participating in an approved electrical apprentice training

program, and be registered with the State of l'vlichigan Bureau of Construction Codes for all 4

years of apprenticeship.

Notice to Electrical Contractors and Apprentices
Page 2

Electrical training programs may vary somewhat to re?ect the work of the. employer and/or
program sponsor however there are specific courses of that must be included in the core of
all electrical apprenticeship training programs. The minimum 376 RTI hours shall consist of 450
core hours. The core hours must be attained while the apprentice is Sponsored by an employer.
The remaining 126 hours of RTI shall consist of other course offerings that are part of an
electrical training program approved by the USDOLOA and the Electrical Administrative Board.
Course selections are to be made by the student or employer/sponsor to re?ect educational needs
of apprentices based on the student?s needs or the sponsor?s focus of work.

The purpose of the RTT is to provide appropriate classroom training to all electrical apprentices.
.. This training along with on the job expeiience will benmcabapprentices by supplying
them with the knowledge necessary to work safely in the electrical industry. In addition,
electrical apprentices will be better prepared to pass electrical licensing examinations. Further,
the overall electrical apprentice training program will make electrical apprentices more valuable
to employers who demand skilled and knowledgeable workers. The method of delivery may
vary with the RTI provider. such as modular, onuline, distance learning or a traditional classroom
setting. The RTI provider must meet the USDOLOA apprenticeship training program standards.
RTI will be quanti?able and tracked. As stipulated above the core training hours required as part
of an approved electrical apprenticeship program must be earned while the electrical apprentice

is in the 4 year electrical apprentice registration cycle.

The MASCI website will be a valuable resource for information regarding these new
requirements. If you have reviewed the information on the MASCI website and have further
questions related to electrical contractor and apprentice registration with the USDOLOA you can
contact the USDOLOA by e?mail at or by phone at (517) 377-

1746.

Electrical apprentices currently registered with the State of Michigan will receive this noti?cation
in their renewals shortly. Before returning the registration it will be necessary for both electrical
contractors that employ apprentices and electrical apprentices to register with the USDOLOA. It
can not be overstated that there are serious consequences for electrical contractors and electrical
apprentices that do not comply with the statutory requirements. This process will take the
cooperation and effort of all involved. The electrical industry and the people of the State of
Michigan will be better served for our efforts. Thanks in advance for your patience and

cooperation.
