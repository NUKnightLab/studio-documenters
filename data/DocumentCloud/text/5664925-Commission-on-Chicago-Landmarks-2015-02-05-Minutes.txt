The following projects were reviewed by the PRC:
1. 520 S. Michigan
2nd Ward
Historic Michigan Boulevard District
Renewal of previous approval for new 1-story roof-top addition along Michigan
Avenue and 5-story rear addition along Harrison Street on the 14-story south tower of
the hotel.
Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:

1. The one-story roof-top addition, proposed to be setback 16’ from the outside
edge of the parapet on all sides (14’ from the inside edge), is approved as
submitted, with a maximum height of 9’-6” above the top of the historic
parapet (excluding the elevator penthouse extension as proposed);
2. The proposed 4’ high metal and glass railings are approved as submitted. No
additional railings visible from Michigan Avenue shall be installed on the
existing or new roof-tops; and,
3. Any exterior lighting for the roof-top addition should be minimized and shall
be reviewed and approved by Landmarks staff prior to order and installation.
A mock-up may be required as part of this review.
2. Madison/Wabash CTA Station
42nd Ward
Jewelers Row District
Proposed demolition of the existing Madison/Wabash CTA Station and construction
of the Washington/Wabash replacement station.

 Action:

The Committee voted 2-1 (with Commissioner Wong voting against the
motion) to postpone consideration of the proposal until their March 5,
2015 meeting. The revised submission should address the following
concerns discussed at the meeting:
• Investigation into the feasibility of retaining historic ornamentation of
the station.
• Discussion with preservation advocacy groups to allow them the
opportunity to assist in the effort to preserve historic ornamentation.

3. 1937 W. Evergreen
1st Ward
Wicker Park District
Proposed masonry repairs including re-parging of front façade and removal of front
staircase to an existing single-family residence.
Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:

1. The common brick front façade may be re-parged with red-colored lime-based
plaster and black-beaded joints, to match the historic evidence of this
treatment on the subject property and as proposed per Restoration by Marion
report dated 11/24/14. Material specifications shall be included in the permit
plans and the 2’ x 2’ mock-up shall be reviewed and approved by Historic
Preservation staff as part of the sample approval process prior to the execution
of the entire facade;
2. The historic main entry of the house is on the 2nd-floor and so removing the
front stair feature completely would be an adverse effect and would not meet
Standard 2. The plans shall be revised to retain the front stair to preserve this
important entry sequence. To meet code requirements, the non-historic wood
railings may be replaced with new code-compliant railing system with newel
posts at the top and base of the stair. Alternatively, to address the owner’s
concern regarding a more comfortable climb, the stair may be rebuilt as a
straight-run stair but using more gracious tread and riser dimensions. The
replacement stair may be open underneath to allow for improved visibility of
the at-grade entry. Elevations and details of the new stair and railing shall be
submitted with the permit plans;
3. The entry door at grade may be increased in height as proposed but the arched
brick lintel shall be reinstalled to match the historic lintel at this opening; and,
4. Cut-sheets of the proposed new doors shall be included in the permit plans.
4. 2043-57 W. Pierce
1st Ward
Wicker Park District
Proposed replacement of 501 windows for two 4-story multi-unit residential buildings
with new aluminum windows.
Action:

Approved unanimously as submitted.
