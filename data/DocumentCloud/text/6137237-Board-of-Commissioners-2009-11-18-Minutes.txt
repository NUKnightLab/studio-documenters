PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT
ASSESSMENT CLASS 8B DESIGNATION
BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that Chapter 74 Taxation, Section 7470 of the Cook County Code is hereby amended as follows:
Sec. 74-70.

Class 8a and 8b Designation / Assessment Class

(a) Class 8a. Real estate that is used primarily for industrial or commercial purposes, which real
estate would qualify for a Class 8 designation pursuant to Sections 74-62 through 74-64, except for the
fact that the qualifying use of the property prior to application for the incentive does not comply with the
definition of abandoned property provided for in Section 74-62(b), can receive a designation as a Class 8a
property so long as the applicant can show that it has complied with all of the requirements necessary to
receive a Class 8 designation per Sections 74-62 through 74-64, except for meeting the definition of
abandonment provided for in Section 74-62(b), but only when the Cook County Board of Commissioners
provides a resolution or ordinance in support of such designation absent abandonment.
(1)

The Cook County Board of Commissioners may only provide such a resolution or
ordinance in support of Class 8a designation absent abandonment when:
a.

An applicant who collects or transmits sales tax has obtained from the
municipality in which the real estate is located or the Cook County Board of
Commissioners, if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, an
agreement to abate a portion of the local government's sales tax generated by the
industrial or commercial enterprise located on such real estate and such
abatement of sales tax must cover the period of time for which the applicant
would qualify for this Class 8a incentive; and

3359

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 18, 2009

(2)

(3)

b.

Applicant can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Cook County Board of
Commissioners that due to national and regional economic conditions beyond its
control the industrial or commercial enterprise has undergone a significant
reduction in net operating income of at least 40 percent in the year it makes
application for this incentive as compared to the average net operating income of
the industrial or commercial enterprise in the prior three years; and

c.

Applicant provides objective and credible evidence including, but not limited to,
an economic impact study that demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Cook
County Board of Commissioners that the ongoing industrial or commercial
enterprise is not economically viable and as such it will cease operations within
60 days of the submission of an eligibility application for Class 8a designation to
the Cook County Assessor, and thereafter the property will become vacant and
unused for an extended period of time of at least 24 months; and

d.

Applicant provides objective and credible evidence including, but not limited to,
an economic impact study that demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Cook
County Board of Commissioners that designation as a class 8a property will
allow the industrial or commercial enterprise to be economically viable and
thereby continue its operations so that the industrial or commercial enterprise can
continue to occupy and fully utilize the real estate for an extended period of time.

Such a resolution or ordinance must contain:
a.

A finding that the Cook County Board of Commissioners has determined that
industrial or commercial enterprise has undergone a significant reduction in net
operating income of at least 40 percent in the year it makes application for the
incentive as compared to the average net operating income of the industrial or
commercial enterprise in the prior three years; and

b.

A finding that the Cook County Board of Commissioners has determined that
Class 8a designation of the property is necessary for the ongoing industrial or
commercial enterprise to continue its operations and that without such
designation the industrial or commercial enterprise would not be economically
viable causing the property to become vacant and unused; and

c.

A statement by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that it supports and
consents to the designation of the property as a Class 8a property absent an
abandonment requirement; and

d.

A statement by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that it supports and
consents to the application made to the Cook County Assessor requesting
designation as a Class 8a property absent an abandonment requirement.

When the real estate is located in an incorporated area of the county, and designation as a
class 8a property is sought using the provisions of this section, the municipality in which
the real estate is located must provide to the Cook County Assessor a resolution or
ordinance that contains the following:

3360

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 18, 2009

(4)

a.

A finding by the municipality that it has determined that class 8a designation of
the property is necessary for the ongoing industrial or commercial enterprise to
continue its operations and that without such designation the industrial or
commercial enterprise would not be economically viable causing the property to
become vacant and unused; and

b.

A statement by the municipality that it supports and consents to the action by the
Cook County Board of Commissioners to support designation of the property as a
Class 8a property; and

c.

A statement by the municipality that it supports and consents to the class 8a
application to the Cook County Assessor; and

Real estate receiving a Class 8a designation pursuant to the provisions of this section
shall be assessed at the lowest percentage of market value provided for in Section 7464(11), however the term of the incentive will be limited to five years only and such
Class 8a designation shall not be renewed:
a.

After the initial application has been approved and granted, if the subject real
estate receiving the Class 8a designation pursuant to the provisions of this section
is sold or the applicant transfers ownership of any portion of the property at any
time prior to the five-year term of the 8a classification, then the property's Class
8a classification shall be subject to an eligibility review by the Cook County
Board of Commissioners, the municipality, and the Assessor under the
procedures set forth in this Ordinance for the remainder of the five-year term.

(5)

In order for real estate to qualify for a Class 8a designation an eligibility application must
be made to the Cook County Assessor.

(6)

Class 8a designation can not be applied to real estate unless the following has occurred:
application is made to the Cook County Assessor; all required municipal and county
ordinances and resolutions are provided to the Cook County Assessor; and the Cook
County Assessor determines that the real estate which is the subject of the application for
a Class 8a designation would qualify for designation as a Class 8 property but for the
inability to comply with the definition of abandonment pursuant to Section 74-62(b).

(7)

The Cook County Assessor may adopt rules consistent with this section to determine
eligibility for the benefits provided under Class 8a.

(8)

Upon receipt of an eligibility application for a Class 8a designation, the Cook County
Assessor shall forward such application and any supporting documentation provided with
such application to the Cook County Board of Commissioners or its designee for
consideration as to whether the County Board will provide a resolution or ordinance in
support of a Class 8a designation absent abandonment.

Assessor shall not designate any real estate as Class 8a property for assessment year 2018
or thereafter.

designation and the corresponding reduced level of assessment, if the industrial or
commercial enterprise located on the property ceases operations and the subject real
estate becomes vacant and unused.

(13)

Real estate that receives a designation as a Class 8a incentive property will lose such
designation and the corresponding reduced level of assessment upon termination of the

become effective upon passage.

Class 8b. Real estate and improvements that house inpatient and outpatient hospital
(b)
based services, where the property has been acquired for hospital use by a for-profit acquirer unrelated to
the not-for-profit disposer, thereby avoiding Illinois Health Facilities and Services Review Board

section and the Cook County Board of Commissioners provides a resolution or ordinance in support of
such designation.
(1)

The Cook County Board of Commissioners may only provide such a resolution or
ordinance in support of class 8b designation when:
a.

the applicant is a hospital, as defined in the Hospital Licensing Act, or an entity
that owns the real property on which a hospital is located, the hospital is licensed
by the state, and the abandonment of the hospital would require the applicant, or
the hospital on behalf of which the applicant owns the real property on which the
hospital is located, to obtain a permit or exemption from the State of Illinois
Health Facilities and Services Review Board pursuant to the Illinois Health
Facilities Planning Act prior to discontinuing hospital operations and to obtain a
second permit or exemption prior to re-opening or otherwise re-establishing the
hospital after abandonment;

b.

the applicant demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Cook County Assessor that
approval of the class 8b designation will materially increase the likelihood that
the property will be retained for hospital use with the associated employment
benefits relative to industrial or commercial use of the property;

c.

the subject hospital is located in a zip code which has a 10 percent or greater
incidence of families and/or individuals below the poverty level, as identified by

3362

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 18, 2009
d.

(2)

(3)

(4)

the subject hospital employs at least 750 full-time equivalents (full-time
equivalent jobs being defined as total hours worked by all non full-time
employees divided by average annual hours worked by the full-time employees).

Such a resolution or ordinance must contain:
a.

a finding that the Cook County Board of Commissioners has determined that the
applicant demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Cook County Assessor that
approval of the class 8b designation will materially increase the likelihood that
the property will be retained for hospital use; and

b.

a statement by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that it supports and
consents to the designation of the property as a class 8b property.

When the real estate is located in an incorporated area of the county, and designation as a
class 8b property is sought using the provisions of this section, the municipality in which
the real estate is located must provide to the Cook County Assessor a resolution or
ordinance that contains the following:
a.

a finding by the corporate authorities of the municipality that the proposed
redevelopment contemplated for the subject hospital or the property on which the
hospital sits is necessary and appropriate and that, without a classification having
the impact of this section, the special circumstances that exist on the property on
which the subject hospital sits including but not limited to the unique requirement
that mandates that the subject hospital's operations are continually maintained
without interruption in order for the State of Illinois Health Facilities and
Services Review Board to issue a certificate of need and licensure approval for
the continued operation of the subject hospital and the extraordinary need for the
continued operation of the subject hospital within the applicable region, will not
be addressed and the property on which the subject hospital sits will become
vacant and underutilized and cause the continued exasperation of blighted factors
within the municipality and region;

b.

a finding by the corporate authorities of the municipality that a classification
having the impact of this section is necessary for the redevelopment to occur on
the property on which the subject hospital sits; and

c.

a statement by the corporate authorities of the municipality supporting and
consenting to the filing of an application for a classification having the impact of
this section for the property on which the subject hospital sits.

Real estate receiving a class 8b designation pursuant to the provisions of this section shall
be assessed at the lowest percentage of market value and for the term provided for in
Section 74-64 (11).

3363

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 18, 2009
(5)

In order for real estate to qualify for a class 8b designation, a class 8 or class 8b
application must be made or have been made to the Cook County Assessor. Any
application for class 8 submitted with required municipal approval after July 1, 2008 for
hospital property where the property was acquired for hospital use by an unrelated forprofit acquirer, avoiding the Health Facilities and Services Review Board discontinuation
approval, shall be reconsidered as an application pursuant to this section upon
supplement of such class 8 application with the additional information required in this
section, if any. Upon receipt of an application, the Cook County Assessor shall forward
such application and any supporting documentation provided with the application to the
Cook County Board of Commissioners for consideration as to whether the Cook County
Board will provide a resolution or ordinance in support of a class 8b designation. Real
estate receiving a class 8b designation pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be
eligible for such designation beginning in the assessment year during which an
application for the classification having the impact of this section is made to the Cook
County Assessor.

(6)

Class 8b designation cannot be applied to real estate unless the following has occurred:
application is made or has been made to the Cook County Assessor, and all required
municipal and county ordinances and resolutions are provided to the Cook County
Assessor.

Effective date. This Amended Ordinance shall take effect immediately upon adoption.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 18, 2009
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, Cook County is a home rule unit of local government pursuant to Article VII Section 6(a)
of the 1970 Illinois Constitution, and as such may exercise any power and perform any function
pertaining to its government and affairs; and
WHEREAS, the current income tax system in Illinois is not fair to those who make $20,000 a year or
less and who pay a greater percentage of their income to taxes than those who make over $20,000 and
those who make $50,000 pay a greater portion of their income than those who make $75,000 a year and
as the income increases the percentage of income paid to taxes decreases in Illinois; and
WHEREAS, if the Illinois General Assembly is going to increase income taxes it affords an opportunity
to correct the equity problem among different income brackets; and
WHEREAS, the State of Illinois has abdicated its constitutional and legislative responsibilities to fund
education at 51 percent of the cost; and
WHEREAS, the over reliance on property taxes to fund education poses undue hardship on property
owners and especially those seniors who have to rely on a fixed income; and
WHEREAS, income tax coupled with a reduction of property taxes for education would be a more
reliable way to fund education.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and the Cook County Board of
Commissioners call upon the Governor, and the leaders of the House and Senate to seriously consider
revising the income tax structure to ensure that everyone pays their fair share of income tax; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a suitable copy of this Resolution be tendered to the Governor of
Illinois and the members of the Illinois General Assembly.
_________________________
Commissioner Collins, seconded by Commissioner Beavers, moved to amend the Proposed Resolution by
inserting the words “and to lighten the burden of funding education on property owners” after the words
“income tax” at the end of the now, therefore, be it resolved clause. The motion carried unanimously.
Commissioner Collins, seconded by Commissioner Beavers, moved that the Proposed Resolution be
approved and adopted, as amended. Commissioner Beavers called for a Roll Call, the vote of yeas and
nays being as follows:

worked long hours in factories and small grocery stores in the face of economic exploitation and
discrimination; and

SEEKING FOUR (4) CONDITIONS TO BE INCLUDED IN THE COUNTY’S FISCAL

RESOLUTION). Submitting a Proposed Resolution sponsored by Jerry Butler, President

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
A RESOLUTION providing for the approval of the
2010 Preliminary Budget of the Cook County Health &
Hospitals System
WHEREAS, on June 3, 2008, the Cook County Board of Commissioners approved an
Ordinance establishing the Cook County Health & Hospital’s System (“Enabling
Ordinance”); and
WHEREAS, Section 38-83 of the Enabling Ordinance provides the following with regard to
the County Board’s approval of the System’s Preliminary Budget:
a. That the System Board shall recommend and submit a Preliminary Budget for the
System to the President of the Cook County Board of Commissioners and the
County Board, for approval by the County Board, not later than forty-five (45)
days prior to the first date for submission of budget requests by the County’s
Budget Director; and
b. That the County Board shall approve or reject each Preliminary Budget within
forty-five (45) days of submission to the County Board or such Preliminary
Budget is deemed approved; and
c. That the Preliminary Budget shall be included in the President’s Executive
Budget Recommendation; and
WHEREAS, Section 38-83 of the Enabling Ordinance further provides that after approval of
each Annual Appropriation Ordinance, the System Board has the authority to make intra-fund
transfers within the Health Fund, if necessary, to accommodate any proposed revisions by the
System Board to the line items set forth in the Annual Appropriation Ordinance; and
WHEREAS, in previous years, the County’s Resolution and Annual Appropriation Bill
contained language providing that all funds appropriated to any account or sub-account
within Category 100 (Personal Services) shall remain fixed and restricted to that category for
which they were originally appropriated, and shall not be subject to transfer to any
impersonal account, or to any line item other than those within the 100 Series, as listed in the
Chart of Accounts; and
WHEREAS, consistent with the spirit and intent of the powers and authority granted to the
System Board by the County Board in the Enabling Ordinance, the System wishes to adopt an
enterprise fund model which would allow the System Board through the System’s Chief
Executive Officer to have authority (within the confines of the total budget appropriation
adopted by the County Board) over the expenditure of funds allocated to the System by the
County Board, notwithstanding any limitations on funds appropriated to the 100 accounts in
the County’s Resolution and Annual Appropriation Bill; and
3445

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 18, 2009
WHEREAS, both the System Board (on July 16, 2009) and the County Board (on July 21,
2009) approved a Master Lease Agreement for the System which authorizes the System to
lease capital equipment through an operating lease as opposed to acquisition through
financing by a bond issuance by the County; and
WHEREAS, the System wishes to acquire capital equipment for 2010 through this Master
Lease Agreement, and inasmuch as this action may occur prior to the issuance of a bond by
the County, the System wishes to be exempt from any temporary “budget holds” that might
occur at the County level pending discussion and approval of bond issuance for certain
purchases of capital equipment; and
WHEREAS, the System receives funds from various granting agencies which funds are
already accounted for in the System’s proposed Preliminary Budget and the System wishes to
have authority to approve and receive these grant funds without having to return to the
County Board for such approval; and
WHEREAS, on August 26, 2009, the Cook County Health & Hospitals System Board of
Directors approved the System’s Fiscal Year 2010 Preliminary Budget.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Preliminary Budget for Fiscal Year
2010 of the Cook County Health & Hospitals System is approved; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the following conditions will be provided for in the
County’s Resolution and Annual Appropriation Bill for Fiscal Year 2010:
1. The System Board’s authority to make intra-fund transfers within the Health
Fund will include the ability to transfer funds in and out of Category 100
(Personal Services), notwithstanding any limitations on funds appropriated to the
100 accounts in the County’s Resolution and Annual Appropriation Bill for
Fiscal Year 2010; and
2. The System Board is authorized to acquire capital equipment for Fiscal Year
2010 through the Master Lease Agreement notwithstanding any “budget holds”
that might occur at the County level pending discussion and approval of bond
issuance for certain purchases of capital equipment; and
3. The System Board is authorized to approve and receive grant funds which are
already appropriated by the County’s Resolution and Annual Appropriation Bill
for Fiscal Year 2010 without seeking additional County Board approval,
notwithstanding any limitations on this authority in the County’s Resolution and
Annual Appropriation Bill for Fiscal Year 2010.
4. In its quarterly reports to the County Board, the System shall include reports on
intra-fund transfers within the Health Fund; expenditures approved under the
Master Lease Agreement during a ‘budget hold’; and, the System Board’s
approval and receipt of any grant funds, during the preceding quarter.
* Referred to the Committee on Finance on 09/16/09.

WHEREAS, both the System Board (on July 16, 2009) and the County Board (on July 21, 2009)

the County; and
WHEREAS, the System wishes to acquire capital equipment for 2010 through this Master Lease
Agreement, and inasmuch as this action may occur prior to the issuance of a bond by the County, the
System wishes to be exempt from any temporary “budget holds” that might occur at the County level
pending discussion and approval of bond issuance for certain purchases of capital equipment; and
WHEREAS, the System receives funds from various granting agencies which funds are already
accounted for in the System’s proposed Preliminary Budget and the System wishes to have authority to
approve and receive these grant funds without having to return to the County Board for such approval;
and
WHEREAS, on August 26, 2009, the Cook County Health & Hospitals System Board of Directors
approved the System’s Fiscal Year 2010 Preliminary Budget.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Preliminary Budget for Fiscal Year 2010 of the
Cook County Health & Hospitals System is approved; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the following conditions will be provided for in the County’s
Resolution and Annual Appropriation Bill for Fiscal Year 2010:
1.

The System Board’s authority to make intra-fund transfers within the Health Fund will
include the ability to transfer funds in and out of Category 100 (Personal Services),
notwithstanding any limitations on funds appropriated to the 100 accounts in the
County’s Resolution and Annual Appropriation Bill for Fiscal Year 2010; and

2.

The System Board is authorized to acquire capital equipment for Fiscal Year 2010
through the Master Lease Agreement notwithstanding any “budget holds” that might
occur at the County level pending discussion and approval of bond issuance for certain
purchases of capital equipment; and

3.

The System Board is authorized to approve and receive grant funds which are already
appropriated by the County’s Resolution and Annual Appropriation Bill for Fiscal Year
2010 without seeking additional County Board approval, notwithstanding any limitations
on this authority in the County’s Resolution and Annual Appropriation Bill for Fiscal
Year 2010.

Your Committee on Construction of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County met pursuant to notice

Building, 118 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois.
Your Committee has considered the following item and upon adoption of this report, the recommendation
is as follows:
303347

OFFICE OF CAPITAL PLANNING AND POLICY, by Bruce Washington, Director,
transmitting a Communication, dated October 21, 2009:
The Office of Capital Planning and Policy is requesting authorization to proceed with the
redevelopment of the historic Cook County Hospital Main Building for administrative offices
for the Cook County Health & Hospitals System.
On May 5, 2009 the Board of Commissioners approved a contract with Jones Lang LaSalle
Americas, Inc. (JLL) to perform preliminary analysis and planning for the adaptive reuse of
the historic Cook County Hospital Main Building. JLL analyzed the market and financial
feasibility of office, hotel, dormitory, rental housing, condominium housing, senior housing
and educational uses, and concluded that the most affordable and lowest risk reuse option is
to renovate the building for administrative office use by the Cook County Health & Hospitals
System to replace 1900 West Polk, which is scheduled for demolition.
The estimated cost of renovation for office use is $107,700,000.00. The Office of Capital
Planning and Policy will seek Tax Increment Financing (TIF) funds from the City of Chicago
to assist with the costs of renovation. Due to the building's status as "threatened" on the
Landmarks Illinois Watch List, we anticipate that substantial funds should be available.
The Office of Capital Planning and Policy requests permission to present the Cook County
Hospital Adaptive Reuse Study prepared by JLL to the Board of Commissioners.
*Referred to the Committee on Construction on 11-04-09.

Your Committee on Information Technology & Automation of the Board of Commissioners of Cook
County met pursuant to notice on Tuesday, November 17, 2009 at the hour of 10:00 A.M. in the Board
Room, Room 569, County Building, 118 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois.
Your Committee has considered the following item and, upon adoption of this report, the
recommendations are as follows:
303349

RECORDER OF DEEDS, Eugene “Gene” Moore, transmitting a Communication, dated
September 30, 2009:
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with Fidlar
Technologies, Inc., Rock Island, Illinois, for the property Fraud Alert system, the Disaster
Recovery System and the Tapestry/Laredo Data Sales program. The Property Fraud Alert
system will serve as an early notification for Cook County property owners, allowing them to
intervene in the event of fraudulent transactions. The Disaster Recovery System will allow
the office to resume operating within hours of any interruption of service, whether natural or
otherwise. The Tapestry/Laredo Data Sales program is expected to increase revenue from the
sale of Recorder of Deeds information beyond the current levels.
Reason:

Fidlar Technologies, Inc. provides the industry's only proactive land fraud
notification system that functions in harmony with third party recording systems.
The system requires no additional modifications to existing Recorder of Deeds
operation. The Fidlar Disaster Recovery system feeds the Tapestry/Laredo Data
Sales program with recorded information, which provides an additional level of
network security for the Recorder of Deeds office.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $322,000.00 (FY 2009: $131,613.00; and FY 2010: $190,387.00).
Contract period: November 1, 2009 through October 31, 2010. (527-260 Account).
Requisition No. 95270035.
Sufficient funds are available in the Recorder of Deeds Document Storage Fund.
The Purchasing Agent concurs.
Vendor has met the Minority and Women Business Enterprise Ordinance.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 18, 2009
At Chairman Beavers’ request, Antonio Hylton, Chief Information Officer, Bureau of Technology,
delivered a brief overview of the Item. He stated that there has been some debate as to whether this Item,
a Disaster Recovery System, is part of a larger, more comprehensive, County-wide item that will be in
front of the County Board during the upcoming Finance hearings. Mr. Hylton requested that the
Committee reserve action on this Item until this is determined. He further stated that he has several
problems with the Item currently, and that he would like to be able to vet the Item against the larger-scale,
County-wide, disaster recovery capability.
Chairman Daley inquired whether Mr. Hylton concurs at all with this Item.
Mr. Hylton replied in the negative.
Commissioner Peraica inquired whether this Item is a disaster recovery system or, rather, an early
notification system to those whom the Recorders Office employees feel may be subject to mortgage fraud.
Mr. Hylton replied that he believes the item is a combination of both.
Commissioner Peraica inquired whether Mr. Hylton has road tested this program and whether he knows
the capabilities of this program.
Mr. Hylton replied in the negative, and stated that this is why he is not in concurrence with this Item.
Commissioner Daley, seconded by Vice Chairman Gorman, moved to defer Communication No.
303349. The motion carried unanimously.
Chairman Beavers asked the Secretary to the Board to call upon the registered public speaker, in
accordance with Cook County Code, Sec. 2-108(dd):

MATTHEW B. DeLEON, Secretary to the Board of Commissioners
requesting approval of payment in the amount of $29,456.00 to AWL Reporting Services, Chicago,
Illinois, for transcribing services for the Board of Commissioners of Cook County.
Reason:

On November 18, 2008, the Board of Commissioners approved Metro Court Reporting
Services, Wheaton, Illinois, to provide transcription services for the Board of Commissioners
of Cook County. Prior to the start of the FY 2010 budget process, Metro Reporting Services
notified the Secretary to the Board that it would no longer provide these services and the
County canceled the contract.
AWL Court Reporting Services was chosen to replace Metro through the balance of FY 2009
due to their institutional knowledge of County Board proceedings, their expertise with the
County Budget process and their ability to meet accelerated turnaround times.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $29,456.00. (018 - 268 Account).

TRANSFER OF FUNDS
Transmitting a Communication, dated November 12, 2009 from
MATTHEW B. DeLEON, Secretary to the Board
requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners to transfer funds totaling $27,215.00 from and to the
accounts listed below, for the purpose of creating a 579 Computer Equipment for the Board of
Commissioners account and to meet various needs for our offices by the end of the fiscal year.
Reason:

When the procedures and policies were implemented relative to the Countywide contracts for
hardware and software technology, the Board of Commissioners did not have a 579 Account
within its budget for the purpose of replacing worn or outdated equipment. The transfers
listed below will allow those offices which have identified funds available for transfer to
access Countywide contract pricing for the hardware and software contracts.
An additional transfer is requested to provide funds for the Office of the Secretary which will
cover certain costs related to the seating of two new members of the Board during the current
term.

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
It became apparent that the receiving accounts would need an infusion of funds on August 13,
2009. The account balance on that date was $123,195.00, and was the same 30 days before that.

2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
The 695 - DHSEM Reserve Fund Balance was identified as a funding source because it is the
respective department by which all DHSEM grant reimbursements and credits from prior fiscal
years have been held.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from:
None.

4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
The 695 - DHSEM Reserve Fund Balance is the respective department by which all DHSEM grant
reimbursements and credits from prior fiscal years have been held; there are no items budgeted to
its respective accounts and is solely used to accept and hold all grant reimbursements and credits
from government municipalities (local, state, federal) for DHSEM.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.

available due to the Department not in need of renting equipment.

3.

delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from 500-630.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.

Highways, with the increasing repair cost the account was depleted. Heavy equipment has not been
purchased since Fiscal Year 2004.

OFFICE OF THE MEDICAL EXAMINER
TRANSFER OF FUNDS
Transmitting a Communication, dated October 22, 2009 from
NANCY L. JONES, M.D., Chief Medical Examiner, Office of the Medical Examiner
requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners to transfer funds totaling $34,000.00 from and to the
accounts listed below, for the purchase of goods and materials for the Office of the Medical Examiner.
Reason:

These requests are presented in order to obtain sufficient funding for the contracts continuing
into FY 2010 that are listed under the Contractual Maintenance Services and Office Supplies
accounts. Specifically, the Dayspring Janitorial Services contract would require
$238,298.00 to cover FY 2010 expenses on this 2-year contract. Therefore, with only
$250,000.00 requested for this account 259-235, which also covers exterminating,
landscaping, and snow/ice removal services, the Office intends to encumber remaining funds
to use in FY 2010. Similarly, the office supply account is also an account which is
underfunded. With a request of $35,000.00 for FY 2010, we hope to encumber some funds
on the Countywide Office Depot contract to use in FY 2010 to offset the potential shortfall
that we may have once the FY 2010 budget for 259-350 is finalized and approved. These
fund transfers will helps us substantially as we maintain the operations of the Office of the
Medical Examiner.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
The amount of purchases from the 260 - Professional and Managerial Services Account fluctuates
from year to year. However, due to this surplus we have adjusted the FY2010 request to reflect this
account's decreased spending.
The amount of purchases from the 355 - Photographic and Reproduction Supplies fluctuates from
year to year. Additionally, since this department has gone digital (eliminating film and processing
charges), the costs incurred by this department have also decreased. Due to this surplus, we have
adjusted our FY2010 request to reflect this account's decreased spending.
The amount of purchases from the 388 - Computer Operations Supplies fluctuates from year to
year. Given that the volume of cases will change from year to year, our need for these supplies will
vary. Additionally, with the number of employees utilizing computers this will also cause a
variation in the costs incurred. However, due to this surplus we have adjusted the FY2010 request
to reflect this account's decreased spending.
The amount of purchases from the 630 - Rental of Office Equipment Account fluctuates from year
to year based on the equipment rented by the department. Due to this surplus, we have adjusted our

ABISHI C. CUNNINGHAM, JR., Public Defender
requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners to transfer funds totaling $165,000.00 from and to
the accounts listed below, to cover expenditures we anticipate during the last two months of the fiscal
year.
Reason:

The Chief Financial Officer and her Accounts Payable team completed an analysis of each of
the non-personnel line items. In addition to the financial system, all of the invoices on hand
were reviewed and tallied so that they could assess where they were with respect to the funds
left in the accounts and how much additional funding would be needed or could be

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations?
On October 7th a thorough review was made of each of the non-personnel line items.

3498

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 18, 2009
What was the balance in the account on that date, and what was the balance 30 days prior to that
date?
Transportation and Other Travel Expenses for Employees: The balance was $96,592.00. The
invoices not sent to the comptroller's office totaled approximately $25,000.00. It was estimated this
account needed another $10,000.00. The balance in this account September 7th was $53,912.00
(during October an error by the comptroller's department was corrected which increased the balance
approximately $38,000.00 and the last transfer of funds added $23,000.00 to this account).
Expert Witnesses: The balance was $263,350.00. Invoices not sent to the comptroller's office were
in excess of $120,000.00. This account typically sees a lot of activity at year-end when expert's
start sending in invoices. It was estimated an additional $65,000.00 was needed in this account.
The balance September 7th was $363,778.00.
Court Reporting, Stenographic, Transcribing, or Interpreter Services: The balance was
$142,902.00. Invoices not sent to the comptroller's office totaled $139,683.00. It was estimated
another $69,000.00 was needed to meet year-end. The balance in the account September 7th was
$12,377.00 before the addition of $143,000.00 from the last transfer of funds.
Office Supplies: The balance was $1,240.00. It was estimated this account required an additional
$5,000.00 to cover invoices not at the comptroller's office. The balance September 7th was
$19,666.00.
Computer Operation Supplies: The balance was $5,167.00. It was necessary to order supplies that
totaled $8,000.00. It was estimated this account needed $10,000.00 added to cover the order and
any other last minute needs. The balance September 7th was $9,917.00.
Maintenance and Repair of Automotive Equipment: The balance was $499.00. There are a couple
of invoices that had not been sent over to the comptroller's office. It was estimated that this account
needed an additional $5,000.00 to cover the outstanding invoice and any other items that may
occur. The balance September 7th was $184.00 (before account was increased $3,000.00 with the
last transfer of funds).
Rental Facilities: The balance was $5,007.00. We are experiencing a system problem affecting the
balance remaining in the account and are concerned if it does not get fixed we will need to pay a
month or two of invoices between FY2009 and FY2010 with a payment only request and therefore,
we need to add $5,000.00 to this account. The balance on September 7th was $5,007.00.
2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? The accounts were
identified in the analysis completed on October 7th.
List any other accounts that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred
funds. No other accounts were considered.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from.
None.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
Maintenance & Repair of Data Processing Equipment & Software: The previous administration
planned for a county wide contract that was also planned elsewhere.
Books, Periodicals, Publications, Archives and Data Services: The office has received several
checks for an overpayment in 2008 totaling $14,000.00.
Professional and Managerial Services: The previous administration planned to use a consultant for
our Legal Edge activities however it has since been decided there isn't a need for additional
spending over the 2008 PO. The consultant will be used in 2010 and sufficient funds have been
budgeted for this.
The amounts from Photography and Reproduction Supplies; Rental of Office Equipment, and
Operations of Auto Equipment are fairly minimal.

OFFICE OF THE RECORDER OF DEEDS
TRANSFER OF FUNDS
Transmitting a Communication, dated October 2, 2009 from
EUGENE “GENE” MOORE, Recorder of Deeds
requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners to transfer funds totaling $716.00 from Account 130630, Rental of Office Equipment to Account 130-388, Computer Operation Supplies for a negative
balance.
Reason:

Transfer of Funds is needed to cover a negative balance in the 130-388 Computer Operation
Supplies Account because the Recorder of Deeds Technology department needed computers,
printers and workstations.

3507

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 18, 2009
From Account 130-630:

Total

$716.00

To Account 130-388:

Total

$716.00

1.

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
It was apparent that the receiving account 130-388 would require a transfer of funds in order to
meet current obligations on August 1, 2009. The balance in this account was a negative amount of
$716.00 and the balance (30) days prior to that was also a negative $716.00.

2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
This Account 130-630 was used for a source of transfer because of the unencumbered balance
remaining in this account.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from
(None) no purchases, programs, contract or other obligation will be deferred or delayed in this
account.

4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
A surplus exists in account 130-630 Rental of Office Equipment because the Recorder's office
wasn't able to find space to house our Microfilm and Tract Books. The Microfilm and Tract Books
remained in the lower level basement of the Recorder of Deeds office funds were not incurred.
