 PERMIT REVIEW COMMITTEE REPORT TO
COMMISSION ON CHICAGO LANDMARKS
August 2, 2012
The Permit Review Committee (PRC) met on July 12, 2012, at 1:15 p.m. The meeting was held at 121

The following project was reviewed by the PRC:
1.

330 N. Wabash
(IBM Buildings – 42nd Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed design of a previously approved entry canopy and metal curtain for the
ground floor hotel lobby.

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. As proposed, the canopy shall be no greater than 21’- 3 ½” in depth, 24’-7”
in width and 2’ in thickness;
2. Signage details shall be submitted for staff review and approval with the sign
permit application; and,
3. There was concern raised at the meeting regarding the exposed light bulbs
under the canopy as well as the overall light levels and the illumination color
used on the first floor (main lobby, hotel lobby, porte cochere) of the
building. Your team confirmed that the illumination color on the first floor
would be consistent (i.e. all cool or all warm) and the lighting levels would
be balanced across the spaces, as per recent discussions with management.
The Committee agreed that a mock-up of the underside of the canopy would
be helpful to determine if the bulbs should be partially concealed and/or the
lighting should be dimmable. Please contact staff to review the mock-up
and final design of the canopy lighting.
