HONORABLE CITY COUNCIL

RE: Michaelangelo Jackson, et al. v. City of Detroit, et al.
Wayne County Circuit Court CA. No. 18-001339 NI

Representation by the Law Department of the City employee listed below is
hereby recommended. We agree with the recommendation of the head of the
department that the officer was acting within the scope of his employment at the time
the acts complained of were committed. We further recommend that the City
indemnifies the Defendant and, therefore, recommend a vote on the attached
resolution for P.O. Steven Fultz, Badge N0: 141

Please note that a copy of the original Law Department letter dated May 14,
2018 is attached (excluding the privileged and confidential attachments which were
previously circulated via email). A closed session was held in this case on April
24, 2018 to discuss trial/settlement strategy.

At the July 17, 2018 Formal Session, City Council denied representation of
PC. Fultz (line item 54). Subsequently, City Council held a closed session
regarding representation on November 9, 2018. This closed session (commonly
referred to as a Loudermill hearing is a due process requirement pursuant to the US.
Supreme Court?s holding in Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill, 470 US 532
(1985). Arbitration awards issued by the Voluntary Labor Arbitration Tribunal also
recognize the past practice of City Council holding hearings for police officers who
have been denied representation (see Grievance Nos. 79-237, 82-055, 90-047, and 92-


The request for the hearing was not triggered in this case as both the Law
Department and DPD recommended approval of representation and indemnification.
P.O. Fultz was entitled to receive and the City of Detroit was required to hold this

hearing. Now that the closed session on representation has occurred and additional
and/or new information was presented to Council in this matter it is timely and
apprOpriate for the attached resolution to be presented to your Honorable Body for a
1 vote.

 

Please advise the Law Department Liaison, Ericka Savage Whitley, if you are
in need of any of the privileged and confidential documents that were previously
distributed in this matter.

HONORABLE CITY COUNCIL ..
RE: Recodification of Chapter 61 of the 1984 Detroit City Code, Zoning, to

Chapter 50 of the 2018 Detroit City Code (RECOMMEND APPROVAL)

RECOMMENDATION

The City Flaming Commission (CPC) respectfully recommends approval of the recodified
Zoning chapter being submitted by the City Clerk and the Law Department as part of the
ordinance to effect the recodi?cation of the 1984 Detroit City Code.

BACKGROUND

State law mandates the periodic updating of a municipality?s city code. The current 1984 Detroit
City Code consists of 61 chapters. The forthcoming 2018 Detroit City Code will have 50
chapters. Consistent with the Michigan Zoning Enabling Act, the CPC provided public notice in
the Detroit Legal News of Wednesday, October 31, 2018 and convened a November 15, 2018
public hearing for the proposed changes to the Zoning chapter.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES IN THE ZONING CHAPTER

The recodifled Zoning chapter does n_ot address land use issues of substance but there are many
?housekeeping? matters?principally the renumbering of the entire Zoning chapter?that are
required by law. Several land use terms are being altered but the permissibility of those land
uses remains unaltered.

The proposed, recodi?ed Zoning Ordinance, Chapter 50 of the 2018 Detroit City Code, will
differ from the current Zoning Ordinance, Chapter 61 of the 1984 Detroit City Code in a number
of ways:

II Section numbers throughout the Zoning Ordinance are being adjusted.
- As state statutes and local ordinances have been amended, obsolete or inaccurate cross-
references are deleted or corrected.

I Lists of land uses, conditions, or other items are routinely preceded by an explicit
statement to indicate the tOpic of the section catch line.

References to discontinued or renamed governmental departments, agencies, and of?ces
are removed, updated or corrected.

I Appropriate reference to the City Charter is inserted where the Zoning Ordinance
authorizes establishment of a fee.

I The vocabulary of. certain land uses is changed without altering the permissibility of the
given land use in a given zoning district, namely:

0 ?Bathhouse? is renamed ?Public bathhouse? for consistency with references
elsewhere in the City Code.

0 ?Fireworks sales? is renamed ?Fireworks sales, consumer;? the terms, ?Display
?reworks,? ?Low-impact fireworks,? ?Articles pyrotechnic,? and ?Special
effects? are added as new de?nitions in Article XVI for consistency with
references elsewhere in the City Code.

0 ?Home for the aged? is dissociated from the land use ?Adult foster care? for
consistency with State law and the term is newly de?ned in Article XVI and listed
as a permissible land use in the same zoning districts as at present.

0 ?Massage therapy clinic? is renamed ?Massage facility.?

0 ?Tattoo parlor and/or piercing parlor? is renamed ?Body art facility? and is
de?ned in Article XVI.

?Secondhand store? is renamed ?Used goods dealer facility? for consistency with
references elsewhere in the City Code and is de?ned in Article XVI.

?Secondhand jewelry store? is renamed ?Precious metal and gem dealer facility,?
the use is newly de?ned in Article XVI for consistency with references elsewhere
in the City Code.

?Public storage house? is renamed ?Public storage facility.?

club? is newly de?ned for consistency with references elsewhere in

the City Code.

- Provisions regarding ?Development plan areas? are repealed or revised consistent with
Emergency Manager Order No. 36 and Ord. No. 34?14.

00

The recodi?ed Zoning chapter is not a component of the ongoing two-year revision and update
of the Zoning Ordinance.

CPC DELIBERATIONS AND RESULTS OF THE PUBLIC HEARING

At the Planning Commission?s meeting of November Commissioners raised numerous
questions of CPC staff and of the representatives of the City Clerk?s Dennis Mazurek
and Ms. Josephine Powell.

At the CPC meeting of November 15, 2018, a public hearing was held regarding the
recodi?cation of the Detroit City Code, one chapter of which is ?Zoning,? Chapter 50. Four
members of the public offered testimony at the hearing: none was opposed to the recodi?cation;
two supported the proposed changes; two others offered comments and posed general questions.

CONCLUSION

Consistent with its bylaws and after receiving testimony at its public hearing, the CPC voted on
November 15, 2018 to recommend incorporation of the proposed Zoning chapter into the
recodi?ed Detroit City Code, as summarized in the CPC report of November 14, 2018,.
