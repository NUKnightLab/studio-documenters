The following projects were reviewed by the PRC:
1.

1060 W. Addison
(Wrigley Field – 44th Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed bleacher reconfiguration for a patio and construction of a 75’ x 7.35’
changing image LED sign on a section of the right-field bleachers.

Action:

Approved 3-2 (Commissioners Wong and Smith voted against) with the
following conditions:
1. Provide all dimensions, materials, finishes and details of proposed 75’ LED
changing image signage for Historic Preservation staff review and approval
as a part of the sign permit application;
2. Provide details, colors, etc. of chain link fence in front of sign;
3. Provide colors and finishes for concrete panels and new railing
installations, which shall match the existing color scheme for the outfield
bleachers; and,
4. Proposed signage is reviewed on a case-by-case basis, and the
Commission’s approval of the proposed sign should not be considered
indicative of how it may consider other similar proposed signs in the future,
both in terms of the specific proposal as well as relative to the cumulative
visual impact of signage on the historic and architectural character of the
ballpark. Additionally, the Chicago Cubs may wish to consider submitting
a Master Sign Program to govern the future review and approval of signage
if additional signs are contemplated.

residential building without a permit.

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. The existing rooftop decks, rails, and walkways shall be modified to be set
back from the front and side parapets per the attached sketch to minimize
their visibility from the public way. The permit drawings shall be modified
accordingly;

building shall also be added to the scope of work and shall be painted a
color to match the brick; and,
