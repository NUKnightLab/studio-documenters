ZAHRA ALI, Director, Department of Revenue
requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners to transfer funds totaling $8,000.00 from and to the
accounts listed below, for enhanced revenue compliance efforts.
Reason:

The Department of Revenue has increased compliance efforts for cigarette confiscation and
illegal sales. This has resulted in increased revenue, as the department continues levying
sizable fines. Transportation expenses have also increased; this is due to more field
investigations throughout Cook County. Such field investigations and new departments
utilizing the Department of Administrative Hearings have lead to increased costs associated
with the administrative hearings collection process. These costs include certified mailing and
delivery services. Additionally, the department's printing costs have escalated due to our
aggressive Use Tax collection and Wheel Tax efforts. We are sending out more notices and
correspondences to delinquent taxpayers.

current obligation on September 13, 2010. The balance for Delivery Services was $327.00,
Transportation and Other Travel Services for Employees was $2,035.00 and Printing and
Publishing was $311.00. Thirty days prior the balance for Delivery Services was $638.00,
Transportation and Other Travel Services for Employees was $2,256.00 and Printing and
Publishing was $7,467.00.

2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
The accounts used for the source of transferred funds were identified based upon potential revenue
recovery, priority and need. The accounts used were the only accounts considered.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from 007-355 and 007-630.
No other obligations will be impacted as a result of these transfers.

4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
The accounts that we are transferring from have available balances due to effectively monitoring of
expenses closely throughout the year and conserving costs. This allows us to increase our
compliance efforts and pursue identified revenue opportunities. However, we will continue to
strategically streamline operations, conserve costs and operate off a tighter budget. In no way does
the department have an unobligated surplus.

APPROVAL OF PAYMENT
ITEM #20
APPROVED
Transmitting a Communication, dated September 22, 2010 from
JAMES D'AMICO, Director, Department of Facilities Management
requesting approval of payment in the amount of $298,923.00 to BMS CAT, Fort Worth, Texas, for
disaster recovery, remediation and restoration services required due to the flooding at the Criminal Courts
Complex, South Campus Buildings on July 24, 2010.
Reason:

The Purchasing Agent in a letter dated August 27, 2010, advised the Board of Commissioners
of the emergency purchase of these services made necessary by the uncontrolled flooding
from torrential rain and sewer backup into the buildings. Visible microbial growth appeared
due to the high moisture content remaining from the initial cleanup. This situation would
only worsen if not addressed immediately. The vendor chosen was still on site for work at the
Criminal Courts Administration Building and is a Government Services Association Certified
Contractor under Contract GS-07F-0087T and is a nationwide company specializing in
disaster recovery. These services were procured in accordance with Section 34-156,
Emergency Purchases, as authorized under the Cook County Procurement Code.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $298,923.00. (200-235 Account).

JAMES D'AMICO, Director, Department of Facilities Management
requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners to transfer funds totaling $213,018.00 from and to
the accounts listed below to continue department operations and meet anticipated shortfalls.
Reason:

200-190: Increased travel between facilities required to meet workload demands as a result

charts will be standardized and updated with correct information.
200-333: Due to the increasing cost of supplies these funds are necessary for day to day
operations for the remainder of this fiscal year. This account was reduced to meet budget
amendments requiring reductions and does not have sufficient funds for the remainder of this
fiscal year.
200-445: Due to the recent acquisition of vehicles, through interdepartmental transfers these
funds will be needed to meet obligations for the remainder of this fiscal year.
200-450: Due to an aging physical plant more repairs are needed on a regular basis. This
account was reduced to meet budget amendments requiring reductions and does not have

following accounts listed below.
Reason:

The Office of the Public Administrator is requesting the transfer of the following accounts to
re-allocate funds for the remainder of the fiscal year. Re-allocating the funds to the General
& Contingent Expenses line item will allow the office to update the records inventory and
contract a company to destroy old records in accordance with the local records act.

From Accounts:
390-190
390-441
390-630

Transportation and Other Travel Expenses for Employees

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
On May 23, 2010 the balance of the account became zero. Re-allocating the funds to the General
and Contingent Expenses line item will allow the office to update the records inventory and
contract a company to destroy old records in accordance with the local records act.

2.

How were the accounts used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
On September 17, 2010, the Office of the Public Administrator reviewed current expenditures and
noted three accounts that would not be used for the specific accounts appropriated prior to the end
of the fiscal year. All accounts are currently balanced and no transfer is needed as a result of
deficient spending.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
190 Transportation and Other Travel Expenses for Employees
Procedures and protocols involving the Investigators underwent a review and subsequent
modifications were implemented. These changes optimized updated technologies and modernized
computer search engines allowing the office to restructure and update the investigation process.
Consequently, less transportation and travel expense was ultimately realized. Furthermore, the
updating of this process has allowed our office to streamline the investigation department while the
addition of an internal investigator has provided a more efficient and cost effective investigations
operation.
441 Maintenance and Repair of Data Processing Equipment and Software
By advancing funds from the office’s operating account this office received a discounted amount
for the licensing of the necessary equipment and products. It is expected that the cost of licensing
shall increase for fiscal year 2011.
630 Rental of Office Equipment
Previous rented directories have been replaced by purchasing licensing online with funds
appropriated to the operating account.

TRANSFER OF FUNDS continued
ITEM #42 cont’d
Reason:

The per page cost of courtroom transcripts provided by the Official Court Reporters is
determined by the State of Illinois. The most recent increase in these rates was a full 25%,
and was not provided for in the 2010 Budget. Despite our best efforts to ensure that only
essential transcripts are ordered, we find that the original appropriation is insufficient. In
addition, increases in the cost of supply items, along with the need to purchase large amounts
of CDs, DVDs, and print cartridges as a result of technological advances and the increased
use of videotaped interrogations, has caused us to spend more for office supplies than was
originally projected.

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
250-268: Although we have had concerns about this account for most of the year, by July 31 the
balance was down to $72,404.00, clearly indicating the need for a transfer. On June 30 the balance
was $191,367.00.
250-350: Although this account does not currently have a negative balance, after reviewing the
July 31 Trial Balance, our projections indicated the need for additional funds. At that point the
balance was $109,114.00. On June 30 the balance was $162,358.00.

2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
Accounts 217, 225, 240, 260, 263, 441: After reviewing the August 30 balances, and projecting
expenses through the end of the fiscal year, we have identified these accounts as having sufficient
surplus for transfer.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from.
None.

4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
250-217: This account is used for the travel expenses of witnesses brought in from out of town to
testify, and for the extradition of prisoners from other jurisdictions. Expenses this year have been
10% to 15% lower than originally anticipated, resulting in this surplus.
250-232: Postage expenses have been somewhat lower than previous years, at least partly due to
the increased use of electronic media.
250-240: Improvements in our IT capabilities have allowed us to do more of our printing in-house.
In addition, we have recognized significant savings by using the Cook County Digital Graphics
Department in place of private vendors.
250-260: With the exception of our Drug Diversion and Education Program, which accounts for
the majority of spending from this line item, in 2010 we virtually eliminated the use of outside
providers of professional services, resulting in this surplus.
250-263: This account provides for the hiring of outside counsel, primarily in civil cases where
special expertise is required or where potential conflicts of interest may exist. It is difficult to
predict these cases in advance, and 2010 costs have been slightly lower than original estimates.
250-441: In April of 2010 we went live with our new Ciber Law Elite CRIMES Case Management
System. Although we originally budgeted the first year of the contractual maintenance and support
for this system in 2010, since our final acceptance of the system did not take place as early as
expected, the annual payments will not begin until 2011.
