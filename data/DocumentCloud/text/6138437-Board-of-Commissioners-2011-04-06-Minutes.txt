7

Sec. 38-133.

Death caused by wrongful act; liability for expenses incurred.

Any person, individual, partnership, corporation, firm, company, trust, estate, political
subdivision, state agency, or any other legal entity who causes the death of a decedent by a wrongful act,

pay any and all expenses incurred by such investigation and the associated burial expenses. The same

Sec. 38-134.

Transportation costs.

All transportation costs of the body incident to the Medical Examiner's investigation shall be
recoverable from the estate of the deceased.
Sec. 38-135.

Fees.

The Medical Examiner shall charge the following fees with the amounts as set in Section 32-1 of
this Code.
(1)

Autopsy report.

(2)

Toxicology report.

(3)

Miscellaneous Reports, including artist's drawings, but not including police reports.

(4)

Permit to cremate a dead human body obtained from the Office of the Medical Examiner,
by facsimile or electronic filing.

(5)

Return fee. The Return Fee is charged to funeral homes that pick up bodies from the
Medical Examiner's Office and then request to return them to the Office after determining
that the family has no funds for burial. This cost would include the cost of the burial
shell and the burial cost.

(6)

Death certificate amendment fee. Fee is charged if the amendment is made later than 1
year of the person's death (due to a return by Funeral Home). The Office of the Medical
Examiner is charged by the Illinois Department of Vital Records for amendments made
to a death certificate after 1 year of the death.

(7)

Storage fee. This fee covers the bodies returned (by the Funeral Homes) to the Office of
the Medical Examiner for storage while families secure funds for burial services. This
"storage fee" would replace the "return fee" if a funeral home returns a body and picks it
up again within 10 days. If the body is not picked up within 10 days, the body will be
held and buried by the County according to the standard operating procedures of the
Medical Examiner. This "storage fee" discourages the use of the Office of the Medical
Examiner as a storage location by funeral homes and also encourages the funeral

directors to verify that families have funds for burial prior to removing a body from the
Office of the Medical Examiner.

It shall be unlawful for any individual to impersonate the Medical Examiner and/or any Medical
Examiner investigator.
Sec. 38-138.

Penalty for violation.

Any person who knowingly violates any provision of this Ordinance shall be fined not more than
$1,000.00 and imprisoned not more than six months.
Sec. 38-139.

Annual report.

The Medical Examiner shall prepare and submit to the Cook County Board of Commissioners an
annual report of the activities of his/her office.
Sec. 38-140.

Medical Examiner Fees Fund.

Beginning on or before March 1, 2011, the Comptroller shall create a special revenue fund to be
entitled the, “Medical Examiner Fees Fund.” The revenue collected by the Office of the Medical
Examiner from all of the various fees of the Office of the Medical Examiner shall be placed in such
special fund for the Office of the Medical Examiner to be held by the Treasurer of the County. Such
revenues collected and placed in such special fund shall only be disbursed by appropriation of the County
Board and shall be used solely for the purchase of electronic and forensic identification equipment or
other related supplies and the operating expenses of the Medical Examiner’s Office.

9

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 6, 2011

samples shall be forwarded to the Illinois State Police for testing and inclusion in the State and National
DNA Database. Immediately after the Illinois State Police have completed all DNA analysis, testing and
database inclusion, the remaining evidence shall be returned to the Office of the Medical Examiner.
Sec. 38-152.

Number of bodies per casket.

Each coffin or burial shell sent by the Medical Examiner to a contracting cemetery authority shall
contain the remains of only one indigent, unclaimed or unknown decedent. In the case of infants and
fetuses, the Medical Examiner shall be permitted to place multiple infants and fetuses in a single burial
shell, provided that there shall exist a physical barrier separating each set of remains within each such
burial shell. No other tissues or skeletal remains, human or otherwise, shall be permitted in such shell.
Sec. 38-153.

Unique Personal Identifiers.

Prior to the burial or interment of an indigent, unclaimed or unknown individual, the Office of the
Medical Examiner shall affix one non-biodegradable Unique Personal Identifier tag to the outside of the
burial shell. Such tag shall be stamped or inscribed with the decedent’s name, age and year of death, if
known. The Office of the Medical Examiner shall additionally affix at least one non-biodegradable
Unique Personal Identifier tag to the individual deceased person’s physical remains.
Sec. 38-154.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
A RESOLUTION TO STRONGLY URGE THE ILLINOIS SENATE HOUSE
TO OPPOSE SENATE BILL 1386 OR EXEMPT COOK COUNTY FROM ITS APPLICATION

18

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 6, 2011
WHEREAS, Senate Bill 1386 proposes to retroactively extend the five year statute of limitations for
refund claims for property tax overpayments to a period of twenty years under Section 20-175 of the
Illinois Property Tax Code and would result in serious fiscal consequences on taxing districts in Cook
County and across the State of Illinois; and
WHEREAS, Senate Bill 1386 would open the flood gates to as many as fifteen years worth of refund
claims that are time-barred under current law, and have a devastating impact on taxing districts’
realization of critically important property tax revenues in the coming years as refunds would be
deducted, pro rata, from current collections to be paid to the applicable taxing districts; and
WHEREAS, Senate Bill 1386 provides for any installment of property taxes which are overpaid after
January 1, 1990 to be refunded for a period of twenty years after the date the right to a refund arose, when
a petition for refund is filed with the circuit court or a claim is made to the county collector; and
WHEREAS, Senate Bill 1386 would effectively slash the revenues that taxing districts depend on to fund
schools, pay employee salaries, and meet bond covenants and pension obligations, inevitably forcing
most taxing districts to increase their property tax levies to compensate for these lost revenues; and
WHEREAS, some taxing bodies would see their bond ratings lowered as a result of SB 1386 at a time
when state budget cuts are forcing districts to seek bond financing merely to continue basic operations;
and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Treasurer’s Office has implemented a program known as STOPS for the
express purpose of identifying, intercepting and preventing duplicate property tax payments and
overpayments before they occur which will dramatically reduce, if not eliminate all together, the
incidence of property tax overpayments in Cook County; in the one-month collection period that ended
December 13, 2010, more than $20 million of property tax overpayments were intercepted and returned to
taxpayers as a result of the STOPS program.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that the Cook County Board of Commissioners strongly
urges the Illinois Senate House to oppose Senate Bill 1386 or exempt Cook County from its application;
and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Secretary to the Board of Commissioners tender suitable copies
of this Resolution to the members of the Illinois Senate House of Representatives.

A RESOLUTION STRONGLY URGING THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS
TO MAINTAIN COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT FORMULA FUNDING
AT ITS FY 2010 LEVEL
WHEREAS, Community Development Block Grand Grant Formula (CDBG) funding would be cut 62.5
percent under the House FY 2011 HR1 budget proposal and further reduced by 7.5 percent under the
Obama Administration proposed FY 2012 budget recommendation as part of their deficit reduction
efforts; and
WHEREAS, Cook County’s CDBG program FY 2010 HUD allocation of $10,665,762.00 would be cut
by the House under HR1 by $6,666,101.00 and $118,256.00 $799,932.00 by the Obama Administration
for FY 2012 thereby decimating assistance to low and moderate-income beneficiaries; and
WHEREAS, CDBG is one of the most effective federal domestic programs to revitalize communities
with proven results and funds a wide range of activities including housing-related assistance, public
improvements, public services, and economic development projects; and
WHEREAS, CDBG funds assist local government in revitalizing neighborhoods to create safe, nurturing
communities for families; one CDBG funded project can revitalize a neighborhood and extend the life of
its public infrastructure by 20 years; and
WHEREAS, every $1.00 of CDBG funds leverages an additional $1.62 in non-CDBG funds and helps
create jobs; in this current economic climate it is absolutely paramount that leveraged projects which put
people to work receive the highest consideration for funding; and
WHEREAS, the preservation of CDBG funding at the FY 2010 level is supported by the National
Association of Counties (NACo), the U.S. Conference of Mayors (USCM) and the National League of
Cities (NLC)members; and
WHEREAS, CDBG FY 2010 grant funds of $3.95 billion generated 120,000 jobs and contributed $10.7
billion in Gross Domestic Product over the past year alone according to the IHS Global Insight report
released by NACo, USCM, and the NLC; and
WHEREAS, the CDBG program is a catalyst for local economic growth that puts people to work,
improves infrastructure, and provides a mechanism for pursuit of economic development initiatives which
are the kinds of investments that will generate real long-term growth in Cook County and communities
across the Nation; and

20

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 6, 2011
WHEREAS, eliminating CDBG funding may save money in the very short term but will hurt
communities nationwide in the long term and thereby further weaken the U.S. economy.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Cook County Commissioners does
hereby strongly urge the members of the U.S. Congress to fund the CDBG program at the FY 2010 level;
and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Secretary to the Cook County Board of Commissioners
delivers a suitable copy of this Resolution to President Obama, Chairman of the Senate Committee on
Appropriations Daniel Inouye, and the members of the United States Congress.

A RESOLUTION TO URGE THE ILLINOIS SENATE TO OPPOSE
SENATE BILL 152 OR EXEMPT COOK COUNTY
WHEREAS, Senate Bill 152 will require that all Illinois auto insurers submit physical damage
subrogation claims to a national organization for arbitration there by eliminating due process and the
filing of these claims in a court of law; and
WHEREAS, Senate Bill 152, passed by the Illinois Senate Insurance Committee on March 10, 2011 is
now headed to the Senate Floor for a vote; and
WHEREAS, this legislative mandate will divert millions of dollars in Cook County court filing fees and
have a deleterious effect on the Cook County budget and the revenues of the Circuit Court of Cook
County; and
WHEREAS, the Circuit Court of Cook County had 7,237 automobile subrogation claim cases in 2010
with a part of the filing fees by plaintiffs and by defendants for these cases earmarked to support the
highly successful court annexed arbitration system program which disposes of substantial numbers of
lawsuits without submission to jury trials; and
WHEREAS, the mandatory arbitration called for in Senate Bill 152 would cause layoffs in the
courthouse, possibly the end of the court annexed arbitration facilities, and would unfairly prevent the
opportunity for both parties to disputed automobile physical damage claims to personally present their
cases in the courts.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners urges the
Illinois Senate to oppose Senate Bill 152 or exempt Cook County and allow due process in all cases of
automobile subrogation claims in Cook County; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Secretary to the Board of Commissioners tender suitable
copies of this Resolution to the members of the Illinois Senate.

A RESOLUTION STRONGLY URGING THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS TO
MAINTAIN COMMUNITY SERVICES BLOCK GRANT (CSBG) FUNDING
WHEREAS, a proposed 50 percent cut in Community Services Block Grant (CSBG) federal funding for
local community action agencies such as Cook County’s private, not-for-profit Community and Economic
Development Association (CEDA) will seriously damage already scarce community resources and have a
devastating impact; and
WHEREAS, CSBG is not just a program under HHS but a federal investment that creates an
infrastructure able to respond locally to the national problems that cause poverty; in 2009 and 2010
CSBG was 8th out of 200 Recovery Act programs in jobs created and saved; and
WHEREAS, CSBG funds local community action agencies like CEDA to reduce poverty, revitalize lowincome communities, and empower low-income families to become self-sufficient; and
WHEREAS, with CSBG funding, CEDA serves as the major vehicle by which our most vulnerable
citizens receive vital services which assist them on the path toward economic stability; 240,000
households in Cook County were assisted through CEDA in FY 2010; and

24

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 6, 2011

WHEREAS, while representing only 3% of CEDA’s overall budget, CSBG funds leverage Head Start, a
portion of Home Weatherization, LIHEAP, Women, Infant and Children centers, and other programs;
every $1.00 of CSBG funds leverages an additional $7.00 of non-CSBG funds for the Head Start
program; and
WHEREAS, CSBG has developed a highly structured management and accountability system known as
ROMA (Results Oriented Management and Accountability) which is also a frame work for assessment,
planning, and analyzing data that helps local agencies to manage and to continually improve performance
and outcomes; and
WHEREAS, in this current economic climate it is absolutely imperative that successful CSBG programs
that leverage dollars and also create and save jobs receive the highest consideration for funding; and
WHEREAS, eliminating CSBG funding will impede rather than assist the country’s economic recovery.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Cook County Commissioners does
hereby strongly urge the members of the U.S. Congress to fund the CSBG program at the FY 2010 level;
and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Secretary to the Cook County Board of Commissioners
delivers a suitable copy of this Resolution to President Obama, Chairman of the Senate Committee on
Appropriations Daniel Inouye, and the members of the United States Congress.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Committee on Contract Compliance of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County met pursuant
to notice on Wednesday, April 6, 2011 at the hour of 9:30 A.M. in the Board Room, Room 569, County
Building, 118 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois.
Your Committee has considered the following item and, upon adoption of this report, the
recommendations are as follows:
311628

OFFICE OF COOK COUNTY COMMISSIONER, ROBERT B. STEELE. Transmitting a
Communication by Robert B. Steele, dated March 11, 2011:
Please add the following information as a new item for the March 15, 2011 Board Agenda to
be referred to the Contract Compliance Committee. The following information will be
discussed by the Contract Compliance Administrator LaVerne Hall:
Contract Compliance reporting requirements. How often will reporting be requested from the
Contract Compliance Department and what information should be included in the reports?
Should a subcommittee be formed to review large waiver requests?
Capacity Building Initiative - Define what a successful program would accomplish?
This meeting will be an informational meeting only.
*Referred to the Committee on Contract Compliance on 03/15/11.

Chairman Steele introduced LaVerne Hall, Contract Compliance Administrator, and entered her agenda
and quarterly reports into the record. He noted that Ms. Hall will be reporting to the Contract Compliance
Committee on a quarterly basis.
Ms. Hall noted that both online certification efforts and veterans certification programs are going well,
and have been a priority for the office of Contract Compliance.
Ms. Hall explained some of the break out categories on the reports.
In response to Commissioner Reyes’ concern regarding veterans, Ms. Hall responded that a veterans’
breakout will be added in 2012.
Ms. Hall clarified that these reports address neither the Forest Preserve District nor the Cook County
Health and Hospitals System.
Commissioner Beavers noted the lack of African American participation as indicated in the Professional
Services Contracts Report.

112

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 6, 2011

Ms. Hall stated that quarterly reports will allow the Committee to review how it is doing in reaching its
MBE/WBE goals.
In response to Commissioner Garcia’s inquiry as to how to get MBE/WBE firms more involved, Ms. Hall
stated that she is looking to host a “technology mixer” in May to bring local firms and large companies
together.
Commissioner Sims stated that it is imperative that there be transparency in Cook County government,
and that the aforementioned “technology mixer” might make it look as if Cook County had a hand in
choosing certain firms or companies.
Commissioner Sims inquired whether a representative of the State’s Attorney’s Office could inform them
how the City of Chicago deals with waivers and contract compliance.
Patrick Driscoll, Deputy State’s Attorney and Chief, Civil Actions Bureau, indicated he did not have
knowledge of how the City of Chicago handles these matters. He did indicate, however, that if more than
four Commissioners meet together over this issue, they need to notice the meeting.
Chairman Steele turned to the issue of creating a Waiver Committee, which would address how to assess,
grant and deny waivers. He stated that this Committee would also work to inform as many firms as
possible as to MBE/WBE opportunities. Chairman Steele stated that he would meet with President
Preckwinkle regarding the creation of a Waiver Committee, and indicated that he would like Vice
Chairman Silvestri to be present at this meeting.
No action was taken on the above item, as this Committee meeting was for informational purposes
only.
Chairman Steele asked the Secretary to the Board to call upon the registered public speaker, in
accordance with Cook County Code, Sec. 2-107(dd):
PUBLIC SPEAKER:
1. George Blakemore – Concerned Citizen
Commissioner Goslin moved to adjourn the meeting, seconded by Vice Chairman Silvestri. The
motion carried and the meeting was adjourned.

Commissioners in the amount of $497,028.00.

requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to extend for one (1) year, Contract No.08-41-343 with
Rush Computer Rentals, Duluth, Georgia, for rental of computers used at Early Voting sites.
Reason:

This extension is needed to expend the existing funds on this contract as we explore

Rental met the requirements for a Request For Proposal (RFP) issued in 2008, and have the
qualifications and experience to perform the services requested. Approximately $93,730.00

by
CLEM BALANOFF, Deputy County Clerk
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to renew Contract No. 09-41-244 with J.J. Collins
Sons, Inc., Woodridge, Illinois, for printing and mailing of voter information.
Reason:

The County Clerk requests to exercise a two (2) year renewal with J.J. Collins Sons, Inc. A
two (2) year renewal is necessary because the Election Department will not be able to develop
a scope of work for a new contractor during the labor-intensive November, 2012 Presidential
election cycle. The Contractor has agreed to a lower renewal cost from 2010-2011
pricing. J.J. Collins Sons, Inc. responded to a Request for Proposal (RFP) issued on May 19,
2009 with the lowest and best proposal and is an experienced printer with the necessary
resources to perform the specifications of the RFP. The Clerk intends to issue an RFP for a
new contract for this work in the fourth quarter of 2012.

by
CLEM BALANOFF, Deputy County Clerk
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to renew Contract No. 09-41-245 with Graphic
Purchasing Solutions, LLC, Northbrook, Illinois, for the printing of ballot applications.
Reason:

The County Clerk requests to exercise a two (2) year renewal with Graphic Purchasing
Solutions, LLC. A two (2) year renewal is necessary because the Election Department will not
be able to develop a scope of work for a new contractor during the labor-intensive November,
2012 Presidential election cycle. The Contractor has agreed to a lower renewal cost from
2010-2011 pricing. Graphic Purchasing Solutions, LLC responded to a Request for Proposal
(RFP) issued on May 19, 2009 with the lowest and best proposal. The Clerk intends to issue

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $199,500.00 (FY 2012 - $114,000.00; and FY 2013 - $85,500.00). Contract
period: May 1, 2011 through April 30, 2013. (524-240 Account). Requisition Nos. 25240003 and

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 6, 2011
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to renew Contract No. 09-41-13 with Pickens Kane
Moving and Storage, Chicago, Illinois, for moving of election equipment.
Reason:

The County Clerk requests to exercise a two (2) year renewal with Pickens Kane Moving and
Storage. Contractor has agreed to a lower renewal cost from previous pricing. Pickens Kane
Moving and Storage responded to a Request for Proposal (RFP) issued on August 13, 2008.
Pickens Kane Moving and Storage had the lowest cost proposal and is an experienced mover
with the necessary resources to perform the specifications of the RFP.
This renewal is necessary as we move toward a new way to bid these requirements. The
original contract dated 11/19/2008 was $3,676,824.00 for six elections. This renewal is for
two years and four elections. It is $119,340.37 less that the original $2,692,576.00 cost for
two years and four elections. A two year extension is necessary to bring us through four
elections, including the 2012 Presidential Primary, Presidential General and the two elections
in suburban Cook County in 2013. Post-election activity and pre-election preparation are
extremely time-sensitive and work-intensive before and after a Presidential election. Elections
contracts are planned accordingly so new contractors are not employed between these intense
elections cycles. There is no time to issue an RFP for this contract and establish a scope of
work with a new contractor prior to the March 2012 Presidential election as the contractor
must be in place for Election Judge training by January 1, 2012.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $2,573,235.63 (FY 2012 - $1,622,000.00; and FY 2013 - $951,235.63).
Contract period: May 2, 2011 through April 30, 2013. (524-430 Account). Requisition Nos. 25240004
and 35240003.
Sufficient funds are available in the County Clerk Election Division Fund.
Vendor has met the Minority and Women Business Enterprise Ordinance.

DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY AND EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT
APPROVAL OF PAYMENT
Transmitting a Communication, dated March 18, 2011 from
ROBERT D. KING, Deputy Director, Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management
requesting approval of payment in the amount of $23,812,30 to Enterprise Fleet Management Services,
Lombard, Illinois for the outstanding and final lease payment for two vehicles previously on lease by the
Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management.
Reason:

In April, 2010, pursuant to an Open Market Purchase ("OMP"), the Department of Homeland
Security and Emergency Management ("DHSEM") received authorization for a six (6) month
lease agreement with Enterprise Fleet Management Services ("Enterprise") for the lease of
two 2010 Chevrolet Suburban 1500 LTZ 4x4's. Pursuant to the OMP, the fiscal impact was
$32,493.44 and the OMP was authorized under the Cook County Disaster Assistance Grant;
to date, $25,505.75 has been paid under the original six (6) month lease and OMP.
Without authorization, in April of 2010, the previous DHSEM leadership also entered into a
24-month master lease/purchase agreement with Enterprise and thereafter, in November of
2010, DHSEM requested authorization from the Cook County Board of Commissioners
("Board") to purchase the above noted vehicles; authorization was deferred by the Board and
subsequently withdrawn by the Administration. The vehicles remained in the possession of
DHSEM and lease payments remain outstanding.
Enterprise has requested payment in the amount of $23,812.30 to address outstanding lease
payments (October, 2010 thru February, 2011) and further invoiced the DHSEM in the
amount of $61,443.68 for the purchase of the vehicles and close out of the master lease
agreement. The total amount invoiced to DHSEM was $85,255.98. In order to prevent
additional liability and at the request of the Administration, the two above listed vehicles were
returned to Enterprise on February 25, 2011. Following negotiations with Enterprise,
Enterprise has agreed to accept payment in the amount of $23,812.30 for the outstanding lease
payments and close out of the lease; Enterprise has further agreed to release the County of any
further obligation under the master lease agreement.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $23,812.30. (565-634 Account).

Commissioner Tobolski, seconded by Commissioner Steele, moved that the payment to Enterprise Fleet
Management Services be made. The motion carried unanimously.

TRANSFER OF FUNDS
Transmitting a Communication, dated March 18, 2011 from
ROBERT D. KING, Deputy Director, Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management
requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners to transfer funds totaling $23,813.00 from Account
565-110, Salaries and Wages of Regular Employees to Account 565-634, Rental of Automotive
Equipment.
Reason:

Transfer of funds request to finalize and terminate lease agreement for two vehicles
previously on lease by the Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management
using funding from vacant positions.

From Account 565-110

Total

$23,813.00

To Account 565-634

Total

$23,813.00

1.

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
On March 18, 2011, it became apparent that the Rental of Automotive Equipment Account 565-634
would require an infusion of funds in order to meet outstanding financial obligations for and
termination of a lease agreement for two vehicles previously on leased by the Department of
Homeland Security & Emergency Management. At this time the balance in the account was $0. The
balance 30 days prior was $0.

2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
The 110 Salaries and Wages of Regular Employees account was identified based on the use of
vacant position funding to be transferred for the purpose of payment of outstanding financial
obligations on the aforementioned vehicle lease contract. The Department previously planned to
hire into vacant positions during the fourth quarter of Cook County Fiscal Year 2011.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from.
DHSEM’s hiring plan for impacted vacant positions will be adjusted according to approval of its
transfer of funds and subsequent payment and termination of the lease agreement for these vehicles.
This should not affect any programs, contracts or obligations that this department has for Fiscal
Year 2011.

4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 6, 2011

TIMOTHY C. EVANS, Chief Judge, Circuit Court of Cook County
Pursuant to General Administrative Order 2011-02, the Cook County Board of Commissioners is hereby
requested to approve payment of $200,000.00 to the Center for Conflict Resolution, Chicago, Illinois (the
Center), payable from the Not-For-Profit Dispute Resolution Fund, County Fund 531.
Reason:

The Center was the only applicant for these funds in 2010. By statute, fees from civil
filings are collected solely for this purpose.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $200,000.00. (531-818 Account).
IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF COOK COUNTY, ILLINOIS
GENERAL ADMINISTRATIVE ORDER NO. 2011-02
SUBJECT: ILLINOIS NOT-FOR-PROFIT DISPUTE RESOLUTION ACT
Pursuant to the Illinois Not-For-Profit Dispute Resolution Act (710 ILCS 20/1 et seq.), the Clerk
of the Circuit Court of Cook County has collected fees from civil filings for disbursement to the Dispute
Resolution Centers which qualify under said Act and General Order 19 of the Circuit Court of Cook
County. Fees available for disbursement from this Fund for the year 2010 total $270,631.50.
Upon review of applications received for funds collected in 2010, the sole qualifying applicant
under the requirements set forth in said Act and General Order 19 of the Circuit Court of Cook County
was found to be the Center for Conflict Resolution. It is eligible for the maximum amount allowable for
disbursement to any Dispute Resolution Center in a given year of $200,000.00.
Pursuant to the Illinois Not-For-Profit Dispute Resolution Act (710 ILCS 20/1 et seq.), any funds
collected but not disbursed in a given year shall be paid in single county judicial circuits to the County
Treasurer for the administration of justice in the judicial circuit. An amount of $70,631.50 remains
collected for the year 2010 but no other Dispute Resolution Center is qualified to receive disbursement of
these funds.
Therefore, it is hereby ordered that the amount of $200,000.00, representing the maximum
amount allowable for disbursement to any Dispute Resolution Center in a given year, shall be disbursed
to the Center for Conflict Resolution.
Further, it hereby ordered that the amount of $70,631.50 representing funds collected under the
Illinois Not-For-Profit Dispute Resolution Act for 2010 but not disbursed shall be paid to the Treasurer of
Cook County for the administration of justice in the Circuit Court of Cook County.

Board District #17, Property Index Numbers: 08-26-100-014-0000, 08-26-100-015-0000, 08-26-100-0160000, 08-26-100-017-0000; and
WHEREAS, Cook County has defined abandoned property as buildings and other structures that, after
having been vacant and unused for at least 24 months, are purchased for value by a purchaser in whom
the seller has no direct financial interest; and
WHEREAS, in the instance where the property does not meet the definition of abandoned property, the
municipality or the Board of Commissioners, may determine that special circumstances justify finding
that the property is abandoned for purpose of Class 6b; and
WHEREAS, in the case of abandonment of less than 24 months and purchase for value, by a purchaser in
whom the seller has no direct financial interest, the County may determine that special circumstances
justify finding the property is deemed abandoned; and
WHEREAS, Class 6b requires the validation by the County Board of the shortened period of qualifying
abandonment in cases where the facility has been abandoned for less than 24 consecutive months upon
purchase for value; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners has determined that the building was abandoned
for four (4) months at the time of application, and that special circumstances are present; and
WHEREAS, the applicant estimates that the re-occupancy will create an estimate 55-60 new full-time
jobs; and
WHEREAS, the Village of Elk Grove Village states the Class 6b is necessary for development to occur
on this specific real estate. The municipal resolution cites that special circumstances exist in that the
property has been vacant and unused for less than 24 months and the property is at a competitive
