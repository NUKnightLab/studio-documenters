PROPOSED RESOLUTION
IN OPPOSITION TO THE RELOCATION OF THE
COOK COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH
TO THE OAK FOREST HOSPITAL OF COOK COUNTY CAMPUS
WHEREAS, the Cook County Department of Public Health has been located at
its current location at 1010 Lake Street in Oak Park, Illinois since 1992, having
relocated from its Maybrook County Courthouse facility for the purpose of
providing additional courtrooms; and
WHEREAS, the facility is centrally located in Cook County in downtown Oak
Park, accessible to the CTA Green Line and the Blue Line, the METRA railroad
line and the Eisenhower Expressway and numerous PACE and CTA bus lines;
and
WHEREAS, the facility includes the Department’s administration offices, various
educational programs, and public information resources, which are utilized by
municipalities, public and private schools, community groups, the press and the
public; and
WHEREAS, Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County is located in the far southwest
section of the County and is not nearly as accessible as the Oak Park location;

WHEREAS, the Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County site requires the
expenditure of public funds, which far outweigh a long term rental of space in a
central location; and
WHEREAS, the people of Cook County and their municipalities and schools are
better served in an accessible, central location, which has been utilized as such
for the past seventeen years.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and Board of
Commissioners direct that all efforts and expenditures planned for the relocation
of the Cook County Department of Public Health be terminated.

AMENDMENT TO THE BOARD OF HEALTH ORDINANCE (PROPOSED
ORDINANCE AMENDMENT). Transmitting a Communication, dated March 30,
2009 from Stephen A. Martin, Jr. Ph.D., M.P.H., Chief Operating Officer,
Department of Public Health:
the Cook County Department of Public Health (CCDPH) respectfully requests the
Board of Commissioners approve the proposed amendment to the Cook County
Board of Health Ordinance.
This proposed amendment serves two purposes. First, it clarifies the authority of
the Cook County Department of Public Health to require certain types of statelicensed providers within the department's jurisdiction to participate in the
electronic submission of syndromic surveillance data. This data is extremely
useful to the efforts of the Department in communicable disease control and has
the potential to alert us to an outbreak in its very early stages, when intervention
may be most effective. Many health providers currently participate in this
program on a voluntary basis and we would like to pursue participation
arrangements with more providers to improve our efforts in this very exciting
program.
The second purpose of the proposed amendment is to memorialize
authorizations, many of which have been extended to the Department by the
Board through Board Resolutions in the past regarding various types of routine
memoranda of agreement the Department periodically needs to enter into.
These agreements are typically programmatic in nature and do not involve the
establishment of fees, except to the extent that fees have been separately
approved by the Board and set forth in the schedule found at Chapter 32 Fees of
the Cook County Code.
Submitting a Proposed Ordinance Amendment sponsored by
TODD H. STROGER, President, JERRY BUTLER and ELIZABETH “LIZ”
DOODY GORMAN,
County Commissioners

patients, Medicaid patients with heart disease and immigrants with broken bones
have been among those that come to Stroger Hospital of Cook County for urgent
follow-up care after being stabilized or evaluated elsewhere; and

in the emergency room of Stroger Hospital of Cook County with diagnosis,
