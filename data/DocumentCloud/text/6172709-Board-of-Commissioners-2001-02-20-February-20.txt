On December 1, 2000, after a public comment period, the Authority submitted the Plan for
Transformation, Year 2, MTW Annual Plan to HUD for approval. As a result of negotiations
with HUD, an Amendment was drafted and agreed upon by both CHA and HUD. Highlights of
the Amendment include a restatement of HUD's commitment to provide $1.565 billion of capital
funding necessary to produce 25,000 units of public housing to CHA; direction on calculating
the block grant of Section 8 Funds, modification of SEMAP in consultation with CHA and
description of the commitments necessary to clarify CHA's authority to leverage funds.
RESOLUTION NO. 2001-CHA-19

ratification of Amendment No. 1 to CHA's Moving To Work Agreement;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners ratify Amendment No. 1 to CHA's Moving To Work
Agreement.

(Item B2)
In 1999, HUD implemented a system for assessing the performance of public housing authorities
nationwide, known as the Public Housing Assessment System (PHAS). In measuring PHA
performance, PHAS utilizes four indicators as follows: physical inspection, financial assessment,
management operations and residential satisfaction survey. Due to industry concerns with the
new system, HUD will not issue assessment scores for indicators 1, 2 and 4. HUD will issue an
assessment score for #3 and staff estimates that the Authority will be granted an overall score of
"B". The resolution for Item B2 approves and certifies the Authority's FY2000 PHAS
submission as required by HUD.
RESOLUTION NO. 2001-CHA-20

p.m. at the 626 Corporate Office. MAP and Programs staff presented a report on Public Housing

FY2000 no score will be attributed to Indicator #4.

 Commissioner Young then introduced an Omnibus Motion for the adoption of Items C1, C3, C4
and C6 recommended for approval by the Tenant Services Committee.

Commissioner Gates then presented the report for the Operations & Facilities Committee
meeting held on Wednesday, January 10, 2001 at the 626 Corporate Office. Per Commissioner
Gates, marathon sessions were held with the recommended Master Developers for Taylor,
Stateway and Rockwell. The recommended Master Developers successfully addressed several
concerns posed by the Committee. Issues discussed included, but were not limited to, delivery of
social services, benchmarks, and responsibility of Developers.
Commissioner Gates then introduced an Omnibus Motion for the adoption of Items D1, D2,
D2(a), D3, D4 and D7 recommended for approval by the Operations & Facilities Committee.
(Item D1, D2 and D2(a))
A Request for Qualifications (RFQ) was issued by the CHA and The Habitat Company for the
redevelopment of the 92-acre site at Robert Taylor Homes A & B (Item D1), 17-acre site at
Rockwell Gardens (Item D2) and 33-acre site at Stateway Gardens (Item D2(a). The responses
to the RFQ were received and evaluated by the Working Groups for each development,
composed of resident leadership of each development, CHA, Habitat, Gautreaux plaintiff's
counsel and City entities. The Working Groups evaluated Development Team respondents per
5

 the RFQ selection criteria and recommended Brinshore-Michaels Development Team by
consensus for Robert Taylor. The Brinshore-Michaels Team is a joint venture between Brinshore
Development, LLC and Michaels Development Company, Inc
East Lake Development Management Company (East Lake) was recommended as Master
Developers for Rockwell by the majority of the Working Group. East Lake is the principal of
the development team and has also identified team members qualified to carry out the essential
aspects of predevelopment activities.
The recommendation of Stateway Associates as Master Developers for Stateway Gardens was
made by a consensus of the Working Group. Stateway Associates is a joint venture with four
principal partners: The Davis Group, Mesa Development, LLC, Kimball-Hill Homes and the
Walsh Group.
Michael-Brinshore, East Lake and Stateway Associates have all identified team members
qualified to carry out the essential aspects of the predevelopment and development activities,
including architects, planners, construction companies, financial partners and social service
partners.
CHA and Habitat expect that the development process will have the following two (2) phases: 1)
Predevelopment, which commences with the selection of a Respondent and ends with the
execution of a Redevelopment Agreement based on the development proposal; 2)
Implementation, which commences with execution of the Redevelopment Agreement based on
the approved development proposal and concludes with the completion of the final phase of
redevelopment.
The resolutions for Item D1, D2 and D2(a) will enable CHA to enter into an interim agreement
to start the first phase of activities. The second phase covers the remaining predevelopment
activities leading to a Redevelopment Agreement and approved development proposal. CHA
and Habitat will negotiate the entire contract including both phases of predevelopment activities
and present the contract to the Board for approval.

(Item D4)
Due to dangerous conditions at Michigan Boulevard Garden Apartments (MBGA), the City has
demanded its closure. Since 90% of the MBGA residents receive Section 8 assistance, the City,
several of its elected officials and the CHA have agreed to immediately relocate the affected
7

 residents. The CHA desires to use the City's current agreement with Changing Patterns to

There being no questions or discussion, the Chairperson thereupon declared said motion carried
and said resolutions adopted. The report of the Operations Committee was also accepted in total.
(Item D6)
The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) offers incentives to housing
authorities that enter into Energy Services Agreements (ESA). These incentives allow the CHA
to leverage additional capital through the financing of qualified energy conservation measures
under an energy loan. As required by the incentive, the CHA, using non-federal funds, i.e. a
$15,000,000 loan from ABN-AMRO at a tax-exempt interest rate, invests in improvements to a
building's energy-using systems that are guaranteed to meet certain energy use and cost reduction
goals. These improvements provide a return through the cost savings they generate, which in
turn provides for the repayment of the energy capital loan. The resolution for Item D6 requests
approval to increase the scope of the ESA agreement with EUA for an additional $15,000,000 to
add additional developments, in accordance with CHA's long term capital plan. Since the cost of
the EUA agreements is paid out of the energy cost savings generated by the installed
conservation measures, and since the ESA is self-amortizing, the CHA anticipates that the
additional work will also be self-amortizing, thus releasing money that the CHA would otherwise
have spent from its Capital fund on the improvements. Under the Moving To Work Agreement,
the CHA's subsidy eligibility is frozen through 2002. Therefore, if the Authority enters into this
agreement, it will be responsible for 1 1/2 years of payments toward the loan if construction
commences by July 1, 2001. Staff does not anticipate any additional incentive subsidy until
2003; however, by installing energy and water efficiency measures that have the best payback
potential immediately, the CHA can generate a cash flow sufficient to meet repayment
obligations. Incentive subsidy payments would resume in 2003, thus guaranteeing repayment of
the loan amount through out the remainder of the 12-year contract term.
Commissioner Young moved the adoption of the following resolution for Item D6.
RESOLUTION 2001-CHA-30
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated February 20,
2001 requesting authorization to amend and increase the Energy Performance
Contract with EUA Citizens Conservation Services and ABN-AMRO Chicago
Corporation to allow the CHA to increase the total amount authorized from
$15,000,000.00 to $30,000,000.00 to improve CHA’s buildings’ energy-using
systems under HUD’s Performance Contracting Incentives and in conformity with
the CHA’s Plan for Transformation;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to negotiate with EUA Citizens Conservation Services and ABN-AMRO
Chicago Corporation to increase the amount of energy services work from
$15,000,000.00 to $30,000,000.00 and to execute the negotiated agreements.

THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to execute a Collective Bargaining Agreement between the Service

(Item E3)
In December 2000, the Board of Commissioners authorized the extension of the CHA's current
contracts with Blue Cross Blue Shield, Humana, and First Commonwealth Dental for the period
of January 1 thru March 31, 2001. An insurance broker was retained, through a small
procurement, to assist the CHA with obtaining premium quotes from health, dental and vision
care insurance providers by non-competitive proposals, through a procedure approved by HUD.
A comparison of the services, opportunities, benefits and premium rates offered by CIGNA for
PPO and HMO medical benefits, First Commonwealth for dental benefits and Davis Vision for
vision benefits indicate that these providers best meet the needs of CHA eligible participants at
rates most favorable to the CHA. The resolution for Item E3 requests authorization to enter into
contracts with the three (3) named providers.
RESOLUTION NO. 2001-CHA-34
