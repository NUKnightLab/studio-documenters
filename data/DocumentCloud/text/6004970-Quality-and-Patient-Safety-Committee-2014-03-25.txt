Report from System Chief Quality Officer
A. Regulatory and Accreditation Updates
Dr. Krishna Das, System Chief Quality Officer, provided an update on regulatory and accreditation visits.
She stated that the Cook County Department of Public Health (CCDPH) received accreditation by the
Public Health Accreditation Board; this is a singular achievement, as only one percent of public health
departments in the country have this accreditation. Dr. Terry Mason, Chief Operating Officer of CCDPH,
and Dr. Linda Rae Murray, Chief Medical Officer of CCDPH, will give a full report on the accreditation
process at the next meeting.
Dr. Das stated that the Ambulatory and Community Health Network of Cook County (ACHN) was recently
surveyed by The Joint Commission (TJC). This was the triennial survey and was expected but
unannounced. The surveyors came last week on Monday for a four day survey by two surveyors.
Although the administration does not yet have the final report from TJC, Dr. Das was pleased to report that
what was communicated at the exit interview and what is posted on TJC’s website to date is a very good
report. There were only ten citations issued out of a total of over 1,000 standards. The surveyors went out
of their way to tell staff that it was an excellent survey for an ambulatory network. Many of the citations
have already been corrected, but staff has between forty-five and sixty days to make corrections. A more
detailed report will be provided once the full letter from TJC is received.

Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
A. Reports from the Medical Staff Executive Committees (continued)
Also mentioned was the subject of Meaningful Use. Dr. Ukoha stated that Meaningful Use initiatives are
not only to provide the patients with opportunities to electronically review their records, but ultimately
should be viewed as ways to educate patients in their efforts to find and maintain their relationship with their
medical homes.
Dr. Anwar Hussain, President of the EMS of Provident Hospital of Cook County, presented his report. He
stated that there is one issue that keeps coming up at EMS meetings, regarding patient access, which is a
