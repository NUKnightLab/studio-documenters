A. Minutes of the Finance Committee Meeting, May 18, 2018
Director Richardson-Lowry, seconded by Chairman Reiter, moved to accept the
Minutes of the Finance Committee Meeting of May 18, 2018. THE MOTION
CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

B. Contracts and Procurement Items (Attachment #1)
Douglas Elwell, Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Finance and Strategy, provided an overview of the contractual
requests presented for the Committee’s consideration. The Committee reviewed and discussed the requests.
With regard to request number 6, Mr. Elwell stated that CCHHS does not pay any money to Vizient, so the typical
Contract Compliance goals did not fit the circumstances for the contract; however, the administration has worked
with Vizient to expand the number of minority contractors that would be available under the Group Purchasing
Organization (GPO) and to work specifically in Cook County, to expand the number of companies that they have
qualified to be part of their program. Director Richardson-Lowry requested that further information on Vizient’s
progress and achievements on those two (2) activities be provided to the Committee through the Chair.

Ekerete Akpan, Chief Financial Officer, provided an overview of the information contained in the report. The

During the discussion of the Income Statement on slide 4 of the presentation, Board Chairman Hammock inquired
regarding whether the operating revenue as reflected is the gross or net amount. Mr. Akpan responded that it is
the net amount. Board Chairman Hammock noted that in other financial reporting scenario, the operating revenue
figure would be the gross amount, and provision for bad debt expense and other allowances would be listed below
it before arriving at a net number. He suggested that Mr. Akpan discuss this with the auditors to see if and how
this can be reflected.
