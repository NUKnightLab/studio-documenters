the sole purpose of satisfying the reasonable costs and expenses of the staff of the OTA.
The account managed by the Transitional Administrator shall be subject to audit as
determined by Cook County.
The District Court previously entered an order funding the OTA account at $800,000.00,
which amount was transferred from the Self-Insurance Fund as authorized by the Cook
County Board of Commissioners on July 22, 2008 (Communication No. 295184).

was issued by the Court on December 18, 2008.
Upon approval, the Cook County Comptroller will transfer $500,000.00 from the SelfInsurance Fund to the OTA account in compliance with the court order.
The Cook County Comptroller is requested to prepare the check by January 21, 2009
which is prior to the next court date. Please forward the check to Andrew J. Creighton,
