Project Manager:

Emily Zgonjanin

Project History: This project consists of the construction of a 200 bed, 5 story precast concrete veterans’ home, located
at the southwest corner of West Forest Preserve Road and North Oak Park Avenue. The facility will include private
bedrooms and private bathrooms, 16 residential kitchens, a commercial kitchen, administrative, recreational, and support
spaces, outdoor space and parking for 181 vehicles. The completed building will be LEED Silver Certified.
The architect has adjusted the door and hardware schedule on the project by revising the door sizes, fire ratings, door
types, and hardware. Due to these revisions, it will be several weeks before the door frames will be onsite for installation.
The contractor will be required to partially frame and drywall the door openings and then return to install the door frames
and finish framing the walls and drywall out of sequence to keep the framing and drywall progressing to meet the
schedule.
Proceed Order G-33 provides for the revisions to the doors, door frames and hardware, and for the installation of the wall
framing and drywall in two phases; (1) partial installation of the wall studs and drywall, (2) return once door frames are
onsite to install and complete the framing and finish the drywall around the frames.
This change is for the General Contractor – IHC Construction Companies.
Description of RFP Change: This proceed order provides for the revisions to the doors, door frames, and hardware. It
also provides for the installation of the metal stud and drywall out of sequence due to the delayed door frame procurement.
This change will be classified as an AE error.

Requested Action: We are requesting Board Approval of Proceed Order G-33 in the amount of $159,285.55

The Department of Veterans’ Affairs requested a redesign to the water management systems to prevent Legionella

system, manual flushing of cold water, and the addition of a cleaning system for the cool tower basin.
Approval of these change orders will allow the project to proceed on schedule toward the substantial completion date of
December 2, 2019.
Description of RFP Change: Changes to the general, plumbing, heating and electrical scope of work to address water
management system changes to prevent Legionella disease. This change will be classified as a User Request.

Project Manager:

Darnell Barnes

Project History: The General Jones Armory is a 299,772 square foot, five story building constructed in 1929. The scope
of work for this project includes upgrading the HVAC and the ventilation systems for the main offices and restrooms on the
south side of the drill hall. The scope will incorporate a Variable Refrigerant Volume (VRV) system and high efficiency
boiler system. The scope also provides for a building control system to monitor all systems. The electrical work will be
required to ensure the building service will meet equipment loads. The ceiling work will be required for equipment and
piping mounted in the ceiling space. The scope of work also provides for the abatement of asbestos containing materials.
This project was placed on hold on July 1, 2015, due to the State of Illinois Budget Impasse. After three years on hold the
condition of the HVAC and ventilation systems worsened; thus creating the need for pre-construction testing on the
performance of the existing equipment. This testing was done to ensure that the equipment being installed within the current
scope would indeed be functional after installation.
Description of RFP Change: During the pre-construction testing, multiple items were discovered to be non-functional and
will require correction through repair or replacement. These items are outside of the original scope of work. This will be
classified as a user requested change.

Requested Action: We are requesting approval of Proceed Order H-4 in the amount of $217,350.00 to address the
necessary corrections to the system.

PROJECT SCOPE OF WORK:
The Capital Development Board (CDB) is seeking design firms to provide ongoing architectural, engineering and construction
administration services for non-specified CDB projects. The projects may be at various locations and facilities throughout the
state. This solicitation is for the northern part of the state. In this capacity, the successful firm(s) could undertake a wide variety
of projects for the CDB that may include, but not limited to, analysis or investigative reports, development of construction and
bidding documents (drawings and specifications) and construction administration services, among others. The selected firm(s)
must have, either in-house or through consultants, the following disciplines, including, but not limited to:
•
Architecture - 40%
•
Structural Engineering - 15%
•
Mechanical Engineering (HVAC, Plumbing and Fire Protection) - 25%
•
Electrical Engineering - 10%
•
Civil Engineering - 5%
•
Specialty Engineering/Consultants as needed - 5%
•
The associated percentages of work are based on past projects and are a guide for selecting a team. The percentages are in
no way guaranteed and are dependent on the types of projects that the CDB requires during the contract period.
Projects will typically be either an emergency or urgent in nature. Services are to be provided on an open-order basis for three
fiscal years beginning July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2022, with the option for two additional one-year renewals to allow for the
completion of any open task assignments.
For projects with a reasonable and normal time-frame, the successful firm(s) and the CDB shall mutually prepare a brief written
task order, which shall include a brief project description and scope of work, an approximate schedule and an approximate
professional services fee. For projects of an immediate or emergency nature ("on-call"), the successful firm(s) shall invoice the
CDB on an hourly basis, in accordance with terms mutually agreed upon prior to signing the contract.
For non-emergency projects, the maximum threshold will be basic services of $25,000 per project and the aggregate of the basic
services will not exceed $525,000. The total value of the contract for architectural / engineering services (basic services,
additional services, on-site representation and reimbursables) will not exceed $1,000,000. This method of project development
will not be used for regular capital appropriations.
Design firms interested in submitting their qualifications should have demonstrated knowledge and experience with architectural
/ engineering services. A combined MBE/WBE/VBE goal of 15 percent is applicable to the A/E team.
No project costs have been established for these projects at this time. The architects, engineers and their consultants will be
responsible for developing a complete project budget for each task assignment as their design progresses. The scope of work
for each individual task order shall be determined by the CDB. The architects or engineers will be required to comply with all
the CDB contractual requirements.
