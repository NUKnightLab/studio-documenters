PRESIDENT
CURRENT PLANS AND CONSIDERATION OF ALTERNATIVES REGARDING
THE TRAFFIC COURT/DOMESTIC VIOLENCE COURT FACILITY

Transmitting a Communication, dated March 20, 2001 from
JOHN H. STROGER, JR., President, Cook County Board of Commissioners
As you have no doubt heard or read the Traffic Division of the Circuit Court operations which were
recently relocated to the Daley Center are running efficiently and in fact far more smoothly than had been
expected. After discussing this matter with various parties including the Chief Judge of the Circuit Court,
I now believe that there is a need to revisit plans to construct a new Traffic Court/Domestic Violence
Court facility. I am hereby requesting that the County Board review current plans and give consideration
to alternatives to satisfy the needs of the Circuit Court. I ask that this request be referred to an appropriate
committee of the County Board for discussion and public hearing.

Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Hansen, moved to suspend the rules so that this
matter may be considered. The motion carried unanimously.
Commissioner Hansen, seconded by Commissioner Daley, moved that the communication be referred to
the Committee on Finance. (Comm. No. 242357). The motion carried unanimously.

the motoring public; and
WHEREAS, it is in the best interest of the motoring public that these highway improvements be

Authority as specified by State Statute 73 5 ILCS 5/7-103 (1998); and

from 26,800 to 44,700 vehicles per day, and the proposed improvement consists of the widening
of an existing grade separation from four lanes to six lanes; and
WHEREAS, a request for Quick Take Authority specifically for said improvements need be
directed to the Legislature of the State of Illinois from the Board of Commissioners of Cook County in
order to enact such Quick Take legislation.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and Members of the Cook
County Board of Commissioners, request the State of Illinois to grant Quick Take Authority to the

requesting authorization to accept a grant from the Office of Justice Programs of the Bureau of Justice
Assistance of the U.S. Department of Justice. The program to be funded by this grant is entitled
Representing Noncitizen Criminal Defendants in the State of Illinois.
The goal of this program is to enhance the level of legal representation rendered in Illinois to indigent
noncitizen defendants facing immigration consequences as a result of state criminal proceedings. This goal
will be accomplished through the dual objectives of: 1) enhancing the level of legal representation afforded
to indigent noncitizen defendants in criminal cases in Illinois by providing public defenders and appointed
counsel with a resource (i.e., a reference manual) and training for assessing the potential immigration
consequences of state criminal proceedings, and 2) improving judicial economy by reducing the court time
devoted to post-dispositional motions dealing with unanticipated immigration consequences.
This grant has no required hard match, but does have a soft match which will be met by utilizing existing
personnel.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: None. Grant Award: $77,500.00. Funding period: June 1, 2001 through
January 15, 2003.

A SALUTE TO GIRLS LINK
WHEREAS, in the United States between 1990 and 1999 arrests of juvenile females generally increased
more than arrests of juvenile males; and
WHEREAS, in recognition of this alarming and regrettable trend, Cook County justice agencies as early
as 1994 created an initiative known as the Juvenile Female Offender Project to address the gender-related
needs of girls involved in our juvenile justice system; and
WHEREAS, this planning grant facilitated the design of a continuum of care model that links the young
female offender with a case manager who follows her throughout her involvement in the system, helping
to bridge any gaps in available services; and which incorporates gender-responsive programming in order
to strengthen and support girls in coping with the social, psychological, and emotional pressures of
juvenile detention and/or exposure to the juvenile justice system; and

1213

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 20, 2001
WHEREAS, the Juvenile Female Offender Project, now known as GIRLS LINK, has been funded in part
by the U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP), and

through advocacy, education, policy, and program development a gender-responsive systemic culture that
meets the needs of girls who are involved in the Cook County Juvenile Justice System; and

GIRLS LINK by conferring on GIRLS LINK the NCCD New American Community Award which

Transmitting a Communication, dated March 20, 2001 from
JOHN H. STROGER, JR., President, Cook County Board of Commissioners
I am pleased to announce that the County has received $6,491,066 reimbursement from the U.S. Justice
Department's Fiscal Year 2000 State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP), making this the
fourth award received, to date, under the program.
Since these represent unbudgeted funds in the County's FY2001 budget, I am recommending that these
funds be permanently transferred to the Forest Preserve District to immediately replenish the Working
Cash Fund. Additionally, a surplus of $1.8 million currently exists in the County's Expressway
Construction Fund. These funds are the remainder of bonds issued in the 1950s and 1960s to construct
the area's expressway system, and have been a small part of the County's fund balance for a number of
years. Since these funds represent proceeds from long retired bonds, I am recommending that these funds
also be transferred to the District. These transfers will serve to (i) reduce the $16.2 million deficit to
approximately $7 .9 million; (ii) provide needed liquidity to the District until property tax distributions
and seasonal golf revenues are received; and (iii) demonstrate to the rating agencies and the investment
community our commitment to solving the current financial problems at the District.

1214

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 20, 2001
Along with other steps taken to date, I firmly believe that this action further represents my commitment to
addressing the long-term financial challenges facing the District. With the continued support of the
Board, together, we can ensure that the future of the District is protected.

RESOLUTION

Whereas, the County of Cook is a home rule unit of local government pursuant to Article 7,
Section 6 of the 1970 Illinois Constitution; and
Whereas, pursuant to home rule powers, Cook County may exercise any power and perform any
function which pertains to its governance and affairs; and
Whereas, the Board of Commissioners of County of Cook has determined that it is in the best
interest of Cook County government to assist the Cook County Forest Preserve District in reducing
budgetary deficits; and
Whereas, Cook County has recently received reimbursement funding of $6,491,066 from the
U.S. Justice Department under the Fiscal Year 2000 State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP);
and
Whereas, the SCAAP funds represent unrestricted and unbudgeted funds in the County's FY
2000 budget; and
Whereas, Cook County has further identified a surplus of $1,800,000 existing as unexpended
funds from the County's Expressway Construction Fund acquired as proceeds from bonds issued in the
1950s and 1960s to construct the area's expressway system; and
Whereas, these surplus finds have been carried for many years as a small part of the County's
fund balances and are unrestricted as to use; and
Whereas, the transfer of these funds to replenish deficits in the Forest Preserve's Working Cash
Fund will serve to (i) reduce the $16.2 million deficit to approximately $7.9 million; (ii) provide needed
liquidity to the District until property tax distributions and seasonal golf revenues are received; and (iii)
demonstrate to the rating agencies and the investment community the County Board's commitment to
solving the current financial problems facing the Forest Preserve District.
Now, Therefore, Be It Resolved:
That the Chief Financial Officer of Cook County be authorized and directed to take all actions
necessary to effect the transfer of the $6,491,066 SCAAP funds and the $1,800,000 surplus Expressway
Construction Funds to the General Fund of the Cook County Forest Preserve District with the restriction
that these funds be used to replenish the Working Cash Fund.
