TRAFFIC WARNING SIGNS SIGNALS:

West Belmont Avenue and North Lawndale Avenue; All Way Stop Sign, Stopping All
Approaches, Not Recommended. W. Belmont Avenue is a minor arterial roadway with
significantly higher traffic volumes than N. Lawndale Avenue, a local roadway. Stop
signs on streets with higher volumes Such as W. Belmont Avenue tend to increase
rear-end crashes. increase congestion, and create a false sense of security for
pedestrians that every vehicle will stop. Given the offset between the north and south
legs of N. Lawndale Avenue, stop lines on W. Belmont Avenue would be spaced
approximately 100 feet apart and would lead to driver confusion and low compliance.
Therefore. CDOT does not recommend an all-way stop at this intersection.
