Board and Committee Reports
B. Quality and Patient Safety Committee Meeting, April 14, 2015 (continued)
Director Gugenheim presented the Meeting Minutes and reviewed the metrics with Dr. Krishna Das, Chief Quality
Officer. The Board reviewed and discussed the information.
In response to a question regarding comparing the data to other safety-net hospitals, Dr. Das stated that this is a little
bit of a challenge; it is difficult to get to that data without accessing the current data from all of the other hospitals.
The System has a lot of interactions with America’s Essential Hospitals, which is a group of public hospitals, and
has viewed its data against theirs, but it is only an aggregate. Dr. Shannon added that, often, when the System gets
information from benchmarks, whether they are local partners or safety net institutions from across the country, it is
old information; this information being presented is current. That is a bit of a challenge, to compare the System’s
current performance to old benchmark data.
Director Wiese inquired whether staff track the time to appointment, as part of the overall experience. Dr. Shannon
responded that they are not exactly tracking time to appointment; rather, they are looking at demand, and satisfying
that demand. An industry standard that is used is the “third next available appointment” which tracks for all
specialties and primary care services. They also follow the size of the queue. Director Wiese inquired whether a
measure can be provided in the metrics on that subject. Dr. Shannon responded that there are challenges; for
example, averages could be provided for primary care, but at some of the sites the measurements may be very short
and some very long, so the average is not as useful as a range. Additionally, for the specialties, that can be
provided, but a lot of information is lost in the average. Chairman Hammock stated that Committee Chairman
Gugenheim and Dr. Das will take this under advisement and will further review the subject.
Director Lerner stated that, with regard to the question of what is the right benchmark for the System going forward,
the System has a different challenge, because it is both a safety-net hospital and an academic institution. While
attention should be paid to national benchmarks, what ought to be discussed going forward is whether the local
competition is the right benchmark, because patients are going to have choice - it is a local choice, not a national
choice.
Director Gugenheim, seconded by Director Marsh, moved the approval of the Minutes of the
Quality and Patient Safety Committee Meeting of April 14, 2015. THE MOTION CARRIED
UNANIMOUSLY.

C. Managed Care Committee Meeting, April 16, 2015
i. Metrics (Attachment #2)
ii. Meeting Minutes
Director Lerner presented the Meeting Minutes and reviewed the metrics with Steven Glass, Executive Director of
Managed Care. The Board reviewed and discussed the information.
Chairman Hammock inquired regarding the data on inpatient utilization; he noted that this is the third month in a
row that a decrease is being seen. Director Lerner noted that the second part to Chairman Hammock’s question
relates to the outpatient utilization experience across the whole population. There are conflicting objectives
between a managed care operation and a hospital - a managed care operation wants the inpatient number to go down
and a hospital operation wants the inpatient number to go up. Douglas Elwell, Deputy Chief Executive Officer,
stated that this represents the System’s share of the inpatient claims that were paid; they may all go down, but the
System’s share is going down faster than the others’ shares. The administration has a much lower expectation of
the Family Health Plan population coming to its hospitals than it did of the Affordable Care Act population, as the

Board and Committee Reports
C. Managed Care Committee Meeting, April 16, 2015 (continued)
System’s hospitals tend to be thought of as more for adults, rather than for children. To some extent, this was
anticipated; however, the administration still wants to get a bigger market capture. Director Marsh inquired whether
information can be obtained, if the downward trend continues, regarding where the members are getting services
provided, if not at the System. Director Lerner indicated that he will see if that information can be provided for the
June meeting.
Included in the metrics was information on the Waiver Evaluation. Director Gugenheim referenced Goal #2 in the
Evaluation findings, regarding expanding access to Medicaid covered services, with a focus on mental health,
substance abuse and prescription drug services. She requested that a deep review be taken with the Board or one of
the Committees on the subject sometime in the future. Director Lerner suggested that it is a good Board-level
question; he asked Dr. Shannon to talk to the staff about how to approach it.
Director Lerner provided an overview of planned subjects for the Managed Care Committee’s deep dive in June.
They are going to look at the current percentage of CountyCare members that are assigned to the System’s own
health centers and the goal relating to that. For members who are assigned to other health centers, how does
CountyCare manage that enterprise and the externalities going on in the market? There will be a slide in June that
looks at some of those health plan comparisons; there are groupings of health plans within that listing, so the
Committee will understand the motivations going on between them. Additionally, he plans to discuss the State’s
fiscal condition and the State’s Medicaid budget. With regard to the Waiver Evaluation, a discussion will be held
regarding what is behind some of the recommendations; additionally he expects to discuss ways to improve the
managed care operations, and how that drives some of the System’s financial performance.
Director Lerner, seconded by Director Marsh, moved the approval of the Minutes of the
Managed Care Committee Meeting of April 16, 2015.
THE MOTION CARRIED
UNANIMOUSLY.

Report from Chairman of the Board (Attachment #5)
Chairman Hammock stated that he and Dr. Shannon put together a list of subjects for in-depth briefings/focus
presentations at Board and Committee Meetings; a draft schedule for focus presentations for the next six months was
distributed. He stated that the draft schedule is the goal; however, sometimes circumstances arise that may require
change – he asked the Committee Chairs to communicate any changes that may be needed to the Secretary, so those
changes can be considered. He plans to provide an updated schedule every quarter that includes the schedule for the
next three or six months.
Chairman Hammock stated that, as the metrics are refined, the Directors will become more comfortable and will not
need detailed explanations. The Board’s focus will instead be on the following: whether the targets are being met; what
are the trends; and what the System is doing to improve from a programmatic standpoint.

VII. Report from Chief Executive Officer (Attachment #6)
Dr. Shannon provided an update on several subjects; detail is included in Attachment #6. The Board reviewed and
discussed the information.

Raju; Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle; Members of the Illinois General Assembly; Douglas Elwell;
Susan Greene; Mary Sajdak; Steven Glass and the Managed Care team; Elizabeth Reidy and the legal team; CCHHS
Board; and CCHHS Staff and Employees. Additionally, The Prairie Group was recognized for their excellent support in

Board Education
A. CCHHS Employment Plan (continued)
The following individuals provided an overview of the presentation regarding the CCHHS Employment Plan:
Carrie Pramuk-Volk, CCHHS Employment Plan Officer; Mary Robinson, Cook County Shakman Compliance
Administrator; and Patrick Blanchard, Cook County Independent Inspector General. The presentation included
information on the following subjects: Purpose and History of the Employment Plan; Oversight; Prohibition of
Unlawful Political Discrimination and Political Contacts; Employment Plan Officer and Human Resources; and
General Hiring Process and Exceptions. The Board reviewed and discussed the materials.
Following the discussion of the information regarding the active recruitment process, Director Marsh remarked that
there is no doctor who is going to wait 100 days to get an offer of employment. She stated that there are two
components – the experience that the applicants have as they go through the hiring process, but there is also waiting
100 days to hear whether or not they have an offer. She noted that, when looking at the table that Human Resources
prepared in terms of benchmarking, there are areas that have required or mandated time periods, such as job
postings and notifications; however, there appear to be other areas that may be improved. There are things that the
Board or System are clearly not going to be able to change right now because they are law. There are things that
can be changed today, and those things that cannot be changed today may hopefully be able to be changed as a
System over months. The System is not going to change the Shakman regulations, but it can change why it is
taking 40 days for the interview selection process, because there does not appear to be any mandate that it take 40
days for that process. It can change why it is taking 25 days to validate, because there does not appear to be any
mandate that it take 25 days to validate. Starting with what cannot be changed about the process, what about the
other ___ days; given that the mean was 203 days, what about the other 180 days that are quite frankly not required
by this process - what can be done about that?
Chairman Hammock noted that Director Marsh’s summary is apropos. He stated that the Board will be having
another session that deals with the labor contracts and how they impact this process. He added that there is also the
issue of staffing of the human resources function to consider.
Chairman Hammock concluded by thanking Ms. Pramuck-Volk, Ms. Robinson and Mr. Blanchard for a good
perspective that the Board all needed. He suggested that a slide be included to highlight that this independent Board
was created in February 2008; it should be clear that the independent Board was created, in large part, over these
issues, to try to provide a more objective approach to running the System as a whole, from what it had been. He
assured the presenters that it is this Board’s intention to fully comply with the spirit of the regulations that have
been promulgated; this Board wants to get to best practices in human resources that allow the System to not be
burdened unnecessarily with process. This Board wants to get there as quickly as possible, because the System has
important vacancies to fill with the very best people that can be found as quickly as possible.

Adjourn
As the agenda was exhausted, Chairman Hammock declared that the meeting was ADJOURNED.

Special recognition to Vista Health Center staff members Victor Medina, RN, Nurse Coordinator and
Administrator and Katy Velasquez, RN for their extra efforts during the recent measles outbreak.

In late February, confirmed measles cases in Suburban Cook County were confined to the Palatine area, where
Vista is located. In addition to a local daycare center/preschool and laundromat, Vista Health Center was cited as
one of the locations where potential exposure might have occurred.

Because of the highly infectious nature of measles and that fact that can be confused with those of a
common cold, Victor and Katy aggressively and effectively tackled the immediate task of calling, tracking and
organizing vaccines for potential exposure clients. In the course of their outreach, Mr. Medina and Ms.
Velasquez spoke to numerous parents and guardians of pediatric clients, 90% of whom are Spanish-speaking. In

addition, letters were sent out to potentially-exposed adult clients, with follow-up coordinated by
Victor and Katy.

A 12-year old boy with Downs and his grandmother travelled to Liberia in June of 2014 and were -
unable to return home to the U5. until mid-October 2014 due to the Ebola outbreak and Li beria's closed
borders. When they returned, they were subject to the 21-day monitoring period as CDC protocols dictated.
Cindy Waller, RN, BSN volunteered to make a home visit to assess the needs of the child and the family during
the 21-day Ebola monitoring period.

The child was at risk of losing his spot in the special needs program at his school for lack of attendance. Ms.
Waller negotiated a return date with the school, following the monitoring period, with a physician release and
assured the school that he would not pose a risk to students or staff.

Ms. Waller introduced additional social services (SNAP, for special needs) to the family which have made a
tremendous difference in their quality of life. The lead abatement program replaced leaded windows in
the home and the child now has a primary care physician.

The family has expressed appreciation for Ms. Waller?s assistance and commitment.

Congratulations to the CountyCare development and implementation team on the recently released
independent analysis of CountyCare conducted by the UIC School of Public Health. The detailed findings
concluded that CountyCare:
- Enrolled 113,779 eligible individuals in the Medicaid program under the new eligibility category (during
the 12/12? 12/13 Waiver period)
- Expanded the healthcare delivery capacity by negotiating network provider contracts with a
broad network of healthcare providers which expanded capacity by:
adding 141 FQHC sites to the existing CountyCare 17 ambulatory clinic sites (16 local and one
regional);
- adding 30 community hospitals including 2 teaching hospitals to the County Care existing
2 hospitals (Stroger and Provident);
adding over 100 physician specialists to the existing CountyCare capacity; and
adding numerous other medical and allied health practitioners as well as
dozens of local pharmacies to the CountyCare provider network
0 Provided medically necessary care to 68% of the CountyCare newly covered individuals in the first 6
months of Waiver operation;
0 Provided medically necessary care to 85% of the CountyCare newly covered individuals within the 12
months of Waiver operation; and
- Expanded choice of a primary care medical home to include the existing CountyCare ambulatory clinic
sites as well as the 141 FQHC sites.

"Activities and Announcements

0 Dr. Shannon participated in a meeting convened by the Illinois Hospital Association to discuss the importance of
Medicaid to safety net institutions and the patients they serve. The meeting included representatives from 15
safety-net hospitals, State Senators Iris Martinez and Kwame Raoul, State Representatives Greg Harris, 
Soto and Emanuel Chris Welch as well as staff representing Senators Tom Cullerton and Donne Trotter.
Following the meeting, Dr. Shannon was interviewed by the Chicago Sun-Times. Story attached.

a Dr. Shannon participated in a healthcare roundtable hosted by the Centers for Medicare 8: Medicaid Services
(CMS) hosted by CMS Acting Administrator and Region CMO Andy Slavitt. As Acting Administrator, Slavitt is
responsible for overseeing the programs that serve the millions of Americans that access health care services
through Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP and the Marketplace. Slavitt and the CMS team are focused on improving
health outcomes, access and affordability while improving health disparities and combatting health care fraud.
Discussion focused on the complexity of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act but also the tremendous
benefit to the overall health of patients and the health care delivery system. Dr. Shannon emphasized, and
Acting Administrator Slavitt acknowledged, the need ensure the Medicaid program is protected.

- Stroger Hospital opened its new 14 bed 4 Flex Unit this week. 4 Flex is a remake of our short stay unit designed
to care for patients who are admitted for what is anticipated to be only a 48-72 hour stay with a condition for
which we have pre-written protocols for work-up. For example, this would include asthma cases where we think
we can bring it under control with a brief course of medication. Additionally, patients with sickle cell disease
might easily be admitted to this unit. In the past these patients may remained in the emergency room instead of
being admitted for a short stay in a hospital room. This is a more appropriate and healing approach. We are able
to get expedited work-ups for these patients and send them home with the clinical question answered that may
have brought them to the emergency room.

0 On Thursday, April 100 burn care professionals toured the Stroger Burn Unit as part of the American Burn
Association?s Annual Conference being held in Chicago this week. The Stroger Burn Unit is verified by the
American Burn Association. The unit treats approximately 400 major burns and performs more than 1,000 burn
evaluations per year. The center has a 6-bed intensive care unit and up to 12 convalescent beds. Expert staff
treat thermal, chemical and electrical burns as well as diseases such as toxic epidermal necrolysis, and all types
of complicated soft tissue wounds.

0 On Wednesday April Dr. Karen DeSalvo, Director of the Office of the National Coordinator for Health
Information Technology (ONCHIT) together with ONCHIT Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Tom Mason visited the CORE
Center to talk with patients and providers about the success of health IT efforts and the importance of
the portal in engaging patients in their own care management. Following the CORE visit, Drs. DeSalvo and Mason
toured the Stroger Emergency and Trauma units. Additionally, more than 100 health IT professionals in town for
the Healthcare Information Management Systems Society (HIMSS) visited throughout the week to see
firsthand our electronic medical record.

0 officially kicked-off its Patient Experience Initiative this week. Senior leadership will visit every 
site to talk with staff about the different components of the initiative which include leadership, patient services
and customer service training. The timing of our PEI launch follows last week?s release of the new hospital star
report by the Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services (CMS) through its Hospital Compare program. The star
ratings relate to patients? experience of care at almost 3,500 Medica re-certified acute care hospitals. On a scale
of 5 stars, Stroger Hospital received an overall rating of 2 stars and Provident received an overall rating of 3

stars. The ratings are based on data from the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and
Systems Survey (HCAHPS) measures that are included in Hospital Compare. HCAHPS has been in use since 2006
to measure patients' perspectives of hospital care. The star ratings will be updated each quarter. This
information has been shared with our teams across the system and managers will be given the tools and
responsibility to improve their facility and department level scores moving forward.

Legislative Update

Local

On Wednesday, April 15th, the Chicago City Council approved the appointment of Dr. Julie Morita as
Commissioner of the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH). Dr. Morita has worked for CDPH for fifteen
years serving as Medical Director for Immunization and most recently as Chief Medical Officer. Prior to CDPH,
Dr. Morita worked for the CDC as an Epidemic Intelligence Service Officer.

Wednesday, April is the next regular meeting of the Cook County Board.

State

On April the General Assembly returned from recess and is focused now on crafting the FY2016 budget.

There is still much discussion of the FY2015 budget agreement, particularly around cuts to social service
agencies. Speaker Madigan has created a Special House Budget Oversight Panel to closely examine recent
budget decisions. The panel has begun to conduct hearings.

Federal

Last September, President Toni Preckwinkle, Board Chairman Hill Hammock and CEO Dr. Jay
Shannon met with US. Senator Richard Durbin and requested assistance in re-instating county jails in the
National Health Service Corps (NHSC) Loan Repayment Program.

The National Health Service Corps was established in 1970 and is a scholarship and loan repayment program
that helps underserved communities across the nation receive medical care. Since 2011 county and municipal

prisons have not been eligible to take part in this program even if the county is located in a health professional
shortage area. Federal and state prisons remain eligible for this program.

4 Page

Page 74 of 98

'The NHSC Loan Repayment Program has been an important pipeline for in recruiting correctional health

service providers. Several providers recruited through the NHSC have continued their service with Cermak
Correctional Health Services, rising to the ranks of leadership. The 2011 change negatively impacted 
ability to recruit correctional health service providers. Providers interested in positions with 
Correctional Health Services routinely inquire about loan repayment and acknowledge NHSC ineligibility as a
major factor in not applying for or accepting a position.

Providing quality care through Correctional Health Services at the jail is an important cog in improving
the health of the patient's community oforigin. When detainees are released and return to their communities 
if they return in good or better health - the health of the community of origin is positively impacted.

In January 2015, President Preckwinkle and Dr. Shannon met with Senator Durbin to further discuss the NHSC.
In February 2015, Dr. Shannon, on behalf of President Preckwinkle, presented a resolution at the National
Association of Counties Legislative meeting in Washington, DC. urging Congress to amend the National Health

Service Corps loan repayment program to allow county and municipal jails to be eligible for the program.

On Thursday, April 23?, US. Senator Richard Durbin introduced legislation to expand the National Health Service
Corps to include county and municipal correctional facilities.

Protection of Medicaid remains a key priority for the Cook County Health HOspitals System at both the State
and Federal level.

Smaller hospitals say state Medicaid cuts could force them to close

 

Diana Novak April 13, 2015

A group of Chicago-area hospitals facing dramatic cuts in state funding under Gov. Bruce Rauner?s ?rst
budget emphasized the dire situation of community health care in a meeting Monday with legislators at
Norwegian American Hospital.

Rauner?s plan to cut more than $1.5 billion from Medicaid with over $800 million coming from
hospitals has leaders of hospitals such as Loretto in the Austin neighborhood concerned they will have
to significantly limit services or just shut their doors.

Leaders from a group of ?safety-net hospitals,? including Loretto, met with state legislators representing
the Chicago area ahead of the passage deadline May 31. Safety-net hospitals, an Illinois Hospital
Association classi?cation, are ones where more than 50 percent of patients rely on Medicaid.

don?t think we can absorb any cuts,? Loretto CEO Dr. Sonia Mehta said. ?We don?t have any fat left.?

More than 40 percent of the state?s hospitals are operating in the red and still dealing with cuts from the
state?s passage of a Medicaid reform bill in 2012, said Maryjane Wurth, president and CEO of the Illinois
Hospital Association.

?There will be a number of hospitals that simply will not be able to keep their doors open,? Wurth said.

State Sen. Kwame Raoul, D-Chicago, said La Rabida Children?s Hospital in his district would likely have
to close if negotiations over Rauner?s 2016 budget don?t improve hospital funding.

?That?s literally the circumstances, not a false alarm,? Raoul said. ?They?ve got a population who
otherwise wouldn?t be served.?

Dr. John Jay Shannon, CEO of the Cook County Health and Hospitals System, said county hospitals
would be indirectly affected by the budget.

?We?re going to see it through things like the jail and through things like the [emergency department],
where we?ll start to see more people coming to us because they no longer are able to get those services
that were in their community,? Shannon said.

State Rep. Greg Harris, D-Chicago, chairman of the Senate House AppropriationsaHuman Services
Committee, called the govemor?s decision to take funding from higher education, hospitals and the
Department of Children and Family Services ?horrible solutions.?

?If [Norwegian American] closes, if St. Mary?s closes, if St. Bemard?s closes, if Sinai closes, if Loretto
closes, if Roseland closes, where do people go in our neighborhoods in Chicago for health care? There are
no places,? Harris said.
