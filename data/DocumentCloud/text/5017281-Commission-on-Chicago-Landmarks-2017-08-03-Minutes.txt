7-story commercial building with rooftop decks, a new curb-cut off Carroll, and
underground parking.
Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
Proposed Demolition:
1. Preliminarily find that the property at 328 N. Carpenter, a 1-story
commercial building, is non-contributing to the character of the
Fulton-Randolph Market District and its demolition will not be an
adverse effect on the character of the Landmark District;
2. Recommend that the Commission recommend to the City Council

a) The massing of the building, with the 6th-floor street facade parapet at
77’-3” tall, and 7th floor set back penthouse per drawings dated
7/28/17 is approved as proposed given the property’s context along
Carroll which has several similarly scaled buildings. The elevator/stair
enclosure to the rooftop deck above the 7th floor has also been reduced
in size to minimize its visibility from the street;
b) The new 21’-wide curb-cut proposed along Carroll Street to access the
two-way ramp for below ground-parking is approved as curb-cuts in

c) The recessed terraces at the 5th-7th floors are approved as proposed,

Engobe produced by Morin Brick) are approved.
4. 456 W. Belden
43rd Ward
Mid-North District
Proposed rehabilitation of existing masonry single-family residence including new
masonry corner garage with roof deck.
Action:

monumentality at the pedestrian level;
2. Mullions for proposed paired basement windows match dimensions of
historic;
3. Window details for the safety glass replacement be provided with

connections shall be concealed underground or within the sign or
base and the illumination shall be dimmable;
2. As proposed the images on the digital screens shall display static
images only. The permit application documents shall identify how

waterstruck” brick and Indiana limestone detailing is approved as
proposed. The mortar should match the color of the face brick. Brick,
limestone, and mortar samples shall be submitted to Historic
Preservation staff prior to permit submittal;
3. The rooftop penthouse cladding is proposed to be fiber cement lap
siding. Fiber cement siding is to be a smooth finish, maintain a 4” lap
exposure, and have a neutral/dark color to minimize visibility. Any
rooftop feature and/or planting/ landscaping on the roof decks should
be set back and low in height so as not to be visible from the public

Miscellaneous

Zoning review only; Drawings in support of a zoning exception for parking
in a TOD zone; current use is mercantile; new use is child care center.
The project as proposed would require a zoning variation and/or
adjustment, and the Commission takes no position regarding any requested
variance/adjustment relative to the zoning code requirements. Additionally,
the scope of work does not include work to the "exterior faces of the
structures and all the streetscapes and landscapes" within the district
which are the protected features of the Wicker Park District so no proposed
work has been reviewed under Commission standards and guidelines.
