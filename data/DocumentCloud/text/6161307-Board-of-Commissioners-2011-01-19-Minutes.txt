we are presenting the following Grade 24 adjustments:

73

 TABLE OF CONTENTS FOR JANUARY 19, 2011

Oak Forest Hospital Deputy Director
Shirley Bomar-Cole
$125,313.76 - $131,579.44
Effective 10/10/10
Promotion: This equity adjustment was based on an assignment to Oak Forest Hospital in
2005. Ms. Cole was part of an interim team and promised a raise if made permanent. The
position was made permanent but she never received the promised increase.
Oak Forest Hospital, Provident Hospital and ACHN Chief Financial Officer
John Cookinham
$125,000.00- $165,000.00
Effective 06/12/10

years ago and also reflects expanded System responsibilities.
Oak Forest Hospital Associate Administrator
Thomas Dohm
$88,949.12 - $114,093.00
Effective 10/10/10
Re-classification: This reflects a promotion to Associate Administrator and was part of the
realignment at Oak Forest Hospital. The new organizational structure at Oak Forest
Hospital presents a savings.
System Chief Psychologist
Rocco Domanico
$85,467.20 - $95,382.56
Effective 07/19/10
Promotion: This reflects a promotion to Vice Chair of the Department of Psychiatry,
assisting the Chair in the general oversight, direction, and management for the Department.
Oak Forest Hospital Chief Operating Officer
Sylvia Edwards
$156,526.24 - $161,120.96
Effective 10/10/10
Promotion: An equity adjustment was given based on a comparison between the position
of Chief Operating Officers at both Provident and Oak Forest Hospitals. It was determined
that the Chief Operating Officer at Oak Forest Hospital was performing the same job as the
Chief Operating Officer of Provident Hospital but at lower pay rate.
System Director of Talent Management
Gina Goodson-Allen
$100,000.00 - $120,000.00
Effective 10/24/10
Promotion: This individual applied for the position of System Director of Talent
Management. She was promoted from Nurse Recruiter to this new position with
responsibility for all recruiting including Taleo.

Ruth M. Rothstein Core Center Pharmacist Manager

74

 TABLE OF CONTENTS FOR JANUARY 19, 2011

Richard Grant
$129,538.24 - $134,706.00

The adjustments to the Grade 24 positions will be funded from the 110 Account. Pursuant
to Resolution 09-R-526 the System Board has authority to transfer funds in and out of the
100 Services Accounts (Personal Services), therefore the above adjustments are within the
Cook County Health & Hospitals System FY2010 appropriation.
The Cook County Health & Hospitals System Board of Directors reviewed the above

related development initiatives to ensure the successful implementation of the CCHHS
strategy, improve caregiver/employee satisfaction and develop a robust program for inservice education and professional skill building. This position supports Strategic Plan

pharmacy for the company currently under contract to provide services to our patients. The

million annually. Available Market Data indicates a median salary for a position of this

WHEREAS, Cook County has defined abandoned property as a building and other structures that, after
having been vacant and unused for at least 24 months, are purchased for value by a purchaser in whom
the seller has no direct financial interest; and
WHEREAS, in the instance where the property does not meet the definition of abandoned property, the

and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners has determined that the building was abandoned
