Port of Cleveland during the period 11-15 July 2019. An important reminder remains that
July 11, 2019 is the Thursday immediately following the 2019 MLB All Star Game
(July 9, 2019) at Progressive Field in downtown Cleveland. There will be a great deal of
activity in the maritime domain along the Cuyahoga River and Lake Erie,
respectively) during this entire week long time frame.

The Mid-Period Planning Conference for Incident Action Flaming for the 2019
Tall Ships Challenge will be held at USCG MSU Cleveland on Thursday, April 18, 2019
immediately after the NEORAMSS Executive Board meeting. It is expected that the
MPC will start around 12 noon with a planned end at approximately 2 pm.

The Eastern Great Lakes Area Maritime Security Plan is undergoing a five
year update/revision which is expected to be completed mid to late 2019. NEORAMSS is
requesting assistance in providing input, information, comment, etc. during the update
process related to Northeast Ohio area maritime security issues and risks and threats
associated thereto. Volunteers are requested for this review and revision effort. Please
contact the NEORAMSS leadership, Chairman Bob Kollar, Vice Chairman Bryan Kloss

revisions. We cannot complete this revision reasonably without the support from the
affected community.
