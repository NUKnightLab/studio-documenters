Safe Opioid Prescribing Committee
A Partnership with Patients at CCH
Best practices guidelines by CDC/JC for chronic pain management:
• Standardizing and providing opioid medication agreement to all patients being prescribed
• Verifying and documenting ILPMP website on each visit
• Prescribing small opioid quantities and frequent visits initially
• Obtaining opioids from a single pharmacy
• Performing urine drug testing when needed
• Documenting risk and functional improvement
• Avoiding the combination of sedatives and opioids
• Prescribing Naloxone for opioid prescriptions >50 MME
