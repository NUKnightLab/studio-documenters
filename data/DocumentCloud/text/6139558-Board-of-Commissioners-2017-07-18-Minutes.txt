COMMEMORATING UNITY PARK ADVISORY COUNCIL’S 30TH ANNIVERSARY
WHEREAS, in the early 1950s, a fire ravaged the homes on the 2600 block of Kimball Avenue. Following
the demolition of the remaining structures, the lot was turned into a parking lot for businesses at the corner
of Diversey, Milwaukee and Kimball Avenues; and
WHEREAS, time passed and the nearby businesses shuttered, the lot was no longer needed, becoming an
impromptu play area for the neighborhood’s children; and
WHEREAS, in the 1970s, residents demanded the City of Chicago donate a portion of the lot to the
Chicago Park District. With community organizing, planning and help from Logan Square Neighborhood
Association, the City of Chicago granted these neighbors their request. Playlot 293 was created with just a
sandbox and basic play equipment; and

13

 Board of Commissioners

Journal of Proceedings

July 18, 2017

WHEREAS, in 1986, as children flocked to the playlot, parents’ and neighbors’ concerns grew about the
concrete being too rough for kids to play on safely, but so too did the need for an actual playground; and
WHEREAS, during this time, Manuel Guillot of Logan Square Neighborhood Association was walking
door-to-door to speak with residents about improvements they were interested in pursuing. Through this
outreach, Mr. Guillot encountered Mr. Joel Monarch who would later become Unity Park Advisory
Council’s co-founder and co-chair; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Guillot and Mr. Monarch began inviting neighbors to a community meeting and through
this gathering, ‘Parents for a Decent Playlot’ was created; and
WHEREAS, this group of seven (7) residents, fought for nearly half a year with the Chicago Park District
to have the playlot rehabbed. In June 1987, after protests and contentious community meetings, the concrete
was replaced by a soft surface and fresh landscaping which was part of the City’s pilot program to overhaul
300 playlots across Chicago; and
WHEREAS, with the unveiling of the new playlot came a new name, Unity Playlot Park and in 1993 Unity
Park Advisory Council received their official advisory council status. Since then, Unity Park Advisory
Council has held meetings on a monthly basis and has seen four expansions of the park. Unity Park now
has an incredible community base and offers activities and events, together with Chicago Park District such
as April’s Earth Day Clean-Up and Planting, July’s “Art in the Park”, an August movie and October’s
signature “PumpkinFest” which are all funded by the council’s annual fundraisers.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and Cook County Board, issue a
proclamation that all of the citizens of Cook County acknowledge and congratulate Unity Park Advisory
Council members and volunteers for their committed, purposeful and philanthropic community
contributions during these past thirty years. Unity Park Advisory Council will be celebrating their 30th
Year Anniversary on Friday, June 16, 2017; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that this text be spread upon the official proceedings of this Honorable
Body, and an official copy of the same be presented to Unity Park Advisory Council to commemorate this
milestone event.

HONORING FATHER DOMINIC GRASSI ON THE OCCASION OF HIS RETIREMENT
WHEREAS, Father Dominic Grassi, pastor, teacher, counselor, coach, retreat and vocation director,
inspirational speaker, editor and popular writer said his final mass in June at Saint Gertrude Parish of
Chicago. For over eleven years he was a treasured priest and leader of the faith community at St. Gerts, a
congregation that under Father Dom made certain that all who came felt welcome. On his watch he made
certain that their motto “All Are Welcome” truly became a reality, and
WHEREAS, Father Dominic Grassi’s family emigrated from Southern Italy. His father and uncle opened
a grocery store, and by the time Dominic was born, they had one of the largest grocery stores in the city.
His mother was famous for her extraordinary cooking; and
WHEREAS, as a child, Dominic Grassi’s family modeled strong values of multiculturalism decades before
the term became commonly used. He grew up as a member of the only Italian family in a neighborhood

appreciation of people’s differences; he became a compassionate listener and advocate; and
WHEREAS, Dominic Grassi was the third of his three (3) older brothers to attend the seminary before him
but he was the only one (1) of the three (3) to finish seminary. He attended the college seminary, which

Loyola. He received an undergraduate degree in literature. While he was a seminary student, the country
was in the midst of deep turmoil. During the 1960’s the country was involved in the Vietnam War and the
struggles surrounding the civil rights movement, among others. These events had a formative impact on
his world view; he was ordained in 1973; and
WHEREAS, in childhood, Dominic Grassi attended school near a large public library; reading became a
very important past-time for him. A great reader grew into a great writer later in life. He became a
popular author, his books include: Bumping into God, Bumping into God Again, Bumping into God in the
Kitchen, and Still Called by Name, and the coauthor of Living the Mass; and
WHEREAS, Father Dominic Grassi has always had and will always have the backs of those who are
marginalized for any reason. As the youngest child in his family and being an Italian-American priest at
time when non-Irish priests were marginalized, he had an acute familiarity with how it felt to be forced to
the sidelines; and
WHEREAS, Father Dom’s first assignment as a priest was in the African American community. He later
went into teaching. He was part of the Industrial Areas Foundation, Saul Alinsky’s group, and he was a
major force in the social justice movement. He maintained his advocacy for worker’s rights and a living

wage throughout his career as an educator and pastor, most recently with the hospitability employees at
Loyola University; and
WHEREAS, Father Dominic Grassi’s abilities singled him out for distinction and he has often been
honored for his exceptional contributions. He was awarded the St Pope John XXII award from the
Association of Chicago Priests. The award is given to a priest for excellence in priestly ministry and for
significant contribution to the life of the Church of Chicago. In 2012, he received the Distinguished Pastor
Award from the National Catholic Educational Association, as pastor of Northside Catholic Academy; and
WHEREAS, in retirement, Father Dominic Grassi will likely continue to write, give retreats, advocate for
people on the margins of society and provide a sympathetic ear, wise counsel and great Italian cooking for
all whom he encounters.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County, on behalf
of the 5.2 million residents of Cook County takes great pleasure in honoring and celebrating the hard work,
accomplishments and exceptional career of Father Dominic Grassi and herewith expresses its sincere

 Board of Commissioners

Journal of Proceedings

July 18, 2017

WHEREAS, in 1982, Carlos Tortolero organized a group of fellow educators and founded the Mexican
Fine Arts Center Museum, which opened its doors in 1987; and
WHEREAS, the Mexican Fine Arts Center Museum aimed to fill a void in Chicago: the lack of a place to
present Mexican art and history and to celebrate the culture so vital to the Pilsen neighborhood, Chicago's
Mexican community, and the city at large; and
WHEREAS, the goal was to establish an arts and cultural organization committed to accessibility,
education and social justice all while also providing a positive influence for the local Mexican community,
especially since many other art institutions did not address Mexican art; and
WHEREAS, over the years, the institution has grown, its audience has broadened, and its reach now
extends across the United States and beyond; and
WHEREAS, to support this evolution, in 2001, the museum expanded to a 48,000 square-foot, state-ofthe-art facility in the heart of Pilsen and in 2006 they unveiled a new name, the National Museum of
Mexican Art (NMMA); and
WHEREAS, while the NMMA presence has grown, it remain true to the founding mission: To showcase
the beauty and richness of Mexican culture by sponsoring events and presenting exhibitions that exemplify
the majestic variety of visual and performing arts in the Mexican culture; to develop, conserve and preserve
a significant permanent collection of Mexican art; to encourage the professional development of Mexican
artists; and, to offer arts-education programs; and
WHEREAS, today, the NMMA stands out as one of the most prominent first-voice institutions for Mexican
art and culture in the United States and is home to one of the country’s largest Mexican art collections,
including more than 10,000 seminal pieces from ancient Mexico to the present; and
WHEREAS, as the first Latino museum accredited by American Alliance of Museums, the NMMA
recognizes the unique responsibility to present exhibitions of artistic and cultural value and to deliver highquality education that demonstrates the breadth and depth of Mexican art, culture and history; and
WHEREAS, twenty of the NMMA’s exhibitions have traveled across the United States and six have
traveled to Mexico. Landmark exhibitions that have traveled include The Art of the Other Mexico (1992),
Maria Izquierdo (1996), The African Presence in Mexico (2006), and Frida's Contemporaries: Women
Artists of Modern Mexico (2007); and
WHEREAS, the NMMA also hosts cultural programs- including symposia, theater, dance, music, authors
and performance companies- that share the rich diversity of the Mexican culture; and
WHEREAS, the NMMA believes in art as a bridge between communities, and that art in education expands
minds and breaks down barriers while preserving cultural heritage; and
WHEREAS, the NMMA offers a wide range of educational programs for children and families, teens,
school groups, and educators and its art exhibitions, performance arts, and educational programs are
experienced by more than 130,000 visitors annually, including 58,000 K-12 students; and
35

 Board of Commissioners

Journal of Proceedings

July 18, 2017

WHEREAS, the NMMA is also a national leader and mentor for cultural institutions and community
organizations, and for its advocacy of “first voice” and cultural equity issues; and
WHEREAS, from building a world-class institution in Chicago’s largely Mexican American neighborhood
of Pilsen to creating groundbreaking exhibitions and forming partnerships with institutions in Mexico, the
NMMA has a history of being bold and activist in its approach and reach.
NOW, THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners hereby
congratulates the National Museum of Mexican Art (NMMA) on its 30-year legacy and anniversary; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that this text be spread upon the proceedings of this Honorable Body
and that a suitable copy of this Resolution be presented to the National Museum of Mexican Art (NMMA).

HONORING THE REDEDICATION OF EBENEZER PRIMM TOWERS IN EVANSTON, AND
HONORING THE LEGACY OF REVEREND JACOB S. BLAKE
WHEREAS, Ebenezer Primm Towers was the first church sponsored federally funded housing project in
a major suburban area. It will be rededicated on Sunday, July 30, 2017. At its rededication, the community
will honor the Reverend Jacob S. Blake’s pivotal role in making Ebenezer Primm Towers a reality and the
powerful legacy of Reverend Blake and Ebenezer African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church; and
WHEREAS, for decades, prior to arriving in Evanston, Reverend Blake was a leader and a major force for
good in the region battling profound injustices, such as redlining, housing discrimination, education
inequity and busing. In Evanston, in addition to so many other issues, he worked tirelessly to establish
affordable housing for the senior citizens in Evanston, where rents were rising rapidly. The result was the
establishment of Ebenezer Primm Towers, which has a proud history that is a reflection of Reverend Blake
and his intense determination and strong leadership; and
WHEREAS, Ebenezer Primm Towers came about in an unprecedented real estate deal with Northwestern
University. Reverend Blake and Ebenezer AME Church purchased land owned by the university at 25%
below market value for $75,000.00. According to university officials, Northwestern sold the land to the
church to foster good community relations and to dispel the notion that the university only expanded in
black communities. The Northwestern Black Student Union, the Black Ensemble of Northwestern and the
African American Community in Evanston put pressure on the University to sell the land. But there was a
catch to the deal, if construction didn’t start within 24 months of the sale, Northwestern University could
buy the property back. With the clock ticking, funds were raised via several sources. The church got a loan
to buy the land and received a grant from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development
43

to help finance the $500,000.00 construction project. The rest was raised by the community that pulled
together to make the dream a reality; and
WHEREAS, Joseph Levy, owner of a Buick car dealership at the time, donated a brand new Buick to be
auctioned off to raise money for the project. The church held fundraisers which included selling dinners,
hosting basketball tournaments and at the Ebenezer AME Church 90th Anniversary Gala. To ensure that
housing for the elderly remained a priority in Evanston, John Young, Urban Planner of Evanston at the time
worked with a committee to create a special zoning district for that purpose. Ebenezer Primm Towers was
dedicated July 1973 and residents moved in soon after.
WHEREAS, Reverend Blake’s widow Patricia G. Blake and sons Justin S. Blake and Jacob S. Blake Jr.
will be in attendance at the rededication of Ebenezer Primm Towers along with members of Ebenezer AME
Church, other family members and friends; the community will honor Reverend Jacob S. Blake’s crucial
role in making Ebenezer Primm Towers a reality.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County, on behalf
of the 5.2 million residents of Cook County takes great pleasure in honoring and celebrating the rededication
