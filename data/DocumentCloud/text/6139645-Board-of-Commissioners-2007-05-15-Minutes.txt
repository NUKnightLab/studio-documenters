Submitting a Resolution for approval on the May I, 2007 Board agenda. The Resolution decl ares Cook
County a " Fair and Equal County for Immigrants" and prohibits county employees, including police
officers, from demanding proof of immigration status during routine interactions. It ensures that all county
residents have fair and equal access to our governmenf s services, opportunities, and protections. In
addi tion, to the extent a llowed by law, the Resolution prevents county employees from assisting with
federal immigration enforcement, such as reporting suspected undocumented immigrants to authorities.

recommended changes have been incorporated.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION

RESOLUTION DECLARING COOK COUNTY A
"FAIR AND EQUAL COUNTY FOR IMMIGRANTS"
WHEREAS, the County of Cook is a home rule unit of local government pursuant to Article VII, Section
6(a) of the 1970 lllinois Constitution; and
WHEREAS, pursuant to its home rule power, the County of Cook may exercise any power and perform
any function relating to its government and affairs including the power to regulate for the protection of the
public hea lth, safety, morals, and welfare; and
WHEREAS, to this end, the County of Cook is dedicated to providing a ll of its residents with fair and
equal access to the services, opportunities, and protection county government has been established to
administer; and
WHEREAS, there are now approximately 12 mi llion undocumented immigrants in the United States,
including half a million in Illinois and more than 300,000 who live in communities throughout Cook
County, working full-time jobs, paying taxes, and contributing to Social Security and Medicare; and
WHEREAS, conditioning the provision of benefits, opportunities, and services on citizensh ip or immigrant
status or inquiring about such status in the course of such provi sion directly contravenes the County's
commitment to ensuring fair and equal access for all of its residents; and
WHEREAS, the enforcement of civil immigration laws has historically been a federa l government
responsibi lity, a power vested first in the Immigration and Naturalization Service and then in the
Department of Ho meland Security; and
WHEREAS, initiatives such as the proposed Federal Clear Law Enforcement for Criminal Alien Removal
Act, which would require local governments to give their local law enforcement agencies express authority
to enforce immigration laws, also signals pressure to expend limited local resources on traditionally federa l
functions; and
WHEREAS, encouraging local governments that are not specifically equipped or trained to implement
immigration measures is likely to result in inconsistencies and decentralization that undermine instead of
strengthen these measures; and
WHEREAS, as a matter of public safety, the protection of an individual ' s c itizenship and immigrant status
will engender trust and cooperation between law enforcement officials and immigrant communities to aid
in crime prevention and solving, including human and drug trafficking, prostitution, domestic violence, and
even terrorism, and will discourage the threat of immigrant and racial profi ling and harassment; and

1636

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 1, 2007

WHEREAS, according to the National Immigration Law Center, nearly 50 cities and counties throughout
the U.S. have enacted " Sanctuary Laws", prohibiting their agencies from inquiring about immigration
status and unilaterally enforcing immigration law provisions including Cambridge, Chicago, Los Angeles,
and Seattle and several states, including Alaska, Maine and Oregon; and
WHEREAS, by means of this resolution, Cook County joins states, cities, and counties across the nation
by declaring itself a "Fair and Equal County for Immigrants", which means that Cook County ensures fair
and equal access to essential benefits, opportunities, and services by prohibiting Cook County bureaus,
offices, departments, or employees or other Cook County agencies or agents from inquiring or disclosing
information about immigration status.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that except as provided below or when otherwise required by
law, no Cook County bureau, office, department, employee, or other Cook County agency or agent shall
condition the provi sion of Cook County benefits, opportunities, or services on matters related to citizenship
or immigrant status; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that it shall be the policy of the Cook County Sherifrs Office not to
assist in the investigation of the citizenship or immigrant status of any person unless such inquiry or
investigation is (a) integrally related to an investigation by the Cook County Sheriff s Office regarding a
matter other than the individua l's citizenship or immigrant status, such as criminal smuggling and
harboring of immigrants, or other crimes that have as an element of the crime the illegality of a person's
presence, or (b) as otherwise required by Jaw. The Cook County Sheriff s Office shall not make inquiries
into immigration status for the sole purpose of determining whether an individual has violated the civi l
immigration laws; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that except when otherwise required by Jaw, no Cook County bureau,
office, department, or e mployee or other Cook County agency or agent shall disclose information regarding
the citizenship or immigrant status of any person unless required to do so by law or such disclosure has
been authorized in writing by the individual to whom such information pertains, or if such individual is a
minor or is otherwise not legally competent, by such individual 's parent or guardian; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Bureau of Health Services (CCBH) shall not
condition the provision of health benefits, opportunities, or services on matters related to citizenship or
immigrant status, but may, in the course of determining eligibility for benefits or seeking reimbursement
fro m state, federal , or other third party payers, inquire about immigrant status for the sole purpose of such a
determination or receipt of reimbursement from said sources and, to such extent as the disclosure of such
information is related to such a determination or receipt of reimbursement, the provisions of this Resolution
and any subsequent ordinance do not apply to the CCBH; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that except when othe rwise required by law, where presentation of an
Illinois driver's license or identification card is accepted as adequate evidence of identity, presentation of a
photo ide ntity doc ument issued by the pe rson 's nation of origin, suc h as a driver's license, passport, or
matricula consular (consulate-issued document) shall be accepted and shall not subject the person to a
higher level of scrutiny or different treatment than if the person had provided an Illinois driver's license or
identification card except that this provision does not apply to the completion of the federally mandated 1-9
forms provided, however, that a request for translation of such document to English shall not be deemed a
violation of any provision of thi s Resolution and any subsequent ordinance; and

1637

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY I , 2007

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that this Resolution does not create or form the basis for liability on the
part of the County, its agents, or agencies. The exclusive remedy for violation of this Resolution shall be
through the County's disciplinary procedures for officers and employees under regulations including, but
not limited to, County personnel rules, union contracts, civil service commission rules, or any other agency
rules and/or regulations. Any person alleging a violation of this Resolution shall forward a complaint to the
Cook County Office of the Inspector General (" Inspector General") who shall process it in accordance with
the complaint-processing procedures established in the Cook County Code (Vol. I, Ch. 2, Art. IV, Div. 5,
Sec. 2-285); and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that any applications, questionnaires and interview forms used in
relation to Cook County benefits, opportunities or services shall be promptly reviewed by the pertinent
agencies, and any questions requiring disclosure of information related to citizenship or immigrant status,
other than those (a) permitted by thi s Resolution to require the disclosure of such information or (b)
otherwise required by law, shall be, in the best judgment of the pertinent agency, either deleted in its
entirety or revised such that the disclosure is no longer required. Such review and revision shall be
completed within ninety (90) days of the passage of this Resolution.

requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with Mothers Against Drunk

the consequences of their behavior. Due to budget reductions, the number of panel s in the
proposed contract will be reduced to forty-two (42) from fifty-six (56) under the current
contract.
MADD is a not-for-profit organization of citizens, victims and survivors of accidents dedicated
to reducing drunk driving through public education and community service. MADD provides
the following services: counseling, financial aid, support services and assistance to law
enforcement agencies. MADD has been providing services on behalf of the Circuit Court of
Cook County since 1996.

118 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois.
Your Committee has considered the following items and upon adoption of this report, the recommendations
are as follows:
286262

OFFICE OF CAPITAL PLANNING AND POLICY, by Bruce Washington, Director,
transmitting a Communication, dated April 3, 2007:
transmitted herewith for your approval is a request for authorization for the Purchasing
Agent to advertise for bids for security services at the Hawthorne Warehouse. It is
respectfully requested that this Honorable Body approve this request.
Reason:

This building is currently partially occupied by the County Clerk's Office.
While other portions of the building are under construction, it is important that
the facility remain secure and that outside traffic be controlled. Security
services are recommended for the period July 1, 2007 through November 30,
2008.

Bond Issue (20000 Account).
Sufficient funds have been appropriated to cover this request.
*Referred to the Committee on Construction on 04/18/07.
Commissioner Silvestri inquired whether the Hawthorne Warehouse currently has security services.
Bruce Washington, Director, Office of Capital Planning and Policy, stated that there are two security
services at the Hawthorne Warehouse which the contract expires June of 2007. At this time the Office of
Capital Planning and Policy is requesting to enter into a contract for permanent security at the Hawthorne
Warehouse which will run from July 2007 through fiscal year 2008.

1714

No. 286262. The motion carried.

Body approve this request.
Reason:

Restoration Company, Contractor for the Cook County Building Exterior Renovation
Project. It is respectfully requested that this Honorable Body approve this req uest.

1715

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 1, 2007

Reason:

This change order provides for fire escape and terra cotta repairs that are
necessary to maintain the safe condition of the building. These conditions were
unforeseen and could not be identified until after the building was cleaned and
the embedded steel used for the fire escape bracing was exposed. A portion of
this work will be funded through a reallocation of unused allowances within the
contract. The remainder of the work will require a modification in the adjusted
contract amount. A time extension of 235 calendar days is requested for this
work.

OFFICE OF CAPITAL PLANNING AND POLICY, by Bruce Washington, Director,
transmitting a Communication:
transmitted herewith for your approval is Change Order No. 2 to the contract with Soodan
& Associates, Inc., Consultant for the Cook County Building Exterior Renovation Project.

It is respectfully requested that this Honorable Body approve this request.
Reason:

This change order provides for an extension of construction administration
services. Due to the County Building's age and the complexity of restoring the
fa<;:ade, the full length of services required could not be determined until after
the construction phase of the project had started and any possible unforeseen
conditions were exposed. Repairs to the fire escapes and the light court
masonry and terra cotta will be needed to maintain the safe condition of the
building, therefore extending the construction period and construction
administration phase an estimated fourteen months.

RESOLUTION FOR THE STAND AGAINST BREAST CANCER
WHEREAS, Breast Cancer is a significant health problem in Cook County, the State of Illinois and the
entire nation, it is the most common cancer among women and the second most deadly. Advances in
mammography screening and breast cancer treatment have benefited women ; and
WHEREAS, Breast Cancer detection is most valuable in the early stages of cancer, greater awareness of
the need for early mammograms and follow-up care can increase Breast Cancer survival rates for AfricanAmerican, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islanders, and Native American women in Cook County and across the
State of Illinois; and
WHEREAS, survival rates have improved in the last three decades but disparities in breast cancer survival
among minorities and whites has not declined due to cancer stage, lack of access to medical care, inferior
treatment, co-morbidities and lower socioeconomic status. The continuing disparities in cancer mortality
rates are disturbing; and
WHEREAS, more programs are needed to remove ban-iers both cultural and economic that prevent
minority women from obtaining the regular health examinations that assure the early diagnosis of Breast
Cancer; and
WHEREAS, the Access Community Health Network has launched the Stand Against Breast Cancer
program to work with churches and parishes across the State of Illinois urging its member churches in the
Chicago-area to participate in a breast cancer awareness effort called "Pin-a-Sister Sunday" on Mother's
Day, May 13th encouraging women to seek mammograms and ensure follow-up care.

RESOLUTION HONORING PROJECT PURPLE: CHICAGO
WHEREAS, every two and a half minutes, somewhere in America, someone is sexually assaulted; and
WHEREAS, one in six American women are victims of sexual assault, and one in 33 men; and
WHEREAS, awareness is crucial in ending violence against women. The vast majority of sexual assaults
go unreported. Victims of sexual assaults and violence often face ridicule and skepticism when coming
forward, instead of receiving the attention they deserve. The traumatizing experience from an assault is
then followed by more fear and distress. Many must face this suffering completely alone; and
WHEREAS, it is not only the victims that keep silent. Society as a whole generally avoids openly
discussing sexual assault and violence, the silence encourages more violence. Hiding the truth and ignoring
the reality of violence results in a Jack of education, while fundraising for Violence Against Women
organizations becomes difficult, and loopholes in the Jaw which benefit attackers go unchallenged; and

WHEREAS, Project Purple sponsors free initiatives for both employees and employers including personal
safety workshops on how to spot an attacker; appropriate responses to both violent and non-violent
confrontations; proactive lifestyle choices to avoid dangerous situations altogether; and counseling
recommendations in the event of an attack; and
WHEREAS, Project Purple is organizing "SAFE & SOUND" events to generate awareness and raise
funds for local and national women's organizations where Chicago music hotspots will spin their turntables
for a good cause as Project Purple and its partners raise fund s for participating women 's organizations; and
WHEREAS, participating businesses will display the official Project Purple Awareness Flag, symbolizing
a safe Chicago; and
WHEREAS, Project Purple is a key initiative of the nationally recognized Prevention Purple Awareness
