 INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT

To the Board of Directors of
Chicago Infrastructure Trust
Chicago, Illinois

We have audited the accompanying financial statements of Chicago Infrastructure Trust (the
“CIT”), a nonprofit organization, which comprise the statement of financial position as of
December 31, 2016 and the related statements of activities and cash flows for the year then ended
and the related notes to the financial statements.
Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this
includes the design, implementation and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation
and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due
to fraud or error.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We
conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States
of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment,
including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether
due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control
relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to
design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. Accordingly, we express
no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used
and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis
for our audit opinion.

1

 Opinion
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of Chicago Infrastructure Trust as of December 31, 2016 and the changes
in its net assets and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.
Emphasis of Matter
As discussed in Notes 1 and 12 to the financial statements, the 2015 financial statements have been
restated due to omission, in the original 2015 financial statements, of the assets, liabilities and
operations of the Retrofit One project. Our opinion is not modified with respect to that matter.
Report on Summarized Comparative Information
We have previously audited the CIT’s 2015 financial statements, and we expressed an unmodified
audit opinion on those financial statements in our report dated October 18, 2016. In our opinion,
the summarized comparative information presented herein as of and for the year ended December
31, 2015, as restated, is consistent, in all material respects, with the audited financial statements
from which it has been derived.

 CHICAGO INFRASTRUCTURE TRUST
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016
NOTE 1 – NATURE OF ACTIVITIES
Organization: The Chicago Infrastructure Trust (the "CIT") was incorporated as a non-profit
organization on April 24, 2012 under executive order of the Mayor and City Council resolution. The
CIT operates exclusively for civic and charitable purposes in the Chicago Metropolitan area and is a
tax exempt entity pursuant to Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. The CIT assists the
people of the City of Chicago, the City government and its sister agencies in providing alternative
financing and project delivery options for transformative infrastructure projects.
The CIT was established in 2012 under the support of the City of Chicago, who agreed to supply the
funding to commence operations. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 grants from the
City of Chicago were the CIT’s primary source of revenues in exchange for services rendered for the
City of Chicago.
In 2014, the CIT entered into agreements with multiple parties to facilitate the Retrofit One project to
provide Energy efficiency Conservation Measures (ECM) in more than 60 municipal buildings. The
City of Chicago (City), per the terms of an Energy Services Agreement (ESA) between the City and
the CIT, agreed to make payments to the CIT equivalent to the actualized utility cost savings
achieved by the project. Further, the energy savings of the project are guaranteed by the Contractors
responsible for the installation of the Energy Conservation Measures, as evidenced by Guaranteed
Energy Performance Contracts (GEPCs) executed by the contractors and the CIT. The Retrofit One
project was financed through a loan and security agreement, as detailed in Note 7. The Retrofit One
financing is a special, limited obligation of the CIT, secured only by project specific revenues and
equipment with debt service obligations sized to the project’s guaranteed energy cost savings.
Per the agreements, the CIT will retain title to all the Energy Conservation Measures through the
term of the loan and security agreement.
In the originally issued financial statements for 2014 and 2015 CIT did not include the assets,
liabilities, and operations of the Retrofit One project. In 2016, it was determined that such operations
are appropriately a part of the CIT’s financial statements. Accordingly, the 2015 financial statements
have been restated to include such operations. See note 12 for the effect of such restatement.
NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Accounting: The financial statements of the CIT have been prepared on the accrual basis of
accounting and, accordingly, reflect all significant receivables, payables and other liabilities.

 CHICAGO INFRASTRUCTURE TRUST
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016
NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - Continued
Basis of Presentation: The CIT presents its financial statements in accordance with the accounting
guidance for nonprofit entities. Under this guidance, the CIT is required to report information
regarding its financial position and activities according to three classes of net assets: unrestricted net
assets, temporarily restricted net assets, and permanently restricted net assets. Furthermore,
information is required to segregate program service expenses from support and fundraising
expenses.
Use of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents: The CIT considers cash on deposit at bank(s) to be cash equivalents.
Investments: Investments are presented in the financial statements at fair value in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Investments in securities
traded on a national securities exchange, or reported on the NASDAQ national market, are stated at
the last reported sales price on the day of valuation; other securities traded in the over the counter
market and listed securities for which no sale was reported on that date are stated at the last quoted
bid price. Realized and unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value of
securities held are reflected in the statement of activities, in the year of change.
The CIT may invest in various investments. Such investments are exposed to various risks, such as
interest rate, market, and credit risks. Due to the level of risk associated with certain investments, it
is at least reasonably possible that changes in the values of investments will occur in the near term
and that such changes could materially affect the amounts reported in the statement of activities.
The CIT had no investments at December 31, 2016.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments: FASB Guidance, Fair Value Measurement Overall Disclosure,
requires the CIT to disclose estimated fair values for its financial instruments. Fair value estimates,
methods, and assumptions are set forth below for the CIT’s financial instruments.
The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, other assets approximate fair value due
to the short maturity of these instruments.

YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016
NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - Continued
Revenue Recognition: Grants received are recorded as unrestricted, temporarily restricted or
permanently restricted support, depending on the existence and/or nature of any donor restrictions.
Conditional promises to give are not recognized until they become unconditional: that is, when the
conditions on which they depend are substantially met. Service revenues are recognized at project
completion.
Grants Receivable: Receivables are reported net of an allowance for doubtful accounts, if any.
Management's estimate of the allowance is based on historical collection experience and a review of
the current status of grants receivable. It is reasonably possible that management's estimate of the
allowance will change. There was no allowance against grants receivable at December 31, 2016.
Capitalization and depreciation: Fixed assets are recorded at cost. Improvements are capitalized,
while expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed. The assets are depreciated over their
estimated service lives. The estimated service lives of the assets for depreciation purposes may be
different than their actual economic useful lives.

Interest during the ECM construction period was capitalized. For the year ended December 31,
2015, interest in the amount of $1,119,659 was capitalized.
Impairment of long-lived assets: The CIT reviews its property for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. If the
fair value is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized for the
difference. No impairment losses were recognized during 2016 and 2015.
Prepaid Expenses: Advance payments for expenses related to subscriptions and insurance policies
are classified as prepaid expenses.
Net Assets: The CIT classifies its net assets, and support based on the existence or absence of donorimposed restrictions as follows:
Unrestricted net assets: Net assets that are not subject to donor-imposed stipulations.

8

 CHICAGO INFRASTRUCTURE TRUST
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016
NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - Continued
Temporarily restricted net assets: Net assets represent resources for which use has been
temporarily restricted by the donor as to its usage or by the passage of time. When a donor
restriction has been satisfied, temporarily restricted net assets are reclassified to unrestricted
net assets.
Permanently restricted net assets: Net assets represent resources that are limited by donorimposed stipulations that neither expire by passage of time nor can be fulfilled or otherwise
removed by actions of the CIT. The CIT had no permanently restricted net assets during the
years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.
Leases: Lease expenses are recorded based on the payments required by the lease agreement.
Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that the lease
payments be straight-lined over the life of the lease; however, the effect of using actual lease
payments is not materially different from the results that would have been obtained under the
straight-line method.
Income Taxes: The CIT has applied for and received a determination letter from the Internal
Revenue Service ("IRS") to be treated as a tax exempt entity pursuant to Section 501(c)(3) of the
Internal Revenue Code and did not have any unrelated business income for the years ended
December 31, 2016 and 2015. Due to its tax exempt status, the CIT is not subject to income taxes,
but is required to file and does file tax returns with the IRS and other taxing authorities. Accordingly,
these financial statements do not reflect a provision for income taxes and the CIT has no other tax
positions which must be considered for disclosure. Income tax returns filed by the CIT are subject to
examination by the Internal Revenue Service for a period of three years. While no tax returns are
currently being examined by the Internal Revenue Service, tax years since 2013 remain open.
Comparative Financial Information: The financial statements include prior-year summarized
comparative information. Such information does not include sufficient data to constitute a
presentation in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. Accordingly, such
information should be read in conjunction with the CIT's financial statements for the year ended
December 31, 2015, as restated, from which the summarized information was derived.
Functional Allocation of Expenses: The costs of providing various programs and other activities
have been summarized on a functional basis in the Statement of Activities. Accordingly, certain
costs have been allocated among the programs benefited, as well as administrative functions.
Debt Issuance Costs, Adoption of ASU 2015 03: In 2016, the CIT retroactively adopted the
requirements in FASB ASC 835-30 to present debt issuance costs as a reduction of the carrying
amount of the related debt rather than as an asset. Amortization of the debt issuance costs is reported
as interest expense in the statement of activities.

NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - Continued
Reclassifications: Certain amounts in the December 31, 2015 Financial Statements have been
reclassified to conform to the current presentation.
NOTE 3 – CASH DEPOSITS
The CIT maintains its cash and cash equivalents in bank deposits and is insured within limits of the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. At certain times during the year, cash balances exceed the
insured amounts. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the uninsured bank balance was $872,800 and
$740,607, respectively. The CIT has not experienced any losses in such accounts. The CIT’s
management believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk on cash and cash equivalents.
NOTE 4 – INVESTMENTS
Investments consist of Prime Money Market Funds and are reported at fair value as noted in Note 5.
The investment funds are required to be maintained in separate accounts and restricted for the
construction of assets outlined in an agreement dated April 11, 2014. See Note 1 for additional
information.
NOTE 5 – FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability
in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and sets out a fair
value hierarchy. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets
for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3).
Inputs are broadly defined as assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or
liability. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:
Level 1: Valuations for assets and liabilities traded in active exchange markets, such as the
New York Stock Exchange. Level 1 also includes U.S. Treasury and federal agency securities
and federal agency mortgage backed securities, which are traded by dealers or brokers in
active markets. Valuations are obtained from readily available pricing sources for market
transactions involving identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: Valuations for assets and liabilities traded in less active dealer or broker markets.
Valuations are obtained from third party pricing services for identical or similar assets or
liabilities.

10

 CHICAGO INFRASTRUCTURE TRUST
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016
NOTE 5 – FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS - Continued
Level 3: Valuations for assets and liabilities that are derived from other valuation
methodologies, including options pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar
techniques, and not based on market exchange, dealer, or broker traded transactions. Level 3
valuations incorporate certain assumptions and projections in determining the fair value
assigned to such assets or liabilities.
In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value
hierarchy. In such cases, an investment’s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest
level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Organization’s assessment of the
significance of a particular input to the fair measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and
considers factors specific to the investment.
The CIT assesses the levels of the investments at each measurement date, and transfers between
levels are recognized on the actual date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the
transfer in accordance with the CIT’s accounting policy regarding the recognition of transfers
between levels of the fair value hierarchy. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, there
were no such transfers.
The following table presents the CIT’s investments accounted for at fair value as of December 31,
2015 using the fair value hierarchy:

July 31, 2017, for office space at 35 East Wacker Drive, Suite 1450, Chicago, Illinois in the amount
of $2,558 per month plus certain occupancy costs, which escalates annually on August 1. Rent
expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 totaled $40,213 and $32,661,
respectively.
Equipment: The CIT also leases office equipment under one operating lease for total annual lease
payments of $6,624 and one capital lease, both with initial lease terms in excess of one year.
