moving the Plan For Transformation forward.

five stated firms, through its broker of record, Near North Insurance Brokerage.

(Item A7)
In August 2003, the Authority advertised an Invitation For Bid in area newspapers for exterior
renovations at Kenmore Apartments. Additionally, 49 companies, including 13 MBE/WBE
firms, were directly solicited. Of the four bids received and open, FHP Tectonics was
determined to have submitted the lowest responsive and responsible bid. Accordingly, the
resolution for Item A7 approves award of contract to FHP Tectonics. As part of the CHA’s
Capital Improvement Program for Seniors, this contract is necessary to repair the exterior
envelope of the building at Kenmore Apartments.
RESOLUTION NO. 2003-CHA-137

(Item A8)
On April 8, 2003, at approximately 4:00 a.m., Lathrop Homes Development experienced a
major power outage causing a black-out throughout the development. Pursuant to the Lathrop
Homes Emergency Plan, ComEd and E-Z Electrical Services were immediately contacted to
provide temporary generators. E-Z Electrical Services was contacted because they had
previously performed electrical services at Lathrop and they were the most familiar with the
system. The resolution for Item A8 approves CHA’s existing obligation to E-Z Electrical for
emergency services rendered during the power outage, as well as covering the cost to purchase
four new transformers in order to minimize the possibility of future emergencies of this nature.
RESOLUTION NO. 2003-CHA138
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated August 28,
2003, titled, “Authorization to ratify the obligation and enter into a contract with

replace four (4) transformers and eliminate any additional collateral damage at the
Lathrop Homes Development, for a total expenditure of $740,252.64.

(Item A9)
The entire Robert Taylor redevelopment, including on and off-site redevelopment, calls for a
mixed-income, mixed-tenure community of approximately 2,388 units, of which approximately
794 will be targeted to public housing residents; approximately 665 will be affordable rental,
approximately 495 affordable homeownership, and approximately 434 rental will be market rate.
The financing plan for Robert Taylor Phase C-1 totals approximately $24.5 million. It is
contemplated that the City will transfer certain City-owned parcels necessary for the Robert
Taylor Phase C-1 development to the developer or its affiliate directly (as opposed to through
CHA). This will avoid CHA unnecessarily coming into the chain of title. It is anticipated that
the majority of the land for the first on-site phase, Phase A-1, will be ground leased to the
developer (or an affiliated owner entity), for 99 years, and that the single-family homeownership
sites will be conveyed in fee simple. Accordingly, the resolution for Item A9 approves
submission of a Disposition Application for the remainder of Robert Taylor, submit the MixedFinance Proposal to HUD and execute such other documents as necessary.
RESOLUTION NO. 2003-CHA-139
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated September 10,

Mixed Finance Proposal to HUD for the Robert Taylor Phase C-1 Off-site project

 (Item B2)
In March 2002, the Commissioners approved a Development Agreement with Lake Park
Crescent, LLC, and the development team selected for the Lake Park Crescent community. The
Agreement refers to supportive services whereby the parties acknowledged that the developer
may seek to initiate a social services program for the Lake Park Crescent Community. The
resolution for Item B2 approves award of contract to Employment and Employer Services to
provide the requisite supportive services to the Lake Park Crescent community. Case
management services will be specifically designed to address site specific criteria and the
barriers a family may face in meeting the criteria and thus enabling a family to potentially reside
in the community. Admission to the Lake Park Crescent community requires that each
household satisfy a work requirement, thereby making employment services the center of Lake
Park Crescent LLC’s supportive services plan.

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to negotiate and execute a contract with Lake Park Crescent I LLC, the
developer for Lake Park Crescent development, to provide supportive services, in

(Item B3)
As part of the Plan For Transformation, CHA residents will be required to move at least once.
Families are required to remain lese compliant during their tenure in subsidized housing and
staying current on utility bills is a crucial component. Outstanding utility bills have become an
impediment to successful tenancy and relocation. Accordingly, the CHA has been working with
ComEd/Exelon to create a program to provide assistance to families with outstanding utility
bills. The resolution for Item B3 authorizes the Chief Executive Officer to negotiate and enter
into an agreement with Com/Ed to implement the C.H.A.N.C.E. Program. Under this program,
an individual owing past due amounts to ComEd of $300 or more, as of August 1, 2003, will
have the opportunity to be relieved of up to 2/3 of the amount the individual owes as long as the
individual pays the remaining 1/3 within 120 days of enrollment in the program.
RESOLUTION NO. 2003-CHA-151

THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

The Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to negotiate and enter into an agreement with Commonwealth Edison,
the utility provider for CHA residents, to provide assistance with delinquent
electric bills, in an amount not to exceed $330,000, subject to HUD Approval.
