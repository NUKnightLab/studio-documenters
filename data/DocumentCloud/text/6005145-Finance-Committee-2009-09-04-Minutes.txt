Receive report on contingency plan for grants
Dr. Stephen Martin, Chief Operating Officer of the Cook County Department of Public Health, presented
a report on the contingency plan for grants received by the Cook County Department of Public Health.
Director O’Donnell noted that public preparedness funding has been reduced by ten (10) percent. She
asked whether there would be increased funding for H1N1 (swine flu) preparedness. Dr. Martin
responded affirmatively. He stated that they will receive funding for planning and other costs, however
the funding does not cover response costs.
Director Butler requested information providing a grand total and a schedule of which grants require
matching funds. Dr. Martin responded that this information would be provided in the upcoming month
when the Cook County Department of Public Health presents its annual report.
Kathi Braswell, of the Ruth M. Rothstein CORE Center of Cook County, provided a brief update on grant
activity. She stated that the State has restored all funding for the HIV program; this funding was
previously in jeopardy due to the State’s budget issues.
On the subject of whether a grant-funded program should remain in place if grant funds are decreased or
eliminated, Chairman Carvalho stated that if it is a good, population-based program, the program should
not automatically be cut.
Discussion took place on the subject of presenting an update on all System grants. Mr. Foley stated that
he would like to see a presentation for the rest of the System, similar to the presentation made by Dr.
Martin.
________________________________
Receive update from MedAssets on Revenue Cycle Project
Gretchen Ryan, Project Manager from MedAssets, presented an update on the revenue cycle project
(Attachment #1).
The Committee reviewed and discussed the information. Questions were raised with regard to the
credentialing of coders. Information was provided on the process of credentialing; Chairman Carvalho
noted that they need to make sure a retention program is in place, if the System provides for the training
and assists existing employees with the credentialing process.

Receive update from MedAssets on Revenue Cycle Project (continued)

Director Muñoz asked for a status report on the charge master, and inquired whether they are working on
leveling the prices across the System. Ms. Ryan responded that they are moving towards that goal to
standardize. She stated that information on the subject would be provided at the next update.
The subject of new Medicaid rules that will soon be implemented was discussed. Chairman Carvalho
explained that currently, Medicaid has soft-implemented a primary case management model for certain
categories of patients covered by Medicaid. Under this model, clinical homes are chosen by the patient,
and care provided outside of that clinical home is not reimbursed. Now Medicaid is going to implement
this model for all categories of patients covered by Medicaid as soon as February of 2010; if patients do
not choose a clinical home, they will be automatically assigned to one. Chairman Carvalho requested
information on how the System is preparing for this change.

and Hospitals System.

Receive update on Bills and Claims
Elizabeth Reidy, General Counsel of the Cook County Health and Hospitals System, provided an update
on the subject of the bills and claims that in the past have been submitted to the System Board for
approval. She asked the State’s Attorney’s Office for advice as to whether the System Board is required
to separately approve invoices for payment if the System Board has already approved the purchase to
which the invoices relate; and whether the System Board has to approve invoices for contracts under
$100,000 (supplies and equipment) or under $25,000 (professional services) where the contracts were
approved by the Chief Executive Officer.
The State’s Attorney concludes that neither the County’s Ordinance on Procurement and Contracting nor
the System’s Procurement Policy require that invoices against a contract approved by the System Board
or the Chief Executive Officer be approved by the System Board The State’s Attorney reasons that the
approval of the contract is approval of the expenditures that follow therefrom.
As a result of this, in the future, when the System’s website has the Purchasing information online, the
Bills and Claims will be posted online for informational purposes. In the meantime, they will be
periodically reported to the Board.
________________________________

Description:

Request for authorization extend and increase by $1,121,250.00 and extend for three (3)
months from 9/1/09 - 11/30/09 for the commercial nursing registry services for Stroger,
Provident, Oak Forest, Ambulatory & Community Health Network, Cermak Health Services,
and Juvenile Temporary Detention Center.

Justification :

The request to enter into a contract with the Nurse Registries was originally presented a t the Finance
Committee meeting of 6/12/09 and withdrawn and deferred. The request was re-submitted a t the Finance
Committee of 6/30/09 and approved to be presented to the CCHHS Board of Directors meeting of 7/16/09.
The approved transmittals were available to us on 7/21/09. The requisitions and copies of the approval
were submitted to Cook County Purchasing within two days, but at that time CCHHS Purchasing functions
were being centralized at Stroger Hospital. Cook County Purchasing was already boxing all of the Hospital
Systems work, finished and unfinished to send to us. We received templates to create the Nursing contracts on
8/17/09, but all language referencing Cook County Purchasing has to be reformatted to reflect the language
of the CCHHS.
This extension will allow time for the execution and implementation of the new contracts for this service.
