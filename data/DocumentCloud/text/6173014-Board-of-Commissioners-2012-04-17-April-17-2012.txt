recommended vendor to complete all three projects on a timely basis. Staff and the recommended

Commissioner Reidy then presented a Motion for adoption of Resolution for Item A1.
(Item A1)
In December 2011, the CHA advertised an Invitation for Bid (IFB), in area newspapers and
CHA’s website, for exterior facade improvements, mechanical and plumbing upgrades, unit
interior upgrades, and building life safety upgrades at Patrick Sullivan Apartments. The CHA
received and opened six bids, and after analyzing the bid submittal materials staff held a pre1

 award survey meeting with the apparent low bidder, Old Veteran Construction, Inc. The
representatives of that firm responded to questions on the thoroughness of their bid, how they
developed their Division Costs, and the amount of work they planned to self-perform. Having
performed a thorough review of the bid materials of the apparent low bidder, staff has
determined that Old Veteran is the lowest responsive and responsible bidder at $21,103,500.
Accordingly, the resolution for Item A1 approves award of contract to Old Veteran Construction,
Inc. for work at Patrick Sullivan Apartments. Patrick Sullivan Apartments is a 482-unit senior
housing building located at 1633 West Madison Street, Chicago, IL. The twenty-two story
structure was built in 1964 and sits on a 3.61-acre site that includes a management/maintenance
building at 35 South Paulina Street. The CHA commissioned a reserve study of its senior
housing portfolio in 2007 to more systemically project and manage the senior portfolio’s capital
needs over time. Accordingly, work for Sullivan Apartments includes, but is not limited to, the
following: replacing windows in all residential units; the proposed windows are commercial
grade ADA compliant aluminum windows; replacing sealant around all air conditioning units to
correct water infiltration; seal coating (waterproofing) existing masonry; replacing all existing
galvanized plumbing risers; upgrading the booster pumps to operate in emergencies; installation
of elevator recall systems; installation of a sprinkler system; upgrade the smoke detector and fire
alarm systems; replace any faulty equipment and repair all existing residential units to include
new kitchen, kitchen appliances, new vinyl flooring, new window blinds, and install new air
conditioning units. The CHA will seek to minimize the impact on residents once work begins.
The General Contractor will coordinate construction activities with the Private Property Manager
and Resident Services on a tier-by-tier basis to keep the residents aware of the status of work
being performed and anticipated move dates.

carried and said resolution adopted.

(Item A4)
The resolution for Item A4 approves award of contract to Pan-Oceanic Engineering Company in

drainage, eliminate water “ponding” issues after storm events, and improve pavement surfaces

4

 drainage issues. The rehabilitation left many of the fire lanes with ponding areas that will
accumulate water and sometimes freeze during winter conditions, resulting in some hazardous
conditions for residents and the neighborhood. Staff is assessing what, if any, additional capital
improvements are necessary at the development. Possible future improvements may include
more efficient approaches to trash removal and provision of building supplies, as well as
additional site security measures. In January 2012, CHA advertised an Invitation for Bid in area
newspapers and on the CHA website. The CHA received and opened six bids and held a preaward survey/clarification meeting with the apparent low bidder, Pan Oceanic Engineering Co.

There being no questions or discussion, Chairwoman Scott thereupon declared said Motion
carried and said resolution adopted.
Commissioner Adela Cepeda, Chairwoman of the Finance and Audit Committee, then presented
the report for the Finance and Audit Committee. Per Commissioner Cepeda, the Finance &
Audit Committee Meeting was held on Wednesday, April 11, 2012 at the CHA Corporate
Offices. Mike Gurgone, Treasurer, presented the Committee with the March 2012 Treasury and
Cash Flow Report.
Commissioner Cepeda then presented an Omnibus Motion for adoption of resolutions for Items
B1 and B2.
(Item B1)
The CHA currently handles its duplication services by several methods. Staff can create copies
utilizing one of the copy areas located within CHA administrative offices, by utilizing the
internal reproduction facility located on the 10th floor at 60 E. Van Buren, or by utilizing a third
party vendor. An assessment of the internal reproduction facility revealed the true cost to
operate the facility and indicated the potential for CHA to reduce its reproduction expenses.
The high volume printers currently in use at the CHA’ reproduction facilities are over 15 years
old and would soon need replacement. The CHA decided to explore the viability of utilizing a
third party vendor for its reproduction needs. Accordingly, in June 2011, the CHA issued a
5

 Request for Proposal (RFP) to solicit qualified firms to provide high volume print/duplication
and document preparation services for the CHA. The RFP was advertised in area newspapers
and the CHA website. The CHA solicited 75 vendors; 37 vendors picked up the solicitation, of
which nine were minority. Of the four proposals received, Aloha Document Services was
determined to offer an excellent proposal that met the requirements of the RFP and was found to
provide the best overall value. Aloha’s outstanding features includes exceptional location, one
of the lowest overall cost and the vendor’s all digital equipment eliminated the need to subcontract out any reproduction jobs or services. Aloha Document Services is located at 60 E. Van
Buren, Suite 1502, and is WBE certified business. The resolution for Item B1 approves award of
contract to Aloha Document Services for high volume print, duplication and document
preparation services.
RESOLUTION NO. 2012-CHA-27
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the
Board Letter dated April 11, 2012, entitled, “RECOMMENDATION TO ENTER

THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY

and document preparation services for the Chicago Housing Authority for an
