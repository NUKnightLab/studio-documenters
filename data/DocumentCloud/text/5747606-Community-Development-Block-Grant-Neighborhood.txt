WHAT IS SUSAN G. 

Susan G. Komen is the world's largest breast cancer organization.
funding more breast cancer research than any other nonpro?t
outside of the federal government while providing real-time help
to those facing the disease. Komen has set a Bold Goal to reduce
the current number of breast cancer deaths by 50 percent in the
U.S. by 2026. Since its founding in 1982. Komen has funded more
than $956 million in research and provided more than $2.1 billion
in funding to screening. education. treatment and 
support programs serving millions of people in more than 30
countries worldwide. Komen was founded by Nancy 6. Brinker.
who promised her sister. Susan G. Komen. that she would end the
disease that claimed Suzy's life. That promise has become
Komen's promise to all people facing breast cancer. Visit
HYPERLINK komen.org or call 1-877 GO
KOMEN. Connect with us on social at HYPERLINK 
komen.org/social" ww5.komen.org/social.

WHAT IS SUSAN G. 
GREATER -

We are proud to of?cially announce the formation of the Susan
G. Komen' Greater Detroit Affiliate.

The Komen Detroit Race for the Cure (RFTC) was established
in 1992 in partnership with the Michigan Cancer Foundation.
now the Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute. This
25-year partnership has been highly successful and has
raised more than $29 million to invest in the fight against
breast cancer. By working in collaboration with our
valued partners at Karmanos. the decision was made to
transition the current Race arrangement to a fully
functioning Af?liate of Susan G. Komen. The goal of
this evolution is to establish a strong. sustainable
Affiliate capable of reaching larger amounts of
women and men in the Metro Detroit area while
continuing to honor the traditions, culture and
accomplishments of our respected previous
partnership with Karmanos.

Preparation for this transition began two years
ago with the recruitment of a Founding Board

 

of Directors. The Founding Board. comprised of nine
enthusiastic and dedicated individuals, have been working
tirelessly to develop the operational framework of the Affiliate.
This work took place while our devoted RTFC staff and army of
volunteers continued to successfully manage and execute
Races in both 2016 and 2017. In 2018. with the establishment of
our new Affiliate. we will be able to open new revenue and
mission opportunities. While the Detroit Race for the Cure will
continue to be an important yearly event, we will be in a
position to better leverage national programs and raise funds
from local supporters outside of the race environment.

To help us navigate these exciting changes, the Board has
recruited and hired a new Executive Director, Aimee Nimeh.
Aimee comes to us from Common Ground where she held the
position of Vice President of Programs and Services. With a
Masters Degree in Social Work and over 13 years of experience
in the non-profit environment. Aimee's leadership will be vital
in responding to the changing non-profit landscape, to fully
capitalize on organizational efficiencies and national programs.
and to maximize our impact on the communities we serve.

Thank you for your continued support and commitment to our
organization. We are confident that if we continue to work
together we will reach Komen's Bold Goal of cutting breast
cancer mortality by 50% by 2026.

Sincerely.
Board of Directors
Susan G. Komen Greater Detroit Affiliate

Thank you so much to all the dedicated runners, walkers, volunteers and supporters
of Susan G. Komen Detroit Race for the Cure??. it is through the commitment of
individuals like you that we were able to grant more than $200,000 to local breast
cancer programs and nearly $155,000 to breast cancer research in 2018. Since 1992,
Komen Detroit Race for the Cure has raised and invested more than $29 million.
With every step, we get closer to a cure.
