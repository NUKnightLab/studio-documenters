Question/Comment

Response

I would like to have a moment of silence for the innocent victims
of street violence, who also fell victim to the gentrification and
destabilization of the Chicago Housing Authority process whose
lives are being lost due to the non-compliance of Section 3. I
was here last month and Mr. Charles, I see you have in the
notes that I indicated that I had two appointments with housing.
I asked you to inform her that I couldn’t be in two places at the
same time, this was priority due to you all not being able to
handle form. You indicated to me that there was nothing you
could do about that which insinuated to me that, questions about
whether you are here in the people’s best interest and whether
you’re here to invoke and possess any black power because
that’s what we need and you represent black people sitting in
that seat. I have over 500 CHA residents who have been
neglected, sir. My house is their house. We are dealing with an
unorthodox situation. I would like to know who the Section 3
Administrator is, I’ve met the Section 8 President and I would
like to know who the legal counsel is. We have extended an
invitation to you to come out to the community because nobody
knows who you are, making all these decisions. We would like
you to come out and do a meet and greet and make it a priority.

CHA’s Chief Legal Officer is Scott Ammarell and the Section 3
Administrator is Jessica Mallon.
