06:04:42

earlier, this meeting is part of a broader

6

06:04:45

timeline regarding the proposed action, and as a

7

06:04:47

part of this process, CPS began by publishing

8

06:04:50

draft guidelines for school action on

9

06:04:52

October 1st and then announcing proposed school

10

06:04:54

actions on December 1st.

11

06:04:57

of community engagement and input, and following

12

06:05:00

this announcement, CPS will host two community

13

06:05:04

meetings and one public hearing to gather

14

06:05:07

additional public feedback.

17

06:05:16

18

06:05:17

19

06:05:19

will review all input, and after this CEO

20

06:05:19

Jackson may make a recommendation to the Board

21

06:05:24

of Education to vote on the proposed action.

22

06:05:25

And following a potential recommendation, the

23

06:05:28

board will then vote on whether or not to

06:05:31

approve the proposed action at the February

15

06:12:40

Everyone was very supportive.

positions that are going to be lost over at

those teachers either have priority at Henry and

have this potential opportunity to expand our

7

06:14:40

grades here at Henry School.

8

06:14:43

I first got here at Henry School a ton of the

9

06:14:46

main things that parents consistently ask is

10

06:14:46

when we're going to add 7th grade, when we're

11

06:14:52

going to add 8th grade, and so it seems like

12

06:14:53

it's a very long journey, and we are not

13

06:14:56

completely there yet.

14

06:14:58

like it might happen, but, again, it really

15

06:15:00

depends on the support of the community.

16

06:15:02

17

06:15:04

06:15:26

have been put forward by both Haugan and Henry

06:15:30

opportunities for the children at these

4

06:15:31

programs, including expanding the 7th and 8th

5

06:15:34

grade.

6

06:15:34

7

06:15:36

note, and I'm going to echo Alderman Mell, we

8

06:15:40

have some exemplary teachers that started the

9

06:15:43

middle school program at Roosevelt.

10

06:15:45

extremely proud of the work they have done.

11

06:15:48

We're extremely proud of the work that the

12

06:15:49

children and the families have done.

13

06:15:51

want to see the continuing of support for those

14

06:15:54

families.

15

06:15:54

16

06:15:57

if your son or daughter is currently involved in

17

06:15:59

the 7th or 8th grade program, our priority right

18

06:16:02

now is absolutely the support of those families.

19

06:16:06

As they transition next year, the 8th graders

20

06:16:10

who are currently our 8th graders, are going to

21

06:16:12

high school, many of which will be staying on at

and in Chicago there has been a big effort to

stop public education and to turn the public

16

06:25:14

schools over to private profit-making

17

06:25:20

enterprises, and to empty out Roosevelt High

18

06:25:27

School under any excuse is a likely path that

19

06:25:33

follows a pattern of emptying out schools and

20

06:25:38

closing schools, public schools, neighborhood

21

06:25:43

schools, and then turning them over to private

22

06:25:54

corporations that do not have local school

07:01:17

for you, but I am speaking with all sincerity.

07:01:24

We would be very grateful to have the

07:01:27

opportunity to study 7th and 8th grade in a

7

07:01:30

great school with a great teacher and great

how much I hate speaking in front of a big group

16

of people, have decided to be my support.

17

07:02:07

was a former teacher at Marshall Middle School,

18

07:02:10

and I know the benefits of having a group of

19

07:02:13

students who are in a developmental age that are

20

07:02:17

more contributing members to their community in

21

07:02:21

a middle-school level, and we also would love to

22

07:02:25

consider our Girls on the Run middle school

23

07:02:28

program here at Patrick Henry as they start to

24

07:02:29

get older and learn a girls' curriculum that

academics and social needs.
Once again, we are like family.

Thank you for listening.
