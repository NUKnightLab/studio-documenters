the degree to which health care services for individuals and populations increase the likelihood
of desired health outcomes and are consistent with professional knowledge" (IOM, 2001, p. 44}.

The six dimensions of quality are:
- Safety: Avoiding injuries to patients from the care that is intended to help them.

Effectiveness: Providing services loased on scientific knowledge to all who could benefit and
refraining from services to those not likely to loenefit.

- Patient-centered: Providing care that is respectful of and responsive to individual patient
preferences, needs, and values and ensuring that patient values guide all clinical decisions.

- Timeliness: Reducing waits and sometimes harmful delays for looth those who receive and
those who give care.

- Efficiency: Avoiding waste of equipment, supplies, ideas, and energy.

- Equity: Providing care that does not vary in quality because of personal characteristics such
as gender, ethnicity, geographic location, and socioeconomic status.
