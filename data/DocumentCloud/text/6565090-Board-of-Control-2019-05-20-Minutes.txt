Department of Development,

Commission in the amount of $210,000.00 for operational support for the period 5/20/2019 – 5/19/2020.
b) Recommending a payment to Greater Cleveland Film Commission in the amount of $210,000.00 for
operational support for the period 5/20/2019 – 5/19/2020.
Funding Source: General Fund
Paul Herdeg, Department of Development and Ivan Schwarz, President & CEO, Greater Cleveland Film
Commission, presented. Trevor McAleer asked how the Cleveland Film Commission would be impacted

 if the Senate does not place the Ohio Motion Picture Tax Credit incentive back into the House Bill version;
and asked if the creation of 5,000 fulltime equivalent jobs is for the Cuyahoga County Cleveland area or
Statewide. Nan Baker asked for confirmation that the State budget needs to be approved by the end of
June; and asked if there is any urgency or can the County delay the vote and wait to receive the
confirmation from the Senate. Matt Carroll asked Mr. Schwarz to comment on trends and Northeast
Ohio’s competition across the Country for jobs as well as comment on similar jurisdictions that make this
kind of determination as it relates to film production in the State of Ohio.
Mr. Carroll asked for clarification that if there were to be a change as it relates to the Senate reducing the
Tax Credit incentive in the proposed budget, there are still projects in the pipeline that the Cleveland Film
Commission has to complete, as it relates to Ms. Baker’s question regarding the delayed response of the
Senate. Ms. Baker asked for clarification that given the worse-case scenario that the Film Commission is
still committed to receiving funding from the County either way.
Paul Herdeg stated that if this item is not approved we may be unable to assist with expenses that are
being incurred right now. Paul also stated that under the new system there is an impact on approval dates.
Mr. McAleer asked if the item could be held for 2 weeks and revise the dates as the County would still
offer general support in the full amount requested for the calendar year. Mr. Carroll said he feels the
County wants to support the organization even though the State legislation seems to be going in a certain
direction; and stated he is thinking of a contingency option but his personal opinion would be to move
forward with approval of this item but will defer to the Council’s view on the matter of delaying approval.
Further discussion ensued. Mr. Carroll asked Mr. Miller if he was comfortable with delaying the vote. Mr.
Miller stated that although he is ready to move forward with the item he is comfortable with delaying the
vote for 2 weeks as that might be a comprise in the middle, but he is not comfortable with waiting until
June 30th. Mr. Carroll stated that he was comfortable with open discussion and recommend a vote be
taken where Board members state their position. Matt Carroll made a motion to approve the item;
Michael Chambers seconded. Item BC2019-355 was approved by majority roll call vote with Nan Baker
and Trevor McAleer casting dissenting votes.
B. – New Items for Review

Preventative Maintenance Program - Crack Sealing and Striping.
Funding Source: $7.50 License Tax Fund
Michael Chambers, Department of Public Works, presented. Nan Baker asked for clarification on whether
the Preventative Maintenance Program is giving credit to those cities that have the Program or is it for
Cities that do not have one and the County is trying to create one, as it relates to the Ms. Baker’s advance
question of whether or not the Program is evenly distributed among districts; asked if there is a list
available of the municipalities that have applied for the Program and received funding; asked how the
County decides which communities receive funding once it has been determined that preventative
maintenance is needed; and asked if there are any restrictions when applying for the Program. Mr.
Chambers stated he will provide Board members with a list of the 42 municipalities that are currently
participating in the Program.

 Dale Miller asked for clarification on whether the communities reflected on the list that Board members
received are among the 42 municipalities participating in the program; and asked how does the County
determine which roads receive maintenance under this Program and maintenance performed under
Cooperative Agreements with municipalities. Matt Carroll motioned to approve the item; Dale Miller
seconded. Item BC2019-373 was unanimously approved.
BC2019-374

Program for the period 5/20/2019 – 12/31/2020.
Funding Source: Demolition Fund
Kenneth Surratt, Department of Development, presented. Dale Miller asked for clarification as to whether
there is still 8 million dollars that has not been appropriated yet out of the 50-million-dollar goal, as it
relates to the remaining balance after Round 9 is considered and approved by the Board; and inquired
about the current projection as to when the entire 50 million will be exhausted. Nan Baker asked for
clarification on why the funding is for Cleveland Heights only; and asked if the residential structures
chosen is a collaborative effort between the cities and the County. Matt Carroll asked if the 7.3 million
coming in is in addition to the 42 million. Matt Carroll motioned to approve the item; Dale Miller

Funding Source: General Fund
Paul Herdeg, Department of Development, presented. Trevor McAleer asked if the County has always
provided funding for Special Improvement District (SID) support and operational support services; and
asked for an itemized total of the expenses. Matt Carroll asked for confirmation that the $100,000.00 (SID)
expense is generally based on the County’s presence downtown. Dale Miller commented that the
Department of Development has a lot of irons in the fire and he believes there is a benefit for having this
partnership to perform some of this work, which would otherwise fall under Government responsibility.

approved.

Funding Source: General Fund
Charnese Wilson, Treasurer’s Office, presented. Dale Miller asked if this request is considered a sole
source since the recommended vendor is the only supplier. Lenora Lockett, Director of Procurement and
Diversity replied that for County standards this is not a sole this is a Government Purchase. Matt Carroll
commented that there is a provision in the Code that covers this purchase as stated in the response to
the advance question posed by Council. Ms. Lockett confirmed that the services are listed under the
Administrative List of Procurement Exemptions. Trevor McAleer asked for clarification on how the postage
for other bulk mail items of this nature are paid for as he thought that awards made to the United States
Postal Service are not considered by the Board of Control due to the approved Ordinance. Further
discussed ensued. Mr. Carroll stated that maybe we can review where these types of items should be

the past if any unforeseen circumstances emerge where the County is forced to bid out the services; and

Time Sensitive/Mission Critical
BC2019-388
Department of Public Works, recommending an award on RQ45690 to Advance Door Co. in the amount
not-to-exceed $17,215.56 for door and gate repairs at various County Buildings.
Funding Source: General Fund – Internal Service Fund
Thomas Pavich, Department of Public Works, presented. Matt Carroll motioned to amend the agenda to
consider the item; Michael Chambers seconded.
Dale Miller commented that most of the Mission Critical items being presented are for a single
unanticipated incident, a repair, for a child needing special treatment or for equipment that breaks down
in the Medical Examiner’s Office, but this appears to be a more general item that included the repair of
a number of items at the same time and asked why this is being submitted as a mission critical item; asked
if the price is essentially the same as what the County would have paid under the current contract; and
asked if the doors were inoperable. Nan Baker asked for confirmation that this is not a generic expense,
this is for (4 ) specific doors in need of repair that are being lumped together.
Trevor McAleer asked if the repairs were made before April why did so much time elapse before
submitting the to the Board of Control. Matt Carroll motioned to approve; Dale Miller seconded. Item
BC2019-388 was unanimously approved.
