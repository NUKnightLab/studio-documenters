 III. Action Items (continued)
C. Contracts and Procurement Items (Attachment #2)
Leticia Reyes-Nash, Director of Programmatic Services and Innovation, reviewed a presentation (Attachment #3)
regarding the Cook County Assisted Outpatient Treatment Program and related Substance Abuse and Mental Health
Services Administration (SAMSHA) grant; the request to accept the grant and execute grant-funded contracts relating
to that subject are included in the Contracts and Procurement Items as request numbers 1 through 6.
Chairman Estrada noted that, with regard to request numbers 2 through 6, in addition to listing under the methodology
that these are sub-grants, that section should reference that they are a co-applicant to the grant.
Charles Jones, Director of Strategic Sourcing and Supply Chain Management, provided an overview of the remaining
requests presented for the Committee’s consideration.
With regard to request number 15, Director Richardson-Lowry inquired regarding the vendor’s responsiveness to the
goals set under the County’s Ordinance on Minority and Women-Owned Business Enterprises (M/WBE). Mr. Jones
stated that the vendor has been found to be responsive to the County’s M/WBE Ordinance, but he was unsure of the
goals set or whether a partial waiver was granted. Director Richardson-Lowry requested that, if a significant reduction
of the goal was granted by Contract Compliance, then this should be communicated to the Committee through the
Chair. During the discussion of request number 16, Director Richardson-Lowry made the same request, that the
Committee be notified if a significant reduction of the M/WBE goal was granted.
With regard to request number 17, Director Junge inquired whether those janitorial staff are required to be unionized.
Mr. Jones responded that they are not, as long as the vendor pays those staff prevailing wages and a living wage. Dr.
John Jay Shannon, Chief Executive Officer, noted that the administration tried the model of having the same unified
staff performing that function across the System - on the hospitals’ campuses and in the regional outpatient centers and
clinics - but that model has not been working. Therefore, the administration is pulling back the employed staff, and
this contract is to go back to a de-centralized model for janitorial services for the Ambulatory clinics.
With regard to request number 23, Mr. Jones stated that the contract period should reflect a period of sixty (60)
months, not thirty-six (36) months.
Director Richardson-Lowry, seconded by Chairman Estrada, moved the approval of
request numbers 1 through 26, as amended, noting the correction to the contract period
for request number 23, and subject to completion of review by Contract Compliance,
where appropriate. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

D. Any items listed under Section III and VI

IV. Recommendations, Discussion / Information Items
A. Report from Supply Chain Management
• Report of procurement and non-procurement matters for
FY2016 – 3rd Quarter
• Report of emergency purchases
There were no emergency purchases presented for the Committee’s information. The FY2016 3rd Quarter Report
of Procurement Matters will be presented at next month’s meeting.
Page 2 of 62

 V.

Report from the Chief Financial Officer (Attachment #4)
• Report
• Metrics
• Financial Statements through August 2016
Mr. Akpan reviewed the report, which included metrics and Financial Statements through August 2016. The
Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
Director Richardson-Lowry noted that, with regard to the information on net days in accounts receivable, there was
such a large differential, and she knows that Mr. Akpan is looking at ways to close that gap, but if he could be
more detailed in his next presentation next month, that would be helpful. With respect to consulting services, she
noted that they are now at $22 million on the spend rate, which is a hefty spend rate for this organization - it might
be helpful to have a drill-down on the categories, as there might be some areas ripe for consolidation or in-housing.

VI.

Closed Meeting Items
A.

Proposed request to negotiate and execute an agreement for the acquisition of
property to be utilized by CCHHS for a CCHHS Regional Outpatient Center
Director Richardson-Lowry, seconded by Chairman Estrada, moved to recess the
open meeting and convene into a closed meeting, pursuant to the following
exceptions to the Illinois Open Meetings Act: 5 ILCS 120/2(c)(5), regarding “the
purchase or lease of real property for the use of the public body, including meetings
held for the purpose of discussing whether a particular parcel should be acquired,”
and 5 ILCS 120/2(c)(6), regarding “the setting of a price for sale or lease of property
owned by the public body.” THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY and the
Committee recessed into a closed meeting.
Chairman Estrada declared that the closed meeting was adjourned. The Committee
reconvened into the open meeting.
Director Richardson-Lowry, seconded by Chairman Estrada, moved to approve the
request to negotiate and execute an agreement for the acquisition of property to be
utilized by CCHHS for a CCHHS Regional Outpatient Center. THE MOTION
CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
