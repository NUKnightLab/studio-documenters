Senior Vice President of Resident Services Division presented a report on CHA’s Section 3
Program.
Commissioner Young then presented an Omnibus Motion for adoption of the Resolutions for
Items A1 thru A4.

(Items A1)
The CHA issued a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the provision of SUN Hardware and Software
Maintenance Services. The CHA utilizes SUN hardware and software to support
internal/external communications and the CHA’s essential operating functions. The RFP was
advertised in area newspapers and was also sent out to 239 vendors and 70 Assist Agencies.
Only one proposal was received in response to the RFP. The proposal was deemed responsive
and was given to the evaluation committee for their review. Following the written evaluation
scoring phase FASTech Inc. was determined to offer an excellent proposal that met the technical
requirements of the RFP, and was found to provide overall value consistent with CHA’s
2

 requirements for the SUN Hardware and Software Maintenance Services. Accordingly, the
resolution for Item A1 approves award of contract to FASTech for SUN Hardware and Software
maintenance services.
RESOLUTION NO. 2011-CHA-97
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated August 10,
2011, entitled “Authorization to enter into a Contract with FASTech Inc. for
SUN Hardware and Software Maintenance Services”.
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT

It is recommended that the Board of Commissioners authorize the Interim Chief
Executive Officer or his designee to enter into a three (3) year base term contract
with FASTech Inc. for CHA’s SUN Hardware and Software Maintenance
Services in an amount not-to exceed $359,312.70. It is also recommended that
the Board authorize the CEO, at his discretion, exercise Option Year 1 in an
amount not-to-exceed $119,770.90, subject to funding availability. The total
aggregate not-to-exceed contract amount will be $479,083.60 for the 3 year base
term and the 1 year option.

(Item A2)
The resolution for Item A2 approves a two year extension of the support and maintenance
agreement for the Yardi Housing Management Software. In 2005 the CHA implemented the
Yardi Housing Management System to replace its existing Public Housing Management System
and replaced the legacy system for the Housing Choice Voucher program. The CHA has
maintained and supported the base Yardi system through an optional and renewable annual
maintenance and support agreement with Yardi under the Software License and Support
Agreement (SLSA). CHA has elected to license additional Yardi software, including the
vendor’s Customer Service, Portfolio Management Dashboard and Web Portal Modules. These
new Upgrade Modules are separately licensed and are currently being implemented into CHA’s
production environment. Once fully implemented and accepted by the CHA, these Upgrade
Modules will be subject to the same terms and conditions for ongoing support, maintenance and
upgrade coverage as the parties have observed for Yardi Voyager System. With the licensing
and implementation of the additional Upgrade Modules, CHA’s maintenance fees will be
$223,845.00 for the next 12 months. The Yardi maintenance and support fees for the second year
are projected to total $232,798.00. Pursuant to the SLSA Agreement for the Yardi Systems and
software, the CHA must maintain support and maintenance services with Yardi to receive
updates and upgrades to the software, as well as to receive technical support. Yardi Voyager
maintenance, software upgrades and technical support is available exclusively from Yardi
Systems, Inc.
RESOLUTION NO. CHA-2011-98
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated August 11,
2011, “AUTHORIZATION FOR A TWO (2) YEAR EXTENSION OF THE
SUPPORT AND MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT FOR THE YARDI
HOUSING MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE”.
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT

The Board of Commissioners authorizes the Interim Chief Executive Officer or
his designee to enter into a two (2) year extension of the support and maintenance
agreement for the Yardi Housing Management Software, in an amount not to
exceed $456,643.00, pursuant to 24 CFR 85.36(d)(4)(A).

(Items A3)
The resolution for Item A3 approves a not-to-exceed commitment of $1,000,000 to the
Partnership for New Communities, or another nonprofit organization, for the Find Your Place
(FYP) in Chicago program to continue to stimulate sales of existing homeownership units. To
stimulate market rate sales of homeownership units in CHA’s new mixed-income communities
in the current housing market, CHA, the philanthropic community and developers have utilized
many creative strategies such as home buyer incentives, developer promotions, dramatic price
reductions, promotion of the recent first time home buyer federal tax credit and other incentives.
Upon board approval, CHA will continue to provide one-time cash assistance to home buyers in
3

 increments ranging from $10,000-$20,000, to encourage the sale of 50-100 market rate
homeownership units. The incentive packages will cover a variety of costs associated with
purchasing a home. The commitment also includes an amount of $30,000 allocated for
administrative expenses. CHA has been involved as a lead partner with the City of Chicago, the
MacArthur Foundation, and the Partnership for New Communities in the FYP program since its
inception in September 2008.
RESOLUTION NO. 2011-CHA-99
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the
Board Letter dated August 10, 2011 entitled, “RECOMMENDATION TO
CONTINUE TO FUND HOME BUYER INCENTIVES IN PLAN FOR
TRANSFORMATION COMMUNITIES THROUGH THE FIND YOUR PLACE
IN CHICAGO PROGRAM”;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners approves the commitment not-to-exceed $1,000,000
to the Partnership for New Communities, or another nonprofit organization, for
the Find Your Place in Chicago program to continue to stimulate sales of existing
homeownership units on in the new Plan for Transformation Communities.

(Items A4)
The CHA released a Request For Proposal (RFP) in March 2011 and received two responsive
proposals, including one from the proposed awardee, Constellation NewEnergy, Inc., an
independent wholesale electricity supplier. Market costs for electricity supply have fluctuated in
recent years, and most recently declined due to a decrease in the demand for electricity.
However, with the present economic turmoil, prices remain volatile and unpredictable.
Meanwhile, the CHA’s total electricity consumption has decreased over the past several years
due to the closing of many of the high-rise buildings across the portfolio. Based on CHA’s usage
profile of 44,503,883 kWh during a 12 month period, the projected total cost for the commodity
and delivery during the one year base term is $3,608,377. This new rate represents a 16%
decrease from the previous contracted rate. Constellation NewEnergy’s rates are blended
wholesale supply rates and continue to be competitive on the open market. Their blended rate
includes the costs for commodity charge, customer charge, customer transition charge and
transmission. Constellation NewEnergy’s proposal was determined to be the most advantageous
of the submitted offers and benefits the CHA in that it provides the most competitive and
transparent pricing for a portfolio of CHA properties that continues to undergo constant change.
Additionally, Constellation’s performance under the current supply agreement has been
favorably regarded. The resolution for Item A4 ratifies a one year service agreement with a oneyear option period with Constellation NewEnergy, Inc. for electricity supply and delivery
services at various CHA properties. This item was approved by the Finance Committee on June
15, 2011, but due to lack of quorum, this item was not voted on at the June 21, 2011 Board
Meeting. The existing contract was due to expire on June 30, 2011. In order to avoid a disruption
in service and to prevent further increase in the rate, the Contracting Officer executed the pricing
scheduling to lock in a firm fixed rate ($.056174) for a based term of twelve months.
RESOLUTION NO. 2011-CHA-100
WHEREAS, The Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the
Board Letter dated August 10, 2011, entitled “RECOMMENDATION TO
RATIFY A CONTRACT WITH CONSTELLATION NEWENERGY, INC. FOR
THE SUPPLY AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRICITY TO CONSTELLATION
NEWENERGY, INC.”;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners hereby ratifies a one year service agreement with a
one (1) one-year option period with Constellation NewEnergy, Inc. for electricity
supply and delivery services at various CHA properties in a not-to-exceed amount
of $2,499,996 for commodity and a not-to-exceed amount of $1,108,381 for
service and delivery, for a total amount not-to-exceed $3,608,377 for the one-year

There being no questions or discussion, the Chairman thereupon declared said Motion carried
and said resolutions adopted.
In the absence of Committee Chair Reidy, Commissioner Mildred Harris presented the report for
the Operations and Facilities Committee. Per Commissioner Harris, the Operations and
Facilities Committee held its regular meeting on Wednesday, February 9, 2011 at the CHA
Corporate Offices.
Commissioner Harris then presented an Omnibus Motion for adoption of the Resolutions for
Items B1 thru B4.
(Item B1)
The resolution for Item B1, approves acceptance of Tax Incremental Financing (TIF) for TIF
eligible site improvements at Judge Harry M. Fisher Apartments. The City of Chicago is
authorized under the provisions of the Tax Increment Allocation Redevelopment Act to finance
projects that eradicate blight conditions, and conservation factors that could lead to blight,
through the use of tax increment allocation financing for redevelopment projects. Using this
authority, the City adopted ordinances in November of 2007 to create a Tax TIF District for the
Hollywood/Sheridan Redevelopment Area. Since Judge Harry M. Fisher Apartments lies wholly
within the boundaries of the Hollywood/Sheridan Redevelopment Area. the City desires to use a
portion of the TIF Funds for partial reimbursement of the costs of the site improvements that are
TIF eligible. After reviewing a breakdown of the Project costs, CHA identified costs totaling
$296,946 that are TIF eligible. The original amount approved by the Board for this Project is
$1,791,098.00. Therefore, the CHA will potentially realize a reimbursement of 16.58% of this
amount under this IGA.
RESOLUTION NO. 2011-CHA-101
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated August 10,
2011, entitled “AUTHORIZATION TO ACCEPT TAX INCREMENTAL
FINANCING FUNDS FOR ELIGIBLE SITE IMPROVEMENTS AT JUDGE
HARRY
M.
FISHER
APARTMENTS,
ENTER
INTO
AN
INTERGOVERNMENTAL AGREEMENT WITH THE CITY OF CHICAGO
DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, AND

THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT

that the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Interim Chief Executive Officer
or his designee to accept Tax Incremental Financing (“TIF”) in an amount not to
exceed $296,946.00 for TIF eligible site improvements at Judge Harry M. Fisher
Apartments, a Senior Housing development, from the City of Chicago
Department of Housing and Economic Development (“HED”), enter into an
Intergovernmental Agreement (“IGA”) with HED, and increase the 2011 fiscal
budget therefor.

(Item B2)
The CHA advertised an Invitation for Bid for the general renovation of fourteen units at
Wentworth Annex. The work will include, but not be limited to, exterior stair replacement and
wall/soffit repairs, landscaping, fence replacement, remediation of asbestos and mold, finish
floor replacement, gypsum board replacement and painting, kitchen cabinetry and appliance
replacement, door and window replacement, and upgrades to the HVAC system. The IFB was
advertised in area newspapers and on the CHA website and on BuySpeed Online. Of the ten bids
received and opened pre-award survey meetings were held with the apparent low bidder and
second lowest bidder. The representatives of each firm responded to questions on the
thoroughness of their bids, how they developed their Division Costs, the amount of work they
planned to self-perform, and the supervisory coverage they would provide at the work site. A
Compliance Specialist reviewed the firms’ compliance materials in detail. Having considered the
responses of the two lowest bidders and performed a thorough review of the bid materials, staff
5

 determined that the lowest bidder was non-responsive to the IFB. Accordingly, the resolution for
Item B2 awards contract to Oakk Construction Co., Inc., the lowest responsive and responsible
bidder at $1,865,614.00.

RESOLUTION NO. 2011-CHA-102
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated August 10,
2011, entitled “AUTHORIZATION TO ENTER INTO A CONTRACT WITH
OAKK CONSTRUCTION CO., INC. FOR THE GENERAL RENOVATION OF

THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY

designee to enter into a contract with Oakk Construction Co., Inc. in the amount
of $1,865,614.00 for the general renovation of fourteen (14) units at Wentworth
Annex (IL2-032) – Phase 3. The work is to be performed in units located at 314
West 42nd Street, 331 West 42nd Street, 351 West 42nd Street, 357 West 42nd
Street, 347 West Root Street, 315 West Root Street, 310 West 42nd Place, 350

(Item B3)
CHA advertised a Request for Proposal (RFP) for title services on May 6, 2011 and May 11,
2011. The RFP was advertised in area newspapers and on the CHA website and on BuySpeed
Online. Thirty-eight firms were directly solicited, including one MBE firm. Seven firms
downloaded the solicitation from BuySpeed and one firm picked up a copy of the RFP at the
CHA. One proposal was received on June 8, 2011. The proposal was reviewed by an evaluation
committee and having reviewed the results of the Evaluation Committee, staff recommends that
the CHA execute a contract with Greater Illinois Title Company to perform title services for the
CHA. Accordingly, the resolution for Item B3 approves award of contract to Greater Illinois
Title Company who has extensive experience in providing these services to governmental
agencies. Greater Illinois Title Company has satisfactorily worked with the CHA in the past.
RESOLUTION NO. 2011-CHA-103
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated August 10,
2011, entitled “AUTHORIZATION TO ENTER INTO A CONTRACT WITH
GREATER ILLINOIS TITLE COMPANY TO PROVIDE TITLE SERVICES

THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners hereby authorizes the Interim Chief Executive
Officer or his designee to execute a contract with Greater Illinois Title Company
to perform Title Services for real estate transactions and property ownership
searches for CHA redevelopment/acquisition sites for an amount not-to-exceed
$800,000.00 for a base term of two (2) years. The contract shall provide for two
(2) one-year renewal options. This is an annual requirements contract with the
CHA. Needed services will be assigned on a Task Order basis.
This award is subject to the Contractor’s compliance with the CHA’s
MBE/WBE/DBE, Section 3 resident hiring, and bonding and insurance

(Item B4)
The CHA currently requires parking services for a total of 56 CHA pool and staff vehicles near
the main office located at 60 E. Van Buren. CHA solicited proposals for the parking services in
March 2011 from 77 vendors. Eleven firms picked up copies of the solicitation. CHA received
6

 one response, which was from Chicago Loop Parking, LLC. The proposal from Chicago Loop
Parking, LLC offers parking services with 24/7 access and in/out privileges at a monthly rate of
$175/vehicle at the Grant Park South Garage, and provides reserved parking spaces for
designated CHA pool and staff vehicles. This monthly parking rate represents a
$10/month/vehicle reduction from current rates, and is also made available to CHA employees
for unreserved parking spaces at employees’ own expense payable via payroll deduction. Other
services, amenities and benefits offered under this agreement include: security staff on premises,
underground parking, escort services to vehicles upon request, assistance with air for tires and
car battery jumpstarts. Accordingly, the resolution for Item B4 approves award of contract to
Chicago Loop Parking, LLC. The total number of spaces needed may ultimately decrease as pool
vehicles decrease, and the goal is to continue decreasing the total number of parking spaces.
RESOLUTION NO. 2011-CHA-104
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated August 10,
2011, entitled “AUTHORIZATION TO ENTER INTO A CONTRACT WITH

with Safe Haven’s Portfolio, 18th & Wabash Corporation; Nuestro Hogar and Viceroy
Apartments. Safe Haven’s Portfolio consists of two separate locations at 2049-2051 W. Jarvis

individuals that are disabled, homelessness, or victims of domestic violence. CHA will be the
primary source of referrals for these units and ASH’s site-based waiting list will provide a
secondary source of referrals. The PRA rent is $657/per month and is comparable with market
rent units in the Near South Side. Nuestro Hogar consists of 31 units located in two existing
multifamily buildings in the Humboldt Park community. The 18 unit building located at 3655
W. Wanbasia contains 3 RHI units; and the 13 unit building located at 4101 W. Kamerling

include historic preservation of the front façade and nearly a total gut of the interior to
accommodate the design public spaces on the first floor and 89 studio apartments. The PRA
application is for an AHAP and a 30-year HAP contract for 89 studio apartments. The proposed
PRA rent of $685/per month is supported by the market study for the neighborhood.
