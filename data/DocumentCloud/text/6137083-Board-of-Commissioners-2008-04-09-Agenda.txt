PRESENTATION
ITEM #6
WITHDRAWN
The following item was deferred at the March 6, 2008 Board Meeting:
Transmitting a Communication, dated February 25, 2008 from
MIKE QUIGLEY, County Commissioner
this request formally invites the Assessor’s Office to give a presentation highlighting the newest website
features available on the Assessor’s website. We appreciate all of the efforts the Assessor’s office has
made to comply with the amended Cook County Ethics Ordinance. The amendments to the Ethics
Ordinance sought to bring a greater level of transparency to the property tax appeal process, and the
changes made to the Assessor’s website have facilitated this goal of increased transparency. The recent
advancements to the Assessor’s website, making all property tax appeals data available and easily
accessible to the public, demonstrate the office’s willingness to go above and beyond our expectations of
transparency and equality in the tax appeal process.
In an effort to share the Assessor’s latest achievement with all Cook County Board members, county
employees, the press, and anyone who might utilize this new feature, we hope they will be available to
present the new website features at a Cook County Board meeting.

PROPOSED ORDINANCE
ITEM #7
WITHDRAWN
Submitting a Proposed Ordinance sponsored by
ANTHONY J. PERAICA, County Commissioner
PROPOSED ORDINANCE
An Ordinance providing for voter input with regards to any future Cook
County tax increases which exceed the rate of inflation or consumer price
index (CPI) adjustments.
WHEREAS, the County of Cook is a Home Rule unit and may, under the power granted by Section 6(a)
of Article VII of the 1970 Constitution of the State of Illinois, exercise any power and perform any
function pertaining to its government and affairs, including, but not limited to, the power to tax and to
incur debt; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board has recently voted to impose a $500 million tax increase upon the
residents of Cook County; and
WHEREAS, the amount of this tax increase is equal to roughly twice the amount of the actual county
deficit; and
WHEREAS, this tax increase will result in Cook County having a sales tax of more than 10%, which will
result in many residents fleeing to other counties to make purchases; and
WHEREAS, the decision of whether to increase taxes by such a dramatic amount should be made by the
voters of Cook County.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the President and Board of Commissioners of the
County of Cook, Illinois, as follows:

both, those for refunds made in the current or next fiscal year or those from gifts, federal funds,

revenue change as an offset. Initial bases are current fiscal year spending and property tax collected in
that year. Qualification or disqualification as an enterprise shall change bases and future year limits.
Future creation of bonded debt shall increase, and retiring or refinancing county bonded debt shall lower,
fiscal year spending and property tax revenue by the annual debt service so funded. Debt service changes,

officer shall maintain and accurately summarize all other relevant written
comments.

RESOLUTION OF THE COOK COUNTY BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS IN SUPPORT OF
THE APPLICATION FOR PURCHASE OF THE ELGIN, JOLIET AND EASTERN RAILWAY
BY THE CANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAY PENDING BEFORE THE UNITED STATES
DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION TO ENHANCE REGIONAL TRAIN SYSTEMS
WHEREAS, one third of the nation’s freight rail traffic moves to, from or through the Chicago area
every year making it the transportation hub of North America; and
WHEREAS, rail congestion has significantly slowed freight traffic through the Chicago region to the
point where it can now take a freight train 24 hours to travel the thirty miles through the City of Chicago,
slowing rail transportation nationwide; and
WHEREAS, opening up capacity on urban rail lines means that all rail traffic will move more efficiently
and smoothly through the city; and
WHEREAS, freight trains are three times more fuel-efficient and emit one-third less pollution than
trucks carrying comparable loads, thereby lessening the drain on the nation’s energy reserves; and
WHEREAS, a typical freight train carries the equivalent of 280 truck-trailer loads, thereby alleviating
highway congestion by keeping time-sensitive freight on the rails rather than diverting to highways; and

WHEREAS, rail transportation is crucial to the region economically touching five million jobs
nationwide; and
WHEREAS, if the problem of rail congestion in the region goes unchecked, it could cost the region $2
billion in production with impacts on 17,000 jobs over the next two decades; and
WHEREAS, the Chicago Region Environmental and Transportation Efficiency Program (CREATE) a
model public-private partnership, initiated more than five years ago, developed a comprehensive long
term plan that would revitalize the area’s transportation network by reconfiguring rail traffic through the
Chicago Metropolitan region; and
WHEREAS, the CREATE comprehensive plan still hasn’t received full government funding, even
though it has had wide support from every level of government, the private sector and a broad crosssection of non-governmental groups and organizations; and
WHEREAS, the Canadian National Railway Company, a founder and strong proponent of CREATE
since its inception, has proposed rerouting its traffic from the congested urban rail lines to the underutilized Elgin, Joliet and Eastern Railway at its own cost and expense, thereby opening up new capacity
on those urban lines; and
WHEREAS, by rerouting its traffic, the Canadian National Railway Company will relieve freight
congestion on many of Chicago’s regional rail lines, thereby reducing travel times, pollution from idling
trains and costs resulting from shipping delays.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and Cook County Board of
Commissioners urges the Surface Transportation Board of the U.S. Department of Transportation to
approve the application of the Canadian National Railway Company to acquire the Elgin, Joliet and
Eastern Railway as a valuable enhancement of the region’s rail network; and

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
RESOLUTION CONCERNING REMOVAL OF THE PUBLIC DEFENDER
WHEREAS, the office of the public defender is an office created by state statute, all as set forth in
Article 3, Division 3-4 of the Counties Code, 55 ILCS 5/1-1001, et seq. (“Illinois Law”); and
WHEREAS, Illinois Law sets forth the purpose of the public defender and the declaration of the General
Assembly of the State of Illinois wherein the General Assembly recognizes the People of the State of
Illinois’ fundamental right to quality legal representation in criminal and related proceedings; and
WHEREAS, Illinois Law also provides the process for appointment, the terms of employment, the oath
of office, the duties, the compensation, a provision for appointment of assistants, provisions for office
quarters and expenses and record keeping of the Public Defender in Cook County; and
WHEREAS, the President of the Cook County Board of Commissioners (the “President”) and the Cook
County Board of Commissioners clearly recognized the intent of the General Assembly to provide quality
legal representation to the indigent by seeking to reduce Edwin A. Burnette’s (hereinafter referred to as
the “Public Defender”) caseload by creating twenty-eight (28) new positions in the 2008 Budget; and
WHEREAS, notwithstanding the President’s and the Cook County Board of Commissioner’s willingness
to create twenty-eight (28) new positions to further ensure quality legal representation of the indigent,
during the Public Defender’s tenure, there were thirty-four (34) inmates of Cook County Jail (persons
held in custody who have not been convicted of a crime) who waited for trial for over five (5) years at an
approximate cost to the Cook County taxpayers of $5,584,500 ($90 per day for 34 inmates for 5 years),
while the Public Defender continues to fail to ensure that all assistant public defenders work a full forty
(40) hour work week, (See, Evaluation of the Juvenile Justice Division of the law office of the Cook
County Public Defender submitted herewith as Exhibit A on page 10 and hereinafter referred to as the
“Northwestern Report”); and
WHEREAS, Illinois Law provides the process for removing the Cook County Public Defender and is set
forth below:
The public defender once approved by the Board shall serve for 6 years and may be
removed by the President only for good cause or dereliction of duty after notice and a
hearing before the Board.

WHEREAS, Black’s Law Dictionary defines dereliction in the performance of duties as:
[W]illful or negligent failure to perform assigned duties; culpable inefficiency in performing
assigned duties.
West Group, Black’s Law Dictionary 454 (7th ed. 2001);
WHEREAS, the President, being the duly elected officer, has determined that there is good cause to
remove the Public Defender; and
WHEREAS, the Public Defender has willfully or negligently failed to perform the following assigned
duties as the Cook County Public Defender in that:
1.

The Public Defender failed to notify the administration of the Chicago Community
Group’s ongoing report concerning the Criminal Courts; and the Public Defender, as
cited in the Northwestern Report, failed to ensure that all employees of his office
performed a full forty (40) hour week of work in exchange for their compensation;
specifically, the Northwestern Report stated there existed a problem in his office
concerning the early departure of assistants after court (See, Exhibit A, page 10);

2.

The Public Defender has failed to timely process promotions of employees within his
office resulting in an unnecessary and unreasonable delay in the hiring of entry-level
employees. The following are examples of such failures:
•

On or about October 25, 2007, the Public Defender was provided with lists of
applicants for the promotional position of public defender III and IV. The Public
Defender has approximately fifteen (15) of these positions vacant. Filling these
positions would allow the Public Defender to create vacancies for public defender I
positions, and hire attorneys to reduce caseloads. As of March 31, 2008, the Public
Defender has failed to fill all such positions except three (3).

•

In or about July, 2007, the Public Defender requested that five (5) public defender I
positions be reclassified to clerical positions within his office, further reducing his
ability to hire attorneys to reduce caseloads. This request was processed on or about
July 17, 2007.

•

Beginning on or about November 29, 2007, the Public Defender was advised that
supervisory positions could not be posted until job descriptions for those positions
were completed by his office and reviewed by the Bureau of Human Resources.
Despite repeated communications, these descriptions were not completed until midMarch, 2008. At about that same time, the Public Defender requested that these
positions not be posted, thereby placing the entire process in indefinite limbo.

Such failures have led this Public Defender to have a caseload greater than the national
standard. (See, Exhibit B submitted herewith the American Council of Chief Defenders
Statement on Caseloads and Workloads, August 24, 2007); and
3.

The Public Defender failed to ensure that all non-union employees complied with the
President’s executive order concerning the five (5) furlough day mandate, which
contributed to additional financial burden to Cook County and such savings should have
been reprogrammed back into services to the poor; and

4.

The Public Defender did not adequately handle the disciplinary issue of an employee
under his supervision who is alleged to have committed a crime in the workplace and
alleged to have been in possession of illegal and illicit drugs in the workplace; (See,
Exhibit C submitted herewith Pot Delivered to Public Defender’s Office Gets Clerk,
November 28, 2007); and

5.

The Public Defender has failed to identify Shakman Exempt positions as required under
the provisions of the Supplemental Relief Order and Consent Decree established in the 69
C 2145 and titled Shakman, et al v. The Democratic Organization, et al.; and

6.

The Public Defender misled the Cook County Board of Commissioners by seeking the
appointment of a Special State’s Attorney to provide “analysis, interpretation and advice”
(See, Exhibit D submitted herewith Petition for Appointment of a Special State’s
Attorney) and the Public Defender exceeded such authority granted to him by this Board
of Commissioners by suing the President thereby causing a potential financial liability to

JARESE A. WILSON, Director, Department of Budget and Management Services
Subject: 1st Quarter Performance Report
submitting herewith a copy of the 1st Quarter Performance Reporting that highlights performance data
associated with Cook County Departments Services, Activities and Programs. This report is a starting
point when used in budgeting, long-term planning and goal setting, meaningful performance measures
will assist County Officials and Citizens in identifying future decisions regarding resources allocation and
service delivery. The 1st Quarter report will continue to be developed for subsequent quarters of FY 2008
to provide the means to share data on a range of programs, benchmark the County’s performance to
comparable jurisdictions, and improve service delivery through the application of best management
practices and efficient use of resources.
In the 1st Quarter Performance Report, we would like to highlight a Cook County Department that has
shown an especially useful performance measure and recognize their efforts. The Adult Probation
Department performance measure of “percentage of active standard probation cases being supervised
under Evidence Based Practices (EBP) - related procedures” should be acknowledged. The Adult
Probation Department is well above their target that indicates that community corrections programs that
are implemented have a direct impact and may lower offender risk and reduces recidivism.

Transmitting a Communication, dated March 26, 2008 from
MARK KILGALLON, Chief Administrative Officer, Bureau of Administration
requesting authorization to enter into a professional services contract with Integrys Energy Services,
Chicago, Illinois, for the purchase and delivery of natural gas for the County’s heating and cooling needs.
On February 6, 2008, the Board approved entering into a contract with Enbridge Gas Services (U.S.) Inc.,
however, negotiations conducted by the State’s Attorney’s Office with Enbridge were unsuccessful and
did not result in an agreement on contract terms.
Further requesting that Item #54 from the February 6, 2008 Board Agenda authorizing the Purchasing
Agent to enter into an agreement with Enbridge Gas Services (U.S.), Inc., Appleton, Wisconsin, be
rescinded.
To participate in the deregulated natural gas market, Integrys Energy Services will act as the exclusive
agent for all matters related to the procurement and delivery of natural gas and execute all documents as
may be necessary to carry out and comply with the provisions of the Illinois Commerce Commission’s
conditions of service for public utilities serving Cook County for customer owned gas.
On July 31, 2007, the Board of Commissioners authorized the Bureau of Administration to solicit
proposals through a Request for Proposals (RFP) process for the procurement and delivery of natural gas.
Request for Proposals were issued resulting in the submission of six responses. Evaluation of the
proposals was based upon the (1) margin cost per therm above the index cost of natural gas, (2) firm’s
experience, (3) firm’s financial stability and credit rating, and (4) firm’s ability to meet the MBE/WBE
requirements of the County.
Integrys Energy Services is the County’s current natural gas supplier with a proven track record and was
the second lowest cost proposal. Integrys proposes a margin cost of $0.0020 per therm of natural gas
above the index cost. Margin cost accounts for less than 0.3% of the County’s total gas costs. The
County currently uses an average of 13.7 million therms per year resulting in an estimated annual cost of

Chase Bank N.A., Chicago, Illinois, to provide lockbox, cash letter deposit and branch bank services for

Reason:

Since the contract was awarded on September 21, 2004 more than 3 million taxpayers have
paid property tax bills at more than 300 Chase Bank branches. Extending this contract with
no increase in costs provides a consistent payment option to the taxpayers of Cook County. A
potential conversion would not only consume significant time and resources that could be
utilized elsewhere within the Treasurer’s Office but also possibly confuse the taxpaying
public.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $400,000.00 per year, funded through compensating balances. Contract period:
February 1, 2009 through January 31, 2013.
