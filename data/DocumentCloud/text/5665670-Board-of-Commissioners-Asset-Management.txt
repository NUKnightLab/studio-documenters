Summary: This amendment provides for the second and final of two (2), one (1) year renewal options
and increases to the Countywide Job Order Contract (JOC) Program.
JOC is a quantity based
procurement process that allows facility owners to complete a multitude of repair/maintenance and
construction project with a single, competitively bid contract. The JOC process involved first selecting a
vendor pool of potential contractors through a competitive procurement process in accordance with the
Cook County Procurement Code, and identifying projects for such selected vendors. The vendors listed

The County is under no obligation to expend the amount requested, and is only obligated to pay JOC
contractors when the construction work is procured through the JOC Program. The amendment will allow
