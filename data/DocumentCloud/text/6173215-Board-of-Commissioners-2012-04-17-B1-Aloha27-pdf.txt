BACKGROUND INFORMATION
The CHA currently handles its duplication services by several methods. Staff can create copies
utilizing one of the copy areas located within CHA administrative of?ces, by utilizing the
internal reproduction facility located on the 10th ?oor at 60 E. Van Buren, or by utilizing a third
party vendor. An assessment of the internal reproduction facility revealed the true cost to
operate the facility and indicated the potential for CHA to reduce its reproduction expenses.

During 2011, internal reproduction facility produced over 3.7M copies, costing the
authority over $218,000 dollars. The average costs for a single black and white and color copy
were 4 cents and 10 cents, respectively. The high volume printers currently in use at the 
reproduction facilities are over 15 years old and would soon need to replacement. The CHA
decided to explore the viability of utilizing a third party vendor for its reproduction needs.

PROCUREMENT INFORMATION

In June 2011, the CHA issued Request for Proposal No. 11-00706 to solicit quali?ed
?rms to provide high volume print/duplication and document preparation services for the entire
Authority. The CHA advertised the RFP in the Chicago Sun Times, E1 DIA, and the Chicago
Defender. A solicitation notice was placed on Buy Speed and the CHA website. The CHA
solicited seventy-?ve (75) vendors, of which seventeen (17) were minority. In total, thirty-seven
(37) vendors picked up the solicitation, of which nine (9) were minority. The proposal due date
was Monday, June 27, 2011; the CHA received four (4) written proposals. The Respondents to
the RFP were: Aloha Document Services, Imaging Printing Corporation, Godni Group dfba?a
The UPS Store 5608 (UPS Store), and .

Aloha Document Services (?Aloha?) was determined to offer an excellent proposal that met the
requirements of the RFP and was found to provide the best overall value. If the 
reproduction volume remains consistent with 2011 printing levels, the CHA would save over
$28,000 annually based upon the recommended vendor?s proposed pricing.

Aloha?s outstanding features includes exceptional location, one of the lowest overall cost and the
vendor?s all digital equipment eliminated the need to sub-contract out any reproduction jobs or
services. Aloha Document Services is located at 60 E. Van Buren, Suite 1502, and is WBE
certified business. The principals have over 30 combined years of experience in the industry.


Based on the foregoing, it is in the best interest of the CHA to enter into contract with Aloha
Document Services for an amount not-to-exceed $490,000.00 for a two (2) year base period,
with two (2) one (1) year options to extend subject to Board of Commissioner?s approval.
