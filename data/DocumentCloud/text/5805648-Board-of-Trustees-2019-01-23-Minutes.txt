Re: Schrese Palm v. Cornelius Palm
Wayne County Circuit Court Case No. 13-102603-DO
Resolution Moved By: Trustee Sheehan - Supported By: Trustee Anthony
WHEREAS, the Board of Trustees is in receipt of an Amended Eligible Domestic
Relations Order (“EDRO”), dated December 28, 2018, wherein Schrese Palm, the
Alternate Payee, is awarded certain rights to the retirement allowance of Cornelius
Palm, the Participant, and
WHEREAS, the Retirement System consists of both a defined benefit plan and a
defined contribution (a/k/a the Annuity Savings Fund) plan, and
WHEREAS, pursuant to the EDRO, the Alternate Payee is entitled to 100% of the
marital portion of the Participant’s defined benefit plan benefits payable from the
Retirement System, and
WHEREAS, the payments from the plan to the Alternate Payee shall begin as soon as
administratively feasible as the Alternate Payee has already elected to commence her
share of the Participant’s benefits under a previously entered Order and elected a single
life annuity payable over her own life as her form of benefit, and accordingly Section 7
of the Amended EDRO is inapplicable, and
WHEREAS, the Board’s policy is to require that the cost for the actuary’s calculations
are to be borne by the parties to the domestic relations proceedings and the parties’
EDRO provides that the parties are to share responsibility for any and all additional
costs for actuarial services, and that the Alternate Payee’s share of such costs shall be
in proportion to her share of the Participant’s retirement benefit awarded to her under
the EDRO (i.e. 100% of the additional costs), and
WHEREAS, said matter had been discussed with legal counsel who has opined that the
applicable terms of said court order are consistent with the provisions of the Retirement
System and applicable law including Public Act 46 of 1991 (MCLA 38.1701) as
amended, therefore be it
RESOLVED, that the Board acknowledges receipt of said court order, will pay pension
benefits consistent with said order as soon as administratively feasible, and further
