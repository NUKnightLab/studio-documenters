 Chairman Hooker then informed the public that late last month CHA and BPI announced a
proposed settlement in the landmark Gautreaux Housing Discrimination case. The proposed
settlement would establish a framework to end more than 50 years of litigation and court
supervision of public housing in Chicago.
Eugene Jones, Chief Executive Officer, and James Bebley, Chief Legal Officer, then provided
Commissioners and the public with details of the proposed Settlement and steps CHA will take
to complete its Gautreaux obligations.
(Item No. 1)
On August 9, 1966, Plaintiffs Dorothy Gautreaux (now deceased) and other African-American
tenants who lived in public housing projects, along with applicants for public housing filed a
complaint against CHA alleging race discrimination. The Gautreaux Plaintiffs alleged that
CHA’s policies with respect to the selection of sites for public housing and for the assignment of
tenants were racially discriminatory and violated their constitutional rights. The court certified
the class of Gautreaux Plaintiffs and granted summary judgment against CHA, finding that CHA
selected housing project sites in predominantly black neighborhoods and used racial quotas to
limit the number of blacks in housing projects in predominantly white neighborhoods. To
prohibit the future use of discriminatory site selections and tenant assignments, racial quotas and
to remedy the past effects of same, in 1969, the court entered an order that did three things: 1)
divided the city into limited and general areas and required CHA to build/acquire units in limited
and general areas on a one to one ratio; 2) prohibited assignment of tenants on a racial basis and
required CHA to file a Tenant Assignment Plan with the court that was race neutral; and 3)
prohibited CHA from building developments that concentrated public housing families and
prohibited housing units higher than three floors. The Proposed Settlement: The parties
recognize that the conditions which led to the 1969 court order no longer exist. Over the years
the parties have jointly sought and obtained numerous orders that have waived and/or amended
various aspects of the 1969 court order. Rather than continue to seek court approval on a piece
meal basis, the parties have tentatively agreed to replace the 1969 court order with a settlement
agreement that would address four primary strategy areas as well as, set a framework for a
foreseeable end to this litigation. The first area involves CHA’s Plan for Transformation in
mixed-income developments currently underway or planned. The second area covers traditional
public housing, project-based vouchers and scattered-site units, in limited, general and
opportunity areas. The third area involves establishing goals for the Housing Choice Voucher
Program. The fourth and final area requires CHA to identify plans to replicate the Altgeld early
learning centers at four other CHA traditional developments. The settlement terms would
include specific goals and benchmarks for CHA developments currently in process or a
framework for future developments not currently on the “drawing board.” Finally, the settlement
agreement would have a finite, foreseeable end date, after which all plaintiffs and court oversight
would end. The parties acknowledge that the terms must be designed to provide CHA with
flexibility to adjust and be responsive to changes in circumstances. Accordingly, the resolution
for Item No. 1 approves authority to replace the current judgment order with a settlement
agreement. The settlement agreement would set forth specific benchmarks for CHA to meet and
an end date by which all claims against CHA would be dismissed with prejudice.
Chairman Hooker then invited residents and the public at large to address the Board.
Following Public Participation, Chairman Hooker presented a Motion for the approval of Item
No. 1 – Settlement Agreement in the matter of Dorothy Gautreaux et al vs. CHA.
RESOLUTION NO. 2019-CHA –1
