News from your Retirement Board & Happy Holidays
Over the past few months, there have been significant changes in the composition of the Retirement
Board of the Firemen’s Annuity & Benefit Fund of Chicago. On October 24, 2017, Daniel Fortuna was
re-elected as the annuitant Trustee by the retired members and I was elected by the active members to
serve as a Trustee. On December 15, 2017, a special election was held and Battalion Chief Thomas Cody
was elected by the active members of the Fund to serve on the Board. First Deputy Fire Commissioner
Richard Ford was appointed to the Board on September 15, 2017. At our December Board meeting, the
Trustees elected Dan Fortuna as Fund President, Rich Ford was elected as Fund Vice President and, I was
elected as Fund Secretary. We all look forward to the challenge of serving the active and retired members
of the Chicago Fire Department in our roles as Trustees on the Retirement Board.
Some of you may know the Fund’s former Chief Investment Officer Mike Moran from firehouse visits
over the years with several Trustees. Mike has helped with guiding the Fund’s investment strategy for
over twenty years. His strategy has helped the Fund navigate very difficult investment environments and
secure some of the best investment returns in the public fund universe over that time. Mike retired from
the Fund on June 30, 2017. Given that the Board has not yet selected a CIO, Mike has been asked by the
Board to serve as an advisor with the Fund in order to help the Fund through this transition period. With
his help, we hope to further benefit from his principled and disciplined investment approach and to obtain
the services of a new CIO to help navigate the difficult decisions required of the Board in an everchanging investment landscape.
With direction from the President and the entire Retirement Board our priorities over the next few months
include completing the Fund’s Popular Report, updating our “Summary of Benefits” and improving the
FABF website.
HB688 – Transfer of Downstate Fire Service (Article 4) Credit to FABF (Article 6)
Congratulations to Local 2 in their efforts to assist members seeking to transfer pensionable service credit
from a Downstate Fire Pension Plan to the Firemen’s Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago. Affected
members must be cognizant of the 6-month window to make application. The effective date of this
legislation is November 8, 2017. Therefore, members must make application by May 8, 2018 in order to
be eligible. As long as the application is made in a timely manner, members will have 5 years from the
date of application to pay the Fund the required payment. Additional information can be found on the
Fund’s website at FABF.org.

 EMWQ Fund
I would like to extend the “Board’s” gratitude to the men and women of the CFD as well as all of
our supporters for their generosity in supporting our neediest members. Thanks to all of you, we
were able to distribute $638,750.00 to our neediest widows and children this holiday season.
