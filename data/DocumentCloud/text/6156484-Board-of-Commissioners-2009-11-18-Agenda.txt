Sec. 74-70.

Class 8a and 8b Designation / Assessment Class

(a)
Class 8a. Real estate that is used primarily for industrial or commercial purposes, which
real estate would qualify for a Class 8 designation pursuant to Sections 74-62 through 74-64, except for
the fact that the qualifying use of the property prior to application for the incentive does not comply with
the definition of abandoned property provided for in Section 74-62(b), can receive a designation as a
Class 8a property so long as the applicant can show that it has complied with all of the requirements
necessary to receive a Class 8 designation per Sections 74-62 through 74-64, except for meeting the
definition of abandonment provided for in Section 74-62(b), but only when the Cook County Board of
Commissioners provides a resolution or ordinance in support of such designation absent abandonment.
(1)

The Cook County Board of Commissioners may only provide such a resolution or
ordinance in support of Class 8a designation absent abandonment when:
a.

An applicant who collects or transmits sales tax has obtained from the
municipality in which the real estate is located or the Cook County Board of
Commissioners, if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, an
agreement to abate a portion of the local government's sales tax generated by the
industrial or commercial enterprise located on such real estate and such
abatement of sales tax must cover the period of time for which the applicant
would qualify for this Class 8a incentive; and

b.

Applicant can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Cook County Board of
Commissioners that due to national and regional economic conditions beyond its
control the industrial or commercial enterprise has undergone a significant
reduction in net operating income of at least 40 percent in the year it makes
application for this incentive as compared to the average net operating income of
the industrial or commercial enterprise in the prior three years; and

c.

Applicant provides objective and credible evidence including, but not limited to,
an economic impact study that demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Cook
County Board of Commissioners that the ongoing industrial or commercial
enterprise is not economically viable and as such it will cease operations within
60 days of the submission of an eligibility application for Class 8a designation to
the Cook County Assessor, and thereafter the property will become vacant and
unused for an extended period of time of at least 24 months; and

(4)

Such a resolution or ordinance must contain:
a.

A finding that the Cook County Board of Commissioners has determined that
industrial or commercial enterprise has undergone a significant reduction in net
operating income of at least 40 percent in the year it makes application for the
incentive as compared to the average net operating income of the industrial or
commercial enterprise in the prior three years; and

b.

A finding that the Cook County Board of Commissioners has determined that
Class 8a designation of the property is necessary for the ongoing industrial or
commercial enterprise to continue its operations and that without such
designation the industrial or commercial enterprise would not be economically
viable causing the property to become vacant and unused; and

c.

A statement by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that it supports and
consents to the designation of the property as a Class 8a property absent an
abandonment requirement; and

d.

A statement by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that it supports and
consents to the application made to the Cook County Assessor requesting
designation as a Class 8a property absent an abandonment requirement.

When the real estate is located in an incorporated area of the county, and designation as a
class 8a property is sought using the provisions of this section, the municipality in which
the real estate is located must provide to the Cook County Assessor a resolution or
ordinance that contains the following:

continue its operations and that without such designation the industrial or
commercial enterprise would not be economically viable causing the property to
become vacant and unused; and

b.

A statement by the municipality that it supports and consents to the action by the
Cook County Board of Commissioners to support designation of the property as a
Class 8a property; and

Class 8a designation shall not be renewed:
a.

(5)

Applicant provides objective and credible evidence including, but not limited to,
an economic impact study that demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Cook
County Board of Commissioners that designation as a class 8a property will
allow the industrial or commercial enterprise to be economically viable and
thereby continue its operations so that the industrial or commercial enterprise can
continue to occupy and fully utilize the real estate for an extended period of time.

After the initial application has been approved and granted, if the subject real
estate receiving the Class 8a designation pursuant to the provisions of this section
is sold or the applicant transfers ownership of any portion of the property at any
time prior to the five-year term of the 8a classification, then the property's Class
8a classification shall be subject to an eligibility review by the Cook County
Board of Commissioners, the municipality, and the Assessor under the
procedures set forth in this Ordinance for the remainder of the five-year term.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, Cook County is a home rule unit of local government pursuant to Article VII Section 6(a)
of the 1970 Illinois Constitution, and as such may exercise any power and perform any function
pertaining to its government and affairs; and
WHEREAS, the current income tax system in Illinois is not fair to those who make $20,000 a year or
less and who pay a greater percentage of their income to taxes than those who make over $20,000 and
those who make $50,000 pay a greater portion of their income than those who make $75,000 a year and
as the income increases the percentage of income paid to taxes decreases in Illinois; and
WHEREAS, if the Illinois General Assembly is going to increase income taxes it affords an opportunity
to correct the equity problem among different income brackets; and
WHEREAS, the State of Illinois has abdicated its constitutional and legislative responsibilities to fund
education at 51 percent of the cost; and
WHEREAS, the over reliance on property taxes to fund education poses undue hardship on property
owners and especially those seniors who have to rely on a fixed income; and
WHEREAS, income tax coupled with a reduction of property taxes for education would be a more
reliable way to fund education.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and the Cook County Board of
Commissioners call upon the Governor, and the leaders of the House and Senate to seriously consider
revising the income tax structure to ensure that everyone pays their fair share of income tax; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a suitable copy of this Resolution be tendered to the Governor of
Illinois and the members of the Illinois General Assembly.

RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, Herb Kent was born on October 5, 1928, he was raised on Chicago’s South Side spending
his teenage years in the Ida B. Wells Housing project drawing his early inspiration from the Rhythm and
Blues clubs that were central to the fabric of the community. Amazingly he has been an invariable
presence on Chicago radio for an astounding 65 years; and
WHEREAS, in 1944 as a high school student Herb Kent began his radio career hosting a classical music
program for WBEZ/Chicago while his participation in a local theatre company fine tuned his
improvisational skills needed for radio. By 1952, Herb Kent was working for WGES, Chicago’s largest
black oriented station where he developed his signature style and format which he calls dusty records,
defined as records that are not in the store anymore but music that takes you back to a particular place in
time; and
WHEREAS, Black music had an enormous impact on American society, and black disc jockeys played a
pivotal role in promoting black artistry and talent. Herb Kent would play advanced copies of new
releases exposing such artist as the Temptations, Smokey Robinson, and the Four Tops helping them to
build a national audience through his huge following of loyal fans and his play lists would be copied by
other stations; and
WHEREAS, in the 1960s Herb Kent introduced Chicago to the civil rights issues and Motown music, he
dedicated 15 minutes of every program to a stay in school segment and continues to work with the
community toward creating programs that create a productive environment for youth. He took to the
airwaves after Dr. M. L. King was assassination and fielded calls from distraught listeners; and
WHEREAS, Herb Kent is a longtime resident of Chicago’s Bronzeville community and serves as an
inspiration to many African American broadcasters, he is known as the Mayor of Bronzeville, The King
of Dusties, and The Cool Gent, nicknames that he has picked up throughout his remarkable career. He
has influenced his profession nationally and has been honored with many awards; he was inducted into
the Radio Hall of Fame in 1995, had a Chicago South Side street dedicated in his honor in 1996, and was
recognized by a U.S postage stamp bearing his likeness. In 1997, Herb Kent was named honorary Mayor
of Bronzeville by the citizens of the South Side community.

DAVID R. RAMOS, SR., Executive Director,
Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management
requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners to transfer funds totaling $95,000.00 from the 695 –
Cook County Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management (DHSEM) Reserve Fund
Balance to the (565-130) – Cook County Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management
(DHSEM) Salaries and Wages of Extra Employees account and the (527-550) – Cook County Department
of Homeland Security and Emergency Management (DHSEM) Automotive Equipment account.

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
It became apparent that the receiving accounts would need an infusion of funds on August 13,
2009. The account balance on that date was $123,195.00, and was the same 30 days before that.

2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
The 695 - DHSEM Reserve Fund Balance was identified as a funding source because it is the
respective department by which all DHSEM grant reimbursements and credits from prior fiscal
years have been held.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from:
None.

4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
The 695 - DHSEM Reserve Fund Balance is the respective department by which all DHSEM grant
reimbursements and credits from prior fiscal years have been held; there are no items budgeted to
its respective accounts and is solely used to accept and hold all grant reimbursements and credits
from government municipalities (local, state, federal) for DHSEM.

Highways, with the increasing repair cost the account was depleted. Heavy equipment has not been
purchased since Fiscal Year 2004.

TRANSFER OF FUNDS
ITEM #32
APPROVED
Transmitting a Communication, dated October 22, 2009 from
NANCY L. JONES, M.D., Chief Medical Examiner, Office of the Medical Examiner
requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners to transfer funds totaling $34,000.00 from and to the
accounts listed below, for the purchase of goods and materials for the Office of the Medical Examiner.
Reason:

These requests are presented in order to obtain sufficient funding for the contracts continuing
into FY 2010 that are listed under the Contractual Maintenance Services and Office Supplies
accounts. Specifically, the Dayspring Janitorial Services contract would require
$238,298.00 to cover FY 2010 expenses on this 2-year contract. Therefore, with only
$250,000.00 requested for this account 259-235, which also covers exterminating,
landscaping, and snow/ice removal services, the Office intends to encumber remaining funds
to use in FY 2010. Similarly, the office supply account is also an account which is
underfunded. With a request of $35,000.00 for FY 2010, we hope to encumber some funds
on the Countywide Office Depot contract to use in FY 2010 to offset the potential shortfall
that we may have once the FY 2010 budget for 259-350 is finalized and approved. These
fund transfers will helps us substantially as we maintain the operations of the Office of the
Medical Examiner.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
The amount of purchases from the 260 - Professional and Managerial Services Account fluctuates
from year to year. However, due to this surplus we have adjusted the FY2010 request to reflect this
account's decreased spending.
The amount of purchases from the 355 - Photographic and Reproduction Supplies fluctuates from
year to year. Additionally, since this department has gone digital (eliminating film and processing
charges), the costs incurred by this department have also decreased. Due to this surplus, we have
adjusted our FY2010 request to reflect this account's decreased spending.
The amount of purchases from the 388 - Computer Operations Supplies fluctuates from year to
year. Given that the volume of cases will change from year to year, our need for these supplies will
vary. Additionally, with the number of employees utilizing computers this will also cause a
variation in the costs incurred. However, due to this surplus we have adjusted the FY2010 request
to reflect this account's decreased spending.
The amount of purchases from the 630 - Rental of Office Equipment Account fluctuates from year
to year based on the equipment rented by the department. Due to this surplus, we have adjusted our

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations?
On October 7th a thorough review was made of each of the non-personnel line items.
What was the balance in the account on that date, and what was the balance 30 days prior to that
date?
Transportation and Other Travel Expenses for Employees: The balance was $96,592.00. The
invoices not sent to the comptroller's office totaled approximately $25,000.00. It was estimated this
account needed another $10,000.00. The balance in this account September 7th was $53,912.00
(during October an error by the comptroller's department was corrected which increased the balance
approximately $38,000.00 and the last transfer of funds added $23,000.00 to this account).
Expert Witnesses: The balance was $263,350.00. Invoices not sent to the comptroller's office were
in excess of $120,000.00. This account typically sees a lot of activity at year-end when expert's
start sending in invoices. It was estimated an additional $65,000.00 was needed in this account.
The balance September 7th was $363,778.00.
Court Reporting, Stenographic, Transcribing, or Interpreter Services: The balance was
$142,902.00. Invoices not sent to the comptroller's office totaled $139,683.00. It was estimated
another $69,000.00 was needed to meet year-end. The balance in the account September 7th was
$12,377.00 before the addition of $143,000.00 from the last transfer of funds.
Office Supplies: The balance was $1,240.00. It was estimated this account required an additional
$5,000.00 to cover invoices not at the comptroller's office. The balance September 7th was
$19,666.00.
Computer Operation Supplies: The balance was $5,167.00. It was necessary to order supplies that
totaled $8,000.00. It was estimated this account needed $10,000.00 added to cover the order and
any other last minute needs. The balance September 7th was $9,917.00.
Maintenance and Repair of Automotive Equipment: The balance was $499.00. There are a couple
of invoices that had not been sent over to the comptroller's office. It was estimated that this account
needed an additional $5,000.00 to cover the outstanding invoice and any other items that may
occur. The balance September 7th was $184.00 (before account was increased $3,000.00 with the
last transfer of funds).
Rental Facilities: The balance was $5,007.00. We are experiencing a system problem affecting the
balance remaining in the account and are concerned if it does not get fixed we will need to pay a
month or two of invoices between FY2009 and FY2010 with a payment only request and therefore,
we need to add $5,000.00 to this account. The balance on September 7th was $5,007.00.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? The accounts were
identified in the analysis completed on October 7th.

Maintenance & Repair of Data Processing Equipment & Software: The previous administration
planned for a county wide contract that was also planned elsewhere.
Books, Periodicals, Publications, Archives and Data Services: The office has received several
checks for an overpayment in 2008 totaling $14,000.00.
Professional and Managerial Services: The previous administration planned to use a consultant for
our Legal Edge activities however it has since been decided there isn't a need for additional
spending over the 2008 PO. The consultant will be used in 2010 and sufficient funds have been
budgeted for this.
The amounts from Photography and Reproduction Supplies; Rental of Office Equipment, and
Operations of Auto Equipment are fairly minimal.

requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners to transfer funds totaling $716.00 from Account 130630, Rental of Office Equipment to Account 130-388, Computer Operation Supplies for a negative
balance.
Reason:

Transfer of Funds is needed to cover a negative balance in the 130-388 Computer Operation
Supplies Account because the Recorder of Deeds Technology department needed computers,
printers and workstations.

From Account 130-630

Total

$716.00

To Account 130-388

Total

$716.00

1.

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
It was apparent that the receiving account 130-388 would require a transfer of funds in order to
meet current obligations on August 1, 2009. The balance in this account was a negative amount of
$716.00 and the balance (30) days prior to that was also a negative $716.00.

2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
This Account 130-630 was used for a source of transfer because of the unencumbered balance
remaining in this account.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from
(None) no purchases, programs, contract or other obligation will be deferred or delayed in this
account.

4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
A surplus exists in account 130-630 Rental of Office Equipment because the Recorder's office
wasn't able to find space to house our Microfilm and Tract Books. The Microfilm and Tract Books
remained in the lower level basement of the Recorder of Deeds office funds were not incurred.
