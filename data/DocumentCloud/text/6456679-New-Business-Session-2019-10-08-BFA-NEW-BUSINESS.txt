COMMISSION ACTION

Procurement Department completed a quick bid for Labor, Materials and Equipment for
the Removal and Installation of the Condenser Pumps. The emergency repair cost
requires an amendment to the Capital Outlay budget.

An Invitation for Bid (IFB), was posted on website and sent to the
MITN (Michigan Inter-Governmental Trade Network) on June 13, 2019. The solicitation
period was from June 13, 2019 until bid closing at 2:00 pm. on June 25, 2019, at which
time the bid documents were no longer available for download. The bid was
downloaded from the MITN website by fifteen (15) contractors. Seven (7) companies

Services Group for a total cost not to exceed $77,000.

engineering services and oversee the construction management to ensure proper installation of
