Sec. 66-58. General requirements and provisions.
Any License granted pursuant to this Ordinance creates a license only and does not create an interest or
estate of any kind whatsoever in the Public Way by virtue of this Ordinance, a License Agreement, or
Grantee's use of the Public Way.
(a) Existing facilities. In the event that any Person is operating Facilities in the Public Way under a
license, easement or similar agreement with the County, thi s Ordinance shall apply only to the extent it is
not inconsistent with such license, easement or similar agreement during the term of such license,
easement or similar agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Ordinance, including but not limited
to permitting requirements of this Ordinance, shall govern any maintenance, repair, replacement, removal,
relocation, reconstruction, upgrading, modification or extension of any existing Facilities, and all the
provisions of this Ordinance shall apply to installation of any new Facilities in the Public Ways not
covered by such agreement. Persons having Facilities located in the Public Ways as of the Effective Date
for which a License is required under Section 66-57, and as to which no license, easement or similar
written agreement is currently in effect, shall comply with the licensing requirements set forth herein by
filing an application for a License for such existing Facilities within 60 days after the Effective Date. The
effective date of such License Agreement shall be July 1, 2007. If a Person having existing Facilities with
no such agreement in place fa ils to timely apply for or diligently pursue a License Agreement, then the
County may exercise the rights and remedies described in this Ordinance, including assessment of
penalties and requiring removal of such Person's Facilities. In addition, the County may refuse to process
any Applications or grant any Permits until such License Agreement is executed.
(b) Ordinance 85-0-18. On February 4, 1985, the Board adopted Ordinance No. 85-0-1 8, which
granted to Illinois Bell Telephone Company, and its successors, the non-exclusive right to use Public
Ways in unincorporated Cook County in exchange for certain benefits granted to the County, under the
terms set forth in such Ordinance. For so long as such Ordinance is in full force and effect, the grantee
under such Ordinance or its successors shall not be required to apply for a License in accordance with this
Ordinance as to Public Ways in unincorporated Cook County, but, consistent with Ordinance No. 85-018, shall be required to comply with all Permit requirements set forth in Division 3, except that Permit
fees shall be waived to the extent provided in such Ordinance, as amended.
(c) License non-exclusive. No License shall be exclusive. Every License shall be deemed to reserve
to the County the right to grant other Licenses to use and occupy the Public Ways or other property of the
County for any other purpose on such terms as the County may deem appropriate.
(d) License subject to County use. A ll Licenses shall be subject to the County's use of its Public
Ways, including the widening of County highways, roads, streets and bridges. Any removal, relocation or
modification of a Grantee's Facilities necessitated by the County's use of its Public Ways shall be at the
Grantee's cost, and shall be governed by Section 66-81.

Sec. 66-59. License application.
Applications for a License shall be submitted to the Director on application forms promulgated by
the Director. The app lication form shall request facts and information the County deems appropriate,
including the specific location of the Facilities as provided in Section 66-55. Applicants applying for a
License for Facilities existing prior to the Effective Date, shall include drawings, plans and specifications
fully describing such existing Facilities and the location of such Facilities as required by Section 66-55.
The Director may agree to accept the foregoing information after issuance of a License for good cause
shown. If a License as to all the Public Ways is requested, the information as to the current locations of
Faci lities shall nevertheless be required. The Director may request additional information from the
Applicant at any time during the application process.

1439

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 18, 2007

(a) Review process. The Director shall coordinate any necessary review of the application by all
interested County Departments, which may include Highway, Building and Zoning and Risk
Management. If the foregoing review indicates that the License may be issued, then based upon the
application and such information as may be obtained during the review process, the Director shall prepare
a License Agreement for execution by the Applicant, setting forth the terms and conditions upon which
the Director is prepared to recommend issuance of a License.
(b) Execution by applicant. Upon execution of the License Agreement, Applicant shall submit the
Annual License Fee for the first year of the term. Such Annual License Fee shall be refunded if the
License Agreement is not approved and executed by the Board. No provision of this Ordinance shall be
deemed or construed as to require the Board to grant a License. The Board may consider any relevant
facts and circumstances, including the qualifications of the Applicant, in determining whether to grant a
License.
(c) Term of License Agreement. The term of a License Agreement shall commence on the date the
License Agreement is executed by the County ("Effective Date"), and shall expire on June 30 of the
calendar year in which the tenth (10th) anniversary of the Effective Date occurs, such that all Licenses
shall expire on June 30, unless sooner terminated in accordance with the terms of the License Agreement;
provided, however, that a License Agreement issued to a Person having Existing Facilities as described in
Section 66-58 (a) shall be effective as of July 1, 2007, regardless of the date executed.
Sec. 66-60. Annual requirements.

(a) A Grantee is required to provide the following documentation to the Director prior to each July 1
falling within the term:
(1) A current certificate of insurance evidencing all insurance required to be maintained by

(2) The annual License fee in effect from time to time.
(3) A certified report of current Facilities and their locations, including plans, drawings or such
other material as is necessary to fully describe the Facilities and their locations, as provided

stating that there has been no change to the Facilities since the prior annual report or the
issuance of the License, in the case of the first such certified report.
(4) A certified report detailing the nature and location of all maintenance and repair work
covered by the Annual Maintenance and Repair Permit under Section 66-67 (a).
(5) Payment of the applicable fee for the Annual Maintenance and Repair Permit.
(6) Such other documentation and information reasonably requested by the Director.

1440

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 18, 2007

(b) Failure to fulfill annual requirements. If Grantee fails to fulfill the annual requirements by July
1, Grantee shall be subject to penalties as set forth in Section 66-91 and, in addition, the Director may
revoke the License at any time thereafter by terminating the License Agreement as set forth below;
provided, however, that if Grantee provides the certificate of insurance and pays the annual fee by within
five (5) days after receipt of notice from the County of failure to comply with the annual requirements
(which shall constitute a violation notice under Section 66-87), Grantee may request an extension as to
Section 66-60 (a) (3) and 66-60 (a) (4) and the Director may grant such extension as the Director deems
appropriate (which shall constitute additional time to cure pursuant to Section 66-88 (c)). If such
extension is granted, no penalties will accrue and the County will not be entitled to revoke the License if
the requirement is fulfilled prior to the expiration of the extension period. If Grantee fails to provide the
annual report within the extension period, then penalties shall be assessed retroactively to the date which
is five days after receipt of the County' s notice, and the Director may, in his or her discretion, revoke the
License. If the Director deems it advisable to revoke the License as allowed under this Section 66-60 (b),
the Director shall notify the Grantee in writing not less than thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of

The Annual Planned Construction List shall include, at a minimum, the proposed location of each project,
the nature of each project, the anticipated schedule of each project, anticipated disruptions to the Public
Way and the length of time such disruptions will occur, and will also include such other information as is
requested by the Highway Department. The Annual Planned Construction List is required to faci litate
planning by the Highway Department and does not replace the Permit process. If a Grantee is required to
file an Annual Planned Construction List for a particular calendar year due to the applicability of (i)
above and fails to do so, the Highway Department may withhold Permits applied for until such Annual
Planned Construction List is received. If a Grantee that would be required to file an Annual Planned
Construction List due to the applicability of (ii) above, in fact applies for more than three Permits in such
calendar year, the Highway Department may withhold the Pennits applied for after such third Pem1it until
the Annual Planned Construction List for such year is filed.

grounds for cancellation of a Tree Trimming Permit and imposition of penalties.

Sec. 66-69. Emergency work.
In the event of an emergency as described in Section 66-85 requiring work to be done which would
otherwise require a Permit, a Grantee may perform the work required to remove any hazard, restore
service, or repair, replace or remove Facilities, provided that telephonic notice is given to the Highway
Department prior to such work and further provided that the appropriate Permits are applied for and the
appropriate Permit fees paid within ten days after the occurrence requiring the work. Telephonic notice
may be provided on a 24-hour basis, seven days per week at the Cook County Highway Department
Maintenance Facility, 24 hour contact number, which is currently 708-485-7 130. Failure to apply for such
Permit and pay the appropriate fees shall be grounds for imposition of penalties beginning upon the
commencement of the work. If the nature of the work required is such as to require the parking on the
shoulder of equipment required in repair operations, adequate signs and lights shall be provided, pursuant
to the " Manual on Unifonn Traffic Control Devices", issued by the Federal Highway Administration.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 18, 2007

Sec. 66-71. Effect of permit.
A Permit from the County authorizes a Grantee to undertake only certain activities on the Public
Ways in accordance with this Ordinance and as specifically contained in such Permit, and does not create
a property right or grant authority to the Grantee to impinge upon the rights of the County or others who
may have an interest in the Public Ways. Projects may require a Grantee to apply for more than one type
of Permit; for example, certain construction projects might require not only a Construction Permit but, if
trimming or removal of trees is necessary for the project, would also require a Tree Trimming Permit. The
issuance of a Permit does not excuse the Grantee from complying with other requirements of the County
and all applicable Laws.

Sec. 66-72. Notice of commencement of work.
After issuance of a Permit, and not less than forty-eight (48) hours prior to commencing any
construction, a Grantee shall file w ith the Highway Department a notice describing the project and date
and time construction is planned to commence.

Sec. 66-73. Notice - telecommunication carriers.
Telecommunications carriers shall be subj ect to the licensing requirements (except as specifically
provided otherwise in this Ordinance) and shall be subject to Permit requirements of this Ordinance;
provided, however, that a License and a Permit may be issued retroactively for work already performed if
the following requirements are met. Pursuant to Section 4 of the Telephone Company Act, 220 ILCS
6514, in the event that License and Permit requirements are not fully satisfied prior to the scheduled
commencement of work governed by this Ordinance and necessary for the provision of
telecommunications services, then the telecommunications carrier shall notify the Highway Department
that it intends to commence such work ("Commencement of Work N otice").
(a) The Commencement of Work Notice shall consist of plans, specifications, and other
documentation sufficient to demonstrate the purpose and intent of the work and the desired location of the
work, and shall be provided by the telecommunications carrier not less than ten (I 0) days prior to the
commencement of work; provided, however, that if such work requires Excavation for new construction,
such notice sha ll be given not less than thirty (30) days prior to the commencement of work.
(b) If a Commencement of Work Notice is timely given, and if a License is in effect or applied for (if
applicable), and if a Permit is also applied for within ten (10) days after receipt of the Highway
Department's spec ification of location described in Section 66-73 (a), then no penalties shall be imposed
for fa ilure to obtain a License and Pennit prior to perfonni ng the work. If no Commencement of Work
Notice is timely given, or if a Permit application is not completed and submitted to the Highway
Department within the ten (10) day period fo llowing the Highway Department's specification described
in Section 66-72 (a), penalties may be imposed for failure to obtain a License and Permit commencing
upon the date the te lecommunications carrier begins work in the Public Way, as applicable in accordance
with this Ordinance, and shall continue to accrue until a License and Permit are issued or, if the
application is denied, until the Facilities are removed.

1445

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 18, 2007

(c) The Highway Department shall specify the portion of the Public Way upon which the Facility
may be placed, used and constructed. In the event that the Highway Department fails to provide such
specification of location to the telecommunications retailer within either (i) ten (I 0) days after service of
notice by the telecommunications retailer in the case of work not involving Excavation for new
construction or (ii) twenty-five (25) days after service of notice by the telecommunications retailer in the
case of work involving Excavation for new construction, the telecommunications retailer may commence
work, but shall diligently pursue the issuance of a License and Permit under this Ordinance.

Sec. 66-74. Modification of permit.
If after issuance of a Permit and before or during construction a Grantee determines that it is
necessary or desirable to revise the size or location of the proposed Facilities, or to make a material
change in the permitted Facilities, Grantee shall apply to the Highway Department for a modification to
its Permit, and shall furnish all requested information and pay the applicable modification fee such that
the Highway Department can take action on such request. Failure to apply for a modification shall
constitute grounds for imposition of penalties from the date of commencement of construction to the date
upon which a Permit modification is granted or the Facility is removed in accordance with Section 66-91.

Sec. 66-75. Completion of work; as built drawings.
Upon completion of construction, every Grantee shall submit to the Highway Department within
thirty (30) days an "as built" set of drawings or plans conforming to the requirements of Section 66-55. If
"as built" drawings or plans contain Proprietary Information , as defined in Section 66-55, Grantee may
provide alternate plans reasonably acceptable to the Highway Department in order to describe the location
of Facilities, so long as Grantee fulfills the other requirements of Section 66-55 ( c). The as built drawings
or plans shall identify specifically where the design, specifications and locations of the as built Facilities
deviate from that approved in the Permit, as the Permit may have been modified pursuant to Section 6674; provided, however, that Grantee is required to apply for a Permit modification for any deviation prior
to construction. If no prior modification was applied for, then in addition to the possible imposition of
penalties as set forth in Section 66-74, the County may either grant a modification of the Permit, with
payment of applicable fees for modification, or if the County denies the request for a modification, then
the Grantee shall either remove the Facility from the Public Way or modify the Facility so that it
conforms to the Permit and submit revised drawings or plans therefore. Failure to remove or modify the
Facility shall subject Grantee to the penalties set forth in Section 66-91.

Sec. 66-76. Inspections.
All work by a Grantee in the Public Way sha ll be subject to inspection by the County during
construction and upon completion of construction. The County has no obligation to inspect, and the extent
of any inspection shall be as determined by the Highway Department. A Grantee shall pay inspection fees
in effect from time to time. No inspection by the County shall relieve the Grantee of any of its obligations
under this Ordinance, a License Agreement, or a Permit, or of any liability to the County or any other
party, including but not limited to the indemnification and insurance provisions of this Ordinance, a
License Agreement, or a Permit.

Sec. 66-77. Change of ownership or owner's identity or legal status.
No Permit shall be assigned, transferred, sold or disposed of, in whole or in part, by voluntary sale,
sale and leaseback, merger, including merger by operation of law, consolidation or otherwise or by forced
or involuntary sale (any of the foregoing being hereinafter referred to as a " Permit Transfer"), without
written notice to the Superintendent which shall be signed by both the original Grantee and the party
accepting the Transfer (the "Permit Transferee"). Such notice shall be given no later than ten (I 0) days
after the Permit Transfer occurs, and shall include an assumption by the Permit Transferee of all the
Grantee's obligations under the Permit. If the Highway Department is still holding a restoration bond or a
Jetter of credit under the Permit, then the Pennit Transferee shall simultaneously provide evidence of
Perm it Transferee 's insurance and a replacement bond or letter of credit provided by Transferee. The
Permit Transferee shall have all the obligations and privileges enjoyed by the former owner, under the
Permit and sha ll be subject to all applicable Laws, including this Ordinance, w ith respect to the work and
Facilities in the Public Way. If the parties fail to transfer the Permit to its name, such failure shall be
cause for the imposition of penalties on the Permit Transferee and the Pennit Transferee shall be
presumed to have accepted, and agreed to be bound by, the terms and conditions of the Permit. Any such
transfer of ownership or change in identity of the Grantee may also require a transfer of License or
application for a new License by the Permit Transferee, pursuant to Divis ion 2.
Division 4. General Construction Standards and Operational Requirements

Sec. 66-78. Consistent with laws.
All design, location, construction, reconstruction, upgrading, replacement, relocation, removal,
modification , maintenance and operation of Facilities, traffic control, protection of vegetation and all
operations in the Public Way by or on behalf of any Grantee shall be consistent with Laws, and
commonly recognized and accepted traffic control and construction principles, sound design and
engineering judgment and, where applicable, the principles and standards set forth in the Federal
regulations and Illinois Department of Transportation publications, including but not limited to the
Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction, and the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control
Devices issued by the Federal Highway Administration, as all such Laws and requirements may be
updated or amended from time to time. All work in the Public Way shall be performed in a good and safe
workmanlike manner using high quality materials. All Facilities shall be maintained in good repair and
sound condition and in accordance with all Laws.

Sec. 66-79. Operational restrictions.
In no event shall a Grantee place or allow to remain in the Public Way any rocks, boulders, debris,
equipment or other material other than as specifically allowed pursuant to an applicable Permit. The
Highway Department may require a Grantee to discontinue construction operations in Public Ways when,
in the sole judgment of the Highway Department, such operations may create hazards to traffic or the
public health, safety, and welfare or when conditions are such that construction may result in damage to
the Public Way or other property. Other regulations and requirements regarding construction activities,
such as hours of construction, shall be determined by the Highway Department.

accordance with the Illinois Underground Facilities Damage Prevention Act.
Sec. 66-81. Information on location of facilities; relocation of permitted facilities.
As a condition of issuance of Licenses and Permits, Grantees shall be required to fully cooperate with
the Highway Department and its contractors and consultants for purposes of planning, designing,
construction or maintenance by the Highway Department. Such cooperation includes attending
coordination meetings, providing information and relocating Facilities as further described in this Section
66-81. The obligations set forth in this Section 66-81, and in the remainder of this Ordinance, shall apply
not only to utilities and private users of the Public Way, but also to municipalities and political
subdivisions.
(a) Information on location of facilities. Within sixty (60) days after written request from the
Highway Department, a Grantee shall provide accurate information as to the location of Facilities within
the Public Way, as provided in Section 66-55. Such sixty (60) day period may be extended for thirty (30)
days, or such additional period as is detennined by the Superintendent, if Grantee notifies County in
writing that additional time is required to provide such information, so long as Grantee has diligently
commenced and diligently proceeds to gather such infonnation . A Grantee 's inaccurate, incomplete, or
lack of knowledge or regarding the location of Facilities or other requested infonnation shall not excuse it
from the requirements of this Ordinance. Grantees shall have an affirmative obligation to obtain and
provide accurate and complete information in a timely manner, as specified herein.
(b) Removal or relocation due to County 's use. Within ninety (90) days following the later of (i)
written notice from the Highway Department, and (ii) issuance of a Permit for the following work, a

remove its Facilities within the applicable time frames, or any extended time upon which the County and
the Grantee shall agree in writing, then in addition to any other remedies available at law or in equity,
such failure shall constitute grounds for imposition of a penalty for delay in accordance with Section 6691 plus any damages incurred by the County by reason of such delay, including but not limited to
additional amounts owed contractors in order for them to complete work which was delayed due to the
failure of the Grantee to provide accurate and complete infonnation or timely remove or relocate its
Facilities. If so requested by the County, the Grantee must immediately provide corrected information or
corrective action, including providing a schedule for such necessary corrective actions to be subject to the
County's approval.

modification or removal, as well as any damages incurred by reason of such delay and any penalties
assessed pursuant to this Ordinance, from any bond, letter of credit or other security provided on behalf of
the Grantee. Failure of a Grantee to timely relocate Faci lities may be a basis for denial of future Permits

maintains any unauthorized Facility or related appurtenances within the Public Way shall, at its own
expense, remove all or any part of such Facilities or appurtenances from the Public Way. If the owner of
the Facility is unknown to the County, such thirty (30) day notice may be given by means of posting at
the location of the Facility. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such thirty (30) day notice shall not be

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 18, 2007

Sec. 66-83. Abandonment of facilities.
(a) When a Grantee determines to abandon a Facility within the Public Way, the Grantee shall notify
the Highway Department as soon as reasonably practicable, and prior to such abandonment, if possible,
but in no event later than ninety (90) days after such abandonment. In addition to the foregoing, the
Highway Department may notify a Grantee that the Highway Department reasonably believes that a
Facility has been abandoned, in which case the Grantee shall have thirty (30) days in which to provide
reasonable written evidence that the Facility has not been abandoned prior any further action being taken
by the Highway Department. If the Highway Department is not satisfied with the evidence provided, the
Highway Department will notify the Grantee in writing that the evidence was not deemed adequate and
the Facility has been determined by the Highway Department to have been abandoned.
(b) Following receipt of notice of abandonment from a Grantee, or if a Grantee fails to provide
reasonable written evidence within thirty (30) days after notice from the Highway Department that the
Facility has not been abandoned, the Highway Department may direct the Grantee to remove all or any
portion of the Facility if the Highway Department determines that such removal will be in the best interest
of the public health, safety and welfare. Any such removal includes restoration of the Public Way as
provided in Section 66-84.
(c) As to removal of abandoned Facilities pursuant to this Division 4, the Highway Department shall
provide a reasonable time frame within which Grantee shall be required to obtain a Permit and remove
such Facilities and restore the Public Way; provided, however, that in no event shall such time frame
exceed ninety (90) days following the later to occur of (i) written notice from the Highway Department,
and (ii) issuance of a Permit for the following work, unless a longer period is granted by the Highway
Department, in its sole discretion. Failure to remove such Facilities and restore the Public Way within the
specified time frame shall be grounds for the imposition of penalties set forth in the Ordinance. If the
Highway Department does not direct the Grantee that abandoned the Facility to remove it, then the
abandoning Grantee shall be deemed to have consented to the alteration or removal of all or any portion
of the Facility and any necessary restoration of the Public Way by the Highway Department or another
Person, at the Grantee's expense. 1f the Grantee fails to promptly reimburse the County, the County may
recover the cost from any bond, letter of credit or other security provided on behalf of the Grantee.

and to the satisfaction of the Highway Department. This obligation includes restoration of entrances and
side roads. Restoration and replacement shall be made us ing materials and methods approved by the
Highway Department and restored to such standards as may be established by the Highway Department.
Such cleanup and restoration may be required to consist of backfilling, regrading, repaving, reseeding,
resodding, or any other requirement of the Highway Department to restore the Public Way to a condition
substantially equivalent to that which existed prior to the commencement of the project. Reseeding and
resodding shall not be considered completed unless and until such reseeding or resodding results in
successful, living grass, which may require watering and other care until established. Failure of a Grantee
to timely and fully clean up and restore, to the County 's satisfaction, shall constitute grounds for
imposition of penalties in accordance with this Ordinance. In addition to any imposition of penalties, the
County may perform such clean up and restoration at the Grantee's cost and, if Grantee fails to promptly
reimburse the County, may recover the cost from any bond, letter of credit or other security provided on
behalf of the Grantee. The County's cost of clean up and restoration shall include overhead costs,

provided that for violations (other than the payment of money and defaults described in Sections 66-87 (f)

shall have such additional period to cure as described in Section 66-88 (c) below.

PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT

WHEREAS, it is crucial that the people of the County of Cook have trust, respect and confidence in
those who are elected to public office; and
WHEREAS, it is equally crucial that the citizenry have absolute faith in the integrity of the e lectoral
process by which our public officials are chosen; and
WHEREAS, to accomplish this, the County of Cook has adopted certain rules and regulations including
campaign finance laws that establish, among other things, limitation s on the amounts of pol itical
contributions that may be made by individuals and entities doing business with the County, registered
lobbyists and other entities that have an interest in influencing the policies and decisions of County
government; and
WHEREAS, these laws limit the amount of money that such individuals and entities may contribute to
candidates for public office to $1,500 during a single candidacy and $3 ,000 during an election year; and
WHEREAS , it is the intent of the elected officials within the County of Cook to reduce the ability of
entities to brazenly ignore these limitations, thereby restoring faith in the integrity of the electoral process
and the candidates who might otherwise benefit from these abuses; and
WHEREAS, the County of Cook wishes to strengthen its campaign finance Jaws to prevent persons or
entities with a financial or other interest in the decisions made by County government from attempting to
manipulate the County's campaign finance laws through cynically clever and circuitous financing and
contribution methods; and
WHEREAS, this ordinance is intended to put an end to this untenable situation, to close any rea l or
perceived loopholes, and to avoid future abuses of the County ' s campaign finance laws by the very
people these laws were intended to constrain.

PROPOSED RESOLUTIONS

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, the governor's "gross receipts tax plan" is a massive tax on Illinois goods and services; and
WHEREAS, this tax comes off the top of what an employer takes in, whether a company is making a
profit or losing money; and
WHEREAS, although the tax is being sold to the public as one that only impacts business entities
bringing in over $ 1 million per year in gross revenues, these costs will be passed along to consumers
regardless of income, thus making it a regressive tax that hurts everyone, particularly those with limited
means; and

1468

 JOURNAL OF PROCEED TNGS FOR APRIL 18, 2007

WHEREAS, the repetitive taxation of a single item would drive up the cost of doing business in Cook
County, thus costing Cook County jobs by making products and services purchased here more expensive
and Cook County employers less competitive in the marketplace; and
WHEREAS, the gross receipts tax would result in Cook County losing citizens, consumers and tax
dollars, and have a drastic impact on our schools and healthcare facilities; and
WHEREAS, according to census population estimates, Cook County posted the third largest population
decline in the nation, losing 88,000 residents by 2001, a problem that will be exacerbated even further by
the imposition of a gross receipts tax.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and Cook County Board of
Commissioners does hereby urge the Illinois General Assembly to oppose and defeat the gross receipts
tax in order to protect the interests of Cook County consumers and residents; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners does hereby urge
Governor Rod Blagojevich to abandon this draconian tax proposal and work with members of the Illinois
General Assembly to devise a more practical means of funding state operations.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION

RESTORATION OF THE COOK COUNTY SPECIALTY REFERRAL SYSTEM
WHEREAS, on April 16, 2007, the Interim Bureau Chief of the Cook County Bureau of Health Services
(" Bureau") shut down the Bureau 's computerized specialty referral system, known as " IRI S", for an
indefinite period of time, abandoning thousands of uninsured patients in need of specia lty care for serious
illnesses such as cancer and diabetes; and
WHEREAS, for years, dozens of private community health centers partnered with the Bureau utilizing
IRIS to screen and prioritize primary care patients in need of specialty services from the Bureau 's
specialty clinics; and
WHEREAS, this cooperative partnership has saved the Bureau the cost of providing primary care to
more than 5,000 uninsured and underinsured patients in Cook County annually; and
WHEREAS, since the IRIS system shutdown, only patients in need of urgent care will be sent to Stroger
Hospital of Cook County 's main o utpatient screening center a facility notorious for long wait times; and
WHEREAS, the Interim Bureau Chief has effectively cut off thousands of patients' access to the
Bureau's specialty clinics, forcing them to delay their care until their condition worsens and they seek
emergency care at Stroger Hospital of Cook County; and
WHEREAS, shutting down the IRIS system will not only incur additiona l costs to our already deficitridden public health system, but it will cause irreparable harm to Cook County residents who have a right
to basic health care.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners directs the
Cook County Bureau of Health Services to restore the IRIS specialty referral system so that our public
health system can continue to deli ver necessary and life-saving health services to the people of Cook
County.

the light court masonry and terra cotta will be needed to maintain the safe condition of the
building, therefore extending the construction period and construction administration phase
an estimated fourteen months.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Committee on Information Technology and Automation of the Board of Commissioners of Cook
County met pursuant to notice on Monday, April 16, 2007 at the hour of l 0:00 A.M. in the Board Room,
Room 569, County Building, 118 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois.
Your Committee has considered the following items and, upon adoption of this report, the
recommendations are as follows:
285672

BUREAU OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND AUTOMATION, by Catherine
Maras O ' Leary, Chief Information Officer, transmitting a Communication:
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with IRON
MOUNTAIN, Itasca, Illinois, for off-site storage of computer media countywide.
Reason:

Through a Request for Proposal (RFP) process, Iron Mountain provided the
lowest cost solution that met with all of the County's main requirements, such as
use of metal containers, support of electronic data transmittal, and depth of
coverage faci lities, for the protection of the company records.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $210,000.00. One time purchase. (490-441 Account). Requisition
No. 74900002.

*Referred to the Committee on Information Technology and Automation on 03-20-07.
Vice Chairman Gorman, seconded by Commissioner Daley, moved to discuss Communication
Number 285672.
Stanley A. Molis, Director, Department for Management of Information Systems, remarked that this item
addresses off-site storage of data cartridges and reel tapes; pickups occur every day at multiple locations
in the County.
Commissioner Daley inquired whether this safeguarding measure is part of a larger Countywide disaster
planning effort.
Mr. Molis replied in the affirmative.
Vice Chairman Gonnan inquired as to how many companies submitted Requests for Proposals (RFPs).
Mary Jo Horace, Director, Department of Office Technology, replied that seven companies submitted
RFPs. Three companies were disqualified because they could not support operations of the size of Cook
County. The others were a higher cost than the recommended supplier.

Vice Chairman Gorman, seconded by Commissioner Daley, moved the approval of Communication
Number 285672. T he motion carried.

285946

COOK COUNTY CLERK, David Orr, by Brandon Neese, Deputy County Clerk,
transmitting a Communication:
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to increase by $206,653.90, Contract No.
05-41-650 with LANAC Technology Corporation, Chicago, Illinois, for the purchase of a
new integrated cashiering and accounting system (Phase I) and the back file conversion project
(Phase II).
Board approved amount 05-17-05:
Previous increase approved 01-18-06:
Previous increase approved I 0-17-06:
This increase requested:
Adjusted amount:
Reason:

$1,506,000.00
1,900,000.00
150,000.00
206,653.90
$3, 762,653.90

This increase is necessary due to unexpected difficulties the vendor experienced
during the indexing process, therefore requiring additional personnel to enter the
records manually. On May 17, 2005 the Board approved Phase I of this contract,
the new integrated cashiering and accounting system for the Real Estate and Tax
Services Division, Bureau of Vital Statistics, Department of Ethics and Department
of Elections. On January 18, 2006 the Board approved an amendment, extension
and increase to the original contract to add Phase II, the back file conversion
project converting 24 million birth, marriage and death records into a digitized
format. On October 17, 2006 the Board approved an increase to the contract to
scan 1.5 million additional paper records in place of film that were too poor to
image. The expiration date of the current contract is December 31, 2007.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $206,653.90. (717/ 110-579 Account).
Sufficient funds have been appropriated to cover this request.

*Referred to the Committee on Information Technology and Automation on 04-03-07.
Vice Chairman Gorman, seconded by Commissioner Daley, moved to discuss Communication No.
285946.
Chairman Beavers called on Brandon Neese, Deputy County Clerk, to provide an overview of this Item.
Mr. Neese delivered the following remarks: This project commenced several years ago. It is comprised
of two phases. The first phase is the creation of the cashiering and accounting system, which has been
installed for the entire Clerk' s Office, but primarily for the Real Estate and Tax Services Department and
the Vital Records Department. In the second phase twenty-four million vital records, from 1871 to the
present, are being scanned and digitized. These two phases will merge, and as a result, clerks will be able
to provide documents immediately and receive payment immediately. The project incurred $150,000 in
extra costs, because some microfiche had deteriorated to the point where they were not legible. Instead,
the original paper documents had to be scanned, and this was more costly. Further costs have arisen
because, in merging the 24 million index numbers with the 24 million scanned documents, duplicate
index numbers have been found. To a large extent these duplicate index numbers are from between 1911
and 1929 when births and deaths often occurred at home instead of at the hospital. When duplicates are
found, the vendor has to manually enter the second document. The cost has risen from 2 cents per
document to 5 cents per document and, in the case of marriage, 9 cents per document. The increased cost
amounts to approximately $200,000.00. As a result of this project, twenty-five positions will be
eliminated. The project is not expected to exceed its deadline by more than three months.

1589

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 18, 2007
Chairman Beavers inquired as to whether tax records will be affected.
Mr. Neese replied that he has been working on a plan with staff from the County 's information
technology areas. Many of the records have been computerized, however, the State of Illinois still
requires that the hard copy books be retained. The plan is to focus on this issue after the present project is
finished ; the goal is to have everything on computer.
Commissioner Schneider inquired whether Mr. Neese foresees at the present time the need for any
addition funds in the future .
Mr. Neese replied in the negative.
Chairman Beavers inquired whether Mr. Neese had been in touch with the Recorder of Deeds.
Mr. Neese replied in the negative, and added that the Treasurer, however, is very interested in this project.

Vice Chairman Gorman, seconded by Commissioner Daley, moved the approval of Communication
No. 285946. The motion carried.
YOUR COMMITTEE RECOMMENDS THE FOLLOWING ACTION
WITH REGARD TO THE MATTERS NAMED HEREIN:

agrees that it shall provide a 25% discount off any other services provided to the County pursuant to
tariff, including any new services that may become tariffed while the Ordinance is in effect. However,
with respect to any tariffed services other than those specifically listed above as being subject to the 50%
Discount, if the Company does not offer any discount on such services to other customers pursuant to a
franchise agreement, then such services shall be provided at the filed tariff rates without the application of
the discounts provided for in this Ordinance. Enhanced 911 services shall be provided at the filed tariff
rates without application of any discount. However, nothing contained in this Ordinance shall preclude
the County and the Company from agreeing to discounts and rates more favorable to the County. The
foregoing discounts shall apply to all County or other agencies for which the County provides services,
including the Cook County ETSB.

The Company represents and warrants that it shall also continue to apply the 50% Ordinance
discount to the extent the 50% Ordinance discount is currently provided today to any stand alone
agreement for tariffed services for the term of such agreement, so long as the Ordinance is still in place,
including the " Ameritech Usage Service Agreement between Ameritech and Cook County Government,"
dated August I, 1999 (the " Usage Agreement"). For clarification purposes, the Usage Agreement and the
50% Ordinance discount are both applicable to the County and other agencies for which the County
provides services including the Cook County ETSB. Other than as provided herein, the Company is not
required to apply the 50% Ordinance discount on top of contractual discounted rates set forth in a stand
alone agreement ("ICB") for the same tariffed services, unless the County and Company agree in writing
to the contrary.
The Company represents and warrants that the services subject to the discounts extended to the
County under the Ordinance prior to and subsequent to SBC's merger with AT&T (the " merger") have at
all times been extended by the Company, Illinoi s Bell Telephone Company, now d/b/a AT&T lllinois,
pursuant to tariffs filed by the Company with the ICC. Accordingly, the scope of each particular
discounted service set forth in Section 6 of this Ordinance has remained substantially the same prior to
and subsequent to the merger. In the event that the Company ceases providing any particular service to
its customers, where that service is subject to the discounts provided for in Section 6, then the Company
will provide the same discount to the County for a functionally equivalent service so long as the Company
provides such functionally equivalent service to any of its customers.
Beginning with the Effective Date and continuing during the first year in which the Company
provides services to the County, the County and Company agree to cause quarterly audits ("Audits") of
all charges and debits invoiced by the Company to the County to be performed. For each year thereafter
in which the Company provides services to the County, the County and Company agree to cause annual
Audits to be performed. The Audits will verify the accuracy of charges and debits, including review of
the application of all tariffed rates and verification that all agreed upon billing arrangements or discounts
are applied correctly. Each audit shall be completed no later than thirty (30) days following the expiration
of the applicable quarter or year that is the subject of the audit (the "Period"). The auditors for each Audit
shall be a County telecom analyst and a Company account team member. In the event that the Audit
determines that the County has been overcharged in any respect then credit is owed the County. Such
credit shall be applied promptly to account(s) and in amount(s) as directed by the County. In the event
that the Audit determines that the County has been undercharged in any respect then the Company shall
receive compensation for such undercharge by billing such undercharge to account(s) and in amount(s) as
directed by the County. In the event that either the total overcharges or the total undercharges total
$25,000.00 or more respectively, then either party has the right to request that a mutually agreed upon
external auditor be retained to review the Audit. County and Company may submit to the external auditor
any information relative to the Contest and the external auditor shall review and consider such

1597

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 18, 2007

information. Within sixty (60) days of initiation of the Contest, the external auditor shall advise the
County and the Company in writing of its final findings (i.e., whether the external auditor has amended
the results of the Audit relative to the Contest or not, and if the Audit has been amended, the basis for
such amendment). In the event either County or Company disagrees with the final findings of the
external auditor, it may pursue any remedy available to it at law or in equity.
Section 7. TEMPORARY RELOCATION OF STRUCTURES. The Company after five (5)
days' written notice from the governing body of the County to do so, shall remove or raise or lower its
structures temporarily to permit the moving of a building or any other object along a County highway,
provided the benefited party or parties, other than the County of Cook, shall agree to pay the Company an
amount equal to the cost of effecting such temporary changes in its structures; and provided further that,
pending the determination of such cost, the benefited party or parties shall have deposited with the
Company an amount equal to the cost as estimated by the Company. Should any amount of such deposit
remain unexpended, after deducting the cost involved, said amount shall be returned to the party making
the deposit.
Section 8. ADDITIONAL TERMINATION RIGHTS. In addition to County's right to terminate
the Ordinance for any reason as set forth in Section 1 herein, iln case the Company shall fail or neglect to
comply with any or all of the provisions of this eOrdinance (unless by unavoidable accidents, Act of God
or the public enemy, labor strikes, or unless compliance by the Company w ith such provision is
prohibited or adjudged unlawful or unreasonable by orders or judgments of the Illinois Commerce
Commission or another regulatory body having similar jurisdiction or any court of competent
jurisdiction), the County reserves the right to repeal this eOrdinance, and forfeit the rights hereby created,
provided that no such repeal or forfeiture shall exist or be claimed because of such failure or neglect, until
written notice of such failure or neglect so claimed shall have been given to the Company, and a
reasonable opportunity afforded it to comply with the provisions hereof or to prove that such compliance
already exists.
In the event the Illinois Commerce Commission or another regulatory body having similar
jurisdiction, or any court of competent jurisdiction, shall, by any final judgment, decree, order or finding,
enjoin, prohibit or adjudge unlawful or unreasonable (or disallow as a reasonable and proper operating
expense of the Company), the concession allowance and/or obligations required under the provision of
Section 6 of this eOrdinance, and the Company, pursuant thereto, may cease to make said concession
allowance and/or perform said obligations, and in that event shall notify the County in writing of its

intention to do so, then and thereupon the County, or the Company, in add ition to all other rights and
remedies allowed by law, shall have the right, upon the giving of thirty (30) days' written notice to the

privil eges, agreements and/or obligations of the County to the Company, and of the Company to the
County, arising under this Oerdinance and its acceptance by the Company shall be at an end.

rights or claims heretofore asserted by the County or the Company, or any rights or claims e ither may
hereafter assert or seek to establish with respect to the meaning, validity or application of the prior
