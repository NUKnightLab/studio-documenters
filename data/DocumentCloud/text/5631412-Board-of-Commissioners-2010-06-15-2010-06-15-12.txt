To the Honorable Board of Commissioners:
RECOMMENDATION
It is recommended that the Board of Commissioners authorize the Chief Executive
Officer or his designee to execute a grant agreement with the 2016 Fund for Chicago
Neighborhoods (“2016 Fund”) in the amount of $12,001,171, increase the comprehensive
budget by $12,001,171 and amend existing agreements with CHA’s contracted case
management and workforce providers in an aggregate amount not-to-exceed $12,001,171
to provide 900 CHA youth and 500 CHA adults with job training, skill development and
employment opportunities through the JobStart Transitional Jobs Program (“JobStart”).
FUNDING
N/A
EXPLANATION
In May 2010, CHA received notice of an award of $12,001,171 from the 2016 Fund to
provide 900 CHA youth ages 16 – 21, with an emphasis on 16-17 year-olds, and 500
TANF eligible CHA adults ages 18 – 61 with job training, skill development and
employment opportunities through JobStart.
The JobStart program is funded for residents in selected neighborhoods throughout the
City of Chicago that would have been impacted by the economic opportunities (e.g. job
development) resulting from the 2016 Olympics had Chicago been selected as the host
city. CHA residents residing in the following community areas will be eligible for
participation in JobStart: Near West Side; East Garfield Park; Lower West Side; North
Lawndale; South Lawndale; Near South Side; Douglas; Oakland; Grand Boulevard;
Kenwood; Washington Park; Woodlawn; and Englewood. Related youth and adult
employment opportunities (e.g. Put Illinois to Work, Youth Ready Chicago) will be
available for residents who do not reside in these eligible community areas.
CHA will amend thirteen (13) existing contracts to provide job training and employment
opportunities to CHA youth and adults at worksites throughout Chicago (e.g. community
organizations and other private and public employer partners):

CHA residents participating in JobStart will receive workforce services including job
readiness training, a subsidized job placement through September 30 and supportive
services (e.g. transportation and child care assistance). Upon completion of the
subsidized placement, participants will receive unsubsidized placement assistance and
continued retention services through their FamilyWorks case management provider.
CHA will contract with an external vendor to ensure all contractor payrolls are processed
accurately and timely.
Based on the foregoing, it is in the best interest of CHA to execute a grant agreement
with the 2016 Fund for Chicago Neighborhoods in an amount of $12,001,171, increase
the comprehensive budget by $12,001,171 and enter into sub-grant agreements with
CHA’s contracted case management and workforce providers in an aggregate amount

adults with job training, skill development and employment opportunities through the
