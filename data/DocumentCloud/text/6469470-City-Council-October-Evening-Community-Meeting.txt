Dear Dr. Anderson:

On behalf of SAY Detroit, I am writing to offer our full assistance in purchasing and
installing Outdoor Exercise Equipment (8 ?stations?) and Cedar fencing in the northeast
quadrant in the Three Mile-Munich Park. The costs, approximating $72,000 are being

home by the group mentioned above.

These improvements will take place on September 26, 2019. We have worked with
community representatives to ensure these improvements are desired.

Like any other city park, the park will be maintained by the City of Detroit for the next
?ve years.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
Sincerely,

WW
