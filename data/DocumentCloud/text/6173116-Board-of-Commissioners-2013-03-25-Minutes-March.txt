Cepeda and the voting was as follows:
Ayes:
Deverra Beverly
Adela Cepeda
Mark Cozzi
Dr. Mildred Harris
Harriet Johnson
Myra King
John Markowski
Z. Scott
Nays:

None

There being no questions or discussion, Chairwoman Scott thereupon declared said Motion
carried and said resolutions adopted.
Commissioner Adela Cepeda, Chairwoman of the Finance Committee, then presented the
following report. Per Commissioner Cepeda, a Joint Finance and Tenant Services Committee
meeting was held on Wednesday, March 13, 2013 at approximately 1:00 p.m. at the CHA
Corporate Offices. Since there was not a quorum for either committee, committee members
were briefed on items appearing on the agenda, however, for the record, no votes were taken.
Linda Riley Mitchell, Chief Financial Officer presented the Committee with the Interim
Financial Report as of December 31, 2012 and the February 2013 Treasury and Cash Flow
Report.
On behalf of the Joint Finance and Tenant Services Committee members, Commissioner Cepeda
presented a Motion for the approval of the December 12, 2012 Finance Committee Meeting and
the February 13, 2013 Joint Finance and Tenant Services Committee meeting. The Motion to
approve the Minutes was seconded by Commissioner Cozzi and was approved by unanimous
vote.
Commissioner Cepeda then presented an Omnibus Motion for the following six items discussed
at the Committee meeting:
6

 (Item No. B1)
The resolution for Item B1 approves award of contracts to First Specialty Insurance, Illinois
Union Insurance, and Allied World Assurance Company for the Private Manager Insurance
Program’s General Liability, Umbrella Liability, Excess Liability Insurance Coverages, for an
aggregate total amount of premiums of $1,203,832. The Property Manager’s Insurance Program,
known as PMIP, is a CHA controlled insurance program that ensures that the Authority has the
necessary insurance protection for general liabilities associated with the management of its
housing portfolio. This program provides the most cost effective insurance solution for the
portfolio, while maintaining coverage standards that are difficult for property management firms
to procure individually. All costs associated with the program (i.e. insurance premiums, claim
and broker administration fees), are deducted from the participating Private Property
Management Firm’s operating budgets. MBE/WBE/DBE participation has been waived, as
currently there are no MBE/WBE/DBE insurance companies that can meet CHA’s standard
criteria. Insurance providers must possess assets in excess of $1 billion and carry a minimum
rating of “A” by the A.M. Best Rating Guide; this is equivalent to an excellent credit rating for
an insurer. The above listed insurers meet this requirement.
RESOLUTION NO. 2013-CHA-13
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed Board Letter dated March 13, 2013,
entitled “Authorization to enter into contracts with First Specialty Insurance,
Illinois Union, and Allied World Assurance Company, for the Private Managers
Insurance Program’s General Liability, Excess Liability, and Umbrella Liability
Insurance Coverages”;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to enter into contracts for the Private Managers Insurance Program,
through Aon Risk Services, Inc., with: (1) First Specialty Insurance (General
Liability) in the amount of $541,828; (2) Illinois Union (Umbrella Liability) in
the amount of $475,524; and (3) Allied World Assurance Company (Excess
Liability) in the amount of $186,480 (amounts include premiums and surplus lines
taxes), for an aggregate total amount of $1,203,832 for the period April 1, 2013
through March 31, 2014.

(Item No. B2)
The resolution for Item B2 approves award of contract to Verizon Wireless, not-to-exceed
$636,454, to update CHA’s mobile services. In July 2012, a Request for Proposal was released
with requirements to enhance mobile services, equipment and vehicle tracking services for the
CHA. The solicitation was advertised in area newspapers and on CHA’s website. Of the three
proposals received, Verizon Wireless was deemed to be the most responsive and responsible
vendor. With the Smart Phones and USB devices provided by Verizon Wireless, CHA will
experience monthly cost savings; enhanced email functionality and access; faster internet
connection speed; 24/7 online account managing and a dedicated account team. The vehicle
tracking system will enable the CHA to incorporate updated technology with its mobile services
and equipment coupled with a new web fleet management system and enhanced online account
management services.

 RESOLUTION NO. 2013-CHA-14
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated March 13,
2013, entitled “AUTHORIZATION TO ENTER INTO CONTRACT WITH
VERIZON WIRELESS TO PROVIDE MOBILE SERVICES AND
EQUIPMENT”.
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners (“Board”) authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or
his designee to enter into a three (3) year contract with Verizon Wireless to
provide Mobile Services and Equipment in an amount not-to-exceed $636,454 for
the three year term.
This award is subject to the Contractor’s compliance with the CHA’s applicable
MBE/WBE/DBE, Section 3 resident hiring, and bonding and insurance
requirements.

(Item No. B3)
The CHA’s current natural gas supply and delivery contract with Integrys Energy Services will
expire on March 31st 2013. CHA manages approximately 21,000 lower-income public housing
units located throughout the City of Chicago. Providing heat and domestic hot water to these
units requires a consistent and reliable supply of large volumes of natural gas. Given the CHA’s
anticipated consumption of approximately 22,689,860 therms of natural gas for the next twentyfour (24) months, the recommended agreement offers CHA the opportunity to more
advantageously purchase its gas needs on wholesale terms instead of retail, and enables the CHA
to hedge against potential market price fluctuations through use of multi-tiered price/risk
management options available to the CHA as a wholesale (wellhead) purchaser. The CHA has
utilized wellhead purchasing practices to secure its natural gas supplies for the housing portfolio
at advantageous rates and to manage the risks of market fluctuations in natural gas costs and
supplies. Continued use of wellhead purchasing is expected to provide further cost savings and
efficiencies over the use of retail gas supplies from the local utility. Accordingly, the resolution
for Item B3 approves award of contract to Constellation New Energy for the supply and delivery
of natural gas to various CHA residential sites.
RESOLUTION NO. 2013-CHA-15
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed Board Letter dated March 13, 2013,
requesting “AUTHORIZATION TO ENTER INTO A CONTRACT WITH
CONSTELLATION NEWENERGY FOR THE SUPPLY AND DELIVERY OF
NATURAL GAS TO VARIOUS CHA RESIDENTIAL SITES”
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to enter into a contract with Constellation NewEnergy – Gas Division,
LLC for the supply and delivery of natural gas to various CHA residential sites
for a two (2) year base term in an amount not-to-exceed $11,800,000.00 for the
base term beginning April 1, 2013, with three (3) one–year extension options.
These awards are subject to the Contractor’s compliance with the CHA’s
8

 applicable MBE/WBE/DBE,
requirements.

(Item No. B4)
The resolution for Item B4 approves the first one-year option with Summer Advantage for the
Learn and Earn Summer Youth Program. The Learn and Earn program provides an academic
enrichment and career development summer program for approximately 700 CHA youth
between the ages of 13-15. The Learn and Earn program takes place at City Colleges of Chicago
campuses, Chicago State University and other sites throughout the city. The program will be in
session Monday to Friday from July 8, 2013 through August 16, 2013. Learn and Earn was
piloted in 2008 and due to its success, the program was increased to the current 700 slots in
2010. The Learn and Earn program addresses learning loss that often occurs during the summer
months. 2012 outcomes show that the majority of Summer Advantage’s Learn and Earn
participants experienced no learning loss during the program. On average, their participants
achieved slight gains in reading and math levels, as demonstrated by pre and post testing. CHA
collaborates closely with the City and partner agencies in planning youth programs and tracking
youth outcomes. In 2013, the Learn and Earn program will support the Mayor’s new Summer of
Learning initiative and the City’s One Summer Chicago program. Summer Advantage will be
responsible for staffing, managing and implementing the approved curriculum at each Learn and
Earn site where youth will be attending for six (6) hours per day, five (5) days a week, for a total
of 30 hours per week. During the program, youth will participate in a morning academic
enrichment session based on the provided curriculum that focuses on reading and math
proficiency. In the afternoon session, youth will participate in career development that includes
industry and career awareness, exploration and preparation activities. Youth will receive a
stipend of up to $600 based on attendance and participation.
RESOLUTION NO. 2013-CHA-16
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated March 13,
2013, entitled “AUTHORIZATION TO EXERCISE THE FIRST ONE YEAR
OPTION WITH SUMMER ADVANTAGE FOR THE LEARN AND EARN
SUMMER YOUTH PROGRAM”;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his designee
to exercise the exercise the first one-year option of Contract 11105 Entrepreneurial
Ventures in Education, Inc. d/b/a Summer Advantage in an amount not-to-exceed
$1,699,442 to provide the Learn and Earn summer youth program for CHA youth
ages 13-15.
This award is subject to the Contractor’s compliance with the CHA’s
MBE/WBE/DBE, Section 3 and insurance requirements.

(Item No. B5)
The resolution for item B5 approves award of contract to Growing Power, Inc. to provide a
Youth Development Program in Urban Agriculture. CHA’s Resident Services Division is
charged with engaging youth in out-of-school time and summer activities to support their
development. Among these programs are initiatives that provide employment and training
9

 programs for youth. One of these initiatives, launched in 2010, was the installation of an urban
farm within the Altgeld Gardens community. Since inception, the farm has supported
employment and training programs for more than 400 youth and adults, providing valuable skills
training while increasing the community’s access to healthy food. The proposed program will
provide a year round youth program, serving a minimum of 150 youth per year (300 over the
two-year base term) from the Altgeld Gardens community. The primary components of the
program will include, but not be limited to: employment skills development, farm work, life
skills development, culinary and nutrition education and community building and engagement.
Growing Power is a national nonprofit organization that focuses on supporting people of diverse
backgrounds and environments by providing access to healthy, high-quality, safe and affordable
food for people in the community. This mission is implemented through on-the-ground, handson training of youth and adults to take ownership of the garden and engage the community to do
the same. Growing Power’s youth employment training programs educate youth on sustainable
urban agriculture while providing transferrable employment and life skills.
RESOLUTION NO. 2013-CHA-17
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated March 13,
2013, entitled “AUTHORIZATION TO ENTER INTO A CONTRACT WITH
GROWING POWER, INC. TO PROVIDE A YOUTH DEVELOPMENT
PROGRAM IN URBAN AGRICULTURE”;

THAT

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his designee
to enter into a contract with Growing Power, Inc. to provide a youth development
program in urban agriculture in an amount not-to-exceed $349,597 for a two-year
base period, with two (2) additional one-year options.
This award is subject to the Contractor’s compliance with the CHA’s
MBE/WBE/DBE, Section 3 and insurance requirements.

(Item No. B6)
Since 2005, CHA and City Colleges of Chicago (CCC) have partnered to provide education and
training programs for CHA residents and families living in the private market with a Housing
Choice Voucher (HCV). In addition to existing CCC degree and certification programs, CHA
and CCC have collaborated to develop specialized training programs (e.g. GED and Healthcare
Bridge) that have enabled residents needing more extensive educational support to move towards
entry into degree and certification programs or directly to employment. The resolution for Item
B6 approves an Intergovernmental Agreement with the City Colleges of Chicago. In 2013, the
IGA will continue to provide for the delivery of educational services for CHA and HCV families
at a variety of educational levels, as well as provide support while residents are engaged in
educational activities. Additionally in 2013, CCC will continue to be an integral partner in
CHA’s summer youth program, Learn and Earn. Through the IGA, CHA is able to access the
summer food service program, as well as provide additional supervision and onsite coordination.
CHA leverages the IGA through use of CCC facilities, including all classroom space at CCC
campuses at no charge to CHA for the 400 youth participants. In 2013, CHA and CCC will
continue to collaborate on these existing initiatives and launch targeted marketing campaigns and
enhanced outreach to promote the education opportunities and services available to all CHA
residents.

MTW Agreement between itself and HUD, which supersedes the original MTW Agreement and
11

commitments made in the original Plan for Transformation and each Annual Plan. HUD requires
this report to be submitted annually, along with a Board of Commissioners’ resolution approving
this report, no later than 90 days after the end of CHA’s fiscal year. The FY2012 MTW Annual

2013 Operations Committee meeting, but pulled, at the request of staff, from the Board agenda.
(Item C3)
The resolution for Item C3 approves an Agreement to enter into a Housing Assistance Payments
Contract for Hope Manor II. Hope Manor II Apartments is the new construction of 73 units on
vacant City-owned land at 6002 S. Halsted in the Englewood community. The City will convey
the land to Volunteers of America (VOA) at closing. The development will be supportive
housing for homeless and disabled Veterans including families with children and individuals.
VOA has been a national leader in providing services to Veterans for over 30 years and currently
serves more than 7,500 Veterans daily in more than 50 Veteran specific programs throughout the
country. Construction is expected to begin in April, 2013 and be ready for occupancy in
October, 2014. It is the intent of the manager of this property to lease all of the units to eligible
persons from CHA’s waiting lists. Eligibility for the property includes being a Veteran, or
having a family member who is a Veteran, and is interested in receiving supportive services. To
accomplish this CHA will utilize a cross-referenced list of Central Referral System (CRS)
applicants and CHA applicants who have identified themselves as Veterans. CHA will also
make referrals from its Public Housing and HCV waiting lists as well as families whose right of
return under the Relocation Rights Contract has not been satisfied who have identified
themselves or a family member as having served in the military. The CHA waiting list of

(Item C6)
The CHA issued an Invitation For Bid in December 2012 for Life Safety and ADA upgrades at
the Las Americas Apartments. Of the four bids received, Oakley Construction Co., Inc.
submitted the lowest responsive and responsible bid. Accordingly, the resolution for Item C6
approves award of contract to Oakley Construction, Co., in the amount of $1,747,080. The
scope of this contract includes installation of emergency generator and Auto Transfer Switches;
installation of smoke and CO detectors as required; fire alarm system including speakers and
14

 strobes, a new fire pump and installation of a fire sprinkler system for all areas of the building
with sprinkler heads. These activities will enhance accessibility at building entrances and
common areas, upgrade existing life safety features, and add new life safety equipment, such as a
complete fire alarm system, extend the useful life of the building, increase the value of the
property, and improve the overall quality of the development. Other building improvements
include security camera installation on lobbies and hallways, common area modifications to
comply with ADA code requirements, and replacement of the existing emergency generator.
Fire Life Safety upgrades are recommended in order to provide systems that are compliant with
the City of Chicago’s recently enacted Life Safety and High Rise Ordinance, and the Chicago
Building Code. This Ordinance requires improvements to this and other buildings by the end of
2014. The designs include elements which will achieve this goal.

 (Item C7)
The CHA advertised a Request For Proposal in November 2012 for the supply and delivery of
various appliances for the CHA. It is the CHA's intent to establish a new requirements contract
for the purpose of purchasing appliances from a qualified manufacturer. This will benefit the
CHA by: the standardization of appliances throughout the CHA; ability to lock in initial unit
prices, subject only to adjustments for increases in refrigerator prices due to periodic Federal
EnergyStar™ regulation changes, having the flexibility to purchase a variety of appliances at a
cost savings, and allowing all CHA departments to use this contract to procure appliances as
needed. Of the three bids received, one vendor was deemed non-responsive. General Electric
(GE) Company was the lowest responsive vendor and the highest evaluated responsive
respondent. Accordingly, the resolution for Item C7 approves award of contract to GE in the
amount of $2,500,000. The CHA is required by HUD regulations to ensure appliances, comply
with U.S. Department of Energy guidelines, and be EnergyStar™ rated. Additionally, select
appliances will be designated with the ADA/504 compliant certification to serve CHA residents,
as needed. GE will deliver appliances ordered by CHA on a “just in time” basis. GE will provide
an internet based platform for ordering, tracking and delivery of the appliances and will also
provide a maintenance training program to CHA.
Per Commissioner Harris, Item C7 was tabled at the March 13th Committee Meeting so that staff
could provide additional information on recommended vendor’s M/W/DBE commitments
company-wide. Commissioners held discussions with staff, and on behalf of the Operations and
Committee, Commissioner Harris presented a Motion for the approval of the following
resolution:
RESOLUTION NO. 2013-CHA-24
