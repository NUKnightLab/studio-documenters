EXPLANATION

Bac und:

The former Stateway Gardens was one of largest developments and contained 1,644
units in eight gallery high rise buildings along the South State Street corridor. Many years of
neglect, high crime, extreme poverty, and isolation caused to demolish all 1,644
units to make way for a new on-site mixed-income community now known as Park Boulevard.
It encompasses approximately 34 acres of land generally bounded by 35th Street (north), State
Street (east), 39th Street (south) and Chicago Rock Island and Paci?c Railroad (west), all
within Chicago?s Douglas Community.

The Master Redevelopment Plan for Stateway Gardens (?Master Plan?) is being implemented
in 3 distinct phases that includes both on and off-site development. This new mixed-income

community brings together public housing families, affordable and market rate renters,
affordable and market rate homeowners, along with retail businesses and open space parks.
This Master Plan won the 2002 Charter Award from the Congress for New Urbanism and the
?rst phase won the 2007-2008 Community Vision Award (CVA) from a joint panel of ULI
Chicago, Home Builders Association of Greater Chicago.

In 2005, The Pershing, the ?rst off-site phase (1A) provided a total of 80 rental units; 27 CHA
and 53 affordable units. Park Boulevard Phase 1B, the ?rst on?site phase delivered a total of
159 diverse housing opportunities; 54 CHA and 105 affordable and market rate for-sale units.
It was designed by 7 different architects to create a traditional Chicago neighborhood and
provide diverse housing Opportunities for the different life styles.

In November 2008, the Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) competed for, won and was
awarded a $20,000,000 HOPE VI Grant to leverage and develop Park Boulevard?s Phase 2.

Phase 2 is currently being implemented in 4 sub-phases. In June 2011, the ?rst sub-phase
transaction known as 2A closed. Construction is well underway, on schedule and will be
completed this year. Phase 2A will provide 128 rental opportunities in a mix of 46 CHA, 53
affordable and 29 market rate rental units.

Park Boulevard IIB:
Phase IIB will provide 108 rental housing opporttmities situated both onsite and otfsite and
will continue the critical revitalization of both sides of State Street.

Integral components of this redevelopment phase include the on-site portion situated around
the existing Stateway Park and will enhance the planning efforts surrounding future public and
private development. The o?-site portion will replace blighted structures, add new retail
commerce and add signi?cant pedestrian traffic to the east and west sides of State Street,
making the site more appealing to future retailers.

The 108 rental units will consist of 37 CHA units (2-four bedroom, 9-three bedroom, l2-two
bedroom and 14-one bedroom units), 34 affordable and 37 market units. They will be housed
in four different structures; 2 Twelve unit 3-story buildings, 1 Seventy-two unit 6-story
building and 1 Twelve unit 3-story building with ground ?oor rental located on the east side of
State St. The offsite parcel located at the southeast comer of 36'h St and State Street was
acquired by the City, on behalf of CHA, per a Intergovernmental Agreement and
will be conveyed to CHA as part of the transaction. The three structures developed onsite will
wrap and form the northwest edge looking onto Stateway Park.

All buildings are designed to achieve a Chicago Green Homes Rating of three stars. The
project will include sustainable design strategies in all of the following categories; Sustainable
Site, Energy Ef?ciency, Materials, Health and Safety, Resource Conservation and Homeowner
Education.
