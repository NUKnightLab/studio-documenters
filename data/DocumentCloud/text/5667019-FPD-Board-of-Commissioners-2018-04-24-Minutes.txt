Summary: The Forest Preserve District of Cook County (the “Forest Preserves”) is requesting
authorization for the General Superintendent or a designee to have discretionary spending up to
$150,000.00 through the remainder of 2018 for advertising and promotional services with a variety of
media vendors to promote and showcase the amenities, programs and natural areas of the Forest
Preserves. The media vendors would be engaged for periods less than one year. The advertising and
promotional spending packages would be suggested by the Forest Preserves’ Communications Division

as other short and long-term goals of the Forest Preserves.
