Open Forum
Chairperson Tasha L. Cowan opened the meeting for public discussion:
City of Detroit Retiree Phillip Kendrick addressed the Board regarding the following:
�

Pension and EDRO calculation error
o Consensus: The Board of Trustees directed Administration staff to
look further into this issue.

EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR’S REPORT
Executive Director, Cynthia A. Thomas had no formal report this week but addressed
the following:
�
�
�

Legal Opinion from Attorney Robert Klausner regarding fiduciary responsibility.
Chairperson Cowan has appointed Trustee Kimberly Hall-Wagner to substitute
for Trustee Gail Oxendine on the Joint Personnel Committee.
Update on the requested Budget versus Actual quarterly report

Chairperson Cowan expressed her opinion that an independent opinion rendered
by Mr. Klausner should be taken into consideration. However, based on some of
the facts presented, she believed that the application process has been
compromised and she doesn’t approve of it.
Ms. Thomas explained that both Systems have engaged Mr. Klausner to serve as
independent legal counsel based on his public pension plan expertise since 2009.
Mr. Klausner has assisted the Systems with various matters pertaining to ethics
and fiduciary responsibility as well as providing counsel during the bankruptcy.
He is familiar with the plan design, the trustees, the administration and dynamics
of both Systems. Her decision to use him to quickly obtain an opinion on a
recruitment issue that had already begun was in her opinion, a prudent use of
resources.
