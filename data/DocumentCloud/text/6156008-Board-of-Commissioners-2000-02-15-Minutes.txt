requesting authorization for Office of the Chief Judge, Circuit Court of Cook County to issue a Request

evaluate the delivery of clinical information developed for abuse/neglect and delinquency cases. The

children and their families. Currently both adult juvenile clinical services are provided by a single
consolidated department, Forensic Clinical Services.
The qualified vendor will be requested to provide clinical services as ordered by the court, including
clinical evaluations, assessments, and consultations; to provide court testimony relating to clinical
information; and to establish and maintain a management information system for the compilation of clinic
data and statistics.
The nature of these professional services, are such that they lend themselves to a Request for Proposal
process. The RFP will be managed in a manner to ensure that the needs and best interests of the court and
Cook County are met. For your information and consideration, a copy of the report of The Clinical
Evaluation and Services Initiative and a preliminary draft of the RFP have been submitted. The RFP was

* Referred to the Committee on Finance October 19, 1999
Chairman Daley announced that the ordinance was re-distributed today because two pages were missing
when it was originally distributed. Chairman Daley also identified that the responses from the Purchasing
Agent to Commissioner Hansen's questions relative to the proposed ordinance was re-distributed on
February 7, 2000.
Commissioner Hansen asked Patrick McFadden, County Purchasing Agent, for a brief overview of the
proposed ordinance amendment.
Mr. McFadden reviewed the contracts for the last twelve months in order to make a determination of the
fiscal impact. It was determined that often the recycled product is less of an expense than a non-recycled
product. The substantive impact was on recycled paper, carpeting and paper manufactured without using
chlorine. The carpeting amounted to an additional expense of $100,000.00, although the carpeting itself
was substantive at $1.4 million worth of carpeting. The paper reflected an additional $26,000.00 on top
of a spread of $63,000.00 over and above the non-recycled paper. The additional expense for chlorinefree paper was $23,000.00 on top of the $63,000.00 totaling $86,000.00. The net effect of the ordinance
is $126,000.00, mostly in carpet and recycled paper manufactured without chlorine.

755

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 15, 2000
Commissioner Hansen stated this expenditure is certainly warranted, especially with respect to chlorinefree paper. Commissioner Hansen asked to be added as a co-sponsor of this Ordinance. He asked how
does the County handle the recycling of the refuse stream coming out of the County? He suggested a
comprehensive look at this refuse stream.
Commissioner Quigley thanked Chairman Daley because this item is an extension of an ordinance that
was previously passed and sponsored by Chairman Daley, which has brought the County to a 53% rate of
purchasing recycled paper. He thanked Mr. McFadden for his efforts in helping to craft the ordinance.
Commissioner Quigley indicated that there are representatives present from the Illinois Recycling
Coalition and Illinois Recycling Association who are in full support of the ordinance. He noted that the
National Association of Counties' (NACo) new initiative is "Counties purchasing recycled content." The
County is purchasing recycled content for cost savings, environmental purposes, and job creation. This
ordinance, Commissioner Quigley stated, will create incentives for new markets. He further stated that
seven land-fills in the area will be closing within the next year, and as a result environmental costs and
financial costs will increase. The Commissioner indicated the fastest growing part of a municipality's
budget is waste disposal. He stated there is a 25-50% cost reduction if recycling items are taken out of
the waste stream.
Commissioner Sutker stated this is a positive step forward. He indicated there has been a recycling effort
on a regular basis in the Village of Skokie for over a decade and it is cost-efficient, useful and serves the
community well. He continued by stating the landfill problem is continuing and that 20% of landfill
capacity will be closing by the end of year 2000.

Commissioner Quigley, seconded by Commissioner Hansen moved approval of Item No. 231594.
The motion carried.

Sufficient funds have been appropriated to cover this request.
The Capital Review Committee concurs with this recommendation.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 15, 2000
Commissioner Sims asked Betty Perry if Ameritech has met the MBE/WBE requirements?
Ms. Perry responded that Ameritech has not met the requirements. She indicated that Contract
Compliance is waiting for information from the vendor and she noted that the contract will not be
executed until all requirements are met. Ms. Perry concluded that the information should be received
before the next board meeting.
Alexis Herrera, from the Sheriffs Office, stated that the vendor supplied the Contract Compliance Office
with documentation from I 997 and 1998. Once the vendor completes their year-end books for 1999, they
will fully comply with the MBE/WBE requirements.
Chairman Daley asked Ms. Perry, if before this contract is approved by the Board, will the MBE/WBE
requirements be met?
Ms. Perry responded in the affirmative.
Commissioner Maldonado asked ifthe contract will come back to the full board before it is executed.
Chairman Daley replied yes.
Commissioner Collins asked what does this equipment do? She also asked if the equipment sends off

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 15, 2000

COOK COUNTY TREASURER, by Michael J. Shine, Chief Deputy Treasurer, transmitting
a Communication, dated January 10, 2000:
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to renew Contract No. 99-41-519 with
LASALLE NATIONAL BANK, Chicago, Illinois, to provide lock box services for the first
and second real estate tax installments of fiscal year 2000.
The office has completed a Request for Proposal (RFP) bid process for the lock box services
for fiscal year 2000. The office solicited responses from fifty (50) banking institutions
resulting in twelve (12) responses. Of the twelve (12) responses eleven (11) vendors declined
via a letter and one (1) vendor was responsive to the RFP. In general, banks declining
submission of a proposal noted the three (3) following reasons:
1.
2.
3.

Lack of a branch network to provide payment centers.
Lack of an ability to process the volume of payments or to provide specialized services.
Lack of an ability to implement payment processing requirements.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $360,000.00. Costs will be offset through an interest bearing
account. Contract period: February 1, 2000 through January 31, 2001. (060 249 Aeeount).

* Referred to the Committee on Finance on February 2, 2000
Chairman Daley announced that additional backup material had been distributed for Item 233735 from
·
the Treasurer's Office.
Commissioner Sutker stated the lock box effort has been a success and that this pilot program should be
continued in the future. He asked Tim Dauber, Finance Manager of the Treasurer's Office, ifthere have
been studies of other counties, such as Lake County, with respect to federally insured banks being sites
for any taxpayers to make real estate tax payments.
Mr. Dauber referred the question to Jim Allen, representative of the Treasurer's Office.
Mr. Allen answered there has been research and there are major problems. He noted that the most
significant problem under the Lake County system is the banks do not have to tender the receipts that they
receive from the taxpayers for up to 10 days. As a result, the banks receive potentially 10 days interest on
those property taxes. Conservatively, if the interest rate was 5% the County would potentially be ceding
$I 0 million in interest earnings.
Commissioner Sutker asked if Cook County is bound to a 10 day period with LaSalle National Bank?
Mr. Allen responded no, Cook County is not bound to a ten day period.
Commissioner Sutker asked how LaSalle National Bank pays interest?
Mr. Allen answered the interest is required to be credited into an interest bearing account.
Commissioner Sutker stated that LaSalle National Bank is earning interest on the County's interest as
well. Commissioner Sutker asked what other major problems exist.
Mr. Allen stated that there is a problem in the document provisions. Currently, in Lake County the banks
involved do not provide any copy of the front of the taxpayer's check. Lake County has run into
problems where there are duplicate payments. Mr. Allen received information from Lake County
Treasurer, Robert Skidmore, regarding problems with the banks in Lake County not being equipped to do
imaging. Mr. Allen proceeded to state that Cook County does receive the front image and corresponding
image of the PIN number to which payment was applied to, to help detect error or settle any dispute.

758

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 15, 2000
Commissioner Sutker stated that this is different than what he has heard and asked for something in
writing from Lake County referencing what Mr. Allen expressed. He asked what are the other problems?
Mr. Allen remarked in Lake County there are 200,000 PIN numbers and approximately 50 participating
banks, while in Cook County there are 1.5 million PIN numbers and 191 banks. He noted there are
collateralization issues, where community banks are required to have certain levels of collateral in order
to be taking in this money. The banks must show in excess of 100%.
Mr. Allen expressed that the lock box is an important first step in enhancing investment performance and
customer service. He indicated that RFPs were sent to 50 banks and 12 responses were received and 11
banks declined to participate in this venture.
Commissioner Sutker asked why 11 banks declined to participate?
Mr. Allen stated that the responses can be provided to the commissioners. For example, he expressed
that some banks were not ready, did not have the ability to handle such transactions or were transferring
technology and equipment at this time.
Commissioner Sutker was disturbed with the County Treasurer's Office brochure listing LaSalle National
Bank locations on the back. He stated there must be a way that the County can provide a service
conveniently to the county's taxpayers which would include all federally insured banks that are equipped
and willing to participate in this program. The Treasurer's goal should be to include more federally
insured banks.
Mr. Allen stated that the Treasurer's goal is to include all banks for more convenience and has even been
exploring currency exchanges, in the communities that have no community banks. A long term goal is to
allow taxpayers to pay on the internet. The Treasurer's Office wants to provide as many different options
as possible for the taxpayer.
Commissioner Sutker asked what is the interest that the County receives from LaSalle Bank on the
amount of money that is kept in the lockboxes during the period of time they retain the sums?
Mr. Allen commented that LaSalle National Bank was a key component in increasing interest earnings.
Peter Karahalios, Legal Counsel/First Deputy Treasurer, Treasurer's Office, stated that the way the
accounts are structured is that the money goes from LaSalle Bank into a concentration account. The
concentration account is swept into a Repo Account, earning 200 basis points more than the NOW
account. The rate ofreturn is approximately 5.2 to 5.3%.
Commissioner Sutker stated that LaSalle Bank acquires its profit from that amount above 5.2% which it
can generate using those dollars for investment.
Mr. Karahalios stated LaSalle Bank is making the amount that they are able to charge the County given
the number of PIN numbers that go through the lock box.
Commissioner Sutker stated the County should find a way to use this program as a spring board to a more
generic program to expand services. This program will let the banks compete with each other, with
respect to the services they provide to their customers. The Treasurer's brochure sends the wrong
message to the public, banks and taxpayers. The County should not look like it is favoring LaSalle
National Banks.

759

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 15, 2000
Commissioner Lechowicz stated there was a memorandum distributed from Chairman Daley's Office, to
the Commissioners. The memorandum originated from Treasurer Pappas and Grace Colbe1t of the
Budget Department as a correction on the Estimated Fiscal Impact for this item.
Commissioner Lechowicz, seconded by Commissioner Sutker, moved to amend the Estimated Fiscal
Impact with respect to Item 233735, as follows: $360,000.00 $0.00. (Costs of this service is estimated at
$360,000.00 and will be offset through compensating balances through an interest bearing account).
Contract period: February 1, 2000 through January 31, 2001. (060 249 Aeeo1:10t).
Commissioner Hansen asked how the $500,000.00 and $360,000.00 figures relate on Item 233735?
Mr. Dauber responded that the $500,000.00 was put together for the budget. It was only an estimate;
what is needed is to complete the second installment transactions from the lockboxes to get a more
accurate number, to base the figures for year 2000. The way that this will be paid is $360,000.00, but it
will not be charged to an appropriation account. It will be charged to the "A Fund" Account.
Commissioner Hansen stated that the Treasurer's Office cannot obligate $360,000.00 to come from the A
Fund Account without the Board's approval. Ultimately, the County is paying this amount. He asked if it
can be zeroed-out?
Mr. Dauber indicated when the Treasurer's Office was going through the budgetary process, it requested
that $500,000.00 be placed in the Appropriations Account 249. The Treasurer's Office was directed not
to do so and it was in the best interest of the County to leave it the way it was, paid outside of the C Fund
Account. He stated that it is paid out of the A Fund Account. The reason why the item is on the agenda
before the Board is to inform the Commissioners that the Treasurer's Office will be handling it this way.
He noted the A Fund Account is not under the authority of the Board.
Commissioner Hansen asked if the State's Attorney's Office could address the Committee on this issue
regarding Item 233735.
Kathy Howlett, Assistant State's Attorney, responded that she would like to review this issue and will
respond in writing.
Commissioner Hansen voiced his concern, regarding whether the County is allowing a bank to charge
hidden fees.
Commissioner Lechowicz stated that the fiscal impact of this program is being shifted out of the taxing
portion of the budget to an interest bearing A Fund Account, and the Treasurer's Office is seeking the
Commissioner's approval.
Commissioner Hansen stated that 10% of all property tax revenue goes to Cook County and so 10% of
the cost goes to the County as well. He stated if there is a $360,000.00 charge to be levied through
receiving less money then this is a cost passed on by the Treasurer's Office. He asked what is the
statutory basis for this?
Mr. Dauber answered that the Treasurer's Office does not believe it has sole authority over this issue.
The Treasurer's Office did an RFP to comply with the Board's request. The A Fund Account does not
have an appropriation account for this to be charged to, however, there will be a cost incurred of
$360,000.00.

760

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 15, 2000
Commissioner Hansen expressed interest in all revenues generated by any and all funds in the Treasurer's
Office to the degree that those revenues are impacted by charges. He asked Tom Glaser, Chief Financial
Officer, to address the committee as to where does the $360,000.00 expenditure appear in the County's
Budget?
Chairman Daley noted for the members, that the Jetter requesting an amendment to Item 233735 is also
signed by the Director of the Department of Budget & Management Services, Grace Colbert.
Mr. Glaser stated $360,000.00 is a cost estimate based on the volume of transactions processed by
LaSalle National Bank. It is a compensating balance.
Commissioner Hansen asked what is the net figure? For example, if $720,000.00 is generated, the cost is
$360,000.00, the net revenue figure is $360,000.00. The request frqm the Treasurer's Office cannot
reflect a fiscal impact of zero.
Commissioner Lechowicz, seconded by Commissioner Silvestri, moved that the Chief Financial
Officer submit a report to the committee, as far as the status of the funds. Included in the report
should be what is involved in the funds and which are approved and not approved by the Board. If
the funds are not approved, there should be an ordinance prepared by the Chief Financial Officer,
requesting that all funds be approved by this Board for any type of expenditures. The motion
carried.

Commissioner Lechowicz commented that this would alleviate Commissioner Hansen's concern about
the A Fund possibly being spent without Board authorization.
Commissioner Steele indicated there are communities within Cook County where LaSalle Bank has no
presence. Commissioner Steele hopes that other financial institutions are added to accommodate all
citizens in the next fiscal year.
Commissioner Hansen stated that good government finance practices should show gross revenues arid
fees should be netted-out afterwards. Fees shown should be shown as they are paid by the Treasurer.
Commissioner Collins asked to look at all agencies that are not taxing bodies to ensure that no
departments have a fund that they can dip into at their discretion. She wants a report showing the source
of the funds to all departments.
Chairman Daley clarified that the request made by Commissioner Lechowicz will include all departments.
Commissioner Hansen stated concern of potential taxpayers suits by charging a fee on collecting receipts.
There needs to be statutory authority. If there is a charge of $360,000 to collect $7 billion, there has to be
adequate authority.
Chairman Daley commented that Assistant State's Attorney Howlett will guide the committee on
Commissioner Hansen's concern.
Commissioner Silvestri asked what is the A Fund Account income over the last year?
Mr. Dauber answered $14,100,000.00 in interest earnings for Fiscal Year 1999.

Commissioner Silvestri asked if the additional earnings were based on interest of deposits of tax
payments?

761

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 15, 2000
Mr. Dauber answered in the affirmative.
Commissioner Silvestri asked how much of the $14,100,000.00 earnings were spent?
Mr. Dauber answered that nothing was spent in Fiscal Year 1999. It was a budgetary item (060-249)
within the C Fund. The Treasurer's Office was directed to pay for this out of the interest income from the
A Fund Acc<?unt in the Fiscal Year 2000 Budget. The $14.1 million is a pass through. The $14.1 million
went to the taxing bodies and agencies.
Commissioner Silvestri commented that this item should not be used as an example. The committee has
seen items similar to this originating from other offices. Often times, a fiscal impact of zero means this is
being paid out of some other source, even though it may not have an impact on the budget.
Commissioner Goslin indicated that a fiscal impact of zero would be misleading. There should be a process
open to all banks and eliminate the perceived favored status of LaSalle Banks. He pointed out that his
district borders 3 different counties where other banks work with various systems. He noted that McHenry
County will be opening a cyber account next year and perhaps that should be another avenue to pursue.
Commissioner Quigley echoed Commissioners Sutker's and Goslin's comments, to expand the program
to include additional banks. He stated the Treasurer's original request to place this item in the budget was
a better approach.
Chairman Daley asked Grace Colbert, Director of the Department of Budget and Management Services,
to address the Finance Committee.
Commissioner Lechowicz referenced a letter, originating from Treasurer Pappas and Grace Colbert, as a
correction to the Estimated Fiscal Impact and inquired if Ms. Colbert agreed with the letter?
Ms. Colbert agreed there is a zero estimated fiscal impact. She commented the historical practice has
been to administer the lock box through a compensating balance arrangement. There has never been a
disbursement or cost related to it.
Commissioner Lechowicz asked how much money is in the different accounts and do they come before
the County Board for approval of any type of expenditure?
Ms. Colbert stated that she could not answer the question because she sees the budget only within the
context of the C Fund.
Commissioner Lechowicz commented that since this practice has been used in the past, does she have any
concerns regarding legal issues?
Ms. Colbert answered that a legal person should respond to that question, however, this is a historical
practice.
Commissioner Hansen asked if the cost for this service had ever been in the budget?
Ms. Colbert responded in the negative to Commissioner Hansen's question, there is no cost as far as the
budget is concerned.
Commissioner Hansen commented that there is a cost associated with this program, that this is not a
minimum balance situation. Commissioner Hansen asked if the Board has been informed of the
minimum balance requirements and what it entails? He further asked if Ms. Colbert has been informed of
the composition of the minimum balance.

762

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 15, 2000
Ms. Colbert responded that she did not know what the minimum balance requirements are and what
services are provided. This is outside the purview of the budget.
Commissioner Silvestri stated that this is a systematic problem. He said if the system needs reform, it
should be addressed as a whole.

..

Chairman Daley expressed caution in deferring Item 233735. He further stated that a precedent may be
set for all departments that present an item which reflects an estimated fiscal impact of zero. Moreover,
the Budget Director has not only concurred with this matter, she also signed off on it.
Mr. Allen stated deferring the item will delay the program and it will become costly in terms of lost
interest earnings. A delay will cause the County to return to pre-lock box days. Commissioner Hansen
suggested that Item 233735 be approved contingent upon receipt of the opinion from the State's
Attorney's Office.
Commissioner Carr, seconded by Commissioner Hansen, moved to defer consideration of Item
233735. Following discussion, Commissioners Carr and Hansen withdrew their motion.
Chairman Daley formally made the request to the State's Attorney's Office for a legal opinion with
respect to Item 233735.
Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Lechowicz, moved to approve Item 233735
contingent upon receipt of an opinion from the State's Attorney's Office. The motion carried.
Commissioner Hansen moved to adjourn the meeting, seconded by Commissioner Carr.
