PREPARED BY: A. PHILLIPS

SCOPE: ERECT A NEW BUILDING (PUBLIC HEARING)
EXISTING CONDITIONS
The building located at 445 Ledyard Street is a 2-story structure that was constructed in 1956 as the Mariners Inn. The
horizontal massing is clad in variegated light red/orange brick and features cast stone details. A single-story addition
was constructed in 1995 directly east (toward Cass Avenue) of the original structure. The addition is simple in design
and is clad in a red/orange brick similar to that of the original building and features buff-colored bands above and
below window openings and around the top of the parapet. The building is surrounded on the north, west, and east
sides with surface parking. A paved and fenced-in recreation area exists at the rear of the structure.

PROPOSAL
With the current proposal, the applicant is seeking the Commission’s approval to erect a new 3-6 story (stepped
massing) mixed-use building at the corner of Cass Avenue and Ledyard Street per the attached drawings.
Included in the proposal are the following scope items:
• Infill existing parking area and a portion of the recreation area with new building—no demolition of existing
structures is proposed
• Construct new 3-6 story mixed-use building
o 3 and 4 stories along Ledyard Street to include main building entrance at street level and offices and
residential above
o 6 stories along Cass Avenue to include retail and landscaping at street-level and residential above
o Roof gardens, recycling, open space, bike racks,, basketball court and outdoor furniture to be
included
• Construct new surface parking lot at the south side of the parcel, behind the new structure, and outside of the
Cass Park Historic District
STAFF OBSERVATIONS & RESEARCH
• The Little Caesars Arena parking garage is located across Cass Avenue, directly east of the project site.
ISSUES
• While the red brick proposed for the Ledyard Street massing is taking the adjacent buildings into

 consideration, it is staff’s opinion that a contrasting brick color such as dark grey would honor the
surrounding context while differentiating the new building from the old. Additionally, it would bring a
sense of material and palette cohesion to the proposed new construction.
RECOMMENDATION
It is staff’s opinion that the work, as proposed, does not destroy historic materials that characterize the historic
building, its site, and setting. Staff therefore recommends that the Commission find the scope items listed above to be
appropriate as they meet the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation
9) New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials that
characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the
massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment.
However, staff recommends that the Commission issue this COA with the following condition:
• HDC Staff shall be afforded the opportunity to review and approve any minor revisions to the project's design
prior to the issuance of the permit. Should staff determine that such revisions are not consistent with the
intent of the Commission’s approval or do not meet the SOI Standards, staff shall forward the project to the
Commission for review at a regular Meeting.
ELEMENTS OF DESIGN
(1) Height. Heights within the district are varied, from 445 Ledyard, a two-story (2 story) building with a singlestory addition) to 500 Temple, a fourteen-story (14 story) building. Commercial, residential, and institutional
buildings all vary in height.
(2) Proportion of buildings front facades. Front façades of all building are typically than wide, with few
exceptions. A notable exception is the building at 2727 Second Avenue, which is four (4) stories tall but is
composed of three (3) distinct sections, two (2) of which are taller than wide. Buildings often occupy most or all
of deep lots, resulting in side elevations of buildings that are often substantially wider than tall.
(3) Proportion of openings within the facades. Openings generally amount to between twenty (20) percent and
thirty-five (35) percent of the front façade, typically of office or apartment buildings from the first half of the
twentieth (20th) century. Windows are taller than wide on all building types with the exception of Art Decoinfluenced buildings at 2906 Cass and 445 Ledyard. On apartment buildings, sash windows are sometimes
arranged in groupings which, together, are wider than tall. A minority of buildings feature arched, mullioned,
semicircular, casement, or dormer windows appropriate to their respective architectural styles. Upper sashes and
transoms are occasionally subdivided into smaller panes. Casement windows are usually subdivided into smaller
panes. Door openings are typically slightly larger in scale than window openings. Primary entrance openings are
usually centered on the façades of buildings.
(4) Rhythm of spacing of building on streets. Rhythm of spacing on streets is generally determined by setbacks
from side lot lines. The overall character of the district is one of densely clustered, yet visually distinct,
structures separate by narrow side setbacks, or sharing common walls. There is a general irregularity in the
widths of buildings, and in the widths of subdivisions lots themselves, subdivision lots from one block to
another, contributing to an irregular rhythm of spacing of building on streets.
(6) Rhythm of entrance and/or porch projections. Porches and entrances typically do not project. On apartment
buildings, entrances are often located several steps above grade to accommodate high basements. Doorways on
other buildings are typically centered on building façades. Irregular building widths creates an irregular rhythm
of entrance projections. Several entrances of the building at 500 Temple are raised above a high basement and
accessed by broad, projecting, limestone steps.
(7) Relationship of materials. Many building are faced with brick and feature stone or cast stone trim. Limestone
clads several buildings, including monumental structures at 2727 Second and 500 Temple. Wood is uncommon
other than as a sash window material, but wood brackets and eaves adorn the sole building on Charlotte. Metal
is used on decorative corbel panels on 2952 Second, for windows spandrels at 2966 Second, as a window frame
material on several buildings, and, notably, for the porcelain enamel steel panels at 2906 Cass. Stone is used for
window sills, belt courses, and strong courses on a majority of buildings within the district. Roofs within the
district are generally flat and not visible, but copper accents define building at 500 Temple and 2727 Second.
The stature of Robert Burns is bronze on a granite base.
(8) Relationship of textures. On a majority of buildings within the district, the major textural effect is that of brick

with mortar joints juxtaposed with cast stone or limestone trim. Patterned brickwork is used to create subtle
detail on apartment buildings, such as spandrels and rectangular panels. More pronounced textural interest often
exists on the upper stories of buildings, such as at the sole building on Charlotte. Where they exist, detailed
wooden vergeboards, gables, brackets, and dormers create considerable textural interest on all single-family
residential buildings in the district. Rough-cut stone with thick mortar joints creates considerable textural interest
on buildings where it exists, while other buildings feature smooth stone with thin mortar joints.
Relation of colors. Natural brick colors in shades of brown, red, and buff predominate on wall surfaces, while
natural stone colors in shades of gray, red , and brown also exists. Although most roofs are flat and therefore not
visible, roofs on 2727 Second and 500 Temple are accented by green copper. Wood architectural details are
frequently painted in subdued tones appropriate to the architectural style of the buildings, but nonetheless
contrast with brick or limestone facing. Apartment buildings are unpainted, with gray stone trim contrasting with
brown or buff brickwork. The original colors of any building, as determined by professional analysis, are always
acceptable for that building and may provide guidance for similar buildings.
Relationship of architectural details. Buildings in the district exemplify a broad range of architectural styles,
and their architectural details relate to their style. Smaller apartment buildings are Italian Renaissance Revival or
Georgian Revival. The building at 2931 Second is Craftsman style. The building at 500 Temple is Gothic
Revival in style. Other buildings are frequently Classical Revival. Buildings range are high style in appearance,
with the level of architectural detail varying from one building to the next.
Relationship of roof shapes. Most building have flat roof that cannot be seen from the ground. At 500 Temple,
projecting, doomed towers and a varying building height creates a dramatic roofline. The building at 2727
Second features a flat-decked Mansard roof. Flat-roofed apartment buildings often feature parapet walls which
add interest.
Walls of continuity. Setbacks of buildings tend to vary slightly from one to the next, but generally create a
wall or continuity on all streets in the district. Significantly, building in the district create a wall of continuity
surrounding Cass Park. Mature trees create a wall of continuity along the perimeter of Cass Park, and provide a
sense of enclosure within the park.
Relationship of significant landscape features and surface treatment. Street trees exist only where setbacks
allow. Alleys provide access to the rear of a majority of lots in the district. Trees, hedges and other landscaping
features are regularly spaced where they exist. Trees in the front yards of buildings vary in size, age, and species.
Most buildings are built up to or near the front lot line. Public sidewalks run alongside all streets in the district.
Curbs, while historically stone, have been replaced with concrete in a majority of the district. Public lighting is
generally of the modern, steel, pole-mounted variety.
Relationship of open space to structures. The primary relationship of open space to structures is that of the
green space of Cass Park surrounded by a continuous street wall on four sides. Front and side yards range from
shallow to nonexistent. Other than public rights-of-way, no other large areas of open space exist. However,
outside the district boundaries, vast open spaces exist where they have been created by building demolition;
sometimes these spaces serve as parking lots or are maintained as open lawns.
Scale of façades and façade elements. Building are moderate to large in scale relative to typical buildings from
the period in which they were constructed. Residential buildings range from small to large scale, with the hotel
building at 400 Temple being significantly larger than the others. The largest buildings in the district are the
institutional buildings at 2727 Cass, which is four (4) stories tall and a full block wide, and 500 Temple, a
portion of which is fourteen (14) stories tall. Façade elements are moderate in scale, typical of building from the
time period.
Directional expression of front elevations. Façades of apartment structures are generally vertical in directional
expression due to tall window and door openings and relatively tall buildings heights. The building at 500
Temple has a strong directional expression. The buildings at 2727 Second has a vertical emphasis despite being
much wider than tall. Exceptions are Art Deco-influenced buildings at 2906 Cass and 445 Ledyard, which have
a horizontal emphasis.
Rhythm of building setbacks. While setbacks may vary slightly from one building to the next the overall
impression is one of a consistent rhythm of building setbacks. This rhythm is particularly significant where
structures create a street wall effect surrounding Cass Park.
Relationship of lot coverages. Lot coverages within the district are generally high. Buildings typically cover
most of their lots save small front or sides setbacks. Exceptions are smaller residential buildings at 2753 Park
and 457 Ledyard, which have rear yards.
Degree of complexity within the façades. The façades within the district range from simple to complex,
depending on style. Overall, front façades tend to be simple in their massing and mostly regular in their

 fenestrations, though a variety of window and door shapes, materials, architectural elements, and details of
individual buildings increase the overall level of complexity of the district. A particularly complex façade,
however, is that of 500 Temple, with projecting towers, bays, arched door surrounds, and other features that add
complexity.
(20) Orientation, vistas, overviews. Building generally face the streets and are entered from the front façades by a
single or double doorway. The larger buildings within the district, such as at 500 Temple, 2727 Cass, and 400
Temple, constitute landmarks that are clearly visible from several blocks away, or in the case of 500 Temple,
from a great distance . Buildings flanking Cass Park create a sense of enclosure and contribute greatly to the
integrity of feeling and setting within the park. The statue of Robert Burns sits on the northern edge of Cass
Park, centered on its block face, and faces north along Second Avenue. Cass Park bisects Second Avenue and,
consequently, provides a vista that is visible from a great distance to the north.
(21) Symmetric or asymmetric appearance. The appearance of front faced in the district is, for the most part,
symmetrical. The building at 500 Temple is asymmetrical, but is composed of sections that are symmetrical.
Cass Park is highly symmetrical in nature, with eight (8) sidewalks converging on the center of the park from
each corner and from the center of each of its four (4) sides; this relationship is considered a significant feature
of the park.
(22) General environmental character. The general character of the district is that of a dense, mixed –use, urban
neighborhood of apartment, office, and institutional buildings, surrounding and complimenting the green space of
Cass Park.

REPORT
Historic District Commission
Project Review Request
Description of Existing Conditions
The parcel of the proposed project has three existing buildings (operated by Mariners Inn) that will remain.
The new building will be located at the corner of Cass Avenue and Ledyard Street. Currently a surface parking
lot exists that holds 36 parking spaces. The parking lot will be removed for the new building, and a new
surface parking lot will be located at the South side of the new mixed-use building, along Cass Avenue
(outside the Cass Park Historic District boundary line). Open space and landscape will be part of the new
design (please see attached drawings).
Description of Project
Mariners Inn, a human service agency that provides residential and outpatient substance abuse treatment,
counseling, housing, health services, and job placement, is in planning stages of proposed new state-of-theart facility at the corner of Cass Avenue and Ledyard Street on the current Mariners Inn campus.
Because of Mariners Inn’s location, we are presented with a unique opportunity to provide a continuum of
services, from emergency shelter to permanent supportive housing, all in close proximity to ensure successful
cost-effective treatment, case management, and aftercare for the people we serve. The new building will
contain one-bedroom permanent supportive housing apartments for men and women, recovery housing
units as well as programmatic space and staff offices. Plans also call for retail space along Cass Avenue.
Current structures on the site will remain.
Without a stable place to live and a support system to help them address underlying problems, most
homeless people shift from one emergency system to the next – from the streets to shelters, to public
hospitals, to psychiatric institutions, substance abuse treatment centers, and detox centers, and ultimately,
back to the streets – in an endless cycle. Stable housing is central to attaining treatment goals, however, an
inadequate supply of affordable housing is one of the most significant gaps in the substance abuse treatment
system. The extremely high cost of this cycle of homelessness, in human and economic terms, can be seen in
the lives of the men who come through the doors of Mariners Inn.
Supportive housing -permanent, affordable housing linked to health, substance abuse services, mental
health, employment, and other support services- is a proven, cost- effective way to end homelessness for
people who face complex challenges. By providing chronically homeless people with a way out of expensive
emergency public services and back into their own homes and communities, supportive housing not only
improves the lives of its residents but also generates significant public savings.

To the Members of the Historic District Commission:

Mariners Inn, a human service agency that provides residential and outpatient
substance abuse treatment, counseling, housing, health services, and job placement,
is in planning stages of proposed new state-of?the-art facility at the corner of Cass
Avenue and Ledyard Street on the current Mariners Inn campus.

Because of Mariners Inn?s location, we are presented with a unique opportunity to
provide a continuum of services, from emergency shelter to permanent supportive
housing, all in close proximity to ensure successful cost-effective treatment, case

one bedroom permanent supportive housing apartments for men and women,
recovery housing units as well as programmatic space and staff offices. Plans also
call for retail space along Cass Avenue. Current structures on the site will remain.

CASS PARK HISTORIC DISTRICT
ELEMENTS OF DESIGN
01 HEIGHT
Heights within the district are varied, from 445 Ledyard, a two-story (2 story) building with a singlestory addition) to 500 Temple, a fourteen-story (14 story) building. Commercial, residential, and
institutional buildings all vary in height.

DESIGN RESPONSE
Proposed height is six stories max (66’), with smaller volumes at three to four stories along the front
lot line at Ledyard Street. The proposed building is in the mid size range of building heights in the
Cass Park Historic District.

02 PROPORTION OF BUILDINGS FRONT FACADES
Proportion of buildings front facades. Front façades of all building are typically than wide, with few
exceptions. A notable exception is the building at 2727 Second Avenue, which is four (4) stories tall
but is composed of three (3) distinct sections, two (2) of which are taller than wide. Buildings often
occupy most or all of deep lots, resulting in side elevations of buildings that are often substantially
wider than tall.

Proposed development is wider than tall along Cass Ave.

07 RELATIONSHIP OF MATERIALS
Many building are faced with brick and feature stone or cast stone trim. Limestone clads several
buildings, including monumental structures at 2727 Second and 500 Temple. Wood is uncommon
other than as a sash window material, but wood brackets and eaves adorn the sole building on
Charlotte. Metal is used on decorative corbel panels on 2952 Second, for windows spandrels at 2966
Second, as a window frame material on several buildings, and, notably, for the porcelain enamel steel
panels at 2906 Cass. Stone is used for window sills, belt courses, and strong courses on a majority
of buildings within the district. Roofs within the district are generally flat and not visible, but copper
accents define building at 500 Temple and 2727 Second. The stature of Robert Burns is bronze on
a granite base.

Proposed primary materials are brick and fiber cement panels. Brick will be used along Ledyard Street
where existing brick buildings are located. Fiber cement panels will be used along Cass Avenue.

09 RELATION OF COLORS
Natural brick colors in shades of brown, red, and buff predominate on wall surfaces, while natural
stone colors in shades of gray, red , and brown also exists. Although most roofs are flat and therefore
not visible, roofs on 2727 Second and 500 Temple are accented by green copper. Wood architectural
details are frequently painted in subdued tones appropriate to the architectural style of the buildings,
but nonetheless contrast with brick or limestone facing. Apartment buildings are unpainted, with gray
stone trim contrasting with brown or buff brickwork. The original colors of any building, as determined
by professional analysis, are always acceptable for that building and may provide guidance for similar
buildings.

Red brick (similar to existing adjacent buildings) and off-white/chrome colored fiber cement panels
are proposed.

 REPORT

11 RELATIONSHIP OF ROOF SHAPES
Most building have flat roof that cannot be seen from the ground. At 500 Temple, projecting, doomed
towers and a varying building height creates a dramatic roofline. The building at 2727 Second features
a flat-decked Mansard roof. Flat-roofed apartment buildings often feature parapet walls which add
interest.

Roof will be flat, in line with the adjacent Mariners Inn buildings and most buildings within the Cass
Park Historic District.

12 WALLS OF CONTINUITY
Setbacks of buildings tend to vary slightly from one to the next, but generally create a wall or continuity
on all streets in the district. Significantly, building in the district create a wall of continuity surrounding
Cass Park. Mature trees create a wall of continuity along the perimeter of Cass Park, and provide a
sense of enclosure within the park.

The wall of continuity along Ledyard is currently not aligned as the three existing buildings step back
the further away they are from Cass Park. Our proposed building will continue the wall of continuity
by placing our building on what is now a surface parking lot.

14 RELATIONSHIP OF OPEN SPACE TO STRUCTURES
The primary relationship of open space to structures is that of the green space of Cass Park surrounded
by a continuous street wall on four sides. Front and side yards range from shallow to nonexistent.
Other than public rights-of-way, no other large areas of open space exist. However, outside the
district boundaries, vast open spaces exist where they have been created by building demolition;
sometimes these spaces serve as parking lots or are maintained as open lawns.

Proposed commercial storefronts along Cass Avenue provide a continuous narrow transition for
landscape and outdoor seating. More open space is provided in the interior of the lot.

16 DIRECTIONAL EXPRESSION OF FRONT ELEVATIONS
Façades of apartment structures are generally vertical in directional expression due to tall window
and door openings and relatively tall buildings heights. The building at 500 Temple has a strong
directional expression. The buildings at 2727 Second has a vertical emphasis despite being much
wider than tall. Exceptions are Art Deco-influenced buildings at 2906 Cass and 445 Ledyard, which
have a horizontal emphasis.

Proposed expression in the front elevation has a horizontal emphasis, similar to the adjacent Mariners
Inn building.

17 RHYTHM OF BUILDING SETBACKS
While setbacks may vary slightly from one building to the next 164 the overall impression is one of a
consistent rhythm of building setbacks. This rhythm is particularly significant where structures create
a street wall effect surrounding Cass Park.

Proposed front façade is located directly on the front lot line at Ledyard, with an angular entrance to
the building.

18 RELATIONSHIP OF LOT COVERAGES
Lot coverages within the district are generally high. Buildings typically cover most of their lots save
small front or sides setbacks. Exceptions are smaller residential buildings at 2753 Park and 457
Ledyard, which have rear yards.

Proposed ground floor building footprint occupies 19% of the lot, with the remaining occupied by
landscaped public space, surface parking, and existing buildings.

 REPORT

20 ORIENTATION, VISTAS, OVERVIEWS
Building generally face the streets and are entered from the front façades by a single or double
doorway. The larger buildings within the district, such as at 500 Temple, 2727 Cass, and 400 Temple,
constitute landmarks that are clearly visible from several blocks away, or in the case of 500 Temple,
from a great distance . Buildings flanking Cass Park create a sense of enclosure and contribute
greatly to the integrity of feeling and setting within the park. The statue of Robert Burns sits on the
northern edge of Cass Park, centered on its block face, and faces north along Second Avenue. Cass
Park bisects Second Avenue and, consequently, provides a vista that is visible from a great distance
to the north.

Proposed orientation runs South to North along Cass Avenue, affording views of Cass Park to the
West and downtown Detroit to the South. Main entrance will be located on Ledyard Street, the main
façade.

21 SYMMETRIC OR ASYMMETRIC APPEARANCE
The appearance of front faced in the district is, for the most part, symmetrical. The building at 500
Temple is asymmetrical, but is composed of sections that are symmetrical. Cass Park is highly
symmetrical in nature, with eight (8) sidewalks converging on the center of the park from each corner
and from the center of each of its four (4) sides; this relationship is considered a significant feature of
the park.

Proposed massing is asymmetrical, with taller massing in the south corner that steps down towards
the northwest, resulting in a balanced composition.

22 GENERAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHARACTER
The general character of the district is that of a dense, mixed –use, urban neighborhood of apartment,
office, and institutional buildings, surrounding and complimenting the green space of Cass Park.

Proposed design will be a dense, mixed-use development that will complement the existing historic
fabric of Cass Park. Through material intentionality and the height considerations, the building will be
a balanced composition between past and contemporary design.

RE: Mariner?s Inn Property Development Project at Cass/Ledyard

To the Members of the Historic District Commission:

On behalf of Midtown Detroit, Inc. (MDI), I would like to express my support for Mariners Inn?s proposed
construction project at the corner of Cass Avenue and Ledyard Street.

As a prominent nonprofit and business partner in the community this project is important to our
organization and the growth of the neighborhood specifically because:

I This project has apartments with rents that are affordable to my neighbors.

I The project will invigorate the neighborhood and provide additional housing diversity that
complements the eclectic make-up of the neighborhood.

I There are spaces for businesses that are currently missing from my neighborhood.

I The project will ensure that social services are still provided to area residents.

I Project construction will generate jobs, taxes and economic income.

I Off-street vehicle and bicycle parking will be available to commercial tenants, customers, and
guests.

I The project will activate the streetscape on Cass Avenue and Ledyard Street.

For these reasons, I am strongly in favor of this project. The combination of this new investment paired
with affordable housing and opportunity for local entrepreneurship is exciting and will benefit efforts to
create an inclusive community and economic growth in my neighborhood.

Sincerely,

RE: PROPOSED MARINERS INN DEVELOPMENT
Dear Members of the Detroit Historic District Commission:
As Chair of the Neighborhood Advisory Committee (NAC) for the arena district, and
involved partner in the community, I would like to express support for the proposed
Mariners Inn mixed-use development project at the corner of Cass Avenue and
Ledyard Street.
Leadership at Mariner’s Inn reached out and provided an in-depth presentation to me
last month, which I, in turn, discussed with committee members at our June meeting.
The project is important to the NAC because it will:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Activate frontages along Cass and Ledyard, which is currently a surface lot;
Ensure social services are accessible to area residents;
Generate jobs, taxes, and economic revenue;
Invigorate the neighborhood with housing diversity that will complement its
eclectic character;
Provide apartments with truly affordable rents for an important demographic of
the Detroit community;
Provide commercial ground floor spaces to local businesses along Cass
Avenue, which are sorely needed in the neighborhood; and
Provide off-street vehicle and bike parking for tenants, customers, and guests.

The prospect of density, new affordable housing, and opportunity for entrepreneurship
and small business is wonderful. For these reasons, committee members are very
excited about the development and the investment Mariners Inn is proposing.
We offer our full support for their project.
Respectfully Submitted,
Francis Grunow, Chair
Neighborhood Advisory Committee - Arena District
