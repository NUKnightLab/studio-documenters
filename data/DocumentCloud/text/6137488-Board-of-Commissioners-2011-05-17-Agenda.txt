relevant case law;

In the absence of M/WBE participation goals the County has witnessed a drastic decline
in M/WBE participation in its construction contract below the availability of such firms and thus would

(d)
Only expenditures to a MBE or WBE that is performing a Commercially Useful Function
shall be counted. To determine whether a MBE or WBE is performing a Commercially Useful Function,
the County will evaluate the amount of work subcontracted, industry practices, whether the amount the
MBE or WBE is to be paid under the contract is commensurate with the work it is actually performing
and other relevant factors. To perform a Commercially Useful Function, the MBE or WBE must be
responsible, with respect to materials and supplies used on the contract, for negotiating price, determining
quality and quantity, ordering the material, installing (where applicable) and paying for the material itself.
A MBE or WBE does not perform a Commercially Useful Function if its role is limited to that of an extra
participant in the contract through which funds are passed in order to obtain the appearance of MBE or
WBE participation. If a MBE or WBE subcontracts a greater portion of the work of a contract than would
be expected based on normal industry practice, it is presumed not to perform a Commercially Useful
Function. When a MBE or WBE is presumed not to be performing a Commercially Useful Function, the
Certified Firm may present evidence to rebut this presumption.
(e)
One hundred percent of the cost of the materials or supplies obtained from a MBE or
WBE Manufacturer or Regular Dealer shall be counted. One hundred percent of the fees or transportation
charges for the delivery of materials or supplies required on a job site shall be counted only if the
payment of such fees is a customary industry practice and are commensurate with fees customarily
charged for similar services.
(f)
If a firm ceases to be a certified Certified Firm during its performance on a contract, the
dollar value of work performed under a contract with that firm after it has ceased to be certified shall not
be counted.
(g)
In determining achievement of Project Specific Goals, the participation of a MBE or
WBE shall not be counted until that amount has been paid to the MBE or WBE.
Sec. 34-299.

Contract pre-award compliance procedures.

(a)
For all solicitations, the bidder/proposer shall submit a Utilization Plan detailing all
subcontractors from which the Contractor solicited bids or quotations, and if Project Specific Goals have
been established, its achievement of the Goals or its Good Faith Efforts to do so. The Utilization Plan
shall be due at the time the bid / proposal is due.
(b)
Any agreement between a Contractor and a MBE or WBE in which the Contractor
requires that the MBE or WBE not provide subcontracting quotations to other Contractors is prohibited.
(c)
Where the Contractor cannot achieve the Project Specific Goal(s), the CC Director will
determine whether the Contractor has made Good Faith Efforts to meet the Goal(s). In making this
determination, the CC Director will consider, at a minimum, the Contractor's efforts to:

ITEM #1 cont’d
(1)

Solicit through all reasonable and available means (e.g., attendance at pre-bid
meetings, advertising and written notices) the interest of all MBEs and WBEs
certified in the scopes of work of the contract. The Contractor shall provide
interested MBEs and WBEs with timely, adequate information about the plans,
specifications, and requirements of the contract to allow MBEs and WBEs to
respond to the solicitation. The Contractor must follow up initial solicitations
with interested MBEs and WBEs.

(2)

Select portions of the work to be performed by MBEs and WBEs in order to
increase the likelihood that the Project Specific Goals will be achieved. This
includes, where appropriate, breaking out contract work items into economically
feasible units to facilitate MBE and WBE participation, even when the
Contractor would otherwise prefer to perform these work items with its own
forces. It is the Contractor's responsibility to make a portion of the work available
to MBEs and WBEs and to select those portions of the work or material needs
consistent with the availability MBEs and WBEs to facilitate their participation.

(3)

Negotiate in good faith with interested MBEs and WBEs. Evidence of such
negotiation includes the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of MBEs and
WBEs that were contacted; a description of the information provided regarding
the plans and specifications for the work selected for subcontracting; and why
agreements could not be reached with MBEs and WBEs. The Contractor may not
reject MBEs and WBEs as being unqualified without sound reasons based on a
thorough investigation of their capabilities. That there may be some additional
costs involved in finding and using MBEs and WBEs is not in itself sufficient
reason for a Contractor's failure to meet the Project Specific Goals, as long as
such costs are reasonable. The ability or desire of a Contractor to perform the
work of a contract with its own organization does not relieve it of the
responsibility to make Good Faith Efforts on all subcontractable scopes of work
that could be subcontracted.

(4)

Make efforts to assist interested MBEs and WBEs in obtaining bonding, lines of
credit, or insurance as required by the County or the prime Contractor, where
appropriate.

(5)

Make efforts to assist interested MBEs and WBEs in obtaining necessary
equipment, supplies, materials, or related assistance or services, where
appropriate.

(6)

Use the services of the Office of Contract Compliance, available
minority/women community organizations, minority/women contractors' groups,
government sponsored minority/women business assistance offices and other
appropriate organizations to provide assistance in the recruitment and placement
of MBEs and WBEs.

ITEM #1 cont’d
(e)
In determining whether a Contractor has made Good Faith Efforts, the performance of
other Contractors in meeting the Project Specific Goals may be considered. For example, when the
apparent successful Contractor fails to meet the Project Specific Goals but others meet it, it may be
reasonably questioned whether, with additional reasonable efforts, the apparent successful Contractor
could have met the Project Specific Goals. Similarly, if the apparent successful Contractor fails to meet
the Project Specific Goals, but meets or exceeds the average MBE or WBE participation obtained by
other Contractors, this may be evidence that the apparent successful Contractor made Good Faith Efforts.
(f)
A signed letter of intent from each listed MBE or WBE, describing the work, materials,
equipment or services to be performed or provided by the MBE or WBE and the agreed upon dollar value
shall be due at the time of bid proposal or within three days after such submission.
(g)
The CC Director shall timely review the Utilization Plan before award, including the
scope of work and the letters of intent from MBEs and WBEs. The CC Director may request clarification
in writing of items listed in the Utilization Plan, provided such clarification shall not include the
opportunity to augment listed participation or Good Faith Efforts.
(h)
If the CC Director determines that the Utilization Plan demonstrates that the Project
Specific Goals have been achieved or Good Faith Efforts made, with the concurrence of the User
Department, the CC Director and User Department shall recommend award to Purchasing Agent
Department.
(i)
If the CC Director finds that a Contractor did not make sufficient Good Faith Efforts, the
CC Director shall communicate this finding to the User Purchasing Department and recommend that the
bid/proposal be rejected. A Contractor may protest this determination pursuant to the County's bid protest
procedures.
Sec. 34-300.

Contract administration procedures.

(a)
Upon award of a contract by the County that includes Project Specific Goals, the Project
Specific Goals become covenants of performance by the Contractors in favor of the County and
incorporated in the contract.
(b)
The Contractor shall provide a listing of all subcontractors to be used in the performance
of the contract, and detailed subcontractor information to the County with each request for payment
submitted to the County or as otherwise directed by the County. The CC Director and the User
Department shall monitor subcontractor participation during the course of the contract. The County shall
have full and timely access to the Contractor's books and records, including without limitation payroll
records, tax returns and records and books of account, to determine the Contractor's compliance with its
commitment to MBE and WBE participation and the status of any MBE or WBE performing any portion
of the contract. This provision shall be in addition to, and not a substitute for, any other provision
allowing inspection of the Contractor's records by any officer or official of the County for any purpose.

approves such substitution in writing. A Contractor shall not allow a substituted
subcontractor to begin work until both the Director, Purchasing Agent and the User
Department have approved the substitution.

(2)

The facts supporting the request must not have been known nor reasonably should have
been known by either party before the submission of the Utilization Plan. Bid shopping is
prohibited. The Contractor must negotiate with the MBE or WBE subcontractor to
resolve the problem. Where there has been a mistake or disagreement about the scope of
work, the MBE or WBE can be substituted only where an agreement cannot be reached
for a reasonable price for the correct scope of work.

(3)

Substitutions of the subcontractor shall be permitted only on the following bases:

(4)

(i)

Unavailability after receipt of reasonable notice to proceed.

(ii)

Failure of performance.

(iii)

Financial incapacity.

(iv)

Refusal by the subcontractor to honor the bid or proposal price.

(v)

Mistake of fact or law about the elements of the scope of work of a solicitation

the County, the Contractor shall make Good Faith Efforts to fulfill the Utilization Plan.
The Contractor may seek the assistance of the Office of Contract Compliance in
obtaining a new MBE or WBE. If the Project Specific Goal(s) cannot be reached and
Good Faith Efforts have been made, the Contractor may substitute with a non-Certified
Firm.

(6)

If the County requires the substitution of a MBE or WBE subcontractor listed in the
Utilization Plan, the Contractor shall undertake Good Faith Efforts to fulfill the
Utilization Plan. The Contractor may seek the assistance of the Office of Contract
Compliance in obtaining a new MBE or WBE subcontractor. If the Goal(s) cannot be
reached and Good Faith Efforts have been made, the Contractor may substitute with a
non-Certified Firm.

(d)
If a Contractor plans to hire a subcontractor on any scope of work that was not previously
disclosed in the Utilization Plan, the Contractor shall obtain the approval of the CC Director to modify the
Utilization Plan and must make Good Faith Efforts to ensure that MBES and WBEs have a fair
opportunity to bid on the new scope of work.
(e)
Changes to the scopes of work shall be documented by the User Department at the time

(f)
Prior to contract closeout, the CC Director shall evaluate the Contractor's fulfillment of
the contracted goals, taking into account all approved substitutions, terminations and changes to the
contract's scope of work. If the County determines that Good Faith Efforts to meet the MBE or WBE

RESOLUTION
NEW PROCEDURES FOR REVIEWING WORKERS’ COMPENSATION CLAIMS
WHEREAS, currently when a workplace accident occurs in the County, the injured employee completes
an employee accident report, the employee’s supervisor completes an investigation report and any
witnesses complete witness reports and then an adjuster from Risk Management makes a determination of
whether or not the claim is compensable under the Illinois Workers’ Compensation Act; and
WHEREAS, under the current system, the adjusters do not have an opportunity to follow up with the
injured employee to ask questions to help them make a determination, and they instead solely rely on the
accident reports; and
WHEREAS, an employee without insurance experience might not know all of the information an
adjuster needs to make an accurate determination regarding the claim; and
WHEREAS, a system shall be created and implemented that will allow the adjuster to interview the
injured employee either in person or by telephone and record a conversation reviewing the details of the
accident in order to help the adjuster make an accurate determination on the claim; and
WHEREAS, such a system will help employees, who did not do a good job documenting the accident,
get an accurate and appropriate decision regarding their claim and it will help the County discourage and
reject fraudulent claims; and
WHEREAS, saving recorded accident interviews will help both the County and the injured employee if
details on the accident are needed in the future and at trial; and

purpose; and
WHEREAS, the recordings of investigative interviews shall be preserved by Cook County Risk
Management and the State’s Attorney’s Office shall have access to these recordings when necessary; and
WHEREAS, to facilitate the proper interviewing of all injured employees, this new system shall be
created so as to allow interviews and investigations seven days a week, which will allow all employees to
report alleged work related injuries within 24 hours from the time of the accident; and
WHEREAS, the interview and recording of witnesses shall also be allowed when deemed appropriate by
the facts of a particular case; and
WHEREAS, this Resolution shall in no way obviate the employee’s current requirement to complete a
written accident report immediately following an alleged work injury. Witnesses shall also complete a
written witness statement as is currently the practice; and
WHEREAS, all Departments of Cook County and elected Cook County Offices shall create and
implement rules consistent with the intent of this Resolution.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the President and Cook County Board of

IN HONOR OF THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO LOST THEIR LIVES
WHILE DEFENDING OUR NATION THIS MEMORIAL DAY 2011
WHEREAS, formerly known as Decoration Day, Memorial Day is observed on the last Monday of May
in commemoration of the U.S. soldiers who died while in the military service; and
WHEREAS, Memorial Day was officially proclaimed on May 5,1868 by General John Logan, national
commander of the Grand Army of the Republic, in his General Order No. 11, in which he calls: “Let us,
then, at the time appointed gather around their sacred remains and garland the passionless mounds above
them with the choicest flowers of spring-time; let us raise above them the dear old flag they saved from
dishonor; let us in this solemn presence renew our pledges to aid and assist those whom they have left
among us a sacred charge upon a nation's gratitude, the soldier's and sailor's widow and orphan” and
WHEREAS, Memorial Day was first observed on May 30, 1868, when flowers were placed on the
graves of Union and Confederate soldiers at Arlington National Cemetery, and was extended after World
War I to honor Americans who have died in all wars; and
WHEREAS, on May 2, 2000, President Bill Clinton issued a Memorandum on the White House Program
for the National Moment of Remembrance, “encouraging individual department and agency personnel,
and Americans everywhere, to pause for one minute at 3:00 p.m. (local time) on Memorial Day, to
remember and reflect on the sacrifices made by so many to provide freedom for all.” This important step
was followed on December 2000 by the passing of the National Moment of Remembrance Resolution
which asks for all Americans "To voluntarily and informally observe in their own way a moment of
remembrance and respect, pausing from whatever they are doing for a moment of silence or listening to
'Taps’."
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and Members of the Cook County Board
of Commissioners do hereby recognize Monday, May 30, 2011 as Memorial Day, and join and encourage
all residents of Cook County to renew our pledge to aid the widows, widowers, and orphans of our fallen
dead, to aid the disabled veterans and to commit our minds and hearts to reflect upon the ultimate
sacrifices made by those in service to our country; and
