update. He noted that the awards, which are for one year of funding, will be announced September 30, 2019 for project
implementation to begin October 1, 2019.
o OMHAS SOR Minorities Grant - The population to be served is African American and Hispanic/Latinos
with a diagnosis of Opioid Use Disorder (OUD). Mr. Osiecki noted that the Board has worked with
community partners to identify needs specific to minority communities struggling with OUD. Through this
funding the Board and its partners will 1) increase access to Narcan; 2) increase access to MedicationAssisted Treatment (MAT); 3) conduct outreach and awareness campaigns with targeted messaging; 4)
expand peer support; 5) increase access to recovery housing for underinsured/uninsured women.

o

The estimated total request was $1,000,000.00; with the following 5 providers and estimated amount of
request for each provider agency as follows:
Hispanic UMADAOP
$56,968.00

Cleveland UMADAOP

OMHAS SOR Increasing Access and Services to High Risk Families – The population to be served is
African American and Hispanic/Latino families in which an adult or youth has been diagnosed with OUD
and is engaged in the child welfare, foster care, or criminal justice systems. The Board has worked with
the Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) to ensure coordination with its current service
array and the needs of families. This proposal aims to provide immediate access to assessment and
referral by 1) placing a diagnosing clinician at DCFS to assess and refer families for OUD treatment and
support; 2) providing support and consultation for child welfare staff; 3) increasing access to Narcan; 4)
increasing access to MAT; 5) expanding peer support; and 6) expanding recovery housing for families
engaged in MAT.

request for each provider agency as follows:

amount that was received in 2019. This application is due on October 2, 2019. She also noted that these provider

o Cuyahoga County Board of Health (CCBOH) Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Cooperative
Agreement – The CCBOH has received a cooperative agreement award from the Centers for Disease
Control. The Overdose Data to Action project will expand rapid data collection efforts to better direct
prevention and treatment linkage efforts. The CCBOH will receive $4.4 Million each year for three years.
Project year one runs from September 1, 2019 through August 31, 2020. The Board will receive
approximately $100,000.00 per year. The CCBOH expects to issue contracts by September 23, 2019.
The Board is a sub awardee in this project and is responsible for two activities:
1. The Board will support the integration of State and Local Prevention activities by hiring
a fulltime Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) Specialist to assist with the enhancement of the
Countywide Overdose Fatality Review (OFR) Committee. The goal of this committee is
to determine which deaths from OUD were preventable and what data-driven,
community based efforts are needed to prevent future fatalities of the same nature.
The OUD Specialist will collect in-depth case information and data related to OUD
mortality from survivors and families who consent to interview as part of follow up to
death scene investigations and create written summaries of case information.
2. The Board will support continued partnerships with safety forces and first responders by
working in collaboration with key law enforcement personnel to provide ongoing, system
wide cross training to public safety forces (law enforcement, EMS and Dispatch) across
the county to raise awareness of new partnerships, programs and challenges regarding
the opioid epidemic locally.
▪ Northeast Ohio Collaborative: Withdrawal Management/Detoxification and Crisis Bed Expansion – Mr. Osiecki
reported that the Board will continue to be the fiscal agent on behalf of the Northeast Ohio Collaborative. He noted that
$1.5 Million was received for this endeavor; which included $250,000.00 for mental health crisis. The additional
participating Boards have graciously allowed the ADAMHS Board of Cuyahoga County to retain these funds. As a
result, these funds will be utilized to expand children’s crisis beds. The Boards will also continue to contract with the
same providers; however, additional providers may be included in the future. Mr. Osiecki stated that the ADAMHS
Board may start taking an administrative fee for participating as the fiscal agent again.
Dr. Fowler inquired about the state funding algorithm. Mr. Osiecki reported that this matter will not be discussed until
sometime during this upcoming fiscal year; which means that changes will not transpire until State Fiscal Year (SFY) 20222023. Mr. Osiecki noted that when this matter is discussed at the state level, he will be an active participant.
Ms. Kirkland inquired about funding decisions related to programs being funded that are struggling. Mr. Osiecki noted that
these funds may be reallocated to programs that are doing well; to purchase new services that are missing in the present
provider system; and/or utilized for one time program/service funding.
Mr. Osiecki reported that the Board has provided fiscal and programmatic technical assistance to LifeWorks Behavioral
Health Solutions and that they are anticipating hiring a business manager in the near future to provide assistance with
financial matters.
There being no further business, the meeting adjourned at 4:41 p.m.
