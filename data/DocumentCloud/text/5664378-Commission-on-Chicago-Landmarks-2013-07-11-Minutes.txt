on Chicago Landmarks (the "Rules and Regulations"), that the significant historical or
architectural features are all exterior elevations and rooflines; (b) Preliminarily find that the
subject building, a 2-story frame house constructed c. 1890, contributes to the character of
the East Village District, which includes narrow lots with cottage and apartment buildings
built in a wide variety of architectural styles during the late 19th and early 20th centuries; (c)
Preliminarily find that the demolition of a contributing building or structure within a
landmark district is a per se adverse effect on the significant historical and architectural
features, pursuant to Article III, Section G.3.b., of the Rules and Regulations; (d) Pursuant to
Section 2-120-780 of the Landmarks Ordinance, preliminarily find that the demolition of the

features of the property and the district; and, (e) Issue a preliminary decision disapproving
the demolition application.
The owners’ attorney asked that the Commission approve the demolition application.
Mr. Shure informed the Commission that a preliminary decision disapproving the demolition
application would trigger an informal conference and, if the informal conference did not

with the provisions of the Chicago Landmarks Ordinance.

6. Pre-Permit Submission – Signage Related to Historic Protected Features (as defined by
the Wrigley Field Designation Ordinance)
WRIGLEY FIELD
1060 W. Addison St.

WARD 44

Eleanor Gorski presented the staff report for the proposal of three outfield signs, two light
standards, and modifications to the previously approved master sign program. It was noted
that the size and position of the proposed outfield signs had recently been negotiated and the
final sizes and images were not depicted accurately in the power point or master sign
program. Staff presented the final size of the left field LED board at 48’ in height x 95’ in
width. The neon script sign above the LED board was not yet determined. The final size of
the right field neon script sign was presented at 650 square feet. The presentation included an
overview of the stadium’s protected features, governing provisions of the master sign

 program, and design parameters. Michael Lufrano, Vice President for Community Affairs
for the Chicago Cubs, made a brief statement about the project and provided additional
details. Alderman Tom Tunney spoke in opposition of the signs.
Chairman Leon called for questions by the Commission members to clarify any information
regarding the proposed signs and staff recommendations. The public was then invited to
make public comment; approximately 60 members of the public presented statements.
Commission staff and the applicant’s representatives were recalled to address additional
questions of the Commission. There were additional questions and further discussion by the
Commission.
A motion was made to accept the staff recommendation for the installation of the proposed
outfield signs, light standards, and modifications to the master sign program with the stated
conditions of approval as follows:
The Commission found that, with the following conditions, the proposed signs and light
standards as proposed would meet the criteria set forth in the Commission’s Rules and
Regulations, Commission’s Guidelines For Alterations to Historic Buildings and New
Construction, the U.S. Secretary of the Interior’s Standards For Rehabilitation of Historic
Buildings, and any specific guidelines stated in the Wrigley Field Designation Ordinance and
therefore would not adversely affect the significant historical and architectural features of the
landmark pursuant to sec. 2-120-770 of the municipal code and preliminarily approve the
project with the following conditions:
1. Any of the information submitted by the applicant that references the size of the outfield
signs will need to be updated to match the agreed-upon sizes approved at the July 1, 2013
CCL meeting. A final draft of the corrected documents will be submitted as a record copy to
Historic Preservation staff before application of any permits.
2. Final details, specifications, cut-sheets, etc. for the proposed signs and lighting shall be
submitted for Historic Preservation staff review and approval as part of the permit
application. Any major change (as determined by the Commission staff) to the size, location
or height of the proposed sign shall be submitted to the Commission for review pursuant to
Article III, Sec. C(2) of the Commission’s Rules and Regulations.
3. The exterior of the right field sign and the neon left field sign will be a matte green paint
to match the exterior of the ballpark.
4. The exterior of the left field LED board will be designed with an architectural treatment
that will be reviewed pre-permit with Historic Preservation staff.
5. The Commission will consider future outfield sign proposals relative to the cumulative
visual impact of signage on the historic and architectural character of the ballpark. The size,
scale and spacing between signs would all be considered in future proposals.

 Master Sign program revisions:
The revisions presented were adopted as part of the Master document. It was noted that per
the Wrigley Field Landmark Ordinance, Section 6, the time frame of the Program is the
earlier of (a) 20 years from the date of acceptance by the CCL (i.e., July 11, 2013) and (b) the
period of de facto controlling ownership of either Wrigley Field, the Cubs or any person or
entity with de facto controlling ownership of Wrigley Field or the Cubs.
Motioned by Dziekiewicz, seconded by Mooney. Approved unanimously. (6-0)
