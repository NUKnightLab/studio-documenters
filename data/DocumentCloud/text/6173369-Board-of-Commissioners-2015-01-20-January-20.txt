In the absence of Committee Chair Bridget Reidy, Commissioner Markowski presented the

commissioners and the public, but, for the record, no vote was taken.
On behalf of the Operations & Facilities Committee, Commissioner Markowski then presented
an Omnibus Motion for the approval of Items 2 through 7.
(Item 2)
A specific strategy associated with Plan Forward includes preserving affordable housing units
and leveraging private resources through HUD’s Rental Assistance Demonstration program
while maintaining affordability. CHA has applied to transition 10,935 units under RAD. While
the portfolio application is still in queue, HUD has encouraged CHA to proceed with steps to
prepare for RAD implementation. Accordingly, in preparation for a RAD award, the resolution
for Item 2 approves Chapter 18 of the Administrative Plan that details the policies, processes and
procedures related to administrating the Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) program and
the accompanying lease documents and grievance policy referenced in the Administrative Plan
amendment. The RAD chapter of the Administrative Plan will act as the governing policy
document to guide CHA and property management in properly administrating processes and
procedures related to the RAD program. In addition to the formal public hearings, presentations
were made at the December 2014 SHAC and CAC Board meetings to provide residents and
stakeholders additional opportunities to provide comments on the available documents.
RESOLUTION NO. 2015-CHA-2
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the
Board letter dated January 14, 2015 requesting approval to amend the HCV
Administrative Plan to include policies for Rental Assistance Demonstration
(RAD) properties and adopt the form of residential lease agreements for RAD
properties and the RAD Grievance Policy.
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY:

2

 THAT,

the Board of Commissioners hereby approves the amendment to the HCV
Administrative Plan – inclusive of Chapter 18: Policies for RAD Properties.

THAT,

the Board of Commissioners hereby approves the documents accompanying the
amendment to the Administrative Plan, including the FY2015 RAD Residential
Lease Agreement, the Addendum to RAD Lease for RAD Residents in MixedIncome Developments, and the CHA RAD Grievance Procedure.

(Item 3)
The CHA Significant Actions Policy states that Board approval must be obtained prior to CHA
incurring liabilities in excess of $100,000. Modernization activities, change orders, or cumulative
change orders in excess of 5% of the contract amount or $100,000, whichever is greater, must
also receive Board approval. Accordingly, the resolution for Item 3 approves ratification of an
emergency contract with Madison Construction for Life and Safety and Plumbing Riser
Replacement at Lidia Pucinska Apartments in the amount of $30,826.77. The work in this
change order was completed on December 2, 2014. Staff has verified that the amount to perform
the work by the contractor was within an acceptable range of the CHA’s Independent Cost
Estimate.
RESOLUTION NO. 2015-CHA-3
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated January 14,

(Item 4)
In late 2013, a contract reconciliation exercise revealed that there were change orders scopes of
work claimed by various vendors that did not receive prior approval from CHA. After
identifying these liabilities, staff embarked on a detailed order scrubbing of all of its active
contracts to identify the after-the-fact work, validate that the work was completed, determine if
the work was requested by the CHA, research whether the CHA had knowledge of the work, and
ascertain if the work was necessary to complete the projects and whether the work provided a
benefit to the CHA and its residents. Staff verified that the cost to perform the work by each

3

 contractor was within an acceptable range of the CHA’s Independent Cost Estimate for each
project. Simultaneous with the after-the-fact discovery exercise, staff developed a series of
process improvements designed to eliminate the number of incidences of work being performed
without proper authorization from the CHA. Accordingly, the resolution for Item 4 approves
ratification of a contract amendment with Globetrotters and also ratifies task order modifications
to various other contractors and prime design consultants as referenced in the below resolution.

(Item 5)
The CHA advertised a Request For Proposal (RFP) for Construction Payment Escrow Services
in July 2014. The RFP was advertised in area newspapers. Additionally, 71 Assist Agencies, and
186 Section 3 Hires received notification that the solicitation was available for downloading
from the CHA Buyspeed portal. CHA also directly solicited 126 firms, posted the solicitation on
CHA’s website and in Buyspeed. A Pre-Proposal meeting was held in July 2014 with no firms
attending. Since no proposals were received, this procurement was re-advertised in September
2014. The RFP was again advertised in area newspapers and CHA also directly solicited 43
firms, posted the solicitation on CHA’s website and in Strategic Sourcing. One proposal was
received from Greater Illinois Title Company. After the evaluation committee completed its
analysis of the proposal and Greater Illinois' best and final offer, it was determined that it was in
CHA's best interest to award Greater Illinois Title a two-year base contract with three (3) oneyear options for a full contract value not-to-exceed $600,000 for construction payment escrow

4

 services. Accordingly, the resolution for Item 5 approves award of contract to Greater Illinois
Title Company.
RESOLUTION NO. 2015-CHA-5
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated January 14,
2015 entitled “AUTHORIZATION TO EXECUTE CONTRACT WITH
GREATER ILLINOIS TITLE COMPANY FOR CONSTRUCTION ESCROW
SERVICES”
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to enter into a contract with Greater Illinois Title Company for an
amount not-to-exceed $600,000 for a two (2) year base term, including three (3),
one-year options.
This award is subject to the Contractor’s compliance with the CHA’s
MBE/WBE/DBE, Section 3, and bonding and insurance requirements.

(Item 6)
In June 2014, CHA issued a Request for Proposal (RFP) soliciting competitive proposals for a
web-based construction management software system and professional implementation services.
The RFP was advertised in area newspapers, on the CHA website, and on BuySpeed Online. Of
the 7 bids received, two were M/W/DBE vendors. Based on the recommendation of the
evaluation committee and best and final fee proposal, e-Builder is the recommended awardee.
Since 1995, e-Builder has provided software and services for capital program and construction
project management and has successfully implemented e-Builder Enterprise at more than 40
government and infrastructure organizations. e-Builder is also the leading provider of fully
integrated, cloud-based construction program management software with an owner-centric focus
and is focused exclusively on meeting the needs of repeat builders in the construction industry.
Accordingly, the resolution for item 6 approves award of contract to e-Builder, Inc. for the
provision and implementation of construction management software for the firm fixed price of
$1,498,290.00. The contract total includes implementation, licensing and maintenance and
support services in year one of $ 715,090 and ongoing maintenance and support in years two
through five of $195,800, respectively.
RESOLUTION NO. 2015-CHA-6
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated January 14
2015 entitled “AUTHORIZATION TO EXECUTE A CONTRACT WITH eBuilder, Inc. FOR CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE”
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to enter into a contract, with a two year base period and three (3) one
year options, with e-Builder, Inc. for Construction Management Software for the
firm fixed price of $1,498,290.
This award is subject to the Contractor’s compliance with the CHA’s applicable
MBE/WBE/DBE, Section 3, and bonding and insurance requirements.

(Item 7)
The resolution for Item 7 approves the 1-year option period of Contract No. 11293 with the Law
Bulletin Publishing Company for an amount not-to-exceed $47,016 to allow the Office of the
General Counsel (OCG) continued necessary access to the Law Bulletin's on-line public court
records including court dockets, case histories and scheduling information. The OGC requires
on-line services to access case history, court dockets and scheduling information as it relates to
legal matters to support its in-house litigation staff. The CHA has contracted with the Law
Bulletin on a non-competitive basis since 1989 to provide the Office of the General Counsel
access to the public court dockets, case histories and scheduling information. The Law Bulletin
is the sole source authorized by the court systems to provide private entities with online access to
public court records.
