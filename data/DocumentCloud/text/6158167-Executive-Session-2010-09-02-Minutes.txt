Mary Pat Burns addressed the Trustees. She advised that the Illinois Attorney General (AG) was
conducting a confidential investigation into custodial practices with respect to foreign exchange
trading. She further reported that the AG had requested information from the Fund regarding our
custodian. That request came in the form of a confidential letter. Ms. Burns explained that she
attempted to obtain a “no target” letter from the AG but was told that as an office practice they did
not issue such letters. She explained that she was given verbal assurances that we were not a target
and that if that were to change we would be advised accordingly. She also explained that the AG
does have subpoena powers and could subpoena the records.
Ms. Burns further explained that the AG’s position is that they would be acting on behalf of the
Funds and other State of Illinois agencies in any action against the custodian resulting from the
investigation and that the request was not an adversarial one. She further stated that the AG
indicated that in the event action was taken and a favorable decision or settlement was obtained the
Fund may benefit. Ms. Burns reminded the Trustees that lawsuits were pending in California with
respect to foreign exchange practices of some custodians and in her opinion the AG’s investigation
was in response to that.

 She indicated that we did produce documents pursuant to the request and that all the documents were
public records. Those documents included a Request for Proposal issued by the Fund in 2007 and
responses thereto, the contract the Fund entered into with our custodian and a list of our investment
managers.
Ms. Burns recommended that we continue to cooperate with the investigation.
It was moved by Trustee Fitzgerald and seconded by Trustee Benjamin that, no formal action being
taken, the Executive Session be adjourned and that the Board return to open session.
Vote Result: MOTION ADOPTED UNANIMOUSLY BY VOICE VOTE.
