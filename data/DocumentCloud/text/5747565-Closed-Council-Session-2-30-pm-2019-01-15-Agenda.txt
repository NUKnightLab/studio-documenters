62. Submitting report and Proposed Ordinance to amend Chapter 26 of the 1984
Detroit City Code, Housing; by adding Article IX, Senior Citizen Housing, by
adding Sections 26-9-1 through 26-9-5, to indicate the purpose of the ordinance;
set forth definitions; to require alternative emergency energy sources; and to
address the enforcement of this ordinance. (FOR INTRODUCTION AND
SETTING OF A PUBLIC HEARING?)

63.

Submitting report relative to 50% Parking Fine Discount for Detroit Residents.
(The City of Detroit is authorized by state law to regulate parking within
City limits. Equal protection challenges to an ordinance that provides 50%
fine reduction to residents would be decided by use of “rational basis” test,
and the ordinance’s purpose of assisting Detroiters of limited means and
providing better access to City services on metered streets (like City offices
located downtown) may be adequate to provide a rational basis for disparate
treatment. However, the ordinance may have a difficult time with a challenge
under the Privileges and Immunities analysis. There, a 50% discount may
seem too great, as demonstrated in case law, and a lesser amount may be
easier to defend. In order to avoid being such an outlier, Detroit’s interests in
this may be better served with a 25% discount; this could be closer to the
20% discount offered in the City of Miami.)

these ordinances need to be held until the lease agreement for the land is also
ready for consideration. The Mayor’s Office foresees it being complete in
February. The Zoning Ordinance specifies that if a CPC recommendation is
not acted upon within 120 days, it is deemed to have been denied. In order
for the CPC recommendation to remain in force, Your Honorable Body will
need to act to extend the review period of these amendments beyond the
January 16, 2019 “expiration date.”)
