Comm. No. 244388
Transmitting a Communication, dated June 14, 200 I from
WILLIAM R. MORAN, County Commissioner
Submitting a request from
TERRENCE BRIDE, Project Director, Flying J, Richton Park Travel Plaza
Re:

Intergovernmental Cooperation Agreement between Cook County and the Village of
Richton Park

Flying J has postponed deve lopment of our proposed Richton Park travel plaza due to the
potential impact of the Cook County Motor Fuels Taxes on our ability to compete successfully in
the market. The current 6 cent per gallon county motor fuels tax is not applied in Will County
just one mile to the south.
Recently we met with you and county staff to convey our concern and to request your ass istance
with coordinating county mitigation of this large tax differential. A packet of information for the
evaluation of the Cook County Board of Commissioners and staff for their upcoming June 19th
Board Meeting has bee n submitted. This includes the following:
•

An introduction

•

A draft cooperative agreement

•

Fiscal Benefit Analysis

•

Project Tax Analysis

The proposed cooperation agreement creates a mechanism which forwards nearly all of the
dollars collected through motor fuel taxes to the Village to then be returned to Flying J as an
economic development incentive to locate in the Village of Richton Park.
It is o ur s incere desire that we find resolution to thi s issue as soon as possible. With the
assistance of the county our development may sti ll become a rea lity benefiting all concerned.

Commissioner Daley, seconded by Commissioner Lechowicz, moved to suspend the rules so that this
matter may be considered. The motion carried unanimously.
Commissioner Collins, seconded by Commiss io ner Moran, moved that Communication No. 244388 be
discharged from the Committee on Business and Economic Development. The motion to discharge
carried unanimously.
Commissioner Collins, seconded by Commissioner Sutker, moved that Communication No. 244388 Intergovernmental Cooperation Agreement between Cook County and the Village of Richton Park be
received and filed. The motion carried unanimously.

RESOLUTIONS
Transmitting a Communication, dated November 21, 2001 from

Re :

Cook County Utility Coordination Council
Enactme nt Resolution
Fiscal Impact: N one

The Illino is Complied Statutes fo r highways regarding consent for construction, rules, regulations and
specifications, 605 ILCS 5/9-113 (copy submitted), was recently amended to include county highway
authorities under its provisions. For Cook County to acquire the maximum benefit of this ame nded
Statute, it is necessary for the Coun ty to establish a Uti lity Coordi nation Counc il on or before January I,
2002.
The duties of such a Coordinatio n Counc il would be to establish and implement effective
communications w ith public and private utilities so as to avoid costly delays in the relocation of their
facilities which conflict with highway improvements. These duties are no different than the existing
scope of Highway Department practices. However, a major provision of the amendment is to g ive the
County legal recourse in dealing with non-respons ive utilities. For this reason, I recomme nd that Cook
County establish a Utility Coordination Council.
I have therefore prepa red the submitted Resolution establishing the Cook County Utility Coord ination
Counc il. It is respectfully requested that, should your Honorable Body concur in this recommendation,
the resolution be adopted and that three (3) certified copies be returned to this Department for processing
to the Illino is Department of Transpo rtation.

utility company, municipal corporation or other public or pri vate corporation, association or person s hall
be located, pl aced or constructed upo n, under or along any highway or upon any townshi p or district road,
without first obtaining the written consent of the appropriate highway authori ty ; and
Whereas, subsection (b) of said Section, as recently amended, authori zes county highway autho rit ies to
promulgate reasonable and necessary rules, regulations and specifications for adm inistration of said
Section; and
Whereas, said subsection ( b) further authorizes county highway autho rities to adopt coordination
strategies and practices des igned and intended to establish and implement effective communication
respecting planned highway projects that the county highway authority believes may require removal,
relocation or modifications in accordance with subsection (f) of said Section. The strategies and practices
adopted shall include but not be limited to the delivery of 5 year programs, annual programs, and the
establishment of coord inat ion counc ils in the locales and with the utility partic ipation that will best
facilitate a nd accomplish the requirements of the County highway authority acting under subsection (f) of
said Section ; and

202

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 18, 2001

Whereas, said subsection (b) further provides for the establishment of coordination council organized by a
county highway authority and shall include the County Engineer/(Superintendent of Highways), the
County Board Chairman/(Pres ident) or hi s or her designee and with such utility participation as will best
facilitate and accomplish the requirements of highway authority acting under subsection (t) of said
Section; and
Whereas, in accordance with subsection (b), said coordination council must be established on or before
January 1, 2002 and the 90 day deadline for the removal, relocation, or modification of the ditches, drains,
track, rails, poles, wires, pipe line, or other equipment in subsection (t) of said Section shall be
enforceable (only) upon the establishment of said coordination council.
Now Therefore, Be It Resolved by the Board of Commissioners of Cook County, Illinois, that in
compliance with 605 ILCS 5/9-113, the Cook County Utility Coordination Council is hereby established
effective the date of this Resolution; and

INCREASE OF TRAVEL PAYMENT FOR J URORS (PROPOSED RESOLUTION).
Submitting a Proposed Resolution sponsored by William R. Moran; Co-sponsored by Carl R.
Hansen, County Commissioners:
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, the current statutes provide jurors be paid $15.00 per day for their time and
$2.20 per day for travel; and
WHEREAS, for some residents of Cook County it costs more than $2.20 to travel back and
forth to some of the Cook County court houses; and
WHEREAS, parking for those assigned to the Daley Center exceeds the $ 17.20 per day that
they are paid; and
WHEREAS, many times a juror is called upon to serve for six hours a day so that their pay
on those days would be $2.50 per hour; and
WH EREAS, Grand Jurors must serve every day for a month, and sometimes continue
periodically beyond that for up to eighteen months; and
WH EREAS, other jurors serve anywhere from one day to weeks depending on the case they
are ass igned to hear; and
WH EREAS, many residents are se lf employed or work at minimum wage jobs so that their
civic duty as a juror requires them to lose substantial sums of money by being a juror; and
WH EREAS, this financial burden induces many to avoid jury duty thus limiting the pool of
jurors and even cal ling in to question whether the jury pool is a true re presentation of the
county; and
WHEREAS, it is the public policy to encourage and a llow participation by all residents in the
jury process; and
WH EREAS, State Statute (55 ILCS 5/4- 11 00 I) establishes the amount juror's are paid, but
the County Board is a llowed to set the travel expense for jurors; and
WHEREAS, it is within the authority of the Cook County Board of Commissioners to
increase the amount jurors are paid for parking; and
WHEREAS, increasing the amount citizens are paid for jury duty wou ld increase the number
of people able to perform their duty by serving as jurors.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the travel pay ment for a juror be increased to
no less than $20.00 per day.

INTERGOVERNM ENTAL COOPERATION AGREEMENT BETWEEN COOK COUNTY
AND THE VILLAG E OF RI CHTON PARK. Transmitting a Communication, dated June
14, 200 I from William R. Moran, County Commissioner, submitting a request from Terrence
Bride, Project Director, Flying J, Richton Park Travel Plaza:
Re:

Intergovernmental Cooperation Agreement between Cook County and the Village of
Richto n Park

Flyi ng J has postponed development of our proposed Richton Park travel plaza due to the
potential impact of the Cook County Motor Fuels Taxes on o ur ability to compete
successfully in the market. The current 6 cent per gallon county motor fue l tax is not applied
in Will County just o ne mile to the south.
Recently we met w ith you and county staff to convey our concern and to req uest your
assistance with coordinating county mitigatio n of this large tax differential. A packet of
information for the evaluation of the Cook County Board of Commissioners and staff for
their upcoming June 19th Board Meeting has been submitted. T his includes the fo llowing:
•

An introduction

•

A draft cooperative agreement

•

Fiscal Benefit Analysis

•

Project Tax Analys is

The proposed cooperation agreement creates a mechanism which forwards nearly all of the
dollars collected through motor fuels taxes to the Village to then be returned to Flying J as an
economic development incentive to locate in the Vil lage of Richton Park.
It is our s incere desire that we find resolution to this issue as soon as possible. W ith the
ass istance of the county our development may still become a rea lity benefiting all concerned.

NOTE: This matter was also referred to the Committee on Business and Economic
Development. (Sec Comm. No. 244388).

Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Law Enforcement and Corrections Committee of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County met
pursuant to notice on Wednesday, October I0, 200 I at the hour of I I :00 A. M. in the Board Room, Room
569, of the County Bui lding, 118 North C lark Street, C hicago, Illino is.
Your Committee has discussed and made the following requests for additional information for further
consideration on the subject matter as follows:

3 18

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDI NGS FOR DECEMBER 18, 200 I

Following the call of the meeting, C hairman More no stated the purpose of the meeting was to fol low-up
on information previously requested at the May 23, 200 1 meeting regarding the inc reased population at
the County Jail.
C hairman Moreno then gave a brief opening statement where he refere nced correspondence, dated
October 5, 2001 , sent to various public safety agencies regard ing the matter and fo llow- up questions fro m
the last meeting. He asked the Secretary to inc lude letters a nd a ll writte n testimony as attachments to the
Committee's report. He a lso stressed the impo1tance of keeping the discussion focused on the current
issue and on gathe ring additional information for the Board that wou ld assist county officia ls and public
safety agencies in finding solutions to a lleviate the fiscal, legal and public safety impact resulting from
the increased jail population.
Previous testimony provided by the Cook County Sheriff, Judicia l Advisory Council, Jo hn Howard
Association, Illino is Prisoner Review Board and the Illinois Department of Corrections was rev iewed.
C hairman Moreno commented that the testimony suggested that recent increases in the jail population and
overcrowding were due to the Illinois Department of Correction's (IDOC) aggressive parole enforcement
policy, known as "Operation Windy City". H e noted that the IDOC's new parole strategy mandates that
state inmates arrested on a v io latio n of parole be held in the coun ty jail , w ithout bond or the option to
participate in a lternative release programs, wh ile they await parole hearings or the adjudication of any
new charges. He said the Sheriffs testimony claimed that the State's new parole policy resulted in placing
the cost of housing state inmates, who violate their paro le agreement, solely on the County a nd increases
the financial burden on the County's taxpayers. Cha irman Moreno said the IDOC denies any state
respons ibility for the overcrowding problem and cla ims that the nu mber of parole vio lators held has not
increased since July 2000. However, C hairman Moreno noted that the committee has not received
requested in formation from the IDOC to substantiate this claim.
Chairman Moreno a lso stressed the importance of keeping the Commissioners briefed on the jai l's
overcrowding s ituation, as it relates to: I) the federal consent decree (Duran v. Sheahan); 2) the fiscal a nd
legal impact on the County 's public safety budget and criminal justice syste m; and, 3) public safety
concerns recently raised in news articles. He stated it was his intention to provide a foundation of
information from state and county agenc ies involved in the parole, court and corrections system that
wou ld assist in prod uc ing an agreed upon plan to proactive ly addresses the fi sca l, legal and public safety
concerns the coun ty and its taxpayers are currently facing.
In closing, C hairma n More no stated in order to accom plish the aforementioned goa ls the committee had a
duty to: I) ferret out the facts, in terms of funding through the county budget, respons ib le or effective
public safety policies and programs; 2) find out if re imbursement for mandated county costs assoc iated
with housing state inmates and parole violators is ava ilable fro m the State of Ill inois; and, 3) to protect the
safety of the public while, at the same time, decreasing taxpayers' share of the costs in managing and
servicing the largest courts and criminal justice system in the nation. In closing, he stressed the
importance of maintaining cooperation benveen the various state and county public safety agencies in
order to foc us on finding recommendations to expedite parole hearings and the adjudication process.
The C ha irman then proceeded to the first item on the agenda:
1.

 JOURNAL OF PROC EEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 18, 2001

In regards to whether statutory provis ions cal l for the State of Illino is to reimburse counties for costs
associated with housing state inmates held in violation of their parole agreement, Ze lda Whittler
responded that the Sheriff does believe the provis ions are applicable to parole violators held in the county
jail, as well as individuals detained w ithout bail. The Undersheriff said the provis ions s hould be used in a
claim for reimbursement from the State on behalf of the county's taxpayers.
As to whether any other county has received reimbursement from the State for costs associated with
hous ing state parole inmates or individuals held without bond, Ms. Whittler stated she would have to get
back to the committee with any information since the Sheriff's staff is still researching the question.
Regarding the status of proposed solutions to alleviate overcrowding, Ms. Whittler stated that the Sheriff
still believes the establishment ofa special court to handle only parole violation cases is a viable solution.
She also recommended opening a temporary state facil ity for parole violators. However, there has not
been any fiscal commitment by the State and agreement by the Illino is Department of Corrections on
these recommendations.
Ms. Whittler stated there are currently I 0,94 7 inmates housed in Cook County Department of Correction
facil ities. She noted that 1,467 of these inmates are 'parole holds' and 55 of those have other warrants
attached to the vio lations.
In response to Commissioner Moran's question regarding if the statute referenced in the Sheriffs written
response would cover reimbursement for patient arrestee c laims, Ms. Whittler stated it was her
understanding that the Sheriff was speaking primarily to inmates with parole holds and those held without
bond. However, she noted that counties are entitled to receive reimbursement for such claims under a
different statutory provision.
Commiss ioner Moran asked Ms. Whittler if she could forward the statutory provision relating to counties
reimbursement of patient arrestee claims. Ms. Whittler said she would get bac k to the Committee with
this information.
In response to Chairman Moreno's question regarding the daily cost of housing a parolee inmate in the
county jai l, Ms. Whittler stated the set off for the county's expenses is $50/day.
Cha irman Moreno asked if the Sheriffs Office had prepared an estimated fiscal impact for costs due to
the county from the State of Illinois for the timeframe between June 2000 through November 30, 2001 .
Ms. Whittler stated that in addition to parole vio lators the statute also applies to inmates held without
bond and based on a pre liminary one month sampling of 77 83 inmates serving 155,345 days in the
CCDOC, the Sheriffs Office estimates a $6 mill ion month ly or a projected annual cost of $60 million to
the Coun ty.
In response to C ha irman Moreno's question regarding the dai ly cost of providing health care to inmates
held in the County's correctional facilities, Ms. Whittler stated she did not have an accurate figure but
estimated the cost at $58 per day.
Referenc ing the most recent response in the Duran case, Commissioner Quigley asked if the Sheriff's
Office was aware that the Cook County Juvenile Detention Center intends on transferring all 17 year old
detainees to the Cook County Department of Corrections. The Commissioner asked the impact this
would have on j ail overcrowding? Ms. Whittler responded she was not prepared to address the issue. She
said the issue might better be addressed by a representative of the State's Attorney's Office.

320

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 18, 200 1

As a point of information, Commissione r Butler noted that the Cook County Department of Corrections
already rece ives 17 year old offenders awa iting trial in the adult court system. He a lso made a brief
observation stating that the addition of juvenile offenders in the jail is only a small piece of the problem.
Ultimate ly, he said the problem is caused by a criminal justice system that is overburdened and out of
control; and unless the Board gets its hands on the system, it will neve r get its hands on the finances.
Commissioner Quigley commented on the need to discuss changes re lative to interna l county policies that
impact the jail po pulation as well as the Board being better informed on such issues s ince they affect the
County's budget.
In response to Chairman Moreno's question regarding if the Sheriffs Office maintains statistics on its
inmates relati ve to the number of no bond detainees and the parole violator detainees, Ms. Whitter stated
would have to get back to Cha ir with this information.
In response to Chairman Moreno's question regarding if the Sheriffs Office has been in touc h w ith the
County T reasurer's Office to begin the process of certifying the county's expenses to the Supreme Court
as stipulated under the statutory provis ion, Ms. Whittler stated the office could not supply this
information to the County Treasurer until the end of the County's fiscal year, November 30, 200 1.
The C hairman asked that a ll requests for further information be submitted to the Chair for future
consideration and that a copy be given to the Secretary to the Board's Office fo r the record. (The
referenced documents are on file in the Office of the County C lerk.)

Chairman Moreno requested that the Sheriff's Office provide a written fiscal impact detailing the
county's costs associated with housing state inmates with ' parole holds' in the county's jail during
fiscal year 2000 and 2001. He asked that the information include the number of days and persons
detained on non-probational offenses where there was no option for bond or alternative release.
Chairman Moreno requested from the Sherifrs Office, an accurate written estimate of the daily
costs associated with providing health care services to inmates in the Cook County Department of
Corrections.
Chairman Moreno also requested that the Sheriff submit in writing his recommendations on
possible solutions to alleviate the overcrowding situation in the Cook County Department of
Corrections.
The Chairman the n moved to second ite m on the agenda and as ked me mbers to ho ld questions on issues
unrelated to the agenda until the e nd of the meeting.

2.

Office of the Cook County State 's Attorney - Civil Actions Bureau.

Chairman Moreno called on a representative of the Cook County State's Attorney 's Office to provide
information on the issue before the court and to follow-up on questions previously requested by the
Comm ittee. (The referenced documents are on file in the Office of the County Clerk.)
Pat Driscoll provided the committee w ith a brief status report o n the recent meeting with Judge Pau l
Biebel and various state, county and public safety agencies on the overcrowding issue as it re lates to the
parole hearing process and cou1t adjudication of paro le violators' cases. He noted the purpose of the
meeting was to continue the discussion o n a series of problems that impact the courts and correctiona l
system thro ughout Illino is. He stated no agreeme nts or recommendations were acted upon to expedite the
parole hearing process or alleviate the court backlog. T he next meeting was scheduled fo r November

2001.

32 1

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 18, 2001

On the issue of the inmates ho used in the county's jail with parole holds, Mr. Driscoll noted as a point of
information that the county no longer holds inmates arrested on technical violations. He stated that all
parole holds cases c urrently held in the county jail represent new charges and must be approached in the
same judiciary manner as any other new case placed on court's docket.
Mr. Driscoll stated that solutions to speed up the court process are difficult s ince each case must be
handled on an individual basis. He said because of time constraints, each case must insure due process
under the law, including the right to counsel and the right to a jury trial on any pending new criminal case.
On the issue of creating a specialized courtroom for parole violation cases, Mr. Driscoll stated that the
proposed solution would not work. He said the State's Attorney's Office is improving its management of
such cases and continues to expedite them as quickly as possible, but he noted there are no quick fixes
applicable from a judiciary perspective to the overcrowding s ituation at the county jail.
In regards to the recent overcrowding situation at the Cook County jail and the affect on the Duran case,
Mr. Driscoll stated that to date the plaintiffs' attorneys have not made any contempt request before the
court. He said the State's Attorney's Office continues to work on a resolution with all the respective
parties invo lved. He said the Board should have received the most recent report from the John Howard
Association. He said the county will be responding to the court on the report and the next hearing will
take place in November 2001.
In closing, Mr. Driscoll assured the committee that the State's Attorney's Office is making all attempts to
comply with the decree and wi ll keep the Board informed of.any new information.
In response to Chairman Moreno's question regarding how many new cases annually are put on the
docket representing inmates with parole holds, Mr. Drisco ll stated there are currently 1467 on the books
and 910 of those were issued in the last four months.
Based on these numbe rs, he projected that approximately 2700 parole hold cases are handled annual ly .
In response to C hairman Moreno's question regarding the number of prisoners whose cases have been
resolved but who are sitting in the jai l awaiting placement in a drug or rehabilitative program, Mr.
Driscoll stated he did not have this information with him but believed Mr. Mahoney with the John
Howard Association wou ld have the best statistics. However, he commented that improving the
coordination of bed space for inmates in the TASC program is a short-tenn solution to reducing the jail
overcrowding.
In response to Chairman Moreno ' s question regarding if the Cook County State's Attorney 's C ivil
Actions Bureau had ever initiated action on behalf of the County' s taxpayers against the State of Illinois
for reimbursement of the costs associated the mandatory housing of state inmates in the county jails, Pat
Driscoll stated the county has not filed any s uit generally because the State of Illinois is not a suitable
entity to sue in a circuit court.
Mr. Driscoll sa id it wou ld be more suitable for the county to seek reimburseme nt from the state under the
statutory provision reference by the Sheriff's office, which sets forth the procedures and authorizes the
County Sheriff to certify to the County Treasurer the numbe r of days persons have been detained in the
custody on non-probational offenses and where there is a no bai l case. He stated the County Treasurer
wou ld then notify the Supreme Court who would reimburse the county (up to $50 for each day a person is
held on a no bail court order) but only if the state legis lature appropriates funds in that fiscal year to cover
the reimbursement expenses.

322

 JO URNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 18, 200 I

As a point of information, Cha irman Moreno noted that the Preside nt's Office has been looking at this
particular issue, in terms of its fi scal impact on the County 's public safety budget, and may be seeking to
secure such budgetary appropriations next year during the Spring leg is lative session.
The Chairman asked that the fo llowing request be submitted to the Chair for future consideration and that
a copy be g iven to the Secretary to the Board's Office for the record:
Chairman Moreno requested that the State's Attorney's Office provide detailed statistics o n the current
1,467 parole ho ld cases, including whether the number of new cases with active warrants, no bail or
alternative release orders attached to the case.
The Chai rman then proceeded to third item on the agenda.

3.

Office of the Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC).

Chairman Moreno called on a representati ve from the Illinois Department of Corrections to address the
status of info rmation previous ly requested by the committee.
Robe rta Fews was recognized for the record and asked if she had received a copy of the letter directed by
the Chairman to the IDOC ' s Assoc iate Director, Mr. George DeTella, that re iterated the questions
requested at the May 23, 200 I meeting. Ms. Fews responded stated s he had not been g iven a copy of the
letter.
Chairman Moreno informed Ms. Fews of the discuss ion that too k place at the last meeting w hich focused
on the Illino is De partment of Correction's (IDOC) newly impleme nted aggressive parole enforcement
po licy in Cook County, known as "Operation Windy C ity".
Roberta Fews responded to the Chairman 's comments by explaining the department's new paro le
initiative referred to as "Operation Windy City" and current policy revisions re lating to state inmates who
vio late the ir parole agreement.
Ms. Fews stated in conjunction with Cook County the department has initiated improvements in its
response to parolee arrests by loca l law enforcement agencies. She stated the department has increased
the numbe r of parole agents in Cook County who are on call 24 hours a day. She said these changes have
created a quicke r response to initial arrests, which allows evaluations to take place at local police stations
and the transfer of parole violators back to IDOC's Joliet facility imm ed iately in order to bypass parolees
placement in the Cook County j ail.
Ms. Fews continued by stating that the I DOC is curre ntly in meetings with various county
officials/agencies and is assisting in the discussion fo r the purpose of finding an agreed upon so lution to
the s ituatio n. She assured the Committee that the Illino is Department of Corrections has and would
continue to stand ready to work with the judiciary, state's atto rneys, and county offic ials on their concerns
involving the IDOC's parole enforcement policies.
In response to C ha irman Moreno's question regarding figures on the number of !DOC inmates on parole
and the parole agents !DOC has to monitor those inmates, Ms . Fews stated there are 29,000 IDOC
inmates currently on parole and 368 parole age nts, of which 240 work in Cook County. She also noted
that the department issued 22,000 warran ts in fiscal year 200 I .

323

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMB ER 18, 2001

In addition, Ms. Fews gave figures on the number of new sentence violators who were transferred from
the Cook County Department of Corrections (CCDOC) facility to the !DOC. She stated in fiscal year
2000 (which ended June 30, 200 I) there were 2851 new sentence violators admitted from Cook County to
the !DOC and in fiscal year 200 I (which started July I, 2001) there were 2626 new sentence violators
admitted from Cook County to the IDOC. She said the figures she cited were based on the number of
transfers from Cook County to the Joliet-RNC facility, only.
Ms. Fews stated the only information the deparnnent received from Cook County was in the form of a
report, titled "Cook County Department of Corrections-Inmates with Parole Violations" dated July 200 I.
According to the report, there were I, 199 parole inmates with active parole holds housed in the CCDOC
facility , of those 971 had parole holds from the !DOC, 83 had parole holds from other agencies and 149
had no holds.
In terms of technical parole violators, Ms. Fews stated all technical violators are currently being
transferred to the I DOC and are not being housed in the CCDOC.
In response to Chairman Moreno's question regarding if the State reimburses any county for its costs
associated with housing state inmates or those held without bond, Ms. Fews stated she did not have any
information regarding the issue.
In response to Commissioner Butler's question regarding who is responsible for contacting the !DOC, Ms.
Fews stated when parole violators are arrested in the suburban areas, the operation center usually notifies
!DOC when warrants are entered in the LEADS system. In the City of Chicago, notification usually is
given by the Chicago Police Department. She said once notification is received by the !DOC, the
department sends a parole agent to begin the evaluation of the violation based on the condition of the
violator's parole and if there are no new charges, the parolee (referred to as a technical violator) is
transferred back to the !DOC.
As a follow-up on Commissioner Butler's question, Ms. Fews noted in fiscal year 1999 there were 1,078
technical violators, in fiscal year 2000 there were 1600 technical violators and in fiscal year 2001 there
were 5646 technical violators returned to !DOC facilities. Ms. Fews said these figures reflect
improvements the IDOC has made in its new parole enforcement strategy in attempting to bypass the
placement of parole violators in the county's facilities.
In response to Commissioner Butler's question regarding the length of time it takes to evaluate and then
transfer a technical violator back to the !DOC, Ms. Fews stated it depends on each case since each parolee
is entitled to a hearing for probable cause.
In response to Chairman Moreno's question regarding the total capacity of beds available in the !DOC
facilities versus the number of inmates currently he ld, Ms. Fews stated she would have to get back to the
committee with this information.
In response to Commi ssioner Quigley's question regarding if she was aware of any response by the !DOC
to the Sheriffs proposed initiatives regarding alternative means of housing state parole holds currently
held on new cases in the Cook County Department of Corrections facilities, Ms. Fews stated she had no
information pertaining to this matter.
In response to Chairman Moreno's question regarding if the state had a facility on Northwestern Avenue
that might be available to detain state parole violators, Ms. Fews stated she was not aware of any facilities
currently available for this purpose.

324

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 18, 2001

Chairman Moreno requested the following information, in writing, from the Illinois Department of
Correction:
1) Has the IDOC reimbursed any county for costs associated with the housing of state
parole violators, or inmates held without bond in county correctional facilities?
2) What is the total capacity of beds available in the IDOC facilities and how many inmates
are currently being held in its facilities?
3) What is the IDOC's response to the Sheriffs proposed initiatives regarding alternatives
means of housing state parole holds currently in the Cook County Department of
Corrections facilities, which were communicated to the department by the Cook County
Sheriff at the May 23, 2001 meeting and also discussed at previous task force meetings
initiated by Judge Biebel to assist in the discussion of solutions to address the legal and
fiscal impact of the State's parole system on the public safety agencies and county
criminal justice systems?
4) Is there any State initiative or current plan being discussed with a county official or
agency regarding a means to release non-violent state parole violators while they await
trial?
In addition, Chairman Moreno requested that answers to the questions asked by the committee, at
its May 23, 2001 meeting, be submitted in writing to the Chairman's Office from the Illinois
Department of Corrections, including written documentation to the claim that the number of
parole violators held in the Cook County Department of Corrections n has not increased since July
2000. (The referenced documents are on file in the Office of the County Clerk.)
The Chairman then proceeded to fourth Item on the agenda.

4.

Judicial Advisory Council (JAC).

Chairman More no ca lled on a re presentative of the Judicial Advisory Council to provide an update on any
legis lative initiatives relat ing to overcrowding at the county jail
The Chairman recognized Kay Schroeder and asked if she could provide any information on legislative
initiatives o r coordination w ith state and county agencies in relation to the issues the county is faces,
under the Duran case, with the recent overcrowding s ituation at the jai l.
Ms. Schroede r stated that she was not aware of any initiative presently be ing considered that might lead to
re imbursement of the county's costs as it relates to housing of state inmates in the county jail. However,
she said Mr. O'Rourke asked her to inform the committee that Bill Quinlan, the Executi ve Director of the
JAC, has been in comm unication with Pres ident Stroger and they a re organ izing a meeting of the
Coordinating Council to discuss the issue. S he ex plained the coordinating counci l is made up of all the
heads of the county public safety offices and agencies, i.e. the Cook County Sheriff, Cook County State's
Atto rney, Cook County's C hief Judge, Bureau C hief of Public Safety and the Judicial Advisory Council.
Chairman Moreno commented o n his frustrat ion w ith the lack of info rmation provided to this commi ttee
regarding such meetings or any reports on the progress of these meetings.

325

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDlNGS FOR DECEMBER 18, 2001

Chairman Moreno requested from the Judicial Advisory Counci l that a summary report of the
coordinating councils meeting or minutes, if available, be forwarded to the Chairman's Office and a copy
sent to the Secretary to the Board for placement in the committee's file for further discussion.
Chairman Moreno also requested information from the Judicial Advisory Council regarding any
initiatives being made, on behalf of the county's taxpayers, to seek reimbursement from the State for the
county's costs associated with the housing of state parole inmates or inmates held without bail in the Cook
County Department of Corrections
The Chairman then moved to questions for the Judicial Advisory Council from the members .
Hearing none, the Chairman proceeded to the fifth item on the agenda.

5.

Illinois Prisoner Review Board.

The Chairman called on a representative of the Illinois Prisoner Review Board to provide any information
on the subject matter.
Hearing no response, Chairman Moreno moved to new items added to the agenda.

6.

John Howard Association - For Prison Reform.

The Chairman called on Mike Mahoney to provide information to the committee relating to the Duran v.
Sheahan et al. case in federal court and any recommendations to alleviate the overcrowding at the county
jail. (The referenced documents are on file in the Office of the County C lerk.)
Mr. Mahoney distributed recent and average daily population figures at the county jail. He informed the
committee that he had been appointed to monitor the Duran case in 1980 and has continued to do so over
the past 20 years. He stated during that time he has found the two main problems in addressing the
s ubject matter: I) the lack of specific data on the inmates housed in the Cook County De partment of
Corrections, specifically inmates personal data (who they are, where the come from and what type of
charge are they being held on), in and out data (arrival dates, release dates and length of time served in the
county jail), and release information (state fac ility, drug and alcohol program (TASC), domestic violence
program, electronic monitoring program, etc.); and 2) the lack of any long-term plan that the county's
public safety agencies can coord inate and fo llow-up on to ensure that the county is not still discussing the
overcrowding problem at the jail twenty years from now in 2021. He stated if the county did nothing else
but foc us on these two items, it would be serving its taxpayers and constituents better.
He stated other unintended consequences that affect this issue is what occurs in the Illinois Legislature.
He said the county is very good at voicing its concerns on unfunded state mandates; however, it needs to
improve its legislative and court advocacy in terms of penalty enhancement bills, state policy changes and
rule changes by the Illinois Courts. He also suggested some means to attach Cook County Department of
Corrections notes onto legislation, similar to those placed on criminal bills by the Illino is Department of
Corrections.
In response to Chairman Moreno's question regarding if there is a state agency or council that advocates
on behalf of counties for their protection, Mr. Mahoney stated he would arg ue that the Illinois Association
of Counties or the Urban Counties Council should be actively advocating for its members.

326

 JOU RNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FO R DECEM BER 18, 200 1

Mr. Mahoney said the re is no quick fi x to the overcrowding proble m at the jail, and stated he agreed w ith
Comm issioner Butler's earlier comme nts regard ing the s ituation being systemic with short and long-range
facto rs that need to be fi rst understood before solutions can be impleme nted. However, he stated there are
some segments that should be looked at and corrected in the short-te rm .
One item raised in Judge Marovic h's courtroom relates to indiv iduals whose cases are resolved but are
sitting in the coun ty j ai 1 awa iting assessment or placement in a T ASC program. He said the problem is
bed space and the lack of substa nce a buse treatment funding, which he noted is a State res pons ib il ity
through the Departme nt of Human Services.
A second item he stated the county should look at were ind iv id uals w ith mental illness w ho do not qualify
fo r the She ri ff s alternative re lease programs because there is no menta l health component. He suggested
that a me ntal health evaluation a nd serv ice provision be added in the screening and service process for the
She riff unde r contracts w ith mental health agencies. He noted the Thresho ld Program as a successful
model the county shou ld look at, which co uld evaluate and work wi th a small segment of the population
in a release program.
A third item he stated re lates to indiv iduals sitting in the coun ty jail with bonds less than $ I 000. He sa id
the Pre-Tri al Serv ice agenc ies sho uld look at that segment of the population to see if any might qua lify fo r
release w ith supe rvision.
In addition, Mr. Mahoney stated the county should look at expa nd ing the S heriffs day reporting and
electronic monitoring program, which he said were model programs nationally. A lso, he mentioned the
county should explore discussions with the judiciary additio na l o ptions in a lternative sentencing for the
inc reasing number of inmates sitting in j a il on misdemeanor and domestic violence c harges.
He pointed o ut that when looking at solutions to reduce the population at the jail, the county should
reme mber the plaintiff c lass unde r the Duran case is intended for is pre-tria l deta inees, not sentenced
offenders. He stated the county's Boot Camp is a good example of a program that addresses the
placement of sentenced offenders, who are not covered under D uran, a nd cou ld be expanded or di verted
by us ing the State's Boot Camp that is rarely fi lled to capacity.
Mr. Mahoney further commented that a short-time capacity c hange to explore is the convers ion of a
nurs ing home that s its next to Div is ion X I a nd the pa rk ing lot, wh ich m ight be taken under eminent
domain or purchased. He sa id he thought the build ing could easily be converted by erecting a fe nce and
security screens a nd could operate at a min imum capacity of 300 to 350.
He said besides buildi ng or converti ng an existing building, the only other short-term capac ity option the
county might want to consi der is to contract with pri vate non-profit prov iders to prov ide work release bed
space at an off-site fac ility for mi n imum security inmates. He noted th is is what the State of Illinois does.
In respo nse to C hairman More no's questio n regarding the Sheriffs proposal to have the State pay for the
construction of a new facility or use an existing State fac ility in Chicago to house paro le deta inees a nd
indiv iduals he ld on no bond, Mr. Ma honey stated he conve ned a meeting between the Sheriffs staff and
the IDOC. As a res ult, he said the IDOC is looking into dedicating one or two of its community operating
centers as a v io lator facility.

327

 JO URNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 18, 2001

In conclusion, Mr. Mahoney cautioned the committee not to rely on the Sheriffs or Judicial Advisory
Council's fi gures on the county's costs for incarceration. He noted he has heard the same dai ly cost per
inmate for seven years. He stressed getting accurate figures from all agencies and factors invo lved in
order to ensure the county does not sell itse lf short in any attempts at reimbursement. He ended by
repeating what Judge Marovich said in chambers at the last meeting he ld on the Duran case, quoting
"Fiscal resources is not a defense of unconstitutional conditions in a correctional institutio n."
Commissioner Quigley made a brief observation, based on Mr. Mahoney's information, that with the
fiscal constraints on the County's and State of Illinois' budgets neither is able to rush out and build a new
correctional fac ility . He stated he believed it was time to re-assess and re-evaluate the laws and the
courts ' decis ions involved that continue to place drug users and non-v io lent offenders in the county j ail,
which is where they serve their time due to the lack of state funding for release programs, such as TASC.
Commissioner Moran commented on the issue of the county's costs for providing services and stated he
introduced a resolution calling for a $25 inmate processing fee but has been unsuccessful in getting a cosponsor.
As a follow-up to Commissio ne r Moran's comments, Chairman Moreno said he welcomed discussing the
Commissioner's resolution if it moves forward at the next Board meeting. However, he said there are
factors that appear to support the argument that the fee is not cost-effective and in the e nd, may result in
costing taxpayers more money to collect.
Also in response to Commissioner Moran's comme nts, Commissioner Butler said he did not second or cosponsor the Commissioner's reso lution because the fee would create more problems than its worth. He
stated it was similar to most of the initiatives on crime that get passed in the State Legislature, which
ultimately do not so lve the problem, but create new ones for someone e lse to pay for and manage.

Chairman Moreno requested that Mr. Mahoney provide information on private non-profit
providers in Cook County, names of agencies who use these services and for what purpose, as well
as how successful the contracted services have been in terms of the overall cost savings to the
taxpayers.
Chairman Moreno asked Mr. Mahoney to provide his recommendation, in writing, to the Chair for
the committees further consideration at its next meeting.
The Chairman the proceeded to the second new item on the agenda.

7.

Cook County President's Office - Legislative Initiatives.

The Chairma n then called on a representative from the President's Office to provide some info rmation on
the President's legislative initiatives relative to the problems the coun ty is fac ing under the Duran case
and the county lobbying effo11s in Springfield relating to the subject matter.
Hearing no response, the C ha irman asked Sandra Overberg, Legislative Coordinator for the Cook County
Board, to respond.
Ms. Overberg said that she could provide the committee with information relati ng to what the President's
Office and County Board has done over the past I 0 years in Springfie ld on the issue, since she has been
coordinating the county's legis lative program fo r the President's Office from 1990 th ro ugh 1994 and for
the County Board since 1995.

328

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 18, 200 I

In summary, Ms. Overberg first prov ided some historical information on legislation she referred to as
"tough on crime" initiatives that stemmed from a national campa ign ten years ago that called fo r stricter,
harsher and more accounta ble c riminal justice and penal systems across the country. S he stated this
"tough on crime campaign" resulted in a significant number of statutory changes in Illinois' C riminal
Code. She noted over the past eight years, due to the inc reased passage of penalty e nhancement laws, the
county has seen a s ignificant increase in the amount of time inmates remain in t he county's jai l and
criminal courts' system. As a result, the county has been ma ndated to increase public safety fu nding in
the County's budget for its correctional, courts and overall crim inal justice system.
Ms. Overberg then briefly reviewed what the President's O ffice and Cook County Board has done in
terms of its lobby ing efforts in Springfield on this issue. She said over the past ten years the county has:
I) testified against the passage of leg is lation that mandated the county to provide services w ithout passing
on the funds to implement them (i.e. unfunded state mandates); 2) provided fiscal impact statements to the
staff and legislative leaders on c riminal bills ( i.e. penalty e nha nceme nt initiatives) that have come before
the House and Senate's Judiciary Committees, showing the county's estimated costs fo r imple menting the
proposed changes in state law; 3) requested State appropriatio ns to assist the county in pay ing for costs
associated with unfunded state mandates ( i.e. criminal penalty enhancement laws); and 4) consistently,
with the assistance of Metro Counties, made the argument to legislative leaders and the Governor's Office
that the financial burden of subs idizi ng Illinois crim inal justice and public safety serv ices have steadily
increased on county government and its taxpayers, while state and federal fina ncial assistance has
continued to decrease.
In addition, she stated during the past Spring session, the President's staff initiated discuss ions with the
Governor's staff regarding the need to increase the county's electronic monitoring program as one possible
means to address the impact the Sta te's new parole e nforcement policy was having on the county's
correctional facilities. At that time, she sa id the county made a request for financial assistance from the
State for the purpose of sharing the cost of purchasing additional e lectronic monitoring equipment.
However, this and other legis lative initiatives were still pending when the General Assembly adjourned in
May 200 I . Ms. Overberg stated she was not aware of any response to the President's request for
assistance or other action o n the part of the state regarding this matter.
In conclus ion, she sa id despite the county's best efforts, on behalf of its taxpayers, to secure financial
assistance from the state for the county's costs associated with implementing mandated public safety and
policy changes, legis lation impacting the county's finances continues to get passed and signed into law
because the argument for being "tough on crime" continues to win in the legislature, as we ll as with the
public when it comes time to vote.
Ms. Overberg commented she believed what Cha irman Moreno is attempting to do through the
Committee's discussion of the issue and the coord ination of gathering the facts/figures in order to find
recommendations from e lected officia ls and the John Howard Association, is to make the reports of this
comm ittee to the Board. Assuming the Committee is s uccessful in producing a final report by the end of
2002, she stated thi s record of updated costs a nd coordinated information, in conj unction with agreed
upon recommendations approved by the Board, wi ll assist in improving the county lobby ing effo11s in
Springfield during the 2003 Spring session. She noted the info rmation should also provide the Board the
info rmation it needs to make necessary cuts and improvements in its fundi ng of programs and services
during the 2003 budgetary process.
The C hairman then proceeded to the last new item on the agenda.

Chairman Sims ca lled on Jackie Harder, Department of Planning and Development to provide a brief
explanation of the item.
Jackie Harder stated that in the report from the De partment of Planning and Development, a question was
raised regarding some of the parcels located in a residential area. Director Harder further commented that
some other parcels should be withdrawn because the name of an elected official is listed in the chain of
title. Ms. Harder stated that the fo llowing parcels are located in a res idential area: PINS 32-23-302-0130000, 32-23-302-026-0000, 32-23-302-029-0000, 32-23-302-030-0000, 32-23-303-019-0000, 32-23-303025-0000, 32-23-303-026-0000, 32-23-414-035, 32-23-41 4-036-0000, 32-23-414-038-0000, 32-23-4 14039-0000, 32-23-414-041-0000, 32-23-414-042-0000, 32-23-303-043-0000, 32-23-414-046-0000, 32-23414-050-0000.
A title search of PINS 32-23- 11 4-052-0000 and 32-23 - 114-053-0000 reveals the name of an elected
official.
Finally, Ms. Harder stated that there are severa l parcels that have Cook County Block Grant liens. She
said the Department of Planning and Development had requested that the municipality agree to pay the
lie ns if the e nd use for the parcel(s) is ineligible under the block grant rules.
Chairman Sims then called on Greg Carney, Director of Tax Reactivation Project to respond .
Greg Carney stated that he concurs with the Department of Planning to withdraw the parcels associated
with the current elected official listed in the chain of title. Mr. Carney further commented that it is true
that very few commercial/industrial properties are contiguous to residential parce ls. He stated that he has
v isited the area with the De partment of Planning and Development and said plans are to use the parcels
for commercial and industrial purposes which the current zon ing ordinance permits. He said that there
are approximately nine (9) parcels in question and asked that these parcels be deferred for further review
and recommendation.
Chairman Sims stated that no one from the committee would object to economic development in Ford
Heights but everyone involved including representatives of the South Suburban Tax Reactivation Project
must fo llow the guidelines.
Chairman Sims stated that requests from the Vi llage of Robbins, the City of Blue Island a nd Markham are
al l being withdrawn.
Commissioner Goslin asked that a schedule be forwarded to Chairman Sims fo r distribution to the
committee.
Mr. Carney responded in the affi rmative.
Commissioner Butler asked why Item 246735 contained requests from numerous municipalities?

Chairma n Sims asked Assistant State's Attorney Randy Kemmer to provide the committee with a brief
explanation of the request.
Randy Kemmer stated that the requested parcel straddles the munic ipal border between Dixmoor and the
C ity of Harvey . He stated that there is a precede nt for this action but results in a problem once a No Cash
Bid is approved. He suggested that the problem sho uld be so lved upfront and that the Village of Dixmoor
and the C ity of Harvey should come to an agreement on the development plans before the No Cash Bid is
approved.
Chairman Sims asked the representative from the Village of Dixmoor to comment on Mr. Kemmer's
recommendation.

334

 JOURN AL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR D EC EM BER 18, 200 I

Attorney Kathleen Field O rr, said she agrees w ith Attorney Kemme r that the development plans should
be so lved upfro nt, however, the Village of Dixmoor has already sent out a Request For Proposal,
advertised and met with potential deve lopers. Ms. Orr further stated that the comm ittee should consider
sending the item to the County Board on the condition that a n agreeme nt is reached between the City of
Ha rvey and the Yi IIage of Dixmoor.
C hairman Sims stated that the committee would not want to be in the pos ition of mak ing a decis ion on the
request until the two municipalities have reached on agreeme nt. The C hairman fu rther stated that the
Mayo r of Dixmoor and the Mayor of Harvey sho uld talk abo ut what is going to happen with the parce l of
land befo re the item is put before the County Board.
Attorney Orr stated that the req uest is fo r a nothe r parcel.
Chairman Sim s stated that the parce l is the same one that came before the committee unde r the prior
administration.
Ms. Orr said she does not be lieve the parcel is the same parcel. She stated that the Harvey portion is
undergoing env ironme nta l clean up and plans a re to market the Dixmoor portion.
Randy Kemmer opined that the fin al dec ision is up to the County Board.
Commissioner Butler commented that the item was first presented in October, which should have been
enough ti me for the two municipa lities to reach a n agreement a nd a letter to be sent to the comm ittee.
Ms. Orr stated that she was never asked fo r a letter until last Friday.
Commissioner Butler asked if the County knew the parcel straddled two mu nicipalities?
Attorney O rr responded that she was recently made aware that the parcel was in more than one
mun icipality.
Commiss ioner Gos lin asked if the parcel is located in one m un icipality, would the comm ittee support the
request?
C ha irman S ims stated that in order to respond to Commiss io ner Gos lin's question, one should know the
history of the Wyma n and Go rdon parce l o f land . She stated that the Wy ma n and Gordon property was
torn down due to a brownfie ld, it was believed that the entire factory was located in Harvey but upon
further examinatio n, it was fou nd that there were parce ls also in D ixmoor. C ha irman Sims conc luded by
stating that this is a decision that the County Board has to make with an opinion fro m the State's Attorney.
Assistant State' s Attorney Kemmer suggested that if the request for a No Cash Bid for the Village of
Dix moor is approved, the Village of D ixmoor wo uld also own th e parcel located in the C ity of Harvey.
A nd, if the Village of Dixmoor voluntarily agrees to deed the parcel to the City of Harvey beforehand, it
may be sufficient to relieve any obj ections by the C ity of Harvey.
Attorney Kathy O rr stated that she would prepare an agreement between the two munic ipalities that once
the pa rcel is acquired by the Village of Dixmoor a ny portion of PIN 29- 07-208-005 fal ling within the C ity
o f Harvey shall be conveyed to the City of Harvey .

335

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 18, 2001

Fredda Berman stated that normally a parcel would not straddle the boundary of a municipality which
makes this is a historical incident. She stated that a possible explanatio n for the anomaly is when the City
of Harvey and the Village of Dixmoor were created this PIN number existed. She said the boundary was
drawn when the number system came into existence in the l 950's and the fact that the parcel straddled the
line was not caught. However, the office is now in the process of dividing the parcel so that two new
PINS will be created with one falling completely and wholly within the Village of Dixmoor and the other
falling completely and wholly within the City of Harvey. Ms. Berman concluded by stating that the work
is in process but she cannot say exactly which tax year will be affected.
Attorney Orr asked if a portion of the parcel is located in the C ity of Harvey, will the Village of Dixmoor
convey it to the C ity of Harvey.
Randy Kemmer stated that he does not believe that the Village of Dixmoor should or can have a parcel in
the City of Harvey and ne ither should the City of Harvey have a claim on property within the Village of
Dixmoor.
Commissioner Goslin asked if the City of Harvey did not want the parcel, wou ld the County still need the
letter?
Randy Kemmer stated that the re should be an agreement between the two municipalities.

Commissioner Goslin, seconded by Commissioner Butler moved to approve Communication No.
247034 contingent upon receiving a letter from the City of Harvey before the County Board
Meeting of 12/18/01. The motion carried. (T he referenced document is on file in the Office of the
County Clerk.)

VILLAGE OF BREMEN TOWNSHIP (NO CASH BID REQUEST). Transmitting a
Communication from Deborah Sims, Chairman, Finance Tax Delinquency Subcomm ittee,
submitting a request dated, November 29, 200 I from Judd M. Harris, Attorney.
The Township of Bremen is requesting tax certificates from the No Cash Bid Program for the
tax delinquent properties in the submitted list. The City of Blue Is land is actively seeking to
annex this property. We believe that the subject property is eligible for the No Cash Bid
Program, as the pin numbers appear on the 200 1 Scavenger Sale list. In the event that any of
this property is ine ligible, we will withdraw our bid on that property.
This property will be used for a development project of single-family homes, in a partnership
between the Village of Bremen, the C ity of Blue Js land, and J&T Homes LLC. This project
will be an extension of the California Gardens development. The current development will
be of the same quality and will be a positive addition to the City of Blue Island. In addition,
John Davis, Pres ident of Davis Development Corporation, will assume the cost of any
infrastructure relating to water and sewer, so that these costs will not burden the taxpayers.
Neither John Davis nor J&T Homes LLC. has ever owned or had any interest in the property
they are now seeking to obtain .
Submitted is a copy of the resolution in which the Village of Bremen formally requests the
No Cash Bid for these parcels. Also included are the Sidwell maps and photographs of the
parcels. Documentation attesting to the capacity of Davis to complete the development w ill
be forthcoming, as a supplement to this application. Also, current title searches will be
submitted within approximately one week to supplement the municipal No Cash Bid
application package. Judd M. Harris, Esq. has been retained by the applicant to file petitions
for tax deeds for the parcels.

PERMANENT INDEX NUMBERS
*Referred to the committee on Finance Tax Deli nquency Subcommittee on 12/4/01
Chairman Sims asked for a representative from the Village of Bremen to explain the request.
Jodi Cash, working with the attorney from the Village of Bremen, stated that there are over one hundred
I 00 PIN numbers under the request. Ms. Cash commented that because the scavenger sale will soon take
place, not all the title searches have been completed. She said the Village of Bremen is seeking the
approval of the request contingent upon satisfactory completion of the title searches by the County Board
meeting of December 18, 200 I.
Commissioner Butler said he is bothe red when municipalities say they do not have enough time to do
their due diligence and then appear before the committee asking approval of those items.
Chairman Sims stated that a scavenger sale will be held soon and a lot of the municipalities are bring ing
forward parcels and PfNS that they wou ld like to acquire either before the scavenger sale or purchase
over the counter before someone else acquires them.
Commissioner Butler stated that the process might need to be changed. He further said that the
commissioners shou ld have more time to review No Cash Bid requests before they are approved.

340

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 18, 2001

Chairman Sims responded that during the departmental review process, a certified package is requested in
order to eliminate PINS that should not be approved or residential properties.

Randy Kemmer stated that 99.99 percent of the No Cash Bids are not residential properties .

Commissioner Butler said that the county should work on changing the process.

Jackie Harder res ponded stated that the Department of Planning and Development indicates that the
Department only received ten (I 0) of the 132 title reports for the properties. She further stated that when
there is a certified application for the scavenger sale, each application is examined for completeness . Ms.
Harder also noted for the reco rd that the Department examined the parcels and found that they are vaca nt.

Commissioner Butler asked if the process can be changed and how difficult would it be?

Jackie Harder responded that the County works with municipalities to try to give them an opportunity to
bring economic development into their area. She sa id there is a very short period of time to identify
parcels that the municipality may want to acquire, once a scavenger sale is published . Ms. Harder further
stated that the certification on the parcels is a safety net for the County. T he certification affirms that any
parcel bid in error or that is not eligible will be handled by the municipality.

Commissioner Butler, seconded by Commissioner Goslin moved to approve Communication No.
248199 contingent upon receiving title searches on all requested PINS before the County Board
Meeting of 12/18/01. The motion carried. (The referenced documents are on file in the Office of
the County Clerk.)

administering a Mortgage Credit Certificate Progra m for suburban Cook County by December 31, 200 I

the pem1anent loss of $3, 193,312.50 to the County unless the bond cap is transferred to IHDA for the
stated purpose.
The Mortgage Credit Certificate (MCC) program allows first-time home buyers a federal income tax
credit of 25% to 50% (up to $2,000.00) of their mortgage interest a direct federa l income tax credit every
year. A tax credit is a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the tax due, not just a deduction from gross income.
A MCC ho lder is a llowed to take tax credit each year, so long as the holder continues to live in the home
for which the MCC was issued .
The MCC program expands home ownership in coordination with the HOME Investment Partnership
Program activities.
The Jllino is Housing Development Authority has administered the County's MCC program since 1994 no
