 III. Action Items (continued)
C. Contracts and Procurement Items (Attachment #2)
Charles Jones, Director of Strategic Sourcing and Supply Chain Management, provided an overview of the requests
presented for the Committee’s consideration. The following individuals provided additional information on the
requests: Dr. John Jay Shannon, Chief Executive Officer; Debra Carey, Chief Operating Officer, Ambulatory Services
and Interim Chief Operating Officer, Hospital Based Services; and Steven Glass, Executive Director of Managed Care.
The Committee reviewed and discussed the requests.
Dr. Shannon provided additional information regarding request number 10. He stated that this is an early exploration
that CCHHS is doing with Sinai to see whether there are opportunities and any ability for the organizations to find
better ways to provide services and improve the quality of care across the gamut of different services, since there is
such overlap in patient populations and communities served. They will look at the needs of the communities served,
and identify strengths and opportunities that the organizations have to improve referrals and access to care. They will
be looking at different service lines, where there are possibilities of complementarity of services and individual service
lines, including, for example, some of the work being done in behavioral health. He added that Sinai is investing in
this with their own money, as well.
With regard to request number 13, Chairman Estrada noted for the record that he used to serve on the Board of
Trustees of the University of Illinois; as of yesterday, he is no longer a Trustee, so he will abstain on that item. In the
future, he will no longer need to abstain on those types of matters.
Regarding request number 16, Chairman Estrada referenced a previous offer he made to introduce discussions between
CCHHS and representatives at the University of Illinois regarding potential opportunities to partner with them to
identify technologists; as it is also a world-class provider of physicists, he offered to include that as a topic to explore.
Director Richardson-Lowry, seconded by Chairman Estrada, moved the approval of
request numbers 1 through 25, subject to completion of review by Contract
Compliance, where appropriate. THE MOTION CARRIED.
Chairman Estrada abstained and voted PRESENT on request number 13.

D. Any items listed under Sections III and IV

E. Proposed Transfer of Funds (Attachment #3)
Ekerete Akpan, Chief Financial Officer, presented the item for the Committee’s consideration. The Committee
reviewed and discussed the request.
Director Richardson-Lowry, seconded by Chairman Estrada, moved the approval of
the proposed Transfer of Funds. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

 IV. Recommendations, Discussion / Information Items
A. Report from Supply Chain Management
• Overview of Procurement (Attachment #4)
• Report of emergency purchases
Mr. Jones presented the Overview of Procurement. The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
During the discussion of slide 8, regarding sole source methodology, Dr. Shannon noted that, although better
controls have been developed under Mr. Jones’ leadership that will lead to a reduction in sole source contracts, the
exception to that general direction relates to the procurement of certain medications. The Board will likely
continue to see increases in that area, because for some designer medications and the precision therapies involved,
there is only going to be one source or manufacturer.
During the discussion of the information on slide 10 regarding contract requirements, Dr. Shannon clarified the
differences between Contract Compliance and Corporate Compliance. Contract Compliance is the County’s office
that looks particularly at the Minority and Women-Owned Business Enterprise (M/WBE) aspect. He asked Cathy
Bodnar, Chief Corporate Compliance and Privacy Officer, to provide an overview of the Office of Corporate
Compliance’s role in this process. Ms. Bodnar stated that she and her staff look at specific sections of the contract
– the sections on Corporate Compliance and regarding business associate agreements - if there are inquiries or
redlines to those sections, that comes to her. Mr. Jones added that, for those contracts that are over $1 million, they
are sent to the State’s Attorney’s Office for review as to form.
During the discussion of slide 12, regarding M/WBE goals for professional services, Chairman Estrada inquired as
to the reason for the combination of the overall goal of 35%, as indicated on the slide. Jeff McCutchan, Interim
General Counsel, stated that it relates to a different concept within the County’s Ordinance. It is an aspirational
goal that the County will award a total of 35% of all of their professional services contracts over the course of the
year to M/WBEs. In other words, it is not a 35% requirement specific to a single contract; every single contract
still has to meet the 25% MBE and 10% WBE goals.
Further discussion took place on the subject of M/WBE certification and provisions that disqualify some minorityowned companies from being certified as an MBE. Maleya Edwards, Contract Compliance Officer, Cook
County’s Office of Contract Compliance, stated that her office will only accept M/WBE certification from the City
of Chicago and Cook County. If the business owner’s personal net worth exceeds $2 million, the company does
not qualify for certification as an MBE. They may bid for County contracts, but not as an MBE.

V.

Report from the Chief Financial Officer
• Report
• Metrics
Chairman Estrada indicated that a report on Vizient was planned for this meeting, but more work needs to be done
before it is ready for presentation, so it was postponed. Draft financials are not yet ready, but he expects to have
them in time for the full Board Meeting next week. Staff are trying to close out the fiscal year, and are trying to
make sure they have the most accurate numbers as possible. Additionally, the administration is closing out the
year with one financial system, and starting the new year out on a new one, so they want to make sure the data is
being transferred correctly.

 V.

Report from the Chief Financial Officer (continued)
Dr. Shannon stated that he appreciates the Committee’s patience and tolerance as the administration moves toward
a new phase for financial reporting. With the approval of the Board and Committee Chairs, the Committee is
moving to a process that should serve everyone better, which is to have a one (1) month lag in when the Committee
sees financials. In the past, because of timing issues, staff would receive a month’s performance and literally have
to present this to the Committee only a few days later. The lag should provide for much better fidelity and insight
into financial performance; he noted that this will mimic the process that goes on at the County Board with the
overall County finances. Secondly, he would like to move towards getting to a point of sharing this at the Finance
level in an informational way each month, but actually spend more time looking at the finances perhaps on a
quarterly basis, where it makes more sense. On those off-months, when the Committee is not doing a quarterly
review, this would provide an opportunity to have a strategic conversation with the Board that he believes will have
more value. Those are the developments and modifications he’d like to make in the coming year, with the
Committee and Board’s approval. Chairman Estrada concurred; he added that he would also like to do a deep dive
on the budget for the new Directors in the near future.

criteria for another procurement method.
Small Procurements
Procurements of the same or similar supplies, goods, equipment or services
in an aggregate amount from the same vendor of less than $5,000 in the
same fiscal year does not require a formal competitive method.
Requests for Qualifications or Requests for Proposals
The system director may determine that it is in the best interest of the
system to make a purchase by a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) or Request
for Proposals (RFP) because such purchase is not readily adaptable to bid.

 Procurement Methodologies
Request for Information; Value Analysis
Requests for Information may be used to ascertain available options for
consideration in determining an appropriate method of procurement.

identify cost effective options in advance of a purchase or procurement.

Purchases may be made pursuant to the system’s membership in a purchasing
consortium for, at least in part, the purpose of obtaining advantageous pricing
and other efficiencies for the system.
Sole Source Purchases

ability possessed by a particular source OR there is only one feasible source for
the item or service.

Supply Chain Management I January 20, 2017

 Procurement Methodologies
Comparable Government Procurement
If another governmental agency has awarded a contract through a competitive method
for the purchase of the same or similar supplies, material, equipment or services, the
system SCM director, is authorized to purchase such supplies, material, equipment or
services from that vendor at a price or rate at least as favorable as that obtained by the
other government agency without engaging in a competitive procurement method.

Emergency Purchases
With the approval of the chief executive officer or his or her designee, the system SCM
director may make emergency purchases outside of the competitive processes when:
• there exists a threat to public health or public safety;
• when an immediate purchase is necessary for repairs to system property in order
to protect against further loss or damage;
• to prevent or minimize serious disruption in system services; or
• to ensure the integrity of system records.
The system SCM director is required to report the emergency and reasons for the
selection of the particular vendor to the system board finance committee within five
business days of making an emergency purchase.
