RE: Request for LPD to Provide a De?nition of the Term Construction as it Relates to

Executive Order 2016-1

 

In order to move Detroit forward we need to put Detroiters to work. I am introducing new legislation
that would codify a requirement to hire 51% bona-?de Detroit residents on publicly funded
construction proj ccts. Executive Order 2016?1 gives a de?nition of construction that does not
encompass the Wide range of construction projects that occur in this City. Therefore, I am requesting
that the Legislative Policy Division provide a de?nition which clearly de?nes the term and is inclusive

of demolition activity.

Thank you.
