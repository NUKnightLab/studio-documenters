WHEREAS, 262,240, or just under 1 in 5 children in Cook County are experiencing food insecurity; and
WHEREAS, Food insecurity is experienced in every community area in Cook County; and
WHEREAS, Hunger increases health care costs, lowers workers' productivity, harms children's
development, and diminishes children's educational performance; and
WHEREAS, Fighting hunger is a public-private partnership; in Cook County, a strong private network
exists that has provided 680,000 million people in Cook County with more than 65 million pounds of
food in Fiscal Year 2013; however, private charity cannot do it alone and a strong federal hunger relief
safety net is required; and
WHEREAS, The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is the cornerstone to the federal
food and nutrition safety net; and

BOARD AGENDA

October 23, 2013

WHEREAS, SNAP provides an important economic stimulus to Cook County’s communities, with
every dollar in SNAP support spent generating $1.79 in economic activity; and
WHEREAS, any reduction in funding of or change in policy that seeks to exclude individuals
participating in SNAP will increase the number of food-insecure people in Cook County; and
WHEREAS, threats to SNAP, exist in the current effort to reauthorize the Farm Bill; and
WHEREAS, Congress has proposed to cut up to $39 billion from SNAP in the Farm Bill, which would
result in tremendous hardship for Cook County residents; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County seeks to encourage Congress to protect SNAP and support a Farm Bill
with a strong Title IV that protects and strengthens federal food and nutrition programs.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board President and the Board of
Commissioners hereby are opposed to cuts in SNAP in the Farm Bill or the federal government’s annual
budgeting process; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That suitable copies of this resolution be delivered to the members of

of Agriculture.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
SUPPORT FOR THE CONGRESSIONAL BENEFITS FAIRNESS FOR FILIPINO VETERANS
ACT
WHEREAS, Filipino Americans have served in the U.S. Armed Forces with distinction and honor in all
wars and military engagements since World War II and as such are deserving of full veterans benefits; and
WHEREAS, in 1946, Congress passed the Rescission Act which stripped Filipino veterans of full veterans
benefits, granting them only half instead, despite their U.S. citizenship and legal permanent residency; and
WHEREAS, In 2001, Congress passed a law granting full veteran benefits to U.S. citizen or U.S. legal
permanent resident Filipino veterans who served in World War II, provided they resided in the U.S.; and
WHEREAS, Filipino veterans who served during World War II include units of the Philippine
Commonwealth Army under U.S. command, the New Philippine Scouts, and recognized guerrilla forces;
and
WHEREAS, The 2001 Congressional authorization did not stipulate a specific residency requirement yet
the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) instituted one which resulted in a determination to cut
benefits by half if it was not met; and
WHEREAS, Filipino veterans are the only group of veterans subject to the VA residency requirements
despite their valiant service to our country, receiving only half their well-earned benefits if they reside
outside the U.S. for more than 60 consecutive days or more than 183 days in a calendar year; and

 Board of Commissioners

BOARD AGENDA

October 23, 2013

WHEREAS, The benefits which are affected include service-connected disability care, dependency and
indemnity compensation, education benefits for their children, survivor benefits, and burial allowance; and
WHEREAS, Filipino veterans must submit documentation of any travel outside the country, including
copies of their passport visas and reentry permits with entrance and exit date stamps, to have their benefits
reinstated to which they are entitled yet often their case determination is pending in a backlog of cases in
the Manila Office of the VA; and
WHEREAS, U.S. citizen and legal permanent resident veterans should not be held to a stricter residency
standard in order to receive their benefits when non-veteran legal permanent residents are able to travel
outside of the country for a year before it negatively affects their immigration status; and
WHEREAS, The Benefits Fairness for Filipino Veterans Act, introduced by U.S. Senator Dick Durbin as
S. 1559 and by U.S. Representatives Luís Gutiérrez, Tammy Duckworth, William Enyart and Cheri Bustos
as H.R.3207, would do away with the restrictive VA residency requirements and instead institute a
residency requirement aligned with that for permanent legal residents of one year, affording them equal
treatment with the rest of the U.S. population.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, the Cook County Board of Commissioners joins with the
Veterans Assistance Commission of Cook County in encouraging the full Illinois Congressional
Delegation, as well as all members of the U.S. Congress, to support H.R. 3207 and S. 1559 to afford
Filipino veterans equal treatment and full benefits in honor for their service and sacrifice; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED THAT, this text be spread upon the proceedings of this Honorable Body
and that a suitable copy of this resolution be presented to each member of the Illinois Congressional
Delegation.

MD, MBA, FACHE, FACS, Chief Executive Officer, Cook County Health & Hospitals System,
PROPOSED INTERGOVERNMENTAL AGREEMENT AMENDMENT
Department: Cook County Health and Hospitals System
Other Part(ies): Cook County Board of Commissioners and Illinois Department of Healthcare and
Family Services
Request:

Approval of Seventh Amendment to Interagency Agreement

Goods or Services: This amendment provides for adjustments to the County’s quarterly transfer
payments to the state pursuant to BIPA intergovernmental transfer agreement.
Agreement Number: 2014-36-001(Tracking Number)
Agreement Period: This agreement will become effective upon execution.
Fiscal Impact: $30,000,000.00
Accounts: 491-763
Summary: The Benefits and Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 (BIPA) was passed by Congress to
counter the severe cutbacks in payments resulting from the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. Pursuant to the
intergovernmental transfer agreement, these funds are split between Cook County and the State of
Illinois.
This amendment provides for adjustments to the quarterly transfer payments.
The purpose of the amendment to this intergovernmental agreement is to allow CCHHS to reduce the first
quarter scheduled transfer back to the State General Revenue Fund (GRF) by the County by $30 million.
The intention is to help mitigate the negative financial effects of the “backlog” of CountyCare applications
at the Department of Human Services.
This amendment also reflects the increase of the third quarter scheduled transfer back to the State GRF of
$30 million.
For Federal Fiscal Year (FFY) 2014 the first quarter payment will be reduced by $30 million from
$56,200,000 to $26,200,000, the second quarter payment will remain at $93,750,000, and the third quarter
payment will be increased by $30 million from $93,750,000 to $123,750,000.
For FFY 2015, and each annual rate period thereafter, the quarterly payments will return to $56,200,000 in
the first quarter and $93,750,000 in the second and third quarters for a total of $243,700,000 per year.
This matter was approved by the Cook County Health and Hospitals System Finance Committee on
October 11, 2013. Approval of the CCHHS Finance Committee meeting minutes is expected at the
October 25, 2013 CCHHS Board meeting.
