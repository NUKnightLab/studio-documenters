Executive Director, David Cetlinski, discussed the following with the Board of Trustees:


Request by GLWA for more information from Gabriel Roeder

After a very informative phone discussion was held with GLWA on July 8, 2019, they
have put in a request for more detailed information from Gabriel Roeder on how benefit
payments were calculated and a more robust breakdown of GLWA’s projected benefit
payments.
GLWA was informed that if this work is approved by the board there would be a cost
involved that they must pay for. They agreed.
I recommend approving this work for GLWA but only after the work of the retirement
system is either finished or at a stage that won’t affect our timeline.
