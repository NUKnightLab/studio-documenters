37.
Submitting report relative to Viaduct Ownership and Maintenance Responsibilities. (The
Legislative Policy Division was requested to provide a report regarding the ownership
and responsibility of viaducts throughout the City. After some investigation of this
issue, we find no clear cut answer. It depends specific ownership and any applicable
agreements related to the particular bridge that creates the viaduct. According to
City Engineering – Department of Public Works, generally the structures that
support the bridges, i.e. the walls of the viaduct, belong to the various railroad
companies. As such the City does not have the authority to “improve”, i.e. install
lighting” on the structures without an agreement between the City and the railroad
company.) (REFERRED TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDING
