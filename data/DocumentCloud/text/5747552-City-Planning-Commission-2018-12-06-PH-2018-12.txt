NOTICE OF A PUBLIC HEARING
The City Planning Commission will hold a public hearing in the Committee of the Whole Room,
13th floor of the Coleman A. Young Municipal Center, 2 Woodward Avenue, Detroit, Michigan
48226, on
Thursday December 6, 2018 AT 5:15 PM
to consider the request of City Growth Partners LLC to amend Article XVII, District Map 4, of
the 1984 Detroit City Code Chapter 61, Zoning, and the provisions of the existing PD-H
(Planned Development District-Historic) zoning classification on properties commonly known as
3100-3136 Brush Street, 420-430 Erskine Street, 3137-3101 Beaubien Street and 427-437
Watson Street generally bounded by Erskine Street on the north, Beaubien Street on the east,
Watson Street on the south, and Brush Street on the west to establish the development known as
Brush House.
The request proposes approximately 168 residential units with ground-floor retail and
commercial space with parking on-site. The subject property is also indicated on the
accompanying map.
The subject property is located within the Brush Park Historic District. The existing zoning
district is generally defined by the zoning ordinance as follows:
PD â€“ PLANNED DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT
This district will permit planned developments throughout the City and will be particularly
useful in urban renewal areas. Such planned developments shall be substantially in accord with
the goals and objectives of the Master Plan, by having a major land use that corresponds to the
most general category of land use, which are Residential, Public/Civic/Institutional,
Retail/Service/Commercial, Manufacturing and Industrial, and Other, proposed in the Master
Plan for the area involved. Such planned developments shall provide a desirable environment for
the uses proposed and shall not be out of harmony with their general surroundings. The
regulations of the district are designed to accomplish this by permitting flexibility in overall
development while ensuring adequate safeguards and standards for public health, safety,
convenience, and general welfare and, where applicable, encouraging historic preservation.
The proposed PD modification is being considered by the City Planning Commission in
accordance with the provisions of Article XI, Division 1. of the Detroit Zoning Ordinance, Sec.
61-11-12.
You may present your views on this proposal by attending this discussion, by authorizing others
to represent you, or by writing to this office prior to the discussion, 2 Woodward Avenue, room
208, Detroit, Michigan 48226 (FAX: 313-224-4336). Because some that are affected by this

 proposal may not have been notified, it is suggested that you kindly inform your neighbors so
that they may also express their opinions if they desire.
An interpreter for the hearing impaired may be present at the meeting if requested at least 48
hours in advance. To request that an interpreter for the hearing impaired be present at the
meeting, please call 224-4946.
