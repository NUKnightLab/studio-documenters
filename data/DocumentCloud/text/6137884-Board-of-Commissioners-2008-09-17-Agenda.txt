suitable living environment.
The total project will cost $16,350,000.00 and the sources of financing will include both private and
government funding. Cook County, through the HOME program, would finance $3,750,000.00 of the
acquisition costs and maintain a junior lien on the real property. The HOME loan will be amortized over
a 40-year period at 1% interest rate. The County’s HOME program will receive annual principal and
interest payments of $113,785.22 which will be used for other HOME eligible activities.
The HOME applicant, Hispanic Housing Development Corporation (HHDC), is an Illinois Not-For-Profit
Corporation located in Chicago, Illinois, and has been in existence for over thirty years. Initially, HHDC
was founded to develop affordable housing within Latino communities throughout the City of Chicago.
However, since its inception, HHDC has grown to a 200 person organization that operates throughout
Cook County, metropolitan Chicago, and downstate Illinois. To date, HHDC has developed nearly 3,000
affordable apartments in 36 developments for families and seniors. HHDC is actively involved in
residential preservation as evidenced by its participation in the MacArthur Foundation Residential
Preservation Initiative.
I respectfully request approval of this project and that the Chief of the Bureau of Capital, Planning and
Facilities Management, or his designee, be authorized to execute, on behalf of the County of Cook, any
and all documents necessary to further the project approved herein, including, but not limited to, notes,
mortgages, agreements, letters, amendments, and modifications.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: None. Grant Funds: $3,750,000.00. (772-298 Account).

The agreement will be between the County of Cook and North West Housing Partnership (NWHP).
NWHP is an Illinois Not-For-Profit Corporation located in Schaumburg, Illinois and a long time
participant in the HOME programs of Cook County. NWHP have been partnering with Cook County for
more than ten years to administer a residential rehabilitation program to repair older homes of Cook
County. NWHP previously assisted Cook County with its home buyers program and conducted home
owner workshops and housing counseling to potential first time home buyers.
Approval of this request will enable NWHP to expand home ownership for low income residents within
Cook County. The program parameters allow up to $10,000.00 or 6% of the purchase price (whichever is
greater) per household for income qualified persons. This loan will greatly assist applicants in the down
payment and closing cost of purchasing a new home. The monies will be given in the form of a loan and
will be secured by a note, mortgage and HOME loan agreement. The funds are provided as five year zero
interest forgivable loans.
I respectfully request approval of this project and that the Chief of the Bureau of Capital, Planning and

JAMES M. HOULIHAN, Cook County Assessor
by
MICHAEL A. STONE, Chief Deputy Assessor
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with Accredited Chicago
Newspapers, Inc., Chicago, Illinois, for the publication of the state mandated publication of the proposed
assessed values for the 2009 real estate assessment in triennial townships in Cook County, within the City
of Chicago, and for the publication of state mandated publication of revisions made to the 2009 triennial
assessments in townships in Cook County, within the City of Chicago, after publication of the initial
triennial assessment publication and for the publication of the 2009 triennial assessment list in additional
newspapers for additional public notification.
Reason:

Accredited Chicago Newspapers, Inc. has published the Cook County assessment records for
many years and has been the only vendor to submit a response after numerous attempts to
utilize the bidding process on this particular annual contract. The current Illinois State Statute
(35 ILCS 200/12-20) imposes strict guidelines as to who may publish the real estate
assessment records in the triennial and non-triennial townships in Cook County, inside the
City of Chicago and, per County Ordinance, contracts such as these that require a high degree
of professional skill where the ability or fitness of the individual plays an important part for
this services. Due to the timely nature of publishing the assessment records and the above
state requirements, the Assessor’s Office deems it necessary to sole source this contract.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $987,121.00. Contract period: April 1, 2009 through March 31, 2010. (040240 Account). Requisition No. 90400003.
