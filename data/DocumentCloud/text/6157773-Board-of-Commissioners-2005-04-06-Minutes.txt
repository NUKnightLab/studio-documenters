PROPOSED RESOLUTIONS

Submitting a Proposed Resolution sponsored by
MIKE QUIGLEY, County Commissioner
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, the 2000 Census determined that minorities account for 52.4 percent of the population of
Cook County; and
WHEREAS, minority-owned businesses with paid employees constitute only 14.5 percent of the total
number of firms, 2.9 percent of total business sales and receipts, 4.8 percent of total employees, and 3.6
percent of total payroll in Cook County, according to the 1997 Economic Census; and
WHEREAS, women-owned businesses with paid employees constitute only 16 percent of the total
number of firms, 4.1 percent of total business sales and receipts, 7.7 percent of total employees, and 5.7
percent of total payroll in Cook County, according to the 1997 Economic Census; and

1087

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 6, 2005
WHEREAS, this dramatic under-representation of minorities and women in the economic life of Cook
County is a serious socioeconomic problem; and
WHEREAS, the certification of women and minority business enterprises was originally established in
order to help women and minority-owned businesses by increasing their opportunities and ending the
disparity in contracts awarded to women and minority owned businesses; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners rightly enacted the Cook County Minority
Business Enterprise/Women's Business Enterprise Ordinance to address the problem of low minority and
women-owned business participation; and
WHEREAS, abuse in the County's minority and women-owned business assistance programs harms
those minority and women-owned businesses which abide by the rules and should be the legitimate
beneficiaries of the Cook County Minority Business Enterprise/Women's Business Enterprise Ordinance;
and
WHEREAS, recently a sub-contract with a county certified minority business was found by a federal
magistrate to serve no "commercially useful" function and has exposed the County to lawsuits; and
WHEREAS, other local government bodies, such as Maricopa County, Arizona, have determined that it
is better to outsource their MBE/WBE certification programs because outsourcing is more cost effective,
non-politicized and objective.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that an outside, independent, audit of all current
MBE/WBE contracts be conducted to determine the legitimacy of their current MBE/WBE status; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the County should immediately begin the process of outsourcing
the certification of MBE/WBE contractors through a competitive bid process.

Commissioner Quigley, seconded by Commissioner Silvestri, moved that the Proposed Resolution be

granted; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Assessor annually reviews the owners' affidavit of exempt property which
states the actual use of the land; and

1088

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 6, 2005

WHEREAS, there should be a more detailed review periodically to protect Cook County taxpayers from
tax exemptions where they are no longer warranted by the manner in which the land is being used.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Assessor shall for all exempt
property at least every five years review the basis for all exemptions granted to real estate property
owners to determine if the basis for the exemption is still in existence; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Assessor shall require every five years any property owner
claiming an exemption to file certified information that proves the continuing basis for an exemption
exists;
AND BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that if the Assessor finds from the evidence presented by the
property owner that the basis for the exemption no longer exists, the Assessor shall return the property to
the tax rolls and the Assessor shall refer the evidence to the Illinois Department of Revenue and the
State's Attorney of Cook County for appropriate action.

Commissioner Suffredin, seconded by Commissioner Peraica, moved that the Proposed Resolution be

property from taxes when "actually and exclusively used for charitable or beneficent purposes, and not
leased or other wise used with a view to profit"; and
WHEREAS, not-for-profit hospitals are granted property tax exemptions as a part of this exemption
class; and
WHEREAS, not-for-profit hospitals have a special obligation to the public because they are supported by
the taxpayers and in exchange for their tax-exempt status, not-for-profit hospitals are expected to serve a
charitable mission and put the health needs of the community first; and
WHEREAS, it is important that not-for-profit hospitals that receive public benefits through tax
exemptions should return that benefit to the public through their charity care programs; and
WHEREAS, hospitals throughout Illinois will be filing reports under the Community Benefits Act of
Illinois for the first time this year; and
WHEREAS, these reports will provide information to the public about the hospitals' organizational
mission statements and will disclose the Community Benefits Plans for serving the health care needs of
the community; and
WHEREAS, other counties and government jurisdictions have already had cases that required them to
address how tax exemption status should be determined in relation to not-for-profit hospitals; and
WHEREAS, there are seventy-six hospitals in Cook County, fifty-four of which are non-profit or church
operated; and
WHEREAS, any change to the current tax exemption status would have far reaching affects on the
economic impact hospitals have in Cook County.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board, or the appointed committee
thereof, hold a hearing to determine how not-for-profit hospitals' charity care practices should impact
their tax exempt status; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Illinois Attorney General's Office, The Illinois Department of
Revenue and the Cook County Assessor's office should be available to provide information at this
hearing regarding the current status of tax-exemptions for not-for-profit hospitals in Cook County and
Illinois.

ROBERTO MALDONADO, County Commissioner
Co-Sponsored by
JOAN PATRICIA MURPHY, County Commissioner
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, over seventy non-profit hospitals benefit from property tax exemptions in Cook County and
have a moral, financial and legal responsibility to provide quality health care to the poor and uninsured;
and
WHEREAS, in June of 2005, non-profit hospitals will begin filing an annual report known as a
"Community Benefits Plan," in accordance with state law which will include the amount of charity care
and other community benefits the hospital provides; and
WHEREAS, in addition to receiving exemptions from Cook County property taxes (which according to
independent research accounts for approximately 20% of the total annual value of the hospital's
preferential tax status), non-profit hospitals in Cook County also may receive exemptions from various
federal and state income taxes, state and local sales and use taxes, tax-exempt bond financing, and taxdeductible donations; and
WHEREAS, in order to qualify for property tax exempt status in Cook County, the property utilized by
the non-profit hospital must be exclusively used in a charitable manner, as determined by the Illinois
Department of Revenue during its review of certificates of exemption; and
WHEREAS, currently, the Assessor's Office cannot calculate an approximate assessed value for tax
exempt non-profit hospitals and, therefore, there is no information to gauge the monetary savings nonprofit hospitals accrue through their tax exempt status; and
WHEREAS, unlike a typical homeowner who receives an exemption based on a percentage of the
home's assessed value through the Homeowner's Exemption, a non-profit hospital receives a total
exemption from the hospital's assessed value; and
WHEREAS, in order to fairly and accurately weigh the monetary value of the non-profit hospitals'
property tax exemption against the dollar amount given back to the community through charity care and
other community benefits, it is necessary to analyze the hospital's Community Benefits Plan along with a
report from the Assessor's Office that details each hospital's estimated assessed value and the estimated
exempt dollar amount.

1091

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 6, 2005

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners does

$600,000.00 for the acquisition of five single-family homes for thirty developmentally disabled persons.

home for eight residents. Preliminary construction costs are estimated at $360,000.00. Clearbrook plans

HOME funds and actual construction costs.

CONTRACT

Transmitting a Communication from
MICHAEL F. SHEAHAN, Sheriff of Cook County
by
TERRIE McDERMOTT, Executive Director, Department of Women's Justice Services
PATRICK M. DURKIN, Boot Camp Director, Sheriff's Impact Incarceration Department
WILLIAM WALLACE, Executive Director, Department of Community Supervision and Intervention
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with ADT Security Services,
Inc. (ADT), Oak Brook, Illinois, for project support to maintain the electronic monitoring equipment used
by the Cook County Sheriff's Office. ADT Security Services, Inc. has been the sole source provider for

Submitting a request from

Re: Cook County No Cash Bid Program Application on behalf of the Village of Palos Park

Certificate of Purchase on the following tax-delinquent parcels, located in Cook County, Illinois:

The Village of Palos Park intends to use the parcels as a park or associated recreational uses. The short
term plans are to develop the area as a new green space, including bike paths that will connect with paths
in Palos Heights and eventually Lemont. We have entered into a lease agreement with the Metropolitan
Water Reclamation District for land adjacent to these parcels, which would enhance the land available for
this purpose. The long term goals are to develop a multi-museum exhibition facility to be used by some
or all of the major museums in Chicago. By doing so, the Village of Palos Park believes that this use will
serve as an educational, recreational and cultural facility to serve its own residents, residents of Southwest
Cook County and hopefully beyond.
As part of the application for no cash bid parcels, the following has been submitted:
1.

A certified copy of a Resolution authorizing a no cash bid on the above-named parcels, which
includes a statement of benefits for our municipality and affirmation that legal counsel has been
retained and that all legal and other costs will be borne by the Village of Palos Park; and

2.

Four tract searches and name judgment searches of the owner of record of each parcel; and

3.

A copy of the Sidwell Map with the parcels marked; and

4.

Photographs of the above-named parcels.

There is no third party requestor involved with this no cash bid.

Commissioner Sims, seconded by Commissioner Hansen, moved that the communication be referred to
the Tax Delinquency Subcommittee (Comm. No. 270502). The motion carried unanimously.

WHEREAS, the Tinley Park Mental Health Center ("Tinley Park MHC") in Tinley Park, Illinois
provides a safe and secure treatment setting for mentally ill individuals, including those who have no
insurance or who have exhausted their mental health coverage, for the south suburbs in Cook County, as
well as the City of Chicago; and
WHEREAS, shuttering Tinley Park MHC would dismantle a vital community resource that has taken
decades to develop, providing a well-staffed inpatient treatment center with professional and
paraprofessionals specially trained to serve patients suffering from very severe mental illness as well as
planning which links patients to community outpatient resources; and
WHEREAS, last year, there were more than 2,000 admissions to Tinley Park MHC, a clear indication of
the great need for its services, and the demand for services at the center is increasing with the number of
patients seeking treatment rising by more than 10% over the last two years; and
WHEREAS, there are no comparable alternatives to provide care in the south suburban area and services
at community mental health centers are largely structured to serve individuals who are not in acute crisis
(are not violent, suicidal, or exhibiting extreme behaviors) and without a strong, secure treatment facility,
too many individuals with mental illness are often lost to homelessness, further burdening municipal and
law enforcement authorities; and
WHEREAS, Tinley Park MHC employs more than 300 people in our region, including doctors, nurses
and other professionals and its workers receive fair wages, good benefits and workplace rights; and
WHEREAS, current plans call for stopping Chicago residents from being admitted to Tinley Park MHC
in mid-May; and

closure of Tinley Park Mental Health Center and urges Governor Blagojevich to reconsider his proposal

WHEREAS, the federal government continues to look for ways to contain costs as the national debt
rises; and
WHEREAS, the President drafted a budget for Federal Fiscal Year 2006 that proposed to cut Medicaid
by $65 billion; and
WHEREAS, the President's budget seeks to cut Medicaid through severely limiting or eliminating the
ways in which local governments can assist states in drawing on federal dollars to support the growing
and uninsured populations; and
WHEREAS, since the inception of the Medicaid program, federal law has permitted states to use local
finds as part of the required non-federal share of Medicaid funding; and

1282

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 6, 2005

WHEREAS, the Cook County Bureau of Health Services provides access to a full continuum of
comprehensive health services for the medically underserved; and
WHEREAS, safety net hospitals, including those of the Cook County Bureau of Health Services, and
private hospitals with high numbers of Medicaid patients rely heavily on the dollars generated to the State
of Illinois and to Cook County, through an intergovernmental transfer, a legitimate way in which the State
and Cook County have substantially funded the Medicaid program for almost fifteen years; and
WHEREAS, the Administration's budget proposal calls for reductions in the program to be made
through the limitation or elimination of intergovernmental transfers; and
WHEREAS, Cook County and its Bureau of Health Services Stroger Hospital of Cook County continue
to be legally responsible for the growing uninsured, underinsured, Medicaid and the generally
underserved populations within the State of Illinois; and
WHEREAS, these safety net facilities would be unfairly affected by the federally proposed cutbacks.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that President John H. Stroger, Jr., and the Cook County
Board of Commissioners commend and support Congress in its recent vote in the United States Senate, to
strike proposed budget cuts from the Senate Budget Resolution and the establishment of a Medicaid
Commission that will review the overall program and make recommendations to the Administration and
Congress for reform; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that we further call on members of the Illinois delegation, Congress
and the Administration, that as they undertake this next process to review Medicaid, that they work jointly
with Cook County and the other local governments and safety net providers to develop and recommend
needed changes; such changes must take into account the strong need to protect safety net hospitals, who,
not only serve the underserved and indigent, but who provide services that we all rely on trauma care,
emergency care, neo-natal care and other specialty children's services and burn services to name a few.

WHEREAS, Almighty God in His infinite wisdom has called Pope John Paul II from our midst; and

Parkinson's disease and advanced age, the Pope's faith never wavered and he quickly became the
embodiment of dignity, courage and unrelenting faith; and
WHEREAS, as a man who was himself very familiar with the pain of oppressive communist rule, people
around the world were moved by the Pope's conviction relative to the concepts of freedom and justice
when, on Christmas eve in 1981, he lit a single candle in the window of his Vatican residence in a
showing of solidarity with suffering nations around the globe; and
WHEREAS, internationally-admired for his unending compassion and unwavering faith, the pope
demonstrated each day that, regardless of one's position in life, in the end, we all answer to God; and
WHEREAS, with Cook County having one of the largest Polish populations outside of Warsaw, Poland,
many from our Polish communities can vividly remember how they were captivated and spiritually
moved by the Pope's 1979 visit to Chicago; and
WHEREAS, with the passing of Pope John Paul II, we have lost a courageous man who overcame the
shackles of oppression to become a revered champion of fairness, freedom and the eradication of
discrimination.
