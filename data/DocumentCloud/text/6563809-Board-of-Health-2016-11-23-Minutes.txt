Legislative Updates – SB 333
Tom O’Donnell, General Counsel, provided a brief summary of the status of proposed SB 333
concerning enactment of a new statute and future regulations to regulate Construction and Demolition
Debris Temporary Processing and/or Recycling facilities. SB 333 was introduced in the State
Legislature and assigned to the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. Supporters’
testimony was taken last week. Proponent testimony was taken this week. CCBH and the County
Environmental Task Force submitted testimony supporting the bill. As a result of consultation with
CCBH, other health departments and industry, the state has submitted a Substitute Bill that was just
filed this week. The substitute bill contains revisions to the original bill in sections that were discussed
amongst the stakeholders. There are still a number of legislative sessions left this year. There is still a
