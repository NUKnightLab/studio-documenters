the Commission on Chicago Landmarks (the "Rules and Regulations"), the significant
historical or architectural features of the proposed Near North Side Multiple Property District

12, 1883, contributes to the character of the proposed Near North Side Multiple Property
District which consists of architecturally significant single-family houses, attached houses,
and small-scale flats buildings built in the 1870s through 1890s which tell the history of the
development of a high-quality residential neighborhood in one of Chicago’s oldest
neighborhoods, the Near North Side; (C) Preliminarily find that the demolition of a
contributing building or structure within a landmark district is a per se adverse effect on the
significant historical and architectural features of the district, pursuant to Article III, Section

Ordinance, preliminarily find that demolition of the subject property will adversely affect and
destroy significant historical and architectural features of the property and the proposed

must schedule and conduct a public hearing on both the proposed district designation and the
application for a demolition permit and must notify the City Council of its recommendation

and Regulations of the Commission on Chicago Landmarks (the "Rules and Regulations"),
the significant historical or architectural features of the proposed Near North Side Multiple

Preliminarily find that the subject building, a raised, two-story, attached, double house built

the character of the proposed Near North Side Multiple Property District which consists of
architecturally significant single-family houses, attached houses, and small-scale flats

Emily Barton presented the staff’s recommendation for 1730 West 18th Street that the
Commission: A. Find that, pursuant to Article III, Section G.1 of the Rules and Regulations
of the Commission (the “Rules and Regulations”), the significant historical or architectural

 features of the proposed district are preliminarily identified as all exterior elevations,

Preliminarily find that the subject building, a two-story, masonry, mixed-use building
constructed around 1920. No permit information was found to document the date of
construction, however Sanborn maps show that a portion of the building existed in 1914 and
that a front addition was added after 1914. The material and design of the front facade are
consistent with 1920s construction methods and styling. Therefore the building contributes to
the character of the proposed Pilsen District which includes excellent examples of historic
commercial and mixed-use buildings along the 18th St. corridor; and, C. Preliminarily find

se adverse effect on the significant historical and architectural features, pursuant to Article
