various percentages of market value, also known as assessment levels, and that there
exists seven (7) different assessment levels contained in such Section 74-64 of the

that:
Section 1. The above referenced recitals are hereby incorporated into this Resolution.
Section 2. The Cook County Board of Commissioners should amend the Ordinance in
