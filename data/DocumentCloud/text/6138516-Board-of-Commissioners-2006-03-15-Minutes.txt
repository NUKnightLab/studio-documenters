public places and workplaces, deems impaired respiratory function to be a disability; and
WHEREAS, there is no known safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke; and

be reduced to safe levels in businesses by high rates of ventilation; and
WHEREAS, air cleaners, which are only capable of filtering the particulate matter and odors in smoke,
do not eliminate the known toxins in secondhand smoke; and

and
WHEREAS, exposure to secondhand smoke costs the nation $5 billion in direct medical costs and $5

impact or there is a positive economic impact after the implementation of smoke-free restaurant/bar laws
and laws banning smoking in the workplace; and

Ordinance are (1) to protect the public health and welfare by prohibiting smoking in all public places and
places of employment, and (2) to guarantee the right of nonsmokers to breathe smoke-free air which shall

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 15, 2006

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED RESOLVED, by the Cook County Board
of Commissioners, that the Highway Department is hereby directed to select a capital
improvement project related to roads, parking lots, sidewalks, biking or walking paths, or
other pedestrian or vehicular facilities, for a pilot project in which rubberized asphalt
shall be used in place of conventional asphalt. Such project shall feature at least 2,000
square feet of rubberized asphalt and a similarly sized patch of conventional asphalt, to
enable comparisons. Such project shall be selected by the Highway Department within 6
months of the passage of this resolution and completed within -±± l.Lmonths of the
passage of this resolution.
BE IT FURTHER ORDAINED RESOLVED, that the Highway Department report
back to the Board no later than 3 months after completion of the project with an initial
evaluation of the performance of rubberized asphalt and quarterly reports thereafter.
BE IT FURTHER ORDA:INED RESOLVED, that this Onlinaeee Resolution is

*Referred, as amended to the Committee on Roads and Bridges on December 21,
2005.
Serji Amirkhanian, Ph.D., Professor, Clemson University, made a presentation regarding rubberized
asphalt.
Commissioner Quigley inquired what percentage of tires are now being burned or shredded.
Dr. Amirkhanian replied that approximately 60% of tires are now being burned.
Commissioner Collins asked whether the initial high cost of this product is offset by long-term savings.
Dr. Amirkhanian replied in the affirmative. He stated that, in particular, rubberized asphalt lasts longer
than regular asphalt, and that it requires less maintenance. Dr. Amirkhanian further stated that he has a
report that addresses this issue and that he will share this report with any Commissioner who is interested
in it.
Chairman Hansen asked at what point in the life cycle of a given road the rubberized asphalt yields
savings.
Dr. Amirkhanian replied that this varies from project to project.
Chairman Hansen asked for an average estimate.
Dr. Amirkhanian replied that, on average, there is at least a 30% to 40% savings when rubberized asphalt
is used.
Commissioner Daley inquired whether rubberized asphalt has been used in cold-weather climates.

71

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 15, 2006

Dr. Amirkhanian replied that rubberized asphalt has been used for a number of years very successfully in
Flagstaff Arizona, where the temperature ranges from minus 20 degrees to 110 degrees. He further stated
that rubberized asphalt has been shown to work with salt and other chemicals as well.
Commissioner Silvestri inquired whether rubberized asphalt can also be used for new roads.
Dr. Amirkhanian replied in the affirmative. He added that rubberized asphalt is usually used for older,
very badly cracked roads.
Commissioner Silvestri inquired whether a road's asphalt base needs to be replaced.
Dr. Amirkhanian replied in the negative.
Commissioner Silvestri inquired whether another layer needs to be added on top of the rubberized asphalt.
Dr. Amirkhanian replied in the negative.
Commissioner Silvestri inquired whether it is preferable to remove the base if the road is severely
damaged.
Dr. Amirkhanian replied that sometimes it is best to do this, but not always.
Chairman Hansen inquired whether the amount of friction increases when rubberized asphalt is used.
Dr. Amirkhanian replied that the friction level increases from 10% to 20%.
Chairman Hansen inquired how rubberized asphalt impacts the life time of a vehicle's tire.
Dr. Amirkhanian replied that, to date, this factor is unknown.
Wally S. Kos, P.E., Superintendent of Highways, Highway Department, introduced his staff who will be
working on this project: Cedric Leer, P.E, Construction Bureau Chief, Highway Department and Leon
Tamaraz, Highway Engineer IV, Division Head, Materials and Testing, highway Department.
Superintendent Kos stated that he supports a pilot program for implementing rubberized asphalt. The
rubberized asphalt would be applied as thinly as possible to save cost. The pilots would be conducted in
the northern part of the County as well as in Chicago. He inquired whether the extensive utility work and
hand structures in the City would pose any problem in testing.
Dr. Amirkhanian replied in the negative.
Commissioner Quigley suggested that Superintendent Kos and Dr. Amirkhanian meet after the meeting to
discuss the technical aspects of utilizing rubberized asphalt for the County's roads.
Chairman Hansen inquired how many lanes will be tested.
Superintendent Kos replied that the County will be testing approximately one-and-one-half to three miles
of road, and that this road will have never been treated with rubberized asphalt, except for tiny cracks.
Chairman Hansen requested a comparison of the costs of the existing asphalt and that of rubberized
asphalt.

72

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 15, 2006

Commissioner Collins inquired whether the Highway Department has begun implementation of the pilot
program.
Superintendent Kos replied that the Highway Department has devoted some time to considering the
option.
Commissioner Quigley stated that Jim Stepp, President, Rubber Asphalt Solutions, would be meeting
with Superintendent Kos after the meeting.
Commissioner Quigley suggested that the Highway Department be given additional time in which to
implement the pilot program.
Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Suffredin, moved to amend Comm No. 274784,
deleting 12 months and inserting 18 months in its place. The motion carried.

COOK COUNTY RUBBERIZED ASPHALT PILOT PROJECT
WHEREAS, rubberized asphalt, also known as asphalt-rubber or A-R, is a blend of asphalt cement,
reclaimed tire rubber, and certain additives, in which the rubber component is at least 15 percent by
weight of the total blend; and
WHEREAS, rubberized asphalt is routinely used in paving projects in Arizona, California, and Texas,
among other states; and
WHEREAS, use of rubberized asphalt takes scrap tires out of the waste stream, alleviating the
environmental and fiscal costs of tire disposal; and
WHEREAS, every lane mile of roadway constructed with rubberized asphalt requires between 500 and
2,000 used tires; and

73

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 15, 2006

WHEREAS, repaving just five percent of the nation's roads each year with rubberized asphalt would
remove all scrap tires from the waste stream; and
WHEREAS, rubberized asphalt reduces highway noise by 60 percent compared to conventional asphalt,
according to a study conducted by Sacramento County, California; and
WHEREAS, rubberized asphalt is used successfully in cold climates, including the Sierra Nevada
mountains in California and areas in Arizona at elevations exceeding 7 ,000 feet, where winter
temperatures dip to -20 degrees Fahrenheit; and
WHEREAS, increased use of rubberized asphalt by local governments such as Cook County could have
a transformative effect on the market for paving materials, given local governments' status among the
largest purchasers of goods and services in the United States; and
WHEREAS, rubberized asphalt is more durable and therefore more economical than conventional
asphalt, with several recent studies confirming that rubberized asphalt has lower life-cycle costs; and
WHEREAS, roads built with rnbberized asphalt will last longer than conventionally-constructed roads,
reducing the frequency with which traffic is disrupted by road reconstruction projects; and
WHEREAS, a study by the Arizona Department of Transportation found that 10-year maintenance costs
for rubberized asphalt were $500 per lane-mile, compared to $1,400 per lane-mile for conventional
asphalt; and
WHEREAS, widespread use of rubberized asphalt by Cook County has the potential to save taxpayers
money by reducing spending on road construction and repair over the long term.

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED RESOLVED, by the Cook County Board
of Commissioners, that the Highway Department is hereby directed to select a capital
improvement project related to roads, parking lots, sidewalks, biking or walking paths, or

months of the passage of this resolution and completed within H ll. months of the
passage of this resolution.
BE IT FURTHER ORDA.INED RESOLVED, that the Highway Department report
back to the Board no later than 3 months after completion of the project with an initial
evaluation of the performance of rubberized asphalt and quarterly reports thereafter.
BE IT FURTHER ORDAINED RESOLVED, that this Onliaaaee Resolution is
hereby repealed 3 years after it is enacted into law.
Note: This item was also referred, as amended to the Committee on Roads and

*Referred, as amended to the Committee on Environmental Control on December
21, 2005.
Serji Amirkhanian, Ph.D., Professor, Clemson University, made a presentation regarding rubberized
asphalt.
Chairman Quigley inquired what percentage of tires are now being burned or shredded.
Dr. Amirkhanian replied that approximately 60% of tires are now being burned.
Commissioner Collins asked whether the initial high cost of this product is offset by long-term savings.
Dr. Amirkhanian replied in the affirmative. He stated that, in particular, rubberized asphalt lasts longer
than regular asphalt, and that it requires less maintenance. Dr. Amirkhanian further stated that he has a
report that addresses this issue and that he will share this report with any Commissioner who is interested
in it.
Commissioner Hansen asked at what point in the life cycle of a given road the rubberized asphalt yields
savings.
Dr. Amirkhanian replied that this varies from project to project.
Commissioner Hansen asked for an average estimate.
Dr. Amirkhanian replied that, on average, there is at least a 30% to 40% savings when rubberized asphalt
is used.

141

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 15, 2006

Commissioner Daley inquired whether rubberized asphalt has been used in cold-weather climates.
Dr. Amirkhanian replied that rubberized asphalt has been used for a number of years very successfully in
Flagstaff, Arizona, where the temperature ranges from minus 20 degrees to 110 degrees. He further
stated that rubberized asphalt has been shown to work with salt and other chemicals as well.
Vice Chairman Silvestri inquired whether rubberized asphalt can also be used for new roads.
Dr. Amirkhanian replied in the affirmative. He added that rubberized asphalt is usually used for older,
very badly cracked roads.
Vice Chairman Silvestri inquired whether a road's asphalt base needs to be replaced.
Dr. Amirkhanian replied in the negative.
Vice Chairman Silvestri inquired whether another layer needs to be added on top of the rubberized
asphalt.
Dr. Amirkhanian replied in the negative.
Vice Chairman Silvestri inquired whether it is preferable to remove the base if the road is severely
damaged.
Dr. Amirkhanian replied that sometimes it is best to do this, but not always.
Commissioner Hansen inquired whether the amount of friction increases when rubberized asphalt is used.
Dr. Amirkhanian replied that the friction level increases from 10% to 20%.
Commissioner Hansen inquired how rubberized asphalt impacts the life time of a vehicle's tire.
Dr. Amirkhanian replied that, to date, this factor is unknown.
Wally S. Kos, P.E., Superintendent of Highways, Highway Department, introduced his staff who will be
working on this project: Cedric Leer, P.E, Construction Bureau Chief, Highway Department and Leon
Tamaraz, Highway Engineer IV, Division Head, Materials and Testing, Highway Department.
Superintendent Kos stated that he supports a pilot program for implementing rubberized asphalt. The
pilots would be conducted in the northern part of the County as well as in Chicago. He inquired whether
the extensive utility work and hand structures in the City would pose any problem in testing.
Dr. Amirkhanian replied in the negative.
Chairman Quigley suggested that Superintendent Kos and Dr. Amirkhanian meet after the meeting to
discuss the technical aspects of utilizing rubberized asphalt for the County's roads.
Commissioner Hansen inquired how many lanes will be tested.
Superintendent Kos replied that the County will be testing approximately one-and-one-half to three miles
of road, and that this road will have never been treated with rubberized asphalt, except for tiny cracks.

142

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 15, 2006

Commissioner Hansen requested a comparison of the costs of the existing asphalt and that of rubberized
asphalt.
Commissioner Collins inquired whether the Highway Department has begun implementation of the pilot
program.
Superintendent Kos replied that the Highway Department has devoted some time to considering the
option.
Chairman Quigley stated that Jim Stepp, President, Rubber Asphalt Solutions, would be meeting with
Superintendent Kos after the meeting.
Chairman Quigley suggested that the Highway Department be given additional time m which to
implement the pilot program.
Vice Chairman Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Moreno, moved to amend Item No. 274785,
deleting 12 months and inserting 18 months in its place. The motion carried.
Vice Chairman Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Moreno, moved the approval of
Communication No. 274785, as amended. The motion carried.

COOK COUNTY RUBBERIZED ASPHALT PILOT PROJECT
WHEREAS, rubberized asphalt, also known as asphalt-rubber or A-R, is a blend of asphalt cement,
reclaimed tire rubber, and certain additives, in which the rubber component is at least 15 percent by
weight of the total blend; and
WHEREAS, rubberized asphalt is routinely used in paving projects in Arizona, California, and Texas,
among other states; and
WHEREAS, use of rubberized asphalt takes scrap tires out of the waste stream, alleviating the
environmental and fiscal costs of tire disposal; and

143

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 15, 2006

WHEREAS, every lane mile of roadway constructed with rubberized asphalt requires between 500 and
2,000 used tires; and
WHEREAS, repaving just five percent of the nation's roads each year with rubberized asphalt would
remove all scrap tires from the waste stream; and
WHEREAS, rubberized asphalt reduces highway noise by 60 percent compared to conventional asphalt,
according to a study conducted by Sacramento County, California; and
WHEREAS, rubberized asphalt is used successfully in cold climates, including the Sierra Nevada
mountains in California and areas in Arizona at elevations exceeding 7 ,000 feet, where winter
temperatures dip to -20 degrees Fahrenheit; and
WHEREAS, increased use of rubberized asphalt by local governments such as Cook County could have
a transformative effect on the market for paving materials, given local governments' status among the
largest purchasers of goods and services in the United States; and
WHEREAS, rubberized asphalt is more durable and therefore more economical than conventional
asphalt, with several recent studies confirming that rubberiZed asphalt has lower life-cycle costs; and
WHEREAS, roads built with rubberized asphalt will last longer than conventionally-constructed roads,
reducing the frequency with which traffic is disrupted by road reconstruction projects; and
WHEREAS, a study by the Arizona Department of Transportation found that 10-year maintenance costs
for rubberized asphalt were $500 per lane-mile, compared to $1,400 per lane-mile for conventional
asphalt; and
WHEREAS, widespread use of rubberized asphalt by Cook County has the potential to save taxpayers
money by reducing spending on road construction and repair over the long term.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDA.INED RESOLVED, by the Cook County Board of
Commissioners, that the Highway Department is hereby directed to select a capital improvement project
related to roads, parking lots, sidewalks, biking or walking paths, or other pedestrian or vehicular
facilities, for a pilot project in which rubberized asphalt shall be used in place of conventional asphalt.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 15, 2006
Dr. Martin stated that he was pleased to testify on behalf of the Cook County Clean Indoor Air Ordinance.
Second-hand smoke kills an estimated 65,000 people nationally each year; in Illinois eight people die
each day from exposure to second-hand smoke. In the United States about 90% of lung cancer deaths in
men and about 80% of lung cancer deaths in women are due to smoking. The benefits of the Cook
County Clean Indoor Air Ordinance are that fewer people will be exposed to second-hand smoke and
more people may stop smoking. The Ordinance enforces the same protection to the unincorporated
residents of Cook County that the City of Chicago and the Village of Skokie have provided for their
residents.
Commissioner Quigley, seconded by Commissioner Daley, moved the approval of Communication
No. 275837, as amended. The motion carried.

WHEREAS, in 1988, the City of Chicago enacted the "Clean Indoor Air Ordinance" that
requires all employers located within Chicago to enact a smoking policy; and
WHEREAS, on August 22, 1988, in response to the City of Chicago Ordinance, the

policy for County facilities, referred to as the "Cook County Government Smoking
Policy"; and
WHEREAS, since that time there has been new research as to the effects of secondhand
smoke; and
WHEREAS, because of increasing evidence of the dangers of secondhand smoke, the
City of Chicago has repealed its "Clean Indoor Air Ordinance" and replaced it with the
"Chicago Clean Indoor Air Ordinance of 2005," which is more stringent in regulating
smoking than its predecessor ordinance; and
WHEREAS, secondhand smoke contains over 4,000 chemical compounds, of which 200
are known poisons including carbon monoxide, arsenic, cyanide, benzene and
formaldehyde; and
WHEREAS, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency classifies secondhand smoke as

smoke cannot be reduced to safe levels in businesses by high rates of ventilation; and
WHEREAS, ASHRAE (American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air

WHEREAS, persons conducting business in any enclosed facility or any portion
thereof, owned or operated by the County ("County Facility" or "County Facilities")

WHEREAS, in response to the risks associated with smoking, the Sheriff of Cook
County has banned smoking throughout the Department of Corrections; and

CONVERTING BETHANY HOSPITAL TO A LONG - TERM HEALTH FACILITY
(PROPOSED RESOLUTION). Submitting a Proposed Resolution sponsored by Roberto
Maldonado, County Commissioner.
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, Bethany Hospital has been serving Chicago's West Side for over 85 years
as a full service community hospital; and
WHEREAS, the West Side has Chicago's largest proportion of medically needy
residents as well as the highest concentration of "working poor," people earning between
100% and 200% of the federal poverty level, who are least likely to have either public or
private health insurance; and
WHEREAS, according to the Sinai Urban Health Institute, neighborhoods in the
Bethany service area face a host of serious health challenges, including rates of asthma,
diabetes, depression, and obesity dramatically higher than the national and Chicago
averages; and
WHEREAS, despite the growing need for general acute care services in Chicago's West
Side, Advocate Health Care Network, Chicago's largest private nonprofit hospital system
and Bethany's corporate owner, recently announced plans to convert Bethany Hospital
from a general acute care facility to a long-term care facility; and
WHEREAS, Advocate's conversion plan would eliminate a wide range of health care
services including emergency, obstetrics/gynecology, intensive care, mental health, and
other crucial services for the poor and underserved West Side residents; and
WHEREAS, since the majority of Bethany's 67,000 patients lack private health
insurance, these patients will likely seek care at Cook County's Stroger Hospital, and
other area hospitals already struggling to deal with the area's large uninsured and
Medicaid populations; and
WHEREAS, prior to the conversion plan, Advocate allowed the Cook County Bureau of
Health Services to use space in Bethany Hospital free of charge to operate a walk-in
clinic that served 15,000 patients each year, and it now intends to charge Cook County
between $200,000 and $300,000 annually to use the same space; and
WHEREAS, as a religiously-sponsored, nonprofit health care provider that has long
enjoyed substantial public subsidies in the form of generous tax breaks and other benefits,
Advocate has a responsibility, both legal and moral, to continue to help meet the West
Side's health needs.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that we, the President and the Members of
the Cook County Board of Commissioners encourage Advocate Health Care Network to
follow applicable laws and regulations with regard to converting Bethany Hospital to a
long-term care facility, including obtaining all necessary permits and holding all
necessary public hearings before it discontinues any services at Bethany Hospital; and

150

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 15, 2006
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Bureau of Health Services
prepare a report assessing the potential fiscal and health impact of absorbing many of the
former patients from Bethany Hospital into our public health system as well as the fiscal
impact of operating the Bethany clinic on a rental basis, present those findings to the
Cook County Board, and make the report available to the public.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Health and Hospitals Committee hold public
hearings to determine the overall health and community impact of converting Bethany
Hospital to a long-term care facility.
*Referred to the Committee on Health and Hospitals 03/1/06.
Chairman Butler called on Daniel H. Winship, M.D., Chief, Bureau of Health Services, to address the
Committee.
Dr. Winship addressed the Committee regarding the potential impacts upon the Cook County Bureau of
Health Services and healthcare services on Chicago's Westside of the Proposed Reconfiguration of
Bethany Hospital.
Chairman Butler asked Commissioner Maldonado to read the resolve clauses of the Proposed Resolution
so that the Commissioners are aware of what they are voting on.
Commissioner Maldonado read the resolve clauses into the record.
Commissioner Maldonado, seconded by Commissioner Moreno, moved to strike BE IT FURTHER
RESOLVED, that the Health and Hospitals Committee hold public hearings to determine the
overall health and community impact of converting Bethany Hospital to a long-term care facility.
Commissioner Maldonado clarified the third resolve. He stated that the only thing that is being amended
is deleting the Jetter "s" from the word "hearings".
Chairman Butler replied that the whole paragraph should be deleted, because it is redundant. It is stated
in the previous resolve clauses.
Commissioner Maldonado stated that by adopting the language of the Proposed Resolution, the
Committee has already complied with that result.
The motion was withdrawn.
Commissioner Maldonado, seconded by Commissioner Moreno, moved the approval of
Communication No. 276235. The motion carried.
Chairman Butler asked the Secretary to the Board to call upon the registered public speakers.

THE HONORABLE ROBERTO MALDONADO, COUNTY COMMISSIONER

163

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 15, 2006
WHEREAS, Bethany Hospital has been serving Chicago's West Side for over 85 years as a full service
community hospital; and
WHEREAS, the West Side has Chicago's largest proportion of medically needy residents as well as the
highest concentration of "working poor," people earning between 100% and 200% of the federal poverty
level, who are least likely to have either public or private health insurance; and
WHEREAS, according to the Sinai Urban Health Institute, neighborhoods in the Bethany service area
face a host of serious health challenges, including rates of asthma, diabetes, depression, and obesity
dramatically higher than the national and Chicago averages; and
WHEREAS, despite the growing need for general acute care services in Chicago's West Side, Advocate
Health Care Network, Chicago's largest private nonprofit hospital system and Bethany's corporate owner,
recently announced plans to convert Bethany Hospital from a general acute care facility to a long-term
care facility; and
WHEREAS, Advocate's conversion plan would eliminate a wide range of health care services including
emergency, obstetrics/gynecology, intensive care, mental health, and other crucial services for the poor
and underserved West Side residents; and
WHEREAS, since the majority of Bethany's 67,000 patients lack private health insurance, these patients
will likely seek care at Cook County's Stroger Hospital, and other area hospitals already struggling to
deal with the area's large uninsured and Medicaid populations; and
WHEREAS, prior to the conversion plan, Advocate allowed the Cook County Bureau of Health Services
to use space in Bethany Hospital free of charge to operate a walk-in clinic that served 15,000 patients
each year, and it now intends to charge Cook County between $200,000 and $300,000 annually to use the
same space; and
WHEREAS, as a religiously-sponsored, nonprofit health care provider that has long enjoyed substantial
public subsidies in the form of generous tax breaks and other benefits, Advocate has a responsibility, both
legal and moral, to continue to help meet the West Side's health needs.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that we, the President and the Members of the Cook
County Board of Commissioners encourage Advocate Health Care Network to follow applicable laws and
regulations with regard to converting Bethany Hospital to a long-term care facility, including obtaining all
necessary permits and holding all necessary public hearings before it discontinues any services at Bethany
Hospital; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Bureau of Health Services prepare a report
assessing the potential fiscal and health impact of absorbing many of the former patients from Bethany
Hospital into our public health system as well as the fiscal impact of operating the Bethany clinic on a
rental basis, present those findings to the Cook County Board, and make the report available to the public;
and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Committee on Health and Hospitals hold public hearings to
determine the overall health and community impact of converting Bethany Hospital to a long-term care
facility.

Approved and adopted this 15th day of March 2006.

Transmitting a Communication, dated March 9, 2006 from
ROBERTO MALDONADO, County Commissioner
I am submitting the below Resolution for the March 15, 2006 Board Agenda for approval. The
Resolution memorializes the Illinois Congressional delegation to defeat the passage of H.R. 443 7, "The
Border Protection, Antiterrorism & Illegal Immigration Control Act," in the U.S. Senate. H.R. 4437
focuses only on unworkable enforcement initiatives, rather than humane legalization measures, that will
further stigmatize the more than 300,000 undocumented immigrants in Cook County.

THE HONORABLE ELIZABETH ANN DOODY GORMAN, COUNTY COMMISSIONER
WHEREAS, on December 16, 2005, the United States House of Representatives passed H.R. 443 7, "The
Border Protection, Antiterrorism & Illegal Immigration Control Act," a bill that may lead to an increase in
human rights abuses and spark an unprecedented climate of fear in immigrant communities throughout
our nation; and
WHEREAS, considered by its sponsor, U.S. Representative F. James Sensenbrenner, Jr. (R-WI 5th), and
its proponents to be a solution to our country's broken immigration system, H.R. 4437 poses serious
humanitarian as well as legal concerns portraying immigrants as a threat we need to protect ourselves
from rather than as an integral part of the community; and
WHEREAS, H.R. 4437 requires the mandatory detention of all immigrants without status until
deportation, which could result in vulnerable groups, such as children and torture survivors, being jailed
with hardened criminals; and
WHEREAS, H.R. 443 7 makes "unlawful presence" a crime and an aggravated felony for immigration
purposes, barring undocumented immigrants from any future legal status and authorizing local law
enforcement to arrest these immigrants; and
WHEREAS, H.R. 4437 denies basic due process protections to legal immigrants, refugees and asylumseekers by authorizing the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice to deny an
immigrant legal benefits for lack of good moral character based on a "discretionary finding or other
reasons"; and

176

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 15, 2006
WHEREAS, H.R. 4437 creates strong criminal penalties for any person or organization that assists
persons without documentation in the United States if the assistance is given "in reckless disregard" of
whether that person is without legal status, but does not exempt emergency situations or situations in
which a humanitarian organization provides basic needs assistance; and
WHEREAS, this punitive legislation focuses only on unworkable enforcement initiatives that further
stigmatize the United States' undocumented population of eleven million immigrants, including half a
million in Illinois, and more than 300,000 in Cook County; and
WHEREAS, it is expected that the United States Senate will consider H.R. 4437 in March of this year as
the immigration reform debate reaches a fever pitch with an onslaught of government enforcement
measures seeking to instill fear and strip immigrants of their livelihoods, homes, and families.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that we, the President and the Members of the Cook
County Board of Commissioners do hereby support comprehensive immigration reform that provides a
humanistic path to legalization and family reunification, and provides for the security of the people of the
UniLed Stales by deporting any individuals who, after due process and fair review, have b n determined
to pose a security threat to our nation.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that we memorialize the Illinois Congressional delegation to defeat the
passage of H.R. 4437 in the United States Senate, and do hereby urge the President of the United States to
veto such legislation should it win Senate approval; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a suitable copy of this Resolution be delivered to the President of
the United States, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the President of the Senate, the Majority
and Minority Leaders of the Senate, the Minority Leader of the House, and each member of the Illinois
Congressional Delegation.
