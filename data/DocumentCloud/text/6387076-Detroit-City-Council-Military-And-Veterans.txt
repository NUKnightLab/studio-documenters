request to establish an Obsolete Property Rehabilitation Act District for the
property located at 150 Bagley Street. generally located between W, Adams, Clifford

Bagley intends to renovate and repurposc the existing eighteen story. 217.300 st? building.

Re: Obsolete Property Rehabilitation District - Bagley Development Group LLC
Address: 150 Bagley
Parcel Numbers: 02000327.

Dear Mr. Cox:

The Office of the Chief Financial Officer, Office of the Assessor, has reviewed the proposed Obsolete Property Rehabilitation
District located at 150 Bagley in the Downtown area in the City of Detroit. The deveIOper, Bagley Development Group, is a
ground lessee forthe property located at .150 Bagley.

The rationale for creating Obsolete Property Rehabilitation Districts under PA 146 of 2000, as amended, is based on the
anticipation of increased market value upon completion of new construction and /or significant rehabilitation of existing
commercial property and commercial housing property Normal repair and maintenance are not assessed and do not
necessarily generate additional market value.

Bagley Development Group LLC intends to renovate and repurpose the 18 story building into 148 one and two bedroom
units at market rate (20% of which will be affordable) on floors 2 to 18 and 10,500 square feet of commercial, retail and
restaurant on the first ground floor. The developer is requesting an Obsolete Property Rehabilitation district for the ground
floor and basement and a Neighborhood Enterprise Zone district, in a separate request, for the apartment units. The 18
story United Artist theater/office building currently vacant and in needed of significant repair contains 226,008 square feet
of building area and was built in 1927 on .690 acres of land. Rehabilitation will include interior renovations, new mechanical
systems, windows, flooring and will meet all requirements for restoring historical structures.

This property meets the criteria set forth under PA 146 of 2000, as amended It applies to blighted, functionally obsolete
and contaminated properties. "Rehabilitation," meaning that changes to qualified facilities that are required to restore or
modify the property, together with all appurtenances, to an economically efficient condition. Rehabilitation also includes
major renovation and modification including, but not necessarily limited to, the improvement offloor loads, correction of
deficient or excessive height, new or improved fixed building equipment, including heating, ventilation, and lighting,
reducing multistory facilities to 1 or 2 stories, adding additional stories to a facility or adding additional space on the same
floor level not to exceed 100% of the existing floor space on that floor level, improved structural support including
foundations, improved roof structure and cover, floor replacement, improved wall placement, improved exterior and
interior appearance of buildings, and other physical changes required to restore or change the obsolete property to an
economically efficient condition.

A field investigation indicated that the proposed Obsolete Property Rehabilitation District located at 150 Bagley is eligible as
it pertains to the Obsolete Property Rehabilitation Act under A. 146 of 2000, as amended.

RE: Master Plan Interpretation for Obsolete Property District (PA 146) at 150 Bagley Street
DATE: March 21, 2019

CC: Maurice Cox, Director, Planning and Development

In order to ensure that the creation of an Obsolete Property District is in conformance with the City?s
Master Plan of Policies and will have the reasonable likelihood to increase commercial activity; create,
retain or prevent a loss of employment; revitalize an urban area; or increase the number of residents in
a community, pursuant to State of Michigan, Public Act 146 of 2000 (section 125.2788), the Planning and
Development Department submits the following interpretation. The Petitioner ofthis project is Bagley

Development Group LLC.

Location and Project Proposal: Subject site is located at 150 Bagley Street. The project proposes to
renovate and repurpose the existing eighteen story, 217,300 square feet building, commonly known as
the United Artist Building, into 148 one and two-bedroom market rate apartment units (20% affordable)
totaling approximately 206,800 square feet on floors 2-18 and 10,500 square feet of
commercial/retail/restaurant space on the ground floor.

Existing Site Information: The existing structure is vacant and requires significant rehabilitation. The
proposed rehabilitation includes renovation ofthe building to standards required for historic structures

on the National Register of Historic Places.

Master Plan Interpretation
The subject site area is designated Mixed Residential-Commercial (MRC). Mixed Residential-

Commercial areas consist primarily of high density housing developed compatibly with commercial
and/or institutional uses. This classification is well suited to areas proximal to existing centers of major
commercial activity, major thoroughfares, transportation nodes, or gateways into the city.?

The following policies of the Central Business District neighborhood describe the following

recommendations:
. Policy 11.1 Give high priority to the preservation of historic buildings, especially the
restoration, rehabilitation, and reuse of building facades
I Policy 11.2 Ensure aesthetic compatibility between new and existing structures and sites
I Policy 15.1 Develop design guidelines to promote linkages among and to the various Central
Business District business and entertainment districts

The proposed development conforms to the Future General Land Use characteristics of the
area.
