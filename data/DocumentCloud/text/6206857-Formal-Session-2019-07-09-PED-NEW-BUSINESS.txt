HONORABLE DETROIT CITY COUNCIL

RE: Establishing Priorities and Threshold Criteria for the 2020-21 Community Development
Block Grant/Neighborhood Opportunity Fund Program

On July 23, 2019 Your Honorable Body is scheduled to receive an update and presentation from the
Housing and Revitalization Department regarding their proposed timeline for the 2020-2021
OF process. The first two proposal writing workshops (there may be more) have been
tentatively scheduled for a Wednesday and Saturday in August ahead of the RFP being released on
August 30th. Similarly to the last two years a best practices forum was held on Monday, June 10,
2019. This forum was advertised via the public access channels as well as email distribution
networks through your respective offices.

For several years the Detroit City Council has held Committee of the Whole strategy sessions on
Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), where it has been recommended that the City
Council adopt funding priorities for the pending Community Development Block
Grant/Neighborhood Opportunity Fund funding cycles in anticipation of a 7.5% to
10% reduction in funding. However, in 2019?2020 as with 2018-2019 an overall increase in funding
was realized, supplemented by additional funds through a Section 108 loan defeasance payment.
Since the process of2015-16 the City Council and the Administration have elected to
adopt the same set of priorities as you have done for the past four ?lnding cycles.

AS in years past, it has been recommended that Council take the necessary actions to formally adopt
the joint threshold criteria that City Planning Commission staff and the Housing and Revitalization
staff are required to use in reviewing the OF proposals for the applicable ?scal year.

Priorities
As it relates to ouncil's past priorities the actual funding amounts from the 2019?20 
review are listed below:

-Home Repair $5,561,791
-Homeless/Public Service $2,475,417
-Economic Development $1,000,000
-Public Facility Rehabilitation $400,000

- Summer Jobs Program]

SESC Training Program (NRSA) $2,980,874

- Public Service
. Education $1,175,649

I Seniors $419,042

 

I Recreation $362,535
I Health $362,535
I Public Safety $121014
P.S. Total $2,442,775

If council is desirous of funding a public service activity which historically have not been considered,
please indicate what that activity is on the attached survey. Given the time frame available, and the
impact of the Neighborhood Revitalization Strategy Areas on Public Service ?nding, it may be best
to simply identify the priorities.

Threshold Criteria

Below, please ?nd the twelve (12) threshold criteria recommended for implementation during the
2020-2021 proposal review process. The list is essentially identical to the threshold
criteria adopted by Your Honorable Body the last three years.
