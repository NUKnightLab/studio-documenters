p. 3

 Brent Lewandowski, Senior Benefits Manager, reported that PA 99-0578 recently amended
the Illinois Pension Code to permit the Board to approve duty disability benefits without a
recommendation of disability from the County Physician so long as the member was
compensated for the duty injury under the Illinois Workers’ Compensation Act for the period
of time in which duty disability benefits were requested. He stated that the first two cases that
could be approved under PA 99-0578 were presented for the Board’s consideration. It was
expected that any additional cases that could be approved under this amendment would be
presented with the other disability cases for standard approvals.
It was moved by Trustee McFadden and seconded by Trustee Fitzgerald that the Board
approve the duty disability benefits requested by members with Office #109952 and Office #
141637, each having received compensation for their injuries under the Illinois Workers’
Compensation Act and each having provided proof of their disabilities as required by PA 990578.

b. Ordinary Disability ARCP Repayment
Gary LeDonne, Senior Policy Advisor, stated that a member with Office #145302 who
received an Alternative Retirement Cancellation Payment (“ARCP”) had applied to receive
ordinary disability benefits. Mr. LeDonne explained that under ARCP, the Pension Code
was amended by prior county administration so that members, who withdrew from service in
2007 and applied for a refund, would also be eligible for a 50% bonus. If the member
returned to service the bonus, plus 6% interest, had to first be repaid to the Fund. The Fund
had received a legal opinion from the State’s Attorney that it could not prohibit the return to
service of an ARCP recipient, but the Fund could collect the amounts due. Mr. LeDonne
informed the Board that the Fund had notified ARCP members who returned to service of
their obligations to repay the bonuses, plus interest, to the pensin fund. Some ARCP
members voluntarily repaid the bonuses due, including the accrued interest. If an ARCP
member withdrew from County service after subsequent re-employment, the Fund has
retained from the refund any amounts due under ARCP. Mr. LeDonne also noted that
beginning in 2016 with the annual notice of member’s contributions, ARCP members were
notified of any amounts owed to the Fund. The Fund was seeking direction about
establishing eligibility for the disability benefit for a member who had not repaid the ARCP
bonus and collection options.
Mary Pat Burns, Fund legal counsel, stated that the Fund should continue to notify ARCP
members of the amounts due and to determine if the amounts owed are collectible. She
added that the Fund could enter agreements to set a payment plan to satisfy the members’
obligations. Mr. LeDonne added that the Fund was owed approximately $1.2 million in
aggregate for ARCP bonuses, including accrued interest. The trustees discussed the need to

 collect the ARCP payments and requested that Fund staff prepare a plan presenting options
for collection for the Board to consider.
It was moved by Trustee Fitzgerald and seconded by Trustee Kourkulis that the Board defer
any decision about whether the member identified by Office #145302 is eligible for ordinary
disability benefits as presented and whether such benefits would be offset by any ARCP
payments, plus interest, the member might owe to the Fund.

6. Consideration of August 30, 2016 Health Benefits Committee Recommendation
Brenda Deming, Director of Health Benefits, stated that the Health Benefits Committee met on
August 30, 2016, and reviewed the 2017 expected plan expenses and made a recommendation to the
Board about the contributions that would be due from the members and the Fund for health benefits.
Ms. Deming reported that the plan’s 2017 expenses are expected to be a 10% increase over the 2016
projected expenses. Total annual plan cost for 2017 is projected to be $95,500,016 based on current
enrollment counts. The expense to the Fund is projected to be $53,416,248, reduced $47,369,648
with the implementation of the new Employer Group Waiver Plan (“EGWP”) subsidies, which are
valued at $6,046,600. She also presented the proposed Fund subsidy for 2017 and corresponding
member premiums.
The trustees discussed the recommendations. The Board asked that the monthly administrative fee
due to UnitedHealthcare be shown separately from other amounts due to them when the staff
presents the Fund’s monthly expenditures for approval.
It was moved by Trustee Goode and seconded by Trustee Fitzgerald that the Board approve the
recommendation made by the Health Benefits Committee at their meeting on August 30, 2016, to
maintain the subsidy for member health benefits at 52% for annuitants and 67% for survivors for the
Choice Plan with Medicare, the Choice Plan Non-Medicare and the Choice Plus Plan with Medicare
for 2017.

7. Legal Report
a. In the Matter of Regina Taylor – Felony Conviction/Refund
Margaret M. Fahrenbach, Legal Advisor, stated that Regina Taylor, an annuitant, had been
sentenced to a felony conviction on July 12, 2016 relating to her employment at the Cook
County Recorder of Deeds. At the meeting on August 4, 2016, the Board suspended her annuity
benefits and notified Ms. Taylor that it would make a final determination about whether her
annuity benefits would be revoked at the meeting on September 1, 2016. Ms. Fahrenbach stated
that Ms. Taylor applied for a refund on August 23, 2016. By accepting a refund a member
forfeits all rights to an annuity benefit.
It was moved by Trustee McFadden and seconded by Trustee Goode that the Board find that
Regina Taylor was not eligible for annuity benefits pursuant to Section 9-235 of the Illinois
Pension Code and that she was eligible for a refund of her remaining contributions.

8. Legislative Update
a. Spring Legislative Session Update
The Executive Director presented a summary of the Fund’s proposed legislation for the
General Assembly’s spring session. She stated that all the proposed technical changes
approved by the Board had been enacted by PA 99-0578. She reported that SB 2819 which
would specifically allow Cook County to provide monies from sources other than the
property tax bill was approved by the legislature but was vetoed by the Governor who
expressed concerns about restrictions on use of additional resources and insufficiently
addressed under funding.
It was discussed that the current Intergovernmental Agreement (“IGA”) between the Fund
and the County which transferred scheduled proceeds received due to the increase in County
retail sales tax to the Fund, was effective only for 2016 and inquired about the status of 2017
proposal. Ms. Burns reported that she and the Executive Director had proposed revisions to
SB 2819 and met with County representatives to discuss the changes but no agreement had
yet been reached. The revisions suggested to SB 2819 by the Fund were not found acceptable
by the County’s representatives.
