INVOCATION
Chairman Woronchak called upon Commissioner Killeen for the introduction of Father
Duane R. Novelly of St. Matthew Catholic Church, who gave the following invocation:
“Oh Lord, our God, in these somber days, fill our lives with the warmth and beauty that
is yours and your creation. Cleanse and refresh us with new life. May the work we do be at a
slower pace so that we may know and see you in all we do. May what we do always be
guided by a desire to help those we serve and may our service never be directed toward selfreward, but dedicated to the people who have placed their trust and faith in us to work for their
well-being. Oh Lord, we ask you to bless the work these Commissioners do here today. Give
us courage to believe in the highest values, wisdom to make good and right decisions, faith to
trust in you and each other, patience to listen with an open heart and love to serve with a
dignity that raises up all the people of Wayne County. May the work of these Commissioners
be blessed and may everything we do begin with your inspiration. May we continue with your
help so that all our prayers and good works may begin in you and end happily to the glory and
praise of your name. And so, we call down your blessing Lord upon this meeting of
Commissioners, your servants who give of themselves for the welfare of others, may they
faithfully serve you and their neighbors and the citizens of this, Wayne County, and may the
blessing of Almighty God come upon you and keep you in the name of the Father, and of the
Son and of the Holy Spirit. AMEN. ”

million is projected in all other expenditure categories; Other Financing
