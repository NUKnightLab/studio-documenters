Recommendation

The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) recommends that the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing
Authority (CHA) authorize CHA staff to proceed with the application process for the Emmett Street Project
under the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) Rental Assistance Demonstration
(RAD) program. The RAD application for the Emmett Street Project will request that RAD Transfer of
Assistance from Julia Lathrop Homes (Lathrop Homes) be applied to 50 Project-Based Voucher (PBV) units
at the property. The RAD PBV assistance will allow for flexibility to leverage financing for property
development costs upfront and for future improvements as needs arise.
The requested action complies in all material respects with all applicable federal, state and local laws, and
Chicago Housing Authority board policies. Staff have completed all necessary due diligence to support the
submission of this initiative.

 Background and Approach

In 2012, Congress authorized the RAD program. RAD provides an opportunity for housing authorities to
utilize either project-based voucher (PBV) or project-based rental assistance (PBRA) contracts to stabilize
funding for originally up to 60,000 units of public housing nationwide; over the years, the unit cap was
raised to 455,000 units. A primary goal of RAD is to use long-term contracts to leverage private financing
for capital improvements while preserving affordability.
Receiving a RAD portfolio award in June 2015, CHA continues to progress with transitioning more than
10,000 units to Project-Based Voucher (PBV) units under the RAD program. To date, CHA has converted
more than 5,000 units to PBV subsidy. CHA plans to submit a formal RAD application to HUD for Emmett
Street that will be included as part of the larger portfolio award CHA received.
A key component of the RAD program that is applicable to the requested approval outlined herein is the
permission to transfer subsidy from one property to another. The HUD-authored RAD Notice (PIH-201232 (HA) H-2017-03, REV-3) allows for “Transfer of Assistance”, where a Public Housing Agency (PHA) may
partially or fully transfer PBV subsidy from a “Converting Project” to a “Covered Project.” Transfer of
Assistance approvals are ultimately determined by HUD.
The 924 units that once stood at Lathrop Homes will be redeveloped to include 400 on-site RAD PBV units
for CHA eligible residents after the completion of multiple construction phases. CHA is seeking to identify
replacement housing opportunities for the other 524 units on the north side of Chicago to subsidize with
RAD PBV assistance transferred from Lathrop Homes. The CHA Board of Commissioners (BOC) has
previously approved this transfer of assistance option from Lathrop Homes to several development
projects, including but not limited to Concord at Sheridan (6418 N. Sheridan), Northtown Apartments
(6800 N. Western), Independence Apartments (4022 N. Elston), and Oso Apartments (3441 W. Montrose).
By this action, CHA seeks to add the following property for transfer of assistance:

Property Profile: Emmett Street Project
•

The Emmett Street Project will be a mixed-finance, mixed-use property in the Logan Square
community area of Chicago. The redevelopment site is a City-owned parking lot directly north of
the Logan Square Blue Line station (the project is formally known as the Logan Square TOD
project). The property is currently planned to contain 4,500 square feet of ground floor
commercial space with a total of 100 residential units, including 50 RAD PBV units and 50 LIHTC
units.

•

Bickerdike Redevelopment Corporation will acquire the 41,200-square foot lot from the City of
Chicago for $1; Bickerdike will develop and own the project.

•

Post completion, Emmett Street is currently planned to contain 16 one-bedroom units; 25 twobedroom units; and 9 three-bedroom units for CHA families.

2

 •

The project development costs are currently projected to be $31 million. Low Income Housing Tax
Credits (LIHTC), Tax Increment Financing (TIF), and other layered financing resources are
anticipated to be assembled as the project’s sources of funds. A financing plan will be brought
before the Board of Commissioners at a later date, once plans are solidified.
