PROPOSED RESOLUTION

WHEREAS, the 2. 7 million voters in Cook County are divided between two administering jurisdictions,

million suburban residents registered under the aegis of the Election Division within the office of the

WHEREAS, the Cook County Clerk and the Chicago Board of Elections have jointly detennined it is in
the best interests of all voters throughout Cook County to conduct elections under a uniform system that

suburban townships; and
WHEREAS, to achieve the goal of a unifom1 voting system, and to ensure full compliance wi th the
Federal " He lp America Vote" Act of 2002, the Cook County Clerk and the Chicago Board of Elections

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
RESOLUTION SUPPORTING PROPOSED EXTENSION OF THE 7% EXPANDED
HOMEOWNER EXEMPTION
WHEREAS, property values throughout Cook County have been increasing at an overwhelming rate,
with an estimated median increase of 4 1% in the City of Chicago for 2006; and
WHEREAS, the tremendous burden property taxes place on homeowners forces many of our city's Jongtenn residents out of their neighborhoods, particularly working families and seniors on fixed incomes;
and
WHEREAS, it is difficult for Cook County taxpayers to anticipate and budget for the large property tax
increases incurred every three years as a result of triennial reassessments; and
WHEREAS, limiting annual increases in assessments throughout the County would provide financial
assistance to our residents, and help ensure the diversity and affordability of our neighborhoods;
WHEREAS, due to the ever-increasing property tax burden, many Jong time residents are unable to
remain in the prospering neighborhoods they helped to create; and

13

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 5, 2006

WHEREAS, increases in the median income of Cook County residents has not kept pace with the
dramatic increases in property values; and
WHEREAS, extending the 7% Expanded Homeowner Exemption legislation would continue to cap
taxable assessment increases at 7% annually, providing Cook County homeowners with predictability and
affordability; and
WHEREAS, the 7% Expanded Homeowner Exemption provided great financial relief to homeowners in
every comer of Cook County, reducing 80% of Chicago tax bills in the first year of its implementation.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board does hereby support the
proposed extension of the 7% Expanded Homeowner Exemption and urges the Illinois House of
Representatives to act during this legislative session to implement this reform to coincide with the 2006
City of Chicago reassessment; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that suitable copies of this Resolution be delivered to Governor
Blagojevich, Senate President Emil Jones, Jr., House Speaker Michael J. Madigan, Senator Frank
Watson, Senate Republican Leader, Representative Tom Cross, House Republican Leader and all of Cook
County' s duly elected representatives in the General Assembly; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that this Resolution shall take effect on the date of its passage and
approval.

ROB ERTO MALDONADO, County Commissioner
I am submitting this Resolution as a New Item at the April 5, 2006 Board meeting to be referred to the
Committee on Finance for further review and discussion.
The resolution orders the Cook County Clerk to withhold payments to Sequoia Voting Systems, Inc. for
the electronic election machinery supplied to Cook County until a full and complete public hearing and
investigation determines the extent that Sequoia' s voting equipment contributed to any errors on election
day and to the extreme delay in the March 21 , 2006 Primary Election results.

ROBERTO MALDONADO, County Commissioner
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, every United States citizen has a right to participate in our democracy by casting a vote for
their chosen elected official in an election administered through a fair and accurate voting process; and

14

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 5, 2006

WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners is committed to the integrity of each vote cast by
its residents and has entrusted the Cook County Clerk's office to admi nister and protect its election
process; and
WHEREAS, responding to the " hanging chads" debacle of the 2000 presidential election, Congress
sought to fix our voting process by implementing electronic voting, also known as "e-voting", through
the Help American Vote Act (HA VA), and released $2 billion in federal funds to modernize state's voting
systems by January 1, 2006; and
WHEREAS, in 2005 , the Cook County Board, in compliance with the HA VA mandate, approved the
Cook County Clerk's office recommendation of California-based Sequoia Voting Systems, Inc. to
provide updated voting equipment for the suburban county precincts at a cost of$23.8 million; and
WHEREAS, the Chicago Board of Election Commissioners also selected Sequoia Voting Systems, Inc.
approving a $28 million contract for new voting equipment in the city of Chicago; and
WHEREAS, in the March 21 , 2006 Primary Election, Sequoia Voting Systems, Inc . launched its dualmachine e-voting system consisting of touch screen machines (primarily to aid persons with disabilities,
but available to all voters) and paper ballot optical scanners; and
WHEREAS, with widespread reports of equipment failure coupled with human error resulting from
using new technology, the 2006 Primary Election will be remembered as a ballot counting disaster, with
problems delaying final vote counts for nearly a full week after election day, compared to the old-style
punch card system which tabulated 90 percent of the votes within one hour of the closing of the polls; and
WHEREAS, although election judges were required to participate in a three-hour instructional class as
mandated by the Illinois Board of Election Commissioners, roughly 4,000 of the 14,000 election judges in
Chicago failed to attend a training session for the new equipment, according to Daniel W. White,
Executive Director of the Illinois Board of Elections; and
WHEREAS, reports of equipment failure penneated election day, when optical scanners broke down and
machines failed as election judges tried to merge voting results of the two systems at the close of polls;
and
WHEREAS, defective and damaged memory cards containing vote totals prevented data from being sent
via cellular technology to the central counting centers and instead data cartridges were sent via taxi to the
central office; and
WHEREAS, one day after the polls closed, Chicago was missing 252 memory cartridges with another
162 memory cartridges unaccounted for in suburban Cook County; and
WHEREAS, reports of Sequoia machine malfunctions in counties across the nation during the 2004
election, including Bernalillo and Sandoval Counties in New Mexico, Snohomish County in Washington
and Palm Beach County in Florida may have foreshadowed Cook County' s problems with the new voting
machines; and
WHEREAS, the implementation of " modernized" e-voting equipment in Cook County 's March 2 I
Primary Election left many candidates, participants in the election, public officials, and voters questioning
the integrity of the voting process and highly skeptical of the upcoming General Election in November.

15

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 5, 2006

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that we the Cook County Board of Commissioners do
hereby order the Cook County Clerk to withhold scheduled payments to Sequoia Voting Systems, Inc. for
the election machine1y supplied to Cook County until a full and complete public hearing and investigation
detennines the extent that Sequo ia's voting equipment contributed to any errors on election day and to the
extreme delay in the March 21, 2006 Primary Election results, which may prove Sequoia failed to meet its
contractual obligations to the County.

Commissioner Daley, seconded by Commissioner Silvestri, moved to suspend the rules so that this matter
may be considered. The motion carried unanimously.
Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Steele, moved that the Proposed Resolution be
