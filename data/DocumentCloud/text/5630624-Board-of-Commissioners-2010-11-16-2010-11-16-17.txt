EXPLANATION
Pursuant to the Board’s Resolution approved January 18, 2005, the CHA entered into an IGA with
Fleet for a three-year initial term, with two (2) three-year renewal options. Under the terms of the IGA,
The City of Chicago Fleet Services provides fuel and car washes, road and towing services for all forty
(40) CHA owned vehicles at Fleet’s rates.. In July 2009, the Board authorized the CHA to exercise the
IGA’s first 3-year option.
During the term of the IGA, the CHA has closely monitored the prevailing fuel prices in the private
market and has found that the prices extended to the CHA by Fleet remain considerably lower than
those in the private market. The price of car washes through Fleet’s vendors has remained constant and
remained less than other local car washes, although an annual increase due to the increasing cost of
energy is anticipated from both Fleet’s vendors and the private market. Fleet’s increased price will,
however, continue to be lower than if the CHA procured this service from the private market.
The original IGA permits the CHA to utilize Fleet’s tow and repair services. However, because the
prices charged by the Fleet for towing and repairs have been determined to be higher than those of
private vendors, they have been used infrequently and only on an emergency basis.
Based upon the foregoing, it is in the best interest of the CHA to exercise the second three-year option
to renew the Intergovernmental Agreement with Fleet for the period of January 1, 2011 through
December 31, 2013 for an amount not-to-exceed $190,212.00 for fuel, car washes and emergency
towing and repairs.
