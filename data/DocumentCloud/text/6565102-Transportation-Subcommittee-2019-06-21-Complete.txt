Green Streets:

BACKGROUND

Green Streets reflect the transportation policy and design approach that
minimizes environmental impact by focusing on efforts to retain, treat and
eliminate runoff at the source using green infrastructure applications. Green
infrastructure helps replicate natural hydrologic functions like storage,
detention, infiltration, filtration, evaporation, transpiration, and uptake by
plants, and can improve water quality and reduce runoff volumes. These
natural functions are often lost in transportation projects where impervious
road surfaces prevent rain water from soaking into the ground.

 City of Cleveland

BACKGROUND

• Ordinance 789-11
•

To provide for the consideration of Complete and Green Street elements in
all construction projects within the public right of way

• Typologies Plan 2013
•

6-1

To provide a framework and guide for Cleveland to use in its efforts towards
developing a network of Complete and Green Streets throughout the City

 BACKGROUND
City of Cleveland Heights
• Resolution No. 37-2018
•

Complete and Green Streets are roadways designed and operated to
safely and comfortably accommodate users of all ages and abilities,
including cyclists, pedestrians, transit riders, elderly, delivery and
service personnel, and emergency responders; and to reduce,
accommodate and slow stormwater runoff as part of a
comprehensive stormwater management system.

 BACKGROUND

NEORSD:

 

Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District Green infrastructure Policy

We activeiv pursue opportunities across our program areas to advocate for strategic and
cost?effective impiemen tation and maintenance ofgreen infrastructure technoiogies and
innovations that protect, preserve, enhance and restore the no turaiI hydroiogic function of
our region?s watersheds. in addition, we seek to maximize the co-benefits provided by green
infrastructure projects inciuding opportunities to expand urban naturalI areas, enhance air

quaiitv, and improve quaiity of iife in Northeast Ohio.

BACKGROUND
Benefits of Complete and Green Streets
• Increase Safety
• Improve Health
• Improve Air Quality
• Improve Water Quality
• Economic Revitalization
• Lower Transportation Costs
• Create livable Communities
• Create Equity
• Reduce Traffic Congestion
6-1

 BACKGROUND

Why Develop a Stand Alone Complete and Green Streets Policy
• To change practice, integrating the needs of all road users into
everyday transportation planning and design practices
• To gradually create a complete network of streets that serve all users
• To save money: in the long run, retrofit projects always cost more than
getting it right the first time
• To apply solutions across the region to address systematic inequities
• To create fast, low-cost, and high-impact changes in the region
• To implement NOACA’s Regional Strategic Plan

6-1

 BACKGROUND
Draft Complete and Green Streets Policy
• All projects requesting inclusion to the LRTP and/or TIP will be reviewed
against this policy for opportunities to expand complete and green streets in
the NOACA region.
• All projects requesting NOACA administered funds shall be required to
adhere to this policy and are therefore eligible for NOACA funding
participation to implement complete and green street recommendations.

6-1

 BACKGROUND
Goals of the Draft Complete and Green Streets Policy
• Create a comprehensive, integrated, and connected transportation network
that supports sustainable development and provides livable communities.
• Ensure safety, ease of use, and ease of transfer between modes for all users
of the transportation system.
• Restore the natural hydrologic function of the region’s watersheds.
• Provide flexibility for different types of streets, areas, and users.

6-1

 BACKGROUND
Requirements
•
•
•
•

Consider all users
Follow accepted design standards
Prioritize safety
Consider green infrastructure during project scoping

Exceptions

• Project on low ADT road
• Bicyclists and pedestrians prohibited
• Extreme topographic constraints
6-1

 NEXT STEPS
Subcommittee Input will inform the Policy Committee
members as they consider the Complete and Green
Streets Policy at the July 2019 meeting

6-1

 NOACA will STRENGTHEN regional
cohesion, PRESERVE existing
infrastructure, and BUILD a
sustainable multimodal transportation
system to SUPPORT economic
development and ENHANCE quality
of life in Northeast Ohio.
