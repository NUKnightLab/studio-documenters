measures, sequencing, and protections shall be incorporated in the
structural and architectural drawings. A licensed structural engineer

Historic Preservation Division;

Preservation Division staff shall be contacted to inspect the condition
of the historic wood clapboard siding and to confirm if any scarring
exists indicating any original features. The historic wood siding for the
front façade shall remain and be repaired, wherever possible. Areas
beyond repair, as confirmed by staff, may be replaced with new wood
siding to match the historic siding in size, type and profile. The west
facade, considering the majority of this side is obscured with the
adjacent structure, may be re-sided with new wood siding with a lap
dimension to match the historic siding. The east facade may be resided with smooth-faced fiber cement siding to meet code
requirements with a thickness and lap dimension to closely match the
historic siding. Samples shall be submitted to Historic Preservation
staff for review and approval as part of permit application and any
replacement of siding per the stated conditions shall be done elevationby-elevation;
The existing roof and wall sheathing shall be retained with select
replacement only as needed. Any areas of replacement shall be

occurring;

physical evidence uncovered. Enlarged dimensioned details of the
clad-wood windows, wood trim and cornice, and paneled wood door
shall be submitted with the permit application;
The front stair risers shall be closed, the wood shall be painted or
stained, and the railings shall incorporate decorative newel posts at the
top and base of the steps with a pipe rail consistent with historic stair
and railing designs of similar building types. Enlarged details shall be
included in the permit plans; and,
