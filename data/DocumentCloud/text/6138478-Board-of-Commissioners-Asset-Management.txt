NOTICE AND AGENDA

December 13, 2017

Whereas, based on Clerk of the Circuit Court for Cook County data for 2016 and 2017, there has been a
47.8% decline in new court cases over the last 10 years across all case types. More specifically, there
has been a 35.4% decline in civil cases, a 56.8% decline in criminal cases, and a 49.5% decline in traffic
cases; and
WHEREAS, this continued decline in case volume suggests that the Circuit Court of Cook County’s 333
courtrooms, originally built to handle the large case volume of the 1970s and 1980s, may currently have
excess capacity; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Circuit Court Branch Court locations are in some of the poorest physical
conditions of any Cook County court houses, needing $25.3 million in repairs over the next 10 years; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Criminal Justice Stakeholders are working continuously and cooperatively
to safely reduce the financial burden of operating the criminal justice system upon Cook County
taxpayers; and
WHEREAS, effective reforms may be instituted only with the support of comprehensive data, accessible
to and acceptable to all of the stakeholders; and
WHEREAS, in light of the need for functional and safe courthouses for the efficient operations of the
Cook County Circuit Court System as well the aging facilities, there is a need to determine what
resources will be needed in the future and what alternatives are available to secure those resources; and
WHEREAS, a courtroom utilization study should be performed so that the use of the Cook County
Circuit Court courtrooms (including Branch Courts and District Court Houses) may be maximized, with
court calls correctly sized and scheduled based on a complete understanding of when, for how long and in
what ways, courtrooms are used; and
WHEREAS, such a study should be obtained from an appropriate vendor, capable of providing a brief but
comprehensive report outlining the best practices and recent trends. The scope of the study should include
but not be limited to:
·

A review of the existing documents and reports prepared by the Bureau of Asset Management
including but not limited to space utilization plans and Facilities Building Assessment reports;

·

A review of the needs for the judicial system and its’ associated spaces;

·

A review of the organizational needs for each of the public safety offices;

·

Proposed solutions for reallocation & reorganization; and

·

Probable cost(s) for the work proposed.

WHEREAS, the commissioned study shall also at a minimum include a break dows of the following:

WHEREAS, the selected vendor, in coordination with the Bureau of Asset Management, will work with
Department of Budget and Management Services, Sheriff’s Office, and Office of the Chief Judge to
establish a formal process and reporting mechanism to ensure that all stakeholders understand roles and
responsibilities as well as project deliverables, budgets and schedules for the Project Team; and
WHEREAS, in partnership with the Bureau of Asset Management and Department of Budget and
Management Services, all the public safety offices including the Office of the Chief Judge, Sheriff’s
Office, Public Defender’s Office, State’s Attorney’s Office, Clerk of the Circuit Court’s Office and the
Justice Advisory Council shall participate in the planning process and provide any and all necessary data
and evidence needed for the study, excluding any data and evidence limited by law; and
WHEREAS, time is of the essence and to the extent possible the project should be completed as quickly
as possible but no later than May, 2018; and
WHEREAS, the courtroom utilization study will provide valuable guidance for further consideration of
the investment of general revenue in the operation as well as repair and rehabilitation of courtrooms used
by the criminal justice stakeholders and the buildings in which such courtrooms are located.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that the
public safety stakeholders work collaboratively with an external vendor managed by the Bureau of Asset
Management on a Court Utilization Study and that they be prepared to brief the Board on their progress
and final results of the study.
