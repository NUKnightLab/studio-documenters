304533

A RESOLUTION TO CONDUCT A FEASIBILITY STUDY FOR ESTABLISHING A
REVOLVING BOND LOAN FUND (PROPOSED RESOLUTION) Submitting a
Proposed Resolution sponsored by Earlean Collins, County Commissioner.
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, Cook County is a home rule unit of local government pursuant to
Article 7, Section 6(a) of the Illinois Constitution of 1970 with power to regulate
those matters which pertain to it’s governmental affairs; and
WHEREAS, Cook County is committed to public safety and maintaining compliance
with the Federal court’s Duran Decree at Cook County Jail; and
WHEREAS, the constant increase in crime due to the rapid increase in
unemployment coupled with the thousands of former inmates released from prison
without any job opportunities or skills to provide a living for themselves pose
serious challenges to the Cook County budget to carry out our mission; and
WHEREAS, Cook County Jail has an overwhelming number of detainees who are
awaiting trials for minor charges who pose no real flight risk or harm to themselves
or others; and
WHEREAS, such detainees could be diverted to alternative monitoring systems
outside of Cook County Jail; and
WHEREAS, when inmates are housed in Cook County Jail they lose all of their
health benefits and Cook County has to shoulder the burden of the cost for health,
security and other necessities which is putting a serious strain on our budget in
addition to keeping Cook County from maintaining compliance with the decree; and
WHEREAS, the County will be more financially responsible if they established a
Revolving Loan Fund which would loan bond amounts to persons arrested for
minor crimes. Qualified persons must be employed at time of arrest, with a good
work history, agree to continue to work to enter into a payback agreement plan that
would allow payments of the loan to be deducted from their employment checks
and sent directly to the loan fund.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and the Cook County
Board of Commissioners conduct a feasibility study for establishing a Revolving
Bond Loan Fund for qualified arrestees awaiting trial in order to eliminate the cost
of housing them in jail and to ensure public safety.
