The following project was reviewed by the PRC:
1.

2121 W. Walton
(Ukrainian Village District – 32nd Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed rehabilitation of a single family residence including construction of
one new dormer on the east roof, extension of one existing dormer on the west
roof, changing existing windows openings on secondary elevations, including
installation of French doors and a Juliet balcony on the east, and construction of
a 1-story rear addition.

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. As proposed, dormer siding shall be horizontal wood siding to match the
size, type and profile of historic wood siding typically found in the district.
Details of the proposed siding shall be reviewed and approved by Historic
Preservation staff as part of the permit application;
2. New windows visible from the public right-of-way shall be wood or cladwood windows, and shall retain or replicate any existing brick molds.
Should no brick molds remain on the existing windows the applicant shall
propose a brick mold typical for this type of building. Details of the
proposed windows and brickmold shall be reviewed and approved by
Historic Preservation staff as part of the permit application; and,
3. Any future stairs and landing on the east elevation shall be as minimal as
possible and descend toward the rear of the property.

 2.

2018 W. Walton
(Ukrainian Village District Extension – 32nd Ward)
Proposal:

Revised design of a previously reviewed project for a new 2-1/2 story masonry
single-family home on a vacant mid-block lot: increased stoop height, increased
size of basement windows, west-facing dormer relocated further from front
façade, and new east-facing dormer.

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. The proposed west- and east-facing wall dormers are approved as proposed
with a set back from the front façade by 20’, a slope of 4:12 for the shed
roofs of the dormers, and with the top of the dormers 3’-2” below the top of
the main roof. The fiber cement siding for the sides of the new dormers
shall have a 4” lap with a smooth finish and shall be painted to match the
color of the brick on the side facades or to match the color of the roofing;
2. The proposed face brick for the front façade (Yankee Hill, Old Fort, standard
modular-sized) is not compatible and a new brick to be more uniform in red
color, consistent with the front facades of the adjacent historic cottages, shall
be submitted to Historic Preservation staff for review and approval. The
brick for the sides and rear facades (Boral, Arlington Antique, standard
modular-sized) is approved as submitted. Mortar samples, in colors to match
the bricks, shall be submitted to Historic Preservation staff review and
approval prior to order and installation; and,
3. The front stair, proposed to be 6’-7”-tall and constructed of concrete with
limestone treads and risers shall be modified to a painted metal stair with
closed risers and trellis on the sides.
The Committee approved the proposed side yard reductions, as depicted on the
site plan, as necessary to meet the predominant house widths contributing to the
district’s character, pursuant to Title 17, Sec. 13-1003-G of the Chicago Zoning
Ordinance.

3.

4940 S. Woodlawn
(Kenwood District – 4th Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed relocation of the existing curb cut and driveway from the north side of
the property to the south side of the property and alterations to the historic fence
and balustrade.

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. The width of the new driveway, proposed to be 10’-0” wide shall be reduced
to 8’-11” wide from the historic fence to the curb cut to align with the new
fence opening;
2. Details of the contractor’s means and methods for dismantling, storing, and
reconstructing the portion of the historic fence and gate as well as the curved
balustrade shall be submitted with the permit plans; and,

 3. The owner shall apply for any required permits from the Chicago
Department of Transportation (CDOT) and address any landscape issues
with the Bureau of Forestry regarding the proposed curb cut.
4.

1729 N. St. Michaels Court
(Old Town Triangle District – 43rd Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed third-floor addition atop a two-story masonry non-contributing singlefamily residence and other alterations.

Action:

The Committee unanimously found that:
(A) The subject building at 1729 N. St. Michaels Court, a two-story masonry
structure constructed sometime after 1950, in non-contributing to the
character of the Old Town Triangle District;
(B) The project meets the Commission’s Guidelines For Alterations to Historic
Buildings and New Construction and, therefore, will not have an adverse
effect on the significant historical and architectural features of the landmark
district and conditionally approved the project, subject to these conditions
and Historic Preservation staff review and approval:
1. As shown on submitted drawings by ASW Design PC, wood siding shall
be installed on the west (front) elevation and fiber-cement siding on the
remaining elevations. The fiber-cement siding shall have a smooth
finish, and the lap exposure shall match the typical lap exposure of wood
siding. Details of the proposed siding shall be reviewed and approved by
Historic Preservation staff as part of the permit application;
2. Front entry door details and cornice details shall be included on the
permit plans; and,
3. The project as proposed would require a zoning adjustment and/or
variation, and the Commission takes no position regarding any requested
adjustment/variance relative to the zoning code requirements.

5.

2413-17 N. Orchard
(Mid-North District – 43rd Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed rehabilitation of two 2 ½-story buildings including new front porches,
garage additions, and other exterior and interior alterations.

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. As proposed, window and door openings on the front façades of 2413 and
2417 N. Orchard shall match historic sizes and locations based on physical
evidence on the siding and interior framing. Existing and proposed
elevations showing dimensions of historic openings sizes shall be included
on the permit plans;

 2. Considering the extent of deterioration of the historic wood siding, the siding
may be removed as proposed. New wood siding matching the existing wood
siding in size, profile, lap and texture shall be installed on the front facades
of both buildings and on the north elevation of 2417 N. Orchard. Fibercement siding may be used as a substitute cladding material on all other side
and rear elevations. The fiber-cement siding shall have a smooth finish and
otherwise match the existing wood siding in size, profile, and lap. Removal
and replacement of siding shall occur in phases, elevation by elevation.
Details and material samples of the existing and proposed siding shall be
reviewed and approved by Historic Preservation staff as part of the permit
application;
3. A test sample of masonry paint removal and a sample of replacement
masonry, should it be required, shall be reviewed and approved by Historic
Preservation staff prior to start of work;
4. The following shall be submitted with permit plans:
a. Front entry door details
b. Window details
c. Porch details
d. Exterior trim details at windows, doors, brackets, etc.,
e. Garage door details; and,
5. The project as proposed would require zoning adjustments and/or variation,
and the Commission takes no position regarding any requested
adjustment/variance relative to the zoning code requirements.
