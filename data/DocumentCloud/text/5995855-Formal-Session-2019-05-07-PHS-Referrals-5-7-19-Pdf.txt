FROM: David Whitaker, Direct
Legislative Policy Divi?St?on

DATE: April 26, 2019
RE: Report on Shared Mobility Agreements

Council Member Casta?eda?Lopez requested the Department of Public Works (DPW) to provide
a copy of any and all ?shared mobility?1 agreements entered into by the City of Detroit (City)
and any shared mobility companies. In addition, the Council Member requested the Legislative
Policy Division (LPD) to provide an analysis of the shared mobility agreements and whether the
contracts should come before City Council. In order for LPD to perform the requested analysis,
DPW was asked to provide a copy of any of the relative agreements to our of?ce for analysis.
LPD receive three contractual agreements and submits this report. LPD notes that none of the
contracts received relate to the use of electric scooters that are in frequent use around the City.
The City is in the process of draftng an ordinance regulating the use of some shared mobility
apparatus such as electric scooters.2

The shared mobility agreements provided consist of: the Memorandum of Agreement for
Bicycle Share Program between the City of Detroit and the DDP Bike Share Corporation (DDP
Bike Share), approved by City Council on July 22, 2016; (ii) the Professional Services Contract
between the City of Detroit and Shift Transit (Shift), approved by City Council on July 22, 2016;
and the Car Sharing Pilot Program Operating Agreement between the City of Detroit and
Maven Drive, LLC (Maven), approved by City Council on November 20, 2018.

 

Shared mobility is the shared use of a vehicle, scooter, bicycle, or other travel mode. Shared mobility
provides users with short-term access to one of these modes of travel as they are needed.

2 The Law Department is currently drafting ordinance language that will regulate electric scooters as allowed under
state law.

LPD begins with the ?rst referenced agreement with the DDP Bike Share. In accordance with the
Agreement?s recitals, the City and the Downtown Detroit Partnership determined that a public
bike share program was a feasible project to undertake3. The Downtown Detroit Partnership
created the DDP Bike Share entity, to operate and maintain the program. The City and the DDP
Bike Share entered into the agreement to facilitate the public bike share program.

The DDP Bike Share Agreement?s effective date is September 1, 2016. The initial term of the
Agreement is ten years (10) with an option to extend up to ?ve (5) additional years by formal
written amendment.

Article II, Responsibilities and Obligation of the City, provides that the grants obtained by the
City and the DDP from the Southeast Michigan Council of Governments (SEMCOG) and the
Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) grants will be used to support the bicycle share
program. Additionally, eligible Federal Transportation Authority (FTA) grants will be provided
as support for the bicycle share program. Section 2.03 provides:

The City shall lead and manage all aSpects of any grants provided by the City and
used to provide funding for the program. The City shall own and maintain
continuing control over all Facilities funded fully or partially by such grants, and
the PTA and any other grantor shall have a secured interest in the Facilities,
subject to divestiture of the City and grantor interest in such Facilities pursuant to
the laws, rules and regulations governing such grants. Any city approval required
by this Agreement must be in writing.

Pursuant to the Agreement, the City is responsible for supporting the program with eligible grant
proceeds and carrying out the compliance of the laws, rules and regulations as the grant

recipient. The DDP Bike Share responsibilities and obligations are set forth under Article 111.

Section 3 of the Agreement includes in pertinent part the following obligations of DDP Bike
Share:

Prepare the scope of work and speci?cations for Request for Proposals for
vendors and operations and management services;

(ii) Prepare a marketing and outreach plan forth Program;

Demonstrate capacity to provide property and commercial liability insurance;

(iv) Demonstrate ability to comply with all Federal, statutes and regulations;

Identification and accounting of private source funds (other than the City) to
satisfy capital, operating costs of the program and any matching funds required as

well as evidence and accounting of the use and disbursement as provided in the
Agreement.

 

3 The Parties reached this conclusion based upon a 2013 study that was conducted to determine the feasibility of a
public bicycle share program.

(vi) Evidence of DDP Bike Share operations and maintenance contract with
experienced vendor for day to day operations and maintenance of the Program;

(vii) Identi?cation of the mapping of Facilities;

Identi?cation and compliance with obtaining property interest on public and
private property for installing Facilities4;

(ix) Reporting to City in compliance with all PTA and City requirements as requested
by the City.

The DDP Bike Share Agreement covers the duties and responsibilities of the Parties regarding
the funding, procurement of equipment and facilities as well as the placement, maintenance and
operations of the facilities and equipment.

The Agreement between the City and Shift Transit is related to the bike share program. The Shift
Agreement pertains to the City?s obligation of obtaining the bicycles and facilities. The effective
date of the Shift Agreement is the date of City Council?s approval (July 22, 2016). The
termination date was August 31, 2018. The contract requirements to provide bicycles, facilities
including hardware and software has been performed by Shift and the contract has been
completed. The compensation provided to Shift for services rendered are to be paid for with
grant dollars as set forth under Section 7.01 and provides that the amount shall not exceed
$2,026,154 to be paid in the manner set forth in Exhibit B.5 Pursuant to the Agreement, Shift in
collaboration with the City and the DDP, was to provide the necessary equipment for a
successful and ?nancially sustainable bicycle sharing program. The purpose of this Agreement is
for Shift to provide the City the services outlined in Exhibit A: Scope of Services6. The of
services indicate that Shift will implement a bike share system that:

The System is intended to be ?nancially self-sustaining through a combination of user
revenues, fees and sponsorships.

II The System should incorporate information technology to operate a ?eet of
approximately 420 bicycles that may be taken ?'om one station and returned to another in
a network of approximately 42 stations.

0 The numbers (bicycles and stations) are guidelines for the proposed system as
recommended in the 2013 Detroit bike share feasibility study, but, Shift Transit shall use
its professional experience to recommend the optimal system size and density.

0 Implementation and launch of the system is expected to take place as early as possible in
2017. 

 

4 Facilities include bicycle racks/storage/docking stations, rental and information kiosk, security devices, and other
equipment associated with the Program and purchased using FTA grant funds. Facilities do not include bicycles.

5 Exhibit provides a breakdown of the project fees. The exhibit provides an itemized cost detail for ?Capital Cost?
including 42 stations, 420 bicycles, 714 docks and all associated hardware and software as well as ?Launch Cost?
which includes station siting and equipment installation. According to the breakdown of project fees, the ?Capital
Cost? totaled $1,652,112; the ?Launch Cost? totaled $318,486; the combined total of $1,970,598.

6 The scope of services under the Bike Share Program was performed under two separate contracts. The Contract
with the City was to provide the bicycles and station equipment. The other contract is between the DDP and Shift for
ongoing maintenance and operations of the Bike Share Program.

3

Shift is also responsible for proposing sites for installation of the system at locations that may
include both public and private property, parks, and the public right of way. The physical
infrastructure and data generated from the system shall be the sole property of the City. All
stations, bicycles and equipment of any kind shall be new when delivered to the City, whether as
original deliveries or warranted replacements.

The third shared mobility contract is the Maven contract. This Agreement is a pilot car sharing
program under which the City indicates in the recitals a desire ?to reduce overall traf?c

MEMORANDUM

From: BRANDON FRISKE (QUINN EVANS ARCHITECTS)

To: THE HONORABLE CITY COUNCIL
OFFICE OF THE CITY CLERK

DETROIT. Ml 48226

RE: 7.LIV PROJECT
19031 LIVERNOIS AVE,
DETROIT MI, 48221
31601400

Subject: Petition Request Vacation of R.O.W.

This request is being issued on behalf of Eagley Forest Property. LLC concerning the active
construction project at the corner of Livernois and Seven Mite. The petitioner is requesting to
vacate a strip of ROW. directly adjacent to the property line along Stoepel Street {Refer to
the attached Site Plan).

The vacation of the ROW. is being requested to facilitate the placement of a new
transformer for the project. The project is located on a zero lot line parcel and is built out to
the property lines in every direction with the exception of a small loading area off the alley on
the south side of the property. This is an existing condition. During the planning of the project
a location in the loading area was selected to place the transformer in an effort to conceal it.
and keep it on the property. However. due to technical limitations, not revealed until
construction was underway. DTE cannot utilize the proposed location in the loading area.

The ROW. along Stoepel is identi?ed as 100', but reduces down to 70' just south of the site.
A vacation of approximate 1510? of the ROW along the length of the Stoepel Street property
line will satisfy the requirements of DTE. while still staying in line with the adjacent narrower
ROW. south of the site. The goal is to utilize the southem end of the vacated ROW. to
locate the transformer. As part of this work. new curbs, sidewalks and landscaping will be
installed in compliance with the City of Detroit's zoning ordinance.

The project is far into construction and currently being held up until a resolution can be

reached on a ?nal transformer location. The entire team is eager to resolve this urgent issue.
If you have any questions please email me at bfriske@quinnevans.com .
