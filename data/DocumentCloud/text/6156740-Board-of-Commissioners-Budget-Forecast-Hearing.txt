COOK
COUNTY

PRELIMINARY
FORECAST

FY 2015

PRESIDENT

Board of Commissioners

 Overview of Cook County 2015 Preliminary Forecast
Overview
The Department of Budget and Management Services (DBMS) prepared this preliminary forecast
report in accordance with Executive Order 2012-1. The report presents a mid-year projection of
year-end revenues and expenses for 2014, and an initial forecast of fiscal year 2015 revenues and
expenditures.
For FY2015, DBMS anticipates a budget shortfall of $168.9 million in the County’s General and
Health Enterprise Funds. Projected expenditures of $2,961.6 million will exceed projected revenues
of $2,792.69 million. The projected shortfall is driven by an increase in projected expenditures of
$75.2 million and a decrease in expected revenues of $43 million in the General Fund, while the
Health Fund anticipates an increase in expenditures that are $50 million greater than the increase in
revenues.
In the General Fund, projected cost increases driving this gap are an increase in expenditures for
projected wages including public safety overtime expenses ($48.1M), employee health benefit
increases ($20.1M), a reserve for insurance claims ($6.7M), and utilities such as gas, electricity and
water ($2.4M). Revenue declines are driven by lower Property Taxes available to the General Fund
due to rising debt service costs (-$22.2M), the reduction of Motor Fuel Tax revenues funding public
safety activities (-$10.0M) and slower than expected recovery on economically sensitive revenues
such as the Recorder of Deeds fees and Sales Tax.
The impact of CountyCare, the County’s managed care program that began as an early
implementation program of the Affordable Care Act, is a significant driver of changes in the
County’s fiscal outlook from 2014 to 2015. Through CountyCare, the health system is reimbursed
for providing healthcare that was previously uncompensated. The Health Fund anticipates a $384.1
million increase in expenditures along with a $334.0 million increase in revenues primarily due to the
full implementation of CountyCare. Beginning July 1, 2014, CountyCare will become a County
Managed Care Community Network (MCCN) and will expand to include all Medicaid populations,
including Family Health Plans (FHP) and Seniors and Persons with Disabilities (SPD).
The 2014 year-end projections of revenues and expenditures forecast a deficit of $85.9 million. The
primary driver of the deficit ($67.3M) is expenditures outpacing revenues within the Health Fund
due to required repayment of unspent 2013 per member per month (PMPM) reimbursement and
expected reduction in reimbursement rates for the County’s Medicaid Expansion program starting
July 1, 2014. It is estimated that the Cook County Health and Hospital System (CCHHS) will be
required to reimburse Medicaid for costs not incurred during the waiver period that total $33.5
million while the new PMPM reimbursement rate effective July 1, 2014 is expected to reduce yearend revenue by $29 million.

 General Fund expenditures are also anticipated to be higher than budgeted by $12.0 million, driven
by increases in public safety hiring and overtime. Revenues in the General Fund are expected to end
the year lower than budgeted by $6.6 million.

Public Forum
A public hearing and online forum will be held on the preliminary budget on July 16, 2014 at 6:00
p.m. in the Cook County Board Room to obtain constituent feedback on budget priorities. The
Department of Budget and Management Services will work closely with residents, elected officials,
and County departments to review potential efficiencies and cost savings opportunities that will

 Overview of Expenditure Estimates
2014 Year-End Expenditure Estimates
General Fund expenditures by the end of the current fiscal year are projected to be $12.0 million
higher than the 2014 Appropriation. The overage is primarily attributable to increases in public
safety overtime ($24.5M). This increase is partially offset by lower than anticipated hiring in other
departments including personnel savings in the Offices under the President as well as Juvenile and
Adult Probation.
The Health Fund is expected to spend $310.1 million higher than the 2014 appropriation, which is
partially offset by revenues over budget in the amount of $243.6 million, a 25.6% increase. The
reason behind this increase is the higher than expected population CCHHS is serving in
CountyCare, especially as more CountyCare members are served through external providers than
expected. In addition, there are more modest increases in overtime and utility expenses. These
increased costs are partially mitigated by greater than expected attrition at the beginning of the year.
Projected 2015 Expenditures
Total FY2015 expenditures in the General Fund are projected to increase by $75.2 million over the
FY2014 adjusted appropriation, a 5.5 percent increase. This increase is driven by rising personnel
costs ($48.1M), which includes the rising cost of salaries, mandated public safety hiring and
correctional officer overtime. Another key driver of increasing expenses is employee health benefit
cost increases ($20.1M) which are expected to rise at the rate of medical inflation. The final
personnel-related expense that is expected to rise in 2015 is the cost of worker’s compensation
claims due to the resolution of outstanding claims ($1.5M). There are also several non-personnel
increases including the expected cost of self- insurance settlements ($6.7M) based on an analysis of
current cases and the rising costs of gas, electricity and water ($2.4M). These increases are offset by
minor non-personnel savings ($3.6M).
Health Fund expenditures are expected to increase by $384 million from the 2014 Appropriation, a
34% increase from the prior year. The cost increases are related to an increase in enrollees in
CountyCare, Cook County’s implementation of Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act.
A projected 59% increase in the average monthly number of CountyCare expected enrollees (from
56,131 to 89,500) is anticipated in the forecast. In addition, the Health System expects to serve
additional Medicaid populations through CountyCare, including Family Health Plan (FHP) members
and Seniors and Persons with Disabilities (SPD) members, which increases both costs and revenues.
Corresponding revenue increases partially offset the increase in expenditures, though the cost of
services at other network facilities and pharmaceutical costs are rising more rapidly than anticipated.

 Overview of Estimated Revenues
Overview
General Fund and Health Enterprise Fund revenues support the County’s general operating fund
and finance the Corporate, Public Safety and Health Enterprise funds and activities. The
preliminary revenue estimate for FY2015 is $2,793 million for the General and Health Enterprise
Funds. This represents an 11.6 percent, or $290.4 million increase from the FY2014 budget. The
total projected revenue for FY2014 year-end is $2,739 million, which represents a 9.5 percent, or
$237 million increase from budgeted revenues.
The County’s General Fund and Health Enterprise Fund revenues are comprised of Property Tax,
Fees, Home Rule Taxes, Intergovernmental Revenues, and miscellaneous Other Revenue sources
such as rental income from leasing space and energy efficiency rebates.
Property Tax
The projected year-end Property Tax collection to the General and Health Enterprise Funds for
FY2014 remains at the budgeted amount of $350.1 million. The preliminary estimate for Property
Tax revenues in FY2015 is $327.9 million, reduced from the prior fiscal year budget by $22.2 million
primarily due to rising debt service obligations.
Fees
The County General Fund receives various fees for certain services that departments within the
Fund perform. The fees charged by various County departments include fees for real estate
transactions, court case filings, permits, and licenses. General Fund fees are anticipated to be $263.5
million for year-end FY2014.
This represents a 3.9 percent, or $10.6 million decrease in
comparison to the FY2014 budget. The reduction is due to a decrease in court case filings and real
estate transactions. The preliminary estimate for General Fund fees in FY2015 remains relatively
steady at $260.9 million, a 1.0 percent decrease in comparison to projected year-end FY2014.
The Health Enterprise Fund receives fees from patient fees and supplemental payments for care
provided at County Hospitals. In addition, the Cook County Health and Hospital System (CCHHS)
operates CountyCare, which will become a Managed Care Community Network (MCCN) on July 1,
2014. CountyCare receives a fixed per member per month reimbursement for each of its members.
CCHHS is projected to end FY2014 with fees totaling $1.19 billion, a 25.6 percent, or $243.6 million
increase to the FY2014 budget. These increased fees are, however, offset with higher than
anticipated expenditures for patient care expenses at CCHHS as well as external network providers
and pharmaceutical costs. The increased 2014 revenues are mainly attributed to the increased
number of enrollees into CountyCare. CCHHS had expected full-year membership of 56,131
patients in CountyCare, but over 90,000 members are enrolled as the 1115 Waiver period concludes
at the end of June, 2014. CCHHS preliminary estimate for fees in FY2015 increases 7.6%, or $90.4
million to $1.28 billion compared to year-end FY2014, with some attrition anticipated in the second
half of the year. The continued rise is due to an increase in disproportionate share hospital (DSH)

4

 supplemental payments and a projected retention of CountyCare enrollees as additional MCCN
choices for CountyCare patients become available during the second half of 2014 and into FY2015.
Home Rule Taxes
Several of the Home Rule Taxes are on track to meet or exceed the FY2014 budgeted amounts.
The projected year-end revenues of $775.3 million exceed budgeted revenues by $11.1 million, or
1.5 percent. The County Use Tax projected year-end revenue for FY2014 is $69.9 million,
representing a 2.4 percent, or $1.6 million increase from the budget due to improved vehicle sales.
The Gas Tax is projected to reap the benefits of enhanced compliance activities. The Gas Tax is
projected to earn $12.4 million, 14.2 percent more than the budgeted amount. A revenue source
that has underperformed is the Sales Tax as the regional economy continues its slow recovery from
the recession and experienced particularly slow activity during an unusually cold winter. Sales Tax
revenues in FY2014 are projected to be $3.2 million, or 1.0 percent lower than FY2014 budget.
The preliminary estimate for revenues for Home Rule Taxes for FY2015 is $770.7 million, which is
$6.4 million more than prior year budgeted revenues of $764.3 million. The estimated increase in
Home Rule Tax revenues are primarily linked to modestly improved Sales Tax collections as a result
of economic forecasts suggesting a moderate improvement in conditions during FY2015.
Intergovernmental Revenues
The projected year-end Intergovernmental Revenues for FY2014 is $136.8 million, this represents a
$2.1 million, or 1.5% decrease from the budgeted amount. The lower than expected revenues are
due in-part to Off-Track Betting commissions as an increase in gambling alternatives are estimated
to contribute to a decline in expected revenues by $1.0 million. The preliminary estimate for
Intergovernmental Revenues for FY2015 is $129.1 million, which is $9.7 million less than the prior
year budget. This decline is driven predominantly by the planned decrease in Motor Fuel Tax
funding in the amount of $10 million.
Other Revenues
The County is projecting to receive miscellaneous Other Revenues totaling $19.2 million in FY2014;
this represents a $5.1 million decrease from the FY2014 budgeted. The decrease is driven by lower
than expected parking fees. The preliminary estimate for Other Revenues for FY2015 is $19.4
million, which is a minimal increase of $0.2 million compared to FY2014 year-end revenues due
primarily to additional rental income at the George W. Dunne Building.
