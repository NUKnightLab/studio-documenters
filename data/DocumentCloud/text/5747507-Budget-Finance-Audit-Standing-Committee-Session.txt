Representation and indemni?cation by the City of Detroit of the City employee(s) or of?cer(s)

Department, and believe that the City Council should ?nd and determine that the suit against the

police of?cers (protection of of?cers and their families against litigation costs and damage awards)
will not be met by representing and indemnifying Commander Timothy Leach and Detective
Frederick Person in this case. We, therefore, recommend a vote on the attached resolution.

As such, pursuant to Section 13-11-5 of the 1984 Detroit City Code, City Council shall hold a
hearing for police of?cers who have been denied representation. A request for such a hearing is

being made at this time.

Honorable City Council
Subject: Request to Amend the Of?cial Compensation Schedule

Recommendation is submitted to amend the 2018 - 2019 Of?cial Compensation Schedule to include the
pay range of $75,333 - $98,804 for the classi?cation of Recruitment Manager I
(13-119936).

Request:
The above recommendation is at the request of Daryl Conrad, Recruitment Of?cer for the Human
Resources Department.

Rationale:

The above request and recommendation is based on the need for a manager position to be allocated to the
Recruitment Division. The position of Recruitment Manager I will manage all recruitment functions and
employees servicing each city department. This will allow for improved direction, communication, decision
making and customer service while allowing the Chief Recruitment Of?cer to set recruitment strategy and
interact with departments to improve city-wide services.

Survey data of other government entities within Michigan was obtained from the American Society of
Employers (ASE) and CompAnalyst for market pricing purposes. The ?nal recommendation is based upon
the market pricing results as well as comparable positions internally.

Based on the survey data Classi?cation and Compensation recommends the above proposed salary. Subject
to City Council approval.
