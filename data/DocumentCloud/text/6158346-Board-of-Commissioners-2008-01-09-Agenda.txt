PROPOSED RESOLUTION
RESOLUTION REQUESTING THE SET ASIDE OF HOME FUNDS
FOR THE TOWN OF CICERO
WHEREAS, according to the 1990 U.S. Census, Cicero was reported to have 23,179 occupied housing
units with a population of 67,436; and
WHEREAS, over the next ten years, Cicero’s population increased to 85,616, but with an accompanying
drop in the number of occupied housing units to 23,115; and
WHEREAS, presently, Cicero’s population is estimated to be over 100,000, a forty percent increase from
1990 or 23,000 additional people living in the same number of housing units that were available in 1990;
and
WHEREAS, the age of Cicero’s housing units, over 95% were constructed prior to 1970, has led to a
large number of health and safety hazards, such as structural deficiencies in heating, plumbing, and
electrical systems as well as the fact that the majority of these homes contain lead paint; and
WHEREAS, the unfortunate result of these deficiencies is a large number of families in need of
rehabilitating their homes and a disproportionate number of Cicero children under the age of six being
effected by lead poisoning; and
WHEREAS, the need for housing rehabilitation in Cicero has outgrown it’s available financial resources,
with over three hundred families on a waiting list requesting funds to rehabilitate their homes; and
WHEREAS, during the last two years the town has used a portion of its CDBG allocation to fund an
Emergency Assistance Program, providing funds up to $4,999 to repair a hazardous condition requiring
immediate action to protect the health and safety of residents; and
WHEREAS, the town’s Home Repair Program will be reinstated this year with a cap of $4,999 to assist
homeowners who do not qualify for the Emergency Assistance Program; and
WHEREAS, this cap results from the requirement to provide Lead Abatement in any residential
rehabilitation project costing more than $5,000, and the lack of available local funding coupled with the
large number of units in need of rehabilitation; and
WHEREAS, the age of Cicero’s housing array, and the fact that many of the occupied housing units are
severely overcrowded, has had a negative impact on the safety and livability of these units; and
WHEREAS, complicating this significant problem is the fact that Cicero is a minority community, made
up of approximately 85% Hispanics, and nearly 20% of its residents have incomes at or below the poverty
level, greatly limiting their ability to afford needed housing repairs; and
WHEREAS, since 1991, the Town of Cicero has been an integral part of the Cook County Consortium
related to the HOME and American Dream Down Payment Initiative; and
WHEREAS, as part of the Consortium, Cicero contributes 11.1% of the total dollar amount received by
Cook County for these programs or about $650,000 to $700,000 annually; and

RESOLUTIONS continued
ITEM #5 cont’d
WHEREAS, although many communities in Cook County have benefited from these housing funds, the
Town of Cicero, with a need as great as any other community, has yet to receive any funding under these
programs, a potential loss of some $10 million; and
WHEREAS, Cicero is not able to keep up with the demand and need for housing rehabilitation, it is
calling upon the County of Cook to set aside $1.5 million in HOME funds annually to the Town of Cicero
over the next ten years, and $750 thousand thereafter; and
WHEREAS, Cicero intends to use these dollars to increase the number of Cicero residents in need of
housing rehabilitation to be able to do so.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners, does
hereby request the Cook County Department of Planning and Development set aside HOME funds for the
Town of Cicero for the purpose of improving the housing conditions of its residents; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that this Honorable Body thanks the Town of Cicero for their
continuing contributions to these worthwhile causes and wholeheartedly encourages their efforts at
improving the safety and well being of its citizens.

loans in foreclosure; and
WHEREAS, the rate of foreclosures in some Cook County neighborhoods has increased over 100% from

ITEM #34
REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON CONSTRUCTION #291502
Transmitting a Communication, dated December 17, 2007 from
BRUCE WASHINGTON, Director, Office of Capital Planning and Policy
Transmitted herewith for your approval is a request for authorization to enter into a professional services
contract with Roula Associates Architects, Chtd., Chicago, Illinois, selected from the Request for
Qualifications/Proposals process. The services required are design and construction administration for
the Residential Treatment Unit - Reception Classification Diagnostic Center (RTU-RCDC) Project at the
Department of Corrections. It is respectfully requested that this Honorable Body approve this request.
Reason:

This project will provide a new facility to combine and house the Department of
Corrections Reception Classification Diagnostic Center (RCDC or intake facility) which
processes admissions into the Department of Corrections (DOC) and Cermak Health
Services of Cook County and a Residential Treatment Unit (RTU). The program includes
new intake, holding, and processing areas, clinics, medical services and associated
administrative functions, dormitories and auxiliary dormitory functions. In recent years,
this system has had to respond to the demands of increasing numbers of inmate admissions
and mental health evaluations and treatment. The existing RCDC and RTU facilities can no
longer accommodate the volume of admissions, screenings and care required. The facilities
are overcrowded, basic amenities are inadequate, building systems are outdated and in some
cases non-functional.
The new facility will meet current “Essential Standards” set by the National Commission on
Correctional Health Care and the American Correctional Association which are required for
maintaining accreditation, and will provide for an efficient and orderly intake process
including screening and provision of care.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $4,300,000.00. Bond Issue (20000 Account).
Sufficient funds have been appropriated to cover this request.

contract with HOH Systems, Inc., Chicago, Illinois, selected from the Request for
Qualifications/Proposals process. The services required are design and construction administration for
the Courthouse Server Consolidation project. It is respectfully requested that this Honorable Body

Reason:

This project will allow the Bureau of Information Technology & Automation to locate
centralized server farms in each of our main courthouses with the appropriate environmental
elements, which will be backed-up automatically over the Wide Area Network. This
consolidated server farm will be highly secure, with cameras and located racks. The 2nd,

BRUCE WASHINGTON, Director, Office of Capital Planning and Policy
Transmitted herewith for your approval is a request for authorization to enter into a professional services
contract with Globetrotters Engineering Corporation, Chicago, Illinois, selected from the Request for
Qualifications/Proposals process. The services required are design and construction administration for
the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center HVAC Upgrade. It is respectfully requested that this
Honorable Body approve this request.
Reason:

This project will replace and upgrade HVAC systems at the Juvenile Temporary Detention
Center West and East Buildings. The work includes converting the existing chiller/heater
absorber HVAC system into a separate boiler and chiller system to provide energy efficient
heating and cooling to the west addition. It also includes the replacement and upgrade of
fan coil units and chilled water valves and pneumatic controls for the East portion of the
building. Electrical upgrades as required to adequately handle all HVAC equipment are
included.

contract with Delta Engineering, Inc., Chicago, Illinois, selected from the Request for
Qualifications/Proposals process. The services required are design and construction administration for
the HVAC Upgrade for Buildings 3 and 4 located at the South Campus at the Department of Corrections.
It is respectfully requested that this Honorable Body approve this request.
Reason:

Currently only Building 3 has central air conditioning on floor 1 and part of floor 2, and the
air conditioning unit is defective. All other air conditioning in the buildings is provided by
window units. The units are a security risk in that they can be removed by detainees for
egress or dissembled for parts. The provision of central air conditioning throughout the two
buildings will eliminate this security risk and provide more efficient climate control and
energy conservation.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $250,000.00. Bond Issue (20000 Account).
Sufficient funds have been appropriated to cover this request.

Transmitted herewith for your approval is a request for authorization to enter into a professional services
contract with U.S. Equities Realty, LLC, Chicago, Illinois, selected from the Request for
Qualifications/Proposals process. The services required are comprehensive research, programming,
planning and budget development for the Cook County Bureau of Health Master Services Plan. It is
respectfully requested that this Honorable Body approve this request.
Reason:

The intent of this project is to provide a Master Plan for the Cook County Bureau of Health
Services to include evaluation of current needs, projected needs and objectives and to
maximize the utilization of vacant and underutilized buildings at the Oak Forest Hospital of
Cook County and Provident Hospital of Cook County Campuses. All agencies, departments
and functions within the Bureau of Health Services will be assessed.
The Master Plan will also focus on the adaptive reuse of vacant buildings and/or other space
at the Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County and Provident Hospital of Cook County
Campuses to both maximize existing County building inventory and effectively consolidate
and centralize the Bureau of Health Services to enhance functionality as determined by
analysis of the program data. Existing buildings and their systems will be analyzed and
recommendations made for appropriate future use, including but not limited to sustainable
design and site improvements, mixed use potential and new/replacement construction.
Relocations of agencies and use of occupied buildings, for purposes other than which they
where originally intended, will be analyzed and incorporated into the Master Plan where it
is indicated that a relocation would serve to augment the efficiency of services.
Additionally, a study will be conducted to establish the most viable use of any surplus
building inventory that would be compatible with agencies and services being
recommended for inclusion in the Master Plan.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $1,600,000.00. Bond Issue (28000 Account).
Sufficient funds have been appropriated to cover this request.
