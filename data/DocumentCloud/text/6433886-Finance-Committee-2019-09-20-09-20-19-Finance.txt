III. Action Items (continued)
C. Proposed Transfers of Funds (Attachment #2)
Ekerete Akpan, Chief Financial Officer, provided an overview of the proposed Transfer of Funds.
Committee reviewed and discussed the item.

The

During the discussion of the item, Chair Reiter inquired regarding what is necessitating the transfer to the
Managed Care accounts. Mr. Akpan responded that the Managed Care accounts have reached their appropriation
limit; this transfer will allow movement of appropriation authority from the CCH (provider) accounts to the
Managed Care accounts, so external claims can be paid from the Managed Care side. As a fund within the Health
Fund, based on Board approval, the administration is allowed to move appropriation authority within the Fund;
there is room on the provider side and that is being moved to the Managed Care side. The organization will
remain within its appropriation limits within the Health Fund.
Chair Reiter inquired whether this amount is sufficient to cover this, based on current projections. Dr. Shannon
responded affirmatively; he noted that another transfer may be needed before the end of the fiscal year.
Director Deer, seconded by Director Munar, moved the approval of the proposed
Transfers of Funds. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
At the Board of Directors Meeting on September 27, 2019, when considering the Minutes of the Finance
Committee Meeting of September 20, 2019, a substitute Transfer of Funds was accepted, considered and
approved by the Board.

Metrics
Financials: July 2019

Mr. Akpan provided an overview of the metrics and Financials through July 2019. The Committee reviewed and
discussed the information.
The Committee discussed the FY2020 Preliminary Budget and Impact 2023 Financial Forecast, which was
approved by the CCH Board on September 13th and is expected to be presented to the Cook County Board for
their approval on September 26th. Once approved, it will be incorporated into the President’s proposed FY2020
Budget, which is then presented to the Cook County Board for approval, following departmental and public
hearings.
Chair Reiter requested that staff provide a detailed breakdown of the preliminary budget that goes a couple of
levels deeper than what was included in the presentation that the CCH Board received on September 13th. He
would like this information to be circulated to the Finance Committee. He noted that, as staff and Directors go
through working with the Commissioners on getting to a final budget, there may be adjustments made along the
way; he recommended that the Directors be informed if that happens, so the Board can see how things are
trending or changing.
During the discussion of revenue sources, Director Gugenheim mentioned the recent payment from the State for
medical education; she inquired whether this is the only new revenue source that the organization has received in
a long time. Mr. Akpan responded affirmatively, but added that the only question is, are those additional
dollars? Essentially, it is a straight pass-through, but there is an adjustment to the CountyCare rate. He noted
that there is some benefit to having a straight payment to the organization, but there is certainly an impact on the
CountyCare rates.
Director Deer asked how much the State currently owes CCH. Mr. Akpan estimated that they owe CCH
approximately $200 million; he will provide the exact amount after the meeting.
During the discussion of slide 20 of the presentation, regarding CountyCare-Observations and CCH
Reimbursement Rates, Mr. Akpan stated that $97 million comes to CCH as a provider from CountyCare. It is
important to note that the administration is moving CCH reimbursement rates to 100% of Medicaid rates, so this
is the same rate that would be paid to any other provider. Those changes have been reflected in the current
financial statements. Going forward, CountyCare will adjust its reimbursement rates anytime that the State
changes per-member per-month rates for CountyCare.

Observations on Financials
 Net Patient Service Revenues - $455M, 5% unfavorable to target due to increasing and unsustainable growth in
charity care, some lower clinical activity and lower revenue cycle activity

•

System-wide uninsured numbers
•

Captured by Visits, held at 44%

•

Captured by Charges, held at 40%

 CountyCare Capitation Revenues - $1.2B, 4% unfavorable to target due to lower than budgeted enrollment as a
result of lower State/County MCO enrollment
 Other Revenues - $3.8M , ongoing review of outstanding payments to ensure we get caught up by year end

 Cost of Pharma - $52, favorable by 4% compared to budget
