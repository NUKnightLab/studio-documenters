pursuantto Section of the Board?s Uniform Principal?s Performance Contract.

DESCRIPTION:
I. Legal Framework

The School Code grants the Chief Executive Of?cer of the Chicago Public Schools the
authority to place schools on probation to correct de?ciencies in their academic performance (105 ILCS
5134-83). The Illinois School Code further grants the Board of Education of the City of Chicago ('Board")
the authority to establish guidelines to determine the factors for placing an attendance center on probation.
105 

Pursuant to that authority, the Board has adopted policies under which Aldridge was placed on probation
for ten (10) consecutive years. The Board adopted the School Quality Rating Policy (Begins with the 2014-
2015 School Year) (Board Report and Aldridge remained on probation for the 2016-2017
school year in accordance with the terms of that policy.

The Illinois School Code provides that when a school on probation fails to make adequate progress to
correct de?ciencies within one year, the CEO, with the approval of the Board and after an opportunity for a
hearing, may remove and replace the school?s principal. 105 Pursuant to Section 
of the Board's Uniform Principal?s Performance Contract, a principal's contract may be terminated before
the expiration of its four-year term based upon the principal's removal pursuant to Section 

ll. Hearing on Principal Removal

Pursuant to the "Guidelines forthe Removal and Replacement of Principals of Schools on Probation"
and the "Procedures Governing Principal Removal Hearings,? Shaheena Khan, and the Aldridge Local
School Council (LSC) members were duly noti?ed that the CEO was contemplating the removal of Ms.
Khan as principal pursuant to Section to further the school?s educational improvement. Margaret
Fitzpatrick, Esq., an independent hearing of?cer, presided over the Aldridge principal removal hearing on
May 24, and June 9, 2017, in an efficient and impartial manner.

The Law Department representing the CEO, presented the statement and testimony of the former Director
of School Quality Measurement for the Chicago Public Schools, Ryan Crosby, as well as documentation to
support a recommendation to remove Ms. Khan as Aldridge?s principal to the hearing of?cer. Ms. Khan
testified on her own behalfand presented 72 exhibits forthe hearing of?cer?s consideration. Both witnesses
were subject to cross?examination. Both parties were given a full opportunity to call additional witnesses
on their behalf and present additional evidence.

The hearing of?cer submitted a written report on July 17, 2017, summarizing all relevant evidence offered
during the hearing, making ?ndings of fact, and advised the CEO that suf?cient evidence exists to support
the removal of Ms. Khan as me principal of Aldridge. The hearing of?cer allowed the parties to ?le
exceptions to her recommendation. On July 31, 2017, Ms. Khan submitted exceptions to the hearing
officer?s recommendation. I have reviewed those exceptions and taken them into consideration when
making my own recommendation to the Board.

Ill. Chief Executive Officer?s Recommendation

The CEO has reviewed the Hearing Of?cer?s report and the exceptions ?led by Ms. Khan and hereby
recommends that Shaheena Khan be removed'and replaced as the principal of Aldridge effective on August
28,2017. The CEO further recommends that Shaheena Khan's Uniform Principal?s Performance Contract,
with a term beginning Julyr1, 2017, and ending on June 30, 2021, be terminated on August 28, 2017.1
Theserecommendations are based upon the fo i0wing factors:

A. The Board has adopted policies setting forth the criteria for determining when a school is subject to
being placed on probation and when it can be remoVed from that status. The current Board policy is
called the School Quality Rating Policy (or which has been used to- determine. each
school?s accountability status since the 2014-2015 school year, based on 2013-2014 performance
data.

 

1 Ms. Khan?s 8.3 principal removal hearing began while her old Uniform Principal Performance Contract
was in effect, term beginning July 1, 2013, and ending on June 30, 2017. Since that contract has expired,
it is no longer relevant for these proceedings.

August 28, 2017

. Under the SQRP, each Chicago public school receives an annual rating based on its performance

on a variety of measures, including standardized test scores, the culture and climate of the school,
student attendance, and data quality. There are up to nineteen (19) performance measures
evaluated for elementary schools. A school can earn between 1 and 5 points for each measure. The
points earned for each measure are then weighted, with student'g'rowth measures taking on the
most weight in the policy, and then averaged. The resulting overall score will fall between 1 and 5
points. Each school's rating is assigned based on the weighted points earned, as well as its rating
history.

Chicago public schools earning a weighted average of less than 2 points receive a Level 3 rating,
schools receiving between 2 and 2.9 weighted points receive a Level 2 rating,-and schools earning
3 or more weighted points receive a Level Level 1, or Level 1+ rating. Schools earning a Level
3 rating are placed on probation, which is also called ?Intensive Support" status. in'general, schools
receiving a Level 2 rating are placed-in remediation, which is called "Provisional Support", and
schools receiving a 2+ or higher rating are considered in "Good Standing.? 'No'tv'vithstanding these
general rules, in cases where a school has been on probation for two or more consecutive years,
the school must receive a Level 2?or higher rating fortwo consecutive years in order to be eligible
to be removed from that status. 

. Prior to SQRP the District's school accountability policy was called the Performance, Remediation,

and Probation Policy (or .?Perforrnance Policy?), and was in place starting in the 2008-2009 school
year, based on school performance in the 2007-2008 school year. Under the Performance Policy,
points were received for the school?s absolute level of performance and improvement over time on
standardized tests and attendance, as well as the growth of individual students from year?to?year on
the state test. There were 14 separate measures on which schools were evaluated, each worth up
to three points, for a total of 42 available points. Elementary schools that received less than 50% of
the total available points earned a rating of Level 3 and were placed on probation.

Aldridge has a history of poor performance. Aldridge has been on probation for the past ten (10)
consecutive school years. Ms. Khan has been the principal of Aldridge beginning on July 1, 2013.

Under the Board?s Performance Policy, Aldridge received a Level 3 rating each year between 2008?
2009 and 2013?2014, or for six (6) consecutive years. Under SQRP, Aldridge received a Level 3
rating in the 2014-2015 and 2015?2016 school years and received a Level 2 rating in the 2016-2017 
school year based on 2015-2016 performance data. Although Level 2 ratings are generally
associated with remediation status, Aldridge was not eligible to be removed from probation because

it has been on probation for two or more consecutive years and has not yet received a Level 2 rating
for two consecutive years. 

. Aldridge's National School Growth Percentile has been below national average in two of the last,
three years in reading and in all three years in mathematics. Its reading growth percentile was the
percentile in 2013?2014,25?? percentile in 2014-2015, and the {-38'h percentile in 2015-2016

Reading growth in the 2015-2016 school year was highly variable between grade levels, ranging
from a low of percentile In 3"1 grade to 99?" percentile in 4th and 8*h grades. in math, the Aldridge
received 14th percentile in 2013-2014, 25th percentile in 2014-2015, and 14?? percentile in 2015-
2016. In mathematics, growth was below average in each grade level.

. Aldridge?s National School Attainment Percentile in reading has been no higher than the E51h
percentile over the lastfour years In mathematics, Aldridges National School Attainment Percentile
has not been above the 2"?1 percentile In the last four years. These scores are all well below national

average performance .

In addition to standardized test scores, the SQRP evaluates schools on measures of attendance
rate and-school culture and climate. The attendance rate for Aldridge has been consistently lower
than the District average and. has declined in recent years. Between the 2005-2006 and 2012?201 3
school years, the attendance rate at Aldridge ranged between 92. 2% and 93. but has been
below 92% for the last three years, including a low of 90. 4% in 2014-2015. Over that same time
period, district-wide elementary school attendance grew from 94. In 2005-2005 to 95. 5% In 2015-
2016.

To measure school culture and climate, CPS administers in partnership with the Consortium on
Chicago School Research-at the University of Chicago the My Voice, My School 5Essentials
survey. Aldridge received the lowest rating category on the 5Es?sentials survey, which is Not Yet
Organized, the lowest overall category. The school?s rating for the Collaborative Teachers and
Involved Families essentials was Neutral. Its rating for the Ambitious Instruction and Supportive
Environment essentials was Weak. Most notably, the school?s rating for the Effective Leaders
essential was Very Weak, the IoWest rating

Additionally, Aldridge is also at the bottom of Network 13 elementary schools for SQRP ratings.
During the 2015?2016 school year, Aldridge ranked last with a 1.8 SQRP rating out of the 31
elementary schools in Network 13. Similarly, at the beginning of the 2016-2017 school year,
Aldridge Is ranked last with a 2.1 SQRP rating out of the 29 elementary schools In Network 13.

August 28, 2017

L. Aldridge had an approved 2014-2015 Continuous Improvement Work Plan (previously
referred to as a School Improvement Plan). The 2014-2015 CIWP for Aldridge has speci?c steps
that the Aldridge local school council and school staff must take to correct theidentified de?ciencies
and speci?c objective criteria by which the Aldridge school's subsequent progress would be
determined. Unfortunately, the Aldridge 2014~2016 goals for SQRP scores were not met in
most categories.

M. The budget for Aldridge during the 2016 ?scal year totaled nearly $2 million dollars. The Aldridge
2016 ?scal year school budget did include speci?c expenditures directly calculated to correct
educational and operational de?ciencies as identi?ed by the school administration and others.
These expenditures included, but were not limited to, the following:

1). $11,715.00 from Title 1 Of?ce Of Strategic School Support Services for the purpose of
additional teacher professional development training; and

2) $25,000.00 from Title 1 .School Improvement Priority Initiatives for reading and/or math
programming.

N. The accountability notices were sent to Ms. Khan and she knew or should have known about the
academic status of Aldridge.

O. Aldridge did not make adequate progress in correcting those identi?ed de?ciencies. .

P. The removal and replacement of Ms. Khan from Aldridge will assist the school in making adequate
progress in correcting those identi?ed de?ciencies.

If the Board adopts the recommendation to remove the Aldridge principal, the following actions will

occur:

1. The CEO will appoint an interim principal for Aldridge. The interim principal will serve at the
pleasure of the 

2. The LSC shall have no authority to select a new four-year contract principal until Aldridge makes
suf?cient academic progress to be removed from probation; and

3. The Uniform Principal?s Performance Contract Of Shaheena Khan will be terminated effective
August 28, 2017. .

LSC REVIEW: LSC approval is not applicable to this report.

FINANCIAL: The interim principal position will be ?lled at a cost within current budget

appropriatiOns.

PERSONNEL IMPLICATIONS: An Interim Principal will be selected, who will serve at the pleasure of the
CEO. Until the school comes off probation. the Local School Council of Aldridge will have no authority to
select a new four-year contract principal, as required by Board Policy.

services in the event of unfavorable budget variances. The Board's goal is to have a balanced budget
over the period of the four?year ?nancial plan that is to be'developed.
