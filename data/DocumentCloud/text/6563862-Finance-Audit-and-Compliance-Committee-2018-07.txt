INFORMATION ITEMS

Craig Richmond, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Of?cer provided an overview of the
Second Quarter 2018 Unaudited Financial and Operations Results for the period ended June 30,
2018. Mr. Richmond reported that Adjusted Earnings before Interest, Depreciation and
Amortization for the six months ended June 30, 2018 was $48.4 million, an increase of
$5.7 million or 13.3 percent over the same period in 2017 which had an EBIDA of $42.7 million.
Similar to the prior quarter, EBIDA increase was mainly attributed to growth from emergency
department volumes, patient acuity, surgical volumes, expanded pharmacy operations, and lower
liability insurance costs.

Mr. Richmond further reported that total Operating income for the six months ended June 30, 2018
was $19.0 million, compared with operating income of $15.4 million in the same period of 2017, an
increase of $3.6 million or 24.0 percent.

Total operating revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2018 was $583.5 million as compared to
$554.0 million in the same period of 2017, an increase of 5.3 percent. The revenue growth was
attributable to both an increase in net patient service revenue of $19.5 million or 4.1 percent and an
increase in other operating revenue of $10.0 million or 13.1 percent, mainly driven by growth in
retail and contract pharmacy operations.

The System showed continued growth in the acuity of its inpatient business with the overall case mix
index reported at 1.64 for the six months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to 1.57 for the same
period in 2017. Key drivers of the increased net patient revenue include modest improvement in
payor mix, higher overall acuity of cases, and emergency department and surgical volumes.

Mr. Richmond noted the System recorded total operating expenses of $535.1 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to $511.3 million for the same period in 2017, which is an
increase of $23.8 million or 4.7 percent, comparing favorably to the total operating revenue increase
of $29.5 million. Most of the increase was in salary, wages and bene?ts for additional staff to
accommodate volume growth, purchased services and pharmacy costs associated with the retail
pharmacy expansion.

Mr. Richmond provided a review of the Statement of Net Position as of one 30, 2018 as compared
to December 31, 2017. Areas of note were $12.8 million increase in other receivables due to the
timing of the Hospital Care Assurance Program (HCAP) payments and the Care Innovation and
Community Improvement Program (ii) net capital assets increased $18.6 million due to
costs associated with the View Road parking garage and transformation planning/design services,
and restricted assets under bond indenture agreement decreased $23.8 million from prior year?
end balances due to interest payments and Bond Fund draws during the period. Total liabilities
decreased by $14.5 million which was mainly due to the timing of payments for accounts payable,
payroll and professional liability claims.

Michael Stern, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Of?cer provided an overview of the
Operating Performance Volumes for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018
comparing to the same period in 2017. Inpatient discharges were up compared to target and
down to prior year. Overall length of stay has increased and the case mix index (CMI) is up from the
prior year due to patient acuity. Mr. Stern commented that opportunities to reduce the length of stay
will continue to be an area of focus. Life Flight transports have been on target for the period but
down compared to last year. Other volumes of note were that outpatient visits were down,
surgical volumes continued to show growth due to outpatient cases over prior year, as well as
emergency department visits, and FTEs were on target.

Mr. Richmond reviewed Unrestricted Cash and Investment balances, noting that the second quarter
of 2018 was down compared to December 31, 2017 due to the timing of HCAP and UPL
Supplemental payments and advance payment of the Inter-Governmental Transfer (IGT) for the
CICIP. Regarding MetroHealth?s bond covenants and rating agency median ratios? the System?s
bond covenants (days cash on hand and minimum debt service coverage ratio) are within
compliance. Lastly, the Advisory Board Credit Rating Strength Diagnostic Tool which measures the
system?s financial metrics against benchmarks derived from hospital medians of the major credit
rating agencies was referenced, as well as the Capital Budget Summary.

Jeff Kerkay, Treasurer provided an update and overview of the MetroHealth Investment Policy and
Implementation Strategy. Discussion outlined Hartland, MetroHealth?s Investment Advisers for the
investment of the System?s Qualifying Funds in accordance with the Ohio Revised Code and their
approach and portfolio structure.

Geoff Himes, Vice President of Finance provided a review and update of GASB Statement No. 75
Accounting and Financial Reporting for Other Postemployment Bene?ts (OPEB). GASB 75
which is similar to GASB 68, will be recorded annually using results from the OPERS actuary
reports. The System is required to implement the provisions of the Statement for fiscal year end
December 31, 2018. Mr. Himes also briefly discussed GASB Statement No. 87 Leases, and
GASB Statement No. 89 - Accounting for Interest Costs Incurred Before the End of a Construction
Period. These two statements will be effective for ?scal year ended December 31, 2020.
