 Ms. Feke informed members that in 2018, Geauga County received $76,000 in underserved funds
with the remaining amount split between the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority
(GCRTA) and Laketran. Ms. Feke stated that there is $455,010 available in underserved fund
this year. She said Transit Council needs to take action at this meeting so the underserved funds
can be distributed to the transit agencies.
Ms. Amy Snell presented a spreadsheet showing the apportionments for the transit agencies in
the NOACA region. She mentioned that Brunswick Transit Alternative (BTA) no longer receives
apportionments and its funds have been combined with the funds for Medina County Public
Transit (MCPT).
Mr. Shannon Rine asked if funds for BTA and MCPT were combined into one allocation. Ms. Snell
said yes. Mr. Rine asked when the funds were combined. Ms. Snell said the funds were
combined this year.
Dr. Caver asked what areas are unserved and how the underserved area funds are used.
Ms. Snell stated that the unserved areas are Geauga, Lorain and Ashtabula counties that are
categorized under the U.S. Census that is considered urbanized but does not have a transit
agency that serves those areas. Ms. Feke said there are no FTA regulations that require
underserved funds to be used a certain way and that it was up to the Transit Council to make that
decision. She noted that everything so far has been approved by FTA.
Dr. Caver asked what would happen to the underserved funds if they are not allocated by the
Transit Council at this meeting. Ms. Feke said nothing would happen. Dr. Caver asked if the
transit agencies will get the money back. Ms. Feke said no, and noted that if the funds are not
allocated, FTA would eventually ask if the funds will be used.
Mr. Jackson stated that GCT will be using Trapeze PASS scheduling and dispatching software in
coordination with Laketran. He asked that the software licensing fee be directed to Laketran.
Ms. Aaby said Laketran supports its partnership with GCT and approves funneling $76,000 to
GCT to pay for Trapeze PASS. She suggested that the remaining underserved funds be split
80/20 between GCRTA and Laketran.
A motion was made by Mr. Jackson and seconded by Ms. Aaby to approve the following allocation
split of underserved funds:

RE:

Fiscal Year 2019 UZA Federal Apportionments

ACTION REQUESTED
The Council is asked to affirm the electronic vote taken on June 14, 2019 via email to approve the adjusted
amount of the allocation of the FY2019 Cleveland UZA Federal Apportionments.
BACKGROUND
Each year, Congress passes legislation which, when signed by the President, appropriates funds for the
Department of Transportation and related agencies. After that legislation is enacted, FTA publishes a Notice
in the Federal Register that provides an overview of the apportionments and allocations based on these
funds for the various Federal Transit Administration programs as well as statements of policy and guidance
on public transit administration.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The change from the prior UZA allocation of $28,367,835 to the adjusted amount of $28,364,333. The
difference is $3,502 in which GCRTA and Laketran agreed to decrease from their initial allocation.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
GCRTA will finalize the full year allocation of FY 2019 Section 5307 and Section 5339 funding to transit
operators in the Cleveland Urbanized Area.

RE:

Project Planning Reviews (PPRs)/ Intergovernmental Review and Consultation
(IGRC); 2nd Quarter State Fiscal Year 2020

ACTION REQUESTED
No action is requested at this time. This item is included for information and presentation.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION
Attached are PPR summary documents for the proposed projects to be presented to the NOACA
Transportation Subcommittee, Planning and Programming Committee and Executive Committee for review
and recommendation.
NOACA’s Board approved Regional Transportation Investment Policy requires that all proposed federal-aid
transportation projects be processed through PPR in order to meet NOACA’s adopted goals and federal
requirements.
PPR consists of four levels of review: NOACA staff; Board, including committees, subcommittees, and
Councils; intergovernmental review and consultation (IGRC); and public involvement. The end product of
PPR is a Board resolution that certifies that the project has had thorough review, allowing the project to
proceed to the programming stages of the planning process.
As part of the PPR process, a detailed summary of the proposed improvement and staff and committee
assessment of the project are posted on NOACA’s website, www.NOACA.org. A link to the PPRs is
included on the home page by clicking the ‘Comment on Projects’ button. Staff adds comments obtained
from the public, governmental organizations and NOACA committees as they are received. Proposed
projects are posted on the website for three months, allowing adequate time for review and comment.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Pending Board approval, the project sponsor will be notified that their project has completed PPR. NOACA
staff will work with the project sponsor to address any planning issues identified during PPR.

 RTA Fiscal Year 2020 Capital Grant Program
Sponsor: RTA
Estimated Total Cost: $54,519,373
Proposed Source of Federal Funds: Federal Transit Administration (FTA)
History/Background: RTA reports that its original state fiscal year (SFY) 2020 grant program is
listed in the NOACA SFY 2018 – 2021 Transportation Improvement Program and the majority of
the program is as originally proposed in the TIP. RTA is adding four new projects to its FFY 2020
program and the TIP. RTA is also seeking to revise and amend five existing grants to address
under-runs, over-runs, and revised priorities in its capital program impacting eleven TIP projects.
RTA’s revisions to the FFY 2019 and 2017 Capital Formula and FFY 2016 State of Good Repair
grant programs reflect these revisions.
Proposed Project: RTA is applying for various sources of funds including Section 5307 Capital
Formula, Section 5337 State of Good Repair Formula and Section 5339 Bus and Bus Facilities
Formula for FFY 2020, as described below:
•

The Section 5307 Capital Formula projects include Bus Replacement Program Vehicles
and Spare Parts, Substation Improvement Program, Cuyahoga Viaduct Track Bridge, Light
Rail Track Rehabilitation, Bus Spare Parts Program, Rail State of Good Repair, Bus
Preventive Maintenance, Enhanced Rail ADA (Americans with Disabilities) Access, NOACA
Unserved Areas Projects, (new) Rail Car Replacement Program, (new) Track Bridge over
Conrail and (new) HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) System Improvement
Program.

•

Section 5337 Rail Formula projects include Substation Improvement Program, Cuyahoga
Viaduct Track Bridge, Light Rail Track Rehabilitation, Rail Spare Parts Program, Rail State
of Good Repair Projects, Rail Preventive Maintenance, Rail Infrastructure Program, On-Call
Rail Engineering, OCS (Overhead Catenary System) Rehabilitation Program and (new) Rail
Utility Vehicle Prime Mover Replacement.

•

Section 5339 Bus and Bus Facilities Formula projects include Bus Replacement Program
Vehicles and Spare Parts.

RTA is also seeking to revise and amend five existing grants to address updated funding amounts,
projected under-runs, over-runs and revised priorities in its Capital Program as described below:
•

2019 Section 5307 Capital Formula Grant – The grant is being revised and amended to
account for decreased funding as well as to decrease Bus Preventive Maintenance and
NOACA Unserved Area funding, shift Bus Vehicle Type funding, fund the West 117th Street
Track Bridge and its Rail Car Replacement Program.

•

2019 Section 5337 State of Good Repair Formula Grant – The grant is being revised and
amended to account for decreased funding as well as to decrease Rail Preventive
Maintenance and West 117th Street Track Bridge funding and fund the Rail Car
Replacement Program.

•

2019 Section 5339 Bus and Bus Facilities Formula Grant – The grant is being revised and
amended to account for increased funding and to increase the funding for Bus
Replacement Program Vehicles.

 •

2017 Section 5307 Capital Formula Grant – The grant is being revised and amended to
account for separating the design and construction phase costs for Light Rail Signal
System, from East 79th Street to Shaker Square.

•

2016 Section 5337 State of Good Repair Grant - The grant is being revised and amended
due to under-runs in the West Park Diamond Crossover and Red Line West Track
Rehabilitation projects and to fund the (new) Rail Utility Vehicle Prime Mover Replacement.

Program Update

ACTION REQUESTED
No action is requested at this time. This item is included for information and presentation.
BACKGROUND
The Enhanced Mobility for Seniors and Individuals with Disabilities (Section 5310) Program addresses the
special transportation needs of seniors and individuals with disabilities. NOACA seeks to eliminate barriers
and improve transportation options in Northeast Ohio for older adults, individuals with disabilities, and
people of low income through the coordination of resources and efforts of public transit operators, human
service agencies, and other transportation providers. Furthermore, NOACA will encourage the efficient and
effective use of resources by eliminating gaps and redundancies in transportation services.
The total amount apportioned to the region for federal fiscal year 2019 was $ 1,809,255, of which $ 180,925
(10%) will be retained by NOACA for program planning and administration. The remaining $ 1,628,330 is
available to be programmed for new capital project recommendations. Capital projects are funded at 80%
with a 20% local match from awardees. NOACA has designated at least 60% of funding for transit agency
project proposals and up to 40% for non-profits, for-profits, and government agencies awarded through a
competitive application process. Transit agencies are eligible for operations funding at 50% federal funding
with a 50% local match.
