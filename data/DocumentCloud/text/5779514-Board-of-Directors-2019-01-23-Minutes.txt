PROJECTS
Brush Park South: Brownfield Redevelopment Plan
Mr. Vosburg presented the Brownfield Plan for the Brush Park South project.

 Project Introduction
Brush Park South Phase I MR LLC is the project developer (the “Developer”) for the Plan which
entails a comprehensive, mixed-use redevelopment of the site. The redevelopment, Brush Park
South, is planned to consist of three mixed-income apartments buildings that will include
approximately 149 apartments and 600 square feet of retail space. Approximately 58 apartments
will be rented as affordable apartments with rents restricted and otherwise subject to various
requirements to assure their occupancy by residents who satisfy affordable housing criteria.
Twenty-nine of the affordable units will use project-based vouchers through the Detroit Housing
Commission and the other 29 affordable units will use Low Income Housing Tax Credits. A portion
of the remainder of the Property will be used for parking that will remain in place indefinitely for
use by tenants of the new apartment buildings as well as additional parking that will be available
until alternative, permanent alternative parking becomes available either on the east side of Brush
or at other locations. It is expected that the alternative parking will not be available for at least
several years.
The total investment is estimated to be $37 million. The Developer is requesting $5,273,310.00
in TIF reimbursement.
There will be 250 temporary construction jobs and 4-6 FTE jobs. The 250 temporary construction
jobs are expected to be created over a 2-year period once construction begins. The 4-6 FTE jobs
will be related to property management. An unknown number of jobs are expected to be created
by one or more businesses that located in the retail component of the project.

due to the presence of metals, PNAs, PCBs soil and fill or adjacent and contiguous to a facility

completed within 3 years after approval of the Michigan Strategic Fund work plan, if applicable,
or three years after execution of the Reimbursement Agreement.

Land Assembly Project: Engagement of Firm for Soil Removal
Mr. Robertson presented the Land Assembly Project: Engagement of Firm for Soil removal to
the DBRA Board.
As the Board is aware, the City of Detroit administration has requested the assistance of the City
of Detroit Brownfield Redevelopment Authority (“DBRA”) in industrial land assembly activities
aimed at establishing market-ready industrial sites within City limits in order to attract
manufacturing and logistics companies (the “Land Assembly Project”). On October 24, 2018
(DBRA 18-10-262-01) and November 7, 2018 (DBRA 18-10-262-02) the Board approved certain
initial steps in connection with the Land Assembly Project, including the allocation and acceptance
of a total of $10 Million in initial funds for the Land Assembly Project, which funds were expected
to be reimbursed by the City.

 In connection with the Land Assembly Project, the DBRA has solicited bids from select contractors
to remove soil from selected sites and received bids from six contractors. From these bids, DBRA
staff has selected Angelo Iafrate Construction Company (the “Contractor”) as the lowest, most
responsive bidder.
The Contractor will be performing the following scope: permits, soil erosion controls, grubbing,
debris removal, underground storage tank removal and closure, removal of above grade and
below grade soils, backfill to grade with clean fill, as well as a 25% contingency. The total board
authorized amount for this contract will be $2,500,512.00.
A resolution approving and authorizing the DBRA to enter into a contract with Angelo Iafrate
Construction Company, for the above described services and authorized amount, to be paid from
the $10 million in funds from the City, is attached for your review and consideration.
Ms. DeSantis stated that it would be helpful to be able to see all firms that submitted a bid for
contracts and asked if any of the firms that bid for this contract were headquartered in the City of
Detroit. Mr. Dailey stated that the selected Contractor is not headquartered in the City of Detroit
but has provided a letter stated that it will comply with the Executive Orders of the City of Detroit.
Mr. Robertson stated that other three firms that bid for the contract are headquartered in the City
of Detroit: Homrich, Blaze, and Adamo Group.
Ms. DeSantis stated that the DBRA should support firms that are located in the City of Detroit, as
well as minority-owned firms and that the Contractor should move its operations into the City of
Detroit.
Mr. Walters called for approving the Land Assembly Project: Engagement of Firm for Soil
Removal as presented. The Board took the following action:
On a motion by Mr. Scott, seconded by Mr. Gonzalez, DBRA Resolution Code 19-01-26207 was approved. Ms. DeSantis abstained.
ADMINISTRATIVE
EPA Assessment Grant Coalition
Mr. Vosburg presented the EPA Assessment Grant Coalition to the DBRA Board.
The DBRA staff was recently notified that the EPA has opened a new round of applications in
connection with the EPA Brownfield Assessment grant program. Based on the overwhelming
demand for Brownfield Assessment grants experienced the past several years, DBRA staff
believe that it would be beneficial to apply for a new round of funding.
DBRA staff spoke with Wayne County Brownfield Redevelopment Authority (WCBRA) and the
Detroit/Wayne County Port Authority (DWCPA) to review last year’s application and inquire if
there would be interest in a new coalition grant application. WCBRA staff, the lead applicant of
last year’s unsuccessful grant application, met with EPA staff to review the application and learned
that it was very close to being selected. WCBRA staff are proposing to submit a similar coalition
grant application as last year with edits and updates based on feedback from EPA staff.
As you may remember the WCBRA and DWCPA were part of a previous successful
environmental site assessment application in conjunction with the City of Detroit’s Building, Safety
Engineering & Environment Department (BSEED) that successfully completed obligating and
expending all of its funds. Because of this prior success, the staffs of DBRA and the DWCPA

 have agreed that the WCBRA will again be the lead applicant on the grant application and be
responsible for administration of the funds if the coalition successfully receives the grant. By
applying as a coalition, the DBRA is able to increase the maximum allowable grant from $200,000
to $600,000, take advantage of and learn from the DWCPA’s experience and relationships with
the EPA, as well as play a direct role in marketing the funds and selection of projects to receive
the funds.
A resolution authorizing the DBRA to join the coalition and supporting the EPA grant application
is attached for your review and approval, as well as a sample letter from the DBRA for the grant
application.
Mr. Walters called for approving the EPA Assessment Grant Coalition as presented. The Board
took the following action:
On a motion by Ms. Wilkins, seconded by Ms. McClain, DBRA Resolution Code 19-01-01209 was unanimously approved.
Expenditures Report Under Delegation of Authority
Mr. Vosburg presented the Expenditures Report Under Delegation of Authority to the DBRA
