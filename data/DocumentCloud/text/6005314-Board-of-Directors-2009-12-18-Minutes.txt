IV. Report from Chief Executive Officer (continued)
A. Strategic Plan update
Mr. Foley provided an update on strategic planning efforts. He presented an overview of the next steps
and a timetable for the strategic plan process (Attachment #3). He is recommending that the contract with
Integrated Clinical Solutions be extended in order to continue with the next steps; he expects this proposed
contract extension to be on the Finance Committee’s agenda for their January meeting.
Mr. Foley introduced Salim Al-Nurridin, of the Healthcare Consortium of Illinois, who presented a report
on the strategic planning town hall meetings (Attachment #4). Mr. Al-Nurridin provided an overview, and
discussed the input received as a result of these activities and meetings.
Mr. Foley stated that a preliminary meeting was held last week with Dr. Lorrie Jones, who is the Director
of the Division of Mental Health for the Illinois Department of Human Services. He stated that the State
is interested in discussing the possibility of doing something on the Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County
campus. He noted that they have a facility in Tinley Park that is closing. The first alternative proposed is
to pay for patient days for the State’s mental health patients in the System’s facility. The second
alternative proposed is to lease space in a unit at Oak Forest Hospital, where they would provide the
services. Mr. Foley stated that there has been only one meeting on the subject; they will be following up
to study this possibility further.
The Board discussed the subject. Chairman Batts noted that input received from the town hall meetings
indicates that there is a great need for mental health services in the community. In response to a question
from Director O’Donnell regarding whether the System has the capability to staff the type of services that
would be necessary under the first option, Mr. Foley responded that, with the exception of Cermak Health
Services, the System does not currently provide inpatient psychiatric services. Mr. Foley stated that he
prefers the second option, in which the State leases space at Oak Forest Hospital and provides their own
services to their patients.

B. Introduction of new Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Terry Mason
Mr. Foley introduced and welcomed the new Chief Medical Officer for the System, Dr. Terry Mason.
C. Progress Report on Facilities Planning Board Settlement Agreement for Project #94-072
Prior to this presentation, Director Carvalho stated for the record that he is a member of the Health
Facilities Planning Board, so he has abstained from anything relating to this subject when it came before
the Health Facilities Planning Board or the System Board.
Randall Mark, Director of Intergovernmental Affairs and Policy for the Cook County Health and Hospitals
System, presented a progress report on the Facilities Planning Board Settlement Agreement for Project
#94-072 (Attachment #5). He noted that the Health Facilities Planning Board is now known as the Health
Facilities and Services Review Board. He provided an overview of the history surrounding the subject,
and reviewed the progress that has taken place.
Director Greenspan inquired whether a recent response has been received from the State. Mr. Mark
responded that an email response to the May report was received, and he has had a verbal conversation
with staff on the November report.

highlighted several subjects; these subjects included progress on service integration, work on drafting a single
set of System By-Laws, approval of the 2010 System Quality Plan, efforts towards Cermak’s reaccreditation,
and physician productivity benchmarking.
The Board and Mr. Foley thanked Dr. Raba for his hard work as the Cook County Health and Hospitals
System’s first Chief Medical Officer. Chairman Batts requested that a resolution be drafted for the Board’s
meeting in January in honor of Dr. Raba.

Board and Committee Reports
A. Minutes of the Board of Directors Meeting, November 19, 2009
During the presentation of these minutes, Director Carvalho referenced a discussion at that meeting
relating to the System’s mandatory policy on employee H1N1 immunizations. He asked if an update could
be provided.
Mr. Foley responded that as of December 17, 2009, 51% of the System’s total employees have received
the vaccination. Following is data relating to specific affiliate employee vaccination totals: John H.
Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County-48%; Cermak Health Services-75%; Cook County Department of
Public Health-79%; Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County-46%; Provident Hospital of Cook County-60%.
Dr. Stephen Martin, Chief Operating Officer of the Cook County Department of Public Health, provided
additional information. He stated that, due to the shortage/delivery slowdown, the date by which all
employees must receive the vaccine has been extended to March 1, 2010; the goal for March 1st is 100%
compliance with this policy. He noted that the data presented needs to be adjusted for those exempted
from the policy due to medical contraindications.
Director Ansell stated that similar delivery issues have been experienced at Rush, specifically with regard
to seasonal flu vaccines. He suggested that the Quality and Patient Safety Committee discuss and track the
subject further and in more detail.
Vice Chairman Ramirez referenced a recent H1N1 vaccine recall, and asked if that recall affected the
System. Dr. Martin responded that the System did not receive any of that lot number which was recalled.
Director Butler, seconded by Director O’Donnell, moved the approval of the minutes of the Board of
Directors Meeting of November 19, 2009. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

Proposed redevelopment of the historic Cook County Hospital Main Building for System
administrative offices

Director Carvalho, seconded by Director Butler, moved the approval of the minutes of the Finance
Committee Meeting of December 11, 2009.
During Director Carvalho’s presentation of the minutes, a discussion was held on the request to amend
and increase the contract with the Oland Group, for assistance with the coordination and management
of all existing and planned consulting contracts, and for further review of the System for opportunities
for consolidation, standardization and additional performance improvement opportunities. Mr. Foley
provided additional information on the request. He stated that this will extend the contract through
September 2010 for Jeanene Johnson, Director of the Office of Performance Improvement, and
includes the provision of three additional staff. Director Ansell stated that it would be useful to more
fully understand Ms. Johnson’s role from a programmatic standpoint at a future meeting.
The Board held an extensive discussion on the proposed redevelopment of the historic Cook County
Hospital Main Building for System administrative offices.
Director Carvalho provided a brief summary of the item, noting that the County Board is seeking the
System Board’s input and advice on the proposal; he stated that he believes that the final decision rests
with the County Board. At the December 11th Finance Committee meeting, he requested additional
information on the System’s space needs, as he believes that the System’s needs should be examined
before a location or building is chosen. Information has been provided in response to that request.
Director Butler stated for the record that he strongly objects to the expenditure of $24 million on the
re-use of the old Cook County Hospital Building, and indicated that he would be voting no on the
proposal. He stated his reasons for his objection - he believes that the redevelopment of the building
has nothing to do with the mission of the Cook County Health and Hospitals System, and feels that
spending $24 million to rehabilitate the existing building is a waste of money.

VI. Board and Committee Reports (continued)
E. Minutes of the Finance Committee Meeting, December 11, 2009 (continued)
Director Ansell stated that he would also be voting no on the proposal, and suggested that the item be
divided from the report and voted upon separately.
Director Carvalho, seconded by Director Greenspan, moved to amend the motion, to approve the minutes
of the Finance Committee Meeting of December 11, 2009, with the exception of the Finance Committee’s
recommendation on the item relating to the proposed redevelopment of the Cook County Hospital Main
Building for System administrative offices. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
Director Carvalho, seconded by Director Ansell, moved the approval of the Finance Committee’s
recommendation on the item relating to the proposed redevelopment of the Cook County Hospital Main
Building for System administrative offices.
The Board continued their discussion of the item.
Vice Chairman Ramirez stated that he thought this was a Cook County Board issue. Bruce
Washington, Director of Cook County’s Office of Capital Planning and Policy, confirmed that the
decision lies with the County Board. However, a formal acknowledgement that System administrative
staff will relocate into that building is being requested from the System Board. He continued, noting
that if the System Board chose to not relocate their staff in that building, the next phase would be to
find lease space to house staff currently located in the Polk Building, because the Polk Building is
slated for demolition.
In response to questions relating to the specific request before the Board, it was clarified that, if the
System Board approves the Finance Committee’s recommendation on the item, the System Board
acknowledges that it will relocate its administrative staff and personnel from the 1900 West Polk
Building to the redeveloped Cook County Hospital Building upon completion.
Director Carvalho noted that the 2005 Master Plan stated that 500,000 square feet was needed; the old
Cook County Hospital Building is only 300,000 square feet. He inquired whether the needs have
changed. If these needs have not changed, are there other plans to locate 200,000 square feet that the
old Hospital Building will not be able to provide?
Mr. Washington stated that the System needs about 300,000 square feet. He stated that the 2005
Master Plan was the first plan that was done. There have been two additional studies done since then;
one study was done by his office in 2007 that spoke to the relocation to that building. The building is
large enough, but not too large, to house the entire staff currently housed at the Polk Building.
Discussion continued regarding the number of staff currently housed at the Polk Building; Mr. Foley
confirmed that the total number of staff housed at the Polk Building is nine hundred.
Chairman Batts stated that the Polk Building needs to be replaced. Whatever the County provides,
whether it is new or rehabilitated, that has adequate space and is contiguous to the System’s
operations, he believes the System staff would need to move there.
Mr. Foley stated that from a management perspective, the Polk Building is going to be torn down, so
staff has to move somewhere. One concern he had was whether the old hospital building can be
retrofitted for quality office space, and his other concern related to whether there would be sufficient
space. The information provided has addressed these concerns, and he believes that it is a reasonable
alternative.

VI. Board and Committee Reports (continued)
E. Minutes of the Finance Committee Meeting, December 11, 2009 (continued)
Director Ansell referenced the comments made by Director Butler regarding the cost for rehabilitation
of the old building. He indicated that the question surrounding the replacement of Fantus Clinic
should be a higher priority than this issue.
Hugh Murphy, of Jones Lang LaSalle, provided information on the cost projections for new
construction and rehabilitation of the existing building. The additional cost to rehabilitate the old
building ($24 million cost referenced by Director Butler) would be offset by TIF funds that would only
be available for redevelopment. As a result of this, the cost to the County would be generally the same
for either option.
Director O’Donnell stated that she has a problem with the idea of tapping into other public resources
that may be available; she stated that she doesn’t think that is acting fiscally responsible.
On the motion to approve the Finance Committee’s recommendation on the item relating to the proposed
redevelopment of the historic Cook County Hospital Main Building for System administrative offices, a roll
call was taken at the request of Director Butler, the votes of yeas and nays being as follows:
Yeas:

Nays:

Directors Ansell, Butler, Golden, Greenspan and O’Donnell (5)

Present:

THE MOTION FAILED.
Mr. Foley suggested that a motion be made that states, while the Board doesn’t agree with the concept
or cost of saving the old building, if the County Board agrees to do it, the System Board will be
agreeable to move into a new or rehabilitated building. Additionally, Mr. Foley stated that he will
provide to the Board more detailed information on which staff and departments are currently housed in
the Polk Building.
Director Muñoz, seconded by Director O’Donnell, made the following motion: With reservations on saving
the old Cook County Hospital Building, and noting that the System Board is not in agreement with the
proposed redevelopment of the old Cook County Hospital Building, nevertheless, the System Board agrees to
move System administrative offices into any building on the Stroger Campus.
A roll call was taken, the votes of yeas and nays being as follows:

E. Minutes of the Finance Committee Meeting, December 11, 2009 (continued)
Chairman Batts, seconded by Director Ansell, made the following motion: the System Board urges the
County Board to move as expeditiously as possible to rebuild the Fantus Clinic and complete the parking
garage, in order to serve patients more quickly and effectively.
Mr. Foley noted that regardless of the outcome of this issue, work on the parking garage continues;
groundbreaking is scheduled for the second quarter of 2010. Additionally, with regard to Fantus Clinic, he
suggested that the outcome of the strategic plan will determine the location and substance of Fantus Clinic.
Following discussion, Chairman Batts withdrew his motion.

F. Minutes of the Audit and Compliance Committee Meeting, December 11, 2009
Director Muñoz, seconded by Director Lyne, moved the approval of the minutes of the Audit and
Compliance Committee Meeting of December 11, 2009. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

VII. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
A. Update on Contract Compliance activities
Betty Hancock Perry, Director of the Cook County Office of Contract Compliance, provided an update on
contract compliance activities. During her presentation, she noted that they are in the process of
implementing a software system that will assist in tracking contracts from beginning to end. She also
noted that over the past two months, her office has conducted workshops for minority and women
vendors, putting these vendors in the same room with group purchasing organizations (GPOs).
Director Carvalho noted that for previous years, it has been difficult to segregate the System contracts
from the rest of the County contracts, in order to review and compare the participation efforts from year to
year. Ms. Hancock Perry responded that in previous years, all of the participation effort data was
compiled collectively; however, now System contracts are reviewed and the data is compiled separately
from the other County contracts. After further discussion, Ms. Hancock Perry stated that her office can
manually collect the participation data from 2008, so a comparison can be made to the 2009 data.

B. Proposed 2010 Meeting Dates for the Human Resources Committee
Director Ansell, seconded by Vice Chairman Ramirez, moved the approval of the proposed 2010 meeting
dates for the Human Resources Committee (Attachment #7).

Health Reform

H>9:"7N"H>9: 8DBE6G>HDC D; B6?DG =:6AI= 86G: G:;DGB EGDEDH6AH
Comprehensive health reform legislation is currently being debated in Congress. On November 7, 2009, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Affordable Health Care for
America Act and the U.S. Senate introduced the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act on November 18, 2009. The following summaries of these bills focus on provisions to expand
health care coverage, control health care costs, and improve the health care delivery system. These summaries will be updated to reflect changes made during the legislative process.
House Leadership Bill
Affordable Health Care for America Act (H.R. 3962)

Senate Leadership Bill
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (H.R. 3590)

Date plan announced

October 29, 2009 (passed by the House November 7, 2009)

November 18, 2009

Overall approach
to expanding access
to coverage

Require most individuals to have health insurance. Create a Health
Insurance Exchange through which individuals and smaller employers
can purchase health coverage, with premium and cost-sharing credits
available to individuals/families with incomes up to 400% of the federal
poverty level (the poverty level is $18,310 for a family of three in 2009).
Require employers to provide coverage to employees or pay into a
Health Insurance Exchange Trust Fund, with exceptions for certain small
employers, and provide certain small employers a credit to offset the costs
of providing coverage. Impose new regulations on plans participating in the
Exchange and in the small group insurance market. Expand Medicaid to
150% of the poverty level.

Require most U.S. citizens and legal residents to have health insurance.
Create state-based American Health Benefit Exchanges through which
individuals can purchase coverage, with premium and cost-sharing credits
available to individuals/families with income between 100-400% of the
federal poverty level (the poverty level is $18,310 for a family of three in
2009) and create separate Exchanges through which small businesses
can purchase coverage. Require employers to pay penalties for employees
who receive tax credits for health insurance through an Exchange, with
exceptions for small employers. Impose new regulations on health plans
in the Exchanges and in the individual and small group markets. Expand
Medicaid to 133% of the federal poverty level.

Individual mandate

• Require individuals to have “acceptable health coverage”. Those without
coverage pay a penalty of 2.5% of their adjusted income above the filing
threshold up to the cost of the average national premium for self-only
or family coverage under a basic plan in the Health Insurance Exchange.
Exceptions granted for those with incomes below the filing threshold
(in 2009 the threshold for taxpayers under age 65 is $9,350 for singles
and $18,700 for couples), religious objections and financial hardship.
(Effective January 1, 2013)

• Require U.S. citizens and legal residents to have qualifying health
coverage. Those without coverage pay a tax penalty of $750 per year
up to a maximum of three times that amount ($2,250) per family. The
penalty will be phased-in according to the following schedule: $95
in 2014; $350 in 2015; and $750 in 2016. Beginning after 2016, the
penalty will be increased annually by the cost-of-living adjustment.
Exemptions will be granted for financial hardship, religious objections,
American Indians, those without coverage for less than three months,
undocumented immigrants, incarcerated individuals, if the lowest cost
plan option exceeds 8% of an individual’s income, and if the individual has
income below 100% of the poverty level.

Employer requirements

• Require employers to offer coverage to their employees and contribute
at least 72.5% of the premium cost for single coverage and 65% of the
premium cost for family coverage of the lowest cost plan that meets the
essential benefits package requirements or pay 8% of payroll into the
Health Insurance Exchange Trust Fund. (Effective January 1, 2013)

• Assess employers with more than 50 employees that do not offer
coverage and have at least one full-time employee who receives a
premium tax credit a fee of $750 per full-time employee. Employers
with more than 50 employees that offer coverage but have at least one
full-time employee receiving a premium tax credit, will pay the lesser of
$3,000 for each employee receiving a premium credit or $750 for each
full-time employee. For employers that impose a waiting period before

(continued)

Expansion of public
programs

House Leadership Bill
Affordable Health Care for America Act (H.R. 3962)

Senate Leadership Bill
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (H.R. 3590)

• Eliminate or reduce the pay or play assessment for small employers with
annual payroll of less than $750,000:
– Annual payroll less than $500,000: exempt
– Annual payroll between $500,000 and $585,000: 2% of payroll;
– Annual payroll between $585,000 and $670,000: 4% of payroll;
– Annual payroll between $670,000 and $750,000: 6% of payroll.
(Effective January 1, 2013)
• Require employers that offer coverage to automatically enroll into the
employer’s lowest cost premium plan any individual who does not elect
coverage under the employer plan or does not opt out of such coverage.
(Effective January 1, 2013)
• Require a government study of the impact of employer responsibility
requirements and recommend to Congress whether an employer
hardship exemption is appropriate. (Report due January 1, 2012)

  employees can enroll in coverage, require payment of $400 for any fulltime employee in a 30-60 day waiting period and $600 for any employee
in a 60-90 day waiting period. (Effective January 1, 2014)
• Exempt employers with 50 or fewer employees from any of the above
penalties.
• Require employers with more than 200 employees to automatically
enroll employees into health insurance plans offered by the employer.
Employees may opt out of coverage.

• Expand Medicaid to all individuals under age 65 (children, pregnant
women, parents, and adults without dependent children) with incomes
up to 150% FPL. Provide Medicaid coverage for all newborns who lack
acceptable coverage and provide optional Medicaid coverage to lowincome HIV-infected individuals (with enhanced matching funds) until
2013 and for family planning services to certain low-income women. In
addition, increase Medicaid payment rates for primary care providers
to 100% of Medicare rates by 2012. Require states to submit a state
plan amendment specifying the payment rates to be paid under the
state’s Medicaid program. The coverage expansions (except the optional
expansions) and the enhanced provider payments will be financed
with 100% federal financing through 2014 and 91% federal financing
beginning in year 2015. (Effective January 1, 2013)
• Repeal the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and require
enrollees in separate state CHIP programs with incomes above 150%
FPL to obtain coverage through the Health Insurance Exchange
beginning in 2014. Children with incomes above 150% of poverty enrolled
in Medicaid-expansion CHIP programs will keep Medicaid coverage and
states will receive the enhanced CHIP match rate for these children
starting in 2014. CHIP enrollees with incomes between 100% and 150%
FPL will be transitioned to Medicaid and states will receive the CHIP
enhanced match rate for children above current levels and up to 150%
FPL. Require a report to Congress with recommendations to ensure that
coverage in the Health Insurance Exchange is comparable to coverage
under an average CHIP plan and that there are procedures to transfer
CHIP enrollees into the exchange without interrupting coverage or with a
written plan of treatment. (Report due by December 31, 2011)

• Expand Medicaid to all individuals under age 65 (children, pregnant
women, parents, and adults without dependent children) with incomes
up to 133% FPL based on modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) (to
be implemented in 2014). All newly eligible adults will be guaranteed
a benchmark benefit package that at least provides the essential
health benefits. Require states to provide premium assistance to any
Medicaid beneficiary with access to employer-sponsored insurance if
it is cost-effective for the state. To finance the coverage for the newly
eligible (those who were not previously eligible for a full benchmark
benefit package or who were eligible for a capped program but were not
enrolled), states will receive 100% federal funding for 2014 through 2016.
Beginning in 2017, financing for the newly eligible will be shared between
the states and the federal government through an increase in the federal
medical assistance percentage (FMAP). For states that already cover
adults with incomes above 100% FPL, the percentage point increase in
the FMAP will be 30.3 in 2017 and 31.3 in 2018. For all other states, the
percentage point increase in the FMAP will be 34.3 in 2017 and 33.3 in
2018. Beginning in 2019, all states will receive an FMAP increase of 32.3
percentage points for the newly eligible.
• Require states to maintain current income eligibility levels for children
in Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) until
2019. CHIP benefit package and cost-sharing rules will continue as
under current law. Beginning in 2014, states will receive a 23 percentage
point increase in the CHIP match rate up to a cap of 100%. CHIP-eligible
children who are unable to enroll in the program due to enrollment caps
will be eligible for tax credits in the state Exchanges.

 Premium and costsharing subsidies
to individuals

House Leadership Bill
Affordable Health Care for America Act (H.R. 3962)

Senate Leadership Bill
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (H.R. 3590)

• Provide affordability premium credits to eligible individuals and families
with incomes up to 400% FPL to purchase insurance through the Health
Insurance Exchange. The premium credits will be based on the average
cost of the three lowest cost basic health plans in the area and will be set
on a sliding scale such that the premium contributions are limited to the
following percentages of income for specified income tiers:
133-150% FPL: 1.5 - 3% of income
150-200% FPL: 3 - 5.5% of income
200-250% FPL: 5.5 - 8% of income
250-300% FPL: 8 - 10% of income
300-350% FPL: 10 - 11% of income
350-400% FPL: 11 - 12% of income
(Effective January 1, 2013)
• Index the affordability premium credits after 2013 to maintain the ratio of
government to enrollee shares of the premiums over time.
• Provide affordability cost-sharing credits to eligible individuals and
families with incomes up to 400% FPL. The cost-sharing credits reduce
the cost-sharing amounts and annual cost-sharing limits and have
the effect of increasing the actuarial value of the basic benefit plan to
the following percentages of the full value of the plan for the specified
income tier:
133-150% FPL: 97%
150-200% FPL: 93%
200-250% FPL: 85%
250-300% FPL: 78%
300-350% FPL: 72%
350-400% FPL: 70%
(Effective January 1, 2013)
• Lower the out-of-pocket spending limits established in the essential
benefits package ($5,000/individual and $10,000/family) for eligible
individuals and families with incomes up to 400% FPL to the following
amounts:
133-150% FPL: $500/individual; $1,000/family
150-200% FPL: $1,000/individual; $2,000/family
200-250% FPL: $2,000/individual; $4,000/family
250-300% FPL: $4,000/individual; $8,000/family
300-350% FPL: $4,500/individual; $9,000/family
350-400% FPL: $5,000/individual; $10,000/family
(Effective January 1, 2013)

• Provide refundable and advanceable premium credits to individuals and
families with incomes between 100-400% FPL to purchase insurance
through the Exchanges. The premium credits will be tied to the second
lowest-cost silver plan in the area and will be set on a sliding scale such
that the premium contributions are limited to 2.8% of income for those
at 100% FPL to 9.8% of income for those between 300-400% FPL, except
that for those with incomes between 100 and 133% FPL, the premium
contribution is limited to 2% of income. (These are the provisions as
drafted; however, individuals with incomes less than 133% FPL are
intended to get their coverage through Medicaid.)
• Increase the premium contributions for those receiving subsidies
annually by the rate of premium growth from the preceding year.
• Provide cost-sharing subsidies to eligible individuals and families with
incomes between 100-200% FPL. For those with incomes between 100150% FPL, the cost-sharing subsidies will result in coverage for 90% of
the benefit costs of the plan. For those with incomes between 150-200%,
the cost-sharing subsidies will result in coverage for 80% of the benefit
costs of the plan. American Indians with income less than 300% FPL will
not be subject to any cost-sharing requirements.
• Limit availability of premium credits and cost-sharing subsidies
through the Exchanges to U.S. citizens and legal immigrants who meet
income limits. Employees who are offered coverage by an employer
are not eligible for premium credits unless the employer plan does not
have an actuarial value of at least 60% or if the employee share of the
premium exceeds 9.8% of income. Legal immigrants who are barred
from enrolling in Medicaid during their first five years in the U.S. will be
eligible for premium credits.
• Require verification of both income and citizenship status in determining
eligibility for the federal premium credits.
• Ensure that federal premium or cost-sharing subsidies are not used to
purchase coverage for abortion if coverage extends beyond saving the life
of the woman or in cases of rape or incest. If an individual who receives
federal assistance purchases coverage in a plan that chooses to cover
abortion services beyond those for which federal funds are permitted,
those federal subsidy funds (for premiums or cost-sharing) must not be
used for the purchase of the abortion coverage and must be segregated
from private premium payments or state funds.
• Provisions related to the premium and cost-sharing subsidies are
effective January 1, 2014.

Premium and costsharing subsidies
to individuals (continued)

• Limit availability of premium and cost-sharing credits to US citizens and
lawfully residing immigrants who meet the income limits and are not
enrolled in qualified or grandfathered employer or individual coverage,
Medicare, Medicaid (except those eligible to enroll in the Exchange),
TRICARE, or VA coverage (with some exceptions). Individuals with access
to employer-based coverage are eligible for the premium and costsharing credits if the cost of the employee premium exceeds 12% of the
individuals’ income.
• Require verification of both income and citizenship status in determining
eligibility for the federal premium and cost-sharing credits.
• Prohibit federal premium subsidies from being used to purchase a health
plan in the Exchange that includes coverage for abortions except to save
the life of the woman or in cases of rape or incest. Individuals receiving
federal subsidies may purchase supplemental coverage for abortions but
that coverage must be paid for entirely with private funds.

Premium subsidies
to employers

• Provide small employers with fewer than 25 employees and average
wages of less than $40,000 with a health coverage tax credit for up to
two years. The full credit of 50% of premium costs paid by employers is
available to employers with 10 or fewer employees and average annual
wages of $20,000 or less. The credit phases-out as firm size and average
wage increases and is not permitted for employees earning more than
$80,000 per year. (Effective January 1, 2013)
• Create a temporary reinsurance program for employers providing
health insurance coverage to retirees over age 55 who are not eligible
for Medicare. Program will reimburse employers for 80% of retiree
claims between $15,000 and $90,000. Payments from the reinsurance
program will be used to lower the costs for enrollees in the employer
plan. Appropriate $10 billion over ten years for the reinsurance program.
(Effective 90 days after enactment)

• Provide small employers with no more than 25 employees and average
annual wages of less than $40,000 that purchase health insurance for
employees with a tax credit.
– Phase I: For tax years 2011 through 2013, provide a tax credit of up
to 35% of the employer’s contribution toward the employee’s health
insurance premium if the employer contributes at least 50% of the total
premium cost or 50% of a benchmark premium. The full credit will be
available to employers with 10 or fewer employees and average annual
wages of less than $20,000. The credit phases-out as firm size and
average wage increases. Tax-exempt small businesses meeting these
requirements are eligible for tax credits of up to 25% of the employer’s
contribution toward the employee’s health insurance premium.
– Phase II: For tax years 2014 and later, for eligible small businesses that
purchase coverage through the state Exchange, provide a tax credit of
up to 50% of the employer’s contribution toward the employee’s health
insurance premium if the employer contributes at least 50% of the total
premium cost. The credit will be available for two years. The full credit
will be available to employers with 10 or fewer employees and average
annual wages of less than $20,000. The credit phases-out as firm size and
average wage increases. Tax-exempt small businesses meeting these
requirements are eligible for tax credits of up to 35% of the employer’s
contribution toward the employee’s health insurance premium.
• Create a temporary reinsurance program for employers providing
health insurance coverage to retirees over age 55 who are not eligible
for Medicare. Program will reimburse employers or insurers for 80%
of retiree claims between $15,000 and $90,000. Payments from the
reinsurance program will be used to lower the costs for enrollees in the
employer plan. Appropriate $5 billion to finance the program. (Effective
90 days following enactment through January 1, 2014)

point). The threshold amounts will be increased for retired individuals
age 55 and older who are not eligible for Medicare and for employees
engaged in high-risk professions by $1,350 for individual coverage and
$3,000 for family coverage. In the 17 states with the highest health care
costs, the threshold amount is increased by 20% initially; this increase is
subsequently reduced by half each year until it is phased out in 2015. The
tax is equal to 40% of the value of the plan that exceeds the threshold
amounts and is imposed on the issuer of the health insurance policy,
which in the case of a self-insured plan is the plan administrator or, in
some cases, the employer. The aggregate value of the health insurance
plan includes reimbursements under a flexible spending account for
medical expenses (health FSA) or health reimbursement arrangement
(HRA), employer contributions to a health savings account (HSA), and
coverage for dental, vision, and other supplementary health insurance
coverage. (Effective January 1, 2013)

• Increase the Medicare Part A (hospital insurance) tax rate on wages by
0.5% (from 1.45% to 1.95%) on earnings over $200,000 for individual
taxpayers and $250,000 for married couples filing jointly; funds deposited
into the Medicare Part A Trust Fund. (Effective January 1, 2013)

• Create a Consumer Operated and Oriented Program (CO-OP) to
facilitate the establishment of non-profit, member-run health insurance
cooperatives to provide insurance through the Exchange. (Effective six
months following enactment)
• Create four benefit categories of plans to be offered through the
Exchange:
– Basic plan includes essential benefits package and covers 70% of the
benefit costs of the plan;
– Enhanced plan includes essential benefits package, reduced costsharing compared to the basic plan, and covers 85% of benefit costs of
the plan;
– Premium plan includes essential benefits package with reduced costsharing compared to the enhanced plan and covers 95% of the benefit
costs of the plan;
– Premium plus plan is a premium plan that provides additional benefits,
such as oral health and vision care.
• Require guarantee issue and renewability; allow rating variation based
only on age (limited to 2 to 1 ratio), premium rating area, and family
enrollment.
• Require plans participating in the Exchange to be state licensed, report
data as required, implement affordability credits, meet network adequacy
standards, provide culturally and linguistically appropriate services,
contract with essential community providers and Indian health care
providers, and participate in risk pooling. Require participating plans
to offer one basic plan for each service area and permit them to offer
additional plans. Require plans to provide information related to end-oflife planning to individuals and provide the option to establish advance
directives and physician’s order for life-sustaining treatment.
• Provide information to consumers and small employers to enable
them to choose among plans in the Exchange, including establishing a
telephone hotline and maintaining a website, and provide information on
open enrollment periods and how to enroll.
• Require private insurers that opt to provide a plan in the Exchange that
covers abortions beyond those permitted by federal law (to save the life
of the woman and in cases of rape and incest) to also offer an identical
plan that does not cover abortions for which federal funding is prohibited.
Private plans participating in the Exchange may offer supplemental
coverage for abortions. Federal premium subsidies may not be used
to purchase a plan or supplemental coverage that covers abortions
beyond those permitted by federal law. Prohibit plans participating in
the Exchange from discriminating against any provider because of an
unwillingness to provide abortions.

• Create the Consumer Operated and Oriented Plan (CO-OP) program
to foster the creation of non-profit, member-run health insurance
companies in all 50 states and District of Columbia to offer qualified
health plans. To be eligible to receive funds, an organization must not be
an existing health insurer or sponsored by a state or local government,
substantially all of its activities must consist of the issuance of qualified
health benefit plans in each state in which it is licensed, governance of
the organization must be subject to a majority vote of its members, must
operate with a strong consumer focus, and any profits must be used to
lower premiums, improve benefits, or improve the quality of health care
delivered to its members. (Appropriate $6 billion to finance the program
and award loans and grants to establish CO-OPs by July 1, 2013)
• Create four benefit categories of plans plus a separate catastrophic plan
to be offered through the Exchange, and in the individual and small group
markets:
– Bronze plan represents minimum creditable coverage and provides the
essential health benefits, cover 60% of the benefit costs of the plan,
with an out-of-pocket limit equal to the Health Savings Account (HSA)
current law limit ($5,950 for individuals and $11,900 for families in
2010);
– Silver plan provides the essential health benefits, covers 70% of the
benefit costs of the plan, with the HSA out-of-pocket limits;
– Gold plan provides the essential health benefits, covers 80% of the
benefit costs of the plan, with the HSA out-of-pocket limits;
– Platinum plan provides the essential health benefits, covers 90% of the
benefit costs of the plan, with the HSA out-of-pocket limits;
– Catastrophic plan available to those up to age 30 or to those who
are exempt from the mandate to purchase coverage and provides
catastrophic coverage only with the coverage level set at the HSA
current law levels except that prevention benefits and coverage for
three primary care visits would be exempt from the deductible. This
plan is only available in the individual market.
• Reduce the out-of-pocket limits for those with incomes up to 400% FPL
to the following levels:
– 100-200% FPL: one-third of the HSA limits ($1,983/individual and
$3,967/family);
– 200-300% FPL: one-half of the HSA limits ($2,975/individual and
$5,950/family);
– 300-400% FPL: two-thirds of the HSA limits ($3,987/individual and
$7,973/family).
  These out-of-pocket reductions are applied within the actuarial limits of
the plan and will not increase the actuarial value of the plan.

• Allow states to operate state-based exchanges if they demonstrate the
capacity to meet the requirements for administering the exchange.
• Unless otherwise noted, provisions relating to the Health Insurance
Exchange are effective January 1, 2013.

• Require guarantee issue and renewability and allow rating variation
based only on age (limited to 3 to 1 ratio), premium rating area, family
composition, and tobacco use (limited to 1.5. to 1 ratio) in the individual
and the small group market and the Exchange.
• Require qualified health plans participating in the Exchange to meet
marketing requirements, have adequate provider networks, contract
with essential community providers, contract with navigators to conduct
outreach and enrollment assistance, be accredited with respect to
performance on quality measures, use a uniform enrollment form and
standard format to present plan information.
• Require the Exchanges to maintain a call center for customer service,
and establish procedures for enrolling individuals and businesses and
for determining eligibility for tax credits. Require states to develop a
single form for applying for state health subsidy programs that can be
filed online, in person, by mail or by phone. Permit Exchanges to contract
with state Medicaid agencies to determine eligibility for tax credits in the
Exchanges.
• Permit states the option to create a Basic Health Plan for uninsured
individuals with incomes between 133-200% FPL who would otherwise
be eligible to receive premium subsidies in the Exchange. States opting
to provide this coverage will contract with one or more standard plans
to provide at least the essential health benefits and must ensure that
eligible individuals do not pay more in premiums than they would have
paid in the Exchange and that the cost-sharing requirements do not
exceed those of the platinum plan for enrollees with income less than
150% FPL or the gold plan for all other enrollees. States will receive 85%
of the funds that would have been paid as federal premium and costsharing subsidies for eligible individuals to establish the Basic Health
Plan. Individuals with incomes between 133-200% FPL in states creating
Basic Health Plans will not be eligible for subsidies in the Exchanges.
• Require that at least one plan in the Exchanges provide coverage for
abortions beyond those for which federal funds are permitted (to save
the life of the woman or in cases of rape or incest) and require that at
least one plan in the Exchange does not provide coverage for abortions
beyond those for which federal funds are permitted. Plans that choose
to offer coverage for abortions beyond those for which federal funds are
permitted must estimate the actuarial value of covering abortions by
taking into account the cost of the abortion benefit (valued at no less than
$1 per enrollee per month) and cannot take into account any savings that
might be reaped as a result of the abortions. Prohibit plans participating
in the Exchanges from discriminating against any provider because of a
willingness or unwillingness to provide, pay for, provide coverage of, or
refer for abortions.

Financing

The Congressional Budget Office estimates the net cost of the proposal
(less payments from employers and uninsured individuals) to be $894
billion over ten years. These costs are financed through a combination
of savings from Medicare and Medicaid and new taxes and fees. The net
savings from Medicare and Medicaid are estimated to be $426 billion over
ten years and the primary sources of these savings include incorporating
productivity improvements into Medicare market basket updates, reducing
payments to Medicare Advantage plans, changing the Medicaid drug
rebate provisions, and cutting Medicaid and Medicare DSH payments.
(See descriptions of cost savings provisions in Cost containment.) The
largest source of new revenue will come from a 5.4% surcharge imposed
on families with incomes above $1,000,000 and individuals with incomes
above $500,000, which is projected to raise $461 billion in revenue.
Additional revenue provisions will generate $97 billion over the same time
period. (See Tax changes related to health insurance.) CBO estimates the
proposal will reduce the deficit by $104 billion over ten years.

The Congressional Budget Office estimates the cost of the coverage
components of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to be $848
billion over ten years. These costs are financed through a combination
of savings from Medicare and Medicaid and new taxes and fees. The net
savings from Medicare and Medicaid are estimated to be $491 billion over
ten years and the primary sources of these savings include reductions in
updates in Medicare payment rates for hospitals, home health agencies
and other providers (other than physicians), reductions in payments to
Medicare Advantage plans, reductions attributable to recommendations
issued by a new Independent Medicare Advisory Board, and increases
in Medicare Parts B and D premiums for higher income Medicare
beneficiaries, changing the Medicaid drug rebate provisions, and cutting
Medicaid and Medicare DSH payments. (See descriptions of cost savings
provisions in Cost containment.) The largest source of new revenue will
come from an excise tax on high-cost insurance, which CBO estimates will
raise $149 billion over ten years. Additional revenue provisions include fees
on certain manufacturers and insurers, an increase in hospital insurance
contributions for high high-income taxpayers, and other provisions that
will generate $238 billion over the same time period. (See Tax changes
related to health insurance.) CBO estimates the proposal will reduce the
deficit by $130 billion over ten years.

Revenue Cvcle Services

1.1.1
-

"To hire, or obtain through an outside contractor ...a minimum of forty-six new revenue
cycle employeesfor assisting in the areas of registration,financial screening, billing, and
collections. "

1.1.1.I "the employees will be categorized as follows (number of minimum employees for each
category): registration clerks and eligibility screening (13), limit of liability screening
and patient counseling (13), cashiers (5), O/P follow-up and rejections (5), financial
clerks (2), collections (3), operations auditor (I), IT financial analyst (2), financial
analyst (2)";
1.1.2
-

"To continue this Program until the Program's direct costs equal at least four million
one hundred thousand dollars ($4,100,000.00)."

The additional services for revenue cycle activities are being provided through the services of
outside vendors, and through System personnel. To-date, we estimate the System has added: 77
Registration and Eligibility clerks; 4 limit of liability and patient financial counseling personnel,
33 outpatient follow-up and denials personnel, 4 financial clerks, 6 persons in collections, 3.5
operations auditors, 12.5 IT fmancial analysts, and 2 financial analysts. The total of the personnel
is estimated at 145.
The estimated direct costs incurred to-date for the above personnel are estimated to be at least
$13,681,371.

We note that registration and eligibility personnel also function as financial counselors, and
would ask that these two categories be consolidated for these reporting purposes. Also, the
System presently has budgeted 15 cashiers at .an estimated budgeted annualized cost of $565,000.
We have determined this number is more than sufficient for present activity levels, and ask that
the agreed upon additions to this category be replaced by personnel we have retained in one of the
other categories. Also, be advised that by terms of a contract with a vendor approved recently by
the Board of the Cook County Health & Hospitals System, 34 additional revenue cycle personnel
in the categories identified in the settlement agreement will be brought on board over the next
four months at an estimated additional annualized cost of $2,233,861
