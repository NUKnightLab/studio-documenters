maintaining sustainable, dignified jobs; generating wealth; improving the quality of life of workers; and
promoting community and local economic development, particularly for people who lack access to
conventional means of business ownership; and
WHEREAS, many worker cooperatives in the United States today were designed to improve low- wage
jobs and build wealth in communities most directly affected by inequality; and

business growth, attraction, and retention; supporting workforce development, job creation, and sustainable

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners celebrates the
tremendous benefits of worker cooperatives in Cook County and supports the movement to create more
worker cooperatives throughout the region; and

help to equip other organizations to provide such services, focusing on services to lowincome residents or
‐

in underserved areas; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, the Bureau of Economic Development is encouraged to help worker
cooperatives access tailored resources created by community organizations and make referrals to

education initiatives; and
