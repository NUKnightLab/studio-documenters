The contract-specific goal set on this contract was zero. The Chief Procurement Officer concurs.
Summary: This increase and first of two (2), one (1) year renewal options will allow the Cook
County Assessor’s Office to continue to satisfy the statutory requirements set forth in 35
ILCS 200/12-20 and 715 ILCS 10/1 which require assessments to be published at the same time
for the North and South suburban townships. Cook County Suburban Publishers, Inc. can publish
the North and South suburban townships under one umbrella.
This contract will also allow the Cook County Clerk’s Office to continue to satisfy the statutory
requirements set forth in Article 12 of the Election Code, 10 ILCS 5/12-1 et seq. which requires
the Cook County Clerk’s Office to place notices in a minimum of two newspapers for each
suburban municipality in the election jurisdiction on the same day and for the same duration of
time. If multiple vendors are involved, there could be a scenario where some newspapers in
certain municipalities have different publication dates. This would result in a loss of coordination
of the notices and possible confusion among the voters. Therefore, it is necessary to have one source
that can publish notices in all election municipalities on the same day. Cook County Suburban
Publishers, Inc. can provide the necessary geographical coverage and guarantee that notices are placed
in the correct papers on the same day.
This contract was awarded as a Sole Source procurement pursuant to Section 34-139 of the Cook

Summary: The Bureau of Technology requests approval of two amendments to Contract no. 1390-12899
with Oracle America, Inc. to 1) exercise the County’s Universal License Agreement (“ULA”) expansion
option, and 2) add Oracle’s Talent Software and Hosting Services to the product pool of the County’s
agreement.
The ULA is a component of the overarching Contract that allows the County to establish its license
consumption levels before entering maintenance mode. Because the County is currently implementing
multiple large Oracle-based projects with varying go-live dates through 2020, such as Enterprise Resource
Planning, Integrated Property, and the Enterprise Service Bus, it is important that the County exercises its
ULA expansion option in order to accommodate the license consumption required by these projects in the
coming years.
The Oracle Talent Software and Hosting Services element represent the products purchased by Oracle from
Taleo Corporation, which the County previously purchased from Taleo Corporation under Contract No.
09-41-351 in 2009 to provide automated recruiting, hiring, and onboarding for the County, Health and
Hospital System, Separately Elected Officials and Forest Preserve District.
The contract was awarded through the Request for Proposals (RFP) process in accordance with the Cook
County Procurement Code. Oracle America, Inc. was awarded this contract based on established evaluation
criteria.

commencement of such new construction or substantial rehabilitation to qualify
for a Class 6b incentive. With respect to abandoned property, the Class 6b
application must be made to the Assessor prior to the commencement of the
reoccupation of the vacant and unused property.
d.

In the instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property
as defined herein, the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may
still determine that special circumstances justify finding that the property is
deemed "abandoned" for purpose of Class 6b, unless:
1.

There has been a purchase for value and the buildings and other structures
have not been vacant and unused prior to such purchase; or

2.

There has been no purchase for value and the buildings and other
structures have been vacant and unused for less than 24 continuous
months.

The finding of abandonment, along with the specification of the special
circumstances, shall be included in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and
consenting to the Class 6b application. If the Ordinance or Resolution is that of a
municipality, the approval of the County Board is required to validate such a
finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b, and a
County Resolution to that effect shall be obtained. The applicant must obtain the
municipal enabling Ordinance with the required finding of special circumstances
and present such municipal Ordinance to the Board of Commissioners of Cook
County prior to its determination as to whether it will validate such a finding that
the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b and provide a County

Office for filing. A certified copy of the legislative action designating the
authorized officer and the authorized officer letter shall be included with the Class
6b application at the time of filing the application with the Assessor. The applicant
must demonstrate that the industrial development project qualifies for the Class 6b
classification.
Temporary Emergency Economic Recovery Modification (TEERM) Program: In
the instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property
as defined herein, the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may
still determine that special circumstances justify finding that the property is
deemed "abandoned" for purpose of a Class 6b under the TEERM Program if there:
1.

There has been no purchase for value; and

2.

The buildings and other structures have been vacant and unused for at least
12 continuous months.

The finding of abandonment, along with the specification of the special
circumstances, and a determination that the applicant's participation in the TEERM
Program is necessary for the development to occur, and that without such
designation the industrial enterprise would not be economically viable causing the
property to be in imminent risk of remaining vacant and unused, shall be included
in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and consenting to the Class 6b
application under the TEERM Program.
In addition, the Ordinance or Resolution where applicable shall:

If the Ordinance or Resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the County
Board is required to validate such a finding that the property is deemed
"abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b, and a County Resolution to that effect shall
be obtained. The applicant must obtain the municipal enabling Ordinance with the
required finding of special circumstances and present such municipal Ordinance
to the Board of Commissioners of Cook County prior to its determination as to
whether it will validate such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for
purposes of Class 6b and provide a County Resolution to that effect. A certified
copy of an Ordinance or Resolution finding that special circumstances exist, as
well as a certified copy of a County Ordinance or Resolution validating such a
finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b need not
be filed at the time of filing the Class 6b application with the Assessor, but must
be filed with the Assessor no later than the date an assessment appeal is filed to
request the class change to Class 6b. If the Resolution is not filed at the time of the
Class 6b application, the applicant shall instead file, at that time, a letter from the
municipality or the County as the case may be, confirming that a Resolution or
Ordinance regarding special circumstances has been requested.
Sustainable Emergency Relief (SER) Program: In the instance where real estate
does not meet the definition of abandoned property as defined herein, the
municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may still determine that
special circumstances justify finding that the property is deemed "qualified" for
purpose of Class 6b under the SER Program if:
1.

The industrial enterprise that occupies the premises has been at the same
location for a minimum of ten years prior to the date of application for the
SER Program; and

2.

The industrial enterprise that occupies the premises submits evidence of
hardship supporting a determination that participation in the SER Program
is necessary for the industrial enterprise to continue operations at its
current location and maintain its staff, and that without such designation
the industrial enterprise would not be economically viable causing the
property to be in imminent risk of becoming vacant and unused.

The finding that a property is qualified, along with the specification of the special
circumstances, and a determination that the applicant's participation in the SER
Program is necessary for the industrial enterprise to continue operations at its
current location and maintain its staff, and that without such designation the
industrial enterprise would not be economically viable causing the property to be
in imminent risk of becoming vacant and unused, shall be included in the
Resolution or Ordinance supporting and consenting to the Class 6b application
under the SER Program.

Board is required to validate such a finding that the property is deemed "qualified"
for purposes of Class 6b, and a County Resolution to that effect shall be obtained.
The applicant must obtain the municipal enabling Ordinance with the required
finding of special circumstances and present such municipal Ordinance to the
Board of Commissioners of Cook County prior to its determination as to whether
it will validate such a finding that the property is deemed "qualified" for purposes
of Class 6b and provide a County Resolution to that effect. A certified copy of an
Ordinance or Resolution finding that special circumstances exist, as well as a
certified copy of a County Ordinance or Resolution validating such a finding that
the property is deemed "qualified" for purposes of Class 6b need not be filed at the
time of filing the Class 6b application with the Assessor, but must be filed with the
Assessor no later than the date an assessment appeal is filed to request the class
change to Class 6b. If the Resolution is not filed at the time of the Class 6b
application, the applicant shall instead file, at that time, a letter from the
municipality or the County as the case may be, confirming that a Resolution or
Ordinance regarding special circumstances has been requested.
Applications for Class 6b incentives pursuant to the TEERM Program or SER
Program under a Class 6b application must be received by the Assessor's Office
on or before November 30, 2018 to receive consideration.
The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of annual reports by recipients of
Class 6b incentives granted pursuant to the SER Program as to the use of the
property and the number of persons employed at the Class 6b site. In such reports,
recipients shall be required to certify whether the industrial enterprise that
occupied the premises at the time of the SER application continues its operations
at that location. In addition, recipients of Class 6b incentives granted pursuant to
the SER Program shall be required to report to the Assessor within 30 days if the
industrial enterprise that occupied the premises at the time of the SER application
ceases operations at that location. A copy of such reports will be forwarded by the
Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the County Board for distribution to members
of the County Board from the affected districts. Failure to file such reports within
the time established by the Assessor's rules shall result in loss of the incentive for
the period relating to the non-filing. Additionally, if the industrial enterprise that
occupied the premises at the time of the SER application ceases operations at that
location, then the Class 6b incentive granted pursuant to the SER program shall
terminate.
e.

This classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the date such new
construction (excluding demolition, if any) or such substantial rehabilitation was
completed and initially assessed, or in the case of abandoned property, from the
date of substantial re-occupancy, or in the case of incentives granted pursuant to

88

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

the TEERM Program, from the date of the notice of approval. In the case of
incentives granted pursuant to the SER Program, this classification shall continue
for a period of 12 years from the date of the notice of approval, or until the
industrial enterprise that occupied the premises at the time of the SER application
ceases operations at that location if that occurs sooner.
f.

Unless a Class 6b granted pursuant to the TEERM Program or the SER Program,
this incentive may be renewed during the last year a property is entitled to a ten
percent assessment level pursuant to Section 74-64(7), if the following
requirements are met:
1.

The taxpayer notifies the Assessor's Office of intent to request renewal of
the incentive from the municipality or the County Board if the real estate
is located in an unincorporated area;

2.

The municipality in which the real estate is located or the County Board,
if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, adopts a Resolution
expressly stating that the municipality or the County Board, as the case
may be, has determined that the industrial use of the property is necessary
and beneficial to the local economy, and supports and consents to renewal
of the Class 6b; and

3.

A copy of the Resolution and a completed renewal application are filed
with the Assessor's Office before the expiration of the ten percent
assessment level period.

g.

Class 6b incentives that are granted pursuant to the TEERM Program or SER
Program are not renewable. For all other Class 6b incentives, the number of
renewal periods is not limited as long as the property continues to apply and meet
the requirements for Class 6b.

h.

A copy of the request for renewal of the incentive will be forwarded by the
Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the County Board for distribution to members
of the County Board from the affected districts.

i.

If no renewal is obtained, the incentive shall be phased out over the next two years,
pursuant to Section 74-64(7). After expiration of the last incentive period, the real
estate shall revert to the applicable classification under this Division.

j.

The Assessor may adopt rules consistent with this subsection necessary to ensure
proper review of all factors relevant to determine eligibility for the benefits
provided under Class 6b.

k.

The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports
by all Class 6b recipients as to the use of the property and the number of persons
employed at the Class 6b site. A copy of such reports will be forwarded by the
Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the County Board for distribution to members
of the County Board from the affected districts. Failure to file such reports within

Class C. Real estate which is to be used for industrial or commercial purposes, including
abandoned property, as defined in Section 74-62, including the land upon which such
property is situated; or vacant land; where such real estate because of contamination has
undergone environmental testing and remediation and has received a "No Further
Remediation Letter" from the site remediation program.
a.

To be eligible for a Class C classification an applicant must have received a "No
Further Remediation Letter" confirming achievement of the remediation
objectives based on the industrial or commercial use.

b.

The owner of the property is rendered ineligible for the Class C classification by
having previously owned or operated the site, directly or indirectly, or having been
a partner or being associated through a family or business relationship with anyone
who has owned or operated the site, which ownership or operation caused the
contamination which was remediated pursuant to a site remediation, except for an
employee who worked for an owner, as defined herein, that operated the site. A
present owner or employer who can successfully demonstrate that the owner or
employer was not responsible for the contamination may be eligible for Class C
classification.

c.

An applicant must obtain from the municipality in which the real estate is located
or the County Board if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, an
Ordinance or Resolution expressly stating that the municipality or County Board,
as the case may be, has determined that the incentive provided by Class C is
necessary for development to occur on that specific real estate and that the
municipality or County Board, as the case may be, supports and consents to the
Class C application to the Assessor. A certified copy of the Ordinance or
Resolution must be filed at the time of application for the Class C classification. A
copy of that Ordinance or Resolution, whichever is submitted, will be forwarded
by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the Board for distribution to the
members of the County Board from the affected districts.
In addition, the Ordinance or Resolution shall:

d.

1.

Describe the redevelopment objective of the municipality;

2.

State the applicant’s intended use of the property; and

3.

State that an Economic Disclosure Statement, as defined in this Division,
was received and filed by the municipality or County Board, as the case
may be.

To qualify for the Class C classification, an application for Class C classification
must be made within one year of the receipt of the "No Further Remediation
Letter". Where an application for Class C classification encompasses less than all
of the contiguous property owned by the applicant upon which remediation has
been completed, the one-year limitation will be waived for any subsequent separate
application for Class C classification for the remainder or for additional portions
of the property, provided that such subsequent application is made within seven

90

years.
e.

Additionally, to qualify for the Class C classification, the estimated remediation
costs, including site investigation, testing, oversight, remediation and removal
costs, monitoring, and engineering and legal fees associated with the remediation
process, must total at least $100,000.00, or alternatively, must total at least 25
percent of the market value of the real estate as determined by the Assessor's
property record card in the year prior to the remediation, whichever is less.

f.

The initial Class C classification shall continue for a period of 12 years for both
industrial and commercial property. For industrial property, this incentive may be
renewed during the last year a property is entitled to a 16-percent assessment level,
if the following requirements are met:
1.

The taxpayer notifies the Assessor's Office of the taxpayer's intent to
request renewal of the incentive from the municipality, or the County
Board if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area;

2.

The municipality in which the real estate is located or the County Board,
if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, adopts a Resolution
expressly stating that the municipality or County Board, as the case may
be, has determined that the industrial use of the property is necessary and
beneficial to the local economy, and supports and consents to renewal of
the Class C; and

3.

A copy of that Resolution and a completed renewal application are filed
with the Office of the Assessor before the expiration of the 16-percent
assessment level period.

The number of renewal periods is not limited as long as the property continues to
apply and qualify for Class C. Any property which applies for Class C treatment
on or before the adoption date of the ordinance from which this division is derived
will be eligible for this renewal term at the end of their original incentive period
subject to the above requirements. The notice of intent to request renewal which is
filed with the Assessor's Office will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the
Secretary of the Board for distribution to members of the County Board from the
effected districts.
g.

If, on November 23, 1999, a property is receiving Class C treatment, but the
assessment level is higher than 16 percent, that taxpayer may apply for renewal as
outlined above and receive a 16-percent assessment level for the prescribed period
beginning after the filing and approval of the resolution and renewal application.
However, if, as of that effective date, the taxpayer's assessment is higher than 16
percent and the taxpayer is granted a renewal of the incentive for subsequent years,
no reduction of the current assessment level based on renewal of the incentive will
be granted. If no renewal is obtained, the incentive shall be phased out over the
next two years, pursuant to Section 74-64. After such ten-year period expiration of
the last incentive period, the real estate shall revert to the applicable classification
under this Division.

h.

For commercial properties, once the original 12-year incentive period has expired,
the commercial Class C incentive will expire. The incentive classification will not
be subject to renewal and the real estate shall revert to the applicable classification
under this Division.

i.

The Assessor shall review the application and supporting documentation to
determine eligibility for the Class C classification. The Assessor may adopt rules
consistent with the foregoing necessary to ensure proper review of all factors
relevant to determine initial and continued eligibility for the benefits provided
under the Class C classification.

j.

The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports
by all Class C recipients as to the use of the property and the number of persons
employed at the Class C site. Such reports shall be verified. Failure to file such
reports within the time established by the Assessor's rules shall result in loss of the
incentive for the period relating to the non-filing.

Class 7a. Real estate used primarily for commercial purposes, comprising a qualified
commercial development project, as determined pursuant to Section 74-65(a), located in
an area in need of commercial development, where total development costs, exclusive of
land, do not exceed $2,000,000.00, consisting of all newly constructed buildings or other
structures, including the land upon which they are situated; or abandoned property, as
defined in this Division, including the land upon which such property is situated; or all
buildings and other structures which are substantially rehabilitated to the extent such
rehabilitation has added to their value, including qualified land related to the rehabilitation.
Land qualifies when the rehabilitation adds vertical or horizontal square footage to the
improvements. The amount of land eligible for the incentive shall be in such proportion as
the square footage added by the rehabilitation bears to the total square footage of the
improvements on the parcel.
a.

In the instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property

a.

b.

Land qualifies when the rehabilitation adds vertical or horizontal square
footage to the improvements. The amount of land eligible for the incentive
shall be in such proportion as the square footage added by the rehabilitation
bears to the total square footage of the improvements on the parcel. Such real
estate must be either obtained through the Cook County Tax Reactivation
Project or must be located in one of the following designated geographical
areas:
1.

An area which has been certified as in need of substantial
revitalization in accordance with the provisions of Section 74-65(b);

Any one of the following five townships: Bloom, Bremen, Calumet,
Rich and Thornton.

In the instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned
property as defined herein, the municipality or the County Board, as the case
may be, may still determine that special circumstances justify that the property
is deemed "abandoned" for purpose of Class 8, unless:
1.

There has been a purchase for value and the buildings and other
structures have not been vacant and unused prior to such purchase; or

2.

There has been no purchase for value and the buildings and other

Resolution, an applicant may obtain from an authorized officer of the municipality
or an authorized officer of the Cook County Bureau of Economic Development if
the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, a letter stating that the

This classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the date of new
construction (excluding demolition, if any) or substantial rehabilitation was
completed and initially assessed, or in the case of abandoned property, from
the date of substantial re-occupancy, or in the case of incentives granted
pursuant to the TEERM Program, from the date of the notice of approval.

f.

Unless it was granted pursuant to the TEERM Program, this incentive may be
renewed during the last year a property is entitled to a ten-percent assessment
level pursuant to Section 74-64(11), if the following requirements are met:
1.

The taxpayer notifies the Assessor's Office of the taxpayer's intent to
request renewal of the incentive from the municipality, or the County
Board if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area;

active apprenticeship and training program approved and registered
with the United States Department of Labor's Office of
Apprenticeship, if the contractor or subcontractor employs people in
a covered occupation.

g.

Class 8 incentives that are granted pursuant to the TEERM Program are not

occur, the date that the major rehabilitation was completed and that the real estate
complies with all applicable local building, safety and health requirements and
codes. Upon completion of the new construction, the applicant must supplement
the application by submitting an occupancy permit showing the date that the new
construction was completed and ready for occupancy, and evidence that the real
estate complies with all applicable local building, safety and health requirements
and codes.

d.

Beginning January 1, 2000, the Class 9 classification shall have an initial duration
of ten years from the date that the major rehabilitation was completed. That period
may be extended for additional ten-year periods if:
1.

An application is filed with the Assessor at least 12 months before the
expiration of the incentive period;

2.

The applicant presents evidence that the real estate currently complies with
all applicable local building, safety and health requirements and codes;
and

3.

The Assessor determines that all application qualifications, except the
major rehabilitation or new construction requirement, were maintained
during the incentive period.

When the Class 9 classification is due to expire or is terminated by action of the
owner or the Assessor, the property owner shall, in a manner and form determined
by the Assessor, notify all Class 9 tenants of the date of the termination of Class 9
classification. Once the Class 9 classification is terminated, the real estate shall
revert to the applicable classification under this Division.

Class S. Real estate otherwise entitled to Class 3 classification under this division,
consisting of land and existing buildings and structures, which is has been subject to a
Section 8 contract renewal. The portion of the land and building eligible for the incentive
shall be in such proportion as the number of Section 8 units bears to the total number of
units. The proportion shall be applied only to property used for residential purposes, and
not to portions of the property, if any, used for commercial purposes.
a.

Property qualifies for the Class S classification if its Section 8 contract has been
renewed pursuant to one of the following alternatives:
1.

2.

HUD has approved renewal of the Section 8 contract under the mark up to
market option, after finding that:
i.

The property has received a physical inspection score of at least
60, in an inspection by HUD's Real Estate Assessment Center,
confirming that the property is decent, safe, sanitary and in good
repair with no uncorrected exigent health and safety (EHS)
violations;

ii.

The property does not have a low- and moderate-income use
restriction that cannot be eliminated by unilateral action by the
owner. If, however, the current rent is lower than the use
restriction, HUD may use the mark up to market option to increase
the rents to the use restriction level, which would be a renewal
qualifying for the S classification; and

iii.

A rent comparability study conducted by HUD has demonstrated
that comparable market rents are above 100 percent of the HUD
Fair Market Rent.

HUD has approved a contract renewal for five years of the Section 8
contract under the mark up to market under HUD's discretionary authority,
after finding that the property meets at least one of the required criteria:
i.

A vulnerable population is affected,

ii.

There is a low vacancy rate in the area, which would make tenant
based assistance difficult to use, or a lack of comparable housing,
or

iii.

The project is a high priority for the local community, as
demonstrated by a contribution of state or local funds to the
property.

with a mark up to market option may apply for Class S classification for the any
portion of the 2001 assessment year encompassed within the contract term, and for
the remainder of the contract term, including any renewals approved with the mark
up to market option. The classification shall continue until the expiration or
termination of the Section 8 contract.

The incentive may be renewed if the Section 8 contract is again renewed under any
of the following three options: 1) the mark up to market option; 2) the mark up to
market option under HUD's discretionary authority; or 3) by a not-for-profit
corporation under any available option under HUD's renewal procedures as
described in HUD's Section 8 Renewal Policy Guidelines. Upon filing an
application with HUD, no less than 120 days prior to termination of the contract,
for renewal of the Section 8 contract, the taxpayer shall provide notice to the
Assessor's Office of its application for renewal. The taxpayer shall provide a copy
to the Assessor's Office of HUD's approval of the contract renewal, or notification
of other action.

f.

The Assessor's Office shall adopt rules consistent with this subsection necessary
to ensure proper review of all factors relevant to determine initial and continued
eligibility for the benefits provided under Class S.

Class L. Real estate which is to be used for commercial or industrial purposes and which
is designated as Class 3, Class 4, Class 5a or Class 5b pursuant to this Division; is a
landmark or contributing building; and has undergone substantial rehabilitation. The
substantial rehabilitation must constitute an investment by the owner of at least 50 percent
of the building's full market value as determined by the Assessor in the assessment year
prior to the commencement of the substantial rehabilitation.
a.

Generally, the incentive shall apply only to the building and will not apply to the
land underneath the building. However, if the entire building has been vacant and
unused for at least 24 continuous months prior to the filing of the eligibility
application with the Assessor, the land upon which the building is situated shall
also be eligible for the incentive.

b.

Prior to filing a Class L eligibility application with the Assessor, an applicant must
obtain an Ordinance or Resolution from the unit of local government in which the
real estate is located, which expressly states that the local government:
1.

Has determined that the incentive provided by Class L is necessary for the
substantial rehabilitation of the property;

2.

Supports and consents to the granting of the incentive; and

3.

Has reviewed and accepted its preservation commission's written
recommendation of the project for the Class L incentive. This
recommendation will specify the project's budget and proposed scope of
work and will specify that the project will meets or exceeds the Standards
of the United States Department of the Interior for Rehabilitation,
Preservation, Restoration, and Reconstruction of historic properties.

4.

In addition, the Ordinance or Resolution shall:
i.

Describe the redevelopment objective of the municipality;

ii.

State the applicant’s intended use of the property; and

iii.

March 22, 2017

State that an Economic Disclosure Statement, as defined in this
Division, was received and filed by the municipality or County
Board, as the case may be.

c.

A certified copy of the Ordinance or Resolution need not be filed with the Assessor
at the time the Class L eligibility application is filed but the Ordinance or
Resolution must be filed with the Assessor no later than the date an assessment
appeal is filed to request the class change to Class L.

d.

If the Ordinance or Resolution is not filed at the time of the eligibility application
is filed, the applicant shall instead, include the following items with the eligibility
application:
1.

A letter from the municipality or the County, as the case may be,
confirming that a Resolution or Ordinance supporting the incentive has
been requested; and

2.

A copy of the preservation commission's recommendation of the project.

e.

A copy of the Resolution or letter confirming that a Resolution has been requested,
whichever is filed with the application, will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office
to the Secretary of the Board for distribution to the members of the County Board
from the affected districts.

f.

Additionally, to qualify a landmark building or contributing building for Class L
classification, an eligibility application must be made to the Assessor within one
year prior to the commencement of substantial rehabilitation. After the substantial
rehabilitation has been completed, the preservation commission shall review the
project to determine that it is eligible under Subsection (14) of this Section. The
applicant must supplement the eligibility application with a copy of the
determination of the preservation commission prior to classification of the real
estate as Class L.

g.

The initial Class L classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the
date such substantial rehabilitation was completed and initially assessed.

h.

For property which was initially classified as Class 3, 4 or 5b, this incentive may
be renewed during the last year a property is entitled to a 16-percent assessment
level, if the following requirements are met:
1.

The taxpayer notifies the Assessor's Office of the taxpayer's intent to
request renewal of the incentive from the municipality, or the County
Board if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area;

2.

The municipality in which the real estate is located or the County Board,
if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, adopts a resolution
expressly stating that the municipality or County Board, as the case may
be, has determined that the industrial use of the property is necessary and
beneficial to the local economy, and supports and consents to renewal of
the Class L; and

3.

March 22, 2017

A copy of that Resolution and a completed renewal application are filed
with the Office of the Assessor before the expiration of the incentive
period.

The number of renewal periods is not limited as long as the property continues to
apply and qualify for Class L. The notice of intent to request renewal which is filed
with the Assessor's Office will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the
Secretary of the County Board for distribution to members of the County Board
from the affected districts.
i.

If, as of November 23, 1999, a property is receiving Class L treatment, but the
assessment level is higher than 16 percent, that taxpayer may apply for renewal as
outlined above and receive a 16-percent assessment level for the prescribed period
beginning after the filing and approval of the Resolution and renewal application.
However, if as of the effective date, the taxpayer's assessment is higher than 16
percent and the taxpayer is granted a renewal of the incentive for subsequent years,
no reduction of the current assessment level based on renewal of the incentive will
be granted. If no renewal is obtained, the incentive shall be phased out over the
next two years, pursuant to Section 74-64. After expiration of the last incentive
period, the real estate shall revert to the applicable classification under this
Division.

j.

For commercial properties, once the original 12-year incentive period has expired,
the commercial Class L incentive will expire. The incentive classification will not
be subject to renewal subject to subsection (h) and the real estate shall revert to the
applicable classification under this Division.

k.

The Assessor shall adopt rules consistent with the foregoing necessary to ensure
proper review of all factors relevant to determine initial and continued eligibility
for the benefits provided under Class L.

l.

The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports
by all Class L recipients as to the continued landmark status of the property and
the number of persons employed at the Class L site. Failure to file such reports
within the time established by the Assessor's rules may result in loss of the
incentive for the period relating to the non-filing.

m.

The Assessor shall provide the Chairman of the Business and Economic
Development Committee of the Cook County Board, annually on or before
December 1, a report of each Class L that was designated in the prior year. Such
report shall consist of the address of the Class L designated property, the date such
designation was granted, the amount of property taxes that were not assessed each
year during which the Class L incentive was in effect for such property, and if
provided by the applicant, the aggregate amount of the investment in the project
and the number of jobs generated in connection with such project.

Sec. 74-65. - Qualifications for commercial development project status.
(a)
To qualify as a commercial development project under Class 7a or 7b, it is necessary that
the project be located in an area in need of commercial development in that:

111

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

March 22, 2017

(1)

The area is or has been within the last ten years, currently, designated by Federal, State or
local agency as a conservation, blighted or renewal area or an area encompassing a
rehabilitation or redevelopment plan or project adopted under the Illinois Urban Renewal
Consolidation Act of 1961, as amended, or the Commercial Renewal Re-development
Areas Act of 1967, as amended, or that the area is located in a Federal Empowerment Zone
or Enterprise Community, as proposed and approved by the County Board on June 22,
1994, or the Chicago City Council on May 18, 1994, or the Commercial District
Development Commission Ordinance of the City of Chicago or designation of like effect
adopted under any similar statute or Ordinance;

(2)

Real estate taxes within the area, during the last six years, have declined, remained stagnant
or potential real estate taxes are not being fully realized due to the depressed condition of
the area, and/or subject site, or property values as determined by the assessed value (AV)
or equalized assessed value (EAV) for the redevelopment area or specific subject site have
declined over the last six (6) years, or property values as determined by the AV or EAV
are increasing at a rate that is less than the balance of the municipality’s AV or EAV for
the last six (6) years; or property values as determined by the AV or EAV for the
redevelopment area/site are increasing at a rate that is less than Consumer Price Index (CPI)
for All Urban Consumers as published by the US Department of Labor for last six (6) years;

(3)

There is a reasonable expectation that the development, re-development or rehabilitation
of the commercial development project is viable and likely to go forward on a reasonably
timely basis if granted Class 7a or 7b designation and will therefore result in the economic
enhancement of the area;

(4)

Certification of the commercial development project for Class 7a or 7b designation will
materially assist development, redevelopment or rehabilitation of the area and the
commercial development project would not go forward without the full incentive offered
under Class 7a or 7b; and

(5)

Certification of the commercial development project for Class 7a or 7b designation is
reasonably expected to ultimately result in an increase in real property tax revenue and
employment opportunities within the area.

(b)
Prior to filing a Class 7a or 7b eligibility application with the Assessor, an applicant must
obtain from the municipality in which the real estate is located, or the County Board if the real estate is
located in an unincorporated area, an Ordinance or a Resolution expressly stating that the municipality or
County Board, as the case may be, has determined that the conditions of Subsections (a)(1)-(a)(5) of this
Section are present and that the municipality or County Board, as the case may be, supports and consents
to the Class 7a or 7b application to the Assessor.
In addition, the Ordinance or Resolution shall:
1.

Describe the redevelopment objective of the municipality;

2.

State the applicant’s intended use of the property; and

3.

State that an Economic Disclosure Statement, as defined in this Division, was
received and filed by the municipality or County Board, as the case may be.

If a municipality enacts enabling legislation which identifies specific retail corridors or geographies
within the boundaries of such municipality that it deems to be distressed and in need of development and
which authorizes the submission of applications for Class 7a and 7b incentives for properties within such
retail corridors, applicants for Class 7a and Class 7b incentives located in such retail corridors may obtain
and submit to the Assessor, in lieu of an Ordinance or Resolution, a letter from an authorized officer of
such municipality approving the submission of the Class 7a or 7b incentive application and a certified copy
of the municipal enabling legislation.
A copy of the authorized officer letter and a certified copy of the municipal enabling legislation
shall be included with the Class 7a or Class 7b application and submitted to the Cook County Bureau of
Economic Development for verification prior to filing of the application with the Assessor.
In addition, the letter from the authorized officer shall:
1.

Describe the redevelopment objective of the municipality;

2.

State the applicant’s intended use of the property; and

3.

State that an Economic Disclosure Statement, as defined in this Division, was
received and filed by the municipality or County Board, as the case may be.

Following verification that the Class 7a or Class 7b application is in a retail corridor, as defined
herein, and has been properly submitted with a letter from an authorized officer and a certified copy of the
municipal enabling legislation, the Bureau of Economic Development will forward the application to the
Assessor’s Office for filing.
A certified copy of such Ordinance or Resolution or authorization letter and certified copy of the
municipal enabling legislation (if applicable) shall be included with the Class 7a or 7b application at the
time of filing the application with the Assessor. A copy of the Ordinance or Resolution, whichever is
submitted, will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the Board for distribution to the
members of the County Board from the affected districts. The application shall include any other
information deemed necessary by the Assessor. The applicant must demonstrate that the commercial
development project qualifies for the Class 7a or 7b classification and shall bear the expense of doing so.
(c)
Inasmuch as the County desires to encourage economic development in the neighborhoods
of the County, support the increased use of the incentive by smaller projects and to limit the expense of
such applications, the Assessor shall liberally construe the requirements of Subsections (a)(1)-(a)(5) of this
Section for Class 7a applications.
(d)
The Assessor shall adopt rules, including a provision to ensure a proper review of the
application and supporting data.
(e)
Certification of a commercial development project shall not be denied by reason of
insufficient size if it otherwise qualifies hereunder. In determining what constitutes the "full incentive
offered" as provided in Subsection (a)(4) of this Section, consideration may be given to any lawful
intergovernmental participation agreements under which the project developer has agreed, as a precondition
to Class 7a or 7b certification, to share a portion of future profits with the appropriate taxing districts.

In order to determine Class 7b applications, upon receipt of the application and all the
necessary supporting data, the Assessor shall forward it to the Economic Development Advisory Committee
of the County. The Committee shall within 30 days return the application to the Assessor with a finding
stating whether the conditions of Subsections (a)(1)-(a)(5) of this Section are present. The Assessor shall
review the application, supporting data, findings of the Committee and other appropriate facts. Where the
Assessor finds the conditions of Subsections (a)(1)-(a)(5) of this Section exist, the Assessor shall, within
30 days of the receipt of the Committee's findings, certify the commercial development project eligible for
Class 7b treatment under this Division.
(h)
Class 7a and 7b certifications shall lapse within one year from the date of issuance unless
new construction or substantial rehabilitation, or in the case of abandoned property, reoccupation of the
commercial development project has commenced prior to its expiration.
(i)
To be certified as an area in need of substantial revitalization for purposes of Class 8
classification it is necessary that:
(1)

The municipality in which the area is located or, if an unincorporated area, the
County determine by lawful Resolution that the area is in a state of economic
depression and that it is not economically feasible for private enterprise to
accomplish the necessary modernization, rehabilitation, and development of the
area without public assistance and encouragement, or a determination of similar
import;

(2)

The municipality or, if in an unincorporated area, the County apply to the Assessor
for certification of the area as one in need of substantial revitalization;

(3)

Upon receiving an application to certify an area as in need of substantial
revitalization, the Assessor shall review the application, supporting data and other
appropriate factors relevant to a determination of the severity of the economic
conditions of the area. In determining whether the "in need of substantial
revitalization" requirement is met, the Assessor shall give strong consideration and
substantial weight to the fact that an area is located in a Federal empowerment
zone or enterprise community, as proposed and approved by the County Board on
June 22, 1994, or the Chicago City Council on May 18, 1994.

(j)
Upon finding that existing factors convincingly demonstrate that the area is in need of
substantial revitalization, as defined in this Division, the Assessor shall grant such certification to the area.
In making this determination statistical data relevant to the surrounding area as well as the specific area for
which certification is sought may be considered. The surrounding area for the City of Chicago shall be the
community area as defined in this Division; for all other areas in the County it shall be, where applicable,
the municipality in which the area is located.

Take-home assignment. A County vehicle other than a passenger vehicle may be
assigned to employees in a service, management or supervisory position on call 24
hours a day, responsible for providing or supporting emergency services. A county
passenger vehicle may be assigned to an employee as a take-home vehicle only
where the employee travels frequently after-hours on behalf of the County, and it
is less expensive to assign a take-home vehicle rather than reimburse the employee
for use of a personal vehicle. There is a strong presumption against any take-home
passenger vehicle assignments. A vehicle disclosure form shall be used and remain
on file in the Department for all "take-home" vehicles.

(2)

Approval of take-home passenger vehicle assignments. All current passenger
vehicle assignments are subject to the review and approval of the Vehicle Steering
Committee. All future take home vehicle assignments require the prior approval

when the County work assignment requires a vehicle in order to properly conduct
County business. A vehicle disclosure form and daily log shall be used and remain
on file in the Department for all pool vehicles which are taken home overnight.
Those employees authorized for overnight use of County vehicles shall, when
away from work for an extended period of time, for vacation, sick leave,
compensatory time off, travel, etc., return the assigned County vehicle to the
custody of his/her department head during the period of absence.

No person shall be authorized to drive a County vehicle unless he/she:
1.

Possesses a current, valid driver's license with the correct class for
the vehicle driven.

2.

Is the age of 18 or older.

3.

Meets rental requirements as specified by rental/leasing agencies.

4.

Is free of any prior convictions for driving while under the
influence of alcohol or drugs, or of reckless driving within the
previous year. Employees operating a commercial vehicle must
comply with all of the requirements of the Commercial Motor
Vehicle Safety Act of 1986.

5.

Any employee performing work which requires the operation of a
County-owned vehicle or a private vehicle at County expense
shall notify his/her immediate supervisor immediately of any
current restrictions or changes in driving privileges, including, but
not limited to, revocation, suspension, cancellation, denial,
Restricted Driving Permit, Judicial Driving Permit, Probationary
License, Family Financial Responsibility Driving Permit, leaving
the scene of an accident, refusal or neglect to report a traffic
accident, traffic violations, unpaid traffic citations, failure of

vehicle titled in the employee's name to pass the vehicle emissions
testing, or unpaid parking citations for a vehicle titled in the
employee's name. Any restrictions or changes to driving
privileges shall be reported by the employee to the employee's
Bureau Chief or Elected Official immediately and a record
maintained in the department. Any employee who fails to report,
and/or continues to operate a vehicle in the performance of County
duties, is subject to disciplinary action up to and including
termination from County employment.
b.

Use of private vehicles for County business:
1.

County employees, with the prior permission of their Department
Head, may use their private vehicle to conduct official County
business. Department Heads shall only approve the use of private
vehicles for County business when it is in the best interest of the
County to do so.

2.

A valid proof of insurance is required to operate a private vehicle,
which includes coverage of passengers and a copy must be kept in
the vehicle and must be filed with the Department's Vehicle
Coordinator.

3.

Employees authorized to use their personal vehicles for County
business shall comply with the following insurance requirements:
(i)

County employees who drive a private vehicle for official
County business shall have at least the minimum auto
insurance for private vehicles as required by the State of
Illinois.

(ii)

The employee's vehicle insurance policy must be issued
by a company that is licensed by the department of
insurance for the issuing state.

(iii)

In the event a County employee is involved in an accident
while driving his/her own vehicle, the employee's
personal insurance provides the primary coverage.

(iv)

Mileage reimbursement rates will be based on the Cook
County Travel and Expense Reimbursement Policy.

Sec. 2-674. - Miscellaneous rules.
(a)
Traffic laws and regulations. Drivers of County vehicles shall observe all traffic laws and
regulations. Drivers and passengers in County vehicles shall wear seat belts at all times and shall observe
safe driving practices. All drivers of a County vehicle involved in accidents and those who have been fined
for or charged with a traffic violation may be required to attend a driving safety training class.

163

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

March 22, 2017

Engine idling. Except for purposes of law enforcement including, but not limited to,
surveillance and radar gun use activities, the driver of a County vehicle must turn off the engine upon
stopping at a destination and must not cause or allow an engine to idle at any location for more than five
consecutive minutes or a period or periods aggregating more than five minutes in any one-hour period,
except when idling is absolutely necessary for the conduct of County business, for personal safety, or to
comply with traffic laws and law enforcement personnel.
(d)
Liability for damages. The County shall not be liable for injuries or damages arising from
activities outside the scope of employment including, but not limited to, personal use of rented vehicles by
employees during a County-authorized business trip. Any damages arising from these circumstances are
the responsibility of the employee. To the extent that the County incurs financial liability for the acts of
employees which occur outside the scope of employment, Cook County reserves the right to seek
reimbursement from the responsible person.
(e)
Insurance. The State of Illinois requires that all vehicles have an Illinois Insurance Card at
all times. The County Self-Insurance Program is administered by the Department of Risk Management
General Liability Division, which will issue a proof of insurance card for each County-owned vehicle. Only
vehicles which are included in the County (owned) vehicle inventory shall be registered with the
Department of Risk Management for insurance purposes.
(f)
Traffic violations. Employees shall be held personally responsible for all parking and/or
traffic violations incurred while operating a county owned or leased vehicle. The applicable employing
Department shall seek reimbursement on behalf of Cook County for County paid parking or traffic
violations from the employee responsible for the County paid parking or traffic violation. Failure of an
employee to reimburse the County for such offense shall be deemed a major cause infraction and result in
discipline up to and including termination. At no time will County funds be used directly or indirectly to
pay or reimburse an employee for parking or traffic violations.
(g)
Article not intended to enlarge current County liability, etc., to employees. Nothing in this
article is intended or shall be construed to extend or enlarge the obligations, liability, or responsibilities that
the County currently has to employees, or third parties, by law or contract, if any, in regard to the operation
of motor vehicles.
Effective date: This Ordinance Amendment shall be in effect immediately upon adoption.
Approved and adopted this 22nd of March 2017.

THE HONORABLE TONI PRECKWINKLE,
PRESIDENT OF THE COOK COUNTY BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS
FOR THE LEVY OF TAXES FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2017
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners and the Committee on Finance of the Board of Commissioners
of Cook County, Illinois, have considered the subject of the Annual Tax Levy for the Fiscal Year A.D.,
2017, and the several sums necessary to be levied to meet the needs and requirements of the County of
Cook for said fiscal year, and have recommended that this Ordinance for the Levy of Taxes be adopted;
and
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of Cook County, Illinois, approved, passed, and adopted the
Annual Appropriation Bill of the County of Cook, for its Fiscal Year 2017, which said Appropriation Bill
is hereinafter set forth and which contains a Revenue Estimate that includes an allocation of the 2017 Tax
Levy by Fund together with additional columns captioned: “ANNUAL TAX LEVY”, “APPROPRIATION
ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTED TAXES” and "NET TAX LEVY FOR APPROPRIATION "; and
WHEREAS, Cook County and its taxpayers have benefited from Tax Increment Financing Districts (TIFs)
by having the increment generated during the life of the TIFs invest in the specific area generating the
increment; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board passed a Resolution on November 15, 2011 outlining that it is the
policy of Cook County to recapture any property taxes at the termination of a TIF; and
WHEREAS, within the County of Cook, certain real-estate parcels, or a portion of the assessed valuation
of certain real-estate parcels, are from time to time identified on the County real-estate tax rolls as deriving
from new property, insofar as they were developed or substantially improved or are the subject of tax
incentives that expired since the most recent assessment of real-estate taxes, the value of which has not
heretofore been recaptured; and
WHEREAS, the interests of County taxpayers and the County itself are better served if the taxes on the
additional value of said new property is captured.
THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED AND ORDERED BY THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF
COOK COUNTY, ILLINOIS, that pursuant to its home rule powers, $720,483,542.00 as a base levy
amount, plus a TIF value recapture sum of $17,022,794, an expiring incentives sum of $982,238, and a
new-property value capture sum of $18,808,848, which aggregate amount of these sums is to be collected
from the Annual Tax Levy for the Fiscal Year A.D. 2017 of the County of Cook for the Corporate Fund
purposes of said County, and for the Public Safety Fund purposes of said County, and for the Health
Enterprise Fund purposes of said County, and for the payment of principal and interest on general obligation
bonds of said County as represented by the Bond and Interest fund purposes, and for Cook County
Employees Annuity and Benefit Fund purposes, and for the Election Fund purposes, and for Capital
Projects purposes, said aggregate amount being $757,297,422, which is the total amount of appropriations
heretofore legally made from the Annual Tax Levy for the year 2017 and contained in the Annual
Appropriation Bill (hereinafter set forth in the Ordinance) for the Fiscal Year 2017 duly adopted by the
Board of Commissioners of Cook County on November 15, 2016, is hereby levied on and upon all taxable

property in the said County of Cook for the Fiscal Year 2017, provided that the sum of $21,286,674 herein
referenced for Capital Projects may be used solely for Corporate purposes, Public Safety purposes, Health
Enterprise purposes, and Election purposes.
As provided in the Fiscal Year 2017 Annual Appropriation Bill, three percent of the property tax levy
revenues separately allocated to the Public Safety Fund, Corporate Fund, Health Fund, and Election Fund
are to be made available to each Fund for purposes of covering the loss and cost of collecting taxes levied
for said Funds, for the amounts of taxes for which the nonpayment will result in forfeiture of real estate,
and for abatements in the amounts of such taxes as extended upon the collectors’ books. To ensure the
County meets its obligations for indebtedness as represented by the Bond and Interest Fund, and that the
actual collections of property taxes received by the Annuity and Benefit Fund are commensurate with the
amounts so levied, the County Clerk is authorized, in consultation with the County’s Chief Financial
Officer, to extend loss and collections for these funds in a manner that is sufficient for these purposes.
The specific amounts herein levied for the various purposes heretofore named are stated in this Ordinance
and Tax Levy, by being listed and itemized by Fund in the Revenue Estimate of the Annual Appropriation
Bill, including a column captioned: “ANNUAL TAX LEVY”. The tax hereby levied for said Fiscal Year

Summary: This report is to comply with the amendments to Article X of the Cook County Code
(PERFORMANCE BASED MANAGEMENT AND BUDGETING), approved by the Cook
County Board of Commissioners on June 29, 2016. The purpose of the amendments was to
enhance the effectiveness of the annual budget process by establishing administrative units called
“programs.” Amendments to Article X also created a new process for the submission of performance
data.
“Programs” were identified for the purpose of being the primary building blocks of an agency’s
or department’s budget request, making it possible to distinguish assigned employees and
costs
(i.e. inputs), and the resulting program performance metrics, i.e. outputs, outcomes, and
efficiency.
Performance data submission was to take the form of an Annual Report, with submittals being due
within 45 days of fiscal year end, by each County Department and Agency, and as part of its
annual Budget Request, as described in Section 2-933. The President or his or her designee, the

talent and create pathways for sector based experience and employment for young adults. The Program will
focus on sector specific paid training and/or paid work experience in areas which include transportation,
distribution and logistics; manufacturing; information technology; and other high-growth, high-demand
