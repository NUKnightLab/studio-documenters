legal process of these meetings and why we have to hold

18

these meetings:

19
20
21

On October 1st, 2018, CPS published draft
guidelines for school actions;
Prior to December 1st, 2018, CPS proposed

22

school actions and sent notice letters and draft

23

transition plans to parents and communities and staff;

24

January 2019 we have to hold two community

This is the second meeting.

The first one

6

That information is coming in a future slide

And then by February 2019 or later, CPS will

7

make recommendations to the Board after community

8

meetings and hearings or the Board will then vote on any

9

recommendations for school actions;

11

That vote can occur at the February board
meeting or later.

offer a high quality education to make Cooper a

successful school.

With this, parents for several years

Parents have said that they are content and

We have established a great

We need to offer what

9

Marissa Santiago and

Hello, good evening.

My name is

I am the parent and member of the LSC

I just want to mention that I was also made

10

aware that this year we had over 120 applicants at

11

Orozco and 80 -- over 80 children had to be turned away.

12

Having the proposed reassignment will allow

13

children from the southwest side of the city in schools

14

like Orozco such as my children.

15

I'm from McKinley Park, and the opportunities

16

that we had were very limited in the area for gifted

17

programs.

18

further south.

19
20
21

I had to go either far north or either

But being in Pilsen, in that area, I think it's
a great idea.
So that's it.

22

MS. CARRETO:

23

MS. SANTIAGO:

24

Thank you.

Can you do it in Spanish?
(Speaking Spanish.)

I can't even speak because I'm a little

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 16, 2019
Page 15

nervous.

I can't do it.

I'm so sorry.

2

MS. CARRETO:

That's okay.

3

MS. CARRETO:

(Interpretation in Spanish.)

4

MS. CAMERON:

(through the Interpreter) My children

5

started their education in Catholic schools, then they

6

went to Charter, and then they went to Magnet schools,

7

and they really liked them, and now they like it at CPS.

8
9

So I stayed with CPS, and then I moved to
Orozco.

When I started at Orozco Elementary, I saw the

10

change in my children in how they entered and finished

11

school because they -- it's the school, so it's the

12

principal and having a school and the parents with our

13

children.

14

And right now I see that all of my kids are --

15

are doing well and they have the fundamentals to do that

16

at their elementary school.

17

So that's why I love CPS.

And right now Orozco Elementary, the principal

18

has a psychologist as full time for the school.

19

have had a lot of different activities and afterschool

20

programs, and the kids also have socioemotional

21

behaviors with all the kids in the school.

22

We also

And for the final, I just want to say thank you

23

to all the people that have prepared us in the process

24

of doing this.

It's not easy thinking this is the best

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 16, 2019
Page 16

for our students.

2

students have the opportunity for the Spanish students

3

inside in the city to have an opportunity.

Thank you.

I just want to make a note.

Do you mind repeating the names of the parents
when they are called?
She's going to repeat the names now.

11

MS. CARRETO:

12

MS. DE PAZ:

Nomisol De Paz.
(through the Interpreter) Good evening.

13

My name is Monisol De Paz, and I'm here today because

14

I'm supporting the project and special need I also have

15

at public schools; that this is a very important program

16

for our students.

17

The majority of our schools in this district,

18

Chicago Public Schools, they have an eighth grade, but

19

in our school here, I didn't know that they only had

20

until fifth grade.

21

I felt really mad about it because I had to

22

leave from the school with my student crying because I

23

came to the school and they said they didn't have the

24

grade that they had, and my child said that he wasn't

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 16, 2019
Page 17
1

accepted, he wasn't wanted here.

2

in Catholic school and the same option for him.

3

So my child before was

So they told me I could go back and pay for

4

Catholic school, but then after that I felt, with the

5

school, I found what I was looking for, the education

6

was of high quality in this school.

7

I feel that in this school my children should

8

graduate from eighth grade, and instead of me returning

9

to the school that I was with, I want my students to be

10

here at this school in eighth grade because here I feel

11

good with my children and I feel that we're a family and

12

this is an opportunity for my kids.

13

community here.

14

There's love and

So I direct myself right now with

15

Chicago Public Schools to hear my petition.

16

right for children to have a school for them to

17

graduate.

18

from all the districts across the country.

19
20
21

This is

There's all the schools have an eighth grade

good night, Everybody.

up to eighth grade.

4

I'm here to support the expansion of

I think this is a -- a great opportunity.

I

5

really commend the parents for having worked together

6

with their principal and teachers to embrace this

7

change.

8
9
10
11

I believe that this is a big win and it's a
win-win for Orozco and Cooper because Orozco also gets
to expand its bilingual gifted program.
Let me say that I am -- I'm a little bit -- I

12

am not nervous, but I'm a little bit moved because this

13

school needs a lot to me.

14

six children attended, this is the school where I got my

15

GED, and this is the school where I began my first year

16

of teaching career from which I have retired in the last

six months.

This is the school where my

MS. HERNANDEZ:

12

Hello.

My name is Montsserrat Hernandez, and

13

I'm here presenting as a parent, and I'm here to address

14

my support for the additional middle school grades to

15

Cooper School.

16

And I want to first talk to something that

17

Mr. Alfredo Calderon said, which was that there's always

18

been discussion with parents about why is there not a

19

sixth, seventh an eighth grade already.

20

I've had the fortunate of working with Cooper

21

through the parent component for about ten years before

22

becoming a parent here, and it's something that I've

23

been hearing for ten years now; I wish my kids could

24

stay, I wish my kids didn't have to go to another

school.
And then, as an art teacher, I heard it from

3

the students, you know; I don't want to leave, I wish I

4

could stay.

5
6
7

So I think that this -- it's time, it's time,
it's due for an upgrade in the grade continuity.
I also think that it's really important that we

8

can offer those students some sort of support through

9

what's already a very hard traditional time.

They're

10

going through their pre-teens, they're really going

11

through a lot of socioemotional changes.

12

offer them a little bit of support by letting them stay

13

in a space where they really feel safe and loved and

14

happy, I think that would do great -- be good for them.

15

So if we can

Also, the teachers at Cooper I believe are some

16

of the most amazing teachers that I've ever had the

17

grace of seeing and working with.

18

the school go above and beyond, and I think that you can

19

see that through the Board working with the students and

20

the love that they have for them.

21

The teachers here at

So if we can give the kids the opportunity to

22

stay with that, with those teachers, that would benefit

23

them greatly as well, and, last but not least, of

24

course, the principal, that's alway accessible to the

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 16, 2019
Page 21

parent, who's alway open to the needs of them and

2

supporting them however that she can them.

3

So I support this proposal.

4

Okay.

Thank you.

MS. CARRETO:

as part of the community because I have three children,

13

and the three of them already left Cooper Elementary,

14

but I'm still part of the Local School Council as a

15

community member, and I wanted to tell you that I am

16

supporting this process and the site of Cooper because

17

it's like my house even though my children are not here

18

anymore.

19

My name is Maria Ramirez, and I want to speak

This is the first place where they opened the

20

doors for me, they took me in their arms, and I was here

21

about -- like a volunteer for about 13 years, and I

22

wanted to tell you that I know this school very well,

23

the teachers and that I know that they deserve this

24

opportunity because they have worked really hard.

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

And I also want to tell you that I believe that

2

I understand very well because I've been inside the

3

classrooms and helping with the parents, and this is

4

where they gave me the first opportunity to work.

5

And thank you to the school, thank you to

6

Ms. Alba.

7

after ten years that I've been here.

8
9

This is how I got in contact with to help me

This school is not only for the kids.

It's

also for us as parents because they have always been

10

supporting our students and teach them, right, but they

11

also help us as parents, and they give us options on how

12

to help our students with their identification.

13

And this is why this is always going to be my

14

school even though my children are no longer here, but I

15

also support Orozco Elementary because two of my

16

children, the one graduated from Orozco, they were there

17

in middle school with Orozco Elementary, and they had

18

really good grades, and I give them changes because in

19

Cooper they have the fundamentals and they win with the

20

fundamentals.

21

My younger son has just started at Orozco, and

22

I'm really proud to be part of these two schools in

23

Pilsen because this is the best.

24

Thank you.

MS. MOLINA:

(through the interpreter) Good evening.

My name is Claudia Molina, and I come here as a parent.
My child started here at pre-k, and you feel

4

very happy and emotional when you start your child in a

5

school from little and you see the development that that

6

student has little by little.

7

And thank you to the teachers here that they

8

motivate him to do their better -- their best every day,

9

and thank you so much to the principal for always

10
11

supporting the children in that way.
And my petition is that the school extends to

12

eighth grade for the students because the students, it's

13

really hard for them to do that transition from one

14

school to another, and it's also hard for them.

15

It's hard for them because, when they're here,

16

they feel like they're at home, they see their teachers

17

and they just motivate the students, the way that they

18

teach the students, they motivate the students to learn

19

more and to just be better at everything that they do to

20

have the best grades possible and they motivate them in

21

a way that I feel happy that my students are here.

22

Thank you so much.

So I'm here today, and as I mentioned in the

last meeting, the pride that I have in all the families

9

of Orozco and Cooper all together coming to these

10

meetings and supporting this proposal and how beautiful

11

it is today that every person that has come here said

12

that their school accepts them, gives them love,

13

cherished them and that the children are learning.

14

What a great thing that the students are doing.

We want to applause the students and the

I'm the principal from here of Cooper, and I'm

And, really, I do not have much to say because

22

our parents and students have spoken here tonight and

23

they have shared with you why they wanted, why they want

24

sixth, seventh and eighth grade.

I do want to share with you guys because this

2

is a process that we're going to be adding each grade

3

one time each year to make sure that everything works,

4

and this is going to be a process, and I know that the

5

teachers, as the parents have said, are fantastic, and

6

they're going to work very hard to make sure that change

7

is good and that teachers, representative of all the

8

teachers, he said that the teachers are going to be

9

supporting that and working hard to do that.

10

The parents also came up here and said that

11

they're going to be supporting their kids, and, of

12

course, I will be here to continue supporting on every

13

step in the way.

14

So really thank you for coming here tonight,

15

and I really thank you with all the support of this, and

16

I also thank that Orozco is going to be very successful

17

and giving more opportunities to our students that they

18

want to have and education at that school.

My name is State Representative Theresa Mah.
And I'm really happy to support this proposal.

3

I was very happy to attend the CPS board meeting where I

4

spoke on behalf of the parents who were there to testify

5

about the proposal.

6

And I really want to say that, you know, one of

7

the main reasons why this is such a good idea is because

8

the ideas came from the parents and the community out of

9

several years of discussion where LSC members and the

10

parents came together to talk about what they really

11

wanted, and they became engaged and involved in this

12

process and let it be known that this is what they would

13

like to see as a vision for their community, and so it's

14

something that's really worth supporting.

15

I applaud the principals and the families and

16

community members of both schools for being involved in

17

this process and speeding it up and having your voices

18

heard, and I support you all the way.
