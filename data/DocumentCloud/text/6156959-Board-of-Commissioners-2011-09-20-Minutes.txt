(e)
Cook County agencies will fully incorporate Complete Streets into budgeting processes,

(g)
County Department of Highways (Highway Department) shall cooperate with

Sec. 66-105.

Guidelines.

enable safe access for all users, regardless of age, ability, or mode of transportation in all appropriate
transportation projects, including new construction, reconstruction, resurfacing, widening, and operations.
In furtherance of this goal, the Highway Department will:
1.

decisions and will develop an internal Complete Streets Policy no later than 90 days
following enactment of this ordinance.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 20, 2011
2.

Prioritize the safe movement of pedestrian, bicycle, and public transportation traffic in
decisions regarding the use of limited public right-of-way, with consideration given to
roadway context and land use.

3.

Define standards to measure the progress of implementation of this ordinance. Such
standards shall include, but not be limited to, improvements in safety for all roadway
users; increased capacity for all modes of transportation; miles of new and repaired
bicycle facilities; blocks of new and repaired sidewalks; number of new and repaired
marked street crossings; amount of new and repaired signage; number of new and
repaired curb ramps. Such measures shall be incorporated into relevant plans, manuals,
policies, processes and programs. The Highway Department shall work with other
departments and agencies to track such performance measures as appropriate.

4.

Revise its plans, manuals, rules, policies, processes and programs as appropriate to
incorporate any changes necessary to foster the timely implementation of Complete
Streets principles. Such plans, manuals, rules, policies, processes and programs shall be
reviewed upon enactment of this ordinance and no less frequently than every two years

(b)
Roadways Not Under the Jurisdiction of the Cook County Highway Department. All
relevant County agencies will review and revise as necessary their plans, manuals, policies, processes and
programs to foster the implementation of Complete Streets on roadways not under the jurisdiction of
Highway Department but subject to financing, regulation of or otherwise involving an action by any
county agency. Such projects shall include, but not be limited to, privately-built roadways and projects on
non-county roadways funded in part or entirely by county funds.
Sec. 66-106.

Exceptions.

This ordinance shall not apply if the Superintendent of Highways makes a written finding that
one or more of the following conditions apply:
(a)
The scope of the relevant project is limited to maintenance activities intended to keep the
roadway in serviceable condition. Resurfacing activities that are published in the multi-year plan may not
be considered a maintenance activity for this determination; or
(b)
There is sufficient documentation that there is no feasible way to accommodate
improvements for non-vehicular traffic within a project’s scope. Identified needs that are not included in a
project should be tracked and included in future capital projects. Such a finding is not authorized on
resurfacing projects if accommodations can be provided for non-motorized roadway users without
undertaking a full roadway reconstruction; or
(c)
There is no documented current or anticipated need for accommodation of non-motorized
roadway users or the road is not a current or planned transit route. Such a finding is not authorized if the
relevant roadway corridor is identified in a transportation plan of any government agency, including
agencies outside the jurisdiction of Cook County, as a corridor anticipated for the future benefit of any
non-motorized transportation or transit user.

requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to increase by $1,400,000 Contract No. 1084-129 with Warehouse Direct, Mount Prospect, Illinois, for Countywide Office Supplies.
Board approved amount 09-01-10:
Increase requested:
Adjusted amount:
Reason:

$1,373,256.50
1,400,000.00
$2,773,256.50

The original award amount of $1,373,256.50 has been encumbered by Cook
County departments through various purchase orders prior to the one year
contract anniversary. Based on analysis of the contract, usage history and annual
spend, it appears that the initial amount requested was for a one-year period, not
a two-year period. In order to continue operation of County services, the contract
will need to be increased by an additional $1,400,000. The expiration date of the
current contract is September 14, 2012.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $1,400,000.00. (Various-350 Accounts)
Approval of this item would commit Fiscal Year 2012 funds.

DISCUSSION ON THE PENSION MULTIPLIER CHANGE FOR SPECIAL
PURPOSE FUNDS AND GRANTS (PROPOSED RESOLUTION). Submitting a Proposed
Resolution sponsored by Bridget Gainer, County Commissioner.
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
DISCUSSION ON THE PENSION MULTIPLIER CHANGE
FOR SPECIAL PURPOSE FUNDS AND GRANTS
WHEREAS, the department of Budget and Management released a memo on August 18,
2011 to address the indirect cost rates to be used for grants and special purpose funds.
WHEREAS, the department of Budget and Management would like to ensure that the
general fund does not subsidize any indirect costs attributable to special purpose funds or
grants.
WHEREAS, it was determined by the department of Budget and Management that the
pension amount for special purpose funds should be calculated at the actuarial rate rather than
the required contribution rate.
WHEREAS, the change to an actuarial allocation model for pension contributions would
mean using a 4.95 multiplier instead of a 1.54 multiplier. The resulting impact will go from
13.09% to 42.07% for special purpose funds.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOVLED, that the Cook County Subcommittee on Pension
meet to discuss this change and it’s impact on the overall Cook County employer
contribution.
*Referred to the Finance Subcommittee on Pension on 09/07/11.

Vice Chairman Silvestri and Commissioners Butler, Garcia, Gorman, Goslin, Murphy,
Reyes and Sims (8).

Absent:

Chairman Steele (1).

Also Present:

Commissioner Daley; LaVerne Hall – Director of Contract Compliance

Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Committee on Contract Compliance of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County met pursuant
to notice on Thursday, September 8, 2011 at the hour of 9:30 A.M. in the Board Room, Room 569,
County Building, 118 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois.

75

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 20, 2011
Your Committee discussed the Quarterly Diversity Report pursuant to Communication Number 311628
which was heard by the Contract Compliance Committee on April 6, 2011. This discussion follows.
LaVerne Hall, Director of Contract Compliance, delivered an overview of the Quarterly Diversity Report
for the 2nd Quarter of 2011.
Vice Chairman Silvestri inquired whether the Ordinance exempts not-for-profits.
Ms. Hall replied that the Ordinance does not speak to this.
Commissioner Reyes asked Ms. Hall to discuss what the advantages are in being MBE/WBE certified.
Ms. Hall replied: The Office of Contract Compliance is working to add value so that certification acts as a
marketing tool for companies to secure work with major companies that are bidding as primary vendors;
additionally, the Office of Contract Compliance is starting to do “very specific outreach.” The Contract
Compliance Office is notifying the certified firms through e-alerts of opportunities that fall into their
areas of specialty.
Commissioner Reyes inquired whether there is a benefit to being a County-owned business.
Ms. Hall replied that the Office of Contract Compliance is asking primary vendors to work with
MBE/WBE firms from Cook County. She stated that, further, in the new Procurement Code, if a
MBE/WBE certified company’s bid is within 10% of the lowest bidder, the Office of Contract
Compliance has the ability to award the contract the MBE/WBE certified company. This is referred to as
“local preference.”
Commissioner Garcia inquired whether the Chicago Public Schools tracked the participation of not-forprofits and what Ms. Hall might recommend on this issue.
Ms. Hall replied that when she last worked at CPS, the organization was beginning to ask – although it
was not mandatory – whether not-for-profit vendors worked with minority owned firms.
Commissioner Daley inquired further into this issue.
Ms. Hall stated that the recommendation would be to start asking, at the time the solicitation is sent out,
whether the companies could participate in the program and, if so, to communicate that they would be
looked on favorably, although it would also be communicated that it would not be a strike against them if
they did not participate. Participation would be completely voluntary.
Commissioner Daley inquired as to whether, if a firm has not been reporting, they are still eligible to bid.
Ms. Hall replied: This is why she asked for deferral of payment in one case. It is her understanding that
non-compliant firms are not allowed to bid, and are considered non-responsive at the next bid. The
Office of Contract Compliance is currently researching three years back to determine who is noncompliant.
Commissioner Gorman inquired what percentage is required for compliance.
Ms. Hall replied: The Office of Contract Compliance is reviewing each company on a contract-bycontract basis, looking at availability. She believes this is one of the reasons that waivers requests are
currently low. One contract may have a 15% minority goal while another has a 30% minority goal. This

76

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 20, 2011
will depend on the availability of minorities in the marketplace. The Office of Contract Compliance does
have an “aspirational goal”.
Commissioner Gorman inquired what is the definition of a full waiver.
Ms. Hall replied that a full waiver is when there is no minority or women participation whatsoever.
Commissioner Gorman inquired as to the in-county and in-state incentives.
Ms. Hall replied that those firms that are in the County get a ten percent advantage; this is termed “local
preference.”
Commissioner Gorman inquired as to the certification process – does the Office of Contract Compliance
process the paperwork for this?
Ms. Hall replied: The Office of Contract Compliance is working diligently on this, and that they host a
workshop monthly. Applications can now be filed online. The Office of Contract Compliance is working
toward reciprocity with the City of Chicago, and several other entities. The goal for this is January of
2012.
Commissioner Sims asked for a description of Five Forward.
Ms. Hall replied: The Office of Contract Compliance is encouraging some of the major companies to find
ways to utilize minority firms in contracts other than their Cook County contracts, including contracts in
other states, so that these minority firms can grow their capacity in the marketplace. The Office of
Contract Compliance has requested that the Five Forward organization – a program under Chicago United
– monitor any growth and report it to the Office of Contract Compliance. Five Forward will be
responsible for tracking how the company has grown its market share, if additional jobs have been created
and if they have had revenue growth.
Commissioner Sims inquired as to the supposed $900 joining fee for Five Forward, and whether this is
the norm.
Ms. Hall replied that this is not her understanding. She agreed to Vice Chairman Silvestri’s request that
she present the Committee with a written report on this issue.
Commissioner Sims inquired as to what type of organization Five Forward is.
Ms. Hall replied that it is a not-for-profit organization, designed to promote local minority- and womenowned firms.
Commissioner Sims inquired as to who the CEO of the organization is.
Ms. Hall replied, Gloria Castillo.
Commissioner Sims inquired whether the agenda could include the names of the MBE/WBE vendors.
Ms. Hall agreed to include this information on her quarterly reports on a going-forward basis.
Matthew B. DeLeon, Secretary to the Cook County Board of Commissioners, agreed to speak with the
Clerk’s Office on the issue of including names of MBE/WBE firms in agenda backup.

77

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 20, 2011

Commissioner Sims inquired as to what certification other than the County’s is currently accepted by the
Office of Contract Compliance.
Ms. Hall listed the following certifications that are currently accepted by the Office of Contract
Compliance: City of Chicago, CMBDC, WBDC and SBA 8 (A).
Commissioner Murphy inquired as to the nature of indirect participation.
Ms. Hall explained that this is when a Cook County MBE/WBE firm is used, but not on a Cook County
contract.
Commissioner Murphy inquired as to what type of entity Tall Grass is.
Ms. Hall replied that this is a technology firm, and that they are using a women-owned firm in an indirect
matter. She further noted that she tracks indirect participation separately from direct participation, so as
not to inflate the direct participation numbers.
Commissioner Murphy inquired as to whether a firm that is deemed non-compliant is able to bid on
another project.
Ms. Hall replied: She makes a recommendation to the Chief Purchasing Officer, who determines whether
to deem them non-responsive the next time they bid. There have been cases where a non-compliant
company has been allowed to bid on another contract. There is, however, in the new Procurement Code,
language which deals with this issue, and prohibits eligibility to bid in such cases.
Commissioner Sims voiced her concern over companies that initially work with minority or womenowned firms in order to win a contract and then, in the middle of their contract, drop this firm or scale
back on the percentage of WBE or MBE they are using, and are never caught by the County.
Ms. Hall replied that this is why payment reporting is so important. She further stated that in such cases,
she is meeting with the companies and holding them accountable, and in some cases is withholding
payment until the company is back in compliance.
Commissioner Reyes inquired whether there has been any development in creating a waiver committee.
Ms. Hall replied in the negative, and further stated that requests for waivers are diminishing.
Vice Chairman Silvestri state that he, Miss Hall and Commissioner Steele will meet to discuss the
formation of a Waivers Committee when Commissioner Steele returns.
Commissioner Reyes moved to adjourn the meeting, seconded by Commissioner Murphy. The
motion carried and the meeting was adjourned.

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
On August 22, 2011 the account balances were:
(050-190 Account) (-) $953.00 (050-240 Account) $25,241.00*
(050-388 Account) (-) $530.00 (050-440 Account) $259.00

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from ______.
None.

4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
All of the accounts were budgeted for what we spent in FY2010 and what we anticipated to spend
in FY2011. Due to the large volume of appeals we received this year; we had to postpone all
seminars and classes (050-186 Account). Membership fees (050-185 Account) were prorated due
to one of the Commissioners coming in February. The Board had fewer meetings which impacted
the number of times we needed a court reporter (050-268 Account) and we spent less on advertising
(050-245) because we opened larger groups of towns at one time. We are anticipating to have
larger mailings after November (050-225Account).

Commissioner Daley, seconded by Commissioner Sims, moved that the transfer of funds be approved.
The motion carried unanimously.
