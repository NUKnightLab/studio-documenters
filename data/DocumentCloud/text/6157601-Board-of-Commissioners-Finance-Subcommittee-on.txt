PURPOSE FUNDS AND GRANTS (PROPOSED RESOLUTION). Submitting a
Proposed Resolution sponsored by Bridget Gainer, County Commissioner.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION

DISCUSSION ON THE PENSION MULTIPLIER CHANGE
FOR SPECIAL PURPOSE FUNDS AND GRANTS
WHEREAS, the department of Budget and Management released a memo on August 18,
2011 to address the indirect cost rates to be used for grants and special purpose funds.

WHEREAS, the department of Budget and Management would like to ensure that the
general fund does not subsidize any indirect costs attributable to special purpose funds or
grants.

WHEREAS, it was determined by the department of Budget and Management that the
pension amount for special purpose funds should be calculated at the actuarial rate rather
than the required contribution rate.

WHEREAS, the change to an actuarial allocation model for pension contributions would
mean using a 4.95 multiplier instead ofa 1.54 multiplier. The resulting impact will go from
13.09% to 42.07% for special purpose funds.

NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOVLED, that the Cook County Subcommittee on
Pension meet to discuss this change and it?s impact on the overall Cook County employer
contribution.

Dear Commissioner Gainer:

Pursuant to the request by the Board of Trustees, enclosed is our actuary?s analysis of the impact of
Senate Bill 512.

In reviewing the results of these projections, the Trustees have come to the conclusion that Senate Bill
512 will not solve the Fund's long term funding issues. In addition the provision in Senate Bill 512 that
freezes the employer contribution at 2009 level would exacerbate the problem. Projections show the
Fund exhausting assets sooner than if no legislative action is taken.

Finally it appears that any solution to the problem will need to include additional funding. Every

projection that the actuary has done this year shows the Fund eventually running out of assets unless
there is a contribution increase.

The Trustees appreciate the opportunity to present these results to the committee and hope to
participate in discussions involving solutions to the future health of the Fund.

Sincerely,

(TE (be!

Re: Funding Projections for Senate Bill 512

Dear Dan'

As requested. we have performed funding projections based on the bene?t and employee and
employer contribution provisions contained in Senate Bill 512.

Ema-wry ofBene?t Provisions ol'Senate Bill 512
Employees hired before January 1, 201 are given a choice to elect to participate in one ofthe
following retirement programs by January 1, 2013: the traditional bene?ts provided prior to

Public Act 96-0889. (2) the revised bene?ts provided to new employees under Public Act 96-0889,
(3) a self-managed plan.

Employees hired on or after January 1? 201 1 are given a choice to elect to participate in one ofthe
retirement programs under items (2) and (3) above by Januaiy 1, 2013.

S_ummarv of bringing Provisions ofthe Bill

 

Employer Contributions

Starting in 2013? the amount of tax to be levied shall be equal to the amount levied in 2009. As
requested, we have also performed some alternate projections assuming that the tax levy in future
years remains as under current law.

Participant Contributions

Participants who elect the traditional de?ned bene?t package shall contribute a percentage ofsalary
equal to the sum of(A), (B) detennined as follows:

(A) An amount equal to the greater of(1) 6% ofthe payroll ofsuch employee, or (2) one-halfof
the actuarially determined normal cost of the revised de?ned bene?t package
(B) An additional percentage ofsalaiy that is actuarially determined to be equal to the

Page 2

difference between the normal cost ofthe traditional plan and the normal cost ofthe revised
bene?t package. That additional percentage shall be based on the ?scal year 201 1
contribution and updated every three years thereafter, however, in no case shall the
employee contributions exceed 13.09% ofsalary.

Based on the December 31. 2010 actuarial valuation, we estimate the required employee
contribution for participants who elect the traditional bene?t package to be 13.09% ofsalary

Participants who elect the revised de?ned bene?t package shall contribute an amount equal to the
greater of(l) 7% ofsalary or (2) one-halfofthe actuarially determined normal cost ofthe revised
de?ned benefit package. The actuarially determined normal cost of the reformed bene?t package
Shall be based on the ?scal year 201 1 contribution and shall be updated every 3 years thereafter.

Based on the December 31, 2010 actuarial valuation, we estimated the required employee
contribution for participants who elect the revised bene?t package to be 7% of salary.

Participants who elect the self?managed plan shall make contributions of 6% of salary.

Mgga?ellilsed in Pertitrnnir'rg the Funding I?rnieclinns
We used the following approach in performing our funding projections for Senate Bill 512

1. We used the results ofthe December 31, 2010 actuarial valuations as a starting point in
performing our funding projections. That is, we used the same membership data and actuarial
assumptions that were used in performing the December 31, 2010 actuarial valuations, except for
any special assumptions indicated below.

2. Based on an analysis performed by Aon Hewitt for the Civic Committee, we have adopted the

following assumptions regarding employees who would transfer from the traditional de?ned bene?t
plan to the revised de?ned bene?t plan:

A. Employees who are over age 45 and employees who are between age 40 and age 45 and

whose annual salary is over $100.000 were assruned to remain under the traditional de?ned
bene?t plan.

B. All other employees were assumed to transfer to the revised de?ned bene?t plan.

3. We assumed that all employees who transferred from the traditional de?ned benefit plan would

GOLDSTEIN ASSOCIATES

Actuaries and Consultants

Mr. Dan Degnan
August 11,2011
Page 3

transfer to the revised de?ned bene?t plan. We therefore did not make any speci?c assumptions
about employees transferring to the self-managed plan. Whether an employee transfers to the
revised de?ned bene?t plan or the self-managed plan would be relatively cost neutral for the
employer and the fund. Therefore, having some employees transfer to the self-managed plan
instead ofthe revised de?ned bene?t plan would not have any signi?cant impact on the results of
our ?nding projections.

However, having some employees transfer to the self-managed plan instead of the revised de?ned
bene?t plan may create some cash flow problems for the fund. The contributions that would have
come into the ?Jnd from such employees would now not be coming into the fund and would
therefore not be available to be used for bene?t payments. The fund may therefore need to revise
its asset allocation policy to insure that there is suf?cient cash flow to meet bene?t payments.
Examining the impact ofsuch potential cash flow issues is not within the scope ofthis analysis.

Results of Our Funding Pro'eLctions

The results ofour funding projections with the tax levy as provided under Senate Bill 512 as well as
with the tax levy as under current law are summarized in Tables 19 and 20 which are attached.

If you have any questions regarding the attached results ofthe ?Jnding projections, please let me

know.

Yours Sincere.
