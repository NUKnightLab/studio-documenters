Steps to Improvement
 CMS HCAHPS survey is administered to a random sample of patients across the hospital,
CMS then applies patient mix adjustments based of service line, patient demographics, and
self-reported health status.
 Scores for medicine patients are not adjusted, while scores for surgical and labor patients
are adjusted down due to tendency for these patient groups to respond more positively.

Review 2018 YTD Grievance/Complaint Data
Michael Hanse, Supervisor Patient Relations,
Office of Patient Experience



Focus for the next steps: Low performing Medicine units are strategically important for
improvement of MetroHealth CMS rating, due to high patient/survey volume and CMS
methodology.

CMS Regulations and Interpretive Guidelines for Hospitals

§482.13 Condition of Participation: Patient's Rights

o

482.13(a)(2) The hospital must establish a process for prompt resolution of patient grievances
and must inform each patient whom to contact to file a grievance.



Grievance Definition: A formal or informal written (including emails and faxes) or verbal complaint
(including telephone following discharge) that is made to the hospital by a patient, or the patient's
representative, regarding:



Patient Relations Calls 2015 – 2018
