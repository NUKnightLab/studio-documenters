 Public Health Emergency  
Preparedness Events 
• 
• 
• 
• 

7 

Bioterrorism (e.g. Anthrax attack) 
Pandemics (e.g. H1N1 influenza) 
Natural disasters (e.g. floods, tornadoes) 
Man-made disasters (e.g. chemical spills) 

 Why is our work important? 
Consider pandemic influenza… 
•  CCDPH would be required to ensure vaccination of the 
entire Suburban Cook County population  
–  Using Strategic National Stockpile assets (i.e. vaccine) 
–  Requires many medical professionals, volunteers & space 
–  Requires extensive planning, training and exercising at 
the county and local (community) levels 
–  Partner relations are key to the success of preparedness 
and response work! 
•  Cook County government agencies, municipal leadership, 
first responder community
