Projects
Brownfield Plan for Mack and Conner
Mr. Vosburg introduced the Brownfield Plan for Mack and Conner to the CAC members present.
Project Introduction
The Detroit Brownfield Redevelopment Authority (DBRA), is the project developer (the “Developer”) for the
Plan. The DBRA will conduct eligible activities to prepare the Property (defined below) for redevelopment
and then transfer the Property to Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) or a related entity. Investigation and
remediation activities will be conducted to prepare the Property for a $1.6 billion investment that will revive
and expand FCA’s existing Mack Engine II Plant which will produce a new generation of Jeep cars and
SUVs to keep the company competitive in the evolving international market. FCA hopes to reopen the plant
by late 2020.
The Targeted Redevelopment Area (TRA) includes 276 adjacent parcels, including the Mack Engine Plant,
which will undergo significant redevelopment activities to prepare for and support the Mack Engine Plant
expansion. The redevelopment will have enormous economic impacts and remove blight conditions
persistent throughout the area. City of Detroit City Council and the Michigan Strategic Fund must designate
the TRA.
The total investment is estimated to be $1.6 billion. The Developer is requesting $200,087,692.00 in TIF
reimbursement, however only $33,526,056.00 in TIF Reimbursement is projected to be captured for the life
of the Plan.
It is estimated that approximately 2,300 temporary construction jobs and new 3,850 FTE jobs will be created
as a result of the FCA expansions at the Mack Engine II Plant.
Property Subject to the Plan
The eligible property (the “Property”) includes a 276-parcel TRA, 8 parcels to the south along the Detroit
River and two parcels to the north of the TRA. The Property is located on the east side of Detroit, south of
I-94 and west of Conner Street.
Basis of Eligibility
The Property is considered “eligible property” as defined by Act 381, Section 2 because (a) the Property
was previously utilized or is currently utilized for commercial, residential and/or industrial purposes; (b) it is
located within the City of Detroit, a qualified local governmental unit under Act 381; and (c) the parcels
which comprise the Property are included within the TRA; or (d) if the parcel is not within the TRA, the

 parcel has been determined to be a “facility,” functionally obsolete, blighted as defined by Act 381, or is
adjacent and contiguous to one of the “facilities,” functionally obsolete, or blighted parcels.
Eligible Activities and Projected Costs
The “eligible activities” that are intended to be carried out at the Property are considered “eligible activities”
as defined by Sec 2 of Act 381, because they include Department Specific Activities (i.e. due care
investigations, due care planning, soil remediation, dewatering and underground storage tank removal),
property acquisition for economic development purposes, demolition, site preparation activities and public
infrastructure improvements as well as the preparation and implementation of a brownfield plan and Act
381 work plan. The eligible activities and budgeted costs are intended as part of the development of the
Property and will be financed solely by the Developer. The eligible activities are estimated to commence
within 18 months of approval of the Plan and be completed within 3 years after approval of the Michigan
Strategic Fund work plan, if applicable, or 3 years after execution of the Reimbursement Agreement.
Tax Increment Financing (TIF) Capture
The Developer desires to be reimbursed for the costs of eligible activities. Tax increment revenue
generated by the Property will be captured by the DBRA and used to reimburse the cost of the eligible
activities completed on the Property after approval of this Plan pursuant to the terms of a Reimbursement
Agreement with the DBRA.

residents as anticipated. Mr. Stallworth stated that FCA will comply with the collective bargaining agreement
with UAW. Mr. Razo stated that FCA has a commitment to give Detroit residents first priority for the jobs
created by the project for the next 30 years and not only for the first round of hiring when the project is
completed.
Mr. Rawls asked if there have been efforts to prepare land near the project for suppliers to locate their
facilities there. Mr. Stallworth stated that the City of Detroit has been making efforts to prepare land within
the City so that it is ready and available for suppliers to locate near the project.
Mr. Rawls asked if FCA has been working with Southeastern High School to create training programs. Mr.
Stallworth stated that FCA has been working with Southeastern High School to become an advanced
manufacturing school in order to increase the enrollment and that FCA is giving the school a grant of $1
million which will be matched by other institutions and along with other donations to make a significant
investment in the school and the new programs. Mr. Stallworth also stated that FCA is also partnering with
Wayne County Community College to create an advanced manufacturing program which will result in
Associate degrees. FCA will also be hosting a manufacturing day at Southeastern High School and will be
offering an internship program to the students at the school.

Mr. Razo asked if DTE is responsible for the eligible activities at the Conner Creek property. Mr. Vosburg
stated that DTE will be demolishing the power plant at the Conner Creek property and following all clean
up requirements mandated by the State of Michigan for power plants. The DBRA doesn’t know the extent
of DTE’s demolition scope at this time. It is anticipated that the DBRA will have to perform some additional
site preparation and environmental remediation activities after DTE finished the demolition anticipated to
be complete by February 2020.
Mr. Rawls asked who the project team was for the project. Mr. Vosburg stated that AKT Peerless, SME,
DLZ, and, Mannik & Smith, Angelo Iafrate, Blaze Contracting, the City of Detroit and DEGC staff all
performed services for the project.
Mr. Rawls asked if there will be more Detroit-based contractors working on the project in the future. Mr.
Vosburg confirmed that there will be more Detroit-based contractors working on the project in the future
and that it is anticipated that pieces of the project may be broken into smaller parts that may be easier for
smaller Detroit-based contractors to bid on. The DBRA is following the applicable Executive Orders.
