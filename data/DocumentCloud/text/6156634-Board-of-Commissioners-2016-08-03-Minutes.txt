and social equality; and

RESOLUTION
Sponsored by
THE HONORABLE TONI PRECKWINKLE,
PRESIDENT OF THE COOK COUNTY BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS
IN SUPPORT OF THE WHITE HOUSE’S DATA DRIVEN JUSTICE INITIATIVE
WHEREAS, in July 2016 the White House launched the Data Driven Justice Initiative which focuses on
utilizing “data-driven strategies to divert low-level offenders with mental illness out of the criminal justice
system and change approaches to pre-trial incarceration, so that low-risk offenders no longer stay in jail
simply because they cannot afford a bond”; and
WHEREAS, “these innovative strategies, which have measurably reduced jail populations in several
communities, help stabilize individuals and families, better serve communities, and often save money in
the process”; and
WHEREAS, the Data Driven Initiative is supported by a coalition of 67 city, county, and state
Page 18 of 206

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

governments; and
WHEREAS, the bipartisan coalition includes the state of Illinois, Champaign County, Lake County, and
McLean County, Illinois as well as Los Angeles County, California, Miami-Dade County, Florida, Ramsey
County, Minnesota, Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, Camden County, New Jersey, Bexar County,
Texas, King County, Washington, Denver, Colorado and New York, New York; and
WHEREAS, the Data Driven Initiative “encourages communities to implement strategies proven to be
effective in reducing unnecessary incarceration in jails such as using data to identify and proactively break
the cycle of incarceration, specifically to bring data together from across criminal justice and health systems
to identify individuals with the highest number of contacts with police, ambulance, emergency departments,
and other services, and link them to health, behavioral health, and social services in the community, with a
goal of reducing overreliance on emergency healthcare and encounters with the criminal justice system”;
and
WHEREAS, “the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority and the Illinois Health and Hospital
Association have committed to collaborating to host a convening of participating and interested Illinois
counties to help identify opportunities for engagement with hospitals and relevant stakeholders at the local
level to share best practices to reduce hospital readmissions and preventable emergency-room visits, and
improve health”; and
WHEREAS, the National Association of Counties (NACo), The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur
Foundation and the National Alliance on Mental Illness have committed to working with the White House
Data Driven Initiative.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and the Cook County Board of
Commissioners support the White House Data Driven Initiative and encourage Cook County government’s
public safety stakeholders, namely the offices of the Chief Judge, Clerk of the Circuit Court, Public
Defender, Sheriff and State’s Attorney as well as the Cook County Health and Hospitals System to work
collaboratively through the Cook County Justice Advisory Council to further the goals of the initiative.

5/4/2016 was $39,267.00
How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
These accounts were chosen to be used for the sources of funds because of the amount of unencumbered

Presented by: ZAHRA ALI, Director, Department of Revenue
PROPOSED TRANSFER OF FUNDS
Department: Department of Revenue
Request: Transfer of Funds
Reason: Funds will be used to purchase cigarette tax stamps. The previous vendor no longer provides
printing of stamps and there is an increased cost with the new vendor. Annually, cigarette tax generates an
estimated $134 million. Also, funds will be used for equipment and computer supplies needed for the
Collections, Compliance and Audit divisions. The current equipment being used is more than 5 years old
and operates at substantially low speed. Replacement of the outdated desktops is required to efficiently
work with CCDOR’s Integrated Tax Processing System (ITPS).

From Account(s): 007- 260, $100,000.00
To Account(s): 007-240, $30,000.00; 007-388, $70,000.00
Total Amount of Transfer: $100,000.00
On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
It became apparent that the receiving account would require and infusion of funds in Q2. The cost of
printing the stamps is more than anticipated due to the fact that the original vendor no longer provides
these services.
It became apparent that updated computer equipment would be necessary to run the ITPS system at the
start of implementation of the project. In Q2 the department recognized that the performances on the
existing machines are extremely slow and they are no longer compatible with updated software,
Page 24 of 206

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

additionally the life-cycle of the equipment has ended.
How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
The department identified areas of efficiencies and process improvements that resulted in unused funds.
The primary account used for professional services that are no longer required
Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from.
None
If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
Originally, the department appropriated funds for a vendor to provide consulting and integration services
related to the implementation of our Integrated Tax Processing System. However, the department no
longer requires the services of the vendor as we have worked with Bureau of Technology to provide an
internal solution that meets the project needs and accomplished the integration necessary between the
cashiering and tax processing system.

Purpose: The purpose of the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency’s (IEPA) solid waste

Summary: The Department of Environmental Controls respectfully requests acceptance of the Illinois
Environmental Protection Agency’s (IEPA) solid waste enforcement grant.
The grant reimburses the county for activities performed during the 2016 state fiscal year. A delegation
agreement was previously agreed upon by both the IEPA and the Cook County Board (Board Agenda Item
15-3606 from 07/29/2015), grant funding was delayed due to the state budget impasse. Illinois EPA has
delegated its authority to inspect solid waste management facilities to several county agencies, the Ambraw
Valley Solid Waste Agency (for Crawford, Richland and Lawrence Counties) and the City of Chicago.
Delegated agencies are authorized to conduct many of the duties within their political boundaries that would
otherwise be performed by an IEPA field office including: investigating violations of land pollution laws
and reports of open dumping; and inspection of permitted landfills, transfer stations and compost facilities.
These are sites that the Department inspects already.

PROPOSED SALE OR PURCHASE OF REAL ESTATE
Department(s): Department of Real Estate Management
Other Part(ies): City of Des Plaines, Des Plaines, Illinois
Request: Approval of an Intergovernmental Agreement for sale of County excess land to the City of
Des Plaines
Description of Real Estate: Subject property consists of approximately 922 square feet or + 0.002 acre
in Cook County District #17, located south of I-90 and west of the Canadian National Railroad right of
way
Section: W ½ SW ¼ Section: 33-41-12
Parcel(s): DOTH Excess Land EL #444
Fiscal Impact: Revenue Generating
Accounts: (MFT) Motor Fuel Tax Account
Summary: The City of Des Plaines has notified the Real Estate Director that it desires to acquire the
subject property from the County and an adjacent parcel from the Illinois Toll Authority in order to
provide a parcel of land owned by the Rosemont Park District easement access through a private
development to the Mannheim and Higgins Road rights of way.
Pursuant to Cook County Code Chapter 66, Section 66-2 (the “Surplus Property Ordinance”), the Cook
County Department of Transportation and Highways has determined that this property is “surplus.” The
Department of Real Estate Management has determined that the subject property is not needed for other
County purposes, and is not commercially marketable. This determination is based upon the very small
size of the parcel, the lack of street access, and the adjacency of the parcel to the railroad right of way.
Based on an appraisal obtained by the Illinois Toll Authority for the adjacent parcel, the City of Des
Plaines has agreed to pay the County $5,071.00 for the subject parcel. This price is within the range of
fair market value.

Account 528-630 was identified as the source of transfer of funds for Professional and Managerial
Services. The actual cost of a scanning software came lower than the budgeted amount, hence
$36,000.00 became available for transfer into Account 528-260 for Professional and Managerial
Services.
Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from.
None
If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
The actual cost of a scanning software came lower than the budgeted amount, hence $36,000.00 became
available for transfer into Account 528-260 for Professional and Managerial Services.

certified copy of a County Ordinance or Resolution validating such a finding that the property is deemed
"abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b need not be filed at the time of filing the Class 6b eligibility
application with the Assessor, but must be filed with the Assessor no later than the date an assessment
appeal is filed to request the class change to Class 6b. If the Resolution is not filed at the time of the Class
6b eligibility application, the applicant shall instead file, at that time, a letter from the municipality or the
County as the case may be, confirming that a Resolution or Ordinance regarding special circumstances has
been requested.
If the real estate is located within an Industrial Growth Zone, prior to filing a Class 6b eligibility
application with the Assessor and in lieu of an Ordinance or Resolution, an applicant must obtain from an

Temporary Emergency Economic Recovery Modification (TEERM) Program: In the instance
where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as defined herein, the municipality or

the property is deemed "abandoned" for purpose of a Class 6b under the TEERM Program if there has been
no purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have been vacant and unused for at least 12
continuous months. The finding of abandonment, along with the specification of the special circumstances,
shall be included in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and consenting to the Class 6b application

circumstances has been requested.
Sustainable Emergency Relief (SER) Program: In the instance where real estate does not meet the
definition of abandoned property as defined herein, the municipality or the County Board, as the case may
be, may still determine that special circumstances justify finding that the property is deemed "qualified" for
purpose of Class 6b under the SER Program if:
1.

The industrial enterprise that occupies the premises has been at the same location
for a minimum of ten years prior to the date of application for the SER Program;
and

2.

The industrial enterprise that occupies the premises submits evidence of hardship
supporting a determination that participation in the SER Program is necessary for
the industrial enterprise to continue operations at its current location and maintain
its staff, and that without such designation the industrial enterprise would not be
economically viable causing the property to be in imminent risk of becoming
vacant and unused.

The finding that a property is qualified, along with the specification of the special circumstances,
and a determination that the applicant's participation in the SER Program is necessary for the industrial
enterprise to continue operations at its current location and maintain its staff, and that without such
designation the industrial enterprise would not be economically viable causing the property to be in
imminent risk of becoming vacant and unused, shall be included in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting
and consenting to the Class 6b application. If the Ordinance or Resolution is that of a municipality, the
approval of the County Board is required to validate such a finding that the property is deemed "qualified"
for purposes of Class 6b, and a County Resolution to that effect shall be obtained. The applicant must obtain
the municipal enabling Ordinance with the required finding of special circumstances and present such
municipal Ordinance to the Board of Commissioners of Cook County prior to its determination as to
whether it will validate such a finding that the property is deemed "qualified" for purposes of Class 6b and
provide a County Resolution to that effect. A certified copy of an Ordinance or Resolution finding that
special circumstances exist, as well as a certified copy of a County Ordinance or Resolution validating such
a finding that the property is deemed "qualified" for purposes of Class 6b need not be filed at the time of
filing the Class 6b application with the Assessor, but must be filed with the Assessor no later than the date
an assessment appeal is filed to request the class change to Class 6b. If the Resolution is not filed at the
time of the Class 6b application, the applicant shall instead file, at that time, a letter from the municipality
or the County as the case may be, confirming that a Resolution or Ordinance regarding special
circumstances has been requested.

location, then the Class 6b incentive granted pursuant to the SER program shall terminate.
e.This classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the date such new

completed and initially assessed, or in the case of abandoned property, from the date of
substantial re-occupancy, or in the case of incentives granted pursuant to the TEERM
Program, from the date of the notice of approval. In the case of incentives granted pursuant
to the SER Program, this classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the date
of the notice of approval, or until the industrial enterprise that occupied the premises at the
time of the SER application ceases operations at that location if that occurs sooner.
f.Unless a Class 6b granted pursuant to the TEERM Program or the SER Program, this
incentive may be renewed during the last year a property is entitled to a ten percent
assessment level pursuant to Section 74-64(7), if the following requirements are met:
1.

The taxpayer notifies the Assessor's Office of intent to request renewal of the
incentive from the municipality or the County Board if the real estate is located in
an unincorporated area;

2.

The municipality in which the real estate is located or the County Board, if the real
estate is located in an unincorporated area, adopts a Resolution expressly stating
that the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, has determined that
the industrial use of the property is necessary and beneficial to the local economy,
and supports and consents to renewal of the Class 6b; provided, however, that if
the real estate is located within an Industrial Growth Zone, in lieu of a Resolution,
may provide from an authorized officer of the municipality or an authorized officer
of the Cook County Bureau of Economic Development if the real estate is located
in an unincorporated area, a certified letter stating that the municipality or the

property is situated; or vacant land; where such real estate because of contamination has
undergone environmental testing and remediation and has received a "No Further
Remediation Letter" from the site remediation program.
a.To be eligible for a Class C classification an applicant must have received a "No Further
Remediation Letter" confirming achievement of the remediation objectives based on the
industrial or commercial use.
b.The owner of the property is rendered ineligible for the Class C classification by having
previously owned or operated the site, directly or indirectly, or having been a partner or
being associated through a family or business relationship with anyone who has owned or
operated the site, which ownership or operation caused the contamination which was
remediated pursuant to a site remediation, except for an employee who worked for an
owner, as defined herein, that operated the site. A present owner or employer who can
successfully demonstrate that the owner or employer was not responsible for the
contamination may be eligible for Class C classification.

c.An applicant must obtain from the municipality in which the real estate is located or the
County Board if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, an Ordinance or
Resolution expressly stating that the municipality or County Board, as the case may be, has
determined that the incentive provided by Class C is necessary for development to occur
on that specific real estate and that the municipality or County Board, as the case may be,
supports and consents to the Class C application to the Assessor. A certified copy of the
Ordinance or Resolution must be filed at the time of application for the Class C
classification. A copy of that Ordinance or Resolution, whichever is submitted, will be
forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the Board for distribution to the
members of the County Board from the affected districts.
d.To qualify for the Class C classification, an application for Class C classification must
be made within one year of the receipt of the "No Further Remediation Letter". Where an
application for Class C classification encompasses less than all of the contiguous property
owned by the applicant upon which remediation has been completed, the one-year
limitation will be waived for any subsequent separate application for Class C classification
for the remainder or for additional portions of the property, provided that such subsequent
application is made within seven years.
e.Additionally, to qualify for the Class C classification, the estimated remediation costs,
including site investigation, testing, oversight, remediation and removal costs, monitoring,
and engineering and legal fees associated with the remediation process, must total at least
$100,000.00, or alternatively, must total at least 25 percent of the market value of the real
estate as determined by the Assessor's property record card in the year prior to the
remediation, whichever is less.
f.The initial Class C classification shall continue for a period of 12 years for both industrial
and commercial property. For industrial property, this incentive may be renewed during
the last year a property is entitled to a 16-percent assessment level, if the following
requirements are met:
1.

The taxpayer notifies the Assessor's Office of the taxpayer's intent to request
renewal of the incentive from the municipality, or the County Board if the real
estate is located in an unincorporated area;

2.

The municipality in which the real estate is located or the County Board, if the real
estate is located in an unincorporated area, adopts a Resolution expressly stating
that the municipality or County Board, as the case may be, has determined that the
industrial use of the property is necessary and beneficial to the local economy, and
supports and consents to renewal of the Class C; and

3.

A copy of that Resolution and a completed renewal application are filed with the
Office of the Assessor before the expiration of the 16-percent assessment level
period.

The number of renewal periods is not limited as long as the property continues to apply and qualify
for Class C. Any property which applies for Class C treatment on or before the adoption date of the
ordinance from which this division is derived will be eligible for this renewal term at the end of their original
incentive period subject to the above requirements. The notice of intent to request renewal which is filed
with the Assessor's Office will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the Board for
distribution to members of the County Board from the effected districts.
g.If, on November 23, 1999, a property is receiving Class C treatment, but the assessment
level is higher than 16 percent, that taxpayer may apply for renewal as outlined above and
receive a 16-percent assessment level for the prescribed period beginning after the filing
and approval of the resolution and renewal application. However, if, as of that effective
date, the taxpayer's assessment is higher than 16 percent and the taxpayer is granted a
renewal of the incentive for subsequent years, no reduction of the current assessment level
based on renewal of the incentive will be granted. If no renewal is obtained, the incentive
shall be phased out over the next two years, pursuant to Section 74-64. After such ten-year
period expiration of the last incentive period, the real estate shall revert to the applicable
classification under this Division.
h.For commercial properties, once the original 12-year incentive period has expired, the
commercial Class C incentive will expire. The incentive classification will not be subject
to renewal and the real estate shall revert to the applicable classification under this
Division.
i.The Assessor shall review the application and supporting documentation to determine
eligibility for the Class C classification. The Assessor may adopt rules consistent with the
foregoing necessary to ensure proper review of all factors relevant to determine initial and
continued eligibility for the benefits provided under the Class C classification.
j.The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports by all
Class C recipients as to the use of the property and the number of persons employed at the
Class C site. Such reports shall be verified. Failure to file such reports within the time
established by the Assessor's rules shall result in loss of the incentive for the period relating
to the non-filing.

commercial development project, as determined pursuant to Section 74-65(a), located in
an area in need of commercial development, where total development costs, exclusive of
land, do not exceed $2,000,000.00, consisting of all newly constructed buildings or other
structures, including the land upon which they are situated; or abandoned property, as
defined in this Division, including the land upon which such property is situated; or all
buildings and other structures which are substantially rehabilitated to the extent such
rehabilitation has added to their value, including qualified land related to the rehabilitation.

improvements. The amount of land eligible for the incentive shall be in such proportion as
the square footage added by the rehabilitation bears to the total square footage of the
improvements on the parcel.

a.In the instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as
defined herein, the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may still
determine that special circumstances justify that the property is deemed "abandoned" for
purposes of Class 7a. The finding of abandonment, along with the specification of the
special circumstances, shall be included in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and
consenting to the Class 7a application. Notwithstanding the foregoing, special
circumstances may not be determined to justify finding that a property is deemed
"abandoned" where:
A.There has been a purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have
not been vacant and unused prior to such purchase; or
B.There has been no purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have
been vacant and unused for less than 24 continuous months.
Such Resolution or Ordinance must be filed with the eligibility application. If the Ordinance or
Resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the County Board is required to validate such a finding
that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 7a and a Resolution to that effect shall be
included with the Class 7a eligibility application filed with the Assessor.
b.This classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the date such new
construction (excluding demolition, if any) or such substantial rehabilitation was
completed and initially assessed, or in the case of abandoned property, from the date of
substantial re-occupancy. After such 12-year period, the real estate shall revert to the
applicable classification under this Division.
c.The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports by all
Class 7a recipients as to the use of the property and the number of persons employed at the
Class 7a site. Such reports shall be verified. Failure to file such reports within the time
established by the Assessor's rules shall result in loss of the incentive for the period relating
to the non-filing.

Class 7b. Real estate used primarily for commercial purposes, as defined in this Division,
comprising a qualified commercial development project, as determined pursuant to Section
74-65(a), located in an "area in need of commercial development", where total
development costs, exclusive of land, exceed $2,000,000.00, consisting of all newly
constructed buildings or other structures, including the land upon which they are situated;
or abandoned property, as defined herein, including the land upon which such property is
situated; or all buildings and other structures which are substantially rehabilitated to the
extent such rehabilitation has added to their value, including qualified land related to the
rehabilitation. Land qualifies when the rehabilitation adds vertical or horizontal square
footage to the improvements. The amount of land eligible for the incentive shall be in such
proportion as the square footage added by the rehabilitation bears to the total square footage
of the improvements on the parcel.

a.In the instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as
defined herein, the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may still
determine that special circumstances justify finding that the property is deemed
"abandoned" for purposes of Class 7b. The finding of abandonment, along with the
specification of the special circumstances, shall be included in the Resolution or Ordinance
supporting and consenting to the Class 7b application. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
special circumstances may not be determined to justify finding that a property is deemed
"abandoned" where:
A.There has been a purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have
not been vacant and unused prior to such purchase; or
B.There has been no purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have
been vacant and unused for less than 24 continuous months.
Such Resolution or Ordinance must be filed with the eligibility application. If the ordinance or
resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the County Board is required to validate such a finding
that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 7b and a resolution to that effect shall be
included with the Class 7b eligibility application filed with the Assessor.
b.This classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the date such new
construction (excluding demolition, if any) or such substantial rehabilitation was
completed and initially assessed, or in the case of abandoned property, from the date of
substantial re-occupancy.
c.The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports by all
Class 7b recipients as to the use of the property and the number of persons employed at the
Class 7b site. Such reports shall be verified. Failure to file such reports within the time
established by the Assessor's rules shall result in loss of the incentive for the period relating
to the non-filing.

commercial purposes, consisting of all newly constructed buildings or other structures,
including the land upon which they are situated; or abandoned property, including the land
upon which such property is situated; or all buildings and other structures which are
substantially rehabilitated to the extent such rehabilitation has added to their value,
including qualified land related to the rehabilitation. Land qualifies when the rehabilitation
adds vertical or horizontal square footage to the improvements. The amount of land eligible
for the incentive shall be in such proportion as the square footage added by the
rehabilitation bears to the total square footage of the improvements on the parcel.
a.An applicant must obtain from the municipality in which the real estate is located or the
County Board if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, an Ordinance or
Resolution expressly stating that:

(i)The property, site, or area is deemed a redevelopment priority by the
municipality, and
(ii)The municipality or County Board, as the case may be, has determined that the
incentive provided by Class 7c is necessary for development to occur on that
specific real estate and that the municipality or County Board, as the case may be,
supports and consents to the Class 7c application to the Assessor.
In order to determine Class 7c applications, an application for Class 7c shall be submitted to the
Assessor and the Bureau of Economic Development. Upon receipt of the application and all the necessary
supporting data, the Economic Development Advisory Committee of the County, within 30 days return the
application to the Assessor with a finding stating whether the conditions of Subsections (a)(1)-(a)(4) of this
Section are present. The Assessor shall review the application, supporting data, findings of the Committee
and other appropriate facts. Where the Assessor finds the conditions of Subsections (a)(1)-(a)(4) of this
Section exist, the Assessor shall, within 30 days of the receipt of the Committee's findings, certify the
commercial development project eligible for Class 7c treatment under this Division.
Where the Economic Development Advisory Committee does not return a finding stating whether
the conditions of Subsections (a)(1)-(a)(4) of this Section are present within 30 days, and upon further
application of the requesting party, the Assessor may review the application, supporting data, and other
appropriate facts and certify the commercial development project eligible for Class 7c treatment and grant
the incentive.
(1)

That the Property's (the real estate that is subject of the Incentive application) Assessed
Value, Equalized Assessed Value or Real estate taxes for three of the last six years, have
declined or remained stagnant due to the depressed condition;

(2)

There is a reasonable expectation that the development, re-development or rehabilitation
of the commercial development project is viable and likely to go forward on a reasonably
timely basis if granted Class 7c designation and will therefore result in the economic
enhancement of the property;

(3)

Certification of the commercial development project for Class 7c designation will
materially assist development, redevelopment or rehabilitation of the property and the
commercial development property would not go forward without the full incentive offered
under Class 7c; and

(4)

Certification of the commercial development project for Class 7c designation is reasonably
expected to ultimately result in an increase in real property tax revenue and employment
opportunities of the property.
b.A certified copy of the Ordinance or Resolution need not be filed at the time of filing the
Class 7c eligibility application with the Assessor, but must be filed with the Assessor no
later than the date an assessment appeal is filed to request the class change to Class 7c. If
the Resolution is not filed at the time of the eligibility application, the applicant may instead

file, at that time, a letter from the municipality or the County, as the case may be,
confirming that a Resolution or Ordinance supporting the incentive has been requested.
c.A copy of the Resolution or letter confirming that a Resolution has been requested,
whichever is filed with the application, will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the
Secretary of the County Board for distribution to the members of the County Board from
the affected districts.
d.Class 7c applications for newly constructed or substantially rehabilitated buildings and
other structures must be made to the Assessor within one year prior to the commencement
of such new construction or substantial rehabilitation to qualify for a Class 7c incentive.
With respect to abandoned property, the Class 7c application must be made to the Assessor
prior to the commencement of the reoccupation of the vacant and unused property. For the
purpose of this Incentive [Class 7c] "abandoned property" shall mean property where the
buildings and other structures, or portions thereof, have been vacant and unused for more
than 12 continuous months and as established by rule of the Assessor.
e.This classification shall continue for a period of three years from the date such new
construction (excluding demolition, if any) such substantial rehabilitation was completed
and initially assessed, or in the case of abandoned property, from the date of substantial
occupancy.
f.Class 7c incentives that are granted are renewable.
The incentive shall be phase out after five years, pursuant to Section 74-64(8). After
expiration of the last incentive period, the real estate shall revert to the applicable
classification under this Division.
g.The Assessor may adopt rules consistent with this subsection necessary to ensure proper
review of all factors relevant to determine eligibility and continued eligibility for the
benefits provided under Class 7c.
h.Class 7c Applications must be received by the Assessor's Office on or before November
30, 2019, to receive consideration.
i.Renewal. The Class 7c Incentive shall be limited to only one renewal. The applicant may
apply for a renewal on or after the third year of the Incentive, but before the expiration of
the fifth year of the Incentive. The applicant must obtain the municipal enabling Ordinance
and present such municipal Ordinance to the Board of Commissioners of Cook County as
to whether it will validate the renewal. The Incentive may be renewed unless otherwise
limited herein.

for the Incentive is filed. In addition, the Class 7c Incentive may be applied for only one
year prior to the tax year in which the Incentive was applied via a certificate of error.

all newly constructed buildings or other structures, including the land upon which they are
situated; or abandoned property, as defined in this division, including the land upon which
such property is situated; or all buildings and other structures which are substantially
rehabilitated to the extent such rehabilitation has added to their value, including qualified
land related to the rehabilitation.
a.Land qualifies when the rehabilitation adds vertical or horizontal square footage to the
improvements. The amount of land eligible for the incentive shall be in such proportion as
the square footage added by the rehabilitation bears to the total square footage of the
improvements on the parcel. Such real estate must be either obtained through the Cook
County Tax Reactivation Project or must be located in one of the following designated
geographical areas:

by lawful Resolution determine that such real estate is consistent with an overall
plan for the rehabilitation of the area; or
3.Any one of the following five townships: Bloom, Bremen, Calumet, Rich and
Thornton.

b.

In the instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as
defined herein, the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may still determine

Class 8, unless:
1.

There has been a purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have
not been vacant and unused prior to such purchase; or

2.

There has been no purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have
been vacant and unused for less than 24 continuous months.
The finding of abandonment, along with the specification of the special circumstances, shall be
included in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and consenting to the Class 8 application. If the
Ordinance or Resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the County Board is required to validate
such, a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 8, and a Resolution to that
effect shall be obtained. The applicant must obtain the municipal enabling Ordinance with the required
finding of special circumstances and present such municipal Ordinance to the Board of Commissioners of
Cook County prior to its determination as to whether it will validate such a finding that the property is
deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 8 and provide a County Resolution to that effect. A certified

change to Class 8. If the Resolution is not filed at the time of the Class 8 application, the applicant shall
instead file, at that time, a letter from the municipality or the County as the case may be, confirming that a
Resolution or Ordinance regarding special circumstances has been requested.

property is deemed "abandoned" for purpose of Class 8 under the TEERM Program, if there has been no
purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have been vacant and unused for at least 12
continuous months. The finding of abandonment, along with the specification of the special circumstances,
shall be included in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and consenting to the Class 8 application. If
the Ordinance or Resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the County Board is required to
validate such, a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 8, and a Resolution
to that effect shall be obtained. The applicant must obtain the municipal enabling Ordinance with the
required finding of special circumstances and present such municipal Ordinance to the Board of
Commissioners of Cook County prior to its determination as to whether it will validate such a finding that
the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 8 and provide a County Resolution to that effect.

Class S. Real estate otherwise entitled to Class 3 classification under this division,
consisting of land and existing buildings and structures, which is has been subject to a
Section 8 contract renewal. The portion of the land and building eligible for the incentive
shall be in such proportion as the number of Section 8 units bears to the total number of
units. The proportion shall be applied only to property used for residential purposes, and
not to portions of the property, if any, used for commercial purposes.
a.Property qualifies for the Class S classification if its Section 8 contract has been renewed
pursuant to one of the following alternatives:
1.

HUD has approved renewal of the Section 8 contract under the mark up to market
option, after finding that:
i.The property has received a physical inspection score of at least 60, in an
inspection by HUD's Real Estate Assessment Center, confirming that the property
is decent, safe, sanitary and in good repair with no uncorrected exigent health and
safety (EHS) violations;
ii.The property does not have a low- and moderate-income use restriction that
cannot be eliminated by unilateral action by the owner. If, however, the current
rent is lower than the use restriction, HUD may use the mark up to market option
to increase the rents to the use restriction level, which would be a renewal
qualifying for the S classification; and
Page 192 of 206

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

August 3, 2016

iii.A rent comparability study conducted by HUD has demonstrated that
comparable market rents are above 100 percent of the HUD Fair Market Rent.
2.

HUD has approved a contract renewal for five years of the Section 8 contract under
the mark up to market under HUD's discretionary authority, after finding that the
property meets at least one of the required criteria:
i.A vulnerable population is affected,
ii.There is a low vacancy rate in the area, which would make tenant based
assistance difficult to use, or a lack of comparable housing, or
iii.The project is a high priority for the local community, as demonstrated by a
contribution of state or local funds to the property.

3.

HUD has approved renewal of a Section 8 contract for a not for profit corporation
under any available option under HUD's renewal procedures as described in HUD's
Section 8 Renewal Policy Guidelines.

b.Additional requirements for qualification for the S classification are:
1.

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

1.

Has determined that the incentive provided by Class L is necessary for the
substantial rehabilitation of the property;

2.

Supports and consents to the granting of the incentive; and

3.

Has reviewed and accepted its preservation commission's written
recommendation of the project for the Class L incentive. This
recommendation will specify the project's budget and proposed scope of
work and will specify that the project will meets or exceeds the Standards
of the United States Department of the Interior for Rehabilitation,
Preservation, Restoration, and Reconstruction of historic properties.

c.A certified copy of the Ordinance or Resolution need not be filed with the Assessor at
the time the Class L eligibility application is filed but the Ordinance or Resolution must be
filed with the Assessor no later than the date an assessment appeal is filed to request the
class change to Class L.
d.If the Ordinance or Resolution is not filed at the time of the eligibility application is filed,
the applicant shall instead, include the following items with the eligibility application:
1.

A letter from the municipality or the County, as the case may be,
confirming that a Resolution or Ordinance supporting the incentive has
been requested; and

e.A copy of the Resolution or letter confirming that a Resolution has been requested,
whichever is filed with the application, will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the

affected districts.
f.Additionally, to qualify a landmark building or contributing building for Class L
classification, an eligibility application must be made to the Assessor within one year prior
to the commencement of substantial rehabilitation. After the substantial rehabilitation has
been completed, the preservation commission shall review the project to determine that it
is eligible under Subsection (14) of this Section. The applicant must supplement the
eligibility application with a copy of the determination of the preservation commission
prior to classification of the real estate as Class L.
g.The initial Class L classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the date
such substantial rehabilitation was completed and initially assessed.
h.For property which was initially classified as Class 3, 4 or 5b, this incentive may be
renewed during the last year a property is entitled to a 16-percent assessment level, if the
following requirements are met:

Page 195 of 206

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

August 3, 2016

1.

The taxpayer notifies the Assessor's Office of the taxpayer's intent to
request renewal of the incentive from the municipality, or the County
Board if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area;

2.

The municipality in which the real estate is located or the County Board,
if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, adopts a resolution
expressly stating that the municipality or County Board, as the case may
be, has determined that the industrial use of the property is necessary and
beneficial to the local economy, and supports and consents to renewal of
the Class L; and

3.

A copy of that Resolution and a completed renewal application are filed
with the Office of the Assessor before the expiration of the incentive
period.

The number of renewal periods is not limited as long as the property continues to apply and qualify
for Class L. The notice of intent to request renewal which is filed with the Assessor's Office will be
forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the County Board for distribution to members of the
County Board from the affected districts.
i.If, as of November 23, 1999, a property is receiving Class L treatment, but the assessment
level is higher than 16 percent, that taxpayer may apply for renewal as outlined above and
receive a 16-percent assessment level for the prescribed period beginning after the filing
and approval of the Resolution and renewal application. However, if as of the effective
date, the taxpayer's assessment is higher than 16 percent and the taxpayer is granted a
renewal of the incentive for subsequent years, no reduction of the current assessment level
based on renewal of the incentive will be granted. If no renewal is obtained, the incentive
shall be phased out over the next two years, pursuant to Section 74-64. After expiration of
the last incentive period, the real estate shall revert to the applicable classification under
this Division.
j.For commercial properties, once the original 12-year incentive period has expired, the
commercial Class L incentive will expire. The incentive classification will not be subject
to renewal and the real estate shall revert to the applicable classification under this
Division.
k.The Assessor shall adopt rules consistent with the foregoing necessary to ensure proper
review of all factors relevant to determine initial and continued eligibility for the benefits
provided under Class L.
l.The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports by all
Class L recipients as to the continued landmark status of the property and the number of
persons employed at the Class L site. Failure to file such reports within the time established
by the Assessor's rules may result in loss of the incentive for the period relating to the nonfiling.
