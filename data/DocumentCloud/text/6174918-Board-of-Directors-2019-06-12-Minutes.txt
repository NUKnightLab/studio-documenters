PROJECTS
Uniroyal Site: Extension Request
Ms. Pavelko presented the Uniroyal Site: Extension Request to the DBRA Board.
As the Board is aware, the Detroit Brownfield Redevelopment Authority (“DBRA”) has engaged Skidmore,
Owings and Merrill (“SOM”) to create a Master Plan for the 42-acre Uniroyal site (the “Site”) in order to
better inform a phasing of the acquisition and development of the Site under the 2005 Development
Agreement between the DBRA and Bettis/Betters Development, LLC (the “Development Agreement”). The
current deadline for closing on the entire Site is August 1, 2019.
In light of the parties’ intention of agreeing to a phasing strategy for the Site, as informed by the Master
Plan (currently estimated for completion by July 31, 2019), Staff recommends an extension as follows:
•

•
•

DBRA Board to approve revised proposed minimum development requirements, development
phasing, and milestones by September 25, 2019 (collectively, the “Revised Development
Requirements”), which Revised Development Requirements will include a new proposed closing
date of no earlier than December 13, 2019
In the event DBRA Board does not approve the Revised Development Requirements by September
25, 2019, closing under the current Development Agreement terms will be extend to December 13,
2019.
In the event of delays caused by SOM and/or DBRA staff, staff may grant extensions to the above
dates of no more than 30 days each without further Board approval.

A resolution was attached for the Board’s consideration.
Ms. DeSantis asked how the public will be engaged in the planning process and the environmental
implications. Ms. Pavelko stated that the priorities previously laid out by the community will be included in
the master plan and that the community was engaged during the process for creating the East Riverfront

 Framework Plan. The Master Plan will be presented at a community meeting facilitated by the Department
of Neighborhoods and community input will be received. There will be some discussion on the
environmental work but more information on the environmental remediation will be provided later as the
information is received.
Ms. DeSantis asked if there will only be one community meeting after the master plan is created and if the
notification for the meeting will be distributed city-wide or only within a certain distance from the project site.
Ms. Pavelko stated that the Department of Neighborhoods is working through where the notification area
will be and working with community groups to provide notifications.
Ms. DeSantis stated that because of the iconic nature of the Uniroyal site, every resident in Detroit should
be notified about the community meeting in order to receive their input. Ms. Pavelko stated that there will
likely be future community meetings as part of the Community Benefits Ordinance.
Ms. DeSantis stated that she would like to hear feedback from the community through well organized citywide meetings over a longer period of time.
Mr. Walters called for a motion approving the Uniroyal Site: Extension Request, as presented. The Board
took the following action:
On a motion by Ms. DeSantis, seconded by Ms. McClain, DBRA Resolution Code 19-06-130-18
was approved. Ms. Mays and Mr. Scott opposed.

The Targeted Redevelopment Area (TRA) includes 276 adjacent parcels, including the Mack Engine Plant,
which will undergo significant redevelopment activities to prepare for and support the Mack Engine Plant

American Axle Manufacturing, Inc. Brownfield Redevelopment Plan: Recommend Termination
Mr. Vosburg presented the recommendation to terminate the American Axle Manufacturing, Inc. Brownfield
Plan to the DBRA Board.
Section 14(8)(a) of Act 381 of 1996, as amended, states:
“A brownfield plan or plan amendment may be abolished or terminated according to this subsection
subject to all of the following:
(a) The governing body may abolish a brownfield plan when it finds that the purposes for which
the plan was established are accomplished.
(b) The governing body may terminate a brownfield plan or plan amendment for an eligible
property if the project for which eligible activities were identified in the brownfield plan or
plan amendment fails to occur with respect to the eligible property for at least 2 years
following the date of the resolution approving the brownfield plan or plan amendment,
provided that the governing body first does both of the following:
(i)
(ii)

Gives 30 days' prior written notice to the developer at its last known address by
certified mail or other method that documents proof of delivery attempted.
Provides the developer an opportunity to be heard at a public meeting.”

Over the years, the DBRA has approved Brownfield Plans which describe projects that have been
completed or have failed to come to fruition (the “Plan(s)”). These Plans, particularly Plans that involve TIF
revenue, create an administrative burden for the City and the DBRA with multiple annual accounting and
reporting requirements for each Plan. Additionally, a stalled Plan prevents a new proposed development
from being able to use and/or take full advantage of Brownfield TIF. Terminating or abolishing a Plan allows

 new proposed developments to make full use of Brownfield TIF financing through a new Brownfield Plan
that is in line with the new proposed development.
American Axle & Manufacturing, Inc. is a Plan approved by Council on April 25, 2001. The project,
developed by American Axle Manufacturing, Inc., proposed the redevelopment of one parcel located in
Detroit near Holbrook and the Northbound I-75 Service Drive. The project has been completed and the
purposes for which the Plan was established have been accomplished. Section 14(8)(b) of Act 381 of 1996,
as amended, allows City Council to abolish the plan as a result.
It is the opinion of DBRA staff that the American Axle & Manufacturing, Inc. Plan should be abolished due
to the fact that the project described in the Plan has been completed and the purposes for which the Plan
was established have been accomplished. DBRA staff, upon DBRA Board approval, will send a notice via
certified mail to the developer no less than 30 days before the date City Council is scheduled to abolish the
Plan.
A resolution recommending the following actions for the Plan was attached for Board review and approval:
1. Recommendation to abolish the Plan to City Council.
2. Issue a certified letter notification to the Developer of the intent to abolish the Plan in no less than
30 days as well as the opportunity to be heard at a public meeting.
3. Authorization to the DBRA to terminate any other agreements or contracts between Developer and
the DBRA executed in conjunction with the Plan upon abolishment of the Plan by City Council.
The Plan will be formally abolished upon adoption of a Resolution for the Plan by City Council and following
the signing of the Resolution by the Mayor.
Ms. DeSantis called for a motion recommending termination of the American Axle Manufacturing, Inc.
Brownfield Redevelopment Plan. The Board took the following action:

Pine Street Townhome Redevelopment Plan: Recommend Termination
Mr. Vosburg presented the recommendation to terminate the Pine Street Townhome Brownfield Plan to the
DBRA Board.
Section 14(8)(b) of Act 381 of 1996, as amended, states:
“A brownfield plan or plan amendment may be abolished or terminated according to this subsection
subject to all of the following:
(b) The governing body may terminate a brownfield plan or plan amendment for an eligible property
if the project for which eligible activities were identified in the brownfield plan or plan amendment
fails to occur with respect to the eligible property for at least 2 years following the date of the

 resolution approving the brownfield plan or plan amendment, provided that the governing body first
does both of the following:
(v)
Gives 30 days' prior written notice to the developer at its last known address by
certified mail or other method that documents proof of delivery attempted.
(vi)
Provides the developer an opportunity to be heard at a public meeting.”
Over the years, the DBRA has approved Brownfield Plans which describe projects that have failed to come
to fruition (the “Plan(s)”). These Plans, particularly Plans that involve TIF revenue, create an administrative
burden for the City and the DBRA with multiple annual accounting and reporting requirements for each
Plan. Additionally, a stalled Plan prevents a new proposed development from being able to use and/or take
full advantage of Brownfield TIF. Terminating a Plan allows new proposed developments to make full use
of Brownfield TIF financing through a new Brownfield Plan that is in line with the new proposed
development.
Pine Street Townhome is a Plan approved by Council on July 15, 2008. The project, developed by
Corktown Housing, LLC, proposed the redevelopment of one parcel located in Detroit’s North Corktown
Area. The project failed to occur within two (2) years of City Council approval of the Plan. Section 14(8)(b)
of Act 381 of 1996, as amended, allows City Council to terminate the plan as a result.
It is the opinion of DBRA staff that the Pine Street Townhome Plan should be terminated due to the fact
that the project described in the Plan has failed to occur, and more than 2 years has passed since City
Council approval of the Plan. DBRA staff, upon DBRA Board approval, will send a notice via certified mail
to the developer no less than 30 days before the date City Council is scheduled to terminate the Plan.
A resolution recommending the following actions for the Plan was attached for Board review and approval:
1. Recommendation to terminate the Plan to City Council.
2. Issue a certified letter notification to the Developer of the intent to terminate the Plan in no less than
30 days as well as the opportunity to be heard at a public meeting.
3. Authorization to the DBRA to terminate any other agreements or contracts between Developer and
the DBRA executed in conjunction with the Plan upon termination of the Plan by City Council.
The Plan will be formally terminated upon adoption of a Resolution for the Plan by City Council and following
the signing of the Resolution by the Mayor.
Ms. DeSantis asked where the location was for the Plan. Mr. Vosburg stated that the location for the Plan
was in North Corktown.
Ms. DeSantis called for a motion recommending termination of the Pine Street Townhome Brownfield
Redevelopment Plan. The Board took the following action:
On a motion by Ms. McClain, seconded by Mr. Gonzalez, DBRA Resolution Code 19-06-155-03
was unanimously approved.
Industrial Land Assembly Project: Authorization to Enter into Contract with Angelo Iafrate
Construction Company
Mr. Robertson presented the Industrial Land Assembly Project: Authorization to Enter into Contract with
Angelo Iafrate Construction Company to the DBRA Board.
As the Board is aware, the City of Detroit administration has requested the assistance of the City of Detroit
Brownfield Redevelopment Authority (“DBRA”) in industrial land assembly activities aimed at establishing

 market-ready industrial sites within City limits in order to attract manufacturing and logistics companies (the
“Land Assembly Project”). On October 24, 2018 (DBRA 18-10-262-01) and November 7, 2018 (DBRA 1810-262-02) the Board approved certain initial steps in connection with the Land Assembly Project, including
the allocation and acceptance of a total of $10 Million in initial funds for the Land Assembly Project.

From these bids, DBRA staff selected Angelo Iafrate Construction Company (the “Contractor”) as the
lowest, most responsive bidder.
The Contractor will be performing the following scope: Site 4 - permits, soil erosion controls, grubbing,
debris removal, underground storage tank removal and closure, concrete removal, removal of above grade
and below grade soils, and backfill to grade with clean fill. The Contractor has proposed a not-to-exceed
contract amount of One Million Seven Hundred Fifty Six Thousand Nine Hundred Forty Five and 00/100
($1,756,945.00) Dollars for the performance of the services referenced herein.
DBRA staff is requesting the DBRA Board of Directors to authorize the execution of an agreement with the
Contractor to provide the requested services as expressed herein for the not to exceed amount of One
Million Seven Hundred Fifty Six Thousand Nine Hundred Forty Five and 00/100 ($1,756,945.00) Dollars.
Execution of the contract is subject to the DBRA’s receipt of sufficient additional funding from the City for
the Land Assembly Project.
DBRA staff is also recommending that a contingency representing twenty-five (25%) percent of the contract
value, or Four Hundred Thirty Nine Thousand Two Hundred Thirty Six and 50/100 ($439,236.50) Dollars
be established to be dispersed upon the authorization of any two Officers, or any one of the Officers and
any of the Authorized Agents of the DBRA, or any two Authorized Agents of the DBRA.
A resolution approving and authorizing the DBRA to enter into a contract with Angelo Iafrate Construction
Company, for the above described services and the establishment of a contingency fund was attached for
Board consideration.
Mr. George asked how much concrete will be removed. Mr. Robertson stated that there will be
approximately 3 acres of concrete removed.
Ms. Mays asked why the contingency is 25% and if that is a particularly large contingency. Mr. Robertson
stated that typically a 10-15% contingency is requested. Ms. Navin stated that a 25% contingency is being
requested due to the tight timelines for the project.
Ms. DeSantis called for a motion approving the Industrial Land Assembly Project: Authorization to Enter
into Contract with Angelo Iafrate Construction Company, as presented. The Board took the following action:
On a motion by Mr. George, seconded by Ms. McClain, DBRA Resolution Code 19-06-262-03 was

Buildings, Safety Engineering and Environmental Department (BSEED) and it confirms that the Developer
has submitted Phase 1, Phase 2, Baseline Environmental Assessments, and/or Due Care Plans and that
they have been reviewed by BSEED. Mr. Scott stated that the information submitted allows BSEED to
confirm that the property qualifies as a ‘facility’ under Act 381 and also to review the plans for remediation
of environmental issues. Mr. Scott stated that he does not ask questions regarding the environmental parts
of a brownfield plan when it is presented to the DBRA Board because he has already reviewed the
applicable environmental information in his role at BSEED. Mr. Scott also stated that the environmental
parts of a brownfield plan have already been reviewed and vetted and lines up with what is being requested
for reimbursement under the brownfield plan. Mr. Scott stated that if there were anything concerning about
the environmental parts of a brownfield plan that he would certainly bring it to the DBRA Board’s attention
with the brownfield plan is presented.
