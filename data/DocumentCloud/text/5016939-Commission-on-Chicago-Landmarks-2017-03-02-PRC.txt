The following projects were reviewed by the PRC:
1. 1546-1550 N. Clark Street
2nd Ward
Village Theater
Renewal of Expired Approval: Proposed rehabilitation of the front portion of the
Village Theater and demolition of the rear portion to accommodate new construction
of a larger ground floor retail and residential development on the site and the adjacent
property.
Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. As proposed, the historic front facade shall be restored/rehabilitated as
submitted on plans dated February 22, 2017. Final masonry
repair/replacement details, enlarged storefront repair/replacement details,
design of the center entry surround and door details, and window details
shall be reviewed by Historic Preservation staff with the permit
application;
2. As proposed, the non-historic marquee shall be removed and the
uncovered masonry facade repaired/restored as necessary;
3. The proposed 50 foot setback for the new construction taller than the
two-story front portion of the building is approved as submitted on
plans dated February 22, 2017. No visible roof-top additions,
mechanical equipment, decks or appurtenances shall be located on the
two-story portion of the building. The approval of the proposed
demolition and new construction is contingent on the preservation and
restoration of the east façade and north and south exterior walls for a
minimum depth of 20’-0” from the front façade as per submitted plans;
and,
4. A report by a licensed structural engineer addressing how the historic
facade and walls to remain should be supported, braced and protected,
in-situ, during the demolition of the existing roof and interior structure
and the excavation and new construction as well as during the foundation
work, shall be included on the permit plans. The recommended
measures, sequencing, and protections shall be incorporated in the
structural and architectural drawings.

 2. 4601 N. Broadway
46th Ward
Uptown Square District
Proposed demolition of the two 1-story buildings at 4601-11 and 4613-17 N.
Broadway and new construction of a 9-story mixed use building with ground-floor
retail, second-floor parking, and upper floor residential units.
Action:

Approved unanimously with the following preliminary findings and
conditions of approval:
Proposed Demolition:
1. Preliminarily found that the property at 4601-11 N. Broadway, a 1story commercial building constructed c. 1965, is non-contributing to
the character of the Uptown Square District and its demolition will not
be an adverse effect on the character of the Landmark District;
2. Preliminarily found that the property at 4613-17 N. Broadway, a 1story commercial building constructed c.1928 with significant
alterations done in 1974, is non-contributing to the character of the
Uptown Square District and its demolition will not be an adverse
effect on the character of the Landmark District;
3. Recommend that, upon receipt of the two demolition applications, the
Commission recommend to the City Council approval of the proposed
demolition of the buildings at 4601-11 and 4613-17 N. Broadway in
accordance with Section 2-120-825 of the Municipal Code of Chicago,
entitled “Permits for demolition of landmarks – City Council Approval
Required”;
Proposed New Construction:
4. Find that the proposed project, contingent upon City Council approval
of the demolition applications, and with the following conditions, will
not have an adverse effect on the significant historical and
architectural features of the landmark district and approve the project
with the following conditions:
a) Given the existing site location at a prominent corner of the district,
the site size, and the scale of select historic corner buildings in this
district such as the 13-story Broadway Bank building, the proposed
massing at 9-stories tall is approved as proposed;
b) Given this property is at a prominent corner and many of the historic
corner buildings in the district incorporate a clipped corner, a rounded
corner, or an angled corner which deviates from the street wall planes,
the proposed 2’ setback of the stone base along Broadway and Wilson
is approved as proposed;
c) Consistent with historic storefront configurations in the district, a low
storefront knee wall, approximately 1’ to 1’-6” -tall, should be
provided below the storefront windows. Enlarged canopy, window,
grille/louver, and storefront details shall be included in the permit
plans;
d) Typical enlarged façade details, including for the exposed lintels and
brick patterns, shall be provided as part of the permit application;

 e) Exterior wall samples submitted – limestone base; dark ironspot,
white, and grey face bricks; black and white aluminum mullions; and
white crystalized glass for the corner bay, are approved as proposed;
and,
f) Any exterior illumination and signage shall be submitted to the
Commission on Chicago Landmarks for review and approval prior to
order and installation.
3. 631 W. Arlington
43rd Ward
Arlington-Deming District
Proposed construction of a new 2 ½-story masonry residential building with
connections to an existing non-contributing frame building at the rear of the lot
Action:

Approved unanimously with the following preliminary finding and
condition of approval:
1. Preliminarily find that the rear structure, constructed c. 1875-1880 and
significantly altered c.1984, is non-contributing to the character of the
Arlington-Deming District; and,
2. The proposed new construction, connected to the existing rear
building, is approved as submitted on plans dated 9/16/16. Historic
preservation staff shall review and approve brick, mortar and stone
samples with the permit application.

4. 223 W. Menomonee
43rd Ward
Old Town Triangle District
Proposed construction of a new, 1-story, open porch at the front façade and other
alterations
Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. The proposed porch construction is approved as shown on the drawing
dated 1/20/17. Column bases and capitals are to be revised to include
a more substantial profile; and
2. As proposed, at the second floor, the height of the new, second-floor
window is to match those of the other second-floor windows. The
existing surround is to be salvaged and reinstalled with nondecorative
portions of the side casings shortened as needed. The new window is
to match existing double-hung windows. Window details are to be
submitted with the permit application.

5. 328 W. Willow
Old Town Triangle District
Proposed construction of a new front stair and other alterations
Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:

43rd Ward

 1. The proposed replacement of the existing non-historic front stair with
a new stair is approved as shown on drawings dated February 12,
2017. The porch and stair structure should be screened with
decorative lattice and should have a smooth painted finish;
2. The new concrete stair to the lower level entry reconfigured to be
adjacent to the front façade wall so as to be screened by the new stair
structure and reduce visibility is approved as proposed;
3. As proposed, non-historic siding shall be removed from all elevations
of the existing building. Upon removal of the non-historic siding,
Historic Preservation staff shall be notified if any historic wood siding
remains to review its condition and determine if it can be retained and
repaired. Where no historic siding remains, new beveled wood cedar
clapboard siding, as submitted, may be used on the south, west, and
north elevations of the existing building. This siding shall have a
smooth painted finish and maintain a 4” lap exposure to match the
typical lap exposure of historic wood clapboard. As proposed, the east
elevation shall be clad with fiber cement siding to meet code
compliance, and will maintain the same 4” lap exposure and smooth
painted finish. Removal and replacement of siding shall occur in
phases, elevation by elevation, to ensure no more than one building
elevation is exposed to the elements at a time.
4. Proposed fiber-cement replacement siding for all elevations, matching
in profile and texture of the wood siding, is not approved at this time.
Additional information and on-site sample review to be provided for
review and consideration by Historic Preservation staff and
Commissioners Dziekiewicz and Moreno for their decision and report
back to Committee.
6. 1909 N. Humboldt
1st Ward
Logan Square Boulevards District
Proposed construction of a new roof dormer and a new raised deck in the south side
yard
Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. As proposed, all wood is to be painted or stained; and,
2. As proposed the dormer shall be clad with wood clapboard matching
the lap exposure on the front façade.
