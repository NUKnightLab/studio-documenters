CORPORATE MISSION
Ensure that CHA’s housing portfolio is safe, decent and sustainable.
FUNDING
General Fund
GENERAL BACKGROUND /EXPLANATION
The prime design consultants (PDC) provide complete architectural/engineering services in
connection with modernization, rehabilitation, and maintenance of the CHA’s real estate
portfolio. These services include, but are not limited to, evaluating construction feasibility,
scope assessment, overseeing the municipal permitting process, developing construction
documents, providing construction administration support, overseeing the substantial
completion phase, and other related services.
The IDIQ Program funding increase and the contract amendments associated with the above
individual Regional PDC contracts are required to provide funding for potential task order
modifications for architectural/engineering services until current construction projects issued
under existing task orders the PDC contracts have been completed. CCD is requesting to
provide additional contract funding in an amount approximately 1% of the outstanding value of
the current construction contracts for projects underway under the PDC IDIQ Program and the
Individual Regional PDC contracts. This increase in the NTE amount will allow additional
capacity for the PDC contracts to address potential design and/or construction administration
issues related to:
•
Discovered conditions
•
Scope changes
•
Construction time extensions
•
Code compliance
