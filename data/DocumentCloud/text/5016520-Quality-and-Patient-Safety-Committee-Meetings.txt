 Clinical Learning Environment
(C.L.E.R.) Visit 2017
• Emphasis is on the QUALITY and SAFETY of the Environment for
learning and patient care
• Learning Environment has durable effect on long-term practice habits

• Visits are every 18 months (our 3rd visit)
• Two Day Visit
• Must start and end with a meeting that includes the CEO and the DIO
• Interview Residents, PD’s and Faculty using Audience Response System
• Walk rounds include:
• Observations of handoffs
• 1:1 Interviews of Nurses

• Required to maintain accreditation

6
Professional Education 4/20/2018

 CLER Visit - Six Areas of Focus:
• Safety and Reporting
• Residents - no uniform understanding of what to report

• Care Transitions
• Only 31% of residents participated in INTERPROFESSIONAL care transitions

• Health Care Quality
• Only 45% of residents receive aggregated, benchmarked QI data on their patients

• Supervision
• Residents increasingly recognizing situations requiring supervision

• Professionalism
• Cutting and Pasting - Some residents document a piece of history or part of physical that
they did not personally elicit. This is a national Electronic Medical Record (EMR) issue.

• Wellness
• 80% of residents would “power through” fatigue while 70% of Program Directors and
faculty thought they would ask for help

 Brief History of Accreditation
• Since the inception of Medicare via the Social Security Act in
1965, there has been a requirement for participating
organizations to undergo periodic review to assure standards
are met.
• Minimum requirements were developed: the “Conditions of
Participation” (CoPs) and promulgated in 1986
• Meeting those requirements is assured by review by either
state agencies or an approved Accrediting Organization (AO)

2

 What Does Accreditation Mean?
• The system or site has met or exceeded the Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) CoPs
• The Accrediting Organization then recommends to CMS to
allow the facility to participate via deemed status (instead of
a state survey agency certification)

 Accrediting Organization Scope

 Accrediting Organizations for Hospitals
• American Osteopathic Association/Healthcare Facilities
Accreditation Program (4%)
• Center for Improvement on Healthcare Quality (<1%)
• Det Norske Veritas (DNV GL-Healthcare, integrates compliance
with CoPs and ISO 9001 standards, 7%)
• The Joint Commission (88%)

 Hospital Standards Antedated CMS CoPs

1910:

Ernest Codman, MD (Massachusetts General Hospital), proposed that
hospitals develop procedures for tracking patients long enough to
determine whether treatment was effective.

1918:

American College of Surgeons (ACS) developed Codman’s ideas into the
“Minimum Standards for Hospitals,” used in its first inspection of
hospitals.

1951:

ACS joined with the American College of Physicians, the American
Hospital Association, the American Medical Association, and the
Canadian Medical Association (CMA) to create The Joint Commission on
Accreditation of Hospitals (JCAH).

1953:

The JCAH begins voluntary accreditation to hospitals

1988:

JCAHO-name change to reflect spectrum of certification activities

 TJC Changes Over Time
•

Pre-1999
– Scheduled survey, retrospective chart review, croissants

•

Post “To Err is Human” (IOM, 1999)
– Unannounced survey
– 25% documentation review and 75% staff interaction

•

Modern era
– 10% documentation review and 90% staff interaction at the “point of care” or
at each patient care unit.
– Random chart selection for “tracing,” or visiting, the same departments or
services where the patients received treatment
– Periodic performance review (PPR) mid-term

•

2008:
– Mark Chassin, MD named president
– Competition (DNV approved as an AO)

 The Vernacular
Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS)
- Conditions of Participation (CoPs)
- Specific dimensions called Standards

- Deficiencies cited are “tags”
- Participation = Reimbursement

The Joint Commission (TJC)
– Standards
• Specific dimensions called Elements of Performance (EPs)

– Today, any deficiencies observed are placed into a “SAFER” matrix
report

8

 CMS Survey Overview
CMS vs. Joint Commission
CMS has:
• Conditions of Participation
(COP)
– Overarching minimum health
& safety requirements that
Medicare has fleshed out with
targeted and more specific
Standards.

9

Joint Commission has:
• Standards
– Overarching minimum health &
safety requirements that are
fleshed out with targeted and
more specific Elements of
Performance (EP).

 Decision Making & Analysis
of Findings
Determining Deficiency Severity
• CONDITION Level deficiency:
– Noncompliance with requirements in a single standard or several
standards within a condition that represents a SEVERE and CRITICAL
health or safety breach.
• Even a seemingly small breach in critical actions or at critical times can
kill/seriously injure a patient, and represents a critical/severe health or safety
threat.

• STANDARD Level deficiency:
– Noncompliance with any single requirement or several requirements
within a particular standard that:
• Does NOT substantially limit capacity to furnish adequate care, or
• Would NOT jeopardize or adversely affect the health or safety of patients if
the deficient practice occurred.
10

 Decision Making & Analysis
of Findings
Determining Deficiency Severity

IMMEDIATE JEOPARDY
“A situation in which the provider’s noncompliance with one or
more requirements of participation has caused, or is likely to
cause, serious injury, harm, impairment, or death to a resident.”

11

•(http://www.cms.gov/manuals/Downloads/som107ap_q_immedjeopardy.pdf)

 Condition Level Findings
• Always drive a return site visit (within 45 days)
• Always trigger a Leadership citation
– Governing body failure to ensure regulations were met

12

 Plan of Correction (POC)
• Corrective action to be taken, including any system changes,
typically includes
– Review of policies and procedures
– Education of staff

• Title of the person who will monitor the corrective action
• Frequency of monitoring

 Impact of Significant Citations
• CMS CoPs: to qualify for Medicaid/Medicare reimbursement.
• State agency regulations: to maintain state licensure. License
is needed to operate a hospital.
• Significant citations: always bring negative public attention.
Negative public attention around safety and quality damages
reputation and takes years to rebuild.

15

 Environment of Care
The hospital shall maintain adequate facilities for its services
Designed and maintained in accordance with federal, state,
and local laws, regulations and guidelines (facility layout, toilets,
sinks, drinking water supply, fire suppression systems, etc.).

Designed and maintained to reflect the scope and complexity
of the services it offers in accordance with accepted standards
of practice (sufficient space to provide care, treatment and services; proper
sterilization & disinfection areas).

16

 Environment of Care
The hospital’s “Hospital Maintenance” and hospital departments or services
are responsible for the hospital’s buildings and equipment (both hospital
equipment and patient care equipment) must be incorporated into the
hospital’s QAPI program and be in compliance with QAPI requirements.

Environmental findings may include:
Missing documentation for patient or other equipment biomedical
checks
Off site locations are not included
Environmental tours not conducted
Issues reported or observed are not resolved
Environmental issues not reported to the QAPI committee or other
leadership

17

 Patient Rights
Information and engagement in decision making (including
informed consent)
Safety (including protection from abuse, self-harm, fire)
Privacy
Freedom from restraints
Access to records

18

 Quality Assessment and
Performance Improvement
The hospital must develop, implement, and maintain an effective,
ongoing, hospital-wide, data-driven quality assessment and
performance improvement program.
The hospital’s governing body must ensure that the program reflects
the complexity of the hospital’s organization and services; involves all
hospital departments and services (including those services furnished
under contract or arrangement); and focuses on indicators related to
improved health outcomes and the prevention and reduction of
medical errors.
The hospital must maintain and demonstrate evidence of its QAPI
program for review by CMS.

19

 Infection Prevention
The hospital must provide a sanitary environment to avoid sources and
transmission of infections and communicable diseases.
There must be an active program for the prevention, control, and
investigation of infections and communicable diseases.

20

 Infection Prevention Focus
Sterilization and disinfection procedures
• Focus outside main Operating Room
• Attention to pressure differentials for clean and dirty rooms
• Scopes, probes, instruments
Acceptable operating room attire: masks, shoes, hair and
fingernails
Ice machines kept clean
Air handling

21

 Medication Management
Drugs and biologicals must be controlled and distributed in
accordance with applicable standards of practice consistent
with federal and state law.

Labeling
Sound-alike, look alike drugs
Drugs with abuse potential
Therapeutic duplication
Limits on titrated drugs

 EMTALA
The Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA, 1986) requires
hospitals with emergency departments to provide a medical screening
examination to any individual who comes to the emergency department
and requests such an examination.
Key elements include:
– Medical Screening Examination by a
– Qualifying Medical Provider to ascertain if an
– Emergency Medical Condition is present (requires stabilization)
– Memorandum of Transfer if moved to another facility

23

 CMS Validation of
Accrediting Organizations
• Validation surveys (usually by state agency)
– “Complaint surveys”
– “Representative sample” within 60 days of AO
• around 100/year (of ~1200 surveyed by AOs)
• More likely for prominent institutions, or interval complaint surveys

• 2016 report to Congress
– Sensitivity of TJC to state agency survey as gold standard for condition level
findings was low
• 42% disparity rate in FFY2014

24

 Next Stroger and Ambulatory Survey
• The previous triennial accreditation survey was October 1316, 2015.
• The duration of the 2018 survey is 4 days.
• The Survey Team has expanded to accommodate the ACHN
clinics and PCMH certification.
• The Joint Commission Survey Team
– Nurse, Physician, Generalist, Administrator, Life Safety Engineer,
Ambulatory, Primary Care Medical Home and a Social Rehab Specialist

25

 New Survey Processes
• New survey report format using SAFER (Survey Analysis For
Evaluating Risk) methodology
• Identifies risk level for each finding, which determines follow
up requirements
• All findings require an ‘Evidence of Standards Compliance’
(ESC) at 60 days
• High risk findings will be monitored at future surveys
• Lower risk findings are monitored by the hospital
• Every instance of non-compliance will be cited
