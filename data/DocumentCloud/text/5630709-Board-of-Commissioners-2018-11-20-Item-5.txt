The requested action complies in all material respects with all applicable federal, state and local
laws, and Chicago Housing Authority board policies. Staff have completed all necessary due
diligence to support the submission of this initiative.

 Funding:
Administration / Human Resources Division Budget / General Fund
Background:
• BCBS’s Medical and RX 2019 renewal was initially presented with a 5.4% increase, which
through Chicago Housing Authority (“CHA”) and Broker negotiations was reduced to 3.4%
• Significantly high medical claim payments were made in the current policy period ($1.9m),
which drove up costs
• CHA’s Medical Loss Ratio is 94%, which is above industry trend primarily due to
demographics and claim utilization
• Industry is trending at 6-8% premium increases annually, taking into consideration 2019
renewal increasing by 3.4% and the 1% decreased for 2018 renewal, CHA will experience
an overall 2.4% increase over this 2-year period
• All seven lines of ancillary coverages received a rate pass (no rate change) for 2019
renewal, except for Short Term Disability (STD) which increased 1.9% due to plan design
enhancements.
Procurement Process
• HUD granted the CHA a waiver allowing us to utilize a commercial insurance broker for
procurement of all insurance
• Mesirow Financial is the CHA’s broker of record for all Employee Benefit purchases
• Section 3 does not apply to ‘supply and delivery’ contracts
• Actual premium is based on the employee census / participants in the plan; the rate for
each participant will remain constant for the policy period
