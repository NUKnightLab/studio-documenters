 (Item 1 – This number not used.)
(Item 2)
The resolution for Item 2 authorizes CHA staff to proceed with the application process for an
additional eight properties under CHA’s Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) program portfolio
award from HUD and authorize the Acting Chief Executive Officer or his designee to execute the
applications. In 2012, Congress authorized the RAD program. RAD provides an opportunity for
housing authorities to utilize either project-based voucher (PBV) or project-based rental assistance
(PBRA) contracts to stabilize funding for up to 185,000 units of public housing. A primary goal of
RAD is to use long-term contracts to leverage private financing for capital improvements while
preserving affordability. CHA submitted a portfolio application to HUD on October 24, 2013 to
transition 10,935 units within two phases under the RAD program. In June 2015, CHA received a
RAD portfolio award for 10,880 units across 63 properties via a Commitment to a Housing Assistance
Payment (CHAP) contract. The finalized RAD agreement and HAP contract is contingent upon CHA
achieving certain programmatic milestones within specified deadlines. Since the initial 2013
application, CHA has refined the list of properties to include in the RAD conversion and has requested
a substitution of some of the properties listed in the initial application. The properties listed in the
resolution were included in the 2013 application as “Phase 2” properties or have been added since the
portfolio application.
RESOLUTION NO. 2016-CHA-14
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the Board
letter dated February 16, 2016 requesting authorization to proceed with the application
process for eight properties within CHA’s RAD existing portfolio award allocation.
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY:
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners hereby authorizes CHA staff to proceed with the
application process to accommodate the following eight properties into the CHA RAD
portfolio:

Armour Square

Vivian Carter

Judge Fisher

Julia C. Lathrop Homes

Lincoln Perry

Lidia Pucinska

(Item 3)
The resolution for Item 3 approves CHA funds not to exceed $22,000,000 for redevelopment of the
Henry Horner Superblock property; approves submittal of a Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD)
Financing Plan to HUD and enters into a RAD Conversion Commitment with HUD for the Henry
Horner Superblock; approves execution of a Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) Contract for 95 RAD
units under the HUD RAD program and approves submission of a Disposition Application to HUD for
106 units.
The Henry Horner Superblock is a CHA public housing development constructed between 1995 and
1999 which consists of 201 dwelling units: 200 residential apartments and a management unit.
Currently, 142 apartments are occupied and 59 are vacant. This development is located adjacent to the
2

 original CHA Henry Horner Homes public housing site in Chicago’s Near West Side community. The
property is approximately two miles from the City’s downtown and is bounded by Damen Avenue on
the east, Leavitt Avenue on the west, Lake Street on the north and the alley north of Washington
Boulevard on the south. The Henry Horner Superblock was an early CHA mixed income development
created under the Mixed-Income New Communities Strategy (MINCS) guidelines. While all of the
units are designated as public housing, CHA adopted policy that required 50% of the units to be
offered to families with incomes at or below 50% of the area median income (AMI), and the other 50%
were allotted for households with incomes between 50%-80% of the AMI. HUD has moved away
from the MINCS approach in favor of a mixed income strategy that combines public housing with
affordable and market rate units. In 1996, CHA received a HOPE VI Revitalization Program grant
award to redevelop its Horner public housing development. Under the revitalization, CHA and the
selected development team of BMH-I, LLC have improved Horner into a new mixed income
development referred to as Westhaven Park. To date, this redeveloped site offers 579 new housing
units for public housing, affordable, and market rate families. Westhaven Park has been a successful
mixed income development. However, the location of the 100% public housing Henry Horner
Superblock property in the center of the revitalization effort has presented challenges for the successful
revitalization of Westhaven Park. Additionally, the Henry Horner Superblock property requires
substantial rehabilitation. Due to these two factors, CHA has planned for the substantial rehabilitation
of the Henry Horner Superblock property to occur simultaneously with the conversion of the property
into a mixed income development. As the developer, Brinshore-Michaels will perform substantial
rehabilitation on approximately half of the units and complete moderate renovations on the balance.
The scope of work includes unit reconfiguration, meeting accessibility requirements, and the
replacement/refurbishment of all major systems, among other unit and site improvements. This
rehabilitation activity is expected to be completed within approximately 24 months of conversion.
CHA entered into a redevelopment agreement with BMH-I, LLC, on November 19, 2002. In its
response to the Henry Horner RFQ, the Brinshore-Michaels development team’s proposal included the
potential redevelopment of the Horner Superblock site. Although the Master Development Agreement
did not include the redevelopment of the Superblock, it included an additional services provision that
allowed CHA to expand the scope of the developer’s work. Hence, the CHA board authorized the
Brinshore-Michaels development team to proceed with the redevelopment of the Superblock in 2014,
Resolution No. 2014-CHA-17.
WHP Village, LLC will be the ownership entity for this
redevelopment. CHA plans to fund approximately $22,000,000 from CHA MTW funding for the
Henry Horner Superblock redevelopment transaction. The total estimated budget for the rehabilitation
needs of the Henry Horner Superblock is approximately $62,368,638. This includes a CHA
construction loan of approximately $20,750,000 and an estimated CHA loan of $6,913,725 funded by
Donation Tax Credit equity proceeds.
RESOLUTION NO. 2016-CHA-15
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated February 16, 2016
entitled “AUTHORIZATION TO: 1) COMMIT CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
FUNDS NOT TO EXCEED $22,000,000 FOR REDEVELOPMENT OF THE HENRY

for redevelopment of the Henry Horner Superblock property; 2) Submit a Rental

This approval is subject to each Contractor’s compliance with CHA’s BE/WBE/DBE,
Section 3, bonding and insurance requirements.

(Item 4)
The resolution for Item 4 approves the 17 Development Teams listed in the resolution for subsidized
Family Housing unit delivery: The Chicago Housing Authority has refined the scope of its prequalified developer list for Pre-qualification for Development Teams (PDT) to engage development
partners for the acquisition, development and management of mixed income developments and family
units with a preference for investors in Opportunity and General Areas. CHA’s primary objective is to
provide the highest quality housing units for low-income families within diverse and healthy
communities. As part of CHA’s unit delivery strategy, the Request for Qualification (RFQ) was
created to help accomplish the Plan Forward commitment with the delivery of 25,000 units. The unit
delivery strategy plans to build on CHA’s experience working with private development teams and
owners to supply quality housing that enables low-income families to maximize their potential for
long-term economic success. The RFQ provides a method to pre-qualify developers and creates
opportunities for the CHA to provide capital loans with per unit operating subsidy for new construction
and rehabilitation of multi-family, mixed income and mixed use projects that directly benefit CHA
residents. The selected respondents will be issued a “Letter of Qualification” and have two (2) years
from the date of that letter to submit proposals to the CHA. CHA may provide financial investment or
enter into long term leases for the units, subject to Board, HUD, or other necessary approvals.
RESOLUTION NO. 2016-CHA-16
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated February 16, 2016
entitled “AUTHORIZATION TO APPROVE SEVENTEEN (17) DEVELOPMENT
TEAMS FOR SUBSIDIZED FAMILY HOUSING UNIT DELIVERY”

(Item 5)
The resolution for Item 5 approves submission of a demolition application to HUD for the demolition
of twenty-five (25) buildings within Blocks 15 and 16 at Philip Murray Homes. Under the Plan for
Transformation from 2004 – 2010, CHA undertook a massive reinvestment in the property by
rehabbing 1,323 units in Altgeld. In 2012, CHA put future rehabilitation work on hold pending a reassessment of long-term redevelopment needs at this site. CHA undertook a robust community
planning process that encouraged resident and community stakeholders’ participation. The master
planning process identified the vacant units in Blocks 15 and 16 as opportunity areas to expand
existing recreational facilities and green space. The CHA’s justification for demolition is based on the
following: the deteriorated physical condition of the properties, the physical isolation of the
development and the high density of low-income residents isolated in one community. The CHA has
determined that the subject buildings are unsuitable for their intended purposes of providing decent,
safe and sanitary housing. These buildings are in an advanced state of deterioration of both the
building exterior and interior structural systems. Mechanical equipment is non-functional and utility
pipes, conduits, wiring and fixtures are broken, missing or in poor condition. The extensive water
damage throughout has caused various masonry problems and these buildings would require mold
remediation. The advanced deterioration of these buildings would require gut rehabilitations as well as
modifications for current building code and ADA compliance.

WHEREAS,

RESOLUTION NO. 2016-CHA-17
the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated February 16, 2016
“REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION TO SUBMIT A DEMOLITION
APPLICATION TO THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN
DEVELOPMENT FOR THE DEMOLITION OF BLOCKS 15 AND 16 AT PHILIP
MURRAY HOMES”;

THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Acting Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to submit a demolition application to the U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development (“HUD”) for the demolition of twenty five (25) buildings within
Blocks 15 and 16 at Philip Murray Homes.
