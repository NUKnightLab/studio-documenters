PROPOSED LICENSE REQUEST
Request: Requesting authorization for the Forest Preserve District of Cook County (“the Preserves”), as
Licensor to grant a License to Oakton Community College, Grantee, to locate, operate and maintain a
twelve (12) inch water main across property of the Preserves to provide a secondary feed from Golf
Road. The City of Des Plaines currently provides water by a single ten (10) inch main along Central
Road, which has recently been determined to be inadequate for fire protection requirements.
Additionally, any break in the main results in complete disruption of water service to the College. The
new main would provide a looped water system to supply the needs for fire protection and continued
water supply in the event of a main break. The water main will be installed underground by directional
bore in order to minimize surface impact on the Preserves. As additional consideration for the issuance
of this License, Grantee agrees to complete a Phase 1 engineering study with a budgeted value of
$70,000.00 for a trail crossing, or to provide another benefit of equivalent value to the Preserves, subject
to the approval of the Preserves.
Term: Continuous

TEMPORARY EASEMENT REQUEST
Request: Requesting authorization for the Forest Preserve District of Cook County (“the Preserves”) to
grant a temporary easement to the Illinois Department of Transportation (“IDOT”) at Midlothian
Meadows and Oak Forest Heritage Preserves, along the west side of Pulaski/Crawford Avenue at 159th
Street for 0.557 acres or 24,276 square feet.
Reason:
IDOT requests a temporary easement along the west side of Pulaski/Crawford Avenue to
construct a ten (10) foot wide paved, shared use path connecting the south entrance of Midlothian
Meadows to the Oak Forest Heritage Preserve. IDOT originally proposed a pedestrian path on the east
side of Crawford but agreed to relocate this to the west side to connect two (2) Forest Preserve trails at
Midlothian Meadows and the Oak Forest Heritage Preserves.

IDOT will construct the path with a 20% cost share with the Preserves, estimated at $16,000.00. IDOT
has offered to pay the appraised value of the temporary easement as an easement fee but Forest Preserve
staff is recommending waiver of tree mitigation fees because the project benefits the Forest Preserves.
The path will be constructed as part of improvements to the intersection of US Route 6 (159th Street)
and Pulaski/Crawford Avenue. The improvements include traffic signal replacement with bicycle and
pedestrian crossing. The temporary easement is for five (5) years or until completion of construction,
whichever comes first.
The area for the temporary easement is 0.557 acres. IDOT indicates that a yet to be determined number
of trees are expected to be removed for this project.
Term: Five (5) years or until completion of construction, whichever comes first
