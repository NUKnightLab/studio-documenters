AUTHORIZATION TO ENTER INTO A CONTRACT WITH VERIZON WIRELESS
TO PROVIDE MOBILE SERVICES AND EQUIPMENT

To the Honorable Board of Commissioners:

RECOMMENDATION

It is recommended that the Board of Commissioners (?Board?) authorizes the Chief Executive
Of?cer or his designee to enter into a contract with Verizon Wireless for Mobile Services and
Equipment in the amount not-to-exceed $636,454 for three (3) years.

The Executive Vice President of Finance, the Of?ce of the General Counsel and the
Of?ce of Procurement have completed all necessary due diligence to support the submission of
this initiative and recommend the approval of this item accordingly.

CORPORATE GOAL
Streamline operations to make the Chicago Housing Authority more customer-focused
and ef?cient.

The current mobile voice and data services are challenged by outdated equipment and
services, low phone reception, frequent loss of Internet connectivity, inef?cient email services,
and the service costs are not economical. The existing vehicle tracking system is paper-
driven and is inef?cient in keeping up with vehicles? locations and maintenance. This initiative
will enable the CHA to incorporate updated technology with its mobile services and equipment
coupled with a new web ?eet management system and enhanced online account management
serv1ces.
