Rural Advisory Council Meeting
June 28, 2019
NOACA Offices
1299 Superior Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio 44114
Present: Please see the attached attendance record.
Ms. Jeanene Kress, Chair of the Rural Advisory Council (RAC), convened the meeting at
1:04 p.m.
Meeting Minutes
A motion was made by Ms. Kyle White to approve the minutes of the RAC meeting held on
March 22, 2019. The motion was seconded by Mr. John Oros. The motion passed by voice vote.
Public Comments
No comments were made at this meeting.
Executive Director’s Report
Ms. Grace Gallucci asked RAC members to assist NOACA in advocating for the Irishtown Bend
project, which involves replacing the bulkheads that are deteriorating and falling into Cuyahoga
River. She noted that if repairs are not made, it would prevent companies from shipping and there
would be a $3 billion annual economic loss. She said NOACA is trying to be proactive by getting
the bulkheads fixed now.
Ms. Gallucci mentioned that NOACA submitted an INFRA Grant application requesting $15.7
million for the Irishtown Bend project. She noted that the application has been placed on
Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao’s desk for consideration.
Ms. Gallucci stated that a grassroots effort is being made to get funding for the Irishtown Bend
project. She named several elected officials who have either contacted Secretary Chao or are
planning to contact her about this project. Ms. Gallucci informed RAC members that they will
receive a fact sheet with links to contacts and a report that explains Irishtown Bend’s impact on
communities in the region. She asked members to share the information with legislators and
constituents in their communities.
Ms. Kress asked if staff’s request is time sensitive. Ms. Gallucci said yes and noted that a decision
will be made on the application in a couple of weeks. Ms. Gallucci noted that businesses in
Northeast Ohio may be directly or indirectly impacted by the $3 billion economic loss.
NOACA Geauga County Build Project Update
Ms. Kate Moening stated that the Geauga County Amish Safety project was developed as a result
of the 2015 strategic safety plan that identified rural safety improvements for motorists, Amish
buggies, and pedestrians. Ms. Moening mentioned that NOACA was awarded a $9.6 million
8273c
1-1

 BUILD Grant for the project that has a total cost of $14.3 million. She said NOACA is providing
$1.5 million in Transportation Alternatives Program (TAP) funds that was approved by the Board
in June 2019. Ms. Gallucci explained how TAP funds can be used.
Ms. Moening stated that the project includes widened shoulders, warning and detection signal
systems, and signage improvements for motorists and pedestrians. The current activities include
an approach for project administration, project programmed with completed funding, the
consultant selected to perform preliminary development and detailed design services, and the
draft US DOT BUILD project agreement.
Ms. Moening presented the following schedule for the project:
Begin preliminary engineering and design

Ms. Moening stated that NOACA staff will continue to inform RAC throughout the project
development and implementation.
Mr. Oros asked if pedestrian facilities will be looked at for the end product. Ms. Moening stated
that she was not aware of specific details, but heard there will be a buffer for pedestrian activity,
additional signage, probably youth education for pedestrians, and rectangular rapid flashing
beacons (RRFBs) for crossings at non-intersection areas.
Mr. Oros asked if the project is still in the design phase. Ms. Moening said yes.
Geauga County FPA – Prescriptions for Wastewater Treatment Modification in Chardon
Township
Mr. Eric Akin provided background on the 208 Plan and the Geauga County FPA modification
request approved by the Board in June. He noted that the request involves the transfer of 124
parcels (141 acres) and a prescription change in Chardon Township from “no sewer service” to
“may be sewered.”
Mr. Akin reviewed the affected area, wastewater timeline issue, sewage system summary,
notification requirement, and analysis. He mentioned that NOACA staff submitted the FPA update
to Ohio EPA for certification by the Governor and transmitted copies of the resolution to the
appropriate federal, state and local agencies.
Ms. Cotman asked how the project is funded. Mr. Akin stated that there will be an assessment of
each property of $25,000-$30,000 that will probably be paid over 20-30 years with the property
tax. The homeowner will have to pay an upfront cost of $200 to the county for connection.
Ms. Christin Brandon asked if the lot size of the adjourning properties was looked at for failing
septic systems or just the lots identified in the request.
Mr. Akin stated that the subdivision mentioned in this request has small lots and the houses on
the lots were built in the 1950s and 1960s, while the neighboring subdivision has large lots and
8273c
1-2

 the houses were built in the 1980s and 1990s. Mr. Akin stated that if there was an issue with the
neighboring subdivision, a request would have to be submitted to NOACA to allow for connection.
Coordinated Public Transit-Human Services Transportation Plan for Northeast Ohio
Ms. Sarah White provided background on the Coordinated Plan; discussed the public outreach
that was done; talked about how feedback was gathered from various sources and goals were
developed for the future and strategies for implementation. She mentioned that NOACA is the
designated recipient of FTA Section 5310 program funds for the Cleveland Urbanized Area (UZA).
Currently, NOACA directs at least 60% of the funds to transit agencies and up to 40% of the funds
to other specialized transportation providers. She noted that NOACA will use the Coordinated
Plan as an evaluation tool to prioritize Section 5310 funding and guide current and future regional
needs.
Ms. White mentioned that the NOACA Board of Directors approved Mobilize: Accessibility for
Independence as the Coordinated Public Transit-Human Services Transportation Plan for
Northeast Ohio for the years 2019-2022.
Mr. Tim Stahlberg asked if the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority (GCRTA) was
involved in the public outreach. Ms. White said yes.
Ms. Kress asked if NOACA’s goal is to provide services to areas currently not being served in the
region. Ms. White stated that NOACA wants to keep exploring coordination efforts. Ms. White
talked about the Senior Transportation Connection working with GCRTA.
Ms. Gallucci stated that the Coordinated Plan is intended to fill transportation gaps. She noted
that some communities have applied for funding through NOACA so they can purchase a van to
transport seniors and individuals with disabilities. She stated that the Coordinated Plan applies
to many cases in rural areas.
Project Planning Reviews (PPRs)/Intergovernmental Review and Consultation (IGRC); 1st
Quarter State Fiscal Year (SFY) 2020
Mr. Ed May provided background on PPR and presented information on the following projects:
•

CUY – 43-1.98 (Widening Aurora Road from Solar Shopping Center Drive to Liberty
Road) – This project involves the following roadway improvements: pavement
resurfacing, minor widening, new traffic signal at Portz Parkway, 10’ multi-use path on
the south side, bike lane westbound (5’ sidewalk) on the north side, new water line
and storm sewer. The total cost of this project is $8.1 million. No NOACA funds will
be used.

•

CUY IR 480 06.47/VAR Paint PID 22131 (Bridge Painting on IR-480 and SR10 in
Fairview Park and Cleveland) – This project involves painting the structural steel of the
bridges. The total cost of this project is $34.5 million. No NOACA funds will be used.

 Mission Advancement Initiatives
Ms. Danielle Render stated that the division of External Engagement and Public Affairs will
support RAC with its 2019 focus areas.
Ms. Render stated that an External Affairs Operating model has been developed to focus on
several areas built around the following:
•
•
•
•

Roles and responsibilities
Leadership
Organizational structure
Communications, advocacy, public engagement and efforts to build stronger stakeholders
relationships

Ms. Render provided an overview of the platform NOACA is looking to create. She asked RAC
members if they were willing to develop a working committee to assist NOACA with devising a
plan of action and discuss how the council can help NOACA connect to the rural community;
discuss areas of growing the rural economy and leverage transportation networks to markets and
farms; provide direction to facilitate ongoing engagements; and elevate NOACA’s position and
priorities.
Ms. Render stated that the working committee could have a brainstorming session at NOACA
offices or members could participate via conference call. She noted that the goals are to have a
purpose, leverage NOACA’s network, maintain ongoing communication, provide guidance and
support, bridge new ideas and strategic initiatives, and provide a stronger link with both local and
national communities.
Ms. Render stated that building relationships to support legislative needs will help NOACA deliver
its mission and strategic plans to its network and create opportunities for partnerships. She
mentioned that there are no financial impacts. She stated that the next steps involve staff setting
up a working meeting in July-October; creating an agenda for RAC discussions; leveraging a
network/introducing a detailed plan in September; and having ongoing communications / an event
to support the agenda / plan.
Mr. Oros stated that the Farm Bureau plays a big role in rural communities and would be a good
stakeholder group to speak to about transportation needs and agritourism.
Ms. Kress suggested that NOACA staff contact the Ohio Township Association, Coalition of Large
Ohio Urban Townships (CLOUT), and Ohio State University Extension.
Ms. Gallucci stated that the working committee will give RAC members an opportunity to think
about how to advance the needs of NOACA; how NOACA can meet the needs of the rural
communities; and provide RAC members an opportunity to provide suggestions on how NOACA
can do a better job.
Ms. Kress asked if RAC members will receive some information. She suggested that staff find
out the best time to contact trustees who may have another job and look at the network’s strengths
and weaknesses. Ms. Render stated that staff would be willing to visit the communities.
Ms. Kress suggested that RAC members think about the best places to hold meetings in their
communities.

 Mr. Oros commented on how visiting communities will give NOACA staff a better understanding
of how transportation relates to the economic impact of tourism, agritourism and rural needs.
Ms. Leslie Gambosi-McCoy invited NOACA staff to Middlefield Village’s quarterly Economic
Development Committee meeting held at the Village Hall. She noted that the location of the
Village Hall is convenient for Amish residents to attend meetings.
Ms. Kress suggested that staff reach out to the chambers of commerce in the region.

Ms. Kress announced that the next RAC meeting will be held at the NOACA offices on
September 27, 2019 at 1:00 p.m. There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned

RE:

Air Quality Public Education and Outreach Strategy Update

ACTION REQUESTED
No action is requested at this time. This item is for information only.
RACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION FOR CURRENT ACTION
In June 2017, the NOACA Board approved a contract with Markey Group, a communications consulting firm,
to develop an Air Quality Public Education and Outreach Strategy, and an accompanying Communication
Plan. These documents will guide NOACA’s air quality public outreach activities over the next 5-10 years.
Most importantly, these documents will guide implementation of NOACA’s Regional Strategic Plan, and help
bring the region into compliance with the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s (U.S. EPA’s)
National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).
Draft Air Quality Public Education and Outreach Strategy and Communications Plans are now complete. The
Strategy identifies gaps in existing air quality programming in the region, and will engage the community
(individuals, employers, health care organizations, and educational institutions) in actions aimed at improving
air quality during its implementation. The Communication Plan, in conjunction with the Strategy, provides
specific direction to NOACA staff regarding air quality messaging to the public – via NOACA’s website, social
media, special events, paid advertising, and other forms of communication.
The final goals and objectives of the documents will be presented during the Rural Advisory Council’s
September meeting. The draft documents can be accessed through the links below for your review.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact related to this presentation.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
NOACA will implement both the Strategy and the Communications Plan as part of its FY 2020 and FY 2021
work program. NOACA staff may provide updates on implementation at future meetings.

RE:

SFY 2021 – 2024 TIP Projects Recommended for NOACA Funding

ACTION REQUESTED
No action is requested at this time. This item is for presentation and discussion only.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION FOR CURRENT ACTION
On September 13, 2019, the NOACA Board of Directors approved 99 new projects totaling $148 million of
NOACA funding for implementation in the Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) for State Fiscal Years
(SFY) 2021-2024. The projects are funded through NOACA administered Surface Transportation Block
Grant (STBG), Transportation Alternatives (TA) and Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ)
programs. The TIP will contain all road, bridge, public transit, and other transportation projects scheduled
for implementation within NOACA’s five counties, supported by NOACA program funds and other federal
funds controlled through ODOT, or by other direct recipient governmental agencies.
The universe of identified needs considered for NOACA funding included approximately 700 community and
regional projects totaling more than $1 billion needed for implementation through the 2021-2024 TIP
timeframe. Given limited resources, the projects approved for NOACA funding were demonstrated to best
represent priorities contained in the AIM Forward 2040 long-range transportation plan, while also aligning
with established State and Federal transportation performance management initiatives.
The projects were evaluated by staff against recommended regional significance and planning criteria and
considering geographic equity and whether they are located in an Environmental Justice, Urban Core, or
Disadvantaged Community. The projects approved for NOACA administered funds are attached. Staff will
present a summary of the funded projects to the Council at its September 27, 2019 meeting.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The approved program of projects will commit a total of $148 million of NOACA STBG, TA, and CMAQ
funds for SFYs 2021 through 2024.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Staff will work with project sponsors to finalize project scope, schedule and budget for incorporation into the
draft 2021-2024 TIP, along with non-NOACA funded projects. The final draft TIP will be presented to the
Planning and Programming Committee for recommendation at its January 17, 2020 meeting.

 NORTHEAST OHIO AREAWIDE COORDINATING AGENCY
MEMORANDUM
TO:

NOACA Rural Advisory Council

FROM:

Grace Gallucci, Executive Director

DATE:

September 20, 2019

RE:

Planning Reviews (PPRs)/ Intergovernmental Review and Consultation (IGRC); 2nd
Quarter State Fiscal Year 2020

ACTION REQUESTED
No action is requested at this time. This item is for information and presentation only.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION
Attached are PPR summary documents for the proposed projects to be presented to the NOACA
Transportation Subcommittee, Planning and Programming Committee and Executive Committee for review
and recommendation.
NOACA’s Board approved Regional Transportation Investment Policy requires that all proposed federal-aid
transportation projects be processed through PPR in order to meet NOACA’s adopted goals and federal
requirements.
PPR consists of four levels of review: NOACA staff; Board, including committees, subcommittees, and
councils: intergovernmental review and consultation (IGRC); and public involvement. The end product of
PPR is a Board resolution that certifies that the project has had thorough review, allowing the project to
proceed to the programming stages of the planning process.
As part of the PPR process, a detailed summary of the proposed improvement and staff and committee
assessment of the project are posted on NOACA’s website, www.NOACA.org. A link to the PPRs is
included on the home page by clicking the ‘Comment on Projects’ button. Staff adds comments obtained
from the public, governmental organizations and NOACA committees as they are received. Proposed
projects are posted on the website for three months, allowing adequate time for review and comment.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Pending Board approval, project sponsors will be notified that their projects have completed PPR. NOACA
staff will work with project sponsors to address any planning issues identified during PPR.

 RTA Fiscal Year 2020 Capital Grant Program
Sponsor: RTA
Estimated Total Cost: $54,519,373
Proposed Source of Federal Funds: Federal Transit Administration (FTA)
History/Background: RTA reports that its original state fiscal year (SFY) 2020 grant program is
listed in the NOACA SFY 2018 – 2021 Transportation Improvement Program and the majority of
the program is as originally proposed in the TIP. RTA is adding four new projects to its FFY 2020
program and the TIP. RTA is also seeking to revise and amend five existing grants to address
under-runs, over-runs, and revised priorities in its capital program impacting eleven TIP projects.
RTA’s revisions to the FFY 2019 and 2017 Capital Formula and FFY 2016 State of Good Repair
grant programs reflect these revisions.
Proposed Project: RTA is applying for various sources of funds including Section 5307 Capital
Formula, Section 5337 State of Good Repair Formula and Section 5339 Bus and Bus Facilities
Formula for FFY 2020, as described below:
•

The Section 5307 Capital Formula projects include Bus Replacement Program Vehicles
and Spare Parts, Substation Improvement Program, Cuyahoga Viaduct Track Bridge, Light
Rail Track Rehabilitation, Bus Spare Parts Program, Rail State of Good Repair, Bus
Preventive Maintenance, Enhanced Rail ADA (Americans with Disabilities) Access, NOACA
Unserved Areas Projects, (new) Rail Car Replacement Program, (new) Track Bridge over
Conrail and (new) HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) System Improvement
Program.

•

Section 5337 Rail Formula projects include Substation Improvement Program, Cuyahoga
Viaduct Track Bridge, Light Rail Track Rehabilitation, Rail Spare Parts Program, Rail State
of Good Repair Projects, Rail Preventive Maintenance, Rail Infrastructure Program, On-Call

Utility Vehicle Prime Mover Replacement.

•

Section 5339 Bus and Bus Facilities Formula projects include Bus Replacement Program
Vehicles and Spare Parts.

RTA is also seeking to revise and amend five existing grants to address updated funding amounts,
projected under-runs, over-runs and revised priorities in its Capital Program as described below:
•

2019 Section 5307 Capital Formula Grant – The grant is being revised and amended to
account for decreased funding as well as to decrease Bus Preventive Maintenance and
NOACA Unserved Area funding, shift Bus Vehicle Type funding, fund the West 117th Street
Track Bridge and its Rail Car Replacement Program.

•

2019 Section 5337 State of Good Repair Formula Grant – The grant is being revised and
amended to account for decreased funding as well as to decrease Rail Preventive
Maintenance and West 117th Street Track Bridge funding and fund the Rail Car
Replacement Program.

•

2019 Section 5339 Bus and Bus Facilities Formula Grant – The grant is being revised and
amended to account for increased funding and to increase the funding for Bus
Replacement Program Vehicles.

 •

2017 Section 5307 Capital Formula Grant – The grant is being revised and amended to
account for separating the design and construction phase costs for Light Rail Signal
System, from East 79th Street to Shaker Square.

•

2016 Section 5337 State of Good Repair Grant - The grant is being revised and amended
due to under-runs in the West Park Diamond Crossover and Red Line West Track

 NORTHEAST OHIO AREAWIDE COORDINATING AGENCY
MEMORANDUM
TO:

NOACA Rural Advisory Council

FROM:

Grace Gallucci, Executive Director

DATE:

September 20, 2019

RE:

Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District (NEORSD) 2020 Green Infrastructure Grant

ACTION REQUESTED
No action is requested. This item is for information and discussion.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION FOR CURRENT ACTION
The Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District (Sewer District) supports the strategic implementation and longterm maintenance of green infrastructure that protects, preserves, enhances, and restores natural hydrologic
function, including funding green infrastructure projects within the combined sewer area through the Green
Infrastructure Grants (GIG) Program. Green infrastructure refers to stormwater source control measures that
store, filter, infiltrate or evapotranspirate stormwater to increase resiliency of infrastructure by reducing stress
on wet weather drainage and collection system thereby supporting healthy environments and strong
communities.
The GIG Program for the Combined Sewer Area is open to member communities, governmental entities, nonprofit organizations 501(c)(3), or businesses working in partnership with their community in the combined
sewer area interested in implementing water resource projects that remove stormwater from the combined
sewer system and in ensuring the long-term maintenance of the green infrastructure practices.
On September 6, NOACA submitted its proposal for “Net Zero Cool,” a three-phase, comprehensive suite of
stormwater control measures (SCMs) to reduce stormwater runoff from its 100% impervious downtown
Cleveland site and mitigate runoff’s harmful impacts on the Frontal Lake Erie-Doan Brook Watershed.
The objectives and outcomes for Net Zero Cool are embodied in its name. “Net Zero” refers to NOACA’s
ambition to capture stormwater runoff from its impervious surface area and eliminate its contribution to the
combined wastewater/stormwater conveyance system. “Cool” refers to NOACA’s ambition to showcase its
green infrastructure elements with eye-catching, water-themed design; mural and green wall on the sides of
the building; educational placards along the sidewalk, adjacent to a proposed bioretention system and
outdoor classroom space on the green roof for lectures, tours and public meetings. According to the Green
Infrastructure Grants Program Story on the Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District’s (NEORSD’s) website,
there were no green infrastructure grants (GIGs) awarded to organizations located in Downtown Cleveland
(inside the Innerbelt, east of the Cuyahoga River) in the years shown (2014, 2016, 2018, 2019). Net Zero
Cool would make NOACA a true vanguard for NEORSD-funded green infrastructure implementation; a
marquee to illuminate the tremendous benefits of green infrastructure in Downtown Cleveland.
NOACA procured a design/engineering team to explore opportunities through site visits, preliminary design
proposals and stormwater modeling. NOACA will release an RFP to hire a design-build firm, conditional on
5 - 27

 NEORSD funding, in mid-September. NEORSD will announce GIG awards in November and funded
projects will begin January 1, 2020.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
NOACA may receive a GIG award from NEORSD in November; NOACA has committed a 20% match of total
project costs.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Pending NEORSD award of funds, NOACA staff will submit a design-build proposal and contract to the
Board for review and approval at its December meeting.
