 1a. Variance Request:
The applicant is requesting a variance from Road Frontage requirements, Section
1505.05(e) Access to Public Streets, as the property in question is to be used as educational
uses. An agreement with adjoining owners will allow the Storage Zone to use this parcel
and access the parcel to the south with access off of Canton Rd.
1505.05(e) Access to Public Streets. Unless otherwise permitted herein, the
subdividing of land whether as a Major or Minor Subdivision, shall provide each lot
with a minimum of thirty (30) feet of continuous frontage on a dedicated street. Access
to public streets shall comply with the Access Management Manual.
The following narratives were submitted in response to the questions posed in the variance
application. Staff comments are bold and italicized.
i.

Are there exceptional topographic or other physical conditions peculiar to
this particular parcel or land? If, so please explain.
Owner wishes to split the subject parcel and sell to CZ Canton Road LLC
who will develop ancillary offices and provide for the adjacent Storage
Zone parcel access to Canton Road. The Storage Zone parcel, which abuts
Canton Road, is too narrow for this purpose and subject to drainage
easement making access to Canton Road and further development of the
Storage Zone unfeasible.
No.

ii.

What is the unnecessary hardship which will result from a literal
enforcement of the Subdivision Regulation owing to the special conditions
set forth in subparagraph (i.) herein?
The subject parcel cannot be split, sold and developed without the variance,
traffic congestion in the residential on Shanafelt Ave. will continue, since
street access to Storage Zone parcel is solely via Shanafelt Ave, and Storage
Zone can’t expand to provide for offices. This is a hardship on local
residents and Storage Zone.
There would be no unnecessary hardship.

iii.

Did the special conditions specified in subparagraph (i.) result from
previous actions by the applicant? Please explain.
No.
No.

 iv.

Explain whether the variance requested is substantial.
The requested variance is not substantial and is the minimum needed for the
development.
The variance request is substantial, as the applicant is requesting a full
exemption from the regulations.

v.

Explain whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be
substantially altered or whether adjoining properties would suffer a
substantial detriment as a result of the variance.
No. The variance will allow the development and use of the subject parcel
in a manner that is consistent with the commercial character of the
surrounding area. The subject parcel is now vacant and there are no other
plans to develop it.
The essential character of the neighborhood would not change with the
granting of the variance nor would adjoining properties suffer substantial
detriment.

vi.

Will the variance adversely affect the delivery of governmental services,
including but not limited to, access by firefighting apparatus, law
enforcement vehicles, ambulance and emergency vehicles and similar
services relative to ingress and egress to the affected site and adjacent land?
No, the variance would enhance the delivery of governmental services, such
as fire, police and EMS, to the adjacent Storage Zone parcel.
With access easements on adjoining property, this variance would NOT
adversely affect the delivery of governmental services, including but not
limited to, access by firefighting apparatus, law enforcement vehicles,
ambulance and emergency vehicles and similar services relative to ingress
and egress to the affected site and adjacent land.

vii.

Explain whether the Subdivision Regulation was in effect at the time of
acquisition of the property by the applicant and whether the applicant
purchased the property with the knowledge of the Regulation.
Yes.

viii.

Explain whether the applicant’s predicament can be feasibly solved through
some method other than a variance.
The purchase by SZ Canton Road LLC of the subject parcel from the Owner
is contingent on obtaining the requested variance. If the variance is not
granted, buyer will not purchase the subject parcel.

 Per the applicant the current Storage Zone parcel cannot have the
proposed split parcel joined to it due to financial reasons, so other than
acquiring land that has existing frontage a variance is the only way to
solve this issue.
ix.

Explain how the variance from the Subdivision Regulations will not be
contrary to the public interest.
The variance is not contrary to public interest and will serve the public
interest by (i) providing for the development of the subject parcel which
would otherwise remain vacant, (ii) alleviating congestion on Shanafelt
Ave, and (iii) providing better access to the adjacent parcel for fire, police,
and EMS services.
This variance would not be contrary to public interest as the access and
use would not pose a threat/concern to public safety or the character of
the neighborhood.

x.

Explain how the spirit and intent behind the Subdivision Regulations will
be observed if the variance is granted.
The variance meets the objectives of Section 1101.02 of the Regulations by
providing (i) the orderly, efficient and appropriate development of the
subject parcel, (ii) alleviating congestion on Shanafelt Ave., (iii) the sage
and convenient vehicular movement along Canton Road and Shanafelt
Ave., and (iv) adequate and convenient access for public services.
The spirit and intent of the following purposes and objectives of the
Regulations as listed in § 1101.02:
(a)
The proper arrangement of streets or highways in relation to existing
or proposed streets and highways and the thoroughfare plan.
This does not proposed to alter streets or highways.
(b)
Adequate and convenient open spaces for traffic, utilities, access for
firefighting apparatus, recreation, light and air, and the avoidance of
congestion of the population.
With access easements on adjoining property, this variance would
NOT adversely affect the adequate and convenient open spaces for
traffic, utilities, access for firefighting apparatus, recreation, light
and air, and the avoidance of congestion of the population.
(c)
The orderly, efficient, and appropriate development of land.
The variance request is for full exemption from having public
street frontage.
(d)
The orderly and efficient provision of community facilities at
minimum cost and maximum convenience.
This would not impact the orderly and efficient provision of
community facilities.
(e)
Safe and convenient vehicular and pedestrian movement.

 (f)

(g)
(h)

xi.

This would give the option of having the storage zone traffic come
off of Canton Rd rather than Shanafelt Ave.
The promotion of public health, safety, comfort, convenience,
prosperity, and general welfare, and the protection of the
environment.
This would give the option of having the storage zone traffic come
off of Canton Rd rather than Shanafelt Ave.
The accurate surveying of land, preparing and recording of plats.
This would not impact the accurate surveying of land, preparing
and recording of plats.
The equitable handling of all subdivision plats by providing uniform
procedures and standards for observance by both the approving
authority and Developer as defined herein.

Explain how the requested variance is the minimum variance to the
Subdivision Regulations that will allow for a reasonable division of land.
The variance is the minimum needed to provide the subject parcel with the
required frontage to Canton Road to allow the parcel to be sold and
developed.
Per the applicant the current Storage Zone parcel cannot have the
proposed split parcel joined to it due to financial reasons, so other than
acquiring land that has existing frontage a variance is the only way to
solve this issue.

Staff Comments: Variances are to alleviate unnecessary hardships imposed by literal
enforcement of the subdivision regulations due to exceptional topographic or other physical
conditions peculiar to a parcel.
The Fiscal Office said they would accept this proposed split if Springfield Township, The
County Engineer and the Planning Commission approve it.
Staff Recommendation: Staff recommends the SCPC DISAPPROVE the Variance
Request.
1b. Lot Split:
The applicant proposes to split land parcel 5110796 to create two parcels, parcel 1, 0.7058
Acres, and parcel 2 0.7737 Acres.
Staff Recommendation: Staff recommends the SCPC CONDITIONALLY APPROVE
the Lot Split upon the condition of the split getting a variance for 1505.05(e) Access to
Public Streets.

[1] This permit is not a substitute for satisfying the rights or obligations of any other party who may have an interest in the underlying
fee interest.
[2] The granting of this permit does not convey to the permittee or to the property served any rights, title, or interest in state highway
rights of way or in the design or operation of the state highway; or in any way abridge the right of the Director of the Department of
Transportation in his jurisdiction over state highways. If, in the process of any future work or for the benefit of the traveling public, it
becomes necessary, in the opinion of the Director of Transportation to order the removal, reconstruction, relocation, or repair of any
of the fixtures, or work performed under this permit, said removal, reconstruction, relocation, or repair shall be wholly at the expense
of the owners thereof or the permittee and be made as directed by the Director of Transportation. Such changes in the state highway
design or operation, necessary for improved safety and operation or for the benefit of the traveling public, shall not require a permit
modification since the permit confers no private rights to the permittee over the control of the state highway.
[3] The District Deputy Director acts for and on behalf of the Director in issuing and carrying out the provisions of all permits. The
District Deputy Director has full authority to ensure that all provisions of the permit are met and to reject any materials, design, and

revocation, or annulment of the permit thereby rendering the permit illegal and subject to appropriate Departmental action. By
accepting the permit, the permittee agrees to comply with all conditions, terms, and restrictions printed or written on or attached to the
permit. If the permittee performs any work contrary to the conditions of the permit or to the instructions of the District Deputy
Director and, after due notice, fails to correct the problem, the Department of Transportation may, with or without notice, correct such
work and the permittee shall reimburse the Department for the costs.
[5] The permittee shall indemnify and hold harmless the State of Ohio, Department of Transportation, its officers, representatives and
assigns, from any and all loss, liability, damages, litigation costs, and claims for injury or death to any person, property, or business
