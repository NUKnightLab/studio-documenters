The Village intends to use each of these three buildings for industrial and
commercial development. They are not part of our 138th Street Corridor Plan;
however, they are adjacent to the southern border of the Plan area and have
similar characteristics as those properties in the Plan area. The Village intends
to develop the properties in the same spirit as the 138th Street Corridor Plan in
order to expand tax revenues. Currently, there is no third-party-applicant for
any of the parcels.

The Village agrees to report the status of each parcel to the Cook County
Department of Economic Development annually for five consecutive years or
until the intended use is complete, whichever is last. Also, the Village will apply
for tax exempt status on each parcel once a tax deed is obtained until a
developer is designated.

The Village has retained the Law Offices of Kenneth W. Pilota and shall bear all
costs to proceed to tax deed and perform all legal and other activities
associated with this program.

*Referred to the Committee on Tax Delinquency Subcommittee on 09-03-
08.

Ken Pilota, Esq., Law Offices of Ken Pilota, stated that, with regard to these three parcels, the
Village of Riverdale has not yet identified a third party, but would like to acquire these parcels
and prepare them for future commercial and industrial redevelopment.

Ms. Malito stated that it is very difficult at present to determine the occupancy of these parcels.
She state that she did see some trucks which look new at the location; the village stated in its
package that it an excavating company is occupying the property.

Janice Morrissy, Director, Community/Economic Development, Village of Riverdale, stated that
the property is occupied by an excavating company; there may be materials dumped on site,
possibly environmental hazards, and the property shows sign of deterioration. The last time she
checked they did not have a business license. it is her understanding that the owner died.

Chairman Sims stated that it needs to be determined whether the property is occupied. If

someone owns it, it is Cook County's policy that they are afforded the opportunity to pay back
taxes.

Randolph Johnston, Assistant State?s Attorney, stated that there may be a lease or rental
agreement between a business that may be there and the owner. He advised that it would be
the safest course to defer this item until it is determined whether this is a leasing situation.

Commissioner Butler, seconded by Commissioner Murphy, moved the approval of
Communication Number 295884. The motion carried.

CLIENT PRIVILEGE

Honorable Deborah Sims .
Cook County Commissioner, 5th District

Re: Tax Delinquency Committee Meeting October 14, 2008

Dear Commissioner Sims:

You have asked this Of?ce about the status of the Tax Delinquency Committee meeting
that was called to order at 10:00 a.m. on October 14, 2008. The Committee did not have
a quorum, and was recessed and reconvened to October 15, 2008.

Pursuant to the Rules of Organization and Procedure of the Cook County Board of
Commissioners (the ?Board Rules?), the rules of procedure for committee meetings shall
be the same as for the Board (except for the quorum size requirements). Board Rules,
Section The lack of a quorum at any Board meeting shall cause the meeting
to stand adjourned from day to day, to the same hour of the day, until a quorum is
present. Beard Rules Section Thus, the lack of a quorum at the October 14'h
Tax Delinquency Committee meeting caused the meeting to stand adjourned from day to

day, at the same hour (10:00 am.) until such time as a quorum of the Committee is
present.

Moreover, it is our understanding that you, as Chair of the Tax Delinquency Committee,
speci?cally recessed the October 14th Meeting until 9:45 a.m. on October 15th. If this is
accurate, this recess to a time certain, which is more speci?c than an adjournment from
day to day, would control. Either way, the Tax Delinquency Committee is properly
noticed for a meeting on the morning of October 15? 2008.

Sincerely,

istant State?s Attorney

Honorable Deborah Sims

Cook County Commissioner

Chairman, Tax Delinquency Sub-Committee
118 North Clark, Room 567

Chicago, IL 60602

Dear Commissioner Sims:

The Village of Riverdale sincerely appreciates the County?s assistance,
support and partnership in our economic development efforts. The
Board has assisted us in numerous Ways, including participation in the
County?s No?Cash Bid Program.

As you will recall, at yesterday?s Tax Delinquency Sub-Committee
meeting the Village brought forth three PINS for participation in the
No?Cash Bid Program. It was agreed that PINS 29-04?108-019-0000
and 29?04?108-028-0000 would be brought forward at today's Board
meeting. The Village is requesting that PIN 29?04?108-023?0000 also
be brought forward for consideration as well so that our economic
development work is not delayed.

When it appeared that the property might be occupied, the
Commissioners at the Tax Delinquency Sub-Committee mentioned
yesterday that the County wants to give the owners of properties that
are occupied a chance to pay the taxes. It is my understanding that
this system is already in place. I thought that the County mails a
notice to the tax assessee at least 30 days prior to the County making
the tax buy. Also, I thought that the entire tax deed procedure is
loaded with notice serving requirements once the tax buy is made, and
that there will be no less than another four (4) notices that either the
owner and/or tax assessee receives before a deed can be issued.

Another important point to the Village is that there are at least 20

years of open taxes on this property. Excavating is not
contributing to the Village's tax base, employing a recognizable

?Best Little Village of Illinois"

amount of people, or offering a service that is bene?cial to the Village
or our residents. The County is reaping no bene?t either. 
Excavating is just using the pr0perty as a dump site for potentially
hazardous materials. The best thing that can happen is that the
Village takes over the property and start redeveIOping it to benefit the
County, Village and our residents.

You may also be interested in knowing that our Public Works facility is
located in the same vicinity as this property, and they have not seen
any activity at the property in approximately one and half m0nths.
Based on our knowledge, the property is not being leased.

To reiterate, the Village is requesting that PIN 29-04-108?023?0000
also be brought forward for consideration at today County Board
meeting so that our economic development work is not delayed.
Please be assured that the Village will work with the County to secure
additional information about occupancy status of the property while
the County works through the initial steps of purchasing this property
through the No Cash Bid Program.

Thank you for your consideration of this matter. Should you have any
questions, please call me at 708?932-6360.

Sincerely,
Janice L. Morrissy, Director
Community Economic DeveIOpment
