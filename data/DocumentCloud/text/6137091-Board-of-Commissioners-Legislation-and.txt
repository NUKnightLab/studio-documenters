PROPOSED RESOLUTION

 

RESOLUTION URGING LEGISLATION THAT WOULD REQUIRE CELL
PHONE PROVIDERS TO KEEP IDENTIFICATION OF ALL CELL PHONE
USERS ON FILE

WHEREAS, human traf?cking is de?ned by the United States Department of State as
?activities involved when one person obtains or holds another person in compelled service;
and 

WHEREAS, an estimated 2.5 million people, 80 percent of whom are women and girls,
worldwide are victims of this modern day form of slavery; and

WHEREAS, in the city of Chicago and suburban Cook County someone is reported
missing every 30 minutes, many of those are girls as young as twelve years old who are
held against their will and fall victim to Human Traf?cking; and

WHEREAS, recent statistics have named Human Traf?cking the second largest most
pro?table criminal enterprise among members of organized crime and violent street gangs;
and

WHEREAS, modern technology allows traf?ckers to operate virtually undetected by the
use of social media where many victims are forced to pose for humiliating and degrading
pictures that are then posted on the internet and available to be viewed by individuals
seeking to engage in sexual acts in exchange for money further contributing to the sexual
exploitation; and

WHEREAS, one of the most valuable resources available to traf?ckers to continue to
remain undetected while maintaining constant communication with victims of Human
Trafficking, their associates, and potential customers is the use of cellular phones; and

WHEREAS, no contract prepaid cell phones are referred to on the street as burners or drop
phones and are impossible to track because phone carriers do not require a contact, photo
identi?cation or a minimum age; and

WHEREAS, in instances where law enforcement?s only lead in rescuing a kidnapped
victim is being able to determine who a cell phone number is registered too, can be the
difference between life and death.

NOW, THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that the President and Cook County Board of
Commissioners urges the United States Congress and the Illinois General Assembly to
pass legislation that would require all cell phone carriers to secure and keep on ?le photo
identi?cation which includes a physical address from any person wishing to obtain a
cellular phone whether or not a contract is involved.

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that this resolution be presented to the President of the
United States, the legislative leaders of Congress from both political parties, the Governor
of the State of Illinois, the legislative leaders of the General Assembly from both political
parties and all Members of Congress who represent Cook County and all Members of the
Illinois General Assembly who represent Cook County.
