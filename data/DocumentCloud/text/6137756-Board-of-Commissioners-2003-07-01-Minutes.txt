The ICJIA made the request for approval of the contract with very short notice, necessitating the request
for approval before the contract could be completed.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: None. Grant Award: $3 8,839.00. Funding period: August I , 2003 through

Class 4 property as "real estate owned and used by a not-for-profit corporation in furtherance
of the purposes set forth in its charter unless used for res idential purposes"; and
WHEREAS, if a corporation is registered as a not-for-profit with the Secretary of State 's
office, it can file an appeal with the Assessor's Office requesting a classification change for
its properties to Class 4, which lowers the assessment level from 38% to 30% of fair market
value; and
WHEREAS, the change to not-for-profit status results in a 21 percent tax reduction each
year; and
WHEREAS, any property not classified as a not-for-profit or not owned by a religious
organization is deemed Class 5 property and assessed at 38% of its fair market value; and
WHEREAS, not-for-profit status is in place until the property is sold or it violates its status;
and
WHEREAS, not-for-profit corporations occasionally stray from their mission or fail to abide
by the words and intent of their charters.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT ORDAINED BY THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS
OF COOK COUNTY,
Any taxpayer in Cook County shall have standing, and may petition the Cook County Board
of Review, to revoke a property's Class 4 Classification. The Board of Review shall revoke
the Class 4 status and re-classify the property as Class 5 if, based on a preponderance of the
evidence, petitioner's evidence and publicly-available facts demonstrate that the not-forprofit owner has operated contrary to the letter and intent of its charter.

Cook County Code is hereby amended, and shall read as follows:
I 0-4:

That all bids shall be opened and tallied at a time predetermined by the President, who shall

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY I, 2003

This Ordinance shall be effective upon passage.

NOTE:
259404).

This item was also referred to the Finance Committee. (See Comm. No.

*Referred to the Administration Committee on 5/20/03.
Chairman Hansen stated that at the request of the primary sponsor, Communication No. 259403 should be
received and filed.

Vice Chairman Butler, seconded by Commissioner Gorman, moved to receive and file
Communication No. 259403. The motion carried.
Chairman Hansen made reference to a letter dated May 28, 2003 from the Office of the Purchasing Agent
regarding Bid Opening Procedures. Chairman Hansen stated that Ray Robin, Purchasing Agent has
compiled what is an ideal procedure for the conduct of opening of bids. He stated that in the past the
opening of bids has been taken lightly, he stated that thi s is a serious responsibility. At this time,
Chairman Hansen stated that the committee is not proposing to adopt it as an ordinance at this time, but
would like to recommend that a copy of the letter be sent to all the commissioners for their review and
comments.
Commissioner Steele stated that in the letter from the Purchasing Agent, on page 2 should it say that the
bid box is to be "closed" instead of "opened".
Ray Robin stated that the announcement that is generally made is: "the hour having reached I 0:00 a.m.
no more bids may be accepted".
Ray Robin stated that the statement could be changed to: "the bid box is to be closed and no more bids
may be accepted, please bring in the bids".
Commissioner Stee le stated that looking into the future the commissioners should not be involved in the
bid process at all. Commissioner Steele stated that it was dangerous to keep having staff open the bid
packages with the kind of wrapping that the bids are wrapped. Further, Commissioner Steele stated that
futuristically the county should think about purchasing a program where bidders can bid-on-line. She
referenced a program that is being marketed out of South Carolina where bidders can go on-line and bid.
Commiss ioner Steele stated that she wo uld like to bring the program in and give a demonstration to the
committee to see how it operates.
Ray Robin stated that he is not aware of the system that Commissioner Steele is making reference to, but
he would be glad to look into it.
Commiss ioner Steele stated that the company that demonstrated the system to her was at a NA Co meeting
and they are based out of South Carolina.
Commissioner Murphy stated that the on-line process is a good process, but the bids should be coded so
that the bid is not disclosed to the next person. Chairman Hansen stated with the agreement of the
committee he would like to have Ray Robin report back after looking into what the possibilities are of
e lectronic handling of the county ' s bidding procedure.

2033

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY I , 2003

Ray Robin stated that he would look into it and report back to the committee.
Chairman Hansen stated that he would like to circulate the letter with the correction to all commissioners
at the request of the committee and return comments to the committee w ith regards to the suggested
procedure.
C hairman Hansen stated that in the back up there is a Bid Opening Schedule for 2003, he asked if it
should be changed to having two commissioners for each bid opening meeting with the first
commissioner being the one that should serve and the second one being an alternate or leave it like it is.
Vice Chairman Butler stated that he would opt to leave it like it is.

Chairman Collins noted that based on the amount of space and the number of children to be serviced, the
State of Illinois has established laws for day care centers and ratios are included in this legis lation.
Additionally, there are local ordinances which deal with child staff ratios.
Commissioner Hansen is concerned that the Department of Planning and Development is not providing
the committee with concrete numbers for proposed j obs.
C hairman Collins stated that Commissioner Hansen's point is well taken and in the future she will request
the Department of Planning and Development supply the committee with the estimates of how many jobs
will be created.
Commiss ioner Hansen suggested that the Department of Planning and Development give the committee a
memorandum with the estimated j o bs that will be created before the Board meeting.
Commiss ioner Murphy stated that the county should have an obligation to revisit the businesses after six
months or a year to make certain that they have hired the number of people they said they would. If they
have not the county should have a process where by the county could take away the tax incentives that
were g iven to them when they first applied.
Chairman Collins commented that Commissioner Murphy's suggestion was a g reat idea. C hairman
Co llins stated that she had spoken to the Department of Planning and Development about an agreed time
where the Business and Economic Development Committee can review all of the Class 6b and C lass 8

A RESOLUTION REGARDING THE DEMOLITION OR REUSE OF COOK COUNTY
HOSPITAL (PROPOSED RESOLUTION). Submitting a Proposed Resolut ion sponsored by
Peter N. Silvestri and Larry Suffredin, County Commissioners; Co-Sponsored by Mike
Quigley and Joan Patricia Murphy, County Commissioners.
PROPOSED RESOLUTION

WHEREAS, the decision to demo lish Cook County Hospital was made in 1999 based on a
1988 study and a limited exam ination of space alternatives to meet zoning requirements; and
WHEREAS, that decision was based primarily on a 1988 study that focused on the
rehabilitation and reuse of the structure for the purposes of a hospital or for educational and
offices uses for the hospital ; and
WHEREAS, in 1988 there was not a significant track record of redevelopment of buildings
of this s ize, and s ince that time, great strides have been made in the rehabi litation/reuse of
large historic structures, such as Medinah Temple, the Reliance Building, the Montgomery
Ward Warehouse, Chicago 's Theatre District, and the Milwaukee County Hospital; and
WHEREAS, federal and local tax credits and incentives of more than $20 million are in
place now that did not exist when the study was done, drastically improving the economic
feasibility of such a project that can have mixed uses, inc luding medical offices, clinic space,
medical conference space, retail for medical staff and the community and res idential units;
and
WHEREAS, Cook County Hospital is significant both as one of the city's best examples of
Beaux Arts-style architecture and for its national historic significance treating the indigent
and developing innovative treatments for such things as burns and sick le cell anemia; and
WHEREAS, every new citizen group of Cook County was treated with dignity and medical
expertise at Cook Coun ty Hospital from 191 4 to 2003; and
WHEREAS, in part because of its architectural and historic s ignificance, Cook County
Hospital was chosen to be the model for the television series "ER", and the fa9ade of the
hospital has since become a symbol of Chicago recognized around the world; and
WHEREAS, in addition to historic and architectural benefits, preservation of s uch structures
serves as an economic catalyst to the area; and
WHEREAS, redeveloping the main hospital site excluding the Children ' s Hospital, power
plant, I 2KV Building and other additions would put the two-block-long property on the tax
rolls and meet all required zoning; and

2044

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY I, 2003

WHEREAS, much of the "demolition preparation contract" (approved 8/ 1/02) focused on
planning efforts, including building documentation, utility relocation plans, and asbestos and
other environmental removal, initiatives that would have to be done regardless of whether the
building is demolished or reused; and
WHEREAS, a contract for the actual demolition has not been proposed, rev iewed o r
approved; and
WHEREAS, actual demo lition will cost the County from $20-$30 million and the actual tax
credits a developer could pay the County are in excess of $20 million, in addition to future
real estate tax revenues; and
WHEREAS, demolition and creation of another passive park, s imilar to Pasteur Park will
have no direct community benefits; and
WHEREAS, a reuse of the building has many direct community benefits; and
WHEREAS, although the discussion to cons ider demolishment of the hospital goes back as
far as 1988, the demo lition or preservation of the structure will be a major decis ion of this
Board of Commissioners, many of whom have little to no information about the project.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and Board of Commissioners
of Cook County ho ld a hearing to discuss the demolition or reuse of the hospital and to
cons ider the cost savings that could result from the main hospital building's reuse, in whole
or in part without any financial contribution from the County of Cook, prior to proceed ing
w ith a demo lition contract.
*Referred to the Construction Committee on 6/17/03.
Health and Hospitals Committee Chairman Butler noted that the first order of business would be a
presentation by Commissioner Suffredin followed by public testimony. The chairman also entered a
letter into the record from State's Attorney Richard Devine. (The referenced document is on file in the
Office of the County C lerk.)
Pres ident Stroger referred to a letter dated June 23, 2003 from the Cook County State' s Attorney wherein
the Office opines that the county is o bligated to demo lish the former hospital building. President Stroger
asked that this letter be made a part of the record.
Commissioner Suffredin commented that he and Commissioner Silvestri, the co-sponsor of the proposed
resolution would make statements while images of the 19 14 main hospital building would be shown on a
projection screen. The commi ssioner noted that the issue is not with the C hildren' s Hospital, power plant,
I 2KB Building or the finger addit ions on the south s ide of the 1914 ma in hospital building, wh ich they
be lieve should be demolished, but the issue is with the demolition of the 19 14 main hospital building as it
was when it first opened. He further noted that the proposed resolution is consistent with the State's
Attorney 's opi nion. He said the planned development issued by the C ity of C hicago, to which the
Medical District and Cook County complied, calls for 40 percent building occupancy and the county is
currently 5 percent out of compliance. He further noted the proposed reso lution suggests certain
buildings be demo lished and w ith the construction of the planned parking lot, the county would then
come within compliance.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JU LY I, 2003

Commissioner Suffredin, citing a legal opinion from the State's Attorney, commented that an amend ment
would have to be approved by the County Board to make the changes. He stated that the reason we
believe these changes are reasonable is because many things have happened in the law and in society
s ince the Board passed the resolution in April I 999 to demolish all the existing buildings. There are
federal tax credits totaling $20 million that the current administration has expanded that are now available
for anyone who comes up with a reuse proposal. The commissioner concluded his remarks by stating that
there are other needs in the Medica l District such as medical offices, medical conferencing and very little
housing for medical personnel.

Commissioner Silvestri noted that the proposed resolution calls for a meeting to be held to determine if
there is interest in redeveloping the main hospital building at no cost to the taxpayers. Before the final
demolition occurs, the Board should have an opportunity to see if there is re-adaptive use for the building
not only for historic reasons but also for the financial cons ideration of the cost of demolition.

Commissioner Suffredin then referred to the slide presentation and noted that the County has set-aside
between $20 and $30 million in bonds for the demolition costs. The County can save between $I 5 and
$20 million ifthe main 19 14 hospital building is not demolished. He noted that there are fou r ways the
County can financially benefit from reusing the building: I) saving the demolition costs, 2) because there
is $20 million in tax credits, have a developer who would pay a portion of that to access those credits, 3)
the building would go back on the tax rolls and the County would receive real estate property taxes and 4)
the County would have the ability to share in rent and other revenues that would come from the building.

Commissioner Suffredin stated he had spoken to four maj or developers who indicated that if the County
had a full hearing, and if they were given the opportunity to look at the building, they be lieve that capital
for this ty pe of proj ect would be avai lable given the current economy. He further stated the County could
do a mixed-use building that would include medical offices, conferencing space and some residences. He
noted the County is bound by federal law to do the environmental c lean-ups whether the building is
demolished or re-used. The commissioner urged an affirmative vote on the proposed resolution, and
ended his remarks by say ing that havi ng a full hearing on this subject is in the best interest of the people
of Cook County and that ultimately there may be a cash flow swing of between $30 to $50 million .

Referring to a document prepa red by the Bureau of Health Services, Health and Hospital s Committee
Chairman Butler commented that while the main hospita l building is open and inoperative, it is not
empty. He noted that to keep the building open, the weekly operating costs total a little more than
$74,000. The cha irman then asked that the document be entered into the record. (The referenced
document is on file in the Office of the County C lerk.)

Commissioner Murphy remarked that the current operating costs for the main hospital building would
have to be paid until a decision is made regarding demolition of the building. She noted that the operating
costs would still have to be paid regardless of the hearings. If no viable responses were received for
possible reuse of the building, then the vote would go toward demolition. The time it would take to hold
hearings is very short but the gain to the County, if it is reused, could be very great.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY I, 2003

President Stroger commented that he understands the sentimental value of saving the old hospital
building for historical reasons and to meet the need for more housing, but currently there is an
abundance of housing in the area. The President reiterated his commitment to abiding by the
previously signed documents and the best interests of the public would be served by demolishing the
old hospital building. President Stroger noted that because there is a lack of adequate hospital parking
the County is currently shuttling staff back and forth from the hospital to the Juvenile Temporary
Detention Center, which has had added costs to the budget. The President remarked that he
understands that the sponsors of the proposed resolution want the public to be involved in the process.
He concluded by asking that the following documents be entered into the record : the State's Attorney 's
legal opinion, letter from the Illinois Medical District and the engineer' s report. (The referenced
documents are on ti le in the Office of the County CI erk.)
Commissioner Hansen noted that the question of the future of the main hospital building has been before
the County for many years and previous comments have suggested that from a financial perspective, the
building can be saved and simultaneously have the taxpayers come out ahead. The commissioner urged
closer examination of the proposed reso lution based on the above statements. Commissioner Hansen
further noted that the Administration Building (the former School of Nursing), supports the retention of
the main hospital building since it is on the list to be demolished. He said that hospital staff currently
housed in the Administration Building could be moved to the renovated main hospital building. The
commissioner noted that hearings should be held to determine if there is a residual value to the building in
addition to aesthetics, in a financial sense, and as a residence for physicians. He concluded by saying that
the Board has an opportunity to save something that was previously described as Cook County's Statute
of Liberty.
Health and Hospitals Committee Chairman Butler then called for testimony from the following public
speakers:
Mr. David Bahlman, President
Mr. Peter Decamp

Commissioner Steele commented that several proponents of the proposed resolution discussed preserving
the main hospital building and converting it to either physician offices, a health club, a spa, rehabilitation
center, a Ronald McDonald House, but a developer has not come forward with any definitive plans.
In response to a question by Commissioner Steele, Assistant State's Attorney Elizabeth Reidy remarked
that the fact that the previous County Board acted to approve plans for demolition does not prohibit it
from taking another action. The Board could approach the Illinois Medical District seeking an
amendment to their Master District Plan that would accommodate plans for the preservation of the former
main hospital building.

2047

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY I, 2003

President Stroger noted that the County Board is part of the Illinois Medical District since the Board
voted to approve developing the District to preserve the practice of medical and education in that
geographic area. He said although many of the plans previously discussed may be good plans, they are
not consistent with the original concept of the Medical District. The President referred to a letter from
the former C hicago Planning Commissioner, Christopher Hill whose department had control over
zoning and special uses, which the County Board has followed . The President also noted that the
hospital might need additional land to conduct research and bring the down costs. He further stated
that many hospital artifacts can and will be saved before demolition.
In response to a question from Commissioner Collins, Michael LaMont, Director of the Office of
Capital Planning and Policy stated that demolition cost estimates have not been formally presented to
the Board because his office has been working with consultants. Mr. LaMont indicated that the Office
of Capital Planning and Policy and the consultants have examined the buildings to determine the
amount of asbestos removal, how much abatement is required, and other necessities. He stated that a
document previously distributed at today's meeting that reflects approximately $20 million, which is
still an estimate and until the work is bid, the County will not know the exact costs.
Commissioner Collins reiterated her concerns regarding the County having adequate estimates so that
once the County moves forward the public will not feel they have been deceived by doubling or tripling
the costs.
In response to comments from President Stroger, Michael LaMont read into the record a summary of
activities that have taken place and the demolitio'n plan that includes cost estimates. Mr. LaMont
indicated that two types of work will take place: abatement/environmental remediation and the
demolition . He said estimates were developed based on 50 percent complete contract documents and he
does not expect final costs to deviate greatly. The estimates include a 5 percent contingency for
environmental work and the estimate for this work (including the contingency) is $8.9 million for the
powerhouse, the Children 's Hospital and the Main Hospita l. He said estimated costs for the demolition
work and s ite work associated with bringing the site back up to ground level for all three buildings is $9.7
million. Mr. LaMont noted that the estimated total is slightly less than $20 million but stated that the
County might want to increase the contingency to I 0 percent, which would increase the figures.
In response to President Stroger's comments regarding environmental issues, Mr. LaMont stated that
these issues g reatly impact on the contingency range and estimates. He concluded by saying that until the
building is completely examined and the abatement activity started, it would be difficult to pinpo int exact
costs.
In response to Comm issioner Suffredin ' s question regarding the document on Abatement Activity
Duration, Mr. LaMont noted that every thing is premised on the County Board's permission to advertise
contracts in July because of the 3 to 4 month purchasing process prior to the County actually applying for
the permits. Mr. LaMont indicated that he did not believe informational hearings could be conducted
during this time period without holding up demolition plans because the Office of Capital Planning &
Po licy intended to request permission to advertise for the abatement and demolition at the July Board
meeting. The next step would be to proceed to have the plans out for competitive bid since there are no
Board meetings planned for the summer and any action to have hearing would impact this timeline.
Michael LaMont commented that for historical purposes, consideration has always been given to
architecturally salvaging certain hospital artifacts for historical purposes as reflected in the Demolition
Plan.

In response to President Stroger' s comments, Chairman Sims noted that the hospital columns on the old
building are crumbling and not as so lid as they appear. T he commissioner indicated that the architects
believe the figureheads on the buildings can be salvaged in addition to saving the hospital entrance and
making it a walk-through to the park as a way of saving part of the hospital's history.
Chairman Sims declared that the next meeting of the C onstruction Committee would be at 10:00

BUREAU OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND AUTOMATION, by Catherine
Maras O'Leary, ChiefTnformation Officer, transmitting a Communication:
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to increase by $I , I 43,250.00, Contract No.
01-41- I 139 with AVAYA, INC., Lis le, 1llinois, for installation of a state of the art telephone
system.
Board approved amount 06-19-0 I :
This increase requested:
Adjusted amount:
Reason:

$3 ,200,000.00
I, I 43,250.00
$4,343,25 0.00

This request is for the purchase of additional telecommunications equipment for
the Stroger Hospital of Cook County campus. In 200 I, the telecommunications
needs of Stroger Hospital of Cook County were estimated and Avaya, Inc. was
awarded a contract for the work. After that procurement, additional dial tone
requirements for the hospital medical systems and the increased voice/data
requirements in the Administration and Hektoen buildings were identified by the
Bureau of Health Services. These additional requirements were for an additional
2,200 dial tones. Now, additional Avaya equipment is required to provide for the
telecommunication needs of the Administration and Hektoen buildings.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $1, I 43,250.00. Bond Issue (20000 Account).
Sufficient funds have been appropriated to cover this request.

*Referred to the Construction Committee on June 17, 2003.
Commissioner Hansen asked if someone from the Department for Management of Information Systems
could give an explanation.
Karen Griffin, Bureau ofTnformation Technology and Automation stated with the construction of the new
hospital there were estimates made with regards to dial tones needed and there are more dial tones needed
than originally estimated due to additional staffing in the Administration Building and needs of medical
equipment that was new to the new hospital.
Commissioner Hansen asked what was the original estimate.
Karen Griffin stated that the original estimate was I, I 00 dial tones.
Commissioner Hansen asked how can the numbers be that far off.
Chairman Sims stated that when the equipment was ordered some of the equipment that was used in the
old hospital didn ' t require use of a telephone line and now the new equipment for the new hospital
requires a telephone line.
Commissioner Hansen stated that the number of dial tones needed is two hundred percent more than was
estimated.

2050

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY I, 2003

Chairman Sims stated that there is state-of-the-art equipment in the new hospital.
Karen Griffin stated that there are a total of 4,000 dial tones for the new hospital and campus, so there are
an additional I, I 00 dial tones. Ms. Griffin stated that originally I, I 00 dial tones scheduled for the
Administration Building and now they need 2,200 in the Administration Building.
Kare n Griffin stated that in order to get the new hospital opened they took dial tones from the original
master plan for the entire campus that had been allocated to the Administration Building and s hifted those
dial tones over to the hospital, which is fully complete, and now the 2,200 are needed for the
Administration Building.
Commiss ioner Hansen asked who made the estimate.
Ms. Griffin stated that MIS was given the number of dial tones needed by the Bureau of Health Services
consultants. She further stated that the Department of Central Services built the te lephone system for
which they were g iven the specifications.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question regarding who the consultant' s were, Karen Griffin
stated it was C rystal Communications.
Commissioner Hansen asked Karen Griffin to get a letter from Crystal Communications stating why they
were so far off.
Chairman Sims stated that Karen Griffin would get the letter for the commissioner.
Commissioner Peraica stated that if Crystal Communications or any other consultants were provided with
the specifications to provide a dollar amount for what needed to be done to comply with the spec ifications
and didn' t, the contract should be looked at for possible legal actions because the county re lied on the
consultants information .
Commissioner Peraica stated that the county paid the consultants a lot of money to foresee the changes
and the fact of the matter is they did not.
Chairman Sims asked Lacy Thomas to respond to the commissioner.
Lacy T homas, Chief Operating Officer, stated that he would like to clarify what Karen Griffin was
disc ussing with respect to the telecommunication consultants.
Mr. Thomas stated that Crystal
Communications was engaged to do the new hospital telecommunications planning . The lines were
de livered to the hospital 2 I /2 years prior to the equipment being delivered. Further, Mr. T homas stated
that the equ ipment acquisition was an ongoing process and the county did not know all the
telecommunications equipment needed until s ix months prior to the hospital being opened. That is the
reason why the decision was made to take lines that had been initially designated for the Administration
and the Hektoen Building to o pen the new hospital with the additional equipment requirements. In
clos ing Mr. Thomas stated that it was nothing that Crystal Communications could have foreseen, because
they were not equipment consultants they were strictly telecommunications.
President Stroger stated that Commissioner Peraica should respect the staff.

205 1

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY I, 2003

Commissioner Murphy stated that she agrees with Commissioners Peraica and Hansen that the staff has
done an excellent job but the job of consultants is their expertise and their expertise should have shown
them even two years ago when the equipment started coming in that they needed more lines in the
hospital. The fact that they didn' t they should be held accountable. The county needs to go back and
look to find out when we knew what kind of equipment was coming to the hospital and where the
consultants were at that time and why they didn ' t see it.
Chairman Sims called on Michael LaMont to respond.
Michael LaMont, Director of the Office of Capital Planning and Policy, stated that the county is paying
the same amount for the number of lines in the increase. He stated that the consultant did the best they
could 2 l /2 years ago to estimate what would be happening with the equipment and also the move of
personnel at the new Stroger Hospital of Cook County. With respect to equipment the county had many
situations where we had to rebid equipment, because the Office of Capital Planning and Policy did not
know all of the equipment needs until the last minute. Secondly, Mr. LaMont stated that 2 1/2 years ago
the Office of Capital Planning and Policy didn't know exactly who was moving from the old buildings
into the Hektoen or the Administration Buildings. Further, Mr. LaMont stated that the funding for this
item is in the contingency for the telephone system project and the funding is there.
Commissioner Silvestri asked if there are any determinations that the consultant failed to comply with
their contractual obligations.
Michael LaMont stated that at the time the consultant worked with the plans that they had and worked
with the equipment that they knew was being purchased, but all the equipment was not purchased until I
l /2 years ago.

Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Moreno moved approval of Communication
No. 259871. The motion carried.

259883

A RESOLUTION REGARDING THE DEMOLITION OR REUSE OF COOK COUNTY
HOSPITAL (PROPOSED RESOLUTION). Submitting a Proposed Resolution sponsored by
Peter N. Silvestri and Larry Suffredin, County Commissioners; Co-Sponsored by Mike
Quigley and Joan Patricia Murphy, County Commissioners.
PROPOSED R ESOLUTION

WHEREAS, the decision to demolish Cook County Hospital was made in 1999 based on a
1988 study and a limited examination of space alternatives to meet zoning requirements; and
WHEREAS, that decision was based primarily on a 1988 study that focused on the
rehabilitation and reuse of the structure for the purposes of a hospital or for educational and
offices uses for the hospital; and
WHEREAS, in 1988 there was not a s ignificant track record of redevelopment of buildings
of this size, and since that time, great strides have been made in the rehabilitation/reuse of
large historic structures, such as Medinah Temple, the Reliance Building, the Montgomery
Ward Warehouse, Chicago's Theatre District, and the Milwaukee County Hospital; and
WHEREAS, federal and local tax credits and incentives of more than $20 million are in
place now that did not exist when the study was done, drastically improving the economic
feasibility of such a project that can have mixed uses, including medical offices, clinic space,
medical conference space, retail for medical staff and the community and residential units;
and
WHEREAS, Cook County Hospital is significant both as one of the city's best examples of
Beaux Arts-style architecture and for its national historic significance treating the indigent
and developing innovative treatments for such things as burns and sickle cell anemia; and
WHEREAS, every new citizen group of Cook County was treated with dignity and medical
expertise at Cook County Hospital from 1914 to 2003; and
WHEREAS, in part because of its architectural and historic significance, Cook County
Hospital was chosen to be the model for the television series "ER", and the fa9ade of the
hospital has since become a symbol of C hicago recognized around the world ; and
WHEREAS, in addition to historic and architectural benefits, preservation of such structures
serves as an economic catalyst to the area; and
WHEREAS, redeveloping the main hospital site excluding the Children's Hospital, power
plant, I 2K V Building and other additions would put the two-block-long property on the tax
rolls and meet all required zoning; and
WHEREAS, much of the "demolition preparation contract" (approved 811 /02) focused on
planning efforts, including building documentation, utility relocation plans, and asbestos and
other environmental removal, initiatives that would have to be done regardless of whether the
building is demolished or reused; and
WHEREAS, a contract for the actual demolition has not been proposed, reviewed or
approved; and

2067

 JOURN AL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY I, 2003

WHEREAS, actual demo lit ion w ill cost the County from $20-$30 mill ion and the actual tax
credits a developer could pay the County are in excess of $20 million, in addition to future
real estate tax revenues; and
WHEREAS, demolition and creation of another passive park, s imilar to Pasteur Park will
have no direct community benefits; and
WHEREAS, a reuse of the building has many direct community benefits; and
WHEREAS, although the discussion to cons ider demolishment of the hospital goes back as
far as 1988, the demo lition or preservation of the structure w ill be a maj or decision of this
Board of Commissioners, many of whom have little to no information about the proj ect.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and Board of Commissioners
of Cook County ho ld a hearing to discuss the demolition or reuse of the hospital and to
consider the cost sav ings that could result from the main hospita l building's reuse, in who le
or in part without any financ ia l contribution from the County of Cook, prior to proceed ing
with a demo lition contract.
C hairman Butler noted that the first order of bus iness would be a presentat ion by Commissioner Suffredin
fo llowed by public testimony . The chairman also entered a letter into the record from State 's Attorney
Richard Devine. (The referenced document is on file in the Office of the County C lerk.)
President Stroger referred to a letter dated June 23 , 2003 from the Cook County State ' s Attorney wherein
the Office o pines that the county is obligated to demolish the former hospita l bui lding. President Stroger
asked that this letter be made a part of the record.
Commissioner Suffredin commented that he and Commissioner Silvestri, the co-sponsor of the proposed
reso lution would make statements while images of the 19 14 main hospital build ing would be shown on a
proj ection screen. The commissioner noted that the issue is not with the Children' s Hospita l, power plant,
I 2KB Building or the finger additions on the south s ide of the 191 4 ma in hospital building, which they
believe should be demolished, but the issue is with the demo lition of the 1914 ma in hospital building as it
was when it first opened. He further noted that the proposed resolution is consistent w ith the State's
Attorney' s opinion. He said the planned development issued by the City of Chicago, to which the
Medical District and Cook County complied, calls for 40 percent building occupancy and the county is
currently 5 percent o ut of compliance. He furth er noted the proposed resolution suggests certain
buildings be demolished and w ith the construction of the planned parking lot, the county would then
come within compliance.
Commissioner Suffredin, citing a legal opinion from the State's Attorney, commented that an amendment
would have to be approved by the County Board to make the changes. He stated that the reason we
believe these changes are reasonable is because many things have happened in the law and in society
s ince the Board passed the resolution in April 1999 to demolish all the existing build ings. T here are
federa l tax credits totaling $20 million that the current administration has expanded that are now available
for anyone who comes up with a reuse proposal. The comm issioner concluded his remarks by stating that
there are other needs in the Medical District such as medical offices, medical conferencing and very little
housing for medical personnel.

2068

 JOURNA L O F PROCEEDINGS FOR J ULY I, 2003

Commissioner Silvestri noted that the proposed resolution calls for a meeting to be held to determine if
there is interest in redeveloping the ma in hospital building at no cost to the taxpayers. Before the final
demo lition occurs, the Board should have an opportunity to see if there is re-adaptive use for the building
not only for historic reasons but also for the financ ial consideration of the cost of demolition.
Commissioner Suffredin then referred to the s lide presentation and noted that the County has set-aside
between $20 and $3 0 million in bonds for the demo lition costs. The County can save between $ 15 and
$20 million if the main 1914 hospita l building is not demo lished. He noted that there are fo ur ways the
County can fi nanc ially benefit from reusing the building: I) saving the demolition costs, 2) because there
is $20 million in tax credits, have a developer who would pay a portion of that to access those credits, 3)
the building would go back o n the tax rolls and the County would rece ive real estate property taxes and 4)
the County would have the ability to share in rent and other revenues that would come fro m the building.
Commissioner Suffredin stated he had spoken to fo ur maj or developers who indicated that if the County
had a full hearing, and if they were given the opportunity to look at the building, they be lieve that capital
for this type of proj ect would be available given the current economy. He further stated the County could
do a mixed-use building that would include medical offices, conferencing space and some residences. He
noted the County is bound by federal law to do the enviro nmental c lean-ups whether the building is
demolished or re-used. The comm iss ioner urged an affirmative vote on the proposed resolution, and
ended his remarks by saying that having a fu ll hearing on this subject is in the best interest of the people
of Cook County and that ultimately there may be a cash flow swing of between $3 0 to $50 millio n.
Referring to a document prepared by the Bureau of Health Services, Chairman Butler commented that
while the ma in hospita l building is open and inoperative, it is not empty . He noted that to keep the
building open, the weekly operating costs total a little more than $74,000. The chairman then asked that
the document be entered into the record. (The referenced document is on file in the Office of the County
C lerk.)
Commiss ioner Murphy remarked that the current operating costs for the main hospital building would
have to be paid until a decis ion is made regarding demolition of the bu ilding. She noted that the operating
costs would still have to be paid regardless of the hearings. If no viable responses were received for
possible reuse of the building, then the vote would go toward demo lition. The time it would take to ho ld
hearings is very short but the gain to the County, if it is reused, could be very great.
Pres ident Stroger commented that he understands the sentimental value of saving the o ld hospital building
for historical reasons and to meet the need for more hous ing, but currently there is an abundance of
hous ing in the area. The President reiterated his commitment to abiding by the prev iously signed
documents and the best interests of the public would be served by demo lishing t he o ld hospita l building.
President Stroge r noted that because there is a lack of adequate hospital parking the County is currently
shuttling staff back and forth from the hospita l to the Juve nil e Temporary Detention Center, which has
had added costs to the budget. T he President remarked that he understands that the sponsors of the
proposed resolution want the public to be involved in the process. He concluded by ask ing that the
fo llowing documents be entered into the record : the State's Attorney's legal opinion, letter from the
Illino is Medica l District and the engineer's report. (The referenced documents are on file in the Office of
the County C lerk.)

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY I, 2003

Commissioner Hansen noted that the question of the future of the main hospital building has been before
the County for many years and previous comments have suggested that from a financial perspective, the
building can be saved and simultaneously have the taxpayers come out ahead. The commissioner urged
closer examination of the proposed resolution based on the above statements. Commissioner Hansen
further noted that the Administration Building (the former School of Nursing), supports the retention of
the main hospital building since it is on the list to be demolished. He sa id that hospital staff currently
housed in the Administration Building could be moved to the renovated main hospital building. The
commissioner noted that hearings should be held to determine if there is a residual value to the building in
addition to aesthetics, in a financial sense, and as a residence for physicians. He concluded by saying that
the Board has an opportunity to save something that was previously described as Cook County's Statute
of Liberty .
Chairman Butler then called for testimony from the following public speakers:

Mr. William Wendt

Commissioner Steele comm ented that several proponents of the proposed reso lution discussed
preserving the main hospita l building and converting it to either physician offices, a hea lth club, a spa,
rehabilitation center, a Ronald McDonald House, but a developer has not come forward w ith any
definitive plans.
In response to a question by Commissioner Steele, Assistant State's Attorney Elizabeth Reidy remarked
that the fact that the previous County Board acted to approve plans for demolition does not prohibit it
from taking another action. The Board could approach the Illinois Medical District seeking an
amendment to their Master District Plan that would accommodate plans for the preservation of the former
main hospital building.
President Stroger noted that the County Board is part of the Illinois Medical District s ince the Board
voted to approve deve loping the District to preserve the practice of medical and education in that
geographic area. He said a lthough many of the plans previous ly discussed may be good plans, they are
not consistent with the orig ina l concept of the Medical District. The President referred to a letter from the
former C hicago Planning Commissio ner, Christopher Hill whose department had control over zoning and
special uses, which the County Board has followed. The Pres ident also noted that the hospital might need
additional land to conduct research and bring the down costs. He further stated that many hospita l
artifacts can and will be saved before demolition.
In response to a question from Commissioner Collins, Michae l LaMont, Director of the Office of Capital
Planning and Policy stated that demolition cost estimates have not been formally presented to the Board
because his office has been working with consultants. Mr. LaMont indicated that the Office of Capital
Planning and Policy and the consultants have examined the buildings to determine the amount of asbestos
removal, how much abatement is required, and other necessities. He stated that a document previous ly
distributed at today 's meeting reflects approximately $20 million, which is still an estimate and until the
work is bid, the County will not know the exact costs.

2070

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY I, 2003

Commissioner Collins reiterated her concerns regarding the County having adequate estimates so that
once the County moves forward the public will not feel they have been deceived by doubling or tripling
the costs.
In response to comments from Pres ident Stroger, Michael LaMont read into the record a summary of
activities that have taken place and the demolition plan that inc ludes cost estimates. Mr. LaMont
indicated that two types of work wi ll take place: abatement/environmental remediation and the
demolition. He said estimates were developed based on 50 percent complete contract documents and he
does not expect final costs to deviate greatly. The estimates include a 5 percent contingency for
environmental work and the estimate for this work (including the contingency) is $8.9 million for the
powerhouse, the Children's Hospital and the Main Hospital. He said estimated costs for the demolition
work and site work assoc iated with bringing the site back up to ground level for all three buildings is $9. 7
million. Mr. LaMont noted that the estimated total is slightly less than $20 million but stated that the
County might want to increase the contingency to I 0 percent, which would increase the figures.
In response to President Stroger's comments regarding environmental issues, Mr. LaMont stated that
these issues g reatly impact on the contingency range and estimates. He concluded by say ing that until the
building is completely examined and the abatement activ ity started, it would be difficult to pinpoint exact
costs.
In response to Commissioner Suffredin's question regarding the document on Abatement Activity
Duration, Mr. LaMont noted that every thing is premised on the County Board ' s permission to advertise
contracts in July because of the 3 to 4 month purchasing process prior to the County actually applying for
the permits. Mr. LaMont indicated that he did not believe informationa l hearings could be conducted
during this time period without holding up demolition plans because the Office of Capita l Planning and
Policy intended to request permission to advertise for the abatement and demolition at the July Board
meeting. T he next step would be to proceed to have the plans out for competitive bid since there are no
Board meetings planned for the summer and any action to have hearing would impact this timeline.
Michael LaMont commented that for historical purposes, consideration has always been given to
arc hitecturally sa lvaging certain hospital artifacts for historical purposes as reflected in the Demolition
Plan.
In response to Pres ident Stroger's comments, Commissioner Sims noted that the hospital co lumns on the
o ld building are crumbling and not as solid as they appear. The commissioner indicated that the architects
believe the figureheads on the buildings can be salvaged in addition to savi ng the hospital entrance and
making it a walk-through to the park as a way of saving part of the hospita l's history.

Chairman Butler declared that the next meeting of the Health and Hospitals Committee would be

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and Board of Commissioners

responsibility to administer for the City of Chicago.
Commissioner Silvestri applauds Pres ident Stroger and all of the members of the board for supporting the
resolution. Commissioner Silvestri stated that the resolution does not save or demolis h the structure, it
simply allows further opportunity for the possibility of saving the structure. He further noted that the
county should advertise for bids for the demolition for a couple of reasons: I) in fact the building will not
be saved in the long run the county will be informed; and 2) it also provides an opportunity for the Board
and the President to know how much the demolition will cost.
Commissioner Collins asked while waiting for the public hearings, will we be moving forward with the
resolution to demolish the other buildings that provide for the additional parking space that is needed.
Michael LaMont stated that the request of the Board is to allow the advertisement for bids of the
abatements and the demolition which includes all the buildings.
Commissioner Collins asked if the committee needs to come back and amend the resolution.
Michael LaMont stated that it should all be kept together.
President Stroger stated that Commissioner Goslin has had some experience with development demolition
and asked if we were on the right course.
Commissioner Goslin stated that he agrees with President Stroger that we are moving in right direction
and supports the bid process.
Commissioner Quigley stated that the county owes it to the people to hear them out.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY I , 2003

Commissioner Daley stated that he would like to congratulate Pres ident Stroger and the Commissioners
for bring ing forward this issue. He stated that the public hearings would be in the best interest of the
people of this county and would urge working with the consultant and looking at what the consultant has
brought to the attention of the commissioners.
Commissioner Peraica stated that saving the o ld hospital is an important goal.
President Stroger stated that the county should have the environmenta l engineers give the presentation
that they made to the committee so that everyone will have the opportunity to ask them questions.
Commissioner Sims commented that Pres ident Stroger is correct that we have the environmental
engineers give a presentation so that everyone gets a full understanding of what is going on with the
hospita l demolition and the environmental issues that the county has to deal with demo lishing or keeping
the o ld hospital.
Commissioner Steele asked if the consultant who did the ground work in terms of evaluating the hospita l
for demolition would be able to make the presentation to potential developers.
C hairman Butler stated that he is willing to have developers or consultants do whatever they are willing to
pay for. He further stated that every day we de lay demo lition it would cost us more money.
Commissioner Daley stated that if consultants start coming in that the developers would be relying solely
on the developer's consultant hired by the county. He also stated that he believes that we need the
developers to come in with the ir own consultants as well.
Commissioner Suffredin suggested that the committee should try to put together w ith the President a
resolution for the procedure on how the developers can see the building and pass it at the Board meeting
of July 1, 2003.
President Stroger stated that the committee gets a presentation from the individ uals the county paid to do
the study. He stated that the presentation would not only be helpful to the commissioners, but to
individuals who have shown some des ire. President Stroger stated that there are things that some of the
developers don ' t know that the commissioners are in possess ion of informat ion provided by eng ineers
working on the projects to make the recommendation to the committee on w hat approac h should be taken
in demolishing the building. Further, President Stroger asked them to pass out the summary that the
commissioners rece ived; a lot of work was done to prepare the summary.
President Stroger stated that the first thing that should be done is have a presentation and let individua ls
ask questions of the eng ineers as it relates to the report that was distributed to the commissioners. When
comp leted that information sho uld be passed on to people who would like to come in and discuss projects
that are available. Also what must be taken into cons ideration is the law as it exists now as we ll as the
report and that will cut down on further discussion.
Comm issioner Hansen stated that the commissioners should be looking at the possibility of saving verses
not sav ing. He also stated that the Board should go into the public hearings w ith an open mind and listen
to other suggestions, not just o ur own consultants.
President Stroger stated that the county could have built a hospital for $ 125 million, a teaching hospital
w ith 1,000 beds. He stated that the issue is not just a building, but that we have spent over $200 million
dollars just to keep the doors open. In conc lus ion I ask the commissioners to look at the reports that our
engineers have prepared; a new hospital was built and now more space is needed.

RESOLUTION
Sponsored by
THE HONORABLE PETER N. SILVESTRI AND LARRY SUFFREDIN
COUNTY COMMISSIONERS
Co-Sponsored by
THE HONORABLE MIKE QUIGLEY AND JOAN PATRICIA MURPHY
COUNTY COMMISSIONERS
WHEREAS, the decision to demo lish Cook County Hospital was made in 1999 based on a 1988 study
and a limited examination of space alternatives to meet zoning requirements; and
WHEREAS, that decision was based primarily on a 1988 study that focused on the rehabilitation and
reuse of the structure for the purposes of a hospital or for educational and offices uses for the hospital;
and
WHEREAS, in 1988 there was not a significant track record of redevelopment of buildings of this size,
and since that time, great strides have been made in the rehabilitation/reuse of large historic structures,
such as Medinah Temple, the Re liance Building, the Montgomery Ward Warehouse, Chicago's Theatre
District, and the Milwaukee County Hospital; and
WHEREAS, federal and loca l tax credits and incentives of more than $20 million are in place now that
did not exist when the study was done, drastically improving the economic feasibility of such a project
that can have mixed uses, including medical offices, clinic space, medical conference space, retail for
medical staff and the community and residential units; and
WHEREAS, Cook County Hospital is significant both as one of the c ity's best examples of Beaux Artssty le architecture and for its national historic significance treating the indigent and developing innovative
treatments for such things as bums and sickle cell anemia; and
W HEREAS, every new citizen group of Cook County was treated with dignity and medical experti se at
Cook County Hospital from 1914 to 2003; and
W HEREAS, in part because of its architectural and historic significance, Cook County Hospital was
chosen to be the model for the television series " ER", and the facrade of the hospita l has since become a
symbol of Chicago recognized around the world; and
WHEREAS, in addition to historic and architectural benefits, preservation of such structures serves as an
economic catalyst to the area; and

2076

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY I, 2003

WHEREAS, redeveloping the main hospital site exc luding the Children 's Hospital, power plant, 12KV
Building and other additions would put the two-block-long property on the tax rol ls and meet a ll required
zoning; and
WHEREAS, much of the "demolition preparation contract" (approved 8/ 1/02) focused on planning
efforts, including building documentation, utility relocation plans, and asbestos and other environmental
removal, initiatives that would have to be done regardless of whether the building is demolished or
reused; and

WHEREAS, a contract for the actual demolition has not been proposed, reviewed or approved; and
WHEREAS, actual demolition will cost the County from $20-$30 million and the actual tax credits a
developer could pay the County are in excess of $20 million, in addition to future real estate tax revenues;
and
WHEREAS, demolition and creation of another passive park, similar to Pasteur Park will have no direct
community benefits; and
WHEREAS, a reuse of the building has many direct community benefits; and
WHEREAS, a lthough the discussion to cons ider demo lishment of the hospital goes back as far as 1988,
the demolition or preservation of the structure w ill be a major decision of this Board of Commissioners,
many of whom have little to no information about the project.

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Pres ident and Board of Commissioners of Cook
County hold a hearing to discuss the demolition or reuse of the hospital and to consider the cost savings
that could result from the main hospital building' s reuse, in who le or in part without any financial
contribution from the County of Cook, prior to proceeding with a demolition contract.
Approved and adopted this lst day of July 2003.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 1, 2003

Chairman Quigley stated that he received a letter from County Clerk David Orr supporting the ordinance
and it should be made part of the record. (The referenced document is on file in the Office of the County
Clerk.)
In response to Commissioner Daley's question regarding whether the registration would take place in the
County Building or would it also be available in the satellite office' s, Brandon Neese responded that it
would start in the downtown office and over a period of time expand to the satellite offices.
In response to Chairman Quigley's question regarding whether the $30.00 filing fee would cover the cost,
Brandon Neese responded in the affirmative.
Chairman Quigley asked ifthe C lerk 's Office would need additional personnel or an increased budget to
administer this ordinance.
Mr. Neese stated the no new personnel would be hired and no increase in budget appropriation was
needed.
Brandon Neese stated that the fees would more than cover the ancillary costs.
Chairman Quigley asked Helen Haynes, State's Attorney's Office to give a brief overview.
Helen Haynes advised Chairman Quigley that the State's Attorney 's Office had reviewed the ordinance
and determined that it was within Cook County Home Rule authority to adopt a Domestic Partnership
Registry Ordinance.
Commissioner Peraica asked why the definition of "Domestic Partnership" is limited to same sex partners
and he also asked what the constitutionality of the definition is since it is limited to same sex partners.
Helen Haynes stated that the definition was a policy decision and the rational was that a person of the
opposite sex has the legal option to marry.
Commissioner Peraica asked if in effect, it violates the federal defen se of marriage act.
Ms. Haynes stated that she needs to review the statute.
Commissioner Peraica stated that he was concerned the people would have a false sense of security.
Ms. Haynes responded that the ordinance does not extend benefits but that it is useful for employers to
provide benefits.
Commissioner Steele asked ifthere is dissolution of partnership and ifthere is a fee?
Brandon Neese stated that there is a process for disso lution, but no determination has been made as to the
cost. The County Clerk's Office would come before the County Board with a fee ordinance. He further
stated that the fee would be around $10.00 for dissolution.
Chairman Quigley stated that he had his staff distribute fact sheets to the commissioners.

right, we must find a system that gives all the same level of care. When you improve the health status of
