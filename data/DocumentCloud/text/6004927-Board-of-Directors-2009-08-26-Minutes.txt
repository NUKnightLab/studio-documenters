REPORT FROM THE SYSTEM
INTERIM CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER JOHN RABA, MD
•

Presentation on the System’s preparations for H1N1

Dr. Raba introduced Dr. Robert Weinstein, Chief Operating Officer of the Ruth M. Rothstein CORE Center of
Cook County, who presented a report on the System’s preparations for H1N1 (Swine Flu) (Attachment #2).
The Board reviewed and discussed the report. Dr. Linda Murray, Chief Medical Officer of the Cook County
Department of Public Health, provided information relating to the control, prioritization and distribution of the
vaccines.
Director Muñoz requested that the subject of preventative measures, including those that may boost immunity,
also be reviewed.
Director Ansell inquired whether there are plans to mandate flu shots for the System’s health care workers. Dr.
Weinstein stated that the Office of the State’s Attorney is currently researching this question. Elizabeth Reidy,
General Counsel for the Cook County Health and Hospitals System, provided additional information on the
subject. She stated that issuing a mandate appears possible, however this may need to be bargained for with the
unions.
Chairman Batts issued a statement on the subject, urging management and the medical staff to work with the
unions to get a mandatory flu vaccination program for the System’s health care workers in place.
Dr. Weinstein provided additional information. He stated that the vaccines will likely be available in October.
He added that in the past, they have not had vaccine shortages, but the question remaining has to do with timing
and flow. For protection against the H1N1 virus, there are three vaccines that need to be administered during a
six week time period – the H1N1 vaccine, a seasonal flu vaccine, and a booster for the H1N1 vaccine.

UPDATE ON FY2009 AND FY2010 PRELIMINARY BUDGET
ADOPTION AND IMPLEMENTATION
•

Review, discuss and approve proposed FY2010 Preliminary Budget for
the Cook County Health and Hospitals System (Attachment #5)

Mr. Foley provided an overview of the proposed FY2010 Preliminary Budget. He stated that included in the
information is a cover letter and a white paper on the methodology used to formulate the budget. Also included
is a draft Resolution relating to certain aspects of System budgetary control, which is expected to be introduced
to the County Board for their approval. The Board reviewed and discussed the information provided.
Dr. Anthony J. Tedeschi, Interim Chief Operating Officer of the Cook County Health and Hospitals System,
provided additional information. He noted that two particular issues impact the planning of the budget: the
budget directives, and the fact that the System is only partly through a strategic planning process that could
fundamentally change the System.
Given the inefficiencies and opportunities that have been identified in the workforce, Dr. Tedeschi stated that
they are planning to implement full-time equivalent employee (FTE) reductions for FY2010, totaling
approximately $60 million. The $60 million is made up of 883 vacant positions that were budgeted in FY2009.
They have eliminated 358 open positions. That leaves a total of 784 open positions; they will eliminate another
two-thirds of those. That will leave approximately 259 open positions to be filled, which will help in critical
areas. He added that they have put together a process
to manage the position control.
Page 14 of 95

 REPORT OF THE MEETING
OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE
COOK COUNTY HEALTH AND HOSPITALS SYSTEM
AUGUST 26, 2009
Page 15
With regard to filled positions, Dr. Tedeschi stated that there will be an elimination of 467 filled positions in
FY2010. This will happen in a two-phased approach. In the first phase, which will occur in the Fall, they will
focus on the positions that are straight-forward opportunities – areas in which workloads can be re-assigned and
changes can be made. The second phase consists of more complex opportunities – areas to reduce the
workforce that involve the re-design of processes and systems. That work will be done through the Fall and into
the Winter; those positions will be eliminated in the Spring.
Dr. Tedeschi provided additional information on FY2010 expense assumptions. He noted that there is an
additional $20 million expense reduction for continued improvement in managing the supply chain. This comes
through pricing, as well as working with the physicians on preference items. Additionally, there is $30 million
budgeted for operating expenses and $30 million budgeted for capital expenditures; these are placeholders for
when the strategic plan is finalized. The total capital request is approximately $66 million, $30 million of which
is reserved for the strategic plan.
Mr. Foley stated that the System will be holding its own budget hearings. Further information will be provided
after the dates are set. However, three of the four hearings will be held in the evening at the three hospitals, and
the fourth hearing will be held downtown in the County Board Room during the day.
Mr. Calkin presented detailed information on the methodology used to prepare the FY2010 Preliminary Budget.
The key point relates to the 19% reduction mandate given by the County’s Department of Budget and
Management. The interpretation of this mandate by the County’s Budget Department is that it is a 19%
reduction on FY2009 appropriated expenses; with this interpretation, a comparison of the System’s FY2009
appropriated expenses in the amount of $850 million would calculate to a reduction of expenses in the amount
of $160 million in FY2010. In contrast to the County Budget Department’s interpretation, Mr. Calkin stated that
this preliminary budget was prepared with the assumption that the 19% reduction mandate applies to the County
tax subsidy portion that the System received in FY2009. A 19% reduction of the County tax subsidy equals $74
million; this reduction is included in the FY 2010 Preliminary Budget.
During the discussion on personnel expenses, Chairman Batts inquired whether Cermak Health Services has
applied for reaccreditation. Dr. John M. Raba, Interim Chief Medical Officer of the Cook County Health and
Hospitals System, responded that they have initiated the process. With regard to setting a timetable, Dr. Michael
Puisis, Chief Operating Officer of Cermak Health Services, added that it would be unrealistic to set timeframes
without first implementing the electronic records system; their goal is to have this system implemented in six
months.
In response to Director Zopp’s question regarding an additional $37 million in expenses, Mr. Calkin stated that
the total includes the following expenses: purchase of the Lawson System; amending and increasing the
MedAssets contract, as a result of re-negotiating their fee from a contingency-based fee to a flat monthly fee,
and as it relates to Chamberlin Edmonds and their responsibility for all eligibility vendor efforts.
Chairman Batts requested that the budget pages be sorted by business unit and numbered. Mr. Foley requested
that a schedule be added relating to the additional $37 million in expenses.
Director Butler, seconded by Director Zopp, moved the approval of the FY2010 Preliminary Budget,
which includes the proposed Resolution and white paper, as amended. THE MOTION CARRIED
UNANIMOUSLY.

 CCHHS Board Presentation Preparation for H I N l
During the spring outbreak of H I N1 there were regular planning meetings with representation
from JHSH, Provident, Cermak, Core, ACHN, and OFH. Our future meetings will include
CCDPH. The next meeting is on August 27thwith representation from all of the above institutions

1. Surveillance
a. We have developed an electronic surveillance tool that was implemented
for the JHSH clinics and the emergency department; this should be able to
be used in most of the system
b. Infection control and employee health were notified in real time of every
positive HlNl isolate. An electronic tabulation of positive results is being
developed for the system
c. Triage personnel are being trained at JHSH and ACHN (clerks) to
recognize persons with influenza like illness. This training can be used
system wide
2. Pharmaceuticals
a. The pharmacy is equipped to report on stock of antiviral medications
system wide
b. An educational program for the administration of relenza (an antiviral
agent) is being developed
3. Vaccine
a. Pharmacy here will pre-register CCHHS for Hl Nlvaccine
b. Each facility must estimate the amount of vaccine needed for patients and
employees (it is estimated that we have 6889 employees system wide)
c. We are working with E. Reidy to help determine the feasibility of
mandating influenza vaccine for CCHHS
d. We need to plan for vaccine clinics throughout the system
e. There is work being done to establish a separate clinic at the Core Center
for HlNl vaccine for Core Center patients.
4. Personal protective equipment (PPE)
a. During the spring outbreak of HlNl we regularly took stock of PPE
throughout the system. This will again be reported at the August 27th
meeting to determine what needs to be purchased, how to protect and
distribute supplies throughout the system.
b. We will need to purchase supplies for which we currently do not have a
contract, such as table top containers of hand sanitizer. It is my hope that
the group purchasing system will be in place.
5. Infection Control
a. The hospital epidemiologists communicate regularly throughout the
system
b. We follow local, state and/or federal recommendations to the extent that
they apply to our facilities
6. Employee Health
a. A post exposure prophylaxis plan is being developed that should be able to
be used system wide
b. An electronic data base is essential for employees system wide

Page 22 of 95

 7. Education
a. We have an HlNl site on the Department of Medicine Website
b. We have updated our annual infection control education electronic module
to include HlNl and seasonal flu; this is available to be used by others in
the system
c. We will post information throughout the hospital as was done in the
spring (this information will all be on the website and available to
everyone in the system)
d. We have recommended that every employee have an e-mail account so
that they can be updated regularly
e. Each institution should have a venue to disseminate information; at JHSH
we need to be able to have access to the auditorium which is currently not
available for use
8. Laboratory
a. The microbiology laboratory at JHSH processed approximately 900 viral
specimens in the spring. They have requested, in their budget, to purchase
equipment that will allow them to rapidly diagnose influenza and identify
the specific type of influenza. It is the hope of the laboratory director that
specimens throughout the system, from patients and healthcare workers,
can be processed at JHSH laboratory
9. Human resources
a. Planning for loss of staff due to illness, or due to staff caring for ill
persons at home yet needs to be done system wide
10. Surge capacity
a. This has been evaluated for the system in the past and will be revisited

Dear Ms. Duffy,
Three proposals were submitted for Prescription Claims Processing Services (RFP#08-502019P)
by ESI, Ready Made Staffing and SAV-RX. Attached is a matrix scoring the three companies
according to the requirements within the RFP.
The company with highest cumulative points was ESI. This company is the current billing vendor
and is fully capable of handling all the requirements of the RFP. The SAV-RX proposal claimed
the ability to comply with all requirements, but did not indicate how it would be accomplished.
An on-site presentation of the SAV-RX solution was requested. SAV-RX provided a flow
diagram detailing their electronic claims system. The diagram included three main components:
1) electronic submission of raw claim 2) receipt of raw claim into SQL database for scrubbing of
data, eligibility checking and proper routing and 3) claims adjudication. However, it was
determined that SAV-RX did not have a current customer utilizing the proposed billing flow. In
addition, there was no working model of the solution presented. Further more, the second
component (SQL database) mentioned above, would have to be developed and tested. Therefore,
SAV-RX was not recommended as a qualified proposer. The proposal by Ready Made Staffing, a
staffing company was also reviewed. Ready Made Staffing proposed placing 15-20 people in an
office to process the claims. The proposal specifications called for an electronic system for the
processing of claims. Pharmacy claims are normally processed electronically throughout the
industry with minimal human intervention. This allows for the immediate adjudication of claims
and real-time co-pay information returned to the pharmacy during the prescription filling and
dispensing process. Ready Made Staffing did not meet any requirements requested in the
proposal. Also, Ready Made Staffing did not submit the requested references for pharmacy claim
adjudication services. All references provided referred to companies using Ready Made for
staffing purposes.
Therefore, based on a review of the information provided, we are recommending that ESI be
awarded the proposal.
Your assistance with this matter is appreciated.
Sincerely

-w

Re: Contract No. 09-53-132

Dear Ms. Triche-Colvin
We have reviewed the bid tabulations for the above referenced contract and recommend award to the lowest qualified
bidder meeting the specifications, Dayspring Incorporated in the amount of $847,536.00.
The first apparent low bidders T.L.C Janitorial Services and Executive Janitorial Services were found non responsive to
paying all wages, health and welfare, and fringe benefits as set forth in the Builders Owners & Managers Association, as
called for in the specifications and required by the Purchasing Ordinance.
The third apparent low bidder Folashade's Cleaning Services did not submit proof of Health Care Janitorial experience
and a staffing plan has outline in the first paragraph of the cleaning specifications and does not have experience with
Health Care accrediting organizations.
The Fourth apparent low bidder Uni-Max Management Corporation does not have the Health Care experience required
per the contract cleaning specifications and consequently no experience with Health Care Accrediting Organizations.
The Fifth apparent low bidder Dust Em Clean Maintenance provided us with a Health Care reference call Advance
Occupational Medicine Specialist. When we contacted the Executive Director of the Organization (Johanna Anderson)
she told us that Dust Em has only been servicing her facility for a month and that they are not satisfied with their team a
month into the agreement.

The Honorable President and Members
Cook County Board of Commissioners
County Building
118 N. Clark, Room 567
Chicago, Illinois 60602
Dear President and Commissioners:

In presenting to you the proposed FY 2010 Budget, we would like to remind you that this budget
is in keeping with the County Department of Budget & Management Services guidelines of a
19% reduction from the Appropriated FY 2009 Budget. The approach that we took with this
guideline of the 19% reduction was against the Tax Subsidy - the money that we get from the
County in taxes - rather than the appropriated expense amount. The reason for this approach is
that this will give us credit for the additional $100M+ in revenues that are projected for the
System in FY 2010 due to the DSH payments.
The proposed FY 2010 Budget also includes three other very important additional items:

- We have included $30M in Operational Expenses and $30M in Capital for the Three
Year Strategic Plan, which is to be delivered to you in November.
-

We have included in the Operational Expenses the projected opportunities that the
Navigant Consulting Group has identified .as well as the elimination of 500+ vacant
positions. The total reductions for these two steps are in excess of $80M.

- We have included a resolution that will streamline our processes as well as make our
Capital Acquisitions less cumbersome and allow operations not to be hampered like it
was in FY 2009.
The FY 2010 Budget is a continuation of the efficiencies, operational improvements and better
services that began with the FY 2009 Budget. The goal was to end FY 2009 with five substantial
changes in place and they are as follows:
1.

A first class executive team strong enough to implement the necessary changes in
their area of responsibility.

2.

A fully functional IT system in the areas of Finance, Human Resources and Contract
Procurement capable of delivering accurate financial and operational information on
a timely basis, with sufficient well-trained staff to support those systems.
The Lawson conversion began last month and the General Ledger should
be operational by March 20 10.

3.

A comprehensive procurement function, staffed with experienced procurement and
contracting personnel.
On August 1, the System assumed all purchasing functions from County
Purchasing and the Group Purchasing Organization and Prime Vendor
operations should be operational by September 2009.

4.

A net reduction of at least 464 positions.
The total of eliminated and identified open FY09 budgeted positions is
883.
o FY 2009 goal was a net 464
o Accomplished to date in FY 2009 358 vacant positions have
been eliminated
o By the end of FY 2009 an additional 500+ vacant positions will
be eliminated
o An additional 4.67 filled positions will be eliminated in two
phases during the fall and spring that were identified by
Navigant Consulting.

5.

Identify additional opportunities to improve services and reduce costs.
The Office of Performance Improvement was established. Navigant
Consulting conducting performance improvement assessment to be
completed by 913012009.

In addition, the FY 2010 budget addresses the restoration of screening mammographies and
elimination of colonoscopy backlog; includes a new time & attendance system; funds the
stroke and SBRIT programs; and designates the system campuses smoke free.

Page 77 of 95

 The FY 2009 budget is on target or better than the final appropriation. The FY 2010
preliminary budget meets the requested 19% reduction from the prior year budget and
reduces the local tax revenue subsidy. It is also a bridge to the strategic plan, which will
allow the Health System to meet current .and future standards and expectations for the
delivery of quality patient care and more successfully meet the fiscal and strategic challenges
in front of it.

Sincerely,

/

 COOK COUNTY HEALTH & HOSPITALS SYSTEM WHITE PAPER
PROPOSAL ON THE USE OF FEDERAL AND/OR STATE FUNDS RECEIVED
DURING FY09 AND UN-APPROPRIATED BY THE COOK COUNTY BOARD

Introduction
The Department of Budget & Management Services directed all Cook County agencies,
departments and elected officials to prepare the FY 2010 Budget Requests including
three potential budgeting scenarios: a budget equal to or less then the FY 2009
Operating Budget; a budget 12% less than FY 2009 in the event that the sales tax is
reduced by 1.25%; and a budget 19% less than FY 2009 if the sales tax is reduced by
1.25% g
n
J the 2007 Pension Obligation is to be paid out of the General Fund instead of
being funded through a bond issue. In complying with that directive the Cook County
Health & Hospitals System's FY 2010 budget approved by the System Board is 19%
less than the FY 2009 appropriation. This was achieved through the following "one time
contributions":
Federal Medical Assistance Percentages
Disproportionate Share Hospital Allocations

Short-term Funding Increases
Temporary Increase in Illinois' Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP)
According to formulas specified by ARRA, each state's Federal Medical Assistance
Percentage (FMAP) has been raised through December 2010. FMAP is the portion of
federal dollar matching participation in a state's Medicaid expenditures. For federal
fiscal year 2009, beginning October 2008, Illinois' matching percentage has been raised
by raised by ARRA from 50.32% to 60.5%.

'

Because Cook County finances its own Medicaid payments through intergovernmental
transfers, the county health system is able to realize directly .the benefits of the FMAP
increase. For the period October I,2008 through June, 2009, the FMAP benefit to Cook
County totaled $35.78 million. Going forward, the magnitude of the benefit depends
directly on levels of Medicaid utilization; The State Medicaid Agency (HFS) has
estimated the ARRA benefit to CCHHS at approximately $3 million per month through
June, 2010.
Temporary Increase in State Specific Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) Allocations
Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) adjustment payments provide additional funding
to states to help those hospitals that serve a significantly disproportionate number of
low-income patients; eligible hospitals are referred to as DSH hospitals. States have
available an annual federal DSH allotment that may be drawn down to defray the
FMAP for some categories of Medicaid expenditures, notably SCHlP program expenditures on
children's healthcare, was not raised by ARRA, because these expenditures already are matched
at an enhanced rate.

Page 90 of 95

 otherwise uncompensated costs of DSH hospitals. The terms of Illinois State Medicaid
Plan, as approved by the Illinois legislature and by federal authorities permits CCHHS to
be paid DSH monies, along with other specified beneficiaries.
The annual allotment is calculated by law and includes requirements to ensure that the
DSH payments to individual DSH hospitals are not higher than these actual
uncorr~pensatedcosts. ARRA increases in all states FFY 2009 and FFY 2010 DSH
Medicaid allotments by 2.5%; Illinois' DSH allocation for FFY2009 was raised by
approximately $5 million, and will be raised by approximately $6 million in FFY2010.
CCHHS has, and will going forward, realize a portion of DSH benefit under A R M .
Looking to FY 2010 in which the FMAP and DSH increases are in affect through
December 2010, the proposed budget for FY 2010 reflects an increase in revenue from
$468 Million to $579 Million. The proposed budget for FY 2010 reflects an increase in
expenses from $850 Million to $880 Million but reflects a reduction in the taxes needed
to cover the deficit from $382 Million to $301 Million, a savings over the requested 19%.
The stimulus money received by the Health System through the ARRA should be
considered "short-term" in nature and while contained within the FY2010 operating
budget, must be accounted for in future budget planning so as to deal with the resulting
shortfall in subsequent years.
Therefore having proposed an operating budget for FY2010 that is balanced with the
use of anticipated revenues generated and appropriated within FY2010, and having
done so while decreasing the local county tax revenue subsidy to the System, we would
now turn to the proposal for use of funds received during FY09 and un-appropriated by
the Cook County Board.
Underlying Principles contained within this proposal

The Cook County Board of Commissioners in creating the Ordinance Establishing the
Cook County Health and Hospitals System (Ordinance No. 08-0-35), specifically Section
38-80(g), transfers to the System Board the pawer and responsibility "to submit budgets
for the CCHHS operations and capital planning and development, which promote sound
financial management and assure the continued operation of the CCHHS, subject to the
approval of the County Board". The System Board believes that sound financial
management warrants the Health System adopting more fully, an "Enterprise Fund"
model to account for the financial operation of the Health System.
'The National Council on Governmental Accounting defines the purpose of enterprise
funds "...to account for operations (a) that are financed and operated in a manner similar
to private business enterprises - where the intent of the governing body is that the costs
(expenses, including depreciations) of providing goods or serves to the general public on
a continuing basis be financed or recovered primarily through users charges; or (b)
where the governing body has decided that periodic determination of revenues earned,
expenses incurred, and/or net income is appropriate for capital maintenance, public
policy, management control, accountability, or other purposes." The Health System's
activities meet the definition of an enterprise fund.

Page 91 of 95

 Generally accepted accounting principles require that state and local governments use
the enterprise fund model to account for "business-type activities" - activities similar to
those found in the private sector. Business-type activities include services primarily
funded through user charges. The Health System operates health care facilities similar
to companies in the private sector. Therefore the Health System's operations are
"business-type activities".
Section 29 of the Resolution Providing for the Annual Appropriation for the Fiscal Year
2009 (Resolution No. 09-R-109) states "For the Elected Officials, Heads of departments,
offices, institutions, or agencies of the County who increase revenue estimates for
purposes of avoiding decreases in appropriations to each budgetary unit or groups of
budgetary units and are found to have a shortfall of those estimates quarterly, the Chief
Financial Officer, the Comptroller, and the Director of Budget and Management Services
shall report the shortfall to the Board of Commissioners for an immediate amendatory
reduction in appropriation authority previously granted to the budgetary unit(s), of an
amount corresponding to the identified shortfall." The County Board through this section
of the budget resolution obligates that revenue estimates that are not met the budget
needs to be adjusted to compensate for the shortfall. In that vain it only seems
appropriate that the reverse is true as well, that if revenue estimates are exceeded the
budget needs to be adjusted to compensate for the profit. This is one of the key
underlying principles, specifically that the Health System Board operate with both the
authority and accountability to carry out the delivery of healthcare within the appropriated
budget.
Additionally, it must be remembered that these un-appropriated funds realized during
FY09 are in fact "one-time" dollars that will not be reoccurring. Again sound fiscal
management principles tell us that such one-time revenues should not be incorporated
within annual operating budgets so as to avoid causing built-in deficits for future years.
It is also key that the System Board propose financing plans that to the greatest extent
possible lower local tax dollar subsidy and other debt costs in the furtherance of the
Health System's operations.
Finally; under the various agreements and statutory language that have brought these
un-appropriated revenues to the Health System, the County is obligated to see that such
revenues are spent to further the provision of healthcare services to the specific county
resident population intended.
Therefore the System Board proposes to utilize these funds, in conjunction with the
Three Year Fiscal Plan through the following recommendations, so as to further the
mission goals of the Health System, lower the local tax burden on the residents of Cook
County, recognize the one-time nature of these funds and not create future funding
shortfalls, and operate in a responsible fashion that promotes sound fiscal management
and assures continued operations of the Health System.

 Summary of Recommendations
1. Bricks and mortar.
Many of the buildings and space within which current operations are conducted
have been, for a number of years recognized as in severe need of repair and/or
replacement. In many instances it can be found that conditions compromise the delivery
of safe, quality healthcare services to the current volume of patients, and as importantly
preclude any opportunity to increase access to services that are urgently needed by the
population served. Past County Facilities and Capital Planning documents list a number
of projects for replacement facilities for the Health System that have been put on
indefinite hold due to the lack of necessary funding. While the Health System is still
engaged in the development of a Strategic Plan, it can be said that major improvements
to the campuses will be called for.
As an example, the Fantus Building, which houses significant ambulatory operations on
the Stroger Hospital campus, has been on the list for replacement for a number of years.
This project, along with the replacement of the Administrative Building (which houses a
large volume of our medical staff departments and physician offices, has been tied to the
reuse of the old Cook County Hospital structure. Patient and staff safety, quality care
that meets current and future community standards, and the ability to provide for current
patient volume levels as well as anticipated increased demands can only be successfully
met with the urgent development of appropriate capital projects both on the Stroger
Hospital Campus and elsewhere throughout the Health System, for the provision of
modern, enviror~mentallyfriendly facilities. Another example of a vital and urgent need is
the completion of the Stroger Hospital garage expansion that has largely been on hold
for a number of years following the opening of the new hospital. Not being able to
provide for relatively easy access to on campus parking has continued to hurt the
campus both for the patients and public, as well as the staff who serve them.
With these types of priority needs, we would propose to designate approximately $65-70
million dollars for this purpose.
2. Capital equipment and technology infrastructure.

It can be seen in all of the healthcare industry literature and the stated healthcare reform
agenda of the current White House, that healthcare systems must be aggressive in
carryout strategies that will see a continuous condition of having state of the art medical
equipment and technologies on hand for the delivery of high quality care. Similarly the
healthcare systems are being challenged (with future Federal funding being placed at
risk) to build or acquire health information record infrastructure that will serve to increase
the quality of care across the entire system of care (including multiple community
providers) and lower the cost of that service delivery. While the Health System has been
working to meet these challenges, significant investment is urgently needed within these
areas.

 For example it is imperative that all of the Health System's operating units be able to
access and share health information, in real time, to safely and appropriately serve
patients. Additionally, we can no longer afford to have 10-20 year old medical
equipment still in use (as is the case with the single slice CT scanner at Oak Forest)
where necessary testing can not be handled and/or results of tests performed might not
be fully trustworthy. In this instance while the Health System will continue to work on the
possibility of gaining more Federal funding that might become available, it is proposed
that approximately $40 million dollars be designated for this purpose.
3. Human capital investment,

In all of the orgar~izationalliterature, it has been repeatedly discussed and accepted that
the greatest resource that an organization has is its Human Capital, its workforce. It is a
priority that the Health System maintain a staff that is the best trained and most highly
skilled possible. Unfortunately, our Health System has not been able to keep up with
best and standard practices of investing in programs that will assist staff in gaining and
maintaining necessary competencies, helping staff attend on-going professional
education needed for skills development and technical knowledge, and training staff in
new technologies that assure efficient work processes.
Additionally, with the "graying of the workforce", investment in the education and
development of the near future healthcare staff must be made, particularly within the
healthcare professions.
As such we would propose designating $20 million dollars in educational programming
that will lead to the development and retention of highly qualified staff across the Health
System.
4. Cash reserves.
Again it is in keeping with healthcare industry standards and sound fiscal management
principles that the Health System, begin to develop Cash Reserves as part of the fiscal
strategic plan of longer term fiscal stability and viability. In surveying many of the larger
public healthcare systems across the country, the creation of Cash reserves has been
seen as vital and necessary. Most Rating Agencies would look for a fiscally sound
healthcare enterprise to have appropriate Cash Reserves on hand. Moody's U.S. Public
Finance Division provides ,their credit rating methodology for Not-for-Profit Hospitals and
Health Systems. The ratings criteria for days cash on hand at rating levels of Aa, A,
Baa, and Below Investment Grade are as follows:
Aa: More than 175 days cash on hand
A: Between 125and200dayscashonhand
Baa: Between 50and125dayscashon hand
Below Investment Grade: Less than 50 days cash on hand.*
Additionally, the creation of "rainy day funds" has been a common practice within local
governments for decades.

 As such, we would propose to designate the remainder of these un-appropriated funds,
approximately $30-35 million, as a very modest start at creating the kind of Cash
Reserves for the Health System that even in a down economy are viewed within the
industry as essential.
Conclusion

The Health System Board and its management believes that this proposal, in keeping
with the underlying principles articulated, represents a sound plan for the use of these
un-appropriated funds, that is consistent with healthcare industry standards and
practices for good fiscal management, will put the Health System in the best position to
meet current and future standards and expectations for the delivery of quality patient
care, and allows for the Health System to more successfully meet the fiscal and strategic
challenges in front of it.
In summary the CCHHS Board respecffully recommends that the un-appropriated funds
(approximately $163M) from DSH and FMAP programs be designated for use by the
Health System as follows:
$70M
$40M
$20M
$33M

Brick and Mortar facilities improvements
Capital Equipment and technology infrastructure
Human Capital Investment
Cash Reserves

$163M
