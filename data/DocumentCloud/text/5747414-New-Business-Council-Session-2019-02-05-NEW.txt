BY COUNCIL PRESIDENT BRO TEMPORE MARY SHEFFIELD AND COUNCIL
MEMBER RAQUEL CASTANEDA-LOPEZ:

RESOLUTION ENCOURAGING AN ONGOING COOPERATIVE RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND CUBA

WHEREAS, In 1960, the United States government imposed an economic, commercial, and ?nancial
embargo against Caribbean island nation of Cuba; and

WHEREAS, On December 17, 2014, US. President Barack Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro
agreed to reestablish diplomatic relations between the two nations; and

WHEREAS, Despite executive actions by President Obama easing certain regulations, the US.
embargo remains in place, as are restrictions on travel by US. citizens to Cuba; and

WHEREAS, The casing of international relations and trade between the United States and Cuba
bene?t both countries, particularly in the areas of food production, education, healthcare, tourism, the
arts, music, and biotechnological and medical research; and

WHEREAS, An end to the embargo would enable not only renewed diplomatic relations allowing for
a dialog on human rights, direct travel for the citizens of both countries, direct mail services, but also a
signi?cant expansion of international trade; and

WHEREAS, Normalization of relations with Cuba would greatly bene?t Michigan?s economy
including, but not limited to, increased trade opportunities with our automotive industry and
agricultural imports and exports. According to a June 17, 2017 report by Michigan Radio, Michigan
bean growers speci?cally expressed optimism about the opening of a new trade market. In 2015,
Senator Debbie Stabenow joined a bipartisan group of senators in introducing legislation to end the
embargo, following her second of?cial trip to Cuba; and

WHEREAS, However, in September 2017, without any precipitating hostile events, President Trump
ordered all diplomatic staff withdrawn from the US. Embassy in Havana and expelled diplomatic staff
from the Cuban Embassy in Washington, DC, signaling a pause, if not the end of normalization
efforts between the countries. NOW, THEREFORE BE IT

RESOLVED, That the Detroit City Council urges President Donald Trump to renew negotiations with
the Cuban government as initiated by the policy of past administrations to build a new, cooperative
relationship between the United States and Cuba and to reestablish the diplomatic staf?ng in the US.
Embassy in Havana and enable reinstatement of diplomatic staff at the Cuban Embassy in Washington,
AND BE IT FURTHER

RESOLVED, The Detroit City Council urges Congress and the President to immediately end all

aspects of the United States? economic, commercial, and ?nancial embargo against Cuba, including
restrictions on travel to Cuba by US. citizens. Venceremos. AND BE IT FINALLY

RESOLVED, That the Detroit City Clerk transmit a copy of this resolution to the President of the
United States, the members of the Michigan Congressional Delegation, and Mayor Mike Duggan.
