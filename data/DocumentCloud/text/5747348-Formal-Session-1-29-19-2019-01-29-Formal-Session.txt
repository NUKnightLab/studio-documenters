January 17, 2019
HONORABLE CITY COUNCIL
RE: Request of Mr. Matt Ward, owner of Lasher Tire Inc., (now Detroit Tire Wheels) to amend
Article XVII, District Map No. 73 of the 1984 Detroit City Code, Chapter 61, Zoning, by
rezoning properties generally bounded by W. Grand River Avenue, Cooley Avenue and

Redford Avenue from the current B3 (Shopping District) zoning classi?cation to a B4
(General Business District) zoning classi?cation. (RECOMMEND APPROVAL)

NATURE OF REQUEST AND PROJECT PROPOSAL

The City Flaming Commission (CPC) has completed its review and deliberations on the request of
Mr. Matt Ward, owner of Lasher Tire Inc., (now Detroit Tire Wheels). This report and
recommendation is submitted in response to the request to show a B4 (General Business District)
zoning classi?cation where a B3 (Shopping District) zoning classi?cation, currently exists on seven
(7) parcels commonly identi?ed as 22100, 22116, 22120, 22124, 22132, 22200, and 22250 W. Grand
River Avenue, generally bounded by the southeast-northwest alley ?rst north of W. Grand River
Avenue to the north, Lasher Road to the southeast, W. Grand River Avenue to the south and Cooley
Avenue to the northwest.

BACKGROUND

The subject properties are located in City Council District 1 and include a number of parcels and
structures under varied ownership. The tire sales and service facility is located at the corner of W.
Grand River and Redford at 2100 W. Grand River Avenue and occupies a former Comerica Bank
building. Abutting the tire sales and service facility is a former dentist of?ce (Family Dentistry, now
located at W. Grand River and Telegraph Road). The next storefront to the west is maintained and
appears to be functioning in some capacity, but there is nothing indicating what that function may be.
The next storefront to the west is boarded up, but appears to be open to trespass. The remaining two
thirds of that segment of the frontage of W. Grand River Avenue contains a two story brick building
with a storefront and a vacant bowling alley to the rear of the lot.

The rest of the B3 zoning parcel runs northwesterly one lot short of the comer of W. Grand River
Avenue and Cooley Avenue, where the corner is zoned B4. It includes two separate structures, a
Family Dollar and a Wendy?s fast-food restaurant, both setback from W. Grand River Avenue by
parking lots. The Wendy?s parcel consists of split-zoning one half of the lot falling within the
western end of the subject B3 district and the other half, which contains the restaurant structure,
falling in the B4 district at Cooley.

Proposed Development

Page 1 of 3

Prior to operating out of the current site the petitioner ran a smaller tire retail operation across the
street at the northeast corner of Redford and Lahser on B4 zoned land.

The CPC previously considered and recommended approval of this rezoning request in 2013.
Since that time the petitioner and subsequently staff tried, unsuccessfully, to develop a proper
legal description of the property to be rezoned separating the Grand River frontage from the
parking lot to the rear. The matter fell through the cracks until the Flaming and Development
Department began its neighborhood planning study and shortly thereafter enforcement again
became a concern. CPC staff thought a unifying zoning scheme would be quickly forthcoming
from the planning study. While it has brought forward some of the property owners who did not
respond to previous outreach efforts in 2013, it has yet to produce a ?nal rezoning scheme
for the entire area. Of those property owners that came forward, one was the owner of the
parking lot to the north. They provided a survey that was used to develop the legal description
for the rezoning.

SURROUNDING LAND USE AND ZONING
The zoning classi?cations and land uses surrounding the subject area are as follows:

North: R1 and R2 - Single?family residential, B4 - vacant commercial, parking, of?ce
South: Rl- institutional (school and church), B3, B4, commercial retail and auto service
East: B3 and B4 commercial retail, entertainment; and R1 - residential beyond

West: B4 commercial retail, R1 single-family residential, vacant land

PUBLIC HEARING RESULTS
On June 21, 2018, the CPC held a public hearing on this request. There were no members of the
public in attendance to address the rezoning request.

The original public hearing was held in December of 201 3. No public testimony was rendered at
that time either.

MASTER PLAN CONFORMANCE

The subject property is located within the Redford Neighborhood of Sector 8 of the Detroit Master
Plan of Policies. The Future Land Use map designation is ?Mixed Town Center? for the subject area
in the Master Plan. The Flaming and Development Department previously indicated the request was
consistent with the Master Plan of Policies.

ANALYSIS

The existing B3 zoning district classi?cation was established to support the development of a
shopping node in this area as a part of the commercial corridor improvement program sponsored by
the city. Sadly, the pattem of development never really followed that direction. The character of
development on the subject site as well as the Grand River frontage on the opposing side of the street
and further west is of a general commercial nature.

review of the approval criteria in Section 61-3-80 ?nds the rezoning request to be compliant.
Of them the primary criterion invoked by this request is which deals the correction of an error or
the challenge of a changing condition, trend or fact. The petitioner?s property served this community
as a bank for many years. When it was no longer viable to continue that use the branch was closed
and the property placed on the market for purchase. The petitioner purchased the property and was
able to open and operate the automotive retail and service facilities for many years before being cited
by BSEED. The rezoning to B4 will allow the petitioner to become compliant.

Page 2 of 3

The past and present uses of the balance of the subject property to the west would also be allowed
under the B4 classi?cation. The rezoning will also provide continuity with adjacent and nearby
zoning across and to the west along Grand River.

RECOMMENDATION

The CPC having completed its review of this request recommends rezoning of the Grand River
Avenue frontage from B3 to B4. By doing so the entire block from Redford Avenue to Cooley
Avenue will be under the same zoning classi?cation. The marketability and viability of the
vacant properties will increase with expanding land use options available under the B4. The
petitioner will be in a position to pursue legal operation as a conditional under the B4.

On June 21, 2018 the City Planning Commission voted to recommend approval of the request of Mr.
Matt Ward. Consistent with the analysis and ?ndings provided above, the CPC recommends
approval of the request to show a B4 (General Business District) zoning classi?cation where a B3
(Shopping District) zoning classi?cation, currently exists on seven (7) parcels commonly identi?ed
as 22100, 22116, 22120, 22124, 22132, 22200, and 22250 W. Grand River Avenue, generally
bounded by the southeast?northwest alley ?rst north of W. Grand River Avenue to the north, Lasher
Road to the southeast, W. Grand River Avenue to the south and Cooley Avenue to the northwest.

NOTICE OF PUBLIC HEARING
A public hearing will be held by the Detroit City Flaming Commission in the Committee of the
Whole Room, 13th Floor, Coleman A. Young Municipal Center, 2 Woodward Avenue, Detroit,
Michigan 48226, on

THURSDAY. JUNE 2018 AT 6:00 PM

 

to reaf?rrn the Commission?s 2013 recommendation for approval of the request of Matt Ward
owner of Lahser Tire Inc., to amend Article XVII, District Map? 73 of the Detroit Zoning
Ordinance, Chapter 61 of the 1984 Detroit City Code, by rezoning properties Generally bounded
by Grand River Ave., Cooley, Willmarth, Lahser and Redford from the current B3 (Shopping
District) zoning classi?cation to a B4 (General Business District) zoning classi?cation. The
subject properties are more speci?cally known as 22100, 22116, 22120, 22124, 22132, 22200,
and 22250 W. Grand River Avenue.

The location of the proposed rezoning is speci?cally indicated as the shaded area on the
accompanying map.

The proposed map amendment is being requested to allow an existing automobile service facility
to operate legally within the subject area at 22100 Grand River. The proposed use would be
permitted on a by?right basis in the proposed B4 zoning classi?cation.

The pertinent zoning district classi?cations are described as follows:
B3- Shopping District

The district provides for a range of convenience and comparison shopping goods stores,
which are generally grouped into neighborhood and community shopping centers,
depending on the size of the area so mapped. Uses permitted are inclusive enough to
allow for the provisions of a broad range of goods and services for the consumer, and to
allow for as much freedom and healthy competition in the commercial real estate market
and commercial activities as is commensurate with other community values.

B4 General Business District

The B4 General Business District provides for business and commercial uses of a
thoroughfare-oriented nature. In addition to these uses, other businesses, which may bene?t
by drawing part of their clientele from passing traf?c are permitted. Additional uses, which
may be successfully blended with permitted by-right uses, are conditional.

A Zoning Ordinance map amendment requires approval of the City Council after a public hearing
and after receipt of a report and recommendation by the City Flaming Commission. This Zoning

Ordinance map amendment request is being considered consistent with the provisions of Article
111, Division 3 of Chapter 61 of the 1984 Detroit City Code, the Detroit Zoning Ordinance.

You may present your views on this proposal by attending this hearing, by authorizing others to
represent you, or by writing to this of?ce prior to the hearing; 2 Woodward Avenue, Room 208,
Detroit, Michigan 48226 (FAX: 313-224-4336). Because it is possible that some who are affected
by this proposal may not have been noti?ed, it is suggested that you kindly inform your neighbors
so that they too may express their positions if they so desire.

An interpreter for the hearing impaired or non-English speaking persons may be present at the
meeting if requested at least 48 hours in advance, excluding weekends and holidays. To request
that an interpreter be present at the meeti_ng. please call the Department ofCivii Rights. Inclusion

RE: Reaffirmation of recommendation for approval for the request of Matt Ward
owner of Lahser Tire Inc., to amend Article XVII, District Map No. 73 of the
Detroit Zoning Ordinance, Chapter 61 of the 1984 Detroit City Code, by
rezoning properties Generally bounded by W. Grand River Avenue, Cooley
Avenue and Redford Avenue from the current B3 (Shopping District) zoning
classi?cation to a B4 (General Business District) zoning classification.

DATE: June 19, 2018

In December of 2013 Your Honorable Body recommended approval of the request of Matt Ward
owner of Lahser Tire Inc., (now Detroit Tire Wheels) to amend Article XVII, District Map
No. 73 of the Detroit Zoning Ordinance, Chapter 61 of the 1984 Detroit City Code, by rezoning
properties generally bounded by W. Grand River Avenue, Cooley Avenue and Redford Avenue
from the current B3 (Shopping District) zoning classi?cation to a B4 (General Business District)
zoning classi?cation. The subject properties are more speci?cally known as 22100, 22116,
22120, 22124, 22132, 22200, and 22250 W. Grand River Avenue.

BACKGROUND AND PROPOSAL

 

The subject properties includes a number of parcels and structures under varied ownership. The
tire sales and service facility is located at the corner of W. Grand River and Redford and
occupies a former Comerica Bank building. Abutting the tire sales and service facility is a
former dentist of?ce (Family Dentistry, now located at W. Grand River and Telegraph Road).
The next storefront to the west is maintained and appears to be functioning in some capacity, but
there is nothing indicating what that function may be. The next storefront to the west is boarded
up, but appears to be open to trespass. The remaining two thirds of that segment of the frontage
is occupied by a two story brick building with a storefront along W. Grand River Avenue with a
vacant bowling alley to the rear of the lot.

The rest of the B3 zoning parcel runs northwesterly one lot short of the corner of W. Grand River
Avenue and Cooley Avenue, where the corner is zoned B4. It includes two separate structures, a
Family Dollar and a Wendy?s fast-food restaurant, both setback from W. Grand River Avenue by
parking lots. The Wendy?s parcel consists of split-zoning one half of the lot falling within the

western end of the subject B3 district with the other half, which contains the restaurant structure,
falling in the B4 district at Cooley.

Prior to operating out of the current site the petitioner ran a smaller tire retail operation across the
street at the northeast corner of Redford and Lahser on B4 zoned land

Your Honorable Body previously considered and recommended approval of this rezoning
request in 2013. Since that time the petitioner and subsequently staff tried, unsuccessfully, to
develop a proper legal description of the property to be rezoned separating the Grand River
frontage from the parking lot to the rear. The matter fell through the cracks until the Flaming
and Development Department began its neighborhood planning project and shortly thereafter
enforcement again became a concern. CPC staff thought a unifying zoning scheme may have
been quickly forthcoming from the planning project. While it has brought forward some of the
property owners who did not respond to previous outreach effort in 2013, it has yet to
produce a ?nal rezoning scheme for the entire area, which staff hoped could be combined with
your original rezoning request. Rather than delay any further staff and due to the amount of time
that has lapsed, staff is returning the matter before you for a second public hearing in order to
hear from the community and reaf?rm your recommendation. This will allow the petitioner?s
property and the related Grand River frontage to advance to the City Council. We anticipate a
larger rezoning for the land to the north and east beyond Lahser will come before the
Commission in the next six months to a year once the neighborhood planning project and/ or the
property owners/commuity produces such a scheme.

PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS

 

Surrounding Zoning and Land Use
The zoning classi?cations and land uses surrounding the subject area are as follows:

North: R1 and R2 - Single-family residential, B4 - vacant commercial, parking, of?ce
South: Rl- institutional (school and church), B3, B4, commercial retail and auto service
East: B3 and B4 - commercial retail, entertainment; and R1 - residential beyond

West: B4 commercial retail, R1 single-family residential, vacant land

Master Plan

The subject property is located within the Redford Neighborhood of Sector 8 of the Detroit
Master Plan of Policies. The Future Land Use map designated ?Mixed Town Center? for the
subject area in the Master Plan. The Planning and Development Department previously
indicated the request was consistent with the Master Plan.

Review

The existing B3 zoning district classi?cation was established to support the development of a
shopping node in this area. Sadly, the pattern of development never really followed that
direction. The character of development on the subject site as well as the Grand River ?ontage
on the opposing side of the street and further west is of a general commercial nature.

Staff review of the approval criteria in Section 61-3-80 ?nds the rezoning request to be
compliant. Of them the primary criterion invoked by this request is which deals the
correction of an error or the challenge of a changing condition, trend or fact. The petitioner?s
property served this community as a bank for many years. When it was no longer viable to
continue that use the branch was closed and the property placed on the market for purchase. The

petitioner purchased the property and was able to open and operate the automotive retail and
service facilities for many years before being cited by BSEED. The rezoning to B4 will allow the
petitioner to become compliant.

The past and present uses of the balance of the subject property to the west would also be
allowed under the B4 classi?cation. The rezoning will also provide continuity with adjacent and
nearby zoning across and the west along Grand River.

CONCLUSION AND RECOMENDATION

 

Staff having completed its review of this request recommends rezoning of the Grand River
Avenue frontage from B3 to B4. By doing so the entire block from Redford Avenue to Cooley
Avenue will be under the same zoning classi?cation. The marketability and viability of the
vacant properties will increase with expanding land use options available under the B4. The
petitioner will be in a position to pursue legal operation as a conditional under the B4.

Rezoning of the parking lot to B4 would likely have a detrimental impact on the adjacent
residential both in terms of the potential use of the land and related factor such as noise and
traf?c. A rezoning to P1 or may be more appropriate. Staff believes the remaining B3
zoned property should be reviewed within the larger context of the neighborhood planning study
and a rezoning scheme be develop for the greater including and surrounding the intersection of
Lahser and Grand River. Some text amendment may also be required.

RE: DEVELOPMENT INCENTIVES FLOW OF FUNDS
Please see the attached report in response to your request dated October 30, 2018.

This report addresses the requests and inquiries from the October memo, plus the additional
requests and inquiries made through further discussions that occurred between October 30th
and today.

The report defines the difference between Detroit Public Schools (DPS) and Detroit Public
Schools Community District and discusses both districts? obligations and their sources of
funding. Additionally, through collaboration with the Michigan Department of Education State
Aid and School Finance Division and the Michigan Department of Treasury, DEGC was able to
create a comprehensive understanding of the State?s role in funding the local school districts in
Detroit. Finally, the report uses an example project to show the effects of tax incentives in
development in the City of Detroit.

Should any additional questions come up, please do not hesitate to contact me personally.

RE: DEVELOPMENT INCENTIVES FLOW OF FUNDS

I am assigning LPD to work with DEGC to provide the report requested below.

Over the last four decades, the City of Detroit has approved numerous tax abatements and
development incentives. City Council on several instances has been questioned by the
community and Detroit Public Schools Community District on how these
incentives impact the ?nancial position of and Detroit Public Schools (DPS old).
A non-inclusive list of development incentives that capture these mileages are:

PA 376 of 1996 Renaissance Zone

PA 146 of 2000 OPRA

PA 210 of 2005 Commercial Rehabilitation
Etc.

99?59?

Staff has continued to indicate, as per state law, that and DPS are made whole
and not adversely impacted by the capture of operating and debt mileages. Despite these
assurances continues to express its concern about the ?nancial harm caused by
the capture of these mills. Please provide a chart that identi?es the ?ow of funds from
the capture of the mills at the municipal level to the reimbursement of lost mills to
at the state level. In addition, provide proof of reimbursement to and
DPS from all mills captured.

Please provide this response by 15 November 2018. If you have any questions please do
not hesitate to contact my of?ce at, 313?224-1198

Summary of Findings

I Under current law and the current per pupil foundation funding amount, no tax incentive
in the City of Detroit diminishes Detroit Public Schools Community District 
operating funds.

I Currently, tax incentives in the City of Detroit only affect the Detroit Public Schools (DPS)
local school district because it is the entity that is levying local property taxes, not 
Under current law no tax incentive reduces existing revenue for DPS.

II In the Ford Corktown Renaissance Zone, the reduced school operating millage levied by
DPS is fully reimbursed by the State Aid Fund on an annual basis.

Section I: The relationship between DPS, and the State of
Michigan

in 2016 the Michigan Legislature approved a restructuring] ofthe local school district in Detroit.
The bills split the school district into two entities: Detroit Public School (DPS) and Detroit Public
Schools Community District 

DPS, the pre-existing district, now exists specifically to retire operating and capital debt; the
funds for this come from levying property taxes. the new district, was established to
continue all rights, functions, and responsibilities of educating children in the City of Detroit, with
the exception of retiring old debt. Under this structure, does not levy taxes and receives
all of its operating funding from the State of Michigan?s School Aid Fund.2

property tax collection comes from two sources: "operating mills,? which are currently used
to pay off operating debt, and "debt mills,? which pay off capital debt.3 DPS will continue to levy
both. A June 2017 Legislative Policy Division (LPD) report estimated, based on current tax
collection, that the operating debt will likely be paid off within 10 years and that capital debt will
likely be paid off within 30 years. estimates came from a 2016 Legislative Analysis from the
Michigan House Fiscal Agency, which states that estimates for time until the debt is fully
repaid vary, it is likely to be at least 10 years.?4 An updated November 2018 report by the Detroit
Financial Review Commission (FRC) states that DPS is projected to pay off operating debt by
2027 and is projected to pay off remaining bonded debt by 2049. 5

DPS will cease to exist once it pays off all its operating and capital debt. Once the operating debt
is paid off by DPS, will then begin to levy operating mills as well as continue to be funded
through the School Aid Fund through the per pupil allowance formula. Any reduction in school

operating property taxes due to tax incentives is covered by the School Aid Fund, as was the case
prior to the 2016 entity split.

Section 2: Establishing local school district funding sources6

The State Aid Act (PA 94 of 1979) affirms that each school district in the state of Michigan is
guaranteed a per pupil foundation funding amount. 7 The act says that for the 2018?2019 school
year, the minimum foundation allowance is $7,871.8 The foundation allowance amounts are set
by the state legislature each year. The State Aid Act says that local school district funding is
determined by a per pupil allocation and then funded by a combination of local property taxes
and State Aid Fund contribution to meet that per pupil allocated amount.

The State Aid Act further requires that the State of Michigan meet shortfalls of property tax
collection in a given local school district. For which collects no local property taxes, this
means that the State of Michigan currently funds 100% of the district?s per pupil foundation
allowance through the State Aid Fund.

Although is the only school district fully funded by the state, many school districts in
Michigan heavily rely on the State Aid Fund to meet their foundation allocation. In 2017?2018,
every one of the 50 largest school districts in Michigan9 relies upon the State Aid Fund
contribution to meet their foundation allocation. As shown in Attachment D, none of these 50
local school districts contributes more than 45% of their foundation allocation through local
property taxes. In a scenario in which Detroit?s local school district had no debt, Detroit?s local
property tax contribution would be $65,641,205, about 18.43% of its total $356,243,351
foundation. Even in this no?debt scenario, Detroit would still rely on the State for over 80% of its

school foundation contribution.

Returning to the descriptive review of Detroit?s local public schools? funding, the State
of Michigan 2018?2019 State Aid Financial Status Report provides detailed reporting on the
State of Michigan?s funding allocation for each of the State?s Public School Districts. The most
recent report indicates that has a FY 2019 per pupil foundation allowance of $7,906.

In the 2017?2018 school year, received $478,292,931 in payments during that school
year, 21.7% more than its minimum foundation due to additional programs that provide state
support. 10 In 2018?2019, received a payment of $39,992,899.61 for its first payment of
the new school year in October and a payment of $48,254,351.82 in November.11

Section 3: Establishing the Roles and Effects of Tax Incentives

Tax incentives are used throughout Michigan and in Detroit to make developments that would
not otherwise occur financially feasible. Available programs in Michigan include:

I PA 198 of 1974, Industrial Facilities Exemption (IFE)
I PA 255 of 1978, Commercial Facilities Exemption (CRE)
I PA 147 of 1992, Neighborhood Enterprise Zone (NEZ)

I PA 376 of 1996, Michigan Renaissance Zone Act (Renaissance Zone)

I PA 328 of 1998, New Personal Property Exemption
I PA 146 of 2000, Obsolete Property Rehabilitation Act (OPRA)
I PA 210 of 2005, Commercial Rehabilitation Act (CRA)

The high?level effects of these programs on a local school district that levies property taxes are

summarized in Table 1.

Tax incentives do not cause DPS or to lose any existing tax collection. Rather, the tax

incentives lead to forgone future revenue over the incentive period. However, since these

projects would not occur without the tax incentive, this foregone revenue would not exist

without the tax incentive.

Because of the existence of two separate local school district entities in Detroit, the flow of funds
is different than all other school districts. in nearly all cases, the State Aid Fund fills gaps in the
per pupil allowance for the local school district that conducts day-to-day educational
responsibilities, and only to the extent that levied local taxes do not meet that operating
allowance. In other words, the state typically does not reimburse a local school district for debt

payment.

While all tax incentive programs ensure that no current revenue collection is lost, several tax
incentive statutes have special provisions that reduce the level of foregone revenue, or

reimburse forgone revenue to the school district through the state.

School revenue impacts related to Neighborhood Enterprise Zones

The Neighborhood Enterprise Zones (NEZ) are the most widely used tax incentive in Detroit
because they are the principal incentive for residential property. Because principal residences,
or "homesteads," are exempt from school operating millage under state law, an NEZ incentive
for a principal residence wouldn?t reduce the school operating millage because it is already
exempt. This holds true for all principal residences within Neighborhood Enterprise Zones.12

School revenue impacts related to Obsolete Property Rehabilitation Act

In most cases, the Obsolete Property Rehabilitation Act (OPRA) does not affect the amount of
school operating mills paid by the OPRA recipient. However, the statute includes a clause for a
potential 6-year, 50% exemption from the school operating millage. This clause is a "bonus" to
the standard OPRA incentive, which provides a 100% exemption for up to 12 years from the
school debt millage, and is applied during the first six years of the incentive period. Of all OPRA
applications statewide in a calendar year, only 25 are approved for this "bonus" exemption. For
these 25 projects, the State Aid Fund reimburses the school district for the full amount of the

operating millage exemption.

School revenue impacts related to Renaissance Zones
As ofJanuary 2019, there are 10 active Renaissance Zones or subzones in the City of Detroit. In

the case of Renaissance Zone, the statute states:

"Except as otherwise provided in subsection (6), this state shall reimburse local school
districts each year for all tax revenue lost as the result of the exemption of property

 

12 MCL 207.779 (11) For neighborhood enterprise zone taxes levied after 1993 for school operating purposes, the
amount that would otherwise be disbursed to a local school district shall be paid instead to the state treasury and
credited to the state school aid fund.

under this act from taxes levied under section 1211 of the revised school code, 1976 PA
451, MCL 380.1211, based on the property's taxable value in that year.?13

This means that DPS is reimbursed directly by the State Aid Fund for tax revenue lost under the
Renaissance Zone property tax exemption. The 2017-2018 State Aid Financial Status Report

indicates that DPS was paid $4,269,691.92 in that school year for Renaissance Zone allowance
(Attachment C).

This reimbursement differs from other tax incentives programs. While other programs are
reimbursed by a greater State contribution towards the local school district foundation, the
Renaissance Zone reimbursement is a direct cash flow to the local school district whose taxes are
being exempted.

 

13 PA 376 of 1996 MCL 125.26962 Sec. 12 (2)

Section 4: Ford Corktown Development school revenue impacts

Ford Motor Company announced in 2018 that they would be investing $738 million into a
development in the Corktown neighborhood of Detroit. The development would be anchored by
the rehabilitation ofthe long?vacant Michigan Central Station. Ford?s investment will have no
negative fiscal effect on foundation now or in the future. in fact, Ford?s investment will
have an significant positive impact on DPS property tax collection, therefore potentially
increasing the speed at which it can pay off its remaining debts.

Ford requested four different incentives to support this project: Obsolete Property Rehabilitation
Act, Commercial Rehabilitation Act, Neighborhood Enterprise Zone, and Renaissance Zone. The
Neighborhood Enterprise Zone is not yet final as the developer is still determining the viability of

building a residential component.

In the year before the Ford Corktown Development, the DPS operating millage collection from
subject properties was $10,824 and the DPS debt millage collection was $7,817.

First five years
During the first five years of the development, only the OPRA and CRA are reducing the taxes.
The estimated tax impacts are in Table 2:

Table 2: DPS Revenue impacts during initial period of Ford Corktown Development 

 

DPS Operating Millage DPS Debt Millage
Existing Revenue $54,120 $39,085
Revenue Gain $4,705,272 $3,398,252
Revenue Forgone ($1,508,400) ($3,280,433)
Net Revenue Impact $3,250,992 $156,904

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Next 30 Years

In Year 6 the Renaissance Zone will commence for the Ford Corktown Development.
Additionally, the OPRA will expire in Year 12 and the CRA will expire in Year 10. The estimated
tax impacts are reported in Table 3:

Table 3: DPS revenue impacts during 30-year Ford Corktown Renaissance Zone (Y5-Y35)

 

DPS Operating Millage DPS Debt Millage
Existing Revenue $324,720 $234,510
Revenue Gain* $59,086,844 $42,807,704
Revenue Forgone ($53,384,381) ($6,485,645)
State Reimbursement $53,384,381 $0
Net Revenue Impact $59,411,564 $36,556,569

*Includes a three-year phase-out at the end of the Renaissance Zone period, over which the tax exemption steps
down to 75%, 50%, and 25%.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In the first year following the end of the Renaissance Zone the estimated DPS Operating Millage
collection is $2,738,041 and the estimated DPS Debt Millage collection is $1,977,474. The two
figures below show the estimated net revenue impact to DPS during the existence ofthe

renaissance zone.

Ford?s investment in Corktown, and specifically its usage of the Renaissance Zone program
allows for a unique situation where revenue will substantially increase and a tax incentive
will exist. First and foremost, the Renaissance Zone does not exempt DPS debt millages, which
means that Ford will pay the 13.0 levy during the length of the project (after year 12 when the
OPRA expires). Additionally, due to the specific clause of the Renaissance Zone act mentioned
previously in this report, DPS will be reimbursed each yearfor taxes exempted by the
Renaissance Zone. An example of this is shown in Attachment C, where for the 2017?18 school
year, DPS was reimbursed $4,269,691 through the Renaissance Zone program. During years 5
through 35, Renaissance Zone reimbursement should increase each year due to Ford?s

Corktown investment.

RE: Community Planning Sessions

 

I appreciate your question regarding process for Inviting elected of?cials. community members

We have launched a new process to ensure Council Members are aware in advance of events hosted
by the department. Effective Monday. August 6. each Council Member will receive an email indicating

upcoming PDD public meetings in hisfher district

This biweekly email will contain the subject. date. time and location of PUD-organized public meetings
scheduled for the coming four weeks. The email will also include contact names from P00 and the
Department of Neighborhoods to support follow-Up questions.

PDD uses an extensive process to help ensure community members are informed of public planning
meetings. Working with the Department of Neighborhoods. we distribute invitations by e-mail. paper
llyers. social media and through existing networks of neighborhood organizations (community
development organizations. block clubs, houses etc). We also welcome any
communication support ava?able through the Council Member?s office. To ensure broad and timely
noti?cation of our meetings. this communication process begins 3-4 weeks before a planned event.

Staff from multiple departments are involved in both preparation and often presentations at PDD public
meetings. City staff attendance at P00 public meetings results from this partnership process.

We welcome Council feedback on how we might line-tune PDD's public meeting communications to
better strengthen our important partnership in serving Detroit citizens. Please feel free to reach out
directly to me or Deputy Director Janet Attan'an with your thoughts and suggestions.
