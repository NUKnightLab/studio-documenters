DEBORAH SIMS, ROBERT B. STEELE and LARRY SUFFREDIN, County Commissioners
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, the United States Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Medicare
and Medicaid Services, under the previous Administration, issued rules to restrict Medicaid payments to
public providers and to disallow Medicaid payments for Graduate Medical Education and for hospital
outpatient services (the “Proposed Medicaid Rules”), thus reducing the amount of money that will flow
through the Medicaid system to health care providers, to the Cook County Health and Hospitals System
and across the country; and

655

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 18, 2009
WHEREAS, the United States Congress is on record in opposition to the Proposed Medicaid Rules; and
WHEREAS, United States Senator Richard J. Durbin took a leadership role by introducing an
amendment to Public Law 110-28, the “U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans’ Health, and Iraq Accountability
Act, 2007” (the “Durbin Amendment”), with such amendment serving to place a one-year moratorium on
the Proposed Medicaid Rules; and
WHEREAS, with the active support of the Illinois Congressional Delegation, the Durbin Amendment
was included in Public Law 110-28, the “U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans’ Health, and Iraq
Accountability Act, 2007” and signed into law by President Bush; and
WHEREAS, this moratorium has been continued by the United States Congress and expires on April 1,
2009; and
WHEREAS, the United States House of Representatives has acted to extend the moratorium in H.R. 1,
“The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act,” to June 30, 2009; however, the United States Senate
currently does not intend to include an extension of the moratorium in its version of this bill; and
WHEREAS, the Proposed Medicaid Rules would reduce Medicaid payments to Cook County hospitals,
affecting not only Cook County and its most vulnerable citizens, but the entire public and private safetynet health care system in Cook County and in the State of Illinois.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners opposes the
Proposed Medicaid Rules and recognizes their potential impact on the Cook County public health system
as well as the overall health care system in the state of Illinois; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners hereby calls upon the
Illinois Congressional Delegation, in conjunction with the entire United States Congress, to continue its
opposition to the Proposed Medicaid Rules; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners urge the United States
Senate and the United States House of Representatives, in its conference on the economic recovery
legislation, to accept the House provision extending the moratorium through June 30, 2009 and calls on
the new Administration and the United States Department of Health and Human Services to dispose of
these pending regulations prior to June 30, 2009; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners recognizes the
invaluable leadership of Senator Richard J. Durbin and the Illinois Congressional Delegation in ensuring
that the Bush Administration’s effort to unfairly cut payments to public hospitals and other providers
throughout the nation is halted; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that we ask for your continued leadership to ensure that the Proposed
Medicaid Rules are disposed of by the new Administration; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Secretary of the Board is directed to deliver a suitable copy of
this Resolution to each member of the Illinois Congressional Delegation.

Proposed Resolution sponsored by Elizabeth “Liz” Doody Gorman, County
Commissioner.
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
A RESOLUTION CONSOLIDATING VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL
OPERATIONS BY COMBINING THE OFFICE OF CONTRACT COMPLIANCE
WITH THE OFFICE OF THE PURCHASING AGENT

718

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 18, 2009
WHEREAS, in an effort to help resolve the FY 2008 budget crisis, a resolution
consolidating certain government operations was introduced at the February 20, 2008
meeting of the Cook County Board of Commissioners; and
WHEREAS, during these tough economic times, the need to streamline County
operations still exists as the Board of Commissioners prepares to address the FY 2009
budget; and
WHEREAS, the Purchasing Agent is the chief County official with the charge of
procuring quality goods and services for Cook County agencies at the best market value,
making certain that vendors comply with all of the requirements of the Procurement and
Contracts Code and recommending to the County Board which vendors should be
awarded contracts based on their bids and on meeting all the required criteria; and
WHEREAS, one of the major criterion in determining which vendors should be awarded
contracts is compliance with the Minority and Women Owned Business Enterprises
division of the Procurement and Contracts Code; and
WHEREAS, compliance with the County’s MBE/WBE ordinance is the only criterion,
in the County’s contract procurement process, which is administered by a County
department other than the Office of the Purchasing Agent; and
WHEREAS, the Purchasing Agent should have the responsibility of making certain that
contracts are fulfilled appropriately and that vendors meet all of the requirements of the
Procurement and Contracts Code; and
WHEREAS, it is redundant to have two departments with such similar responsibilities;
and
WHEREAS, other large governmental bodies, such as the City of Chicago; Orange
County, California; Hennepin County, Minnesota, throughout the United States, have
only one department administering all of these functions; and
WHEREAS, it would be more cost efficient for the Office of Contract Compliance to be
merged into the Office of the Purchasing Agent.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Office of Contract Compliance is
hereby dissolved and the duties of said office shall be transferred to the Office of the
Purchasing Agent; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the employees of the Office of Contract
Compliance shall now report to the Purchasing Agent.
*Referred to the Committee on Contract Compliance on 12/03/08.
Chairman Maldonado delivered the following opening remarks:
Today we will consider a proposed ordinance sponsored by Commissioner Gorman which seeks to
eliminate the Office of Contract Compliance and transfer its duties and staff to the Office of the
Purchasing Agent.

719

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 18, 2009
The Committee selected today’s date as an accommodation to Commissioner Gorman’s request to hold
this hearing as early as possible from the date she introduced the ordinance but immediately after we
thought the Committee on Finance would take a vote on the 2009 budget. As you know, that vote took
place last night so we could not have guessed today’s date for this hearing any better than we did.
Nevertheless, Commissioner Gorman sent me a letter two days ago, requesting that the Committee
hearing be deferred because, and I quote, “It has been brought to my attention that there may be
investigations concerning certain contracts in the Contract Compliance Department.”
In speaking with the Inspector General about the allegation, Mr. Blanchard stated that the ordinance that
directs his role as Inspector General prohibits him from either acknowledging or denying the existence of
any investigation. However, he clearly stated that his Office had no objections to proceed with the
hearing.
Moreover, let it be clear that the Office of Contract Compliance does not award contracts. This is the
exclusive role of the Office of the Purchasing Agent. Therefore, the implication in Commissioner
Gorman’s letter that the Office of Contract Compliance is under investigation concerning certain
contracts it awarded is, at the very least, a misguided allegation.
Ultimately, I am convinced that the bonafide MBE/WBE community will welcome any investigation that
would eliminate any possible wrong doing that would hurt the viability of this essential program and
therefore the preservation of the minority business community of Cook County.
Yet, whether the Director of Contract Compliance, Ms. Betty Hancock-Perry, or the Inspector General,
Mr. Patrick Blanchard, wishes to make any statement about Commissioner Gorman’s allegation is up to
them.
However, as Chairman of this Committee, I will not allow the hearing to deviate from the subject matter
before us for consideration. That is, to deliberate on the elimination of the Office of Contract
Compliance. The MBE and WBE community deserves no less.
To that end, we have assembled a number of witnesses, all experts in this area, from whom we will hear
their perspectives on the proposed ordinance during the hearing. The Chair also extended the same
courtesy to the sponsor, Commissioner Gorman, to invite witnesses.
But before we start with the invited witnesses and the public, let me set forth the procedures I think we
should follow:
1.

We will hear from the sponsor of the Ordinance with her opening remarks and description of the
Ordinance.

2.

We will then hear from the Director of the Office of Contract Compliance, Betty Hancock–Perry
and her perspective.

3.

We will hear from the invited witnesses, allowing questions from the members.

4.

The Committee will debate.

5.

The public will testify.

6.

A vote will be taken.

The quantities as shown on the contract documents were estimated for bidding purposes only. This
change represents the difference between the estimated quantities and actual field quantities of work
performed with a substantial savings due to large reduction in quantity for expanded shale lightweight
