June 30, 2014

The Honorable John P. Daley
Chairman, Committee on Finance
Cook County Board of Commissioners
118 N. Clark Street, Room 567
Chicago, it. 60602

Dear Chairman Daley:

We are in receipt of your questiOns regarding the April 30. 2014 Revenue Report and following are
your questions and our responses.

1.

96% of the positive revenue variance is in the Health Fund, compared to 90% at the end of
February 2014. What is the sustainability of these positive variances for the rest of the fiscal
year?

The positive variances are not sustainable for the rest of the fiscal year. As stated in the
April revenue report, ?While this results in an apparent positive variance. revenue will have
to be committed to cover additional expenses related to higher than expected enrollment
and members outsourced to third-party medical providers. it is important to recognize that
significant expenditures are associated with these enroliees. in future months the variance
will look less favorable, particularly when reviewed in relationship to associated 
expenditures that are received after a multi?month lag. 

22% of the negative variances are in the Recorder?s Of?ce. The description explaining this
includes slow recovery in the housing market and rising property values. Economic forecasts do
not suggest this will change in the short term. If the Recorder's revenues have an unfavorable
variance of $4 million to date, this would project to a $10 million unfavorable variance at the end
of the year. What plans does the Recorder have to cut costs if revenues continue to fall below
forecasts?

The June 26, 2014 Preliminary Budget Forecast was announced last week. We believe the
Recorder?s revenue will and the year at $33.7 million. down from a budget of $41.5 million.
Similar to sales tax, this tax is an outcome of economic activity, and was set with the best
information available at the time of the budget. National GDP growth and economic activity has
been weak year to date, and this variance is a direct reflection of this trend. As a result. any
negative variance in this revenue line will have to roll into the mid-year County?wide course
correction announced with the preliminary budget. This is a revenue source that we will be
watching closely in the warmer, summer months to determine if there is increased activity and
evidence of an economic rebound.

The Clerk of the Circuit Court reports an unfavorable variance of $2.9 million, due to lower case
filings. The explanation points to a backlog in bulk case filings as a result of staff shortages.
Were temporary staff hired to address this backlog? Why are case filings down? What plans
does the Clerk have to cut costs in the face of continuing revenue shortfaEls?

According to the Clerk's Office, they used overtime to address the backlog and they do not

know why cases are declining. We have asked them to analyze this further. The Budget
Department will review workload and available resources as they review their 2015 budget.

The Honorable John P. Daley June, 30, 2014

The County has not received any funds from the IL Comptroller's Tax lntercept Program. Why
not? How much is currently in escrow waiting for distribution? When will revenue come to the
County through this program? With tax ?lings complete for 2014, it is unlikely the County will meet
its revenue target of $2 million by November 30, 2014. What will be done to reduce costs to
cover this shortfall?

We reached out to the Chief Financial Officer of the Clerk Circuit Court and their response follows:
Due to a technology issue, the Clerk of the Court was not able to separate out the revenue
collected from Tax lntercept from the rest of its revenue. in total, they collected over $700,000
from this program, but some of this revenue had to go back to the municipality in which the
citation was written.

Will patient fee revenue be capped when the CountyCare enrollment period ends June 30? If
so, it is critical that the population of enrollees' health be managed within the per member, per
month premiums received by Will the system break even after all costs are paid? Has an
analysis been done on the 128,000 enrollees to determine if this population can be served within
the limits of the revenue it generates?

We have reached out to the health system and asked them to respond directly to you.

Given the level of federal budget deficits. what is the possibility that Disproportionate Share
payments will continue?

Federal legislation delayed the implementation ofthe reduction of DSH payments to 2017.

Sales tax revenues are $2.1 million behind. This could result in a $5 million and of year
shortfall. Is there a revised estimate for annual sales tax revenue?

The June 26, 2014 Preliminary Budget Forecast includes our expectation to end the year with
$334 million in sales tax revenues, down from the $337 million budgeted This tax is an outcome
of economic activity, and was set with the best information available at the time of the budget. As
a result, any negative variance in this revenue line will have to roll into the mid-year County?wide
course correction announced with the preliminary budget.

With legislative changes to the pension system, will the County be required to increase the
amount of property tax revenue being dedicated to fund the pension system to reduce
unfunded liability?

The current status quo results in a significant 5 billion of unfunded pension liabilities in the
County and Forest Preserve Districts and actuarial projections that these funds will deplete all of
their assets in 20-25 years. The County remits the statutory maximum pension payment to the
Retirement Fund on an annual basis and has done so in the past; however, the payment is
insufficient to fund actuarial needs of the system. The legislation that would have reduced the
actuarial debt of the pension fund, House Bill 1154, was not adopted in the spring General
Assembly legislative session. However, under the presumption that any shared?sacri?ce model
would be adopted to eliminate the pension fund debt and reverse the current unsustainable trend,
the County will need to remit additional revenue to the Retirement Fund. The County will have to
identify a way to pay for the increased contribution, and the proposed legislation would have tread
the County to make annual payments from sources other than property taxes, which are currently
the only authorized sources of revenue understate law for County payments to the Retirement
Fund. The administration would look to savings opportunities prior to considering a tax increase.

Please let us know if you have any further questions.

Sincerely. .


Lawrence L. Wilson, Comptroller
