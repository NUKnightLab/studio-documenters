President; Co-Sponsored by John P. Daley, County Commissioner.
The following is a synopsis of the Proposed Ordinance:
PROPOSED ORDINANCE
The Cook County Predatory Lender Disinvestment Ordinance

WHEREAS, high cost lenders are preying on Cook County residents,
aggressively marketing high interest rate and high fee loans to residents of low
and moderate-income communities; and
WHEREAS, many of these predatory lenders are engaging in outright fraud
and deception in order to swindle people out of their homes; and
WHEREAS, some of the signs of a predatory lender include: a lender who has
a record of breaking federal and state laws; a lender who charges fees without
relation to the actual costs of services performed; a lender who charges fees
out of proportion to the standards of the industry; a lender who charges interest
rates substantially higher than those merited by the credit risk represented by
borrowers, and especially disproportionate rates to African Americans and
Latinos and other members of protected classes; a lender who originates loans
without regard for the borrowers actual ability to pay; or a lender who engages
in a pattern of fraud and misrepresentation of loan terms and costs; and
WHEREAS, these predatory lenders are stripping hard earned equity from
county residents and they are contributing to problems of vacant and
abandoned houses by making loans that families cannot repay.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED,
I.

11 .
Ill.
IV.

No bidding bank or savings and loan association maybe designated as a
county depository if it or any of its affiliates is a predatory lender.

and only 260 homeowners in framed homes; and

 FINANCE AGENDA
JANUARY 23, 2001
PAGE 43

WHEREAS, this concentration of mobile homes within School District 172 has
left the District with less money per pupil ; and
WHEREAS, counties within Illinois collect revenue from residents of mobile
homes under the Mobile Home Local Services Tax Act (35 ILCS 515/1 et seq.);
and
WHEREAS, the Mobile Home Local Services Tax Act does not apply to
counties with a population over 2,000,000 (35 ILCS 515/9.1 ); and
WHEREAS, areas with a high concentration of mobile homes will benefit from
an increase in local taxes provided for mobile homes in Cook County.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, AS FOLLOWS:

1.

From the date of adoption of this Resolution and until a review of
taxation of mobile homes, there shall be a moratorium on creating a new
mobile home park or expansion of an existing mobile home park within
Cook County.

2.

The County should examine following the tax established by the Mobile
Home Local Services Tax Act or creating a similar type of tax in order to
require all residents to pay for local services.
