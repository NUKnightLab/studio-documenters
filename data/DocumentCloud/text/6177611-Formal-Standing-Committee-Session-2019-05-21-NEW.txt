Capitol Park: Will serve as a summer oasis in the heart of the Central Business District. Complete with a bar run by Eatori (pending agreement and
MLCC approval), programming featuring surrounding and local businesses, games, and a variety of seating. We are also working on a potential coworking space in Capitol Park utilizing the greenhouses. These would be free and open to the public equipped with wifi, power, furniture, and
materials to encourage working together.
Cadillac Square: Featuring four outdoor basketball courts, sand volleyba!I. four square, soccer, dodgeball, and more, the Quicken Loans Sports Zone
is a hub for activity and play through sports, open to the public daily from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. all summer. Organized, pick-up games, tournaments,
birthday rentals, and sponsorship pop-ups offer fun at lunchtime and after work for sports enthusiasts.
Woodward Esplanade & Woodward Ave. & Capitol Park: Made Floral, Sweet Dreamz Creamery, and Delroit Kombucha Brewing Co. have been
working with students at the Brightmoor Makerspace at Detroit Community Schools to develop/build out industrial trikes into mobile business
vehicles for each of the participating Detroit-based small businesses. These are almost finished after a few delays, and we'd like to have them vend as
part of our summer activations. The trikes/carts will rotate between the Esplanade, Woodward Ave., and Capitol Park. We are working with DDP to
ensure that this doesn't interfere, but rather compliments their Downtown Street Eats Program.

category 8 (urban and suburban terrain) Mean recurrence interval of2.5 years.
Occupancy of the structures should not occur if measurable snow on the structures occur.
Temporary structure anchoring points shall be reviewed on a daily basis and reset as

Structural Certification Letter
Junior-T Orangerie Greenhouse
Manufactured by Janssens AluSystems In Belgium
Hollingsworth Pack has performed a structural analysis of the Junior-T Model Orangerle Greenhouse
to determine compliance with the International Building Code, which has been adopted by State
and Local governments across all U.S. States and Territories. The Junlor-T Model Orangerle Is a

'I

:I

I~ ,' / :; ~..) ; I

pre-fabricated aluminum greenhouse covered with 4mm thick tempered glass panels. A photograph
of the greenhouse can be found in the appendix of this letter.
Based upon our analysis, we have concluded that the greenhouse as currently Installed by Exaco
Trading Co. Is adequate to support the following loads per the 2015 Jnternatlonal Building Code:
Wind Load:

120 MPH (3-second gusts)

Snow load:

35 PSF ( ground-snow load)

Roof Live Load:

20 PSF

Our structural analysis and conclusions assume that the greenhouse is installed with a minimum
8"x16" tall concrete beam or sol Id-grouted masonry foundation continuous below the perimeter of
the greenhouse walls. The greenhouse should be anchored to the foundation with (8) mounting
brackets attached to the greenhouse frame, as specified in the "EOS Junlor-T Mounting
Instructions" document to resist overturning and uplilt wind forces.

If you have any questions regarding the matters addressed, or If additional Information ls requ"rred,
please do not hesitate to contact us. We appreciate the opportunity to be of service.

The QSC AcousticDesign™ AD-S12 is a
surface mounted low impedance, 12" twoway loudspeaker system, ideally suited for a
wide variety of foreground and background
sound reinforcement applications.
AcousticDesign™ series offers integrators a
premium quality installed sound solution
where performance, coverage, and
aesthetics are paramount Combined with
unprecedented ease-of-installation and high
weather resistance, the Acoustic Design TM
series provides integrators a versatile and
confident install solution.
The AD-S 12 features a high quality 1 2"
weather treated paper cone woofer on a
2.5" voice coil. A carefully selected 1" exit,
1.4" compression driver perfectly matches
the sensitivity and performance of the
woofer for outstanding full-range
reproduction.
Consistent and even 75° axisymmetric
(conical) coverage is achieved through
DMT™ (Directivity Matched Transition), a
QSC innovation which matches the
directivity patterns of the woofer and the
high-frequency waveguide at the crossover
point The result is a coherent transition
between transducers and improved off-axis
response.
With rugged ABS enclosures, sealed input
panel covers, and powder-coated aluminum
grilles for weather resistance, the
AcousticDesign TM surface mounted series
exceed IEC60529 IP-54 ratings for dusl and
splash resistance.

Installers will appreciate the award-winning
X-Mount™ system included with each fullrange AcousticDesign TM model. This
ingenious mounting solution achieves
unprecedented ease-of-installation in
horizontal, vertical, wall, or ceiling
deployments. Knurled surfaces at the pivot
planes ensure the load will not drift or sag
over time. Articulation marks allow
preconfiguration of the X-Mount™ while on
ths ground with no special tools required.
Once secure, the loudspeaker installs in
seconds, allowing the installer to work safer,
smarter, and faster with repeatable results.
The AD-S 12 also includes M 10 fittings for
optional yoke mount {YMS12) or shoulder
eybolt (M 1o Kit-C) accessories for
installation versatility.

To further enhance performance and speed
of install with optimum result, advanced
voicing filter sets using QSC Intrinsic
Correction TM techniques are obtainable
using O-Sys networked audio processing
platforms. including CXD amplifiers for a
complete QSC systems solution,
The AcousticDesign™ series feature a
stylish appearance free of obtrusive logo
adornments for aesthetically sensitive
installations. Acoustic Design TM surface
loudspeakers are available in OSC standard
black (RAL 9011) or white (RAL 901 O) and
may be painted to match any decor,
To assist in successful systems integration,
complete EASE, CAD, and BIM files are
available for online download at QSC.com.

 EXHIBIT A
SPECIAL EVENT AGREEMENT
TERMS AND CONDITIONS
Purpose and Term.
A. LN grants to Client the privilege and license to use the Space to present the Event during the hours provided above. Client
agrees to reimburse LN for any overtime wages, payments or other expenses incurred if the Event lasts longer than the agreed-upon
hours. Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by LN, Client shall not sell tickets to or promote the Event to the general public.
B. If a signed copy of this Agreement and the Deposit have not been received by LN prior to the date provided above, LN shall have
the right to contract with other parties for the use of the Space without further notice to Client.
2.
Financial Settlement.
A.Client agrees to pay to LN the costs and charges for all necessary staffing and operational services provided by LN in connection
with the Event, including, without limitation, catering, security, traffic control, entertainment, production, ushers, janitors and the room
rental fees.
B.Client agrees to spend at least the Revenue Guarantee on Event room rental fees, beverage, catering and production costs. This
minimum does not include any applicable taxes, administrative fee (fees for administrative overhead, documentation, preparations and
proper management of the Event; such administrative fee is not, nor is it intended to be, a service charge, tip or gratuity fo r wait staff,
service employees or service bartenders), retail, tickets, talent charges and any other charges set forth in the Special Event Order.
Such amount is the Revenue Guarantee and may not be reduced and is independent of the Final Guest Count or the actual guest count.
C.The Event Cost is an initial estimate of the total cost of the Event listed in the Special Event Order, which sets forth the menu,
accommodations and logistics for the Event in greater detail. The Special Event Order may be amended by the parties to reflect any
changes to the Event. For purposes of this Agreement, execution of an amended Special Event Order increasing total costs associated
with the Event will amend the Event Cost such that it matches the Event cost set forth in the revised Special Event Order. The Event
Cost and the amounts set forth in the Special Event Order are good faith estimates of the total cost of the Event. The actual cost for the
Event may increase based on Client's subsequent requirements or requests, and Client agrees to pay all such costs in excess of the
Event Cost.
D.
An Estimated Guest Count will be included on the first page of the Agreement. Client will provide a Final Guaranteed
Guest Count to LN no later than 11:00am seven (7) days prior to the Event ("Final Guaranteed Guest Count"). If the Event Cost is
based on a per guest charge, Client will be charged according to the Estimated Guest Count, the Final Guaranteed Guest Count or the
actual guest count, w hichever is greater. LN does not guarantee that it can accommodate food, beverages and other services for more
than five percent (5%) above the Estimated Guest Count.
E.The Deposit shall be paid as provided under "Additional Requirements" in this Agreement. The balance of the Event Cost is due
in a form of payment provided under "Additional Requirements" in this Agreement. All additional charges incurred for and/or during the
Event are due on the night of the Event, paid by cash or a valid major credit card. Personal checks are not accepted.
F.ln order to guarantee payment for balances due and any additional charges incurred during and/or for the Event, a credit card
authorization form, attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference as Exhibit B, must be completed, signed and returned with
this Agreement. The completed credit card form authorizes LN to process any and all outstanding balances due, including liquidated
damages. Client's execution of this Agreement and the attached credit card authorization form authorizes LN to process charges set
forth above against the credit card without further notice to Client. If any payment is not received by LN when due, LN may terminate
the Agreement and retain the Deposit. The Deposit is refundable only In the event of a Force Majeure Occurrence as provided in
Section 16.G below.
G.
The parties acknowledge that it would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to determine with certainty the damages
which LN would suffer in the event of Client's cancellation due to the difficulty in re-selling the Space, and, accordingly, the parties have
agreed upon the liquidated damages set forth below as fair and reasonable compensation for such damages:
1.

Davs orior to Event:
30 Davs or More
0-29 Davs

% of Revehue Guarantee
75% of the Revenue Guarantee
100% of the Revenue Guarantee

Client's delivery arrangements that require a loading dock must be coordinated with LN forty eight (48) hours in advance of use. All
proceeds of parking operations shall be retained solely by LN. Notwithstanding the foregoing, should Client elect not to charge its
guests for parking, the cost for parking shall be added as a line item expense to the Special Event Order.
B. LN shall not be responsible, under any circumstances, for any loss or damage occurring to automobiles brought to the Venue by
Client's employees, subcontractors or guests.
4.

sell all food and beverages and retain one hundred percent {100%) of the profits therefrom. Client shall work with LN regarding all
commercially reasonable food and beverage related matters, including, without limitation, requests involving the service of alcoholic

a selected portion of a Client Recording as may be necessary to integrate a Client Recording into LN or its affiliates' applicable
promotional or marketing materials as contemplated herein. The rights granted to LN under this Agreement shall not otherwise affect

to use the Client Recordings as authorized herein.

Bethanie Fisher
Special Events Coordinator
City of Detroit - Media Services
2 Woodward Ave., Ste. 333
Detroit, Ml 48226
Dear Ms. Fisher:
I am writing on behalf of Wayne State University (WSU) for approval for rider participants
to access public rites of way throughout the City of Detroit for the fifth annual Baroudeur,
Saturday, August 17, 2019. With this in mind, I have attached a completed •City of Detroit
Specfal Events Appl lcatlon" on behalf of WSU,
The Baroudeur, an Initiative of Wayne State University President M. Rov WIison, is a noncompetitive activity that gives riders of all abilities a chance to explore the Detroit and
surrounding areas while cycling. More Importantly. the event raises scholarship dollars to
help students in financial need. The event also supports the League of Michigan Bicyclists
by participating In their $1 Per Rider Program, which helps promote cycling safety across
the state. The Baroudeur, which showcases some of our area's most noteworthy locatlons,
gives participants a firsthand-view of the striking transformation taking place in Detroit. In
tum, we hope that our riders encourage others to explore Detroit's Iconic treasures.
The 2019 Baroudeurfollows overwhelmingly successful events In 2015, 2016, 2017 and
2018. Nearly 1,000 riders toured metro Detroit along four courses during the Inaugural
event In 2015. Thanks to help from roughly 20 organizations and sponsors and nearly 300
volunteers, the rides in 2016, 2017 and 2018 ended without major incident or Injury. We
look forward to another successful and impactful event that nets positive results.
.About the ride

Riders can choose from 20, 37, 62 and 100-mile distances to ride. The routes begin and
end on Wayne State's main campus and will carry riders through parts of Detroit and
various other communities. Riders along each course will enjoy routes through Midtown,
Downtown, Belle Isle, the Iconic Woodward Avenue, Palmer Park and other historic
neighborhoods, gaining appreciation for Detroit's remarkable past, exciting present and
promising future.
Event impact

Armed with lessons from the past four years, we expect the Baroudeur's trek through
Detroit will produce minimal disruption to traffic flow. Our experience with past events and
our partnerships with law enforcement and regional governing bodies wlll aid us in reaching
our goal of an lncident~free ride for the 800-1000 riders we anticipate. As in past years, no
street closures are required for the routes, which wtll be marked by temporary signage.

 Rider responslblllty
In making these plans, we emphasize to riders that they will share roads with other vehicles
and that they are subject to all traffic laws governing public roads, including stop signs,
stoplights and proper lane usage. For your reference, I have attached details of the four
routes.

Public safety
Though our riders will assume the risks associated with bicycling, we are placing rider
safety among our highest priorities. With this in mind, we will again work closely with the
Detroit Police Department (OPO) and the Wayne State University Police Department
(WSUPD) to develop and implement safety measures for each of the proposed routes. The
safety plan for the Baroudeur Is passed on OPD's and WSUPD's previous experiences
with this and slmllar cycling events. Wayne State will enlist assistance from various other
law enforcement agencies along the planned routes.
First aid and emergency 'medical support
Hart Medical EMS will coordinate first aid services, emergency medical response and
medical transport. Hart will refine and implement a plan that follows closely the successful
strategies used for the past four years. our goal is to deliver a secure finish for every rider.

Hart Medloal has extensive experience supporting large-scale and high-visibility special
events In Southeast Michigan and is a leading provider of on-site medlcal care and
ambulance services for social, sporting, and cultural events of all sizes. With over three
decades of experience, Hart services venues and events including amphitheaters, concerts,
convention centers, corporate events, fairs, festivals, movie shoots, parks, perfonning arts
centers, sportlng events, trade shows and other events. Hart is an authorized city of Detroit
911 provider.
Other
We hope that this letter, the supporting documentation and your previous experience with
our working group gives you and the Special Event Management Team lhe confidence you
need to grant the Baroudeur your enthusiastic endorsement. On behalf of Wayne State, I
want you to know that we look forward to collegial and productive efforts with each of our
working partners, including the City of Detroit.
In closing, we invite you, your colleagues and your neighbors to participate In the event,
which offers riders refreshments along the route, a limited edition Baroudeur t-shlrt and
admission to a festive post-ride lunch on Wayne State's campus. For details about event
registration, please visit baroudeur.wayne.edu. If you need additional information, you can
reach me by email al mlockwood@wayne.edu or directly by phone at 313-577-9098.

Bethanie Fisher

Speclal Events Coordinator
City of Detroit - Media Services
2 Woodward Ave., Ste. 333
Detroit, Ml 48226
Dear Ms. Fisher:
I am writing on behalf of Wayne State University (WSU) for approval for rider participants
to access public rites of way throughout the City of Detroit for the fifth annual Baroudeur,
Saturday, August 17, 2019. With this In mind, I have attached a completed "City of Detroit
Specfal Events Applicatfon" on behalf of WSU,
The Baroudeur, an Initiative of Wayne State University President M. Roy WIison, is a noncompetitive activity that gives riders of all abilities a chance to explore the Detroit and
surrounding areas while cycling. More Importantly, the event raises scholarship dollars to
help students in financial need. The event also supports the League of Michigan Bicyclists
by participating in their $1 Per Rider Program, which helps promote cycling safety across
the state. The Baroudeur, which showcases some of our area's most noteworthy locations,
gives participants a firsthand-view of the striking transformation taking place in Detroit. In
tum, we hope that our riders encourage others to explore Detroit's Iconic treasures.
The 2019 Baroudeur follows overwhelmingly successful events in 2015, 2016, 2017 and
2018. Nearly 1,000 riders toured metro Detroit along four courses during the Inaugural
event in 2015. Thanks to help from roughly 20 organizations and sponsors and nearly 300
volunteers, the rides In 2016, 2017 and 2018 ended without major incident or injury. We
look forward to another successful and lmpactful event that nets positive results.

About the ride
Riders can choose from 20, 37, S2 and 100-mile distances to ride. The routes begin and
end on Wayne State's main campus and will carry riders through parts of Detroit and
various other communities. Riders along each course will enjoy routes through Midtown,
Downtown, Belle Isle, the Iconic Woodward Avenue, Palmer Park and other historic
neighborhoods, gaining appreciation for Detroit's remarl{able past, exciting present and
promising future.
Event impact

Anned with lessons from the past four years, we expect the Baroudeur's trek through
Detroit will produce minimal disruption to traffic flow. Our experience With past events and
our partnerships with law enforcement and regional governing bodies wlll aid us in reaching
our goal of an incident-free ride for the 800-1000 riders we anticipate. As in past years, no
street closures are required for the routes, which will be marked by temporary slgnage.

 2019 RIDE SNAPSHOT
The Baroudeur is a fun, noncompetitive cycling event that gives riders of varying abilities an
opportunity to explore Detroit and Its surrounding areas on two wheels while helping
economically disadvantaged students pursue higher education.
Event date
Saturday, August 17, 2019
Ridership
Roughly 1,000 riders e)(pectecl for 2019.

"Projection basedon 800 riders
Routes
With the exception of the second halves of the 62-mile and the 100-mile routes, the routes
will remain largely unchanged from 2018, with the four routes passing through Midtown,
Downtown, Belle Isle, four of the five Grosse Pointes and Palmer Park. Rather than routing
through the Downriver communities and Grosse lie as in the past, the updated 62- and 100mlle routes now stretch west and includes Hines Drlve to Livonia.
Rest stations
Four official rest and refreshment stations will be established along the Baroudeur routes.
The rest stations will offer an assortment of liquid refreshments and high-carbohydrate
snacks. All food and drink items will be prepackaged or self-service.

Attn: Ray Solomon & Monique Phillips

Dear Ray and Monique,

On behalf of the Quicken Loans Community Fund (QLCF) and the Family of Companies, I would
like to congratulate you and the Ctty of Detroit for receiving an AmerlCorps VISTA Grant from
the Corporation for N.itional and Community Service (CNCS} to support the placement of 7 fulltime VISTA members, one dedicated for each of the 7 Districts in Detroit.

VISTAS are leading outreach efforts on behalf of the Department of Neighborhoods (DON) that
provide assistance to each of the city's District Managers (7 total) by supporting the creation
and e)(panslon efforts of block clubs, assessing blight remediation programs, and expanding

economic opportunities for resldents through tax foreclosure prevention. VISTAS use the
laptops to perform a number of vital functions such as: tracking and entering all constituent
information into a tracking tool to document their concerns·· a function that helps the Dls1rlct
Managers maintain accurate and current records and address concerns in a timely fashion;
e-mailing and corresponding with constituents; creating documents to help start block clubs
and supporting capacity building for them; organizing meeting materials; Implementing
resource mapping, and; submitting departmental reports, among many others,

We also understand that the CNCS AmeriCorps VISTA Grant does not provide computers for the
VISTAs, and that the seven AmeriCorps VISTA members will each need ai:cess to a computer as
soon as possible. QLCF is committed to mak1ng a laptop donation consisting of (5) Refurbished
Dell 7740 Laptops valued at $47S each and (3} New Dell Latitude 34B0 vcilued c1t $700 each, to
support the activities of these new VISTA members. Beginning immediately, you may pick up
the computers at the following address: One Campus Martius, 1050 Woodward Avenue,
Detroit, Ml. The computer5 are currently being offered solely on a 90-day extended trial basis,
which can be further extended to 180-days at the request of either QLCF or the City. This trial
period is designed to determine whether the software and operating system of the computers

are compatible with the needs of the VISTA members. Contingent upon the Detroit City Council
and the Mayor's approval of a donation of the computers by QLCF ta the City, and upon a
mutual agreement between O,LCF and the City that the computers fit the needs of the VISTA
members, QLCF wlll permanently donate the computers to the City. The stated value Is $4,475.

The Quicken Loans Community Fund (Q.LCF) is not responsible for replacement or repair of any
lost, stolen, or damaged computers. At the end of the project term, the computers may be used
to support additional VISTA members or other volunteers and/or the Department of
Neighborhoods. QL expects that the City will treat the computers with the same level of care
given to other City owned technology and equipment.

Please accept this donation on behalf of QLCF as a symbol of our continued support of the
Department of Neighbomoods within the City of Detroit and the CNCS AmerlCorps VISTA
program. Please reach out to me if you have any questions or concerns.

Sincerely,
\.J✓

This request is being issued on behalf of Bagley Forest Property, LLC concerning the active
construction project at the comer of Livernois and Seven Mile. The petitioner is requesting to
vacate a strip of R.O.W. dlreotly adjacent to the property line along Stoepel Street (Refer to
the attached Site Plan).
The vacation of the R.O.W. is being requested to facilitate the placement of a new
transformer for the project. The project is located on a zero lot line parcel and is built out to
the property lines in every direction with the exception of a small loading area off the alley on
the south side of the property. This is an existing condition. During the planning of the project
a location In the loading area was selected to place the transformer in an effort to conceal II,
and keep It on the property. However, due to technical limitations, not revealed until
construction was underway, DTE cannot utilize the proposed location in the loading area.
The R.O.W. along Stoepel is Identified as 100', but reduces down to 70' just south of the site.
A vacation of approximate 15'-0" of the R.O.W along the length of the Stoepel Street property
line will satisfy the requirements of DTE, while still staying in line with the adjacent narrower
R.O.W. south of the site. The goal is to utilize the southern end of the vacated R.O.W. to
locate the transformer. As part of this work, new curbs, sidewalks and landscaping will be
Installed in compliance with the City of Detroit's zoning ordinance.
The project is far Into construction and currently being held up until a resolution can be
reached on a final transformer location. The entire team is eager to resolve this urgent issue.
If you have any questions please email me a1 bfriske@quinnevana.com.

RE:

Giffels Webster - Request for encroachment into the public alley right-of-way.

Giffels Webster, 28 W. Adams, Suite 1200, Detroit, Michigan 48226 on behalf of Bedrock Real Estate
Services, LLC, 1092 Woodward Avenue, Detroit, Michigan, 48226 respectfully requests to encroach into
the public alley, bounded by Woodward Avenue, W. Grand River Avenue, Griswold Street and State
Street, with the installation of a ramp with a railing and bollards.
We are requesting a 6 foot encroachment into the public alley right~of-way, which will extend from
approximately 4 feet below grade to 6 feet above grade in height to accommodate the installation of ramp,
railing, and bollards.
This encroachment will neither impede pedestrian nor vehicular traffic, nor will it interfere with the
maintenance of the public rights-of-way, including utility company and Fire Department access. The
requested encroachment maintains a 14 foot wide access way within the alley for vehicular use. Obtaining
this encroachment is critical to fully utilize the rear of the property for deliveries of goods for the retail
establishment. Drawings of the proposed location of encroachments are attached.
If you should have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact Giffels Webster planner, Deirdre Clein
at (Pl 313.962.4442 or dclein@giffelswebster.com.

The Honorable City Council
ATTN: Janice M. Winfrey, City Clerk
Office of the City Clerk
200 Coleman A. Young Municipal Center
Detroit, Ml 48226
Dear Ms. Winfrey:
Vanguard Community Development has been a leader in the historic North End neighborhood of Detroit
since 1994, when it was founded by Bishop Edgar Vann. As the most senior North End community
development organization, with the most capacity for development, we feel the responsibility to brand
the community and preserve its identity amidst a rapidly changing area.
Thus, we sought and have been awarded a grant from the Michigan State Housing Development
Authority (MSHDA) to fund permanent signage identifying the entrance to the North End at Woodward
& E Grand Blvd. The sign will occupy the median of E Grand Blvd, similar to the "New Center" sign just
across the intersection on West Grand Boulevard. Additionally, we will support this placemaking effort
by hanging light pole banners along East Grand Boulevard (on the north side of the road) and Woodward
Avenue (on the east side of the road, north of E Grand Blvd). The installation will occur in October 2017.
The design for the permanent sign and banners will elegantly represent the culture of the North End,
namely our architectural treasure chest of historic homes. The sign will be made of wrought iron for a
simple and classic feel, with the words "The Historic North End" front and center. The banners will say,
"Welcome to the Historic North End," and feature a silhouette of an historic home. Vanguard and our
board of community advisors feel that the North End needs to assert its identity and sense of place as
the areas around it experience a great deal of redevelopment. Sign age is an important step in guiding
the neighborhood as it grows with and within Detroit.

Pamela Martin-Turner
President and CEO
Vanguard Community Development

Re:

RESCHEDULED CLOSED SESSION - Legal Representation and
Indemnification in lawsuit of William Anderson/Betty Taylor v. City of
Detroit, Civil Action Case No. 18-009696-CD for Captain Octaveious
Miles (retired)

On April 2, 2019, Your Honorable Body adopted a resolution regarding the
above-referenced matter, to deny representation and indemnification of Captain
Octaveious Miles (retired), Badge No. NIA.
The past practice of City Council is to hold hearings for police officers who have
been denied representation, in accordance with arbitration awards issued by the
Voluntary Labor Arbitration Tribunal. The closed session previously scheduled for
May 7, 2019 was cancelled due to time constraints. After consultation with the
Council President's office, the Law Department is respectfully requesting that the
rescheduled closed session be held on Tuesday, June 11, 2019 at 2:00 p.m.
A request for a hearing was not triggered in this case because both the Law
Department and DPD recommended approval of representation and
indemnification. Captain Miles is entitled to receive and the City of Detroit is
required to hold this hearing.
