I. INTRODUCTION

In order to promote the revitalization of environmentally distressed and blighted areas
within the boundaries of the City of Detroit, Michigan (the ?City?), the City has established
the City of Detroit Brown?eld Redevelopment Authority (the pursuant to
Michigan Public Act 381 of 1996, as amended (?Act 381?).

The primary purpose of this Brown?eld Plan (?Plan?) is to promote the redevelopment of
and private investment in certain ?brown?eld? properties within the City. Inclusion of
property within this Plan will facilitate ?nancing of environmental response and other
eligible activities at eligible properties and will also provide tax incentives to eligible
taxpayers willing to invest in revitalization of eligible sites, commonly referred to as
?brown?elds.? By facilitating redevelopment of brown?eld properties, this Plan is
intended to promote economic growth for the bene?t of the residents of the City and all
taxing units located within and bene?ted by the DBRA.

This Plan is intended to apply to the eligible property identi?ed in this Plan and, if tax
increment revenues are proposed to be captured from that eligible property, to identify and
authorize the eligible activities to be funded by such tax increment revenues.

This Plan is intended to be a living document, which may be modi?ed or amended in
accordance with the requirements of Act 381, as necessary to achieve the purposes of Act
381. A subsequent change to the identi?cation or designation of developer after the
approval of this Plan by the governing body shall not necessitate an amendment to the Plan,
affect the application of this Plan to the eligible property or impair the rights available to
the DBRA under this Plan. The applicable sections of Act 381 are noted throughout the
Plan for reference purposes.

This Plan describes the project to be completed (see Attachment C) and contains all of the
information required by Section 13(2) of Act 381.

Corktown Lofts LLC, an af?liate of Bedrock Management Services LLC, is the project
developer (?Developer?) and owner of the Property. The existing historic structure known
as the Corktown Lofts consists of approximately 180,573 square feet and is being
rehabilitated into a mixed-use development. The rehabilitation is anticipated to create retail
and restaurant/cafe space on the ?rst two ?oors and one subgrade floor; of?ce space on the
middle two floors, and 33 residential units on the upper two ?oors, consisting of
rehabilitated facilities on the ?fth ?oor (22 units) and a new addition above it (11 units).
The of?ce Space will house a major, Chicago?based logistics company and is anticipated
to bring approximately 500 jobs to the City of Detroit, approximately 350 of which are
anticipated to be new jobs.

The Adjoining Parking Structure is a newly constructed, approximately 465?space parking
garage intended to serve the of?ce space within the Corktown Lofts, while also supporting
the retail and residential components and general public parking needs. The garage will
include ?rst ?oor retail space. While tenants have not yet been identi?ed, it is anticipated
that the retail will include food and beverage and other neighborhood-supportive retail. It
is further anticipated that approximately 250 spaces will be dedicated to the of?ce tenants,
with the remaining spaces available to support the retail uses and general public parking
needs in the area. As explained furth er below, all eligible activities in this Plan are limited
to the construction of the multilevel parking structure located at 1 701 W. Lafayette.

Attachment provides a more extensive description of the project to be completed at the
Property (the ?Project?), including programming diagrams and renderings. The project
description provided herein is a summary of the proposed development at the time of the
adoption of this Plan. The actual development may vary from the project description
provided herein, without necessitating an amendment to this Plan, so long as such
variations arise as a result of changes in market and/or ?nancing conditions affecting the
Project and/or are related to the addition or immaterial removal of amenities to the
Project. Any material changes, as determined by DBRA in its sole discretion, to the project
description are subject to the approval of the DBRA staff and shall be consistent with the
overall nature of the proposed development, its proposed public purpose, and the purposes
of Act 381.

Exhibit A
Corktown Lofts
Brown?eld Redevelopment Plan

B. Basis of Eligibilih? {Section 13 and Section 2 

The Property is considered ?eligible property? as de?ned by Act 381, Section 2 because
the Property was previously utilized or is currently utilized for a commercial purpose;
it is located within the City of Detroit, a quali?ed local governmental unit under Act
381; and the Corktown Lofts structure has been determined to be an historic resource,
and the development of the adjacent and contiguous parcel the Adjoining Parking
Garage) is estimated to increase the captured taxable value of the Corktown Lofts structure.

Under Section 2(v) of Act 381, "Historic resource" means that term as de?ned in section
90a of the Michigan strategic fund act, 1984 PA 270, MCL 125.2090a. The Michigan
Strategic Fund Act de?nes an "historic resource" as a publicly or privately owned historic
building, structure, site, object, feature, or open space either manmade or natural,
individually listed or located within and contributing to a historic district designated by the
national register of historic places, the state register of historic sites, or a local unit acting
under the local historic districts act, 1970 PA 169, MCL 399.201 to 399.215.

As stated above, the Corktown Lofts building, previously known as the Edson, Moore and
Company Building, was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places in
2017 and is thus an ?historic resource? as de?ned under Act 381 and the Michigan Strategic
Fund Act.2

C. Summarv ofEligible Activities and Description of Costs (Section 13 

The ?eligible activities? that are intended to be carried out at the Property are considered
?eligible activities? as de?ned by Section 2 of Act 381 because they include ?demolition?
as de?ned under Section of Act 381 and ?infrastructure improvements? as
de?ned under Section 2(aa), and more particularly, consist of a ?multilevel parking
structure? eligible under Section 2(aa)(ii) of Act 381.

The Developer desires to be reimbursed for the costs of eligible activities. Tax increment
revenue generated by the Property will be captured by the DBRA and used to reimburse
the cost of the eligible activities completed on the Property pursuant to the terms of a
Reimbursement Agreement to be executed by the DBRA and Developer after approval of
this Plan (the ?Reimbursement Agreement?), to the extent permitted by Act 381.

Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the DBRA, all eligible activities shall commence
within eighteen (18) months after the date the governing body approves this Plan and shall
be completed within three (3) years after approval of the Michigan Strategic Fund (MSF)
work plan, if applicable, or three (3) years after execution of the Reimbursement
Agreement.

Exhibit A
Corktown Lofts
Brown?eld Redevelopment Plan

A summary of the eligible activities and the estimated cost of each eligible activity intended
to be paid for with Tax Increment Revenues from the Property are shown in the table
attached hereto as Attachment E. The eligible activities described in Attachment are not
exhaustive. Subject to the approval of DBRA staff in writing, additional eligible activities
may be carried out at the Property, without requiring an amendment to this Plan, so long
as such eligible activities are permitted by Act 381 and the performance of such eligible
activities does not exceed the total costs stated in Attachment E.

As set forth in Attachment E, Developer is seeking reimbursement only for the cost of
eligible activities related to the construction of the Adjoining Parking Garage and is n_o_t
seeking reimbursement for the cost of eligible activities related to the rehabilitation of the
historic Corktown Lofts structure. Construction of the Adjoining Parking Garage began in
the ?rst quarter of 2019 with site and foundation work. Erection of the precast concrete
structure commenced in June 2019. It is anticipated that all eligible activities on the Project
will be completed prior to December 31, 2019; provided however, any long-term
monitoring or operation and maintenance activities or obligations that may be required will
continue to be performed in compliance with the terms of this Plan and any documents
prepared pursuant to this Plan.

In the event this Plan contemplates the capture of tax increment revenue derived from
?taxes levied for school operating purposes? (as de?ned by Section 2(uu) of Act 381 and
hereinafter referred to as ?School Taxes?), the Developer acknowledges and agrees that
obligation to reimburse the Developer for the cost of eligible activities with tax
increment revenue derived from Local Taxes, or Speci?c Taxes that are considered Local
Taxes, (as these capitalized terms are de?ned by Act 381) is contingent upon: the
Developer receiving at least the initial applicable work plan approvals by the MSF and the
Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE), as may be
required pursuant to Act 381, within 180 days after the date this Plan is approved by the
governing body, or such other date as the DBRA may agree to in writing or (ii) the
Developer providing the DBRA with evidence, satisfactory to DBRA, that the Developer
has the ?nancial means to complete the project without the capture of, and subsequent
reimbursement with, the contemplated School Taxes.

Attachment sets forth the total cost of eligible activities for the Adjoining Parking
Garage. Developer, however, understands and acknowledges that reimbursement for the
cost of eligible activities will to be subject to the ?look-back? provisions in Section 2a of
the DBRA Guidelines, as in effect as of the time of Plan approval, and that actual
reimbursement for eligible activities will therefore be less than the amount set forth in
Attachment E. Developer further understands and acknowledges that Developer will have
to provide documentation establishing the date of payment for eligible activities, and that
Developer will be reimbursed only for those eligible activities the costs of which were
incurred within 240 days of the approval of this Plan by the Governing Body.

The line-item costs listed in Attachment are estimated costs and may increase or decrease
depending on unknown conditions encountered on the Property. The actual cost of those

5

Exhibit A
Corktown Lofts
Brown?eld Redevelopment Plan

eligible activities encompassed by this Plan that will qualify for reimbursement from tax
increment revenues of the DBRA from the Property shall be governed by the terms of the
Reimbursement Agreement. No costs of eligible activities will be quali?ed for
reimbursement except to the extent permitted in accordance with the terms and conditions
of the Reimbursement Agreement and Act 381.

The Reimbursement Agreement and this Plan will dictate the total cost of eligible activities
subject to payment, provided that the total cost of eligible activities subject to payment or
reimbursement under the Reimbursement Agreement shall not exceed the estimated costs
set forth in Attachment B. As long as the total costs are not exceeded, line item costs of
eligible activities may be adjusted after the date this Plan is approved by the governing
body, to the extent the adjustments do not violate the terms of the MSF work plan.

D. Estimate of Captured Taxable Value and Tax Increment Revenues (Section
Beginning Date of Capture of Tax Increment Revenues (Section 
Impact of Tax Increment Financing on Taxing Jurisdictions (Section 

This Plan anticipates the capture of tax increment revenues to reimburse the Developer for
the costs of eligible activities under this Plan in accordance with the Reimbursement
Agreement. Subject to Section 13(b)(16) of Act 381, a table of estimated tax increment
revenues to be captured is attached to this Plan as Attachment F. Please note that the ?gures
provided in Attachment are estimates and are subject to change depending on actual
assessed value and changes in

millage rates.

Exhibit A
Corktown Lofts
Brown?eld Redevelopment Plan

In addition, the following taxes are projected to be generated but shall not be captured during
the life of this Plan:

 

City Debt $2,404,591
School Debt $4,465,669
DIA 68,703
Zoo $34,351
TOTAL $9,621,821

The Project anticipates a Neighborhood Enterprise Zone (NEZ) tax abatement to be
approved on the 22 rehabilitated apartment units which are part of the overall Corktown
Lofts mixed-use project. If approved, the NEZ will abate 100% of incremental real
property taxes on this limited portion of the Property for the periods applicable under the
applicable abatement certi?cate, thereby reducing the amount of tax increment revenues
available under this Plan. This abatement is included in the tax capture assumptions
provided with this Plan

In no event shall the duration of this Plan exceed thirty-?ve (35) years following the date
of the governing body?s resolution approving this Plan, nor shall the duration of the tax
capture exceed the lesser of the period authorized under subsection (5) of Section 13 of Act
381 or 30 years. Further, in no event shall the beginning date of the capture of tax increment
revenues be later than ?ve (5) years after the date of the governing body?s resolution
approving this Plan.

E. Plan of Financing (Section Maximum Amount of Indebtedness (Section

1312113?

The eligible activities are to be ?nanced solely by the Developer. The DBRA will
reimburse the Developer for the cost of approved eligible activities, but only from tax
increment revenues generated from the Property. No advances have been or shall be made
by the City or the DBRA for the costs of eligible activities under this Plan.

All reimbursements authorized under this Plan shall be governed by the Reimbursement
Agreement. The inclusion of eligible activities and estimates of costs to be reimbursed in
this Plan are intended to authorize the DBRA to fund such reimbursements and does not
obligate the DBRA or the City to fund any reimbursement or to enter into the
Reimbursement Agreement providing for the reimbursement of any costs for which tax
increment revenues may be captured under this Plan, or which are permitted to be
reimbursed under this Plan. The amount and source of any tax increment revenues that
will be used for purposes authorized by this Plan, and the terms and conditions for such
use and upon any reimbursement of the expenses permitted by this Plan, will be provided
solely under the Reimbursement Agreement contemplated by this Plan.

Exhibit A
Corktown Lofts
Brown?eld Redevelopment Plan

Unless otherwise agreed upon by the Developer, the DBRA, and the State of Michigan, the
DBRA shall not incur any note or bonded indebtedness to ?nance the purposes of this Plan.

Reimbursements under the Reimbursement Agreement shall not exceed the cost of Eligible
Activities permitted under this Plan.

F. Duration of Plan {Section 

Subject to Section 13b(16) of Act 381, the beginning date and duration of capture of tax
increment revenues for each eligible property shall occur in accordance with the TIF table
described in Exhibit F. In no event, however, shall this Plan extend beyond the maximum
term allowed by Section 13(2)(f) of Act 381 for the duration of this Plan.

Furthermore, this Plan, or any subsequent amendment thereto, may be abolished or
terminated in accordance with Section 14(8) of Act 381 in the event of any of the following:

a. The governing body may abolish this Plan (or any subsequent amendment
thereto) when it ?nds that the purposes for which this Plan was established have been
accomplished.

of the following: gives 30 days? written notice to the Developer at its last known address
by certi?ed mail or other method that documents proof of delivery attempted; and (ii)
provides the Developer with an opportunity to be heard at a public meeting.

Notwithstanding anything in this subsection to the contrary, this Plan (or any subsequent
amendment thereto) shall not be abolished or terminated until the principal and interest on
bonds, if any, issued under Section 17 of Act 381 and all other obligations to which the tax
increment revenues are pledged have been paid or funds suf?cient to make the payment
have been identi?ed or segregated.

The Project consists of the rehabilitation of the historic Corktown Lofts building into a
mixed-use development and the construction of a multilevel parking garage on the adjacent
and contiguous parcel. The existing historic structure consists of approximately 180,573
square feet. The rehabilitation will create retail and restaurant/cafe space on the ?rst two
?oors and one subgrade ?oor; of?ce space on the middle two floors, and approximately 33
residential units on the upper two floors, consisting of rehabilitated facilities on the ?fth
?oor (approximately 22 units) and a new addition above it (approximately 11 units). The
of?ce space will house a major, Chicago?based logistics company and is anticipated to
bring approximately 500 jobs to the City of Detroit, 350 of which are anticipated to be new

The Adjoining Parking Structure will be a newly constructed, 465-space parking garage
intended to serve the of?ce space within the Corktown Lofts while also supporting the
retail and residential components and general public parking needs. While tenants have not
yet been identi?ed, it is anticipated that the retail will include food and beverage and other
neighborhood-supportive retail. It is further anticipated that approximately 250 spaces will
be dedicated to the of?ce tenants, with the remaining spaces available to support the retail

uses and general public parking needs in the area. As explained previously, all eligible
activities in this Plan are limited to the construction of this multilevel parking structure.

A depiction of the prior site conditions and rendering of the multilevel parking structure,
follow below. As appears below, the Project required demolition of the existing but

abandoned commercial building at I701 Lafayette to make way for the new structure.

Dear Ms. Kanalos,

The Corktown Business Association is pleased to offer this letter of support for
Corktown Lofts Brown?eld Tax Increment Financing (TIF) application.

The Corktown Lofts project will bring an estimated 500 jobs to our growing
neighborhood, along with new residential and retail options. These new workers and
residents will not only boost the economy and support the existing businesses
throughout Corktown, enhancing the vibrancy of our community, but will have an
impact on the entire city's economy and tax base.

As part of the project, we understand that Corktown Lofts LLC intends to construct a
parking garage that will provide much?needed parking to both visitors to the
neighborhood as well as future of?ce tenants of the building. Members of our
Association look forward to this additional amenity, as parking has waned while
development in our neighborhood has grown.

We look forward to welcoming future residential and commercial tenants to the
neighborhood and are pleased to support this Brown?eld Tax Increment Financing
application.

Sincerely yours,

Bob Roberts
President

Detroit?s youth with education, mentorship and job training, including robotics, financial literacy,

This partnership will also support Detroit transformative Girls Changing the Game initiative,
expanding quality programming for the participants Detroit PAL currently serves, and increasing

I. INTRODUCTION

In order to promote the revitalization of environmentally distressed and blighted areas within the
boundaries of the City of Detroit, Michigan (the ?City?), the City has established the City of
Detroit Brown?eld Redevelopment Authority (the pursuant to Michigan Public Act
381 of 1996, as amended (?Act 381?).

The primary purpose of this Brown?eld Plan (the ?Plan?) is to promote the redevelopment of
and private investment in certain ?brown?eld? properties within the City. Inclusion of property
within this Plan will facilitate ?nancing of environmental response and other eligible activities at
eligible properties, and will also provide tax incentives to eligible taxpayers willing to invest in
revitalization of eligible sites, commonly referred to as ?brown?elds.? By facilitating
redevelopment of brown?eld properties, this Plan is intended to promote economic growth for
the bene?t of the residents of the City and all taxing units located within and bene?ted by the
DBRA.

This Plan is intended to apply to the eligible property identi?ed in this Plan and, if tax increment
revenues are proposed to be captured from that eligible property, to identify and authorize the
eligible activities to be funded by such tax increment revenues.

This Plan is intended to be a living document, which may be modi?ed or amended in accordance
with the requirements of Act 381, as necessary to achieve the purposes of Act 381. The
identi?cation or designation of a developer or proposed use of the eligible property shall not
necessitate an amendment to this Plan, affect the application of this Plan to the eligible property
or impair the rights available to the DBRA under this Plan. The applicable sections of Act 381
are noted throughout the Plan for reference purposes.

This Plan describes the project to be completed (see Attachment C) and contains all the
information required by Section 13(2) of Act 381.

Legal Description

PLATS, 17/550 97.42 IRREG

 

Jefferson Van Dyke 2 LLC, is the project developer (the ?Developer?). The proposed future use
of the Property is to renovate the existing buildings, demolish the existing parking structure and

2

 

construct a new parking structure with approximately 136 spaces, construct approximately 36
new residential units, and improve the existing pedestrian plaza. The existing buildings on the
site to be renovated include two former residences (the ?White House? and a former residence),
the carriage house, and an ?in?ll retail building? (the ?Project?) and are shown in Figure 3. The
existing buildings on the Property are currently vacant. The parking deck is not used.

It is currently anticipated construction will begin in January 2020 and eligible activities will be
completed within three years from the commencement of construction. The project description
provided herein is a summary of the proposed development at the time of the adoption of the
Plan. The actual development may vary from the project description provided herein, without
necessitating an amendment to this Plan, so long as such variations are not material and arise as a
result of changes in market and/or ?nancing conditions affecting the Project and/or are related to
the addition or immaterial removal of amenities to the Project. All material changes, as
determined by DBRA in its sole discretion, to the project description are subject to the approval
of the DBRA staff and shall be consistent with the overall nature of the proposed development,
its proposed public purpose, and the purposes of Act 381.

Attachment provides a description of the Project to be completed at the site and Attachment 
includes letters of support for the Project.

B. Basis of Eligibilitv {Section 13 and Section 2 (on

The Property is considered an ?eligible property? as de?ned by Act 381, Section 2 because: 
the Property was previously utilized for a commercial purpose; it is located within the City of
Detroit, a quali?ed local governmental unit under Act 381; the parcel at 7891 East Jefferson
Avenue was determined to be a facility in accordance to Part 201 of Michigan?s Natural
Resources and Environmental Protection Act, 1994 PA 451, and the parcel at 7903 East
Jefferson Avenue is adjacent and contiguous and the development of the adjacent and contiguous
parcel is estimated to increase the captured taxable value of the remainder of the Property.

The Property was developed with two dwellings on the eastern half of the Property as early as
1910. These buildings include the existing "White House" and a former residence that is
currently part of the existing ?in?ll retail building?. These buildings have been used as of?ces
and as a tavern/club, and may be connected via an underground tunnel. The carriage house,
located north of the described dwellings, appears to have been a converted garage that was once
associated with a dwelling, and has been used as a studio, salon and retailer. The commercial
storefronts that are currently part of the ?in?ll retail building? have been used as a tavern,
cleaner and dyer, retailers, of?ces, and a ?orist since their construction in the late
19203. Historical uses have included the following address and use pairings: 7903 East Jefferson
Avenue - Hudson Cleaners Dyers (19305) and 7903 East Jefferson Avenue Sanders Tri
Cleaning clothes cleaner (19305, 19403). The parking deck appears to have been constructed in
1935. At least four gasoline underground storage tanks (USTs) were located south of the parking
deck and past uses included historical greasing operations. See Figure 3 for building locations
and signi?cant site features.

A soils sampling investigation conducted on January 21, 2019, determined concentrations of
VOCs and PNAs in soil at the Property exceeding the applicable Generic Residential Clean-up
Criteria (GRCC). The most recent Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) of 7891 and
7903 Jefferson Avenue 567 Van Dyke Street was completed for Jefferson Van Dyke 2 LLC on
June 21, 2019. Recognized environmental conditions (RECs) were identi?ed in connection with
the former on-site dry cleaners, former on?site auto/engine related services, the known release at
the east adjoining Sunoco ?lling station, and the use of at least four gasoline USTs at the
Property.

The most recent BEA was completed for Jefferson Van Dyke 2 LLC on July 9, 2019 and
submitted to the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE).

C. of Eligible Activities and Description of Costs (Section 13 

The ?eligible activities? that are intended to be carried out at the Property are considered
?eligible activities? as de?ned by Section 2 of Act 381, because they include environmental
assessments, site demolition, department speci?c activities, remediation and additional response
activities, public infrastructure, site preparation, preparation of a Brown?eld Plan and 381 Work
Plan, and associated professional and project management costs as described herein.

A summary of the eligible activities and the estimated cost of each eligible activity intended to
be paid for with Tax Increment Revenues from the Property are shown in the table attached
hereto as Attachment and summarized below. The eligible activities described in Attachment
are not exhaustive. Subject to the approval of DBRA staff in writing, additional eligible
activities may be carried out at the Property, without requiring an amendment to this Plan, so
long as such eligible activities are permitted by Act 381 and the cost of such eligible activities
does not exceed the total costs stated in Attachment E.

It is currently anticipated construction will begin in January 2020. Unless otherwise agreed to in
writing by the DBRA, all eligible activities shall commence within eighteen (18) months after
the date the governing body approves this Plan and be completed within three (3) years after
approval of the Michigan Strategic Fund (MSF) work plan, if applicable, or three (3) years after
execution of the Reimbursement Agreement (as that term is de?ned below). Any long-term
monitoring or operation and maintenance activities or obligations that may be required will be
performed in compliance with the terms of this Plan and any documents prepared pursuant to this
Plan.

The Developer desires to be reimbursed for the costs of eligible activities incurred by it as
described below. Some eligible activities may commence prior to the adoption of this Plan and
to the extent permitted by Act 381 shall be reimbursable pursuant to the Reimbursement
Agreement. Tax increment revenue generated by the Property will be captured by the DBRA
and used to reimburse the cost of the eligible activities completed on the Property pursuant to the
terms of a Reimbursement Agreement to be executed by the DBRA and the Developer after
approval of this Plan (the ?Reimbursement Agreement?), to the extent permitted by Act 381. In
the event this Plan contemplates the capture of tax increment revenue derived from ?taxes levied

for school operating purposes? (as de?ned by Section 2(uu) of Act 381 and hereinafter referred
to as ?School Taxes?), the Developer acknowledges and agrees that obligation to
reimburse the Developer for the cost of eligible activities with tax increment revenue derived
from Local Taxes, or Speci?c Taxes that are considered Local Taxes, (as these capitalized terms
are de?ned by Act 381) is contingent upon: the Developer receiving at least the initial
applicable work plan approvals by the MSF and EGLE, as may be required pursuant to Act 381,
within 180 days after the date this Plan is approved by the governing body, or such other date as
the DBRA may agree to in writing or (ii) the Developer providing the DBRA with evidence,
satisfactory to DBRA, that the Developer has the ?nancial means to complete the project without
the capture of, and subsequent reimbursement with, the contemplated School Taxes.

The costs listed in Attachment are estimated costs and may increase or decrease depending on
the nature and extent of environmental contamination and other unknown conditions encountered
on the Property. The actual cost of those eligible activities encompassed by this Plan that will
qualify for reimbursement from tax increment revenues of the DBRA from the Property shall be
governed by the terms of the Reimbursement Agreement. No costs of eligible activities will be
quali?ed for reimbursement except to the extent permitted in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the Reimbursement Agreement and Act 381. The Reimbursement Agreement and
this Plan will dictate the total cost of eligible activities subject to payment or reimbursement,
provided that the total cost of eligible activities subject to payment or reimbursement under the
Reimbursement Agreement shall not exceed the estimated costs set forth in Attachment B. As
long as the total costs are not exceeded, line item costs of eligible activities may be adjusted after
the date this Plan is approved by the governing body, to the extent the adjustments do not violate
the terms of the approved EGLE or MSF work plan.

B. Estimate of Captured Taxable Value and Tax Increment Revenues (Section 
Beginning Date of Capture of Tax Increment Revenues (Section Impact 0f Tax
Increment Financing on Taxing Jurisdictions (Section 

This Plan anticipates the capture of tax increment revenues to reimburse the Developer for the
costs of eligible activities under this Plan in accordance with the Reimbursement Agreement.
Subject to Section 13(b)(l6) of Act 381, a table of estimated tax increment revenues to be
captured (Brown?eld Plan TIF Capture table) is attached to this Plan as Attachment F. A table
of estimated reimbursement (Brown?eld Plan Reimbursement table) is attached to this Plan as

The Developer anticipates approval of an Act 146 (Obsolete Property Rehabilitation Act)
property tax abatement up to twelve (12) years, including the six (6) year school tax capture, for
the Project. In the event the above referenced abatement is approved, the tax abatement will
reduce the property tax obligations of Property for the periods applicable under the applicable
abatement certi?cate, thereby reducing the amount of tax increment revenues available under
this Plan. This abatement is included in the tax capture assumptions provided with this Plan in
Attachment F.

In no event shall the duration of this Plan exceed thirty-?ve (35) years following the date of the
governing body?s resolution approving the Original Plan, nor shall the duration of the tax capture

6

exceed the lesser of the period authorized under subsection (3) and (5) of Section 13 of Act 381
or 30 years. Further, in no event shall the beginning date of the capture of tax increment
revenues be later than ?ve (5) years after the date of the governing body?s resolution approving
this Plan.

E. Plan of Financing (Section 13(2j?m: Maximum of Indebtedness [Section
1312119)!

The eligible activities are to be ?nanced solely by the Developer. The DBRA will reimburse the
Developer for the cost of approved eligible activities, but only from tax increment revenues
generated from the Property. No advances have been or shall be made by the City or the DBRA
for the costs of eligible activities under this Plan.

All reimbursements authorized under this Plan shall be governed by the Reimbursement
Agreement. The inclusion of eligible activities and estimates of costs to be reimbursed in this
Plan are intended to authorize the DBRA to fund such reimbursements and does not obligate the
DBRA or the City to fund any reimbursement or to enter into the Reimbursement Agreement
providing for the reimbursement of any costs for which tax increment revenues may be captured
under this Plan, or which are permitted to be reimbursed under this Plan. The amount and source
of any tax increment revenues that will be used for purposes authorized by this Plan, and the
terms and conditions for such use and upon any reimbursement of the expenses permitted by this
Plan, will be provided solely under the Reimbursement Agreement contemplated by this Plan.

Unless otherwise agreed upon by the Developer, the DBRA, and the State of Michigan, the
DBRA shall not incur any note or bonded indebtedness to ?nance the purposes of this Plan.

Reimbursements under the Reimbursement Agreement shall not exceed the cost of eligible
activities permitted under this Plan.

F. Duration of Plan [Section 

Subject to Section 13b(16) of Act 381, the beginning date of capture of tax increment revenues
for each eligible property shall occur in accordance with the tax increment ?nancing (TIF) table
described in Exhibit F. In no event, however, shall this Plan extend beyond the maximum term
allowed by Section 13(2)(f) of Act 381 for the duration of this Plan.

Furthermore, this Plan, or any subsequent amendment thereto, may be abolished or terminated in
accordance with Section 14(8) of Act 381 in the event of any of the following:

a. The governing body may abolish this Plan (or any subsequent amendment thereto)
when it ?nds that the purposes for which this Plan was established have been accomplished.

following the date of the governing body resolution approving this Plan (or any subsequent
amendment thereto), provided that the governing body ?rst does both of the following: gives
30 days? written notice to the Developer at its last known address by certi?ed mail or other

method that documents proof of delivery attempted; and (ii) provides the Developer with an
opportunity to be heard at a public meeting.

Notwithstanding anything in this subsection to the contrary, this Plan (or any subsequent
amendment thereto) shall not be abolished or terminated until the principal and interest on bonds,
if any, issued under Section 17 of Act 381 and all other obligations to which the tax increment
revenues are pledged have been paid or funds suf?cient to make the payment have been
identi?ed or segregated.

G. Effective Date of Inclusion in Brown?eld Plan
The Property will become a part of this Plan on the date this Plan is approved by the governing
body.

H. DisnlaeementfReloeation of Individuals on Eligible Property (Section

TIF Tables

Exhibit A
Jefferson Van Dyke
Brown?eld Redevelopment Plan

Cantu red Taxable Value and Tax Increment Revenues Estimates

The initial taxable value will be the taxable value of the Property at the time of Plan
approval, as shown by the 2019 assessment role at $145,048. For illustration purposes
only, this Plan uses a projected future taxable value of $3,505,913, which is the estimated
future taxable value of the Property at the time of the next assessment roll after project
completion. The captured taxable value will be the difference between the initial taxable
value and the actual taxable value for each year for which this Plan is in effect.

A table of the total estimated tax increment revenues to be captured for the entire project
is attached to this Plan. Tax capture required for reimbursement of Eligible Activities as
described in this Plan is estimated at 27 years from 2020 using both Local Taxes and
School Taxes. Conservative assumptions were included in the captured taxable value and
tax rates. These assumptions are used for illustrative purposes only, and are not intended
to limit reimbursement of the actual annual tax capture amount. In the event that the
actual incremental tax capture is greater than the amount illustrated in the attached tables,
the Project will be eligible for reimbursement of the Eligible Activities described in this
Plan up to the actual incremental tax capture after contributions to the DBRA
administrative, and will not be limited to the amount illustrated for reimbursement in this
Plan. The following assumptions were used to develop the attached tables.

1. The capture of both Local Taxes and School Taxes are included in calculating
recapture.

2. Annual appreciation in taxable value is assumed at 

3. This Plan assumes an Act 146 tax abatement for the commercial, parking, and
housing components of the Project for the ?rst 12 years of capture. These are
illustrated on the attached Brown?eld TIF Capture table as OPRA Tax
Abatement.

RE: Obsolete PrOperty Rehabilitation Certificate - 6001 Cass Owner LLC
Property Address: 6001 Cass Avenue
Parcel Number: 02002158.

Dear Ms. Trudeau:

The Office of the Chief Financial Of?cer, Office of the Assessor, has reviewed the proposed Obsolete PrOperty Rehabilitation
certificate application for the property located at 6001 Cass Avenue near the New Center area of the City of Detroit.

The rationale for granting Obsolete Property Rehabilitation certificates under PA 146 of 2000, as amended, is based on the
anticipation of increased market value upon completion of new construction and /or significant rehabilitation of existing commercial
property and commercial housing property. Normal repair and maintenance are not assessed and do not necessarily generate

additional market value.

6001 Cass LLC plans to rehabilitate the building for retail, event and Office space. The majority of the building is currently vacant
with only a geology lab and maintenance storage space occupying the ?rst floor. The six-story building is a 142,035 square foot
office building with an attached 9,478 square foot garage built in 1930 on .914 acres of land. Rehabilitation will include restoring
the existing structure that is functionally obsolete, blighted and a historical resource by restoring the exterior structure, renovating
the interior for retail, of?ce and event space and updating and replacing mechanical equipment.

The 2019 values are as follows:

 

 

 

 

 

 

Building Assessed Building Land Land
Parcel Address Value (SEV) Taxable Value Assessed Value (SEV) Taxable Value
02002158. 6001 Cass 688,000 688.000 416.300 416,300

 

 

 

 

This property meets the criteria set forth under PA 146 of 2000, as amended. It applies to blighted, functionally obsolete and
contaminated properties. "Rehabilitation," meaning that changes to qualified facilities that are required to restore or modify the
property, together with all appurtenances, to an economically efficient condition.

The property is located near the New Center area and is expected to increase commercial activity, create employment and revitalize
an urban area.

A field investigation indicated that the property located at 6001 Cass Avenue is eligible as it pertains to the Obsolete Property
Rehabilitation Act under PA 146 of 2000, as amended.

Sincerely,

  

Charles ricson, MMAO

What is the plan for hiring Detroiters?

We estimate our total permanentjob creation will be approximately 100 FTE. We

encourage all partner general contractors to employ Detroiters and also work to connect
local hiring organizations and programs to these partners. We have attended several
D2D sessions and will continue to use it as a resource to hire Detroit-based contractors.
During post construction our development will employ approximately 2 FTE. We also
anticipate that our office tenants will create approximately 500 FTE and ground-floor
retail businesses will create up to approximately 25 FTE.

2. Please give a detailed description of the jobs available as listed in the above
chart, i.e: job type, job qualifications, etc.

Construction positions will be created for the completion of the project and will
include the following:

Coleman A. Young Municipal Center 2 Woodward Avenue Suite 1340 Detroit. Michigan 48226
(313) 224-1245

 

The employment estimates of design, engineering, construction and administration have
been developed with our General Contractor, PCI, and architect, Farr Associates. The
professional jobs available will include architects, designers, engineers, consultants, and
construction management. We anticipate the design and construction team will staff the
majority of these positions internally and will hire out on an as needed basis. The non-
professional jobs available will mostly be to support staff for architect and general
contractors. The remaining professional and non-professional jobs will be staffed within
6001 Cass LLC via a property management company and include project management,
business administration and maintenance.

The general contractor will be responsible for hiring skilled and non-skilled labor by
using their own staff and hiring sub-contractors. These positions are typical
construction jobs experience in site management, demolition, concrete ?nishing,
carpentry, MEP installation, and other specialties. A site manager will also be needed.
Post construction professional jobs will include property management and maintenance.

Each of the retail spaces will need a business owner, a manager, and a few non-skilled
employees. Retail spaces occupied by the food service industry could have chefs,
restaurant managers, servers, and bussers.

3. Will this development cause any relocation that will create new Detroit residents?

With the estimated creation of over 500 of?ce jobs by prospective tenants the
development may attract new residents ?lling those positions. Also, the retail spaces
could attract businesses from outside the city looking to relocate into Detroit. These
businesses employees could also relocate to Detroit in order to be closer to work.

4. Has the developer reached out to any community groups to discuss the
project and/or any potential jobs?

Over the past two years, the developer has been working with community groups and
residents to introduce the project and discuss potential jobs including the Midtown
Detroit, D2D and DESC. The developer has also hosted numerous community meetings
with invites to local residents in order to introduce the project. 2x

5. When is construction slated to begin?
Construction began in 2019.

6. What is the expected completion date of construction?
This project was completed in 2020
