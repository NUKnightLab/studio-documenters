EXPLANATION
The purpose of the Surveillance Cameras Initiative is to improve the CHA’s property
management capabilities by leveraging state of the art surveillance technologies for improved
investment protection and operational security at CHA’s residential developments. The CHA
entered into an agreement with Siemens Building Technologies, Inc. in December 2009 for this
initiative. The vendor is currently doing field survey work for the assessment and design stages
of the project.
 
It is recommended that the Public Building Commission (PBC) serve in the capacity of Owner’s
Representative, Project Management, and Quality Control oversight for the CHA’s Surveillance
Camera Initiative. This initiative will require a significant coordination effort across the camera
vendor, Siemens Technologies, the CHA, and other city agencies, i.e. the City of Chicago’s
60 East Van Buren Street, 12th Floor Chicago, Illinois 60605 · (312) 913-7282· www.thecha.org

 Office of Emergency Management and Communications (OEMC). The PBC project team
brings a unique combination of experiences in these areas based on their ability to leverage
learning and synergies from other surveillance camera initiatives that are in progress across the
City of Chicago.
Based on the foregoing, it is in the best interest of the CHA that the Board of Commissioners
authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to enter into an Intergovernmental
Agreement with the City of Chicago, acting through its Public Building Commission, for
supporting project management of security camera systems for CHA Family and Senior
Portfolios in a total amount not-to-exceed $1,622,293.00 for sixteen (16) months.
