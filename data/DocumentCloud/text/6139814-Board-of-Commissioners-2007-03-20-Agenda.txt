Department of Justice, Office on Violence Against Women for the Cook County State’s Attorney’s
Target Abuser Call (TAC) Program. The TAC Program is a prosecution-based program that has become

secured by the Village, and cost responsibilities, including by the County. This amendment reflects
additional Federal funding in the amount of $393,571.00 secured by the village and allocated toward
the County’s improvement construction costs. In consideration of said additional funding, the Village
is relieved of any cost obligations to the County for water main and commuter lot construction that
are included as part of the County’s improvements. The County’s share of construction costs is
reduced from an estimated $3,820,000.00 to reflect said additional federal funding ($393,571.00 less

Re:

HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME Program)

respectfully request approval of a HOME Investment Partnerships Program loan to be used for the
rehabilitation of approximately seven (7) single-family homes for low- and very-low income households
in the City of Berwyn in County Board District #16. The project complies with the HOME Program
regulations and furthers the goals of the Five-Year Consolidated Community Development Plan approved
by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
The HOME Program loan of $300,000.00 will be made between the City of Berwyn and the County of
Cook. Approval of this loan will enable the City of Berwyn to expand their current Community
Development Block Grant (CDBG) funded Owner-Occupied Single-Family Rehabilitation Program.
Permanent liens are placed on the properties for the amount of the rehabilitation by the Village. After
rehabilitation is completed, the City of Berwyn then assigns the note, owner’s participation agreement,
and junior mortgage to Cook County. The Cook County HOME Program will recapture funds expended
on the projects when these homes are sold, transferred, or otherwise alienated and title is transferred.
I respectfully request approval of this project, and that the Chief Administrative Officer of the County of
Cook, or his designee, be authorized to execute on behalf of the County of Cook, any and all documents
necessary to further the project approved herein, including, but not limited to the Subgrantee Agreement
and any modifications thereto. The necessary documents will be reviewed and approved by the State’s
Attorney’s Office. Approval of this grant by this Honorable Body will permit staff to move forward with

PROPOSED ORDINANCE
ITEM #63
REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON CONTRACT COMPLIANCE #285681
Transmitting a Communication, dated March 13, 2007 from
ROBERTO MALDONADO, County Commissioner
I am submitting the following ordinance entitled, “Affirmative Action/Equal Employment Opportunity
Ordinance,” for the Main Agenda of the March 20, 2007 Cook County Board meeting. I will request that
this item be referred to the appropriate committee for further review and discussion.
Prior to the massive layoffs of Cook County employees as a result of the FY2007 Budget, both a
preliminary statistical analysis known as the “Cook County Employee Diversity Representation Report,”
and a subsequent four year retroactive analysis of the County’s work force (submitted for your review),
demonstrated a striking disparity in minority hiring among many of Cook County’s public offices. The
layoff of thousands of employees may have further eroded any slight improvements the County has made
recently in attempting to balance the diversity of the workforce.
As County government moves forward in restructuring its workforce, it is crucial that the County take
affirmative action consistent with law with respect to the hiring, retention and promotion of persons who
have historically been discriminated against because of race, ethnicity, and gender to prevent and
eliminate discrimination and to balance the County’s work force. To achieve this end, it is necessary for
the County to codify the affirmative action policy and procedure of the County and to give such policy
and procedure the full force of the County’s lawmaking powers.

AFFIRMATIVE ACTION/EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY ORDINANCE
PREAMBLE
WHEREAS, the County of Cook, Illinois is a home rule unit of local government pursuant to Article VII,
Section 6 (a) of the 1970 Illinois Constitution, and pursuant to the authority therein granted may exercise
any power and perform any function pertaining to its government and affairs; and
WHEREAS, equal employment opportunity is the law of the land, pursuant to Title VII of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964, as amended by the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972, codified at 42
U.S.C. § 2000e et seq.; and
WHEREAS, the policy of the County is to provide equal employment opportunities for persons from all
segments of the County community without regard to race, color, sex, age, religion, disability, national
origin, ancestry, sexual orientation, marital status, parental status, military discharge status, source of
income, housing, or any other protected category established by law, statute or ordinance; and
WHEREAS, the Equal Employment Opportunity Coordinating Council’s Policy Statement on
Affirmative Action, 41 C.F.R. § 60-3.17, notes in pertinent part: “On the one hand, vigorous enforcement
of the laws against discrimination is essential. But equally, and perhaps even more important are
affirmative voluntary efforts on the part of public employers to assure that positions in the public service
are genuinely and equally accessible to qualified persons, without regard to their sex, racial, or ethnic
characteristics. Without such efforts equal employment is no more than a wish;” and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Bureau of Human Resources currently operates in accordance with the
policy known as the “Cook County Equal Employment Opportunity Plan” for offices under the President;
and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners desires to codify this affirmative action policy
and procedure and to give such policy and procedure the full force of the County's lawmaking powers;
and
WHEREAS, the first step in the construction of any affirmative action plan is an analysis of the
employer’s work force to determine whether percentages of persons within race, ethnic, gender, or sexual
orientation groups in individual job classifications are substantially similar to the percentages persons
within those groups who are available in the relevant job market and who possess the basic job-related
qualifications; and
WHEREAS, when substantial disparities are found, the next step is to examine each element of the
overall selection process to identify elements which operate to exclude persons on the basis of race,
ethnicity, gender, or sexual orientation; and
WHEREAS, both a preliminary statistical analysis known as the “Cook County Employee Diversity
Representation Report,” and a subsequent four year retroactive analysis of the County’s work force,
substantiate a striking disparity in minority hiring among many of Cook County’s public offices.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
TRUTH IN JOB CLASSIFICATION
WHEREAS, the County’s budget process is greatly hampered by the lack of specificity in job titles,
duties and responsibilities; and
WHEREAS, the current employment schedules do not truly reflect an employees responsibilities making
it difficult to ascertain what specific services and duties they provide to taxpayers; and
WHEREAS, having an employees job title reflect the true parameters of their responsibilities would
allow for a more educated budget process; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board has seen many instances during the latest budget process of an
attempt to cut productive and important employees on the basis of their job title alone; and
WHEREAS, during the FY2007 budget process some of the County’s senior highway engineers were cut
because they were listed as “managers” which does not articulate to their responsibilities and scope of
their work; and
WHEREAS, additionally a “Project Director” with the Department of Planning and Development is in
fact the Director of Business and International Affairs, charged with establishing trade partnerships with
foreign countries; and
WHEREAS, in light of the responsibilities of the Board of Commissioners and the President’s Office, it
is imperative that every tool be available to get a clear and concise understanding of the County’s
personnel structure and needs.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners hereby
resolves that in addition to the current human resource schedules, necessary for payroll, that there also be
a tandem schedule which includes job titles for each employee that describe their true responsibilities and
duties; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that this new schedule, to be developed by the Bureau of Human
Resources, be presented for review by the Board of Commissioners and the President’s Office by July 1,
2007 in anticipation of the timely development of the FY2008 budget.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
U.S. COMMUNITIES GOVERNMENT PURCHASING ALLIANCE
WHEREAS, Cook County continues to look for responsible ways to cut government costs and become
more efficient and one cost cutting measure is to join a consortium of governments in purchasing supplies
to allow for maximum leverage and buying power; and
WHEREAS, U.S. Communities Government Purchasing Alliance (U.S. Communities), a division of U.S.
Communities Public Services Alliance, was designed in cooperation with an Advisory Board of local and

Officials International (ASBO), the National Association of Counties (NACo), the National Institute of
Governmental Purchasing (NIGP), the National League of Cities (NLC), and the United States
Conference of Mayors (USCM); and

agencies, school districts (K-12), higher education and non-profits nationwide by pooling the purchasing
power of over 87,000 public agencies through competitively solicited contracts for quality products
through lead public agencies; and
WHEREAS, today U.S. Communities contracts procure 1 billion dollars in products and services
annually fueled by the program's proven track record of providing public agencies unparalleled value with
over 16 contracts including everything from office supplies to roofing, janitorial products, and auto parts,
meeting the R.F.P. guidelines of the National Institute of Governmental Purchasing (NIGP) as well as
MBE and MWE guidelines; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Purchasing Department is currently working on a countywide office
supply contract for the County’s needs of over $4 million annually, and by participating in U.S.
Communities the County could save up to 40% over contracting alone for significant savings.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Purchasing Department will contact
U.S. Communities, and upon verification that the contract meets all Cook County requirements, and
pursuant to the authority granted in the Illinois Statutes and the Cook County Code is authorized to

Purchasing Alliance; and
