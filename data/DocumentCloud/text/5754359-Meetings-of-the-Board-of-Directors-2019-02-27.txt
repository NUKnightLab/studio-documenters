 Environmental Scan of Market, Best Practices, Trends
Innovative tools required to support our current business trend by providing value
Tele-psychiatry
More than 80 million millennials will comprise a larger pool of behavioral health. Treatment centers will
need to shift to appeal to this digitally connected population
• Tele-psychiatry as a tool to increase access to care, delivery of real-time services, fast and efficient which
decreases waiting lists and no-show rates, ultimately increase provider productivity and improved
quality care.
• In Ambulatory clinics
• In Corrections –Juvenile Treatment Detention Center (JDTC) and Cermak Health
• In Behavioral Health Consortium (BHC) agencies
• In Stroger Hospital
• Cerner tele-psychiatry platform build is required to support services across of CCH plus information
sharing rights and template building tools for documentation of services, scheduling, staffing as well as
the continual management.

FY 2020-2022 Strategic Planning Recommendations
Primary Care Physician and Behavioral Health Integration
• Phase 1 and 2 are complete

and responsibilities, develop tools to support workflow, algorithms and build consistency across all
ambulatory health centers, implement a culture of collaboration, identify best practices, institute
training programs, resolve State policies that hinder reimbursement, consider other value added
resources of Family/Marital Counseling to support areas that require more intensive therapies, form
multidisciplinary team approach to shared-care responsibility model
• Phase 4 requires testing and monitoring processes put in place and analyzing data, outcomes, identify
value added services and HEDIS (Health Effectiveness Data and Information Set) measures, fill gaps in
delivery of care, workflow obstacles-test and continue tracking and trending data
• Phase 5 -Full integration- Barriers resolution, gaps filled, measures support improved patient outcomes,
increase patient access to care, increased provider productivity, reduce reimbursement issues, improve
