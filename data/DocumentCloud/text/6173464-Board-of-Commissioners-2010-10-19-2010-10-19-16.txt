ITEM NO. C3

APPROVAL OF REVISED 2010 COMPREHENSIVE BUDGET
To the Honorable Board of Commissioners
RECOMMENDATION
It is recommended that the Board of Commissioners approve and adopt the 3rd Quarter Revised
2010 Comprehensive Budget.

EXPLANATION
The Chicago Housing Authority is required to submit for approval by the Board, a balanced
annual Comprehensive Budget detailing each of the following: General Fund, Section 8 NonMTW, HOPE VI and Other Funding Programs, and the use for these funds.
The FY2010 budgeted expenditures have been revised from $983,016,147 to $930,589,732,
resulting in a $52,426,415 decrease. The major changes by funding source are explained below:
•

General Fund. Total revenues and associated expenditures decreased by
$41,129,429 for a fund total of $761,533,289. The reduction is due to changes in the
cash flow schedules, as well as the carryover of various construction projects to
FY2011.

•

Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation (Non-MTW) Fund. Total revenues and
associated expenditures increased by $127,534 for a fund total of $8,003,263. The
increase reflects additional Mainstream dollars awarded for FY2010.

•

Hope VI. Total revenues and associated expenditures decreased by $9,995,715 for a
fund total of $31,888,709. The reduction is due to a change in the cash flow for both
Rockwell Gardens and Park Boulevard properties and delays in construction activities
at Cabrini Extension.

•

Other Funding. The total revenues and associated expenditures decreased by
$1,428,805 for a fund total of $129,164,471. This decrease is primarily due to the
changes in the cash flow schedule for the ARRA stimulus project.

The estimated sum of all revenues for fiscal year 2010 and the amount of the fiscal year 2010
Fund Balance available for appropriation in the fiscal year is equal to the estimated sum of all
expenditures to be made or incurred during the fiscal year and the amount of all unpaid liabilities
at the beginning of the fiscal year 2010.
Based upon the foregoing, it is in the best interest of the Chicago Housing Authority to adopt the
Revised 2010 Comprehensive Budget.
