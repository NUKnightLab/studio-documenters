PROPOSAL
2221 Wabash is an irregularly shaped vacant parcel with a small nineteenth-century house immediately south of a
similar irregularly-shaped parcel at 2225 Wabash. Both parcels were originally one lot and later split. The property is
located between Michigan Avenue and Dalzelle Street on the west side of the block. The applicant is proposing a
major renovation of the existing house, to include partial demolition of the rear (alley) section.
The applicant is seeking the Commission’s approval for the following scope:

STAFF OBSERVATIONS
In its current configuration, both 2221 and 2225 Wabash appear to be maintained as a single large parcel with no
delineation of the boundary between them. 2221 Wabash has a small, late nineteenth century “workers cottage” set
back to the extreme rear of the parcel, a setback of more than 80 feet. All of the 2225 Wabash parcel is currently
grass turf or planted beds, as is the front (street-adjacent) portion of 2221 Wabash, which measures about 18 feet in
width. The property (i.e., both parcels) appear to be well-maintained and 2221 Wabash appears to be occupied and in
fair to good condition.

2221 Wabash, current parcel boundaries per City of Detroit Parcel Viewer.

Originally, it appears from Sanborn maps dated 1897 that both parcels were a single parcel with two separate singlefamily dwellings erected thereon; a now demolished larger frame house (originally 289, later 2225) at the street front

 (northeast) corner of the lot, and a smaller rear house (originally 287, now 2221) at the rear or alley-adjacent
southwest corner. It is likely that the rear house was built first, and is among the oldest in the vicinity. Two frame
garages, presumably one for each home, are no longer extant. Both were originally single-family dwellings.

Red arrow indicates currently extant 2221 Wabash dwelling. All other structures on parcel have been removed.

1921 Sanborn map. 2225 Wabash has been converted to a two-family flat, as have the surrounding dwellings.2221
at the rear remains a single-family dwelling. Note another two-family flat has

 been inserted immediately to the north of 2225. This is 2231-33 Wabash, currently extant.

Upon designation as a historic district in late 1984, only 2221 Wabash was still extant. HDC staff has no record of
previous COA applications for either of these properties.

2221 Wabash, HDAB Designation Slide, circa March 1985.

Based on the designation slide, most of the current porch detailing is not original. Two turned wood columns have
replaced three simple square posts, and the porch balustrade does not match the earlier flat-sawn configuration.
Some apparently original 2/2 wooden windows have been replaced with 1/1 vinyl. With the exception of its
clapboard siding and wood trim, the house has lost much of the historic integrity it had when the district was
designated.
The applicant is proposing to remove the rearmost portion of 2221 Wabash, which is described in the application as
a later addition. This portion incorporates the existing bathroom and kitchen, and may have been added early in the
building’s history to provide additional plumbed facilities to a very modest-sized dwelling. Per the above, the
“addition” appears on the earliest available Sanborn map of the property, making its history difficult to discern.
Given the awkward geometry, it is staff’s opinion that the addition was a historic-age addition to the (slightly) earlier
original structure. In many cases such historic-age additions were not well integrated into the original structural
system.
The applicant has provided a report signed and sealed by a structural engineer, Alexander Lamb, P.E., attesting to
the condition of 2221 Wabash, specifically finding:





Heavy rot and section loss of timber beams in crawl space supporting ground floor level.
Cause is likely a result of water exposure and insect infestation
Collapse of roof sheathing and deterioration to roof framing members
Partial collapse of the east section of the house

 


Settlements of foundations in the range of 4” to 6”
Spalling/crumbling of foundation elements

The conclusion of the structural engineer is that the structure should be demolished due to the “severity, nature,
ubiquity, and extreme repair costs associated with the deteriorations visually identified.”
The applicant does not however seek to demolish the entire structure, but instead remove the “addition,” make
various interior configuration changes, structural improvements and alterations, and erect two modern additions to
the rear and north side of the building. The proposed additions will expand the building’s footprint from
approximately 450 SF to 650 SF. The newly proposed north addition features a dramatic raking roofline which takes
cues from the original roof while preserving its original reading, overtopping it and extending the building mass to
the north.
The front (east-facing) elevation of the new north addition is proposed to be brick punctuated with two 4/4 wood
windows. The brick materiality of the addition is somewhat at odds with the more typical frame construction
predominant for single-family homes in the district and specifically called out in the Elements of Design, as well as
inconsistent with the typical relationship between historic dwellings and additions in Detroit (i.e., brick is rarely used
in additions to frame houses, with the notable exception of commercial storefront additions built towards the street in
front of older frame houses in the pre-war era). Typical residential additions were finished in siding, panels, or
stucco. The brick is proposed to be gray or black, which, along with the small setback in plane, will recede in
deference to the historic core. Note that there are several multi-family brick buildings in the district, including
nearby on Wabash.
The existing historic clapboard siding and wood trim is proposed to be repaired and painted. Siding on the addition,
in addition to the brick, is proposed to be Hardie board. A metal panel roof is proposed for the new addition, while
the historic core will be reshingled. Related landscape and fence improvements appear to be appropriate.

ELEMENTS OF DESIGN
The applicant has provided a narrative (appended to this report) addressing how the proposed work complies with
the district’s elements of design.
(1) Height. Most residential buildings in the district range from one (1) story to two and one-half (2½) stories
tall. However, an apartment building on Porter Street and a multi-unit building on Fourteenth Street are
comprised of four (4) stories each. Commercial and industrial buildings range in height from one (1) to five (5)
stories tall; the Victorian commercial buildings are between two (2) and three (3) stories tall. Institutional
buildings range from one (1) to three (3) stories.
(2) Proportion of buildings' front facades. Proportion varies in the district, depending on the age, style and type
of building. One-story workers' cottages are slightly wider than tall to the peak of the gable; two-story pre-1880's
residential buildings are generally taller than wide. Side-by-side duplexes are either wider than tall or square in
proportion; terraces or attached rowhouses, when grouped together, are substantially wider than tall, although
the individual units may appear taller than wide. Queen Anne style residences are generally slightly wider than
tall or as tall as wide to the eaves of their roofs. The church buildings in the district are taller than wide, and
other institutional buildings are generally wider than tall. Victorian commercial buildings are generally taller
than wide, while newer commercial buildings in the district may be wider than tall. Multi-story industrial
buildings in the district are usually taller than wide, while one (1) or (2) story industrial buildings are wider than
tall. The fire station on Bagley Street at Sixth Street is wider than tall.
(3) Proportion of openings within the facades. Window openings are usually taller than wide, but there are also
square openings and transom window openings which are wider than tall. Several windows are sometimes

 grouped into a wider than tall combination. Window openings are almost always subdivided, the double-hung
sash is the most common window type. Its sashes are generally further divided by muntins, resulting in lights
arranged two-over-two, four-over-four, or six-over-six. There is a great variety of sizes and shapes of window
openings in the Queen Anne style buildings, while there is a more regular arrangement in the earlier pre-1880's
buildings. Facades have approximately five (5) percent to seventy-five (75) percent of their area glazed;
residential buildings generally fall into the thirty (30) to thirty-five (35) percent range.
(4) Rhythm of solids to voids in front facades. Pre-1880's buildings in the Italianate and Greek Revival styles
display a great regularity in the rhythm of solids to voids, with one (1) opening placed directly above the other.
The post-1880's Queen Anne style buildings exhibit a greater freedom, with their bay windows and combinations
of windows in gables.
(5) Rhythm of spacing of buildings on streets. The original pattern of spacing of buildings on streets was that of
houses placed very close together. Most houses were situated on twenty-five (25) foot lots, the major exceptions
being the Lognon Farm where most lots were thirty-three (33) feet wide and where a house was infrequently
placed on an undivided fifty-foot (50) lot. Houses on narrow lots were usually placed on or closer to a side
property line, providing more space on one side of the building. Rhythm has been interrupted by vacant lots due
to demolition of buildings almost throughout the district.
(6) Rhythm of entrance and/or porch projections. Most houses in the district have projecting front porches,
usually on one (1) side of the front facade and sometimes wrapping around to the side, especially on corner lots.
Some Victorian houses have a secondary porch at the side.
(7) Relationships of materials. The great majority of buildings in the district are wood frame structures originally
clad in clapboard with wooden skirting or brick foundations. Some have more recently been sheathed in
aluminum, vinyl or asphalt siding, and original skirting has often been replaced with metal skirting or concrete
block foundations. Window sash and functional and decorative trim are in wood. Wood is frequently the only
material below the eaves of a building, except for the window glass. There are some brick residential buildings
in the district, the majority of these being duplexes and multi-unit dwellings. The small commercial buildings,
the industrial buildings, the fire station, and most of the institutional buildings in the district are brick. Roofing
material is primarily asphalt shingles, although a few wood shingle roofs and one (1) slate roof exist in the
district.
(8) Relationship of textures. The most common relationship of textures in the district is that of clapboard to the
smooth surface of wood trim. Aluminum or vinyl siding of the same width as the original clapboard siding that
does not alter the relationship of the siding to the functional trim and architectural detail of the building can
sometimes contribute to textural relationships. Porches are usually in wood, although some have brick piers.
Steps are either in wood, which was the original material, or concrete. Where wooden shingles, carvings, or
other decorative wooden details exist, they add significantly to the textural interest of the building. Asphalt
shingles or rolled asphalt roofs generally have little textural interest, while wood shingles has considerable
interest. Detailed brickwork on brick buildings contributes to textural interest when it exists.
(9) Relationships of colors. Paint colors in the district generally relate to style. Earlier buildings usually display
muted colors, such as earth tones and shades of yellow, while Italianate and Queen Anne style buildings
sometimes display richer and darker colors, such as browns, golds, grays, and blues. Common trim colors
include; shades of cream, yellow, gray, brown, green, and white. Window sashes are frequently painted white,
deep red, brown and gray. Asphalt siding is either red or brown brick color. Wood shingle roofs are a weathered
cedar tone, while most asphalt shingled roofs are either in light colors, such as sand, light gray, light brown, or
light green, or darker colors, such as dark gray, black, or dark green.

 (10) Relationship of architectural details. These generally relate to style, and the styles in Corktown run from
early Victorian to late Victorian and Colonial Revival. The earliest houses in the Greek Revival and Venacular
styles contain a minimal amount of architectural detail. Functional detail includes the wood cornerboards, wide
cornices with brackets supporting the eaves, and window frames and sills. More ornate details of the Italianate or
Queen Anne styles include paired brackets, window and porch hoods, wooden carvings, sunburst patterns,
fishscale shingles, and verge-boards in gables, and spindlework on balustraded porches. Some buildings,
especially those on Church Street, have leaded glass windows. The late Victorian commercial buildings
sometimes have decorative cornice work, corbeltables, and pediments or parapet walls. In general, Corktown is
rich in its diversity and quality of architectural styles and detail.
(11) Relationship of roof shapes. Pitched roofs with frontal gables predominate in the district, although pitched
roofs with side-facing gables, hip roofs, and hip roofs with intersecting gables also exist. More complex roof
shapes occur primarily on Church Street. Commercial buildings generally have flat roofs. St. Peter's Episcopal
Church has a steeply pitched roof with frontal gables. Rear additions to houses, such as kitchens, frequently have
shed roofs.
(12) Walls of continuity. The major wall of continuity is created by the buildings, with their fairly uniform
setbacks within blocks. Mature and recently planted trees along the tree lawns create a secondary wall of
continuity.
(13) Relationship of significant landscape features and surface treatments. The typical treatment of individual
properties is a shallow flat front lawn area in grass turf, subdivided by a concrete walk leading to the front
entrance and sometimes a concrete walk leading to the side entrance. Short concrete walks from the curbline to
the public sidewalk are also frequent in the district. Foundation plantings and evergreens are typical plantings in
front yards. Hedges are occasionally planted along the side lot lines in the front yards and sometimes along the
front lot line; this treatment usually occurs on corner lots when it exists. Chain link fences predominate as rear
yard enclosures; few continue into the front yards. Wood posts and rails with wire mesh are also common fence
types found in the district, and a few of these fences enclose the front yard as well as the rear. Many rear garages
with alley entrances exist. Concrete side driveways, where they exist interrupt the succession of front yards and
are not the original treatment of the property. The curbs are cut red-brown stone in the majority of the district,
with the primary exceptions of Porter Street, Labrosse Street, Leverette Street, and Michigan Avenue. Alleys in
the district are paved in concrete. Vacant lots are either paved-over or gravelled as parking lots or are unkept.
Light fixtures are elevated on wooden telephone poles in most parts of the district.
(14) Relationship of open space to structures. Open space occurs in the form of vacant land, a playground, and
parking lots, and frequently occurs on corner lots. Open space in the form of front yards to buildings is generally
very shallow. Some buildings are situated on the front lot line or very close to it; this usually occurs on northsouth streets east of Rosa Parks Boulevard, and on Porter Street.
(15) Scale of facades and facade elements. The majority of buildings in the district are small in scale, with the
exception of multi-story industrial buildings and apartment buildings, which are medium to large in scale and
therefore do not comply with the original scale of the neighborhood. Facade elements, such as bays, steep roofs,
gables, and/or verandas, are moderate in scale. Details within these elements are generally small in scale.
(16) Directional expression of front elevations. One-story residences are usually slightly wider than tall but their
directional expression is vertical due to the gable of the steeply pitched roof. Two-story, Italianate and Greek
Revival single-family residences are vertical in directional expression, while duplexes in those styles are usually
neutral. Two-story Queen Anne buildings are either neutral in directional expression or have vertically expressed
front facades, depending on the projection of gables and/or roof slopes. Terraces are horizontal in directional
expression, churches are emphatically vertical, and industrial buildings are either vertically or horizontally

 expressed, depending on the number of stories. Individual Victorian commercial buildings are usually vertical
but may form a commercial row that is horizontal.
(17) Rhythm of building setbacks. Setbacks vary from area to area within the district, although they are usually
consistent within blocks. In general, buildings have very shallow front yards, although buildings may relate to
the building lines differently due to porch projections and pays where they exist. Buildings on the north-south
streets and corners are very close to the front lot lines. Some industrial and commercial buildings are situated
directly on the front lot line.
(18) Relationship of lot coverage. Lot coverage ranges from zero (0) percent to one hundred (100) percent, the
average residential coverage being approximately forty (40) percent. Industrial buildings are in the upper range,
as are some corner stores and some houses on north-south cross streets.
(19) Degree of complexity within the facade. Early buildings are simple and straightforward. Queen Anne style
buildings are more complex in massing and detail but are not overly complex.
(20) Orientation, vistas, overviews. In general, buildings East of Rosa Parks Boulevard are oriented toward the
east-west streets, with Trumbull Avenue, Eighth Street and Sixth Street being exceptions. Buildings west of
Rosa Parks Boulevard are most often oriented toward the north-south streets. Garages are oriented toward the
alleys. Commercial buildings are located on corner lots and on Michigan Avenue and sometimes on corner lots
within the residential areas. There are vistas of downtown Detroit and Tiger Stadium from the Corktown District.
The general overview is that of small-scaled mixed-use neighborhood with major thoroughfares and major
landmarks, such as Tiger Stadium, Michigan Central Station, and Most Holy Trinity R.C. Church surrounding
the district.
(21) Symmetric or asymmetric appearance. Most buildings in the district are asymmetrical in appearance, but
result in balanced compositions.
(22) General environmental character. The Corktown Historic District, with its narrow lots, shallow front yards,
and small-scaled buildings, has a low-density, urban, mixed use character of a pre-automobile city. Its original
cohesiveness has been eroded by housing demolition over the years. Anchored by Tiger Stadium on the north,
Michigan Central Station and Roosevelt Park on the west, Most Holy Trinity Church and the John C. Lodge
Expressway on the east, and the West Side Industrial Park on the south, the neighborhood is set apart from its
surrounding environment, resulting in a definable community in the shadows of Downtown Detroit.

RECOMMENDATION
The proposed addition adds reasonable space to the area of a very small house while clearly delineating the historic
core and preserving historic materials that characterize the property. Remaining original features and finishes,
including the nineteenth-century clapboard siding and trim, are proposed to be preserved and repaired. While the
proposed north side addition, especially, is very contemporary, the sloped roof, projecting eaves, and other gestures
are generally in keeping with the district context and elements of design, and are deferential while remaining
distinct, serving almost as a visual bracket. Staff therefore recommends that the Commission approve the proposed
demolition, additions, and exterior alterations, as the proposed changes appear to be appropriate per Secretary of the
Interior Standards 5, 9, and 10; however, staff does recommend a condition that the use of brick on the addition be
reduced to the foundation only.

RE: 2221 Wabash St – New Construction Historic District Commission Submission
2221 Wabash is a mid-block lot on the west side of Wabash nearly equidistant from Michigan Avenue to
the North and Dalzelle Street to the South. The proposed structure is a single-family home comprised of
a two-bedroom unit and is approximately 1112 GSF. The existing structure is approximately 460 GSF
and the two additions are 247 GSF and 405 GSF respectively.
This project faces several challenges; because of the unique configuration of the lot and its connection
to 2225 Wabash. The owner intends to renovate 2221Wabash in parallel with 2225 Wabash. The goal of
this project was to preserve as much of the original structure as feasible. Bases on our assessment
attached; conducted by the project structural engineer we are able to preserve the original portion of
the home. In consideration of the historic character of the home and the neighborhood this project and
the design for 2225 Wabash propose a modern renovation, with new construction that seek to draw from
historic context and design as inspiration while maintaining the integrity of neighborhood’s historic
fabric.
The home has a traditional gable end with a cover porch entry. Where existing materials remain, we will
paint and repair as necessary. New materials have been listed on the attached elevations and will consist
of a mixture of Brick, Lap Board Wood Siding and metal panel for the roof.
1. Height:
The proposed structure is a one-story structure, with a total height of approximately 20’-2” above
grade. This height is constant with the adjacent properties.
2. Proportion of Front Façade:
The front façade of the proposed structure is approximately 28’-0” wide, making it wider than it is
tall, with a lower rectangular proportion. A portion of the front façade is pushed further back to the
west to maintain the original elevation as the primary focus of front façade.
3. Proportion of Openings:
The windows proposed for the structure are generally wood casement style. Individual windows are
taller than they are wide and grouped together to form larger areas of glazing. On the front façade,
the openings make up about 20% of the façade.

 4. Rhythm of Solid to Void:
Openings in the facades of the proposed structure are regular and ordered, like the existing Greek
revival homes on either side of the proposed structure. Individual windows and groups of windows
are placed to be considerate of adjacency between new façade and existing.
5. Rhythm of Spacing of Buildings:
The lot has a width of approximately 18’-0”at the street, and it is anticipated that this space in front
of the building will remain open. The proposed structure has a significant setback from the East
property line approximately 82’ from the property line to the front facade. The close placement to
the existing house to the south is consistent with the close spacing between other existing homes on
the block. The close placement to the proposed home to north is also consistent with spacing of
homes in the neighborhood.
6. Rhythm of Entrance and/or front porch projections:
The proposed structure features an existing asymmetric front porch entry, which is to remain. The
covered porch provides a visual break in the tall gable end wall and creates visual interest with its
railing and shed roof.
7. Materials:
The proposed structure is comprised of wood framing with a concrete foundation, and a metal
standing-seam roof on the new portions, existing roof area will be re-shingled. The majority of the
facades are clad in wood ship-lap siding new and existing is lap siding. Trim used around the
windows will be wood painted to accent the existing structure. Brick is used as a base element for
transition between the existing structure and new additions.
8. Textures:
Texture is at play in the relationship between the lap siding, ship-lap wood siding, brick, and smooth
metal accent and trim panels. The majority of the front façade is clad in horizontally oriented wood
siding to provide continuity between the existing siding and new.
9. Colors:
The color palette of the proposed structure has been kept neutral and natural in order to blend in
with the existing homes on the block. The brick, metal panels and roof, and painted wood siding are
all within a gray-scale pallet.
10. Architectural Details:
The architectural details of the proposed structure are very simple in order to complement the
existing modest homes on the block and the addition which we are connecting to. The overall
massing and roof shape are similar to adjacent historic homes, while the clean simplified detailing of
the addition is more contemporary. In order to match the level of detail and visual interest of the
existing homes, a concept of layering and texture is used to create depth and hierarchy in the
facades. The goal is to establish the existing structure as the primary focus and allow the addition to

 have a supporting role.

11. Roof Shapes:
Similar to many existing homes on the block, the proposed structure features a simple roof line with
a single ridge running down the center of the structure, and front-facing gables. With an attempt to
balance the existing roof line with the roof line of the addition the roofs have been offset in the
vertical to create a break between the existing and proposed.
12. Wall of Continuity (setbacks):
The front setback of the proposed structure is not at all similar to adjacent properties and because of
this we are challenged with maintaining the street façade continuity. This home was established
before many of its neighbors existed and because of the age of the home it has a very unique site
arrangement that has been altered at time to accommodate its adjacent neighbors. The home that
previously was sited on 2225 Wabash influenced the ‘L” shape to lot that we currently have and
while that home no longer existing, we are left with a very unique lot with a lot of historic character.
13. Landscape Features:
The front lawn of the proposed structure is grass turf, consistent with adjacent properties. More
decorative bushes and flowering plants will be included along the north and south property lines. A
simple brick foot path extends from the sidewalk to the east façade to provide access to the unit.
14. Open space:
This directly is approximately 18’-0” of frontage along Wabash street. It is planned that this narrow
front portion of the lot will remain open in the future for street access
15. Scale of Facades/Façade Elements:
The overall structure is a similar scale to the existing homes on the block. The front elevation is fairly
simple with few façade elements. Window groupings are always in the same plane as the overall
façade. Window groupings are generally 2 windows wide and consistent in shape between the new
and existing facades, and account for approximately one-quarter of the overall façade width. Solid
walls have been used where we are in close proximity to adjacent parcels.
16. Directional Expression of Front Elevation:
The directional expression of the front elevation is generally horizontal. The south portion of the
front façade has the existing covered entry and is clad in the existing siding. The remaining portion
of the façade is clad in brick and horizontally oriented wood ship-lap siding, painted. This
composition expresses the width of the front façade, emphasizing its vertical split between the
existing and proposed additions

 17. Rhythm of Setbacks:
The front setback in 82’ because of the location of the existing structure the building has minimal
setbacks on the rear and sides the existing location of the building will require variances for the side
and rear yard set back.s
18. Lot Coverage:
a. Lot Size: 3383 Square Feet
b. Building Footprint: 1112
c. Percentage of lot Coverage: 32.9%
19. Degree of Complexity in Façade:
The proposed structure is very simple in massing and façade complexity. The façade uses a simple
palate of 4 materials, organized in a way to provide hierarchy, depth and interest without relying on
additional detail and applied architectural elements.
20. Orientation/Vistas/Views:
The long axis of the proposed structure is oriented east-west with the front of the structure facing
Wabash street. Bedrooms are placed at the rear of the building, while the living space is organized
to the front of the home, because most of the green space for the lot is located in the front yard the
home has a focus on connecting living space with that are for its primary exterior use and connection
to the neighborhood.
21. Symmetric or asymmetric appearance:
The appearance of the proposed structure is asymmetric to complement existing asymmetric homes
on the block. Windows on the front façade are aligned in groups of two with the existing and
proposed matching each other. The additions connection the existing and with the break in plane
between the two facades helps reinforce the asymmetry of the home.
22. General Character:
Corktown is made up of modestly detailed small-scaled homes on narrow lots creating a dense
walkable neighborhood. The proposed structure follows the simple massing and closely spaced
arrangement precedent set by the existing adjacent homes. The materials used for the proposed
structure speak to the textural quality of the existing homes with the use of wood ship-lap siding and
brick. More contemporary materials such as the standing seam metal roof and metal trim panels
speak to the longevity of the neighborhood and the notion that Corktown houses are built to last.
The homes in Corktown were built over various periods of time, and are examples of many
architectural styles. What makes the neighborhood cohesive is the attention to scale, proportion,
and quality in each home regardless of style. While the proposed structure utilizes some
contemporary elements, the overall scale, massing, and textural quality are inspired by and designed
to complement the overall Corktown character.

RE:

2221 Wabash – Structural Condition Evaluation

Project No. 19-1005
Dear Mr. Flintoff:
In accordance with your request, we have completed our evaluation process of the above captioned project on May
23, 2019.
An evaluation of the structural deteriorations visually identified was performed on 05/22/2019 at which time the
main structural framing members were reviewed. The structure consists of wood floor and roof decks supported on
2x4 stud walls which are supported on shallow foundations. At the time of the visual evaluation, significant structural
deteriorations were observed in many locations throughout the house. The main issues identified are as follows:
Heavy rot and section loss of timber beams in crawl space supporting ground floor level.
Cause is likely a result of water exposure and insect infestation
Collapse of roof sheathing and deterioration to roof framing members
Partial collapse of the east section of the house
Settlements of foundations in the range of 4” to 6”
Spalling/crumbling of foundation elements
The rotten framing members supporting the ground floor level cannot be easily replaced without disturbing already
precarious structural conditions resulting from the deteriorations. Further, the foundation settlements cannot be
mitigated given the current condition of the shallow foundations. Significant underpinning and stabilization would
be required in order to not cause partial collapse or additional settlements to the previously mentioned adjacent
framing conditions.
Based on the severity, nature, ubiquity, and extreme repair costs associated with the deteriorations visually
identified, it is our recommendation to demolish the structure.
If you have any questions regarding the contents of this report, please do not hesitate to contact our office.
Sincerely,

Alexander Lamb, Ph.D., P.E.
