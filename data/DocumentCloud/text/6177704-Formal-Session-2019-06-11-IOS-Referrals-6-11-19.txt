pay range for the following new classi?cations:

Site CoordinatcL $27,304 - $35,496 
45?15-22 Site Leader . $9,222 - $27,778_ 

_45?3_ i_ Program Leader 

 

The above recommendations are at the request of Jan Anderson, Director General Services.

These positions are critical to the after school programs within the Recreation Division to distinguish the
differences in requirements and schedules between employees of the recreation centers and employees of
the after school programs. All three jobs are tasked with different levels of responsibility involved in
operating an after school program location. The State of Michigan has speci?c criteria that each after
school employee must meet that are not required for employees operating the recreation centers. Currently
these incumbents are assigned the same job titles as the individuals within the recreation centers. Per the
rules of their union, all employees in the same job must be offered the same hours. This could cause issues
during school breaks and summer.

To determine the appropriate salary range for the new classi?cation, a market study was conducted with
municipalities and organizations that had comparable positions. Based on the results, Classification and
Compensation recommends the salary ranges shown above, subject to City Council approval.
