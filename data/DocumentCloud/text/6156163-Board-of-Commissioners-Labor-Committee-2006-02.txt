PROPOSED RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, the United States has an undocumented population of eleven million
immigrants, including half a million in Illinois, more than 300,000 of whom reside in
Cook County; and
WHEREAS, U.S. citizen children who are born to a U.S. citizen or legal resident
parent and an undocumented parent who faces deportation have become innocent
victims of our inhumane immigration laws; and
WHEREAS, hard working immigrants who are employed in the underground system of
undocumented labor, which has existed for over a century in this nation with the willing
participation of business, religious and community institutions and many sectors of
government, are being deported and separated from their U.S. citizen families; and

WHEREAS, 35 Illinois families, primarily from Cook County, have joined together on
behalf of their 100 U.S. citizen children and U.S. citizen spouses to fight for the right of
family reunification, waging a public campaign known as “La Familia Latina Unida” to
save their families and other families throughout the nation from being torn apart by
our broken immigration laws; and
WHEREAS, Congressman Bobby Rush, with the support of Congressman Luis
Gutierrez, Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky, and Congressman John Conyers, has
introduced private bill HR 3856 to confer legal status on the mothers or fathers of
these 35 families who have suffered, or will suffer, irreparable emotional and financial
harm, and to allow for their permanent unification; and
WHEREAS, HR 3856 represents a consensus on the protection and preservation of
family unity in the ongoing debate on the comprehensive reform of U.S. immigration
laws.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that we, the President and the Members of
the Cook County Board of Commissioners do hereby support comprehensive
immigration reform that will reunite families and memorialize the Illinois Congressional
delegation to urge the passage of private bill HR 3856 in the U.S. House, and to urge
the introduction and passage in the U.S. Senate and its signing by President George
W. Bush; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a suitable copy of this Resolution be delivered to
the President of the United States, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the
President of the Senate, the Majority and Minority Leaders of the Senate, the Minority
Leader of the House, and the Illinois Congressional Delegation.
