Re: HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME Program)
requesting approval of a HOME Investment Partnerships Program grant to be used for the
rehabilitation of approximately 22 single-family homes for low- and very-low income

Bridgeview, Chicago Ridge, Forest Park, Franklin Park, Hillside, Hometown, LaGrange,
LaGrange Park, Lyons, Maywood, Melrose Park, Northlake, Schiller Park, Stone Park and
Summit. The project complies with the HOME Program regulations and furthers the goals of
the Five-Year Consolidated Community Development Plan (approved by the U.S. Department
of Housing and Urban Development on October 17, 2000).
The HOME Program ffiaiT filfil!1 of $1,000,000.00 will be made eet:weeR the to West Suburban
Neighborhood Preservation Agency (WSNPA) and the County of Cook. WSNPA has
previously been a successful participant with HOME Program aR4 from Community
Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds. Approval of this grant will enable WSNPA to
continue their Owner-occupied Single-family Rehabilitation Program. Pennanent liens are
placed on the properties for the amount of the rehabilitation by the West Suburban
Neighborhood Preservation Agency. After rehabilitation is completed, WSNPA then assigns
the Note, Owner' s Participation Agreement, and Junior Mortgage to Cook County. The Cook
County HOME Program will recapture funds expended on the projects when these homes are
sold, transferred, or otherwise alienated and title is transferred.
I respectfully request approval of this project, and that the Chief Administrative Officer of the
County of Cook, or his designee, be authorized to execute on behalf of the County of Cook,
any and all documents necessary to further the project approved herein, including, but not
limited to the Subgrantee Agreement and any modifications thereto.

DEPARTMENT OF PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT, by Gwendolyn D. Clemons,

Re: HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME Program)
respectfully requesting approval to amend a HOME award granted on April 18, 2000, to allow
for the rehabilitation of a Community Integrated Living Arrangement (CILA) for eight special
needs persons on Owl Drive in Rolling Meadows owned by Clearbrook. The Cook County
Board awarded Clearbrook $600,000.00 for the acquisition of five single-family homes for
thirty developmentally disabled persons. Of the $600,000.00 awarded, Clearbrook has
acquired three single-family homes, providing housing for 18 special needs persons. They
have expended $360,000.00 from their committed HOME dollars with $240,000.00 remaining.
Clearbrook desires to rebuild and construct the CILA on Owl Drive because of dangerous
Stachbotrys mold present in the house and is requesting the full amount of $240,000.00 to be
used to construct one home for eight residents. Preliminary construction costs are estimated at
$360,000.00. Clearbrook plans to secure a mortgage with Harris Bank for approximately
$120,000.00 in order to fill the gap between HOME funds and actual construction costs.
Respectfully requesting approval of the amendment of the previously approved use of HOME
funds, and that the Chief Administrative Officer of the County of Cook, or his designee, be
authorized to execute on behalf of the County of Cook any and all documents necessary to

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 19, 2005

The Optional Plan allows employees to contribute an additional 3% of current salary and for past service
prior to when the Optional contribution began an additional 3% of the salary earned, plus interest. For
each year that the employee contributes the extra 3% contribution, they earn an enhanced benefit of an
additional I% of final average salary subject to maximum annuity of 80%. This assumes that the
employee is at least age 60, or if under 60 has credit for more than 30 years of service.
Were the Optional Plan to be extended another 3 years, based on the Actuarial Impact Statement, the
unfunded liability of the Fund would increase by an additional $120,000,000. Submitted is a copy of the
Actuarial Impact Statement.

of drains in these bathroom areas was identified as an existing building element that is not in

implement the change is to allow ERS Enterprises/Oppidan to prepare the plans based on their
familiarity with the buildings. Additionally, this amendment provides for conceptual design
work for areas of rescue assistance, for alterations to nursing stations at Oak Forest Hospital of
Cook County and Provident Hospital of Cook County, and for additional construction

municipalities: Barrington, Bartlett, Buffalo Grove, Elk Grove Village, Elmwood Park, Glenview,
Hanover Park, Hoffman Estates, Morton Grove, Niles, Park Ridge, Prospect Heights and Rolling

rehabilitation by Northwest Housing Partnership. After rehabilitation is completed, NWHP then assigns
the Note, Owner' s Participation Agreement, and Junior Mortgage to Cook County. The Cook County
HOME Program will recapture funds expended on the projects when these homes are sold, transferred, or
otherwise alienated and title is transferred.
I respectfully request approval of this project, and that the Chief Administrative Officer of the County of
Cook, or his designee, be authorized to execute on behalf of the County of Cook, any and all documents
necessary to further the project approved herein, including, but not limited to the Subgrantee Agreement

Your Committee has considered the following item and upon adoption of this report, the recommendation
is as follows:
269604

COMMUNICATION FROM COUNTY COMMISSIONER, CARL R. HANSEN, dated
February 14, 2005.
Enclosed is an added starter for the February 15, 2005 meeting of the Cook County Board of
Commissioners. It is recommended that this new item be referred to the Committee on
Finance. It recommends consideration of the following issues as alternatives to balance the
FY 2005 Budget without increasing taxes:
•

•
•
•

An upward revision of fee revenue estimates in the FY2005 budget of approximately
$23,000,000 which is close to the minimum difference between Actual and Estimated Fee
Revenues in 200 I .
Reductions in the recommended appropriation for Constitutional Officers for a savings of
$14,658,038.
The deletion of the under funded Full Time Equivalent positions (FTEs) in the FY2005
budget for a savings of $25,961,064.
A two percent reduction in the recommended appropriation for all the offices under the
President for a savings of $23,569,408.

The latter two items are not mutually exclusive since the under funded FTEs account for part
of the appropriation for offices under the president.

*Referred to the Finance Committee 02/15/05.
**Commissioner Hansen has requested this item be received and filed.

A RESOLUTION TO DEVELOP CONSTITUTIONAL CONTRACT SET-ASIDE
PROGRAM FOR MINORITY AND WOMEN-OWNED BUSINESSES (PROPOSED
RESOLUTION). Submitting a Proposed Resolution sponsored by Forrest Claypool, County
Commissioner; Co-Sponsored by Mike Quigley and Larry Suffredin, County Commissioners.
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
RESOLUTION TO DEVELOP CONSTITUTIONAL CONTRACT SETASIDE PROGRAM FOR MINORITY AND WOMEN-OWNED
BUSINESSES
WHEREAS, opening the doors of economic opportunity to minority and women-owned
businesses should be a top priority of County government; and
WHEREAS, Cook County government spends hundreds of millions of dollars annually for
goods and services; and
WHEREAS, recent revelations show that Cook County issues a mere seven percent of its
construction contracts annually to minority businesses including a mere one percent to
African-American companies and one percent to women-owned businesses; and
WHEREAS, Cook County government serves a diverse population that is approximately 26
percent African-American, 20 percent Hispanic, and five percent Asian, according to the U.S.
Census Bureau; and
WHEREAS, Cook County government should reflect to the extent possible the diversity of
its citizens; and
WHEREAS, Cook County government can use its vast contracting opportunities to assist in
the development and growth of small and minority-owned businesses; and
WHEREAS, the City of Chicago, the Chicago Park District and other government agencies
have proven successful in awarding high percentages of government contracts to minority
and women-owned businesses; and
WHEREAS, court decisions have required a higher standard of proof of past discrimination
in order to justify set-aside programs, as well as more narrowly-tailored remedies for such
discrimination; and
WHEREAS, to meet those new standards requires an extensive and sophisticated factfinding and legal process.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that Cook County Board President John H.
Stroger, Jr. appoint a special task force charged with developing standards necessary to meet
recent court decisions and reconstitute Cook County's set-aside program for minority and
women-owned businesses; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board, upon the recommendation of
the President, hire an outside expert experienced and skilled in establishing the legal steps,
infonnation and fact gathering, public processes and other measures necessary to create and
forward to the Cook County Board of Commissioners a contract set-aside program that meets
constitutional muster; and

1389

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 19, 2005

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the contract compliance division of the finance
department of Cook County shall, in consultation with the purchasing agent, develop a targetmarket program for small or economically-disadvantaged businesses as a first step in opening
new opportunities for the many minority and women-owned businesses that would qualify,
including those small companies not owned by minorities.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the task force report to the Cook County Board within
90 days as to its progress and present a timeline for presenting a new and legal contract setaside ordinance to the Cook County Board of Commissioners for its consideration, as well as
other recommended steps to encourage and support greater participation by minority and
women-owned businesses in County contracting.

*Referred to the Committee on Contract Compliance on 10/19/04.
Vice Chairman Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Peraica, moved to receive and file
Communication No. 267845. T he motion carried.
270506

A RESOLUTION TO CONDUCT AN OUTSIDE INDEPENDENT AUDIT OF ALL
CURRENT MINORITY BUSINESS ENTERPRISE/WOMEN' S BUSINESS ENTERPRISE
(MBE/WBE) CONTRACTS TO DETERMINE THE LEGITIMACY OF THEIR CURRENT
MBE/WBE STA TUS (PROPOSED RESOLUTION). Submitting a Proposed Resolution
sponsored by Mike Quigley, County Commissioner.
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, the 2000 Census detennined that minorities account for 52.4 percent of the
population of Cook County; and
WHEREAS, minority-owned businesses with paid employees constitute only 14.5 percent of
the total number of fim1s, 2.9 percent of total business sales and receipts, 4.8 percent of total
employees, and 3.6 percent of total payroll in Cook County, according to the 1997 Economic
Census; and
WHEREAS, women-owned businesses with paid employees constitute only 16 percent of
the total number of firms, 4.1 percent of total business sales and receipts, 7.7 percent of total
employees, and 5.7 percent of total payroll in Cook County, according to the 1997 Economic
Census; and
WHEREAS, this dramatic under-representation of minorities and women in the economic
life of Cook County is a serious socioeconomic problem; and
WHEREAS, the certification of women and minority business enterprises was originally
established in order to help women and minority-owned businesses by increasing their
opportunities and ending the disparity in contracts awarded to women and minority owned
businesses; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners rightly enacted the Cook County
Minority Business Enterprise/Women' s Business Enterprise Ordinance to address the
problem of low minority and women-owned business participation; and

1390

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 19, 2005

WHEREAS, abuse in the County's minority and women-owned business assistance
programs harms those minority and women-owned businesses which abide by the rules and
should be the legitimate beneficiaries of the Cook County Minority Business
Enterprise/Women's Business Enterprise Ordinance; and
WHEREAS, recently a sub-contract with a county certified minority business was found by
a federal magistrate to serve no "commercially useful" function and has exposed the County
to lawsuits; and
WHEREAS, other local government bodies, such as Maricopa County, Arizona, have
determined that it is better to outsource their MBE/WBE certification programs because
outsourcing is more cost effective, non-politicized, and objective.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that an outside, independent, audit of all prime
contractors who have subcontractors participating in the MBE/WBE program eoAtraets be
conducted to determine the legitimacy of their current MBE/WBE status, and the degree to
which the prime contractors are adhering to their subcontractor obligations in accordance
with the rules of the MBE/WBE program; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the County should immediately begin the process of
outsourcing the certification of MBE/WBE contractors through a competitive bid process and
that the sole function of the Cook County Office of Contract Compliance should be to
monitor certified MBE/WBE's compliance with the MBE/WBE program including
perfonning periodic site visits to MBE/WBE business locations, verifying prime contractor
contractual obligations to subcontractors, and expanding the vendor outreach program.
*Referred to the Committee on Contract Compliance on 04/06/ 05.
Commissioner Quigley recommended that all of the existing purchasing ordinances and amendments be
compiled into one purchasing ordinance; he noted that the Ethics Ordinance includes all relevant
ordinances and amendments.
Commissioner Suffredin clarified that all County ordinances are currently being codified and that Chapter
10 of this codification will compile contract compliance ordinances and amendments.
Colette Holt, Attorney at Law and MBE/WBE Consultant, provided the following status report regarding
the development of the proposed MBE/WBE Ordinance:
As a preface, Ms. Holt stated that Cook County's affirmative-action program had been deemed
unconstitutional by the federal government. However, the outcome of recent relevant court cases
indicates that the legal climate might be conducive to creating a new, County interim affinnative action
ordinance that would pass "strict constitutional scrutiny."
Ms. Holt next explained the various steps that are being undertaken to create a new ordinance regarding
only the construction portion: The Purchasing Agent submitted a mailing list and a list of quotations
submitted for all Fiscal Year 2004 open-market quotations. Data is also being collected regarding the
effectiveness of MBE/WBE ordinances nationwide; this data supports the creation of such a County
ordinance. National data specifically reveals that when discrimination ordinances are struck down
minority bid participation plummets. Relevant court decisions in other jurisdictions are being reviewed.
Also being reviewed is the effectiveness of the County's race- and gender- neutral procedures currently
being utilized in construction purchasing, as well as the County' s contracting policies and procedures.

1391

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 19, 2005

After this research and analysis has been completed, Ms. Holt will draft a proposed interim ordinance to
be reviewed by County officials and their attorneys. Recommendations by these parties will then be
reviewed and incorporated into the proposed interim ordinance. A more complete analysis would have to
be perfonned in order to put forward a legally sustainable, permanent ordinance. Ms. Holt hopes to
tender a proposed interim ordinance to the Board by the start of summer.
Commissioner Quigley asked whether the current Ordinance is being revised and reinstituted.
Ms. Holt replied in the negative. She stated that, rather, the new proposed interim ordinance is based on
new evidence which supports the position that MBE/WBE programs are effective and are also consistent
with the federal constitution.
Commissioner Quigley inquired when Ms. Holt began her duties as the MBE/WBE Consultant.
Ms. Holt replied that she has been conducting research and analysis regarding the proposed interim
ordinance for approximately four to six weeks.
In response to Commissioner Claypool's inquiry, Ms. Holt provided an overview of the City of Chicago's
Task Force which is investigating this issue.
Commissioner Claypool asked whether Ms. Holt has a formal contract with Cook County regarding her
work on the proposed interim ordinance.
Ms. Holt replied that she was tendered a letter that she considered it in essence to be a contract.
Commissioner Claypool voiced his frustration at the amount of time it took to bring Ms. Holt on board as
a MBE/WBE consultant.
Commissioner Suffredin asked whether the Diversity Action Committee has been involved in research
and analysis for the proposed interim ordinance.
Ms. Holt replied in the affirmative.
Commissioner Maldonado inquired when Ms. Holt expects to be finished drafting the proposed interim
ordinance.
Ms. Holt replied that she expects to be finished with the draft by the end of June.
Commissioner Maldonado asked whether the proposed interim ordinance will only address the
construction industry.
Ms. Holt replied in the affinnative, noting that this was the only part of the existing ordinance that had
been enjoined.
Commissioner Maldonado inquired whether Ms. Holt will be involved in monitoring the program.
Ms. Holt replied in the negative.
Commissioner Moreno provided the following outline regarding the reasonable timeline followed to
expedite the drafting of the proposed interim ordinance and to bring Ms. Holt on board in a timely
manner: Commissioner Claypool put forth the proposal in October 14, 2004. The contract was
authorized by the president in December of 2004. The contract proceeded through the normal channels;
as a professional services contract no Board approval was required. The contract was executed in
February 2005, approximately one month before Ms. Holt began her work with the proposed interim
ordinance.

1392

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDfNGS FOR APRIL 19, 2005

Commissioner Gonnan asked whether the proposed interim ordinance will stipulate that a fixed
percentage of contracts must be awarded to minority-owned businesses.
Ms. Holt replied in the negative. She explained that this would not pass "strict constitutional scrutiny."
Commissioner Moreno requested that Ms. Holt provide a report on the constitutional requirements for the
proposed interim proposal.
Ms. Holt agreed to provide this report to the Board.
Betty Hancock Perry, Contract Compliance Administrator, Office of Contract Compliance, provided an
explanation of the certification and recertification processes which the Office of Contract Compliance
conducts on behalf of minority-owned businesses and women-owned businesses. She detailed the
processes as follows:
Applications for certification and recertification are assigned to a certification officer who reviews the file
to determine whether all necessary documents are submitted. A checklist is utilized to detennine an
applicant's eligibility for the MBE/WBE program. If the application is incomplete, or required
documents are not submitted, a letter is written to the applicant requesting submission of the missing
pieces of the application within ten calendar days. If there has been no submittal by the tenth day, a
second notice is sent notifying the applicant that their submittal is past due. If the applicant does not
respond, the application becomes inactive. If clarification of the application is needed, a letter is sent to
the applicant requesting clarification. If clarification is not received, the officer proceeds to wri te a predenial letter explaining why, based on the eligibility requirements, the applicant's firm is not certifiable.
This pre-denial letter is then presented to the denial committee, which is comprised of certification
officers. This denial committee reviews the file to either approve or disapprove the pre-denial letter. If a
majority of the members of the denial committee are in agreement with the pre-denial letter, they approve
it, and this letter is sent to the applicant. The applicant' s firm then has fifteen days to respond in writing
and to submit any documents which might cause a reversal of the denial committee's decision. If the
applicant does not respond within the allotted time, or the documents submitted are not satisfactory, then
a final denial letter is sent to the applicant. The finn is then placed on the denial certification list; the
consequences of being on this list are that the firm can neither bid nor subcontract as a MBE/WBE
enterprise on Cook County contracts, regardless of their certification with the City of Chicago or any
other acceptable certifying agencies. If all documents are reviewed and found to be satisfactory, a site
visit is performed by a compliance officer. An on-site investigation report is completed at the firm, and
pictures are taken of the facility. A thorough final review is completed and a letter of certification is
issued to the applicant.
Regarding recertification, the applicant's submitted documents are reviewed for new infonnation and
changes. If the reviewer concludes that the applicant's finn is not eligible for recertification, the
applicant' s firm is notified of this in writing, the applicant is decertified and is placed on the denial list. If
the applicant indicates that no infonnation has changed, the officer reviews the file utilizing the items on
the check list. If the applicant has not submitted all necessary documents or if the application is
incomplete, a letter is sent to the applicant's firm indicating these findings. If there is no response within
the allotted time, the firm is inactivated. When an application is received that includes all necessary
information and documents, the applicant is issued a letter of recertification indicating their area of
specialty.
Commissioner Quigley asked whether businesses that are certified as MBE/WBE by other governmental
agencies are automatically granted certification by the County.

1393

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 19, 2005

Ms. Hancock Perry replied in the affimrntive, for being included on a bid. However, the Office of
Contract Compliance will then require the vendor to certify with Cook County.
Commissioner Quigley inquired what action the County takes if a business certification is revoked by
another governmental agency.
Ms. Hancock Perry replied that an investigation is begun. Additionally she stated that if an outside source
claims that a business is out of compliance, an investigation is also begun.
Commissioner Quigley inquired what measures are undertaken to ensure that an MBE/WBE business is
not a front for a white-owned business.
Ms. Hancock Perry replied that site checks are perfonned and payrolls are reviewed to verify personnel.
Commissioner Quigley asked whether the Contract Compliance Department reports to the Board that the
MBE/WBE status of a business has been revoked or if this is only addressed internally within the
Contract Compliance Department.
Ms. Hancock Perry replied that this is only addressed within the Contract Compliance Department.
Commissioner Quigley inquired whether Ms. Hancock Perry would consider outsourcing any of the
contract compliance work so as to avoid any conflict with the Ethics Ordinance.
Ms. Hancock Perry replied in the negative.
Commissioner Maldonado inquired what sanctions are levied upon a business when the Contract
Compliance Department determines that this business has fraudulently claimed MBE/WBE status.
Ms. Hancock Perry replied that the case is referred to the State's Attorney ' s Office, and if the fraud is
confirmed, the culpable business is barred from doing further business with the County. She further
added that payment would possibly be withheld from the fraudulent prime contractor.
Commissioner Maldonado inquired whether the existing Ordinance allows brokers to participate in the
affirmative action program.
Ms. Hancock Perry replied in the affirmative.
In response to Comm issioner Maldonado' s inquiry, Ms. Hancock Perry and Gladys Bedenfield, Team
Leader, Certification, Office of Contract Compliance, provided statistics regarding the following: the
number of contracting and subcontracting businesses participating in the affinnative action program; the
number of decertified businesses; and the specific allocation of Contract Compliance Department staff to
various duties.
Commissioner Maldonado voiced his concern that the Contract Compliance Department staff is not large
enough to adequately monitor contract compliance.
Commissioner Maldonado inquired whether Ms. Hancock Perry would support an audit of prime
contractors and MBE/WBE subcontractors.
Ms. Hancock Perry replied in the negative.
