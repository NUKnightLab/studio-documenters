Mr. Brown elaborated on the progress of the screening committee. He stated that approximately twenty
to twenty-five résumés have been received; 80% of them were from out-of-state applicants. The
committee was asked to narrow down the applicants for Mr. Small’s review, which would be followed by
the presentation and review by the Audit Committee. Mr. Brown expected that the screening committee’s
task would be completed within the next week.

UIC Compliance Program Presentation
Chairman Muñoz introduced Jonathan Bode and Dr. William Chamberlain from the University of
Illinois’ Compliance team. They provided a PowerPoint presentation (Attachment #1) on their
compliance program, and answered questions from the Committee with regard to standards and
procedures, training and education.
During the discussion, questions were raised on the System’s past efforts with regard to corporate
compliance. Mr. Small stated that in the past, there was a corporate compliance officer; as a result of
budget issues, that position and these efforts are now largely dormant.
Director Greenspan, seconded by Chairman Muñoz, moved to create an ad hoc committee,
composed of Corporate Compliance experts from the Chicago area, to coordinate with efforts to
bring in the Corporate Compliance Officer and assist in the structuring and implementation of the
program. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
________________________________
Review, discuss and approve selection of an external independent auditing firm

Chairman Muñoz, seconded by Director Greenspan, moved to recommend that the Board retain
Deloitte & Touche as the external independent auditing firm. THE MOTION CARRIED
UNANIMOUS LY.
________________________________
Review and discuss the Request for Proposals
for outsourcing internal audit functions
Mr. Small provided an update on the development of the Request for Proposals (RFP) for outsourcing
internal audit functions. He stated that Pitt Calkin, Interim Chief Financial Officer of the Cook County
Health and Hospitals System, has been working on the draft RFP; the draft is finished and has been sent
to the State’s Attorney’s Office for their review. After the State’s Attorney’s review, the finalized draft
will be sent to the members of the Audit Committee for their review and input. There is a very rapid turnaround time for the process; once the RFP is issued, he expects that recommendations will be made to the
Board with regard to the selection of those responding to the RFP before the next Audit Committee
meeting.
