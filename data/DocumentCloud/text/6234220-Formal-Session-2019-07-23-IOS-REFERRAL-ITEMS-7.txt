Class
Code Classification Salary Range
22-20-55 Senior Data Quality Management Specialist $49,000 $68,600
Request:

The above recommendation is at the request of Angelique Rodriguez-Edge from the Health Department.

Rationale:
The above request and recommendation is based on the ability to attract and retain essential personnel to
staff the Ryan White Program of the Health Department.

The SEMHA (Southeast Michigan Health Association) federal contract ended June 30, 2019. It has been
determined that it is in the City?s best interest that the Ryan White Program be moved in-house.
This transition is necessary to ensure that the program is more cost effective, operates more efficiently, and
adheres to regulatory guidelines.

To determine the appropriate salary range for the classi?cation, a market study was conducted using data from
external survey sources. The proposed salary is essential for recruitment and retention purposes and is based
on the City of Detroit?s ability to fund the increase. The proposed salary recommendation is subject to City
Council approval.

FROM: David P. Massaron, Chief Financial Officer -.- ml - 1--.
SUBJECT: Fiscal Impact of Proposed Contract between the City of Detroit and the Detroit
Department of Transportation Foremen? 5 Association of America Local 337 (Non? Supervisory
Unit)
DATE: July 19, 2019

 

1. AUTHORITY

1.1. State of Michigan Public Act 279 of 1909, Section as amended by Public Act 182
of 2014, states the chief financial officer shall submit in writing to the mayor and the
governing body of the City his or her opinion on the effect that policy or budgetary
decisions made by the mayor or the governing body of the City will have on the City?s
annual budget and its four-year financial plan.

1.2. CFO Directive No. 2018-101-029 Fiscal Impact Statements states that the CFO shall issue
Fiscal Impact Statements for all items requiring fiscal impact statements, as defined in
that Directive, to provide financial information to the Mayor and the City Council as they
consider action on proposed local policy or budgetary decision items.

2. PURPOSE

2.1. To provide financial information to the Mayor and the Detroit City Council as they
consider action on the proposed contract between the City of Detroit (the "City?) and
the Detroit Department of Transportation Foremen?s Association of America Local 337
(Non-Supervisory Unit) (the 

3. OBJECTIVE

3.1. This Memorandum serves as the report on the fiscal impact of the proposed contract in
relation to the City?s annual budget for FY 2020 and four-year financial plan for FY 2020
FY 2023 (the "City budget?).

4. SCOPE

4.1. This Memorandum is not intended to convey any statements nor opinions on the
advisability of entering into the provisions in the proposed DDOT FAA contract, including
but not limited to Work Rules, except for those components of the proposed contract
that have or may have a fiscal impact on the City budget.

4.2. This fiscal impact analysis is based on the proposed contract scheduled to be submitted
to the City Council on July 22, 2019. Should the proposal change prior to final approval,
an updated CFO Memorandum on its fiscal impact would need to be issued.

5. STATEMENT

5.1. Conclusion: The proposed contract has no net negative impact on the City budget.



CFO Memorandum No. 2019-101-014 Page 2 of 2

5.2.

5.3.

Background: The proposed contract?s financial provisions would impact the budget for
the Transportation Department, providing annual wage increases of 2% for all bargaining
unit members from FY 2020 through FY 2023. Additionally, all members will receive a
one-time 15% market rate adjustment in FY 2020. The contract also provides a $200
annual steel toe shoe allowance for all unit members. To help cover the costs of the
market rate adjustment, the contract will reduce overtime rates from the current double
hourly rate to time and one-half.

Fiscal Impact: The proposed 2% annual wage increase is factored in the City budget;
however, the 15% market rate adjustment and shoe allowance are not budgeted. The
incremental costs of the contract can be offset with a combination of the reduced
overtime hourly rate, as well as historic underspending in Transportation?s Software
Maintenance expenditure object. Thus, there is no net negative impact on the City
budget
