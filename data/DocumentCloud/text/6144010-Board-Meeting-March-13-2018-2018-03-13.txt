Working at Edwards was one of the best
work experiences I’ve had on a construction
job. I didn’t have to get up so early to get
to work because since I was working in the
neighborhood, there was no traffic. Even though
I was only a few minutes away, the neighbors
would save me parking spots, give me water and
sometimes food. If someone on the construction
team needed to move their car, they would let
me know.

I have been a Laborer for 16 years and I got
lucky this year being able to work only five
minutes from home.

I’m happy that I was a part of
the team that helped to build
the school’s new lunchroom.
I have friends whose kids
attend the school, and they
really needed the new space.”

Laborer for 16 years

I have twins in first grade and they both go to this
school. I never thought that I would be working on
a school that my kids go to. I have been able to tell
all my coworkers about the little stores in the area
where they can get supplies or lunch,
and the shop owners have welcomed
the extra business. My kids are loving
all the improvements that we have
done to the school; as a matter of fact,
they use the turf field almost every
day. It feels good to work on a
project that is benefitting the
neighborhood that I live in.”
