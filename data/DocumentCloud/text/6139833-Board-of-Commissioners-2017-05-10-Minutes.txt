PROPOSED NO CASH BID REQUEST
Requestor: Matthew T. DiCianni, Village Attorney, Village of South Chicago Heights
Request: Approval of No Cash Bid Request
Location: Village of South Chicago Heights
Volume and Property Index Number:
021; 32-33-102-019-0000.
Summary: Please find included in these materials the Village of South Chicago Heights’s no-cash
bid application. The Village submits this application in order to acquire property commonly known
as 3244 Butler St., South Chicago Heights, IL 60411. There is only one PIN included in this
request. This property was previously used for industrial purposes as the site of the Chicago Heights
Pattern & Model Works, Inc., which employed up to twenty people. Unfortunately, this business no
longer occupies the building, and it has been vacant and unoccupied since 2010.
The Village has retained legal counsel to obtain the tax deed and will bear all legal and other
costs associated with the acquisition of this parcel. If the Village is able to acquire this property,
it plans to rehab the property and market it to an investor in the hopes of bringing jobs and
money into the community. However, there is no investor or third party to whom the Village presently
plans to deed the property, and there has been no third-party request made to the Village to acquire
the property. If the Village is unable to sell the property, then it will use it as the home of its Public
Works Department.
If the Village successfully acquires this property, it will file for tax-exempt status because it
will retain the PIN for municipal use. It will also submit to the Cook County Planning and
Development Department no-cash bid reports on the status of the parcel for five years or until
development is complete, whichever occurs last.
_________________________________
A motion was made by Commissioner Sims, seconded by Commissioner Goslin, that the Proposed No
Cash Bid Request be referred to the Finance Tax Delinquency Subcommittee. The motion carried.

Sec. 34-292. - Race- and gender-neutral measures to ensure equal opportunities for all contractors and

The County shall develop and use measures to facilitate the participation of all firms in County
construction contracting activities. These measures shall include, but are not limited to:
***
(b) Segmenting, structuring or issuing contracts to facilitate the participation of MBEs, WBEsPCEs and

***
Sec. 34-293. - Certification criteria and process.
(a) Only Businesses that meet the criteria for certification as an MBE or WBEPCE may participate in the
Program. The applicant has the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence.
***
Sec. 34-294. - Annual aspirational goals.
The annual aspirational goals for the utilization of MBEs and WBEs on County Public Works contracts
and subcontracts shall be 24 percent for MBEs and ten percent for WBEs. Notwithstanding the above,
Established Businesses may participate in the Program as authorized under Section 34-300.1.
Sec. 34-295. - Project specific goals.
The CCD, following the compilation and stringent review of the most current data that is feasibly and
practicably available relative to the availability of MBEs and WBEs who have the capacity to successfully
supply the relevant goods and services, and in consultation with the User Agency, shall establish Project
Specific Goals for construction, which shall be incorporated into each bid and RFP. Notwithstanding the

(b) The entire amount of fees or commissions charged by an MBE or WBEPCE for providing a bona fide
service, such as professional, technical, consultant or managerial services, or for providing bonds or insurance

not excessive as compared with fees customarily charged for similar services, unless otherwise provided
pursuant to Section 34-300.1.

 Board of Commissioners

Journal of Proceedings

May 10, 2017

(c) When an MBE or WBEPCE performs as a participant in a Joint Venture, only the portion of the total
dollar value of the contract equal to the distinct, clearly defined portion of the work of the Joint Venture's
contract that is performed by the MBE or WBEPCE with its own forces and for which it is separately at risk,
shall be counted, unless otherwise provided pursuant to Section 34-300.1.
(d) Only expenditures to an MBE or WBEPCE that is performing a Commercially Useful Function shall
be counted. To determine whether an MBE or WBEPCE is performing a Commercially Useful Function, the
County will evaluate the amount of work subcontracted, industry practices, whether the amount the MBE or
WBEPCE is to be paid under the contract is commensurate with the work it is actually performing and other
relevant factors. To perform a Commercially Useful Function, the MBE or WBEPCE must be responsible,
with respect to materials and supplies used on the contract, for negotiating price, determining quality and
quantity, ordering the material, installing (where applicable) and paying for the material itself. An MBE or
WBEPCE does not perform a Commercially Useful Function if its role is limited to that of an extra participant
in the contract through which funds are passed in order to obtain the appearance of MBE or WBEPCE
participation. If an MBE or WBEPCE subcontracts a greater portion of the work of a contract than would be
expected based on normal industry practice, it is presumed not to perform a Commercially Useful Function.
When an MBE or WBEPCE is presumed not to be performing a Commercially Useful Function, the Certified
Firm may present evidence to rebut this presumption.
(e) One hundred percent of the fees or transportation charges for the delivery of materials or supplies
required on a job site shall be counted only if the payment of such fees is a customary industry practice and
are commensurate with fees customarily charged for similar services, unless otherwise provided pursuant to
Section 34-300.1.
(f) One hundred percent of the cost of the supplies, equipment or goods obtained from a PCE
Manufacturer shall be counted, unless otherwise provided pursuant to Section 34-300.1.
(g) Sixty percent of the cost of the supplies, equipment or goods obtained from a PCE Distributor or
Regular Dealer shall be counted, unless otherwise provided pursuant to Section 34-300.1.
(h) If a PCE ceases to be certified for any other reason than graduation from the M/WBE Construction
Program during its performance on a contract, the dollar value of work performed under a contract with that
firm after it has ceased to be certified shall not be counted for the remaining term of the Contract.
(i) In determining achievement of Project Specific Goals, the participation of an MBE or WBEPCE shall
not be counted until that amount has been paid to the MBE or WBEPCE.
Sec. 34-297. - Contract pre-award compliance procedures.
(a) For all solicitations, the bidder/proposer shall submit a Utilization Plan detailing all subcontractors
from which the Contractor solicited bids or quotations, and if Project Specific Goals have been established,
its achievement of the Goals or its Good Faith Efforts to do so. The Utilization Plan shall be due at the time
the bid/proposal is due. In the event a bid or proposal leads to a Contract with the County, the Utilization Plan
as approved by the CCD shall be incorporated as a material commitment on the part of the Contractor to each
relevant PCE, and the contractor and the County. Failure to include a Utilization Plan shall render the bid or
proposal not Responsive.
(b) Any agreement between a Contractor and an MBE or WBEPCE in which the Contractor requires that

 Board of Commissioners

Journal of Proceedings

May 10, 2017

the MBE or WBEPCE not provide subcontracting quotations to other Contractors is prohibited.
(c) Where the Contractor cannot achieve the Project Specific Goal(s), the CCD will determine whether
the Contractor has made Good Faith Efforts to meet the Goal(s). Parties submitting bids or proposals for
Procurements may in all instances request a partial or full waiver of one or more established Project Specific
Goal for PCE participation. In making this determination, the Director will consider, at a minimum, whether
the Contractor has:
(1) Solicited through all reasonable and available means (e.g., attendance at pre-bid meetings,
advertising and written notices) the interest of all MBEs and WBEsPCEs certified in the scopes of
work of the contract. The Contractor shall provide interested MBEs and WBEsPCEs with timely,
adequate information about the plans, specifications, and requirements of the contract to allow MBEs
and WBEsPCEs to respond to the solicitation. The Contractor must follow up initial solicitations
with interested MBEs and WBEsPCEs.
(2) Selected portions of the work to be performed by MBEs and WBEsPCEs in order to increase the
likelihood that the Project Specific Goals will be achieved. This includes, where appropriate,
breaking out contract work items into economically feasible units to facilitate MBE and WBEPCE
participation, even when the Contractor would otherwise prefer to perform these work items with its
own forces. It is the Contractor's responsibility to make a portion of the work available to MBEs and
WBEsPCEs and to select those portions of the work or material needs consistent with the availability
of MBEs and WBEsPCEs to facilitate their participation.
(3) Negotiated in good faith with interested MBEs and WBEsPCEs. Evidence of such negotiation
includes the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of MBEs and WBEsPCEs that were contacted;
a description of the information provided regarding the plans and specifications for the work selected
for subcontracting; and why agreements could not be reached with MBEs and WBEsPCEs. The
Contractor may not reject MBEs and WBEsPCEs as being unqualified without sound reasons based
on a thorough investigation of their capabilities. That there may be some additional costs involved
in finding and using MBEs and WBEsPCEs is not in itself sufficient reason for a Contractor's failure
to meet the Project Specific Goals, as long as such costs are reasonable. The ability or desire of a
Contractor to perform the work of a contract with its own organization does not relieve it of the
responsibility to make Good Faith Efforts on all scopes of work that could be subcontracted.
(4) Made efforts to assist interested MBEs and WBEsPCEs in obtaining bonding, lines of credit, or
insurance as required by the County or the prime Contractor, where appropriate.
(5) Made efforts to assist interested MBEs and WBEsPCEs in obtaining necessary equipment, supplies,
materials, or related assistance or services, where appropriate.
(6) Used the services of the Office of Contract Compliance, available minority/women community
organizations, minority/women contractors' groups, government-sponsored minority/women
business assistance offices and other appropriate organizations to provide assistance in the
recruitment and placement of MBEs and WBEsPCEs.
(7) Maintains or commits to establish and maintain a mentor-protégé agreement with one or more PCEs
that is enforceable and that, in the judgement of the CCD, has performance standards and outcomes
that are clearly established and effective in terms of assisting the PCE in acquiring additional skills,

Journal of Proceedings

experience, and relationships helpful to the long-term success of the PCE consistent with the
provisions of Section 34-271(d).
(d) In determining whether a Contractor has made Good Faith Efforts, the performance of other
Contractors in meeting the Project Specific Goals may be considered. For example, when the apparent
successful Contractor fails to meet the Project Specific Goals but others meet it, it may be reasonably
questioned whether, with additional reasonable efforts, the apparent successful Contractor could have met the
Project Specific Goals. Similarly, if the apparent successful Contractor fails to meet the Project Specific Goals,
but meets or exceeds the average MBE or WBEPCE participation obtained by other Contractors, this may be
evidence that the apparent successful Contractor made Good Faith Efforts.
(e) A signed letter of intent from each listed MBE or WBEPCE, describing the work, materials,
equipment or services to be performed or provided by the MBE or WBEPCE and the agreed upon dollar value
shall be due at the time of bid proposal or within three days after such submission.
(f) The CCD shall timely review the Utilization Plan before award, including the scope of work and the
letters of intent from MBEs and WBEsPCEs. The CCD may request clarification in writing of items listed in
the Utilization Plan, provided such clarification shall not include the opportunity to augment listed
participation or Good Faith Efforts.
(g) If the CCD determines that the Utilization Plan demonstrates that the Project Specific Goals have
been achieved or Good Faith Efforts made, with the concurrence of the User Agency, the CCD and User
Agency shall recommend award to Purchasing Agent.
(h) If the CCD finds that a Contractor did not make sufficient Good Faith Efforts, the CCD shall
communicate this finding to the Purchasing Department and recommend that the bid/proposal be rejected. A
Contractor may protest this determination pursuant to the County's bid protest procedures.
Sec. 34-298. - Contract administration procedures.
(a) Upon award of a contract by the County that includes Project Specific Goals, the Project Specific
Goals become covenants of performance by the Contractors and incorporated in the contract.
(b) The Contractor shall provide a listing of all subcontractors to be used in the performance of the
contract, and detailed subcontractor information to the County with each request for payment submitted to the
County or as otherwise directed by the County. The CCD and the User Agency shall monitor subcontractor
participation during the course of the contract. The County shall have full and timely access to the Contractor's
books and records, including, without limitation, payroll records, tax returns and records and books of account,
to determine the Contractor's compliance with its commitment to MBE and WBE participation and the status
of any MBE or WBEPCE performing any portion of the contract. This provision shall be in addition to, and
not a substitute for, any other provision allowing inspection of the Contractor's records by any officer or
official of the County for any purpose.
(c) The Contractor cannot make changes to the Utilization Plan or substitute MBEs or WBEsPCEs named
in the Utilization Plan without the prior written approval of the CCD, in consultation with the CPO and the
User Agency. Unauthorized changes or substitutions shall be a violation of this subdivision and a breach of
contract, and may constitute grounds for rejection of the bid or proposal or cause termination of the executed
contract for breach, the withholding of payment and/or subject the Contractor to contract penalties or other

Journal of Proceedings

sanctions. Upon such written approval by the CCD, the revised Utilization Plan shall be incorporated into the

(5) Where the Contractor has established the basis for the substitution to the satisfaction of the County,
the Contractor shall make Good Faith Efforts to fulfill the Utilization Plan. The Contractor may seek
the assistance of the Office of Contract Compliance in obtaining a new MBE or WBEPCE. If the
Project Specific Goal(s) cannot be reached and Good Faith Efforts have been made, the Contractor
may substitute with a non-Certified Firm.
(6) If the County requires the substitution of an MBE or WBEPCE subcontractor listed in the Utilization
Plan, the Contractor shall undertake Good Faith Efforts to fulfill the Utilization Plan. The Contractor

must make Good Faith Efforts to ensure that MBEs and WBEsPCEs have a fair opportunity to bid on the new
scope of work.
(e) Changes to the scopes of work shall be documented by the User Agency at the time they arise to establish
the reasons for the change and the effect on achievement of the MBE or WBEPCE goal.
(f) Prior to contract closeout, the CCD shall evaluate the Contractor's fulfillment of the contracted goals,
taking into account all approved substitutions, terminations and changes to the contract's scope of work. If the
County determines that Good Faith Efforts to meet the MBE or WBEPCE commitments were not made, or

PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT
AMENDMENT TO TAX INCENTIVE ORDINANCE
BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners, that Chapter 74 Taxation, Article II Real
Property Taxation, Division 2. - Classification System For Assessment, Sec. 74-71, of the Cook County Code
is hereby amended as follows:
Sec. 74-71
(a) Living wage requirement.

 Board of Commissioners

Journal of Proceedings

May 10, 2017

(1) Unless expressly waived by the County Board, any Employer occupying a property that receives a
property tax incentive for Class 6b industrial property, Class 8 industrial property, or Class 9
multifamily residential property shall pay not less than the Living Wage, as defined in the Cook
County Procurement Code (COOK ,/COUNTY, ILL., CODE, Ch. 34, Art. IV, Div. 1 § 34-121), to each
of its onsite Employees, unless such Employees’ Wages are governed by Federal or State prevailing
wage law. For purposes of this Section, the term “Employee” shall mean an employee who performs
duties or services for an Employer on average at least 30 hours per week in any two week period for
which the Employee is paid; “hours per week” shall mean hours for which an employee is paid or is
entitled to payment by the Employer for a period of time during which no duties are performed by
the Employee due to vacation, holiday, illness, incapacity, jury duty, military duty or approved leave
of absence.
(2) On and after July 1, 2020, the owner of any property that receives a property tax incentive shall notify
all Employers who occupy such property as lessees of the requirements of this Section. Upon
commencement of a lease, on or after July 1, 2020, of a property that receives a property tax
incentive, any new lessee shall be required to submit to the municipality or the Cook County Board,
as the case may be, an affidavit stating that such lessee is paying a Living Wage to its Employees in
compliance with this Section. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the requirements of
this Section shall not apply to an Employer who was a lessee and not an owner-occupant of a property
that receives a property tax incentive prior to July 1, 2020.
(23) This Section shall not apply to Employers that are not-for-profit organizations or funded by Federal
grants or Federal loans or Employers who are lessees but are not owners of a property that receives
a property tax incentive prior to adoption of this amended Ordinance. Further, this Section shall not
apply to Employers who can demonstrate to the County Board that compliance with the requirements
of this Section would cause such Employer to be in violation of the terms of a collective bargaining
agreement between the Employer and a labor union.
(4) Every Employer required to pay the Living Wage shall notify its Employees of the Living Wage
requirement and shall notify all of its Employees annually of any adjustment to the Living Wage. In
addition, the Employer shall notify its Employees that if any Employee contends that the Employer
is not paying a Living Wage or has otherwise violated this section, that Employee may file a
complaint with the Cook County Commission on Human Rights ("Commission").The Commission
shall investigate alleged violations of the Living Wage Ordinance and is authorized to adopt
regulations for the proper administration and enforcement of its provisions. If at the conclusion of
the Commission's investigation, the Commission finds that the Employer has violated this section, it
shall (1) in the case of an Employer receiving a property tax incentive, notify the Assessor; or (2) in
the case of a Contractor or a subcontractor required to pay the Living Wage, notify the CPO, who
shall exercise such remedies as are in the best interest of the County, including ordering the Employer
to pay back pay and penalties, as provided in this section.
(35) If an Employer is found to be in violation of this section, such Employer may be required to pay
back pay to each affected Employee, and may also be fined by the County up to $100.00 for each
affected Employee for each day paid at less than the Living Wage. Such penalties will not be imposed
on any Person except after a hearing (COOK COUNTY, ILL., CODE, Ch. 2, Art. IX). Further, if an
Employer is found to be in violation of this section, the property tax incentive for this property is
subject to revocation.

 Board of Commissioners

Journal of Proceedings

May 10, 2017

(46) If an Employer is found to have retaliated against an affected Employee, the Employer’s property
tax incentive may be terminated unless such Employer appropriately reinstates or compensates
such Employee.
(57) For the purposes of this Section:
Property tax incentive means a reduction in the assessment level as set forth in Division 2 of this
Article for Class 6b industrial property, Class 8 industrial property, or Class 9 multifamily residential
property. "Property tax incentive" shall not include a Class 9 designation granted to supportive living
facilities, which establish an alternative to nursing home care for low income older persons and
persons with disabilities under Medicaid and which are certified by the State Department of Public
Aid pursuant to Division 2 of this Article; and
Sales tax means the Retailer's Occupation Tax, the Service Occupation Tax and/or the Use Tax.
(68) Living Wage Affidavit
Every municipality or the Cook County Board that provides a Resolution or Ordinance or authorized
officer letter, as the case may be, to an applicant for a Class 6b industrial property or a Class 8
industrial property tax incentive shall maintain in its files and records documentation that such
municipality or the County Board received and filed the Living Wage Affidavit submitted by the
owner or lessee of such property stating that such owner or lessee is paying a Living Wage to its
Employees in compliance with this Section. Further, an applicant or lessee of a Class 9 multifamily
residential property tax incentive shall provide the municipality or the Cook County Board, as the
case may be, a Living Wage Affidavit which shall be maintained by such municipality or the Cook
County Board in its files and records.
(b) State or Federal Laws.
(1) Except where a Person has requested an exception from the Assessor and the County Board expressly
finds that granting the exception is in the best interest of the County, such Person including any
Substantial Owner (as defined in COOK COUNTY, ILL., CODE, Ch. 34, Art. V § 34-367) shall be
ineligible to receive any property tax incentive noted in Division 2 of this Article if, during the fiveyear period prior to the date of the application, such Person or Substantial Owner (as defined in COOK
COUNTY, ILL., CODE, Ch. 34, Art. V § 34-367) admitted guilt or liability or has been adjudicated guilty
or liable in any judicial or administrative proceeding of committing a repeated or willful violation of
the Illinois Wage Payment and Collection Act, 820 ILCS 115/1 et seq., the Illinois Minimum Wage
Act, 820 ILCS 105/1 et seq., the Illinois Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, 820

U.S.C. 201, et seq., or any comparable state statute or regulation of any state, which governs the
payment of wages.
(2) The Assessor shall obtain an affidavit or certification from every Person and Substantial Owner (as
defined in COOK COUNTY, ILL., CODE, Ch. 34, Art. V § 34--367) who seeks a property tax incentive
from the County as noted in Division 2 of this Article certifying that the Person or Substantial Owner
(as defined in COOK COUNTY, ILL., CODE, Ch. 34, Art. V § 34-367) has not violated the statutory
provisions identified in Subsection (a) of this Section.

(3) If the County or Assessor becomes aware that a Person or Substantial Owner (as defined in COOK
COUNTY, ILL., CODE, Ch. 34, Art. V § 34--367) has admitted guilt or liability or has been adjudicated
guilty or liable in any judicial or administrative proceeding of committing a repeated or willful

Standards Act of 1938, 29 U.S.C. 201, et seq., or any comparable state statute or regulation of any
state, which governs the payment of wages during the five-year period prior to the date of the
application, but after the County has reclassified the Person's or Substantial Owner's (as defined in
COOK COUNTY, ILL., CODE, Ch. 34, Art. V § 34-367) subject property under a property tax incentive

Summary: Under this proposed increase and six-month extension of the interagency agreement,
the Illinois Housing Development Authority (IHDA) will continue to operate a toll-free helpline
service and manage and administer housing counseling services as a part of the Circuit Court’s
free Mortgage Foreclosure Mediation Program.
Families facing foreclosure call the IHDA’s helpline to receive important information on the
foreclosure process and to set up an appointment with a HUD-certified housing counseling
agency. Families receive the housing counseling services from IHDA’s seven (7) HUD-certified
subcontractors which were selected after a rigorous application process and are located throughout
Cook County. Services include: one-on-one housing counseling with families; assistance with applying
for loan modifications; and identification of other options to avoid foreclosure whenever possible.
Each family receives an average of four (4), one-on-one counseling sessions. As of 12/31/2016,
IHDA’s subcontractors assisted more than 157,000 families through the helpline, provided more
than 88,000 families with free one-on-one initial housing counseling sessions, and conducted
more than 300 housing counseling workshops throughout Cook County at which almost 9,000
families received assistance.
The increase and extension are necessary for the remainder of the program year. Request
for Proposals (RFPs) are in process for all program services.

Summary: In 2013, Cook County leveraged pricing discounts available to volume purchasers by aggregating
its technology needs with the City of Chicago. A joint City-County RFP was issued and representatives from
both government entities recommended that CDW Government LLC be awarded. The contract allows County
elected official IT departments to procure necessary software and equipment through an online ordering
system.
This Board subsequently approved a contract increase in 2015 to facilitate grant-funded purchases by the
Department of Homeland Security, and additional purchases for other offices under the President and
separately elected officials. The Board next approved an increase and first of two (2) renewal options available
in the contract to allow County agencies to continue to procure necessary software and equipment in 2016.
Both contract increases were accompanied by corresponding amendments to reduce the mark-up cost for any
newly added software items.
The Bureau of Technology now requests the second of two (2) renewal option for one-year and increase to
the contract in order to sustain County IT requirements for all elected official IT departments while an ongoing
replacement RFP process is completed.
This contract was awarded through a competitive Request for Proposal (RFP) process in accordance with the
Cook County Procurement Code. CDW Government was awarded based on established evaluation criteria.
