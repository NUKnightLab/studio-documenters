Public Hearings Presentation.February 27, 2019
Motion By: Robert Daddow
Support By: Freman Hendrix
Action: Received and Filed
The motion carried by a unanimous vote.
Chairman Baker asked if there was anyone in the audience that would like to
make comments regarding the Proposed FY 2020 and FY 2021 Biennial Budget,
the Proposed FY 2020 Water and Sewerage Service Charges, or the FY 2020
through FY 2024 Capital Improvement Program.
Cinday Darrah addressed Directors Brown and Hendrix, representatives for the
City of Detroit, regarding a reduction in rates for City of Detroit residents.
Michelle George addressed the Board regarding rate increases for the City of
Detroit residents.
Saulius Simoliunas addressed the Board regarding Great Lakes Water Authority
debt.
JoAnn Warwick addressed the Board regarding concerns relating to
contaminates leaking into the water system by demolition sites, and the
notification process when there is a problem with the water.
Chairman Baker asked if there was anyone else in the audience that would like
to make comments.
There were no further comments by the audience, however, Director Brown
responded to public comments made regarding rate increases and contaminates
leaking into the water system.
Director Brown stated that prior to the Great Lakes Water Authority being
established in January 2016, DWSD saw double digit rate increases for 20 straight
years; one year it was as high as 17%, and our rates are now capped by 4% of
revenue, and DWSD has not increased rates any higher than 4% for the last two
years, and DWSD is being very diligent about keeping rates as low as possible.
Director Brown also responded to the comments made regarding the demolition
issues and contaminated soil and stated that DWSD does not have a well system,
it has enclosed pipes, so there is little to no chance that any dirt that is
contaminated could seep into our system.
There being no further public comments, Chairman Baker adjourned today's
Public Hearings at 2:50 p.m. and advised the public that if the Budget, Charges
