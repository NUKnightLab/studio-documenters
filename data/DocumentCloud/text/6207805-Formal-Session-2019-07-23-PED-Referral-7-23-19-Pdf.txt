HONORABLE CITY COUNCIL

RE: Resolution to extend the review period of the City Planning Commission report and
recommendation relative to Recodification of Chapter 61 of the 1984 Detroit City
Co, Zoning, to Chapter 50 of the 2019 Detroit City Code.

On Your Honorable Body?s formal agenda of April 30, 2019, the report and recommendation of
the City Planning Commission was taken up, reaf?nning the support of the proposed new
Zoning Chapter of the 2019 Recodi?ed Detroit City Code.

The CPC report noted that the 120-day review period speci?ed by See. 61-3-79(d) of the Detroit
Zoning Ordinance would expire on August 28, 2019. The Zoning Ordinance provides that where
a CPC recommendation has not been voted on within 120 days, the matter is deemed to have
been denied. Since unanticipated delays will cause the 2019 Recodi?ed Code, including the
Zoning Chapter (Chapter 50), to be taken up subsequent to the August 28th date, a resolution is
attached to extend the review period.

Adoption of this resolution prior to summer recess will allow the Council to review and act on
the Zoning Chapter after Labor Day as part of the proposed Recodi?cation Ordinance without
need for a refreshed recommendation from the CPC.

Respectfully submitted,

macaw/21%

Subject: City Council Quarterly Report, 4th Quarter FY 2019, Detroit Land Bank Authority

Dear Council President Jones:

lam pleased to submit this quarterly report on behalf of the Detroit Land Bank Authority (DLBA).
The holistic approach to blight elimination continues to improve the quality of life for
Detroit residents and drive neighborhood investment. We continue to think creatively about
practical solutions that will further our mission of returning blighted, vacant properties to
productive use. The DLBA tested new campaigns, reshaped leadership, and increased
transparency during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019.

Highlights from the quarter include:

DETROIT LAND BANK AUTHORITY

INVENTORY DEPARTMENT

ROBERT LINN, DIRECTOR OF INVENTORY

 

The Detroit Land Bank Authority?s (DLBA) Inventory Department oversees the acquisition,
assessment, and pipeline assignments for all parcels in the inventory. The department also
oversees data analysis and interagency coordination with other city agencies and harnesses these
roles to inform a sales strategy for the organization. Housing these two functions together allows
the department to implement a flexible approach informed by on?the-ground sales trends and
rapidly implement strategic efforts.

With a new structure in place and a preliminary market analysis completed in QB, Inventory
Department staff began refining the sales strategy in Q4 2019. Historically, the DLBA
emphasized selling property in the strongest neighborhoods; now, inventory is concentrated
increasingly in areas with low market value and low rates of value change. Houses in areas with
lower home values tend to have fewer interested purchasers, consequently the structure
sales programs faced headwinds in fiscal year 2019.1 To better respond to these changes, the
Inventory Department began three strategic efforts in Q4: Own-lt-Now maintenance, Building
Block events, and a sign pilot.

Pre-Sale Maintenance of Own-lt?Now Listings

Previously, Own-It-Now properties did not receive maintenance, but in the fourth quarter, the
Inventory Management team launched a limited maintenance routine for new Own-It-Now listings
to improve their appearance. Staff started securing homes, completing limited exterior
maintenance and landscaping, and clearing basement debris. To date the DLBA has completed
this work at 418 Own-It-Now properties.

Building Block Events

Building upon the success of the past Dream Model events, in Q4 the Inventory
Department launched a new community-focused campaign: Building Block Events. Working hand?
in-hand with a neighborhood partner organization, staff coordinate advance maintenance, plan a
block pa rty-Iike event, and facilitate home viewings to increase market exposure. The DLBA hosted
11 Dream Models across the city between 2016 and 2019and found the events often sparked new
market interest.

Sale Event Number Sold/Closed Total Featured Percent Sold
Dream of Detroit 4 8 50%
Russell Woods 7 14 50%

PAST DREAM
MODEL EVENTS

Full 6 Iklma curl Emr?

Sales rates of Dream Model listings exceeded those of typical Own-It-Now properties. Additionally,
the sales impact is even more stark, considering the market context at the time ofthe listing. For
example, in North Banglatown, after eight unsuccessful attempts to sell Auction properties in the
neighborhood, 67% of listed properties sold in that area using the Dream Model sales approach.
Similarly, sale rates after Dream Models more than doubled previous auction efforts in North
LaSalle and Russell Woods. Staff anticipates being able to further improve upon these metrics
with Building Blocks? added programming, maintenance, and strategic planning.

Sign Pilot: In the fourth quarter, staff began a pilot program to identify the most efficient and
effective means of marketing for-sale properties on the ground. Currently, the organization has
inconsistently used paper fliers stapled to properties, which may be difficult to read and offer less
durability. In Q1 and Q2 2020, staff will post a variety of different signs on properties as they are
listed and evaluate the sales impact. Staff have begun by posting large posters on properties and
will transition to metal signs and wooden signs later in the quarter.

DATA MANAGEMENT

The Data Management team oversees research and data analysis forthe DLBA. The team conducts
demographic and market analyses, completes statistical analysis, oversees internal data integrity,

4 

 

and develops research reports to guide decision?making and evaluate programs. The team also
oversees the vetting and listing process for Side Lot sales.

Building Block Neighborhood Selection

In support of the Building Block events, the Data Management team conducted extensive spatial
analysis and due diligence selecting host neighborhoods. Staff identified areas with maximum
overlap between concentrations of vacant and salvageable DLBA-owned homes, favorable market
conditions, resident interest, relevant neighborhood amenities, and city neighborhood
investments. Combining datasets from the United States Postal Service, Multiple Listing Service,
and various City agencies, staff identified 36 host neighborhoods across the city.

In Q4 2019, the Data Management team responded to 2,954 Side Lot purchase requests from the
public, compared to an average of 1,661 in each of the first three quarters of the fiscal year. This
increased processing volume eliminated the entire Side Lot purchase inquiries backlog, allowing for
faster inquiry response going forward.

STRATEGIC 

The Strategic Initiatives team identifies and implements new and creative means of returning
properties to productive reuse and managing interagency planning relationships. in Q4 2019, the
team hired two new Project Managers, allowing the team to begin working at full capacity for the
first time. In Q4 2019, the growing team hosted a small-scale, Detroit developers symposium,
began planning for Building Block events, and advanced the parks planning efforts.

Rebuilding the Block: A Small-Scale Housing Developer Symposium

The Detroit Land Bank Authority (DLBA) hosted Rebuilding the Block: A Small-Scale Housing
Developer Symposium April 26th, in coordination with City of Detroit agencies including the
Department of Neighborhoods and the Housing and Revitalization Department. Objectives
included better understanding strategies for rehabilitation as well as the biggest obstacles
currently impeding progress. The symposium brought over 60 experienced developers and
residents together for in?depth conversations about rebuilding Detroit's neighborhoods.
Presentations and panels included 20 experts focused topics related to small-scale housing

Building Blocks Events

The Strategic Initiatives Team worked for several months on the Building Blocks sales strategy. The
goal is to work with neighborhood stakeholder organizations to identify a housing sales strategy
which engages residents and potential homeowners and highlights community assets. On June 29,
2019, DLBA hosted the first Building Blocks Event in Nardin Park, on Detroit?s west side. Dozens of
residents visited the open houses. Based on community input, there was a local band and ice
cream truck to encourage more residents to visit DLBA properties. Two building block events are
scheduled for August 2019, in the East Canfield/West End and Oakman Boulevard communities.
The goal is to host ten more Building Block events across the city by March 31?, 2020.

INVENTORY MANAGEMENT

The Inventory Management Division combines property condition information, zoning, market
data, neighborhood plans, and resident input to determine the best strategy for returning DLBA-
owned structures to productive use. The team evaluates structures for sale or demolition,
identifying home sale opportunities and overseeing the preparation and listing of properties for
sale.

Pipeline Management

The table below shows the current status of the 24,790 structures (a 1,427 structure
decrease from last quarter). Properties in the Auction, Own?It-Now, and Renovation Programs
pipelines include properties currently for sale and those slated forfuture sale. Occupied properties
include those already in the Buy Back program, as well as those being reviewed for Buy Back or
another occupied sales program, and are managed by the Disposition Department. The 'Projects?
status is for any property under review for possible sale outside of the main sales programs,
such as the Community Partners Program or coordinating with the Bridging Neighborhoods
Program. ?Salvage? means the DLBA determined the structure to be salvageable but is not currently
preparing it for sale. If a member of the public indicates interest in purchasing a property in
?Salvage?, then the DLBA will vet the property for a potential sale.

For Sale Signs
In the fourth quarter, Inventory staff launched a pilot program to better understand the most

effective approach to marketing properties on the ground. Currently, the land bank does not
consistently post 'for sale' signs on properties as they are listed. To identify which type of sign is
most effective at attracting potential buyers, and to better understand logistical concerns, the
team initiated a statistical study. At the end of Q4 2019, staff began placing 24" 18" posters on
Own?It?Now properties when listed for sale. Next quarter the DLBA will test metal lawn signs and
traditional wooden realtor-style signs. Then data will determine the most effective and
cost?efficient option for long-term implementation.

Auction

Since the Auction program?s inaugural sales date of May 5,2014 through June 30, 2019, the 
Inventory Department has listed 2,928 unique properties for sale through the Auction platform.

Own-It-Now

The Own-lt?Now (OIN) program is another vehicle for moving vacant DLBA-owned homes toward
sale, rehabilitation, and occupancy. The program?s lean processes and lower sale preparation costs
allowed the Inventory team to make houses available for sale in a fast?paced yet strategic manner
in neighborhoods citywide? including some of the Detroit?s most challenged while remaining
responsive to purchase requests from members of the public.

Once a complement to the Auction program, the Own-lt-Now program has now surpassed the
Auction program in terms of the number of houses listed for sale and sold. Since the program?s
launch in Feb 2016, the Inventory team has listed more than 4,000 houses for sale on the Own-lt?
Now platform, providing an important avenue for home ownership and rehabilitation to residents
in neighborhoods throughout the city. Outside of Hardest Hit Fund (HHF) Zones for example, the
Inventory team has made 698 vacant homes available through the Own-It?Now program.

In Q4 2019, Inventory Management staff responded to 524 home purchase requests by listing 429
homes for sale. The DLBA notifies any interested buyers prior to sale with an automated call. With
a substantial ramp-up in listings this year, the Inventory team has made 1,073 houses Own-lt-Now
available, nearly twice the number of houses made available during the same period last year.
Given the opportunity afforded by resilient market demand, Inventory department staff plan to
further increase the number of houses listed for sale on the Own-It-Now platform in the upcoming
quarter. The goal is to consistently list 90 Own-It-Now houses per week by the end of 01 2020.
During this ramp-up, the Inventory team will balance speed and volume with strategic property
selection building on burgeoning neighborhood real estate markets and working in conjunction
with the City?s efforts and the aforementioned Building Block events all the while
maintaining the focus on constituent service by acting upon purchase requests from members of
the public.

Marketing

In Q4 2019, the Inventory Management team prepared an expansion of the broker
marketing program. Staff anticipates increasing the number of atypical properties sold through
realtors in Q1 2020, including small inventory of commercial and industrial sites, homes

9 

 

with extraordinary rehabilitation needs, as well as vacant residential lots with the potential for
infill development or alternative uses.

Property Maintenance

The DLBA works very closely with the City?s General Services Department (GSD) to respond to
maintenance complaints, additionally the DLBA contracts with private, external partners to
perform maintenance on properties in preparation for sales programs. In Q3 2019, the DLBA
issued an RFQ for property maintenance and landscaping vendors. In addition to existing vendors,
staff onboarded several new vendors in Q4 2019 to accommodate the anticipated growth in sales
preparation maintenance. The team is pleased that the four new vendors include Detroit Grounds
Crew, Motor City Preservation, and the Detroit Center for Employment Opportunities office. The
Center for Employment Opportunities notably employs and provides job training to returning
citizens.

The DLBA continues to coordinate with GSD, to address maintenance concerns for properties not
currently in the sale pipeline. GSD's Board Up Brigade is responding to board up requests on
vacant homes across the city, including DLBA-owned structures. GSD is also cutting grass at all
unfenced vacant lots, and the front lawns of unfenced vacant structures.

During fiscal year 2019, the DLBA recorded 2,704 resident complaints about properties needing
boarding, debris removal, or landscaping, etc., resulting in 857 works orders sent to GSD. Many
of these issues were communicated to GSD via 857 work orders. These complaints and work
orders plus the status of each are summarized below. Notably, these tables only reflect lawn
maintenance inquiries not cut through regular, citywide mows, due to fencing, excessive
debris, etc. GSD continues to work through a backlog of maintenance inquiries submitted before
March 1, 2019.

public open houses as well as private showings. Flexibility promotes a faster pace
during the upcoming selling season.

0 Rehabbed Ready public open houses occur on Wednesdays and Sundays,
for the entire time a home is listed for sale.

15 -

 





Rehabbed Ready private showings can be scheduled through
buildingdetroitorg for any day except for Saturday.

Neighborhood Engagement: 1,566 individuals join the e?mail marketing list to
stay updated on new listings, price reductions, and offer deadlines.

- What?s next?

Building the Internal Team: The team now has 8 team members and is
poised to quickly improve on the program with a more robust staff. The focus
now turns to decreasing the per-home loss on sales and increasing the
number of rehab contractors and tradesmen.

Pipeline: 17 properties currently in the pre?construction phase, 17
properties under construction, and 4 properties under contract (closing in
progress).

Focusing efforts in select neighborhoods and spacing out sales ofturn-key ready homes, the DLBA

The DLBA encourages Community Partners to help improve their neighborhoods by identifying
and endorsing homeowners who have the ability to fix up, maintain, and be good stewards oftheir
block. The Community Partner must provide in writing to the DLBA its process for selecting and
endorsing a bidder. The DLBA expects buyers endorsed by a community group to live in the house
for at least three years.

For each auction of a house in its service area, the Community Partner may endorse one bidder it
deems to be a good neighbor. A Community Partner's endorsement triggers an automatic 20%
bonus on the endorsed party?s bid amount. The final price shall not fall below $1,000.

All winning bidders must comply with the terms of the Auction Purchase Agreement, including
deadlines for closing, rehabilitating, and occupying the property. If endorsed buyers fail to meet
these deadlines, the DLBA may terminate the Endorsement Partnership. The DLBA relies on the
Community Partners to vet potential buyers before endorsement.

BUY BACK

The Buy Back Program was created to provide a path forward for occupants of DLBA-owned
houses. it allows an eligible occupant ofa DLBA?owned opportunity to gain ownership
of the house in which they live. After qualifying for the Buy Back Program and the house is
purchased, the occupant officially enters the program and must display consistent savings until
their next tax bill arrives.

DETROIT LAND BANK AUTHORITY

DEMOLITION DEPARTMENT


TAMMY DANIELS, DIRECTOR OF DEMOLITION

 

The Detroit Land Bank Authority (DLBA), in partnership with the Mayor?s Office, City Council, and
the Detroit Building Authority (DBA), continues to impact all Council Districts through its various
demolition programs. In 2015, the demolition program made great strides towards blight
reduction in highly populated/high?density areas, radial thoroughfares and commercial corridors
throughout the City of Detroit. The DLBA gears its targeted demolitions within the designated
Hardest Hit Fund (HHF) geographic boundaries toward reducing blight and spurring economic
activity in these neighborhoods. The strategic demolition efforts are complemented by
strategic reinvestment and rehabilitation, leading to significant increases in property values across
the City.

HARDEST HIT FUNDS

Beginning in June 2018, Michigan State Housing Development Authority (MSH DA) started issuing
credits to the DLBA through its various HHF rounds. These credits represent a refund ofsettlement
proceeds as well as the return of the Fire Insurance Escrow dollars paid to MSHDA. The
total refund is currently $6,602,690.50 and will be used to demolish additional residential
structures. The refund credits were issued to the DLBA as follows: 
$1,192,413.56; HHF3- $638.25; effectively reopening HHF1 and HHF2 rounds. As of the date of
this report, four (4) rounds of HHF funding are currently open, as the DLBA successfully closed out
HHF3 on December 27, 2018.

The initial funding from the Hardest Hit Fund (HHF1) provided $57,342,668.95 in demolition funds
and was closed in the Third Quarter 2015, with a $700.00 remaining balance, transferred to the
next round. To date, the DLBA had utilized these funds to demolish 3,741 residential structures.
As noted above, HHF1 received an additional $5,409,638.69 in new funding allowing the
demolition of approximately 315 additional residential structures. The DLBA identified properties
within the geographic boundaries of HHF1 to expend these funds. Currently, those designated
properties are contracted for demolition. As ofJune 30, 2019, the DLBA received $58,527,800.77
in disbursements from MSHDA, $4,224,506.87 remains. The remaining funds include the
$1,004,355.29, for which the DLBA is currently seeking reimbursement. The DLBA has until
December 31, 2019, to either expend all the remaining allocated dollars or request a transfer of
any unspent dollars to other rounds.

The second round of Hardest Hit Funds (HHF2) provided $50,000,719.05 in demolition funds. Early
in the Fourth Quarter 2017, the demolition team reduced the grant funds remaining under
this round to $5,410.94, effectively closing out HHF2. As of the date of this report, the DLBA has
demolished and received reimbursement for the demolition of 2,965 residential structures. As
noted above, HHF2 received an additional $1,192,413.56 in funding for the demolition of
approximately 70 additional residential structures. As of June 30, 2019, the DLBA received
$50,637,202.65 in disbursements from MSHDA, with $555,929.96 remaining. The remaining

26 

 

funds include the $359,326.38, for which the DLBA is currently seeking reimbursement. The DLBA
identified properties within the geographic boundaries of HHF2 to expend these funds; these
properties are currently contracted for demolition. The DLBA has until December 31, 2019, to
either expend all the allocated dollars or request a transfer of any unspent dollars to other rounds.
The third round of Hardest Hit Funds (HHF3) provided $21,255,000.00 in demolition funds. As of
December 31, 2018, the DLBA had been reimbursed $21,249,169.99; leaving $6,468.26 and
effectively closing out this round of funding. The DLBA demolished and received reimbursement
for the demolition of 1,465 residential structures across the seven Council Districts.

The fourth round of Hardest Hit Funds (HHF4) provided $41,901,646.00 in demolition funds. As
of June 30, 2019, the DLBA has been reimbursed $39,399,660.28; leaving $2,501,985.72 to be
drawn down by the DLBA. This amount includes the $1,938,723.81, for which the DLBA is currently
seeking reimbursement. To date, 2,225 structures have been demolished and reimbursed by
MSH DA. This fourth round of funding allows for the demolition of approximately 2,400 residential
structures, and HHF4 is expected to be closed out on or before December 31, 2019.

The fifth round of Hardest Hit Funds (HHF5) provides for $88,153,425.00 in demolition funds. As
ofJune 30, 2019, the DLBA has been reimbursed $28,689,026.76; leaving $59,464,398.24 in grant
funds to be drawn down by the DLBA, which is inclusive ofthe $7,764,216.86, for which the DLBA
is currently seeking reimbursement. The DLBA expects to demolish approximately 5,200
residential structures under this final round of funding, and HHF5 is expected to be closed out on
or before December 31, 2020.

PROCUREMENT TRANSITION

In April 2018, committed to stabilizing demolition costs and to provide a greater level of
predictability with the release of HHF program Request for Proposals the DLBA began
issuing between 400?450 properties per month for demolition RFP. Given the increased volume
and timing of RFP releases, the DLBA elected to issue an RFP for Procurement Administrative
Services to transition the HHF procurement process to a third-party company skilled at providing
services on the scale and scope envisioned by the DLBA. The DLBA noted that the DBA, its
demolition project manager, was spending an increasing amount of time, resources, and staff on
procurement related issues, limiting the DBA's ability to focus on field operations. Also driving the
decision to transition the procurement process to a third party was the recognition that an
anticipated spike in demo RFP releases and increased supervision mandated by March 6, 2018,
Department of Health protocols could negatively impact the DBA's ability to manage field
operations effectively. Effective July 1, 2018, with a goal of providing increased stability,
transparency, and to encourage the participation of a diverse group of contractors; the DLBA
transitioned its HHF procurement services from the DBA to Price, Waterhouse, Coopers, Public
Sector, LLP PWC was selected based on their response to the they bring a wealth
of knowledge, experience, and a stellar reputation to the DLBA and the Hardest Hit Fund
Demolition Program. A formal agreement was executed on June 30, 2018, and the transition

27 Iw~

 

process began in earnest. Working in close conjunction with the DBA, PWC is currently contracted
to provide project management, process mapping (which includes streamlining the current
process), review, tabulation and recommendations of approximately 10 RFP groups per month.
PWC will also be responsible for administering-the annual RFQ process.

Since completion of the transition in late July 2018, the DLBA has seen a sharp increase in
efficiency; with the time to review, tabulate, and award RFP's down from six-to?eight weeks to just
two weeks. The DLBA successfully eliminated the large RFP backlog during the second quarter;
and while we expected to be completed with the procurement process by March 31, 2019, due to
performance issues with a demolition contractor the DLBA terminated several contracts the DLBA
has been required to rebid properties. The DLBA completed the HHF procurement process prior
to May 30, 20191. Other process improvements implemented under the partnership with PWC
include, but are not limited to, virtual bid openings, recorded bid openings, improvements to the
change order process, streamlined documentation, and increased programmatic transparency.

AUDIT OF DEMOLITION DEBRIS LEFT ON SITE

In February 2019, the Detroit Building Authority the HHF project manager,
received credible information a DLBA contractor, McDonagh Demolition, left demolition debris
(including foundation walls and slabs) buried at multiple demolition sites, in direct violation oftheir
contractual obligation. This prompted the issuance of an immediate Stop Work Order and internal
investigation requiring McDonagh mobilize to each site and verify a_ l properties were properly
excavated, all debris removed, and backfilled. As of the date of this report, McDonagh continues
to complete the work necessary to close out all properties identified in the Revised Stop Work
Order, under direct BSEED supervision

During the course of the ongoing investigation, the DBA received information that four (4)
additional contractors were suspected of engaging in the same or similar practice. To verify the
allegations, the DLBA, DBA, and the City of Detroit sought assistance from the Michigan
Department of Environmental Quality to determine the best method to confirm
existence of unauthorized inert materials left at a demolition site after a demolition had been
completed. Based upon the recommendation of the MDEQ, MSHDA, the City of Detroit?s Building
Safety Engineering and Environmental Department the DBA, the DLBA retained a third-
party environmental firm Great Lakes GPR to scan randomly selected demolition sites using
ground penetrating radar Sites where the GPR suggested the presence of inert material,
established protocol required the contractor to excavate. GPR results led to excavation at four
sites; in all four cases, no unauthorized inert material was found. As a result of the excavations,
the four contractors were allowed to resume work, and MSHDA is funding all compliant invoice
submissions made by these contractors.

 

As the end of the HHF program draws near, the DLBA will judiciously use all remedies available to it when
dealing with performance issues and its contractors; those remedies include, but are not limited to, enhanced
oversight, termination and re-bidding, and calling the payment and performance bonds.

28 i lgi

 

POLICY 

In February 2018, the DLBA transitioned to an RFQ system, to mitigate the arduous submission
process. The new RFQ process allows demolition contractors to become pre-qualified to
participate in the HHF program by submitting a complete qualification package once a year,
instead of submitting qualification documents with every RFP as previously required. On October
29, 2018, the DLBA released the 2019 calendar year RFQ and has approved or is currently
reviewing submissions from eighteen (18) demolition contractors. Please see the Hardest Hit Fund
Program tab of for a complete list of properties demolished and released
to contractors. The DLBA continues to work diligently with the demolition contractors to ensure
their invoices and supporting documents are correct, complete, and processed in a timely manner.

 

DEMOLITION ADVANCE FUND

On March 31, 2015, through the approval of City Council, the $20 million Demolition Advance
Fund was created. The sole purpose of the DAF was to ensure the DLBA had sufficient
cash flow to make payments to contractors providing services under the HHF program, while the
DLBA awaits reimbursement payments from MSHDA. The DLBA in partnership with the Office of
the CFO has been working to amend the Memorandum of Understanding with the City to ensure
conformity with the City Council?s Resolution that created the DAF. The amended agreement will
be presented to City Council upon completion.

As a result of the efforts, working in conjunction with MSH DA and its City partners, more
than 11,872 blighted structures were demolished with HHF money. The DLBA estimates
demolition of an additional 3,100 structures with the remaining HHF allocation. Removal ofthese
blighted structures from the City?s landscape stabilizes neighborhoods and motivates the real
estate market, both ofwhich are crucial to the City?s resurgence

DETROIT LAND BANK AUTHORITY

LEGAL DEPARTMENT

TIMOTHY DEVINE, GENERAL COUNSEL

 



The Legal Department files and oversees expedited Quiet Title Actions pursuant to authority under Section
9 of the Land Bank Fast Track Act, MCL 124.759. On September 2, 2014 the Chief Judge of the Wayne
County Circuit Court issued a special docket directive creating a special docket allowing the Detroit Land
Bank Authority to file these actions in an efficient manner. The DLBA files quiet title actions on its
properties, enabling the DLBA to sell those properties with clear, insurable title. Clear, insurable title is very
important for anyone buying property?not just from the DLBA, but in general. Clear title provides the
property owner confidence in their ownership and any investment they make. It is also an absolute
requirement for any lending institution considering financing a mortgage. As of June 30, 2019, this last
quarter, the Legal Department obtained five hundred thirty?two (532) quiet title judgments.

NUISANCE ABATEM ENT ABANDONED PROPERTIES

The DLBA established its Nuisance Abatement Program (NAP) in February 2014.The Detroit City Council
delegated non-exclusive authority to commence Nuisance Abatement litigation on February 18, 2014
(Council Action Number 23). Properties meeting the NAP criteria are: vacant and unoccupied, boarded,
open to trespass, appear to be abandoned or neglected.

The DLBA initially identifies NAP property addresses using government data, then locations are verified by
investigators, community groups, or neighbors in targeted geographic areas. The City of Detroit
Department of Neighborhoods defined the NAP Target Areas with input from members of the community.
To determine specific boundaries, the DLBA used data sources to specify areas where NAP actions would
be most effective?areas with relatively low levels of vacancy where a limited number of NAP lawsuits could
make a significant difference on an otherwise stable block.

Service of Process is achieved as to all current owners. The DLBA conducts a search of tax and title records
for each property to determine current interest holders of record, including owners, mortgage companies,
and any other liens. The NAP civil suit names current owners of record and requests abatement of the
'nuisance' created by the property's condition. Owners or interest holders in properties who fail to respond
to the lawsuit may lose their ownership rights to the property at a hearing for default judgment.

During the most recent quarter, as of June 30, 2019, the Legal Department identified, placed notices
(?posters?) on two hundred and four (204) and filed suit against one hundred and forty-six (146) properties
in thirty-eight (38) different neighborhoods throughout the City. These actions resulted in agreements to
address the blight or in judgments awarding ownership of the properties to the DLBA facilitating blight
resolution through the DLBA's various programs.

This quarter, there were one hundred and four (104) agreements with property owners to rehabilitate their
properties. Additionally, the NAP program obtained twenty-eight (28) defaultjudgments, one (1) donation
of abandoned property to the DLBA in lieu of litigation, and seven (7) properties purchased from defendant
property owners in cost-saving settlements.

NAP lawsuits are an important tool in fulfilling the mission of stabilizing neighborhoods by
addressing blighted and abandoned property.

COMPLIANCE

The DLBA's Compliance Team enforces agreements signed by property owners who have either purchased
a property from the DLBA (?Sales Compliance?), or whose property was the subject of a Nuisance
Abatement Program action Compliance?). For both Sales and NAP Compliance, property owners
agree to rehabilitate the property within six (6) months and provide regular updates to the Compliance
Team documenting and verifying progress. If a property owner is not able to achieve compliance within the
initial timeframe, but has shown acceptable ?proof of progress,? the Compliance Team provides 90-day
extensions The Compliance team provides an automatic 90-day extension for properties located in a
historic district or properties purchased in the winter.

The Sales Compliance reporting period begins on the date of closing, when the property owner takes title

to the property and obtains possession. At closing, the property owner simultaneously executes a

Reconveyance Deed the DLBA can record if the property owner fails to rehabilitate the property and meet

the obligations outlined in the purchase agreement. Achieving Sales Compliance involves an objective,

three?part criteria including:

1. obtaining the appropriate inspection from the City of Detroit?s Building Safety Engineering
Environmental Department (BSEED)

2. occupying the property

3. exterior maintained no boards, no blight.

The NAP Compliance program works with property owners who have entered into an agreement to avoid
or stop litigation on properties identified as vacant, blighted, and a nuisance. The agreement outlines their
responsibilities for rehabilitating or demolishing the property or selling it to someone who will. If the
property owner fails to provide ?proof of progress" on the subject property, the Compliance Team transfers
the matter to DLBA attorneys for court action. To achieve NAP Compliance owners must demonstrate the
property is no longer a nuisance to the residents and the neighborhoods evidenced by occupancy and
exterior maintenance no boards, no blight. After achieving NAP Compliance, the DLBA releases its lis
pendens and dismisses the lawsuit.

Compliance Properties On The Dangerous Buildings List

The Compliance team worked diligently in the fourth quarter to manage and process Dangerous Buildings
List deferral applications. In the previous quarter, the DLBA Compliance team sent a mass email to 382
property owners regarding their property?s status on the Dangerous Buildings list; maintained by the
Buildings, Safety, Engineering and Environmental Department (BSEED) and approved by City Council. In
response to feedback from those property owners, the DLBA, in collaboration with BSEED, developed a
free, streamlined, online application process to assist homeowners seeking Dangerous Buildings list
deferrals.

To eliminate this incumbrance for future buyers, the DLBA stopped sale on Auction and Own-lt?Now
properties with a Dangerous Buildings List designation. Throughout the fourth quarter, representatives
from the Community Affairs, Inventory, and Legal departments worked in collaboration with BSEED on a
long-term solution. The result was a resolution, drafted by the City?s Law Department, that, if adopted,
removes all properties associated with the DLBA from the Dangerous Buildings list. This resolution is
expected to come before City Council in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020.

DATA SOLUTIONS

Data collection, organization, and analysis is critical to the functionality and forward growth of the
Detroit Land Bank Authority?s Inventory, Disposition, Demolition, and Legal departments. The
Salesforce system is the most comprehensive property database in the City of Detroit and
the backbone ofthe DLBA. Since launching in 01 2015, its user base, both internally and externally,
has constantly increased. As City agencies discovered its comprehensive nature, the DLBA receives
frequent requests to add users from departments with diverse missions; from the Detroit Police
Department to the Detroit City Council and Department of Neighbors. The DLBA provides access
and support at no cost to City agencies.

In Q4 2019 a record number of external Salesforce partner users were added. There are 531 active
Salesforce users {173 358 60 of which were added this quarter

The Detroit Police Department was a large contributor to this growth. The robust
Salesforce database/operational platform is of great value to the DPD in responding to the



 

concerns of Detroit Citizens, particularly related to property. ?Access to the DLBA instance of
Salesforce helps DPD in two main ways: ownership verification and tracking of actions occurring at
a property.? Neil Tambe, Strategic Project Manager at the Office of the Chief of Police. We always
look forward to increased partnership with City Agencies.

Tracking ownership helps DPD officers determine appropriate actions when an issue arises relating
to a property. For example, if DPD receives a complaint at a property checking the ownership helps
DPD determine whether the next steps should be to contact the owner, pursue action through the
Detroit Land Bank Authority, or pursue action through other means.

Additionally, access assists the DPD understand what actions DLBA or other entities are taking at
a property. For example, the property may be in the pipeline for demolition or DLBA may have the
property as part of its Nuisance Abatement Program or drug house seizure projects.

Overall, having access to the Salesforce database provides a greater depth of
understanding which in turn assists DPD officers make better, more informed, decisions regarding
the appropriate action to take when a complaint is received regarding a property.

Record Count

Residents contact the DLBA to purchase properties and with concerns relating to other city
agencies. Client Services regularly refer constituents to Office of the Assessor, Wayne County
Treasurer and Register of Deeds, Detroit Building Authority, the Improve Detroit App, Zoning and
Permit, etc.

Often, Detroit residents call the DLBA because they care about their community and need to be
heard. Client Services takes the time to listen and strives to provide first call resolutions in a timely
manner. Sometimes simply providing a sympathetic ear and listening is equally important.

A few words from our clients:

?Representatives were very helpful and friendly and made me happy with their service. 
?The front desk, sta?? are always helpful. Thank you for great service.?
just wanted to let you know that you and your colleagues are for everything! Every

concerns by agreeing to the commitments set forth in the attached Exhibit A, which is

Project on the community and to coordinate the implementation of the efforts to
address such impacts, among other topics that the CITY may determine.

charges, losses and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable fees and expenses for
attorneys, expert witnesses and other consultants) that may be imposed upon, incurred by, or
asserted against the CITY or its departments, of?cers, employees, or agents by reason of any
grossly negligent act, error, or omission caused by the DEVELOPER, any failure by the
Developer to perform its obligations under this Provision, or any injury to the person or
property of an employee of the CITY where such injury arises out of the Developer?s
performance under this Provision.

The MID 030 Meeting #4
5/23/2019

Redmond-absent

. NAC Identified impacts
0 How to handle dust and dirt?
I 2 contractors focusing on it. Brownfield plan in place. BSEED focusing on
it. They will present how to deal with it
Adjacent properties worried about pest stir up
I Same response as dust
0 Lighting and how it affects plaza and alley. Security? How are residents
protected?
I Same response as dust
What are the work hours going to be?
I Absolutely no extended stay. City won?t allow it. Hours will ebb and flow
but within 7am-7pm. Can?t afford city ordinance
0 Want sidewalk to remain open hopefully, minus a few days
I Tight urban design (building to lot line). Need construction space and
can?t create second walkway in Woodward line. Parking lane? Troy
says lane is needed for truck staging for construction site during
operations. Maybe on John side instead? ?Most difficult worry to
address"
Traffic changes (adding lanes on John or Woodward?)
Window cleaning for adjacent buildings (Plaza, Ellington, Whole Foods)
I Will start to think about. Negotiations with owners of adjacent properties
0 Valet queue
I Don?t want to block traffic during events. Thinking of shifting lobby of hotel
to east side of building. 65 ft. further east, valet would be internal. Hotel
would still be on Northside, turning off Woodward, entrance would be
same
0 Commercial vendor intake list, market driven but also community suggestions?
How to get businesses in contact w/ developer
I Already being addressed
0 Want dog park (others are overpopulated and there will be more residents).
Market is demanding Dog Park. If there's green space, dogs will be there anyway
I Private dog parks will clean up after your dog. Who would clean up
community Dog Park?
0 Street facing retail design. How will each vendor fit into the space and in with the
city? Best Buy won?t add to the city?

I Don?t want to add more layers of approvals. There?s also new renderings
for design. There will be design elements. A challenging piece.
Unpredictable. Lots of parties need to agree. ?Committee can?t have veto
right"

0 Questions from public

0 Throughway for cars. In the 19005 there were 3: Brady, Terrace, and Martin

Place. Name them the historic names?
I 

How much from local taxes goes to project? Are you considering using taxpayer
money for impact remediation? These could go to other better things (education,
fire houses, transportation, necessary city services). This is a big private for
wealthy people funded by poor people. Specific benefits for residents? Rent is
already going up. The private developer should be funding, not the community.

I Units are being reserved for affordable housing

I Must add 500 jobs or no tax abatement is given to developers. It?s being
monitored

I Taxes would stay the same either way. Developer gets tax benefits.

I Not a profit sharing arrangement. ?Community gets nothing?-NAC

0 These new buildings do not provide space for community meetings. That would
be a great community benefit.
