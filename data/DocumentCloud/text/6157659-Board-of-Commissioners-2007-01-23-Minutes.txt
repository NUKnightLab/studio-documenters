respectfully requesting that William McHenry, Chief of Police be appointed as a member of the Cook

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
DIRECTING THE BUREAU OF HEALTH SERVICES AND THE OFFICE OF THE
STATE’S ATTORNEY TO DEVELOP INTERGOVERNMENTAL AGREEMENTS WITH
NEIGHBORING COUNTIES TO REIMBURSE COOK COUNTY FOR CARE PROVIDED
TO INDIGENT RESIDENTS OF THOSE COUNTIES
WHEREAS, the Cook County Bureau of Health Services provides health care services to men, women
and children of all races, ethnicities, and religions, without consideration of the location of their
residence; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Bureau of Health Services is often the only provider of health care to
these patients, and serves as a medical safety net for those without other options; and
WHEREAS, the latest estimate of uninsured residents of the greater Chicago metropolitan region is
700,000, which includes six northeastern Illinois counties of Cook, Lake, McHenry, Kane, Will and
DuPage, establishing that health care for the poor transcends county lines and is not limited to Cook
County; and
WHEREAS, it is estimated that three to five percent of all clinic visits, or 22,400 to 37,200 visits, not
including pharmacy or hospital care, are from residents who do not reside in the County of Cook; and
WHEREAS, it is estimated that seven thousand (7000) clinic visits and two thousand four hundred
(2400) emergency visits, were attributable to residents of Lake County; seven thousand (7000) clinic
visits were attributable to residents of Kane County; and three thousand (3000) residents of DuPage
County benefited from visits to clinics operated by Cook County; and
WHEREAS, the budget for the Cook County Bureau of Health Services represents almost one billion
dollars, and is funded by a variety of sources including the federal government, the primary funding
source of these services are the taxpayers of Cook County; and
WHEREAS, it is fair and equitable for the people of Cook County to expect that people of the
neighboring counties in the metropolitan Chicago region share the cost of medical care for the indigent
residents of those counties.

478

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JANUARY 23, 2007
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED:
1) that the office of the State’s Attorney and the Bureau of Health Services negotiate with the
neighboring counties to develop agreements to reimburse Cook County for medical services,
preventative, emergency, and rehabilitative services provided to the residents of their jurisdictions;
and
2) that these intergovernmental agreements be submitted to the President and Board of
Commissioners prior to September 1, 2007, for approval prior to the commencement of the next
budget year; and
3) that after December 1, 2007, the Cook County Bureau of Health Services will only accept out of
county residents at county clinics and hospitals, exclusive of emergency room services, that reside in
jurisdictions which have in place intergovernmental agreements with Cook County.

PETER N. SILVESTRI and JOAN PATRICIA MURPHY, County Commissioners
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
RESOLUTION PROPOSING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A COOK COUNTY
METROPOLITAN REGIONAL HEALTHCARE NETWORK
WHEREAS, the Cook County Bureau of Health Services and its hospitals and clinics serve as the anchor
for the safety net serving the metropolitan Chicago region’s ever-increasing number of uninsured or
underinsured citizens, not only in Cook County, but also the neighboring collar counties; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Bureau of Health Services is facing a significant financial crisis, one that
is not only a challenge for Cook County, but also for the entire metropolitan Chicago region and the state
of Illinois; and
WHEREAS, this crisis is being exacerbated by the large and growing population of uninsured living
throughout the region, federal budget cuts that continue to impact the Medicaid program, and escalating
healthcare costs that continue to be as much as three times the overall rate of inflation; and

479

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JANUARY 23, 2007
WHEREAS, approximately 1.7 million people in Illinois, or nearly 16% are uninsured, and almost onethird of the total state population younger than age 65 are uninsured; and
WHEREAS, more than 30% of Illinois’ uninsured live in Chicago and nearly 40% live in suburban Cook
and the collar counties; and
WHEREAS, the uninsured are generally less healthy, less likely to have a family physician, more likely
to postpone receiving necessary health care and seek care at a hospital emergency room, thus further
straining the health care safety net; and
WHEREAS, the problem of the uninsured is a complex problem that impacts all of our society and
requires national and state solutions; and
WHEREAS, it is no longer feasible for Cook County to provide care for the indigent population both
within and outside its borders, without considerable and increased assistance from other governments,
providers, insurers and health care stakeholders; and
WHEREAS, these and other factors will cause Cook County’s health care crisis to worsen, thereby
placing even greater strain on the Cook County Bureau of Health Services and jeopardizing access to care
for those who depend on Cook County for their health care; and
WHEREAS, these circumstances will likewise place an even greater strain on the region’s entire health
care network, which includes private hospitals, clinics and other providers that also care for the uninsured,
poor and indigent; and
WHEREAS, in the coming months there will be an opportunity to address the problem of the uninsured
as a number of proposals to expand health coverage to Illinois’ uninsured, including those recently
recommended by the Illinois Adequate Health Care Task Force and others, will be debated in the Illinois
General Assembly during the Spring 2007 legislative session.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners shall
establish a Cook County Metropolitan Regional Healthcare Network to be comprised of the Cook County
Bureau of Health Services, area hospitals, clinics, healthcare networks and associations, physicians,
businesses, insurers and others from throughout the region; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners shall hereby establish a
Subcommittee of the Health and Hospitals Committee which will be charged with the creation, oversight
and implementation of said Cook County Metropolitan Regional Healthcare Network; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the purpose of the Cook County Metropolitan Regional Healthcare
Network will be to evaluate the impact of the Bureau of Health Services’ operations on the public it
serves and other health care providers; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Metropolitan Regional Healthcare Network will
also make recommendations to the Cook County Board of Commissioners regarding the appropriate
allocation of resources necessary to ensure that Cook County’s poor and indigent populations have access
to timely and appropriate health care services.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
POSTPONEMENT OF BUDGET HEARINGS
WHEREAS, the President of the Cook County Board of Commissioners annually presents an Executive
Budget Recommendation to the Board of Commissioners; and
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners debates and considers the budget, debates and considers
relevant amendments, and passes a budget for Cook County by the end of February of each calendar year;
and
WHEREAS, in accordance with Chapter 2, Article III, Division 2, Section 2-108(a)(1), the Cook County
Board of Commissioners shall hold regular meetings pursuant to an annual calendar adopted by resolution
of the Board; and
WHEREAS, in accordance with Section 2.02 of the Illinois Open Meetings Act, every public body shall
give notice of the schedule of regular meetings; and
WHEREAS, the Finance Committee of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County has scheduled
meetings commencing Friday, January 19, 2007 for the purpose of conducting departmental reviews of
the proposed 2007 budget; and
WHEREAS, the President has presented a budget that does not identify by line item the unspecified
additional $107-million in cuts labeled “Target Adjustments”; and
WHEREAS, the 2007 budget assumes $43-million in improved hospital billing collections from a
contract that has yet to be let in a fiscal year that is already underway; and
WHEREAS, the scheduled public hearings are meaningless as citizens have no way of knowing the
impact of the President’s budget cuts, given that $150-million in proposed cuts or revenue enhancements

Submitting a Proposed Resolution sponsored by
ELIZABETH ANN DOODY GORMAN, County Commissioner
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
A RESOLUTION URGING THE ILLINOIS GENERAL ASSEMBLY TO PASS REASONABLE
LEGISLATION ESTABLISHING A STATEWIDE BAN ON SMOKING IN PUBLIC PLACES
WHEREAS, there is dramatic evidence that tobacco smoke is a harmful and dangerous carcinogen to
human beings and a hazard to public health; and
WHEREAS, many communities in Cook County have passed no smoking ordinances in an effort to
protect their constituents and employees; and
WHEREAS, not all communities have passed such bans on smoking in public places creating an
environment that is detrimentally affecting certain businesses; and
WHEREAS, this detrimental environment is causing Cook County businesses to suffer losses to collar
counties where smoking is permitted; and
WHEREAS, when Cook County businesses fail, local property tax payers are adversely impacted by an
increased share of the cost of government operations; and
WHEREAS, the only way to protect the public health and local businesses is to “level the playing field”
by creating a uniform ban; and
WHEREAS, it is clear that the best solution to this public health hazard is for the Illinois General
Assembly to pass a reasonable, uniform statewide ban on smoking; and
WHEREAS, legislation has been introduced in both the houses of the Illinois General Assembly that
would create such a uniform ban on smoking in public places.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners urges the
Illinois General Assembly to pass a fair and equitable ban on smoking in public places; and

SECRETARY TO THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS
AGREEMENT
Transmitting a Communication, dated January 17, 2007 from
MATTHEW B. DeLEON, Secretary to the Board of Commissioners
requesting authorization to enter into an agreement with Fletcher Chicago, Inc., Chicago, Illinois, for the
video equipment services essential to the cable telecast of regular meetings of the Cook County Board of
Commissioners.
Reason:

In an effort to identify all possible cost savings, it was determined that the cable telecasts of
the Cook County Board meetings could be performed in-house by the Department of Public

contracting with an outside firm. Fletcher Chicago was the provider of rented video
equipment services for the firm previously contracted to produce the cable telecasts. Total
estimated savings on the production of cable telecasts is $127,965.57.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $44,280.00. Contract period: January 23, 2007 through November 30, 2007.
(018-224 Account). Requisition No. 70180015.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JANUARY 23, 2007
Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Committee on Construction of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County met pursuant to notice
on Tuesday, January 16, 2007 at the hour of 11:30 A.M. in the Board Room, Room 569, County Building,
118 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois.
Your Committee has considered the following items and upon adoption of this report, the
recommendations are as follows:
283663

OFFICE OF CAPITAL PLANNING AND POLICY, by Bruce Washington, Director,
transmitting a Communication, dated November 29, 2006:
transmitted herewith for your approval is a request for authorization for the Purchasing Agent
to advertise for bids for the Countywide Fire & Life Safety System Upgrade Project, Package
No. 7 (4th District Campus and the Department of Corrections South Campus Buildings 1 &
4). It is respectfully requested that this Honorable Body approve this request.
Reason: This project provides for the upgrading or replacement of fire detection and alarm
systems at these locations. This work is necessary to replace obsolete equipment and to
remain compliant with current building and life safety codes.
Bond Issue (20000 Account).
Sufficient funds have been appropriated to cover this request.
*Referred to the Committee on Construction on December 19, 2006.

Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by Vice Chairman Butler, moved the approval of
Communication No. 283663. The motion carried.
Commissioner Schneider voted no on the above item.
283664

OFFICE OF CAPITAL PLANNING AND POLICY, by Bruce Washington, Director,
transmitting a Communication, dated November 29, 2006:
transmitted herewith for your approval is Amendment No. 6 to the contract with
CCH DESIGN GROUP, the County’s Executive Architect for the New Cook County
Hospital, in the amount of $281,669.49. It is respectfully requested that this Honorable Body
approve this request.
Reason:

This amendment provides for final payment and closeout of the professional
services contract for the design of Stroger Hospital of Cook County. The post
substantial completion services extended beyond the six months provided for in
the contract. Design professionals were on-site responding to regulatory bodies,
resolving contractor questions, and performing construction observation through
December 2002, the month the hospital opened. The contract could not be closed
out until final disposition of all related claims. This budget was approved by the
Board of Commissioners on June 22, 1994.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $281,669.49. Bond Issue (22000 Account).
Sufficient funds have been appropriated to cover this request.
*Referred to the Committee on Construction on December 19, 2006.
Commissioner Silvestri inquired whether CCH Design Group had the authority to continue to perform the
services at Stroger Hospital of Cook County after the contract had expired.
Bruce Washington, Director, Office of Capital Planning and Policy responded that additional work was to
be performed after the contract had expired, and the Office of Capital Planning and Policy instructed
CCH Design Group to remain on site and address all questions that were presented by the State and
regulatory agencies in meeting the compliance of the structure that was constructed.
After discussion of the item Commissioner Silvestri suggested to the Chairman that the item needs
additional review of the documents by which the administration is trying to pay the contract.
Commissioner Silvestri stated that he is reluctant to pay the $281,669.49 for a contract that expired even
under Mr. Washington’s explanation in December of 2002.
Chairman Murphy asked Commissioner Silvestri to make a motion to defer the item.
Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Sims, moved to defer Communication No.
283664.
Mr. Washington called upon Karen Crawford, Executive Assistant to the Director of Capital Planning and
Policy to add additional insight on the item.
Karen Crawford, Executive Assistant to the Director of Capital Planning and Policy, stated that the
standard contract for services stipulates that the County can request additional services; and in this case
the Office of Capital Planning and Policy requested additional services so that CCH Design Group could
continue performing duties necessary for opening the hospital. Further, Ms. Crawford stated that the
$281,669.49 falls within the amount of contingency that is available on the professional service contract.
Chairman Murphy raised a concern as to why the County is just receiving an invoice in 2007 when the
work was completed in 2002.
Mr. Washington stated that it should be noted that the Office of Capital Planning and Policy suspended
the services due to a number of errors of omission that the County was looking at regarding the
consultant. The Office of Capital Planning and Policy did not want to make any payments until the errors
of omission were reviewed and satisfied by the County.
Commissioner Silvestri asked if the County was satisfied.

580

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JANUARY 23, 2007
Mr. Washington responded in the affirmative. The Office of Capital Planning and Policy brought an item
before the County Board where the County was awarded approximately $17 million dollars; once the
County received those funds, the Office of Capital Planning and Policy moved forward to process the
close-out of the contract.
Commissioner Silvestri inquired whether it would impose a problem by deferring the item until the next
construction committee meeting, so that the committee can receive more information regarding this item.
Mr. Washington asked what type of information the committee is looking for.
Chairman Murphy stated that the committee would like a copy of the contract and the process by which
the Office of Capital Planning and Policy arrived at this point.
In closing, Commissioner Silvestri stated that there is no legal authority for the County to pay the
$281,669.49, due to the fact that there was no contract, no extension of contract and it appears that the
Office of Capital Planning and Policy did not seek permission from the President and the Board of
Commissioners to do this. That is why he is asking for the deferral so that the commissioners can have an
opportunity to look at the contract and speak to the State’s Attorney, and make sure that the County has
legal basis by which to pay the $281,669.49.
Commissioner Moreno recommended authorizing payment subject to the State’s Attorneys approval of
this payment.
The motion to defer Communication No. 283664 was withdrawn.
Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Steele, moved the approval of Communication
No. 283664, subject to receiving an opinion from the State’s Attorney’s Office that such payment is
legally acceptable and advisable. The motion carried.
Commissioner Schneider voted no on the above item.
283665

OFFICE OF CAPITAL PLANNING AND POLICY, by Bruce Washington, Director,
transmitting a Communication, dated November 29, 2006:
transmitted herewith for your approval is Change Order No. 1 to the contract with SIMPSON
CONSTRUCTION COMPANY, INC., contractor for the Kitchen/Cafeteria Renovation
Project at the Criminal Courts Administration Building. It is respectfully requested that this
Honorable Body approve this request.
Reason:

This change order provides for mold remediation in contaminated areas found in
the kitchen and bathroom areas. This is an unforeseen condition that could not be
identified until after demolition had started and wall areas were exposed. This
remediation will include the encapsulation of the affected areas until condition
assessments can be conducted and the contaminated drywall is abated and
removed.

Transmitted herewith for your approval is Amendment No. 2 to the contract with TRICOR
SECURITY GROUP, INC. in the amount of $78,995.00 for temporary security services at
the Hawthorne Warehouse. It is respectfully requested that this Honorable Body approve this
request.
The County is still transitioning into its use of this facility and the long term security needs
are currently being finalized. It is recommended that existing services be extended until a
long term security plan is executed. This amendment will provide for a time extension of
existing services for the period of January 1, 2006 2007 through June 30, 2006 2007.
Reason:

This vendor currently provides twelve (12) hours per day Monday through Friday
and twenty-four (24) hours per day Saturday and Sunday coverage of the interior,
exterior entranceway and parking lot. Extending this service will provide for the
safety of staff inside and outside of the facility, as well as the protection of the

Commissioner Sims inquired as to how many employees are employed at the facility.
Curtis J. Florence, Project Director, Office of Capital Planning and Policy, responded that there are two
employees at the facility, one inside the facility and one outside the facility in a vehicle.
Chairman Murphy inquired if the employees were full time.
Mr. Florence stated that they run three shifts (six hours each) inside the facility, and one employee on the
outside.

WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners has appropriated in excess of $50
million to purchase election equipment from Sequoia Voting Systems for the 2006 elections;
and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Clerk and the Chicago Board of Election Commissioners and
their personnel have repeatedly assured members of this body that the new equipment would
function properly on election day, and that measures had been implemented that would

election; and
WHEREAS, the County Clerk bears the ultimate responsibility for ensuring the integrity of
elections conducted in suburban Cook County and the Chicago Board of Election

ballots and electronic data storage devices did not arrive downtown until after 1 a.m. the day
after the election; and
WHEREAS, there have been many reports of election judges, public employees and publicly
contracted personnel deviating from the prescribed procedures for the securing and
transporting of election materials; and
WHEREAS, there have also been multiple complaints from voters who used touch screen
voting systems which repeatedly malfunctioned and indicated and reported votes for the
candidates different from the ones selected by the voter.

AN ORDINANCE FOR THE CREATION OF AN ELECTION INTEGRITY
COMMISSION (PROPOSED ORDINANCE). Submitting a Proposed Ordinance sponsored
by Elizabeth Ann Doody Gorman, County Commissioner.
The following is a synopsis of the Proposed Ordinance:
PROPOSED ORDINANCE
AN ORDINANCE FOR THE CREATION OF AN
ELECTION INTEGRITY COMMISSION
WHEREAS, approximately 24 million dollars was appropriated for the Cook County Clerk
to obtain two new electronic voting systems to improve the conduct of our elections; and
WHEREAS, two elections have now been held using these new electronic voting systems;
and
WHEREAS, these two elections have been fraught with events that are indicative of mishaps
or more in the conduct of the election in general and particularly with regard to the two new
electronic voting systems; and
WHEREAS, the public notoriety given to these mishaps occurring before, during and after
the General Election held in Cook County on Tuesday, November 7, 2006 has raised grave
concerns among the voters and candidates as to whether these elections were fair and honest;
and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners appropriates funding for the conduct
of these elections and has an obligation to the taxpayers of Cook County to ensure that the
funds appropriated are expended prudently; and
WHEREAS, it is essential that the Cook County Board undertake an inquiry into the
propriety of the expenditure of these appropriations with regard to the question of whether the
General Election of November 7, 2006 resulted in, among other questions, the new electronic
voting systems allowing each voter to vote for the candidate and public policy issues of
his/her choice and whether these systems allowed the votes to be correctly counted in the
precincts and reported to the County Clerk.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JANUARY 23, 2007
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that a hearing of the Committee on Legislation,
Intergovernmental and Veterans Relations will be held at 1:30 p.m. on January 9, 2007 to
review the findings of the Mikva panel concerning recreating the election night “logjam” of
data that was transmitted to the office of the County Clerk; simulating the transmission of
data from the 2,370 precincts to the office of the County Clerk; simulating the wireless
transmission of data from the remote sites in suburban Cook County; analyzing thousands of

* Referred to the Committee on Legislation, Intergovernmental and Veterans Relations
on 12/19/06.
Chairman Suffredin called the meeting to order and noted that no votes would be taken today. He stated
that the purpose of today’s meeting was to primarily deal with Communication No. 283678, which is a
resolution regarding the review of the findings of the Mikva Panel, a technical advisory committee
established by County Clerk David Orr to review portions of the November 7, 2006 general election.
Chairman Suffredin introduced Langdon Neal - Chairman of the Chicago Board of Election
Commissioners, and Lance Gough – Executive Director of the Chicago Board of Election
Commissioners. Chairman Suffredin explained that Mr. Neal and Mr. Gough were attending the
Committee meeting as observers, and that they have comparable equipment and have been working very
closely with Cook County. Chairman Suffredin also introduced Cook County Clerk David Orr and Judge
Abner Mikva, and then invited Clerk Orr to provide an overview of the results of the Mikva Panel’s
investigation.
Clerk Orr began by providing an introduction to the related subject, explaining that like many
governments across the country, Cook County is moving towards a complex era in voting technology. He
stated that in November, he believed that the voters clearly liked the new touch screen machines, and that
the voters successfully interacted with the new voting equipment. He acknowledged that Cook County
experienced a slower count than expected, and he indicated that that is the reason why he appointed this
committee.
Clerk Orr then introduced Judge Abner Mikva. Judge Mikva described the composition of the panel,
which was chaired by himself, and included many technical advisors, including Ms. Tricha Anjali, Ph.D.,
Assistant Professor, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Illinois Institute of Technology;
Mr. Xiaoping Jia, Ph.D, Director, Institute for Software Engineering, DePaul University; Mr. Ian
Robertson, Senior Director of Global IT – Americas, William Wrigley Corporation and member of the
City of Chicago’s Mayor’s Council of Technology Advisors; Mr. Cyrus Walker, Founder and President,
Data Defenders, Inc. and Department Head, Computer Forensics and Information Security, Wilbur
Wright College; and Mr. V.N. Venkatakrishnan (Venkat), Ph.D, Assistant Professor in Computer Science
and Co-Director, Center for Research and Instruction in Technologies for Electronic Security, University
of Illinois – Chicago. The panel was staffed by Kevin McDermott (a consultant for the Cook County
Clerk) and Diamond Consulting (hired by Sequoia Voting Systems, Inc. but who worked in an
independent fashion for the commission). Judge Mikva stated that the mission of the commission was to
conduct highly complex testing to identify what slowed down the results from the precincts to the central
counting location on election night. He also stated that during the investigation, no questions or disputes
were raised about the integrity of the election.

589

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JANUARY 23, 2007
Kevin McDermott went over the report detailing the findings of the review panel (copy of which is
available from the office of the Secretary to the Board, along with accompanying press release dated
January 9, 2007 from the Cook County Clerk) and Clerk Orr stated the changes and recommendations
that will be implemented immediately as a result of the panel’s findings. (The referenced document is on
file in the Office of the County Clerk.)
Commissioner Daley asked Clerk Orr if there would be any costs associated with the implementation of
the recommendations.
Clerk Orr responded that costs related to the County’s implementation would not be significant.
Many Commissioners (including Commissioners Daley, Peraica, Moreno and Schneider) voiced concerns
regarding similar problems affecting the March 2006 Primary Election that appeared to recur in the
November Election.
Vice Chairman Silvestri asked Langdon Neal, Chairman of the Chicago Board of Elections, if the report
findings were relevant to his agency, and whether he agreed with the recommendations with respect to the
City.
Mr. Neal responded affirmatively, and stated that the analysis was very helpful to the Chicago Board of
Elections.
Commissioner Murphy asked Clerk Orr about election judges, and Clerk Orr responded that their office
would like to expand the program using teen judges. Currently, the law provides that high school seniors
can participate as an election judge, however, the Clerk’s office would like to include high school juniors.
Commissioner Maldonado asked Lance Gough, Executive Director of the Chicago Board of Elections,
about the Chicago Board of Election’s decision to download the early voting prior to the closing of the
polls, as opposed to the County’s decision to download poll and early voting tabulations simultaneously.
Mr. Gough responded that they had determined that it would take approximately four hours to download,
so they chose to download prior to 7:00 p.m., and further stated that they did not ask Sequoia Voting
Systems, Inc. for their input into the decision.
Chairman Suffredin stated that further discussions will take place on this subject at a later date. He also
stated that he will be introducing a resolution at the next Board meeting that will create a special
subcommittee on elections that Commissioner Suffredin will chair (Commissioner Silvestri will be the
Vice Chair.) The members of the subcommittee will be Commissioners Suffredin, Silvestri, Sims,
Murphy, Beavers, Gorman and Peraica. It is expected that when this subcommittee is created, the
substantive proposed legislation related to elections will be referred to it.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
RESOLUTION TO INCREASE
THE STATE’S ATTORNEY’S SETTLEMENT AUTHORITY TO $100,000.00
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of Cook County, pursuant to 55 ILCS 5/1-6003,
shall have the duty “to take and order suitable proper measures for the prosecuting and
defending of all suits to be brought by or against” Cook County; and
WHEREAS, the State’s Attorney of Cook County, pursuant to 55 ILCS 5/3-9005(a)(4), shall
have the duty “to defend all actions and proceedings brought against his county, or against
any county or State officer, in his official capacity, within his county; and
WHEREAS, in the course of such representation, the State’s Attorney is frequently advised
of settlement offers which provide the opportunity to terminate such litigation to the mutual
satisfaction of the parties; and
WHEREAS, on June 21, 1982, the Board of Commissioners of Cook County adopted
Resolution 82-R-242 authorizing the State’s Attorney of Cook County to settle all actions in
which the County may be concerned, provided that “such settlement neither commits the
County to an expenditure in excess of $5,000.00 nor waives an amount in excess of $5,000.00
due to the County in an action brought on its behalf”; and
WHEREAS, on May 2, 1995, the Board of Commissioners of Cook County adopted
Resolution 95-R-188 increasing the authority provided to the State’s Attorney of Cook
County to $10,000.00 to resolve all actions in which the County may be concerned; and

Resolution 06-R-423 increasing the authority to $25,000.00; and
WHEREAS, increasing the State’s Attorney’s authority to $100,000.00 enhances the State’s

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook
County hereby increase the authority previously conferred upon the State’s Attorney of Cook
County by Resolution 95-R-188, to an amount which does not exceed $100,000.00. Upon
request, the State’s Attorney shall provide information regarding the basis of such settlements
to any Commissioner.
*Referred to the Litigation Subcommittee on 12/06/06.

592

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JANUARY 23, 2007
Chairman Silvestri stated that the issue before the Litigation Subcommittee was whether to increase the
State’s Attorney’s settlement authority from $25,000 to $100,000. Chairman Silvestri noted that the City
of Chicago grants settlement authority to its attorneys in the amount of $100,000.
Commissioner Collins stated that she believed that discussion of these cases within the Litigation
Subcommittee is necessary. She further stated that she would, however, approve raising the settlement
authority amount to $50,000.
Commissioner Peraica agreed with Commissioner Collins that $50,000 would be appropriate.
Chairman Silvestri inquired as to how the State’s Attorney’s Office would furnish information on cases
with settlement authority of less than $100,000.
Patrick T. Driscoll, Jr., Deputy State’s Attorney, Chief, Civil Actions Bureau, replied that the information
could be provided in a short letter containing one or two paragraphs, or it could be placed in the status
report as a settled matter.
Commissioner Peraica noted that the items would still come before the Finance Committee for approval.
Chairman Silvestri stated that by raising the State’s Attorney’s settlement authority, the Litigation
Subcommittee would be able to concentrate more fully on the more expensive cases and on attorneys’
fees.
Chairman Silvestri inquired as to whether the State’s Attorney’s Office needs to obtain authority to try all
cases.
Mr. Driscoll replied in the affirmative.
Commissioner Suffredin stated that any settlement that goes to the Finance Committee is not final until it
is voted upon; in cases where the Commissioners have questions, the case can be deferred to the
Litigation Subcommittee.
Commissioner Collins stated that now is not the time to make this change.
Chairman Silvestri stated that the Corporation Counsel and the Attorney General have this much
authority.
Mr. Driscoll agreed that the Corporation Counsel has this authority. He further stated that he was unsure,
however, as to the amount of settlement authority possessed by the Attorney General.
Commissioner Collins stated that by raising the State’s Attorney’s settlement authority, the Litigation
Subcommittee members would not be able to monitor as closely the behavior of County employees.
Vice Chairman Quigley voiced his concern that the County does not learn from its mistakes. He further
stated that, in a conversation with Dr. Robert R. Simon, Interim Chief, Bureau of Health Services, Dr.
Simon concurred that there is a lack of accountability in the Bureau of Health Services and that the
County does not learn from its mistakes. Vice Chairman Quigley listed several factors that need to be
studied: lack of training, faulty equipment, and lack of follow-up.

593

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JANUARY 23, 2007
Commissioner Peraica agreed with Vice Chairman Quigley that certain categories of cases repeat, and
that these cases often fall under $100,000. He further stated that the Subcommittee might not catch such
trends if the settlement authority were raised to $100,000.
Chairman Silvestri reiterated that these cases would be listed on the informational part of the agenda.
Commissioners Peraica and Collins stated that they would approve raising the State’s Attorney’s
settlement authority to $50,000.
Commissioner Suffredin, seconded by Vice Chairman Quigley, moved to approve the resolution on
the agenda to increase the State’s Attorney’s settlement authority to $100,000 (Comm. No. 283410).
The motion carried.
Commissioners Collins and Peraica voted no.

ORGANIZATIONS FUNDED WHOLLY OR IN PART BY COOK COUNTY
WHEREAS, Cook County government is charged with presenting a balanced budget each fiscal year, as
mandated by the Illinois Constitution; and
WHEREAS, the budget process and the budget itself should be transparent so as to allow for proper
scrutiny by the public, whose tax dollars help fund it; and

scrutinize and adjust it if necessary, through the amendment process, to help identify and eliminate
wasteful spending, as well as improve efficiencies; and
WHEREAS, Cook County government has an approximately $3 billion budget and allocates portions of
it to fund independent organizations, either directly or through one of its various departments; and
