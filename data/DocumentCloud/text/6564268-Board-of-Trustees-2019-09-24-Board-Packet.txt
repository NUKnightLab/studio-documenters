RE:

Monthly Update

Board Members,
If you look at your calendar, I think you will be as surprised as I was to see that it was one year ago this
month I began the journey with you here at METRO RTA. We have been quite successful in meeting the
challenges we have faced. Together we have accomplished increasing service to our community and we
have begun a committee structure with you that has proven to be quite productive in taking us further into
the future. We held our first board/leadership team retreat which helped us understand what we expected
and needed from each other. We have strengthened the relationships with our community partners and
th
stakeholders, which was so evident as we celebrated our 50 birthday at RKP and heard our state, county,
and city leaders recognize our efforts and reconfirm their commitment to supporting our endeavors to
provide mobility options for our region. We continue to work as a team both internally and externally,
rebuilding the proud family atmosphere that is METRO. We have basked in the accomplishments of our
past and we are putting our best foot forward as we drive into the future together. Our team believes in
each other and they believe in what we can and will do as we work together. Thank you for an amazing
first year. I look forward to continuing to work with you, with the goal of being the best public transportation
and mobility option provider in the nation.
Yours in accessible transportation,

Dawn Distler
Executive Director

CALL TO ORDER

AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION
None
RECOGNITION
Ms. Distler recognized the METRO Softball Team for winning the League Championship. The
team defeated team GOJO, having taken losses to them the rest of the season. Team coach Matt
Mullen was acknowledged for his role in leading the team to victory.
APPROVAL OF MINUTES
Mr. DeJournett asked for a motion to approve the minutes of the June 25, 2019 meeting.
Ms. Greene made a motion for approval, seconded by Mr. Derrig. The minutes were
unanimously approved by the Board.
CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE & SERVICE PERFORMANCE COMMITTEE REPORT
Chair: Mark Derrig
Mr. Derrig reported that in Maintenance there had been a small uptick in road calls, due to the
warmer weather affecting some of the emission controls on some buses. The bargaining position
that was approved in the 2019 budget has been filled. It deals with off-site maintenance (signs,
shelters, bus stops, etc..).
Operations reported that currently they are 12 operators short, due to some of the previous class
failing to meet employment standards. There are 166 operators training on the new Ford Transit
mobility vehicles. A presentation was made by Accessibility Manager Nykia Walker on
Paratransit Services.

6

 FINANCE & AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
Chair: Nicholas Fernandez
Ms. Neeley reported that the Finance Committee did meet. The agenda was short and covered the
financials shown on the Dashboard, and a brief update of the audit. A more extensive update of
the audit would occur after exit interviews occur in a few months. Internal budget meetings have
begun, and budget meetings would start to be included in committee meetings beginning in
September.
PLANNING / MARKETING / RAIL COMMITTEE REPORT
Chair: Donald Christian
Ms. Shea reported that the committee did meet. There has been a slight downturn in ridership
this month, partly due to one less weekday. For the year, ridership is down by about 2%. The
Strategic Plan RFP will be released in the coming weeks. That sets up future grant planning and
strategies moving forward in the form of both missions and goals for METRO, as well as
financial planning. Some grant opportunities are being pursued to help with business partnerships
and more flexible mobility options for some outlying areas of the county. Mobile ticketing is on
the way.
Ms. Becker from Marketing reported that this month’s packet contained a quarterly infographic.
In preparation for METRO’s birthday celebration, pins were made to be given to all METRO
employees and Board Members. The Birthday Party will be held on August 14th, and will include
many vendors, a DJ, a photo booth, a Touch-A-Bus, an ice cream truck, and much more. The
“Night Out Against Crime” is this coming Tuesday, and spans nine different venues. The Mobile
Ticketing launch is this Thursday, and a mailing went out regarding that.
Resolution 2019-08 authorizing the amendment of the NEORide Bylaws to allow out of state
entities to join NEORide was presented for consideration. Mr. Spring made a motion for
approval, seconded by Ms. Greene. All those present voted ‘yes’, and Resolution 2019-08 was
approved by the Board.
THE APD GROUP REPORT
Chair: Louise Gissendaner
Mr. Hunter reported that the APD Group (Asset Protection and Development) met. There was
discussion about the internal fair labor standard audit, updates happening to the Employee
Manual, advertising for the next class of operators, preparations for negotiations beginning,
suggestions for KPI topics, the Wellness Program, one employment departure, one new employee
for the month of June, the OSHA recordable was up slightly, and the DART rate was also up
slightly. Upcoming events are the EEC Days in the Bullpen and at the Transit Center.
Chief Metcalf reported that there were three preventable accidents in June. There were 158,000
miles in between preventable accidents, compared to 109,000 miles at this time last year. The
Safety and Protection board in the Bullpen has been updated, and there has been a suggestion box
installed. Safety posters are being updated. The Ohio Human Trafficking Task Force presented
two one-hour courses for staff and Board members to attend. Chief Metcalf has been invited to be
an evaluator for a TSA and SARTA exercise to get ready for the Hall of Fame game coming up.
GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE REPORT
Mr. Spring reported that the Governance Committee did not meet.

 OFFICERS’ REPORT
President:
Mr. DeJournett indicated that he, Mr. Christian, and Ms. Distler had all attended the APTA
Transit Board Members conference the previous week. Mr. Christian and Mr. DeJournett gave
reports on their trip.
Executive Director:
Ms. Distler talked about METRO being invited to participate in many things in the community.
She praised Ms. Shea’s pilot program, both in obtaining funding, and also in connecting with
local employers by way of Conexus. Ms. Distler noted METRO’s presence on the Business
Retention and Economic Committee for the county, the city, the chamber, and other partners.
METRO is becoming part of the successes of our community, and the community is realizing that
good transit is necessary for their successes. The Strategic Plan is being developed, with Mr.
Hampshire and Ms. Neeley working on getting projects started. Attention is being given to
meeting goals within the year that are being pursued under the Plan. With a bit of humor, it was
also mentioned that Mr. Mullen was working on finding a fall softball league for METRO’s
participation.
OTHER BUSINESS
Mr. DeJournett noted that in a meeting he attended of the Summit County Health Department, a
survey was done (interestingly, right at our Transit Center) which looked at opinions from
residents who actually ride the bus. It revealed that transportation was seen as both an obstacle
and as an asset.
Mr. Spring brought attention to Ms. Shea being accepted into the prestigious Leadership APTA
program, which will further her development as well as benefiting METRO. Ms. Distler pointed
out that applicants to that program are rarely accepted on their first try, and that this was a
remarkable accomplishment for Ms. Shea.
ADJOURNMENT
There being no other business to come before the Board, Mr. Spring made a motion to adjourn,
seconded by Mr. Derrig. The motion to adjourn was unanimously approved, and the meeting
adjourned at 9:35 a.m.
CERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE
Pursuant to Section III, Article 3.2 of the Rules & Regulations of the METRO Regional Transit
Authority, METRO has complied with the Notice and Notification to the public and news media.

candidates will be interviewed and the goal is to make offers to 15 at this time. The Operations
Department is budgeted for 279 operators, however due to attrition, the department will have a total of
263 Operators effective November 1, 2019. Operator training takes approximately five weeks.
Operations Manager, Jamie Saylor and several Dispatchers and Road Supervisors attended a Human
Trafficking Presentation facilitated by Maria Busch from the Ohio Department of Public Safety. The
presentation was held at the Robert K. Pfaff Transit Center on July 10, 2019. This was open to the

The Director of Operations, De Havilland McCall attended an Opportunity and Inclusion Committee
meeting held at the Greater Akron Chamber on August 13, 2019. Ms. McCall is on a sub-committee for
Minority Business Enterprise (MBE). The committee’s task is to guide the areas where the Chamber
should focus its efforts, and identify where assistance in the business community is needed.

 JULY 2019 CUSTOMER CARE & MOBILITY SOLUTIONS MONTHLY REPORT
PARATRANSIT PASSENGERS: Looking at July 2019 year-to-date passenger counts for all of our
paratransit programs, we are only 1.2% behind the total number of passengers transported 12 months
ago, in July 2018. Further, on average, looking at 2019 versus the last five years (year-to-date figures),
we are level, nearly equivalent year-to-date, within 0.2% of passengers transported. We did have a
strong month in July to bring the year-to-date figures back up to level, transporting 23,024 passengers in
22 weekdays and also offering NET and ADA service on 8 weekend days.
TRAINING, MOBILITY, ELIGIBILITY AND COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT: As a Department, all Customer
Care & Mobility Solution members visited Catholic Charities Summit Adult Day Care Facility (formerly
known as CYO). Jim Mazzagatti’s team was extremely gracious and allowed us to visit in several small
groups, in order to keep our Customer Care Center covered. Participants learned firsthand what all CYO
provides for dementia/Alzheimer’s patients and their caregivers. We walked away with a greater
appreciation for our passengers and for the caregivers and nursing staff who work closely with this
population. This was a true learning visit with a community partner.
31 Wheelchair weight and inspections were completed by Mobility in order to get 31 people in mobility
devices riding our service. Eight (8) individuals were travel trained in the month of July. One group
training was also conducted at Goodwill. Three (3) travel training assessments were completed in which
the applicants decided not to continue with training. 151 applications for various METRO paratransit
programs and to ride METRO line service at a reduced rate were processed in July. Schedule Reading
Classes were also held to help new riders learn how to read our line service bus schedules.
Our Customer Care family attended many events in the community, working with our partnering
agencies such as; Laura Dunlap’s Summit County StandDown, AMHA, Farmer’s Markets Events around
the City throughout the month, Full Term, First Birthday meetings and Committee meetings, Advantage
Aging, Bridgestone Senior Players, Direction Home Pilot Program, Mayor Horrigan’s Senior Citizen
Commission, ArtsNow Senior Event, Senior Commission Member Transportation Background Meeting
and Backpack Adventure at the Zoo.

AUGUST 2019 CUSTOMER CARE & MOBILITY SOLUTIONS MONTHLY REPORT
PARATRANSIT PASSENGERS: We transported a total of 23,819 passengers in the month of August on
paratransit. This is an increase each August from 2012 to 2017. August 2018 had a slight increase of
only 1.6% over 2019, with one additional weekday. ADA passengers transported account for 8.1% of all
passengers transported and NET accounted for 14.6%. Our numbers continue to remain steady overall.
DJFS NET AUDIT: Summit County Department of Job and Family Services performed our annual NonEmergency Transportation (NET) audit. No deficiencies were found and they were very pleased with our
complete transparency.

11

 NEW BUSINESS: We worked closely with Planning on the Flex-Ride pilot program grant, in order to help
employees get to work where transportation is a barrier due to location or shift times. With a terrific
team assembled we created a unique concept that we will be putting into place 1st Quarter 2020. This
includes working with our Paratransit software company, Ecolane, to provide their app for this project.
In our role as senior citizen advocates, on behalf of METRO, I was asked to be a part of the Akron
Community Foundation’s On The Table discussions on 10/3/19 to discuss Our Aging Seniors. We are
partnering with our Public Relations team, who was also approached, and expanding the On The Table
discussion to include the priority issue of Diversity, Equity and Social Inclusion, as well.
METRO’s Paratransit team is part of Direction Home’s Coordinated Intake Pilot Program working to
coordinate services for those who have fallen through the cracks. Each partner will do a warm handoff
so the person seeking services does not have to make several phone calls and repeat their situation. We
continue to collaborate with our agency partners in finding ways to better serve our community.
TRAINING, MOBILITY, ELIGIBILITY AND COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT:
Over the past three months in Customer Care we have logged a total of 341.25 hours of various kinds of
trainings, including visits to agency partners, webinar’s, internal trainings and TSI professional trainings.
Mobility completed 37 mobility device assessments, which is evidence that more and more of our
passengers are using mobility devices which is having a profound effect on our service as we continue to
provide service to our most vulnerable population. Nine individuals were successfully travel trained to
ride line service, two internal functional assessments were completed, with one group training, and three
community outreach events were attended.
Team members from Customer Care attending many meetings and events in the month including,
preparing for Stand Down for Homeless Veterans, wrap up from Senior Summit, Mayor Horrigan’s
Senior Citizens Commission, an AMHA ADA Appeals Hearing, State of the County, Food Coalition,
Community Action event, ASCA Head Start/Early Head Start Orientation Health Fairs, Project Search new
participant orientation, Senior Independent Living Council meeting, Direction Home Coordinated Intake
Pilot Program and METRO’s 50th Birthday Party.

 RECORDS MANAGEMENT POLICY
I.

SCOPE
Records management is an administrative technique based on the planned control of
records, whether in hard copy or machine accessible media.
METRO’s Record Management Program will encompass the following areas:
A.
B.
C.
D.

II.

the surveying of records within the various departments of METRO on a
continuing basis;
the establishment of records retention periods based on operating, historical,
research, audit, Ohio Revised Code and other applicable requirements;
the designation of a records storage area for inactive records; and
the creation of forms to be used for records management.

OBJECTIVES
The overall objective of this Records Management Program is to provide for the effective
scheduling, retention, retrieval, and deposition of all METRO records.
Specific objectives of this Program are to:
A.

B.

C.
D.
E.
F.

G.
H.
III.

identify each filing unit of records; determine the value of said records with
respect to maintenance, retention, transfer, storage, microfilming, and other
graphic technology and destruction;
establish in-office, and total retention requirements for each filing unit based on
operating, historical, research, audit, Ohio Revised Code, and other legal
requirements;
reduce operating cost through the economical storage of inactive records;
assure prompt disposal of records as their retention periods expire;
implement a system of retrieval that will provide efficient access to active and
inactive records and specialty files;
implement a vital records protection program by providing adequate protective
facilities for records that are critical to the continuation or reestablishment of
business should a major disaster occur;
provide for a continuous evaluation of record keeping system, techniques, and
technological advances; and
comply with all appropriate Federal, State, and Local Laws and regulations.

RESPONSIBILITIES
A.

Records Management Support Staff
The records management support staff, consisting of the Executive Assistant, the
Executive Director and the Direct of Finance and any of their designees, shall:

27

 •

•
•
•

•
•

B.

administer the Records Management Program in conformity with
governmental and legal requirements as well as METRO’s operations,
long-range, and historical needs to assure the development of retention
schedules commensurate with these needs and requirements;
publish and maintain the guidelines to be used for records management;
determine the useful life of each type of record based on the needs and
efficient operation of METRO;
review each department’s records maintenance, operations and make
recommendations to assure compliance with records management policies
and procedures;
maintain control and disposal (with approval from the Ohio Historical
Connection) of inactive records; and
maintain liaison with governmental agencies, committee, and professional
organizations to stay abreast of current regulations and new developments
in the field of records management.

Legal Counsel
METRO’s legal counsel shall:
•
•

•

IV.

periodically review METRO’s records retention schedule to verify that
retention periods meet legal statutory requirements;
advise appropriate department personnel and the records management staff
of the need to hold records beyond their scheduled disposal date because
of pending litigation, enforcement proceedings, or other matters covered
by duly served process of any court or administrative authority; and
review new records not specifically designated in METRO’s record
retention schedule to be submitted to the Ohio Historical Connection for
approval for destruction.

MAINTENANCE OF THE RECORDS MANAGEMENT PROGRAM
A.

Record and Non-Record Materials
Record material shall be any information, regardless of physical form or
characteristic, that was created or received by METRO in the course of
transacting its business and that is appropriate for preservation because of its
evidentiary or informational value.
A record is any paper, book, photograph, microfilm, map, drawing, chart, card,
magnetic tape/disk or any other form of electronic media, or any copy or printout
thereof, which has been generated or received by METRO and has been used as
evidence of activities and business transactions.

28

 Non-record material shall be any information, which has no documentary or
evidentiary value, and which need not be filed or retained once the transactions
have been completed. Examples of such material may be:
•
Extra copies of papers preserved only for convenience or
reference;
•
Processed or published materials received from other organizations
which require no action and are not required for documentary
purposes;
•
Catalogs, trade journals, and other publications or papers received
from other firms, which require no action and are not part of a case
upon which action is taken by the firm;
•
Shorthand notes and disks, which have been transcribed; or
•
Informational copies of correspondence and other papers on which
no administrative action is required.
B.

Record Retention Requirements
A retention period is a specific period of time during which records are to be
retained to meet operating, historical, research, audit, Ohio Revised Code, and
other legal requirements. The record retention schedule for METRO is attached
as Exhibit A.
The Records Management Program also provides for the retention of information
stored on other media besides paper, which would include microforms, and
electronic processing tapes and disks. Appropriately established records retention
periods are based on operating, historical, research, audit, Ohio Revised Code,
and other legal requirements. Any one of the above can override the others for
retention purposes. Therefore, the appropriate department head, METRO’s record
management staff, counsel, as well as the Ohio Historical Connection must
approve records retention periods.
Disposal and destruction procedures are suspended for records in case of
foreseeable pending or actual litigation or governmental investigation.

C.

Keeping Records Retention Schedules Current
Records will be evaluated on a continuing basis. Particular consideration must be
given to the records retention schedules when procedural or retention changes
occur. Activities relative to continuing evaluation include the following:
•

•

The appropriately appointed individual within each department
will advise the Records Management Staff when there is a change
in the status of existing records;
Records will be reviewed annually to keep retention periods
current, to dispose of worthless records, and to retire inactive
records to the records center;

29

 •

•

The records management staff will be responsible for updating the
existing records survey analysis form whenever necessary. In
some instances where extensive changes are required, it may be
necessary to complete a new form; and
Each department will review its records on an annual basis to:
•
Retain appropriate records in its office.
•
Retire to the records center inactive records that are to be
retained.
•
Add new records to the retention schedules.
•
Delete discontinued records from the retention schedules.
•
Make modifications to the retention schedules when
changes occur.
•
Send all changes and updates to the records management
staff.
