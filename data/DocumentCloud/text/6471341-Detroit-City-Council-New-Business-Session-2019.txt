LAWSUIT SETTLEMENT MEMORANDUM

Warwick, Robin City of Detroit and Julia Harris and Devonte Wheatley
17-016552-NI

 

 

 

 

 

L17-00795
RG
NAME: Robin Warwick
DATE OF INCIDENT: August 10, 2017
TIME OF INCIDENT: 9:30 p.m.

 

LOCATION OF INCIDENT: Curtis and Appoline

SUMMARY OF INCIDENT:
On August 10, 2017, Plaintiff, Robin Warwick, was a passenger on a DDOT bus. As the

bus was traveling eastbound on Appoline, a motorist disregarded a stop sign, T-boning the bus
near the rear door on the passenger side of the bus.

MEDICAL TREATIVIENTIDIAGNOSIS:
Plaintiff did not take EMS to a hospital following the accident. Instead, she walked home.

Later, Plaintiff claimed injuries to her back, neck, hip, and leg. Plaintiff also treated for depression
and headaches, despite not claiming any injury to her head.

Plaintiff?s medical history is signi?cant for depression and Lupus. Plaintiff has been fully
disabled by the Social Security Administration since 2007 for those ailments.

CASE EVALUATION: $19,000.00



In accordance with the Michigan No Fault Act, the City is liable for payment of First Party
Personal Injury Protection (PIP) bene?ts to individuals injured by, or on?board, a City bus while
it is being used as a mode of transport. However, a claimant must show that he has no other
applicable automobile insurance. Whether the City?s vehicle was operated in a negligent manner
is immaterial for the purposes of a PIP claim seeking reimbursement for economic loss.

Plaintiff had no auto insurance coverage and was injured on the bus while it was being used
as a motor vehicle. Accordingly, the City is liable for payment of bene?ts. These bene?ts include
?all reasonable charges incurred for reasonably necessary products, services and accommodations
for an injured person?s care, recovery or rehabilitation.? Failure to pay the bene?ts within 30 days
after receipt of proof of loss subjects the City to liability for statutory penalty interest and attorney
fees.

At Case Evaluation, Plaintiff requested an award of $63,768.84. An experienced case
evaluation panel considered this matter and ?xed its value at $19,000.00, which the City both
parties rejected. At Facilitation, Plaintiff added an additional $56,315.00 physical therapy bill and

a $38,244.48 transportation bill. Plaintiff agreed to accept settlement in the amount of $35,000.00
with a waiver of all future PIP bene?ts. The amount of unpaid benefits in this case is disputed, and
would be a question for a jury. Similarly, it would be a question for a jury whether bene?ts should
have been terminated in this case, and whether medical bills that accrued after termination were
reasonable and necessary. Settlement insulates the City from the expense of a trial, and from a
potentially higher adverse verdict. It also eliminates the possibility of additional expense in the
form of taxable costs, which would include 12% interest and attorney fees as provided for by the
law. Settlement also prohibits Plaintiff from seeking any future medical bene?ts based on this
incident. Consequently, settlement of this case is recommended.

AMOUNT OF SETTLEMENT
RECOMMENDED: $35,000.00 with future bene?ts

RISK MANAGEMENT
MEASURES:
None.
