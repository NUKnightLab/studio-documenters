CHICAGO DEPARTMENT OF AVIATION (“CDA”) REPORT
A. Status of the Midway Part 150 Study Update
Assistant Commissioner Frame stated that the final draft of the Part 150 Noise
Compatibility Study update, announced last January, was turned into the FAA on
Monday, April, 22, 2013. The FAA has 180 days to review and provide approval.
October will make 180 days but approval may come sooner. If approved before
the next meeting in July, Mr. Frame will notify all of the members.
Once the FAA has approved the draft document, a new resolution will be
presented to the Commission asking that the new contour be adopted for use in
the Residential Sound Insulation Program.
Chairman Baliga thanked Mr. Frame and all of his staff for the hard work that
went into updating the Part 150 Study. Mr. Frame stated that letters of support
were received from Congressman Lipinski, Alderman Quinn and Alderman
Zalewski. These letters along with the letter from the Commission are included in
the document submitted which is available for viewing online.

Airline Fleet Mix Report
The first quarter fleet mix of 2013 was similar to that of the 4th quarter 2012.
Average operations were at 587 with 45 being at night.
Southwest Airlines had an average of 390 operations per day, followed by
General Aviation with 121, Delta with 37, then AirTran, Porter, Volaris and
Frontier. Southwest flies the B737’s with an average of 395 operations per day.
The remaining aircraft are Stage 3 which are quieter aircraft. There was an
average total of 45 operations per night.
Permanent Noise Monitor Locations
Per the Commission’s request, the addresses of all of the noise monitors are now
displayed on both the map and the Aircraft Noise Report. The report indicates
the monthly and quarterly noise level breakdowns.
The report shows the locations of the noise monitors and their noise values. It
indicates 12 month rolling numbers. There were no major changes in noise
values which were due to very little change in operations or fleet mix.
Noise Hotline Report
The number of noise complaints decreased from 175 in the 4th quarter of 2012 to
66 in the 1st quarter of 2013. Eleven of them were nighttime.
C. Hourly Operations and Ground Run-Up Reports
Per the Commission’s request the two special analysis reports are based on
averages using the 1st Quarter 2013 numbers.

 Final Minutes of the April 25, 2013, Meeting of the
Midway Noise Compatibility Commission
Hourly Operations
Mr. Jackson stated that the Hourly Operations Report shows the departures were
at a minimum from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. There were 4 at 10 p.m., 1 at 11 and 12
p.m., and none again until 1 at 5 a.m. Normal departure operations resumed at 6
a.m. Daytime departures ran from 13 to 22 per hour.
Arrivals followed a similar pattern with 7 arrivals at 10 p.m., 5 at 11 p.m., 3 at
midnight, 1 at 1 a.m. and nothing again until 1 at 5 a.m. and 4 at 6 a.m. Normal
arrival operations resumed at 7 a.m. Daytime arrivals ran from 11 to 24 per hour.
Ms. Dulaj asked if this only pertained to passenger operations and Mr. Jackson
replied that it included all operations.
Ground Run-Ups Report
Ground run-ups are usually what mechanics do after testing or maintenance of
an aircraft engine. Airport Operations maintains restrictions and policies
governing the times and locations run-ups can take place and all carriers are
aware of them. Both Operations and the Midway Tower must be contacted
before performing any run-up.
During the first quarter of 2013 there was a higher utilization. There were 70 runups performed. The average annual number is around 200.
Ms. Dulaj asked if there is a noise wall that runs around the area. Mr. Jackson
replied that there is and that he can provide another exhibit that indicates where
the noise walls have been placed.
CHAIR’S REPORT
A. Residential Sound Insulation Sub-Committee Report
Ms. Conwell presented the Residential Sound Insulation Sub-Committee Report
(see attached).
Chairman Baliga inquired whether there were any questions concerning the
Chair’s Report. Mr. Lihosit pointed out a discrepancy regarding the number of
homes in the contract. Mr. Frame responded that the 350 was a typographical
error which should read 250 and will be corrected by the next meeting.
NEW BUSINESS
Chairman Baliga asked if there were any additional questions, or any business requiring
further discussion. He also asked if there were any topics anyone would like to see
included in the next quarterly meeting.

 Final Minutes of the April 25, 2013, Meeting of the
Midway Noise Compatibility Commission
Mr. Frame mentioned that he included a fully updated copy of the School Sound
Insulation Program brochure in the members’ packets. It states that 41 schools were
sound-insulated over the last 18 years (since 1993) at a cost of $105M in federal and
airport funds. Although there are no additional schools in the new contour, school
sound insulation was still included in the new Draft Part 150.
Chairman Baliga asked what would warrant another noise study in the future if noise
conditions changed. Mr. Frame responded that most of the key parameters were
provided by the FAA based on the best available information and nationally published
forecasts. If a trend is detected in the future, that is not within the noise contour that
was produced, that would be cause for the CDA to perform a special analysis. If it
resulted in a long-term trend, the Commission would be advised to submit a formal letter
to the CDA. If the trend continued a letter to the FAA would be warranted asking them
to confirm that the assumptions are still true. Mr. Frame noted that a change would be
extremely rare. The noise model that has been perfected by the FAA over several
decades is very accurate and used nationwide.
Mr. Frame elaborated on Ms. Conwell’s remarks about the accomplishments of the
Sound Program. He stated that there are very few airports in the country that have
sound-insulated 7,000 to 8,000 homes like the Midway Program has to date. He also
mentioned that the federal funds are reimbursement grants. The airport is required to
procure 100% of the money upfront, which includes passenger facility charges. Eighty
percent of the cost is reimbursable through the federal grants.
With no other business, a motion to adjourn was made by Ms. Pinion and seconded by
Ms. Conwell. The motion passed.
MEETING ADJOURNMENT
Chairman Baliga adjourned the meeting at 7:08 p.m. and informed all those present that
the next meeting of the Midway Noise Compatibility Commission will be held on
Thursday, July 25, 2013 at 6:30 p.m. at The Mayfield, Chicago.
