In April 2012, CHA received notice of a grant award not-to-exceed $800,000 from DFSS to
provide stipends for 1,280 youth and young adults ages 14-24 to participate in a SYEP. With
funding from DFSS, the SYEP is being implemented as a part of One Summer Chicago, which is
a collaborative effort between the City of Chicago, Cook County and the civic and business
communities to provide summer programming for youth. The DFSS grant agreement with DFSS
stipulates that the grant funds may only be used for youth worker stipends.

Accordingly, CHA must match the grant funding from DFSS to cover the cost of program
coordination, implementation and supervision. The goals of the SYEP are aligned with 
corporate strategy, including creating healthy and strong communities and helping families
maximize their potential. Speci?cally, Resident Services Division is seeking to authorize
a total of $1,600,000 for the DFSS SYEP to be utilized as follows:

0 The total $800,000 from the DFSS grant funds to pay stipends to 1,280 youth
workers;

0 Enter into contracts with CNH, EES, HHCS, MFS, NWS and UCAN for the
remaining balance in an aggregate amount not-to-exceed $800,000 to administer
the SYEP for the period of June 1, 2012 through September 30, 2012.

Program Model Bene?t to Participants
The SYEP is a youth summer training, skill development and employment opportunity for 14 

24 year olds. The intention of the SYEP is to provide Chicago youth and young adults with safe,
meaningful summer experiences, while learning valuable and transferable skills that connect life
lessons and academic preparation, ultimately enhancing participants? long-term employment
prospects. Speci?cally, Cl-lA will utilize the DFSS grant funds to place 1,200 youth age 14-20
in employment positions and 80 young adults age 21-24 in supervisory roles. Youth workers
will participate in a variety of employment opportunities, including, but not limited to,
technology, ?green? jobs, retail, and landscaping/gardening.

Participants will be engaged up-to 20 hours per week for 6-weeks. The anticipated term for the
program is July 9, 2012 through August 17, 2012. Participants will spend up-to 12 hours per
week engaging directly in employment activities at the assigned worksite and up-to eight (8)
program hours per week on educational and so? skills training. Certain placements may allow

for more working hours and fewer soft skills training hours. All participants will complete an
assessment with their FamilyWorks provider to assess basic skills and identify career interests in
order to match youth with appropriate work sites. FamilyWorks? ongoing relationships within
the commtmities allow them to find meaningful employment for youth participants.

Quali?ed and experienced FamilyWorks staff will provide job readiness training to SYEP
participants including but not be limited to, resume development, behavior in the workplace,
interview skills, time management, effective communication and technology literacy. Young
adult supervisors will receive additional training from the FamilyWorks providers in such tOpics
including interpersonal communication, con?ict resolution, team building and problem solving
prior to engaging with youth workers.

Youth participants will receive a stipend up to $600 (based on attendance) for successfully
completing the program and young adult supervisors will receive up to $1,000 (based on
attendance). Resident Services will assign slots to each of the named agencies based on the
number of youth on their assigned caseload. CI-IA will utilize a third party payroll vendor to
administer the stipend payments for the participants.

CHA staff, along with the FamilyWorks agencies, will conduct pre-program site visits to ensure
safe work environments. Site visits by CI-IA staff will also be conducted on a weekly basis to
monitor program conditions and troubleshoot any identi?ed issues.

ntra Bac und

The Contractors recommended to implement the Program will be responsible for identifying
worksites, recruiting, assessing and placing youth workers, providing job readiness training,
training for youth supervisors and providing additional supervision and program administration
as necessary. existing case management providers, CNH, BBS, HHCS, MFS, NWS and
UCAN, are the only agencies that have established relationships with the target population and
possess the requisite experience in providing similar youth summer workforce programs, as these
providers have been responsible for coordinating other similar grant-?mded workforce programs
for CHA youth since 2009. Through previous similar programs, FamilyWorks agencies
have identi?ed and developed worksite agreements with hundreds of employers that have
provided more than 3,300 CI-IA youth with summer jobs from 2009 through 2011.

Conclusion

Based upon the foregoing, it is in the best interest of CHA to authorize the Chief Executive
Of?cer or his designee to accept a grant award and execute a grant agreement with the City of
Chicago Department of Family and Support Services in the amount of $800,000 for
the SYEP, and to increase the FY 2012 comprehensive budget by the same amount. This grant
award from DFSS can only be utilized to pay stipends for 1,280 youth workers. Therefore, it is
further recommended that the Board authorize the Chief Executive Of?cer or his designee to
enter into contracts with CNH, EES, HHCS, MF S, NWS, and UCAN in an additional aggregate
amount not-to-exceed $800,000 to implement and administer the DFSS SYEP for a 4 month
period from June 1, 2012 through September 30, 2012.
