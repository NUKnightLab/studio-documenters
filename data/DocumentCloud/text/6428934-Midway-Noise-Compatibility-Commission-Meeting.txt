Permanent Noise Monitor Locations
The report indicates the addresses of the 13 permanent noise monitor locations
near the airport as reflected in relation to the Midway 2018 Noise Contour. The

 FINAL Minutes of the January 28, 2016, Meeting of the
Midway Noise Compatibility Commission
CHAIR’S REPORT
A. Residential Sound Insulation Sub-Committee Report
Mr. Lihosit presented the Residential Sound Insulation Sub-committee Report
(see attached). Chairman Baliga asked if the work is on schedule for meeting
the goals and Mr. Frame stated that the pace is very aggressive and confirmed
that completion is anticipated by spring.
NEW BUSNESS
A. Group Photograph
Chairman Baliga called for a 10 minute recess for a group photograph for the
website.
Ms. Dulaj motioned in favor of the recess, and the motion was seconded by Mr.
Lihosit. The motion passed.
The photographs were taken and the meeting reconvened.
B. Election of Chair and Vice-Chair for 2016
The meeting was turned over to Mr. Lombaer of the Chicago Department of Law
to conduct the elections.
Mr. Baliga was nominated for Chair by Mr. Lihosit. Votes were cast and Mr.
Baliga was re-elected Chairman for 2016.
Mr. Lombaer then opened the floor for nominations for Vice-Chair. Mr. Lihosit
nominated Mayor Harry Klein for Vice-Chair. Votes were cast and Mayor Klein
was re-elected Vice-Chair for 2016.
C. Late renewals of Intergovernmental Agreements
Mr. Frame stated there are nine suburban members of the Commission. Five of
the nine member agreements were received before December 31, 2015. Those
five were automatically renewed upon counter signature by the City. Late
renewals require a majority vote to reinstate their membership. Neither Cicero
nor Cook County have been heard from. The Village of Lyons gave notice stating
that its IGA is forthcoming. Although the Village of Forest View’s IGA was
received after December 31st, the IGA allows for late renewals as long as there is
a majority vote. A village representative was present at the meeting, therefore
Mr. Frame requested that a motion be made to reinstate their membership.
Chairman Baliga made the motion and it was seconded by Ms. Dulaj. The
motion passed and Forest View was reinstated. Mr. Frame noted that once the
agreement from Lyons has been received a vote to reinstate can be made at the
April 2016 meeting.

 FINAL Minutes of the January 28, 2016, Meeting of the
Midway Noise Compatibility Commission
D. CDA request for Commission approval for destruction of meeting
recordings older than 18 months
Mr. Frame requested Commission approval to destroy the remaining two meeting
recordings on compact disc. He read the Open Meetings Act which states the
guidelines to be implemented in the recording destruction. The CDA requested
that the CD recordings, the minutes of which were approved by the Commission,
be destroyed. The recordings are a minimum of 33 months old, which is beyond
the 18 month requirement made by the Open Meetings Act. All minutes are
digitally recorded and are now stored electronically and have been uploaded to
the CDA website. Mayor Klein made the motion for their destruction which was
seconded by Ms. Dulaj. The motion passed.
E.

Review of bylaws
Now that the Intergovernmental Agreement has been updated, Mr. Frame
recommended that the Executive Committee meet to review and update the
current Commission bylaws. He suggested that a meeting be scheduled
sometime before the next meeting in April.

F.

Planning for the celebration of the Commission’s 20th anniversary
The City Council approved an ordinance in February 1996 and the first MNCC
meeting was held in June of 1996. The CDA thought it appropriate to celebrate
the Commission’s public service along with the accomplishments of the Noise
Program. The CDA is planning a luncheon celebration event in June or July and
would like feedback and suggestions from the Commission. Members can
contact Mr. Frame with any ideas they may have.

MEETING ADJOURNMENT
Chairman Baliga asked if there were any further questions or new business requiring
further discussion.
Chairman Baliga stated that in the October 22, 2015 meeting he requested that a
meeting be arranged with the Executive Board and the FAA regarding the flight paths.
Mr. Frame is following up and will provide an update as soon as he has heard back from
the FAA.
With no further questions or other new business, a motion to adjourn was made by Mr.
Loduca and seconded by Mr. Ponio. The motion passed. Chairman Baliga adjourned
the meeting at 7:05 p.m. and informed those present that the next meeting of the
