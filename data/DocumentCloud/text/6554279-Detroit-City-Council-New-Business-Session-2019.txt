1 The following pages outline general questions and performance measures for the Bureau of Justice
Assistance (BJA) and BFDI - Violent Gang and Gun Crime Reduction (also known as Project Safe
Neighborhoods; PSN) Grant Program.

A PSN evaluation, funded by the National Institute of Justice and conducted by Michigan State University
(MSU), found that PSN target cities achieved a 4.1 percent decline in violent crime compared to a 0.9
percent decline in non-target cities and of the PSN sites for which case studies were conducted, 8 out of 10
experienced statistically significant reductions in violent crime, ranging from 2 percent to 42 percent. Key
factors for success included U.S. Attorney's Office leadership, cross-agency buy?in, and the ?exibility of the
program to adjust to the realities of individual jurisdictions.

Drawing on the results of evaluation, goal is to reduce gun and gang violence by the most
violent individuals in target neighborhoods by employing a research-driven, intelligence?led, and problem?
solving approach to reducing firearm and gang violence through enforcement, deterrence, and prevention.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES
- OBJECTIVE 1: Establish and expand evidence?based programming in PSN task forces so that they can
effectively and sustainably prevent and respond to gun and gang crime.

- OBJECTIVE 2: Create and maintain coordination among Federal, State, local, and tribal law enforcement
and prosecution officials; researchers; social service providers; and community members with an
emphasis on prevention, tactical intelligence gathering, more vigorous and strategic prosecutions of
gun and gang crimes, and enhanced accountability.

. STRUCTURE OF THE QUESTIONNAIRE

The PSN Grant Program questionnaire contains performance measures and narrative (goals and objectives)
questions. Complete the performance measures in the BJA BFDI Performance Measurement Tool (PMT)
four times per year to report on your activity during the prior 3 months, also known as a reporting period.
Complete the goals and objectives questions twice each year.

ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES FOR COMPLETION

BJA and expectation is that the person completing these questions will know the status and progress
of all aspects of your PSN program. Therefore, your agency?s PSN coordinator/grantee point of contact (or
another designated person with working knowledge of the PSN project) should complete these questions
on your PSN initiative's behalf. Your agency may also need to consult with BFDI, the PSN research partner
and other partner agencies to complete these responses.

will upload into the Grants Management System (GMS). This is the GMS report. During the non-submission
reporting periods, you are encouraged to create reports for your records, but you will not upload them to
the GMS. Enter your responses to the questions that follow in the PMT. If you have any questions about
the PMT or performance measures, please call BFDI's PSN Program Manager? Kevin Bryant at 313-758-

Congratulations on your recent award! The Of?ce for Civil Rights (OCR), Of?ce of Justice Programs U.S. Department of

discrimination prohibited by hw. Several federal civil rights laws, such is Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of I964 and Title IX of
the Education Amendments of 1972, require recipients of federal ?nancial assistance to give assurances that they will comply with
those laws. in addition to those civil rights laws. may grant program statutes contain nondiscrimination provisions that require
compliance with them as a condition of receiving federal ?nancial assistance. For a complete review of these civil rights laws and
nondiscrimination requirements. in connection with Oll? and other DOJ awards, see


Under the delegation ofauthon'ty, the OCR investigates allegations of discrimination against recipients from individuals. entities. or
groups. In addition. the OCR conducts limited compliance reviews and audits based on regulatory criteria. These reviews and audits
permit the OCR to evaluate whether recipients of ?nancial assistance from the Department are providing services in a non-
discriminatory manncr to their service population or have employment practices that meet equal-opportunity sandards.

If you are a recipient of grant awards under the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act or the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency
Prevention Act and your agency is pan ot'a criminal justice system, there are two additional obligations that may apply in connection
with the awards: complying with the regulation relating to Equal Employment Opportunity Programs and (2)
submitting ?ndings ofdiscrimination to OCR For additional information regarding the EEOP requirement. see 28 CFR Fan 42.
suhpart E, and for additional information regarding requirements when there is an adverse ?nding. see 28 C.F.R.

We at the OCR are available to help you and your organization meet the civil rights requirements that are associated with OJP and

other grant funding. If you would like the OCR to assist you in ful?lling your organization's civil rights or nondiscrimination
responsibilities as a recipient of federal ?nancial assistance. please do not hesitate to let us know.

Memorandum To: Of?cial Grant File
From: Orbin Terry, NEPA Coordinator

Subject: Categorical Exclusion for City of Detroit

The Innovations in Community-Based Crime Reduction Program (CBCR) will target hot spots of crime where a
signi?cant proportion ofcrime occurs as compared to the overall jurisdiction. CBCR furthers the Department's
mission by leading efforts to enhance the capacity of local and tribal communities to effectively target and address
signi?cant crime issues through collaborative cross-sector approaches that help advance broader neighborhood
development goals. Awards under this program will focus on funding Planning and implementation efforts.

None of the following activities will be conducted whether under the Of?ce of Justice Programs federal action or a
related third party action:

I New construction.

(2) Any renovation or remodeling ofa property located in an environmentally or historically sensitive area,
including property listed on or eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places, or located
within a lOO-year flood plain, a wetland, or habitat for an endangered species.

(3) A renovation that will change the basic prior use of a facility or signi?cantly change its size.

(4) Research and technology whose anticipated and future application could be expected to have an effect on the
environment.

(5) Implementation of a program involving the use of chemicals.

Additionally, the proposed action is neither a phase nor a segment of a project that when reviewed in its entirety
would not meet the criteria for a categorical exclusion.

Consequently, the subject federal action meets the Of?ce of Justice Programs? criteria for a categorical exclusion
as contained in paragraph 4(b) of Appendix to Part 61 of Title 28 of the Code of Federal Regulations.
