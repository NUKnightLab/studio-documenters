Emily Barton presented the staff’s recommendation that the Commission: (A) Find that,

Preliminarily find that the subject building, a 2-story masonry, commercial building
constructed prior to 1911, with 2-story addition constructed before 1950; contributes to the
character of the Motor Row District, which provides an excellent illustration of the early
development of the American automobile industry and features the largest intact collection of
early automobile dealerships and related businesses in the United States; and (C)
Preliminarily find that the demolition of a contributing building or structure within a
landmark district is a per se adverse effect on the significant historical and architectural
features, pursuant to Article III, Section G.3.b., of the Rules and Regulations; and (D)

demolition of the subject property will adversely affect and destroy significant historical and
architectural features of the property and the district; and (E) Issue a preliminary decision
