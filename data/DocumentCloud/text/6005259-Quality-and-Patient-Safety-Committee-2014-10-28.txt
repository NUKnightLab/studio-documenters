Report from System Chief Quality Officer
A. Regulatory and Accreditation Updates
Dr. Krishna Das, System Chief Quality Officer, provided updates on the following subjects.
Dr. Das stated that the visit from the surveyors from The Joint Commission at Provident Hospital is
expected soon. She noted that they should have been here by now; she anticipates that they will be here
soon.
A biannual survey is expected to take place on November 19th, relating to the Perinatal Network; Stroger
Hospital receives transfers of high-risk neonates as a result of participating in the Network.
A biannual survey of laboratory services by the College of American Pathology is expected to take place
soon. A team of approximately ten (10) people is expected; they will be divided up amongst all the
different aspects of laboratory services. Dr. Das indicated that the results of the past two (2) surveys have
been very good.
Dr. Das stated that surveyors from the U.S. Department of Justice are expected at Cermak Health Services
next week to review the compliance in progress with the Agreed Order. Preparations are underway for that.

Report from System Chief Quality Officer
A. Regulatory and Accreditation Updates (continued)
In response to a question from Mr. Driscoll regarding the System’s progress to achieve substantial
compliance with the Agreed Order, Peter Daniels, Chief Operating Officer, Hospital-Based Services,
responded that, of the approximately thirty (30) items in the Agreed Order, half of them are in substantial
compliance, and the other half are in partial compliance. Chairman Collens remarked that the status appears
to be the same as it was at the last inspection; he inquired further regarding the plan for this visit, and the
plan or timetable to achieve substantial compliance on all items. Mr. Daniels stated that, with this visit,
there are a few items that they are addressing in terms of access to care; they have a number of plans that
they have currently put in place that relate to that. Mr. Daniels stated that the surveyors visit every six (6)
months; there is no timetable with regard to the surveyors, other than the fact that the entity has to
demonstrate substantial compliance over an eighteen (18) month period. He added that staff are working on
all of those items that are in partial compliance; addressing these types of items are typically multi-year
efforts. He stated that, following this next survey, staff can return to the Board to provide a update in terms
of what that actual plan is for each partial compliance item1.
Board Chairman Hammock inquired whether there are any items that fall under the category of noncompliance. Mr. Daniels responded that he was not aware of any under that category.
Director Gugenheim inquired whether a proportion of the items relate to staffing issues. Mr. Daniels
responded affirmatively; he stated that a piece of it relates to mental health and nursing. Corrective action
plans are now in place in terms of improving staffing in both of those categories, including looking at a
number of other programs, such as telepsychiatry and bringing in locum tenens to help support the mental
health programs.
Additionally, Dr. Das informed the Committee that The Joint Commission has come out with a new chapter
regarding patient safety. There are no new requirements, but within one chapter, it has integrated a variety
of standards that are relevant to patient safety. Staff have compared the Patient Safety Plan which was
approved at the last meeting with the Joint Commission standards; they were found to be highly aligned.

B. Publicly Reported Ratings
There was nothing to report on this subject at this time.
C. ACHN Quality Plan Discussion (Attachment #1)
Dr. Das reviewed a presentation relating to planned metrics for the Quality Plan for the Ambulatory and
Community Health Network of Cook County (ACHN). She noted that the Quality Plan is expected to be
presented for approval next month. The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
In response to a question from Director Gugenheim regarding the differences between the two certification
bodies, The Joint Commission (TJC) and the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA), Dr. Das
stated that there are qualitative differences between TJC and NCQA certification. The overall goals are
very similar, in fact they are both fairly complex at this point; they have increased in complexity over the
last few years and have built in many more targets. TJC certification was chosen by the administration
because areas within the System are already certified by TJC; it helps to integrate this with the rest of the
System’s certification efforts and is more efficient.

Report from System Chief Quality Officer
C. ACHN Quality Plan Discussion (continued)
Dr. Das stated that she does not know if there are any plans to merge or achieve one uniform standard
between TJC and NCQA. She thought that some of the major regulatory bodies have been evolving over
the last several years to try to achieve consistency over various indicators and standards, but she could not
comment on whether or not that will happen between TJC and NCQA.
Mr. Driscoll inquired regarding the general business hours of the clinics. Debra Carey, Chief Operating
Officer of Ambulatory Services, stated that the clinics have standard hours, Monday through Friday. Many
of the centers have what they call “late night” hours a couple of days per week; on those days, their hours
are usually 10:00 A.M. to 6:00 or 7:00 P.M. Ms. Carey stated that, in September, Saturday hours were
added for a couple of Saturdays per month; in the future, possibly late next year, they anticipate being open
every Saturday.
The Committee discussed information contained on slide 9 of the presentation, regarding the objective of
performing medication reconciliation and the 50% threshold requirement. Dr. Das explained that,
essentially, her guess is that every provider looks at every medication that their patient is taking. That is
standard of care – the provider has to consider what the patient is taking when the provider completes the
visit and writes any prescriptions. Medication reconciliation adds the additional request of documentation
that this comparison is made; that is the part that is a little more cumbersome, although within the
information system she believes that the administration has done a good job of making it as easy as possible
for providers to do this.
In response to a question from Director Junge regarding whose responsibility it is to complete the depart
summary (also referenced on slide 9 of the presentation), Dr. Das responded that it is considered to be a
collaboration between physicians, nurses and medical assistants in the clinics. Parts of the depart summary
may be populated by the providers; ultimately, the provider may print it, or if the provider did not print it or
if there is some reason to delay the printing, nursing staff may print it, as well.
Dr. John Jay Shannon, Chief Executive Officer, provided additional comments. He stated that discussions
have been held about the fact that the plan for the organization moving forward is built on the medical home
model. This is the reason, for instance, why the System is folding the Public Health clinics into the ACHN
network clinics; this is the right thing to do for individuals, so that they can get the wrap-around care that
they simply cannot get at a Public Health clinic. Secondly, the System is responding to the increasing
pressure, both from the patients served and from the payers, to show that it is doing a better job.
Dr. Das noted that an area she did not allude to, but hopes to include at a future meeting, is the discussion of
the alignment of the Ambulatory metrics with the CountyCare metrics. Staff are in the process of working
to set those metrics; in addition to other factors, they are awaiting guidance from the State about the
Medicaid measures. As soon as those are pinned down, the administration can look at alignment between
the two.
