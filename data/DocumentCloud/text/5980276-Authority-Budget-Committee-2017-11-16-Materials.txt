Opening Remarks
Executive Director Maki said that he attended a meeting of the Illinois Audit
Commission regarding the closure of the Community Violence Prevention Program and
the Neighborhood Recovery Initiative audits. He said that questions were raised as to
ICJIA’s efforts to prevent the issues uncovered in those audits. He said that given
ICJIA’s structure, the administrative details of proposed grants are attended to before
grants are recommended to the Budget Committee for designations. He said that the
Budget Committee should concern itself with higher level review of ICJIA activities.
Executive Director Maki said that state grant programs, unlike federal grant programs,
can be difficult to manage because there is often little or no lead time and staff has little
opportunity to prepare when state government makes program funding available. In July,
ICJIA received a new item in its General Revenue budget for Community-Based
Violence Intervention and Prevention (CBVIP) programs. While staff had not been
prepared for the receipt of funding for a new program of that size, Program Supervisor

 10/25/17 Budget Committee Meeting Minutes, Page 3

Shai Hoffman and other ICJIA staff put forth a tremendous effort to develop CBVIP
designation recommendations that are included in the materials for this meeting.
1. Minutes of the September 28, 2017, Budget Committee Meeting
Motion: Ms. Kramer moved to approve the minutes of the September 28, 2017, Budget
Committee Meeting. Ms. Vollen-Katz seconded the motion.
Ms. Kramer said that the motion described in the fourth paragraph on Page 4 of the
minutes should read (corrections in italics):
“Ms. Kramer moved to approve the recommended SFY18 IFVCC designations. Ms.
Wolff seconded the motion and the motion passed by unanimous voice vote. Ms.
Vollen-Katz said that she voted yes with the caveat the she would not do so again
without first knowing who all of the stakeholders are for each designation.”
Ms. Kramer said that the second sentence of the fourth paragraph on Page 5 of the
minutes should read (corrections in italics):
“Staff should be trusted regarding the allowability…”
Vote: The motion passed by unanimous voice vote.
2. Community-Based Violence Intervention and Prevention
Notice of Funding Opportunity
Program Supervisor Shai Hoffman called attention to a memo dated October 25, 2017,
on page 9 of the meeting materials regarding SFY18 funding for the Community-Based
Violence Intervention and Prevention (CBVIP) programs. He said a Notice of Funding
Opportunity for CBVIP programs was released on July 19, 2017. He said 71 applications
for funding were submitted. He described the application scoring and selection process.
He said that applicants were allowed to request funding amounts between $100,000 and
$1 million.
Ms. Hora said that setting minimum funding amounts can cause problems for smaller
agencies because some agencies might not need the minimum amount to effectively
implement or support a program.
Mr. Hoffman said that budget details of individual CBVIP grant agreements were still
being negotiated at the time of this meeting and may be revised downward from the
amounts recommended for designation.
Ms. Hora said that ICJIA has an obligation to consider opportunities on a statewide basis.
Perhaps technical assistance should be made available to the smaller agencies who lack
the personnel or expertise to craft a competitive application.

 10/25/17 Budget Committee Meeting Minutes, Page 4

Recommended Designations
Associate Director Givens called attention to the table on page 1 of the memo describing
maximum recommended designation amounts that would likely result in budgets and
agreements for lower amounts during the pre-award process. He said staff recommended
designating $6,840,000 in SFY18 funds to 14 entities to support programs that combat
community violence. He said that the entities in the table on page 2 of the memo would
only receive an award if there are funds available once award amounts are reduced for the
agencies listed on the table on page 1.
Motion: Ms. Dunne moved to approve the recommended SFY18 CBVIP designations.
Ms. Vollen-Katz seconded the motion.
Ms. Hora said that the materials presented in support of the CBVIP program appeared to
be similar to the materials that had been presented in support of the Neighborhood
Recovery Initiative (NRI). She said that she had concerns about effectively being asked
to trust staff’s discretion without having questions answered, particularly as no budget
information has been provided. She requested being on the record as not believing that
the Budget Committee should simply rubber-stamp everything; as believing that the
committee has a duty to review specific things and ask questions; as believing that two to
three sentences is rarely sufficient to describe designation proposals in the hundreds of
thousands of dollars; and she said that more time was needed for board members to
review the materials. She called attention to the text on Page 10 of the memo describing
the Springfield Urban League and said that she would have a hard time approving funds
to support community block parties because that sounds like the sort of thing on which
NRI grantees spent funds. She said that providing funds for employment opportunities
can yield dubious results. She said that as a Budget Committee member, she was
concerned about the lack of detail for some of the recommended designations. She said
that she needed more information on recommendations to designate millions of dollars on
programs that are likely to be heavily scrutinized.
Ms. Wolff said that she considers the role of ICJIA to be defining desired outcomes and
granting money to achieve those outcomes and then measuring whether or not those
outcomes have been met. She said that the language in the meeting materials is important,
but not as important as the guarantee from staff and the reviewers that the outcomes
described in the NOFO are met and that there is a rigorous evaluation and data collection
process so that we will be able, as Budget Committee members, to have assurances that
the stated goals have been met. A well-crafted application does not necessarily translate
into a desired outcome. She said that she would rely on staff and on the reviewers to
recommend for designation programs that they feel confident about with regard to the
likelihood of said programs achieving the outcomes described in the NOFO per the
information submitted in their applications. She said that there is an inherent degree of
risk involved in issuing any grant, but it is the fiduciary responsibility of the Budget
Committee to ask the staff questions about their confidence in their recommendations and
to ask about the processes and timing of outcome measurements.

 10/25/17 Budget Committee Meeting Minutes, Page 5

Ms. Barnes said that she appreciated Ms. Wolff’s comments because, for example, block
parties are a good way to conduct outreach in certain communities.
General Counsel Weis said that funds supporting block parties would only be used for
specific allowable purposes in support of the goals stated in the NOFO. Block parties can
be critical to performing this kind of work.
Executive Director Maki said that it is not realistic to expect staff to produce in-depth
recommendation reports that provide a lot of specific details given the timeframe with
which they had; from having the funds announced on short notice in July through
processing a notice of funding opportunity to presenting designation recommendations.
He said that the Budget Committee best serves the interests of ICJIA by asking high-level
questions and trusting staff to handle grant-specific detail issues.
Ms. Vollen-Katz said that the board’s role should be to oversee process and the board
should recognize that staff has subject-matter expertise that should be trusted. With
regard to the audit findings, she noted that ICJIA is now under different leadership and
grant-making is now subject to rules set forth in the Grant Accountability and
Transparency Act.
Discussion ensued regarding the details of specific designation recommendations.
Executive Director Maki encouraged board members to call the appropriate members of
ICJIA’s executive staff with any question that they might have regarding future meeting
materials so that staff can be better prepared to respond at the Budget Committee
meetings.
Vote: The motion passed by unanimous voice vote with an abstention by Ms. Hora.
3. Victims of Crime Act
Associate Director Givens called attention to a memo dated October 25, 2017, regarding
the FFY16 Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) Plan Adjustments. He said that in keeping
with the priorities identified by the Victim Services Ad Hoc Committee, staff
recommended designating $7,444,293 in FFY16 funds to the entities described in the
chart on Page 1 of the memo to support programs that combat community violence. He
called attention to the line item in the chart for the recommended designation to
Hektoen Institute, marked with and asterisk (*), and he said that at the time that this
memo was written, there were still unresolved issues regarding the contract negotiation,
therefore, no Grant Recommendation Report was included in the materials for Hektoen
Instititue. He said that staff recommended approving the designation to Hektoen
Institute with the caveat that the designation’s approval would be contingent on the
resolution of said contract issues. He said that staff requested permission to rescind this
designation if the contract issues are not resolved by December 1, 2017. He said that

6

 10/25/17 Budget Committee Meeting Minutes, Page 6

staff will provide the Hektoen Institute Grant Recommendation Report at the November
16, 2017 Budget Committee meeting.
General Counsel Weis recommended removing the Hektoen Institute line item
designation recommendation from the list of items under consideration in this agenda
item. She suggested postponing the Hektoen Institute designation recommendation until
the Budget Committee meeting scheduled for November 16, 2017 when it could be
properly presented with the necessary background information.
ICJIA Strategic Policy Advisor Reshma Desai said that the issue with the Hektoen
designation revolves around contractual issues between Hektoen and Stroger Hospital.
She said ICJIA’s legal staff wants to ensure that Hektoen is the entity responsible for
fiscal and programmatic oversight of the grant.
Motion: Ms. Vollen-Katz moved to approve the recommended FFY16 VOCA
designations, with the exception of the recommended designation to the Hektoen
Institute. She said it would be removed from this list of designations and presented for
approval at the November 16, 2017, Budget Committee meeting. Ms. Kramer seconded
the motion.
Ms. Hora said that there is a lot of misinformation regarding compensation programs. She
volunteered her staff to assist in conducting training sessions for new VOCA grantees so
that they have a good understanding of compensation.
Vote: The motion passed by unanimous voice vote.
4. Justice Assistance Grants
Associate Director Givens called attention to a memo dated October 25, 2017, regarding
the FFY14 and FFY16 Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) Plan Adjustments. He said that at
the July 27, 2017, Budget Committee meeting, the committee acted to reduce the FFY14
Justice Assistance Grant designation of $331,569 to the Illinois Department of
Corrections (IDOC) for its Community-Based Residential Treatment for Adults program
by $317,902, resulting in a revised designation of $13,667. The funds were later
reprogrammed.
He said staff had since learned that this designation reduction request was made in error;
the designation should have been reduced by $13,667 for a revised designation of
$317,902. Staff now recommends designating $304,235 in FFY14 funds to IDOC to
restore the designation to its correct amount of $317,902. To make $304,235 in FFY14
funds available to restore the IDOC’s designation, he said staff recommended rescinding
the $420,000 designation of FFY14 funds made to Haymarket Center at the July 27,
2017, Budget Committee meeting for its Women’s Residential Treatment program. He
said staff recommended re-designating the $420,000 for Haymarket’s program using
FFY16 funds. This would result in $115,765 in FFY14 funds being made available for
future programming, he said.

 10/25/17 Budget Committee Meeting Minutes, Page 7

Motion: Ms. Wolff moved to approve the recommended FFY14 and FFY16 JAG plan
adjustments. Ms. Vollen-Katz seconded the motion. The motion passed by unanimous
voice vote, with a recusal by Ms. Dunne.
5. Violence Against Women Act
Associate Director Givens called attention to a memo dated October 25, 2017, regarding
the FFY12 Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) Plan Adjustments. He said that the
Chicago Metropolitan Battered Women’s Network conducts a centralized training
program for Chicago-area domestic violence agencies that, each quarter, provides five
40-hour domestic violence training services to between 25 and 35 service providers and
15 advanced and specialized training services to between 150 and 200 service providers.
He said staff recommended a designation of $21,194 in FFY12 discretionary Violence
Against Women Act funds to the Chicago Metropolitan Battered Women’s Network to
continue this program for an additional 12 months.
Motion: Ms. Dunne moved to approve the recommended FFY12 VAWA plan
adjustment. Ms. Kramer seconded the motion. The motion passed by unanimous voice
vote.
6. Violence Against Women Act – Sexual Assault Service Program
Associate Director Givens called attention to a memo dated October 25, 2017, regarding
the FFY17 Violence Against Women Act – Sexual Assault Services Program (VAWA
SASP) Plan Introduction. He said that the FFY16 VAWA SASP award to Illinois was
$531,869 and $26,593 of that was set aside for administration purposes. He said the
designations recommended in this memo and future designations will be consistent with
the priorities set forth in the FFY17-FFY20 VAWA Multi-Year Plan. He said on January
10 and 11, 2017, ICJIA convened the Victim Service Ad Hoc Committee (VSAHC) to
review past priorities and define new ones for the use of STOP VAWA funds. He
explained he VSAHC recommended using FFY17-FFY20 VAWA funds principally to
continue to support successful programs previously funded through VAWA. The Sexual
Assault Services Formula Grant Program directs grant dollars to states and to assist them
in supporting rape crisis centers and other nonprofit, nongovernmental organizations that
provide core services, direct intervention, and related assistance to victims of sexual
assault, he said.
He said staff recommended designating $505,276 in FFY17 VAWA SASP funds to the
ICASA to be subgranted to ICASA’s partner agencies through a request-for-proposals
process. Due to the delayed receipt of this federal award, staff requested making the
designation retroactive to August 1, 2017, he said.
Motion: Ms. Dunne moved to approve the recommended FFY17 VAWA SASP plan
introduction. Ms. Wolff seconded the motion.

8

 10/25/17 Budget Committee Meeting Minutes, Page 8

Associate Director Givens said that ICASA will submit the request for proposals that it
develops to ICJIA for approval. ICASA has its own internal review process and, upon
completion of which, ICASA will submit to ICJIA a list of grant awardees. ICJIA staff
will conduct site visits at ICASA to ensure that ICASA is properly monitoring its
grantees, he said. ICJIA staff can monitor ICASA’s grantees if staff feels that it would be
necessary, he said.
General Counsel Weis said that ICJIA must approve of ICASA’s monitoring processes,
policies, and procedures.
The motion passed by unanimous voice vote.

None.

Adjourn
Motion: Ms. Vollen-Katz moved to adjourn the meeting. Ms. Kramer seconded the
motion and the motion passed by unanimous voice vote. The meeting was adjourned at

RECOMMENDED DESIGNATIONS
At its August 18, 2017, and September 16, 2017, meetings, the Budget Committee
designated funding to four jurisdictions selected through the competitive Partnerships and
Strategies to Reduce Violent Crime Request for Proposals. The Year One designations
supported research-informed planning to identify the drivers of violent crime in each
jurisdiction through the formation of local multi-disciplinary teams (MDTs) and the use
of community surveys, the Scanning, Analysis, Response and Assessment (SARA)
process, and other analytical tools.
Staff is recommending the following designations to these jurisdictions to complete these
planning initiatives and begin implementation of focused deterrence strategies that
closely target those offenders at highest risk of reoffending, offering social supports and

To reduce group-related violent crime through strengthened governmental collaboration and increased trust
between law enforcement and the communities they serve.
Priorities:
This program incorporates many of the Authority’s Guiding Principles, including Legitimacy, Strengthening
Communities, Prevention, Research Informed and Collaboration principles. For example, the jurisdiction will
be strengthening trust with the communities they serve (legitimacy); engaging community members in several
ways (strengthening communities); identifying and focusing on the few individuals responsible for most violent
crime and notifying these individuals of the consequences of future criminal activity (prevention); utilization of
the Scanning, Analysis, Response and Assessment (SARA) model ensures that crime data and community input
(research informed); and finally, all of the grant activities require a high degree of intra and interagency
partnership (collaboration).

The three-track Law Enforcement Response to Narcotics NOFO was issued in late March and
the funded programs commenced on schedule on October 1, 2017. The next NOFO to be issued
will be for court programs. Staff is requesting that $1.35 million in available JAG funds from the
FFY14, FFY15, and FFY16 awards is set aside to issue a NOFO in the first quarter of 2018 that
will solicit applications in three funding areas. This three-pronged strategy is designed to offer
mid-system agencies resources for planning, operations, and implementation of new plan-based
programming. The following chart indicates how the funds will be earmarked by funding

meeting. Staff requests permission to shift unused earmarked funds between categories to
maximize the use of funds to support as many successful applications as possible.
1. Operational Effectiveness
Budget reductions and rising personnel costs have left many agencies across the state without the
resources necessary to adequately staff critical criminal justice operations. The funding
opportunity will earmark $600,000 for grants supporting the operational effectiveness of
prosecution and public defense functions.
Both local and state agencies that are current JAG recipients will be eligible to apply under this
funding category. Applicants will be required to demonstrate effectiveness of and the ongoing
need for their program. Funding minimum and maximum values will be based on the population
served according to the following standards:
Population of Area Served
1 - 499,999
500,000 - 1,499,999
1,500,000 - 4,999,999
5,000,000 +

Minimum Award
$40,000

Maximum Award
$75,000
$125,000
$175,000
$225,000

2. Planning
Research supports the value of planning among local criminal justice stakeholders to better
coordinate and implement evidence-based criminal justice interventions. Whether aiming to
provide cost-effective alternatives to incarceration, target recidivism, or otherwise improve
criminal justice practices, local actors are often the best positioned to address local criminal
justice problems in a systematic fashion.1
ICJIA has fostered development of local planning processes that use research to maximize the
effectiveness of local crime reduction efforts through a number of funding streams, including the
JAG Partnerships and Strategies to Reduce Violence Crime programs, Adult Redeploy Illinois,
and the County Coordinating Councils technical assistance initiative. The proposed NOFO will
earmark $250,000 for grants ranging from $25,000 to $50,000 to support cooperative local
planning processes to identify the drivers of local crime, and the programs to address the
identified problems. The NOFO will specify required planning activities and participation, and
will include resources such as planning models, plan templates, and suggested planning tools
such as the Scanning, Analysis, Response, and Assessment (SARA) process. Applicants will be
required to demonstrate the jurisdiction’s readiness to undertake required activities.

3. Plan-based Implementation Projects -- Series 1
Research and experience indicates that programs developed through a coordinated planning
process have a better chance at achieving long-term sustainability and expansion because
program planning and development in that manner involves a wider-range of criminal justice
stakeholders.2 The planning process may involve activities including, but not limited to, data
analysis and collection, assessment of services offered, and developing pilot programs.
$500,000 will be earmarked to support the implementation of prosecution and public defense
projects identified through a local planning process as addressing local criminal justice issues.
Applicants will be required to describe the planning process as well as the findings and data that
demonstrate the need for the requested program funding. Awards will range from a minimum of
$25,000 to a maximum of $250,000. In order to foster statewide access to implementation
funding, the highest scoring application in each of five regions of the state will be funded. Any
remaining funds will be recommended to support the next highest scoring applications.
JAG NOFO Timeline
As detailed below, staff anticipate posting a NOFO for corrections-based programs third quarter
of 2018. In addition, staff anticipate requesting a set aside for a second implementation NOFO in
the third quarter of 2019 that will be open to law enforcement, prosecution, defense, and

RE:

FFY17 National Forensic Sciences Improvement Act Plan
Introduction

On September 29, 2017, the ICJIA received the FFY17 National Forensic Sciences
Improvement Act (NFSIA) award to Illinois in the amount of $307,162. Staff requests
permission to make designations at this time. Once administrative costs are removed,
$284,492 is available for programming.
Recommended Designations
NFSIA funds are used improve the quality and timeliness of forensic science and medical
examiner/coroner’s office services, including services provided by laboratories operated
by the State and/or units of local government. Among other things, funds may be used to
eliminate backlogs in the analysis of general forensic evidence or to train and employ
forensic laboratory personnel and medicolegal death investigators to eliminate such
backlogs.
NFSIA funds may only be used by a forensic science laboratory system, medical
examiner’s office, or coroner’s office that uses generally accepted laboratory practices
and procedures established by accrediting organizations or appropriate certifying bodies
and has received accreditation.
Staff proposes using FFY17 NFSIA funding to improve the quality and timeliness of
forensic science at the Cook County Medical Examiner’s Office and nine crime labs
across Illinois. These improvements will be made through agreements with the DuPage
County Crime Lab, the Northeastern Illinois Regional Crime Lab, the Office of the Cook
County Medical Examiner, and the Illinois State Police.

requirement

Agency Budget:

$14,195,795 (2017)

Request Type:

ICJIA Initiative

Program Description
The Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) Upgrade Program of the Cook County Medical
Examiner’s Office (CCMEO) will involve contractual work with an outside vendor to initiate alterations to the
current digital case management system to enhance the real-time population of data, streamline data entry with
minimal correction, and expedite the uploading of documents and reports. New vital case information will be
added to the digital files and upgrades will hasten the retrieval of data in the system that is currently difficult to
extract from case files. LIMS upgrades also will integrate the CCMEO’s digital system with outside systems,
including the outsource toxicology laboratory and the Cook County website, which will promote information
availability between systems and users.
Program Activities
The existing CCMEO’s LIMS was installed in 2014 and requires upgrades since deficiencies within the system
have been identified. Upon receipt of grant funds, a vendor will be notified and implementation strategies will
be discussed regarding upgrading the system. An upgraded LIMS will enhance data entry/retrieval from the
system and will enable LIMS to interface with other outside digital systems that operate in conjunction with the
CCMEO, such as the outsource toxicology laboratory and the Cook County website. An upgraded LIMS will
enable toxicology reports to be uploaded into the digital case files in a timely fashion and the community will
be able to view information relevant to their concerns on the Cook County website.

Program Description
The Paul Coverdell National Forensic Sciences Improvement Act program provides funding to improve the
quality and timeliness of forensic science services. This will be achieved through support of accreditation fees
and purchase of proficiency tests. Purchases of equipment and supplies will support the laboratory’s continued
commitment to quality and improving capacity enhancement. Funds will be used to send staff members to two
separate training events. This will assist staff members in performing their duties and facilitate transfer of
current and applicable information in the industry back to staff in our laboratory.
Program Activities
The funding will support maintaining laboratory accreditation and ensuring quality of testing through
proficiency testing at the DuPage County Crime Lab. Purchase of equipment will enable increasing safety and
quality measures available for staff working with suspected synthetic opioid submissions. Funding will also
support continuing education of both technical and administrative matters and will enable the laboratory to
address emerging issues for forensic science service providers. The program will enable the purchase of
equipment to increase throughput of samples in drug chemistry.
Goals
The laboratory will purchase a self-contained chemical hood and table that will increase safety and quality
measures for staff by providing a dedicated and enclosed space for the examination of evidence suspected to
contain synthetic opioid submissions (e.g. fentanyl, fentanyl-derivatives, carfentanil) that pose a significant
health risk to the analyst. The laboratory will purchase a 150 sample capacity auto-sampler tray for one GC/MS
dedicated to drug analysis, this tray will replace a tray with a current capacity for 16 samples thus increasing
higher throughput of samples outside of working hours. The laboratory will purchase proficiency tests to enable
demonstration of continued staff competency and will pay for continuing accreditation fees. Additionally,
funding will maintain and improve quality by providing continuing education to four members of staff.

BUDGET COMMITTEE GRANT RECOMMENDATION REPORT
Program Name:

Illinois State Police DiscovIR Purchase

Funding Source:

FFY17 National Forensic Science Improvement Act: $199,145.00; No match
requirement

Agency Budget:

Illinois State Police overall budget $573,237,000. (Forensic Sciences Command has
not had a budget since June 2015.)

Request Type:

Formula grant

Program Description
This grant will allow an Illinois State Police purchase of a DiscovIR system. This is a new technology that has
the ability to concentrate and separate a drug from its components using a gas chromatograph and then
determines structural information using infrared spectrometry. This instrument will allow the drug chemistry
section to detect low level drugs, drug isomers, designer drugs, and drugs that are mixed with substances that
interfere with the identification of drugs in criminal cases.
Program Activities
Illinois State Police wishes to purchase a gas chromatograph with a DiscovIR attachment. The DiscovIR-GC
enables the coupling of gas chromatography to infrared spectroscopy (IR) for the separation and identification
of low concentrations of molecules including controlled substances and hazardous materials. The instrument
uses direct deposition /solid phase IR technology to allow detection of substances such as synthetic
cannabinoids in the parts-per-billion range. This instrument is a new technology to Illinois State Police and is
emerging forensic science technology designed to improve the quality of the analysis provided to law
enforcement agencies.
Goals
This funding will increase ISP’s ability to identify designer drugs or trace levels of drugs. This will be achieved
by the purchase of a DiscovIR system from this grant. Once validated, the DiscovIR will be a tool in the
identification of synthetic cannabinoids, designer drugs, and trace substances found at crime scenes, such as
illegal methamphetamine laboratories.
Priorities
The National Forensic Sciences Improvement Act authorizes funding to improve the quality, timeliness, and
credibility of forensic science services for criminal justice purposes. The DiscovIR system will directly improve
the quality of the results being provided in difficult analyses and improve the credibility of reports being issued
on designer and synthetic drugs. ISP does not have this system so its addition will enhance results being

provided to the criminal justice system. This meets ICJIA’s commitment to making advances in the criminal
justice system. This will aid in the investigative information offered to law enforcement agencies.
Funding Prospectus
The Illinois State Police (ISP) does not intend to use this funding past 1 year. This is a single purchase where
the approval process has already started. Because ISP approvals are lengthy to purchase major equipment,
anticipated purchases from grants are started at the time the grant application is submitted. This allows the ISP
process to be completed without jeopardizing the timeline of the grant. If the grant is not funded, ISP can stop
the approval process without issue.  
Past Performance
For the FFY16 NFSIA, ISP was able to place orders for all items listed on the grant within the first two months
of receiving the grant. Once all goals were completed for the 2016 NFSIA grant, ISP determined there was
$7,869 remaining in grant funds. In July, 2017 a request to revise the budget was done to replace two broken
balances and a broken camera lens.
There have been no reporting or performance issues with this grantee.

Program Description
Hektoen Institute oversees the Healing Hurt People-Chicago (HHP-C), a hospital-based violence intervention
program (HBVIP) serving patients under 19 (and seeking to expand to serve young adults ages 19-30) with
community violence-related injuries at the Stroger Hospital (Stroger) Cook County Trauma Unit (CCTU) and
the University of Chicago Medicine (UCM) Comer Children’s Hospital (Comer). CCTU and UCM serve the
South and West Sides of the city, racially and economically segregated areas disproportionately impacted by
gun violence. The neighborhoods served by CCTU and UCM are home to a drastically underserved population
facing high rates of poverty. Due to the prevalence of violent crime, the day-to-day lives of many residents of
these areas are shaped by community violence.
Program Activities
HHP-C core direct services are delivered by trauma intervention specialists (TIS) who begin their work with
patients as early as possible after identification, ideally in the hospital or just after discharge. HHP-C team
members and other hospital staff monitor incoming traumas at CCTU and Comer to identify patients with
violent injuries. HHP-C staff conduct outreach activities to violently injured youth and their families in the
aftermath of violent injury, often as they are being treated in one of the trauma centers. HHP-C provides crisis
intervention, emotional and spiritual support, psychoeducation about trauma, tools for coping with trauma
reactions, safety and needs assessments, and practical assistance such as crime victim compensation
information. For patients and families who elect to participate in the program following hospital discharge, TIS
begin to identify initial goals for their work together through in-depth psychosocial assessments of: family
structure, work/education history, ACEs, substance use, safety, criminal justice involvement, PTSD and
depression. Intensive case management (ICM) is provided, offering long-term, high-intensity support in the
client’s environment, working toward mutually agreed upon goals and promoting trauma recovery. ICM
includes advocacy, mentoring, information/referral to needed services, and ongoing emotional support within
the context of a therapeutic model of care designed to address the complexities of past and ongoing trauma
exposure.
Goals
The proposed plan includes expanding upon HHP-C’s current focus serving violently injured youth ages 18 and
younger to serve young adults ages 19-30. Services to young adults will be implemented initially at CCTU, with
a planned expansion to the Adult Level 1 Trauma Center at UCM in the Spring of 2018.
