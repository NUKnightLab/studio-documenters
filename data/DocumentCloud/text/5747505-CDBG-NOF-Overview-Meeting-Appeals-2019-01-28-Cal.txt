Submitting report relative to 50% Parking Fine Discount for Detroit Residents. (The City
of Detroit is authorized by state law to regulate parking within City limits. Equal
protection challenges to an ordinance that provides 50% fine reduction to residents
would be decided by use of “rational basis” test, and the ordinance’s purpose of
assisting Detroiters of limited means and providing better access to City services on
metered streets (like City offices located downtown) may be adequate to provide a
rational basis for disparate treatment. However, the ordinance may have a difficult
time with a challenge under the Privileges and Immunities analysis. There, a 50%
discount may seem too great, as demonstrated in case law, and a lesser amount may
be easier to defend. In order to avoid being such an outlier, Detroit’s interests in this
may be better served with a 25% discount; this could be closer to the 20% discount
offered in the City of Miami.) (REFERRED TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND

Submitting report relative to Court of Appeals upholds DWSD Drainage Charge. (As

has faced a series of class action lawsuits challenging its charges for treating drainage
of rainwater runoff and human waste in “combined sewer overflow” (CSO) events
during heavy rain storms. DWSD’s new drainage charges went into effect in October
2016. On November 6, 2018, the Michigan Court of Appeals upheld DWSD’s drainage
charge in a detailed, unanimous 23-page written opinion resolving two such
consolidated claims. Binns, et al v City of Detroit, No. 337609, and Detroit Alliance
