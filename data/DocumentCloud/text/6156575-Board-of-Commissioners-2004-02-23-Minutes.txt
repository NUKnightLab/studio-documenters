 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 23, 2004

February 20, 2004
The Honorable President and Members of the
Cook County Board of Commissioners
Ladies and Gentlemen:
The delay in the passage of the FY2004 budget to well into the first quarter of the current
fiscal year, has provided us the opportunity to refine our Estimates of Revenues and
Available Resources for Fiscal Year 2004, including revised estimates of the financial
condition of the several funds of Cook County at the close of Fiscal Year 2003.
Specifically, we are decreasing the FY2004 revenue estimates, originally presented on
November 8, 2003, by $5,488,411 as follows:
Cigarette Tax - increasing the revenue estimate $32,375,000 to $69,375,000 to reflect the
proposed increase in cigarette taxes from 18 cents per pack to $1.00 per pack. (See page
51 of the Revenue Estimate book).
Treasurer Indemnity Fund Escheatment - increasing the revenue estimate $6,000,000 to
$48,575,000 to reflect a change in estimate by the Treasurer. (See page 54 of the Revenue
Estimate book).
Unknown Heirs Legal Settlement- increasing the revenue estimate $14,136,589 to reflect
the use of these one-time revenues to close the budget deficit. (See page 58 of the
Revenue Estimate book).
Personal Property Lease Transaction Tax - decreasing the revenue estimate $47,000,000
to $0, reflecting the withdrawal of this proposed tax. (See page 51 of the Revenue
Estimate book).
County Sales Tax - decreasing the revenue estimate $11 ,000,000 to $273,000,000
reflecting the withdrawal of the proposed 0.25% tax increase to 1.0%. The tax on general
merchandise will presently remain at 3/%. (See page 68 of the Revenue Estimate book).
With passage of the final budget and closing of our books for FY2003, we will report to
this Honorable Body, the revised and final figures.
If you have any questions, we are, as always, pleased to respond.
Sincerely,
THOMAS J. GLASER
Chief Financial Officer

JOHN F. CHAMBERS

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 23, 2004

Commissioner Quigley asked Barbara Bruno, Director of Revenue, for an estimate of the current revenue
being generated by cigarette tax.
Ms. Bruno responded that currently the tax is 18 cents per pack; it is estimated that this tax will generate
$3 7 million in 2004.
Commissioner Quigley asked for a figure for 2003.
Ms. Bruno responded that approximately $39 million was generated that year.
Commissioner Quigley asked Ms. Bruno to characterize the cigarette revenue trend over the past five
years.
Ms. Bruno responded that revenue appears to have decreased at the rate of7% per year.
Commissioner Quigley asked Ms. Bruno for a reason for this decline.
Ms. Bruno responded that she could not pinpoint causation; there are no available studies.
Commissioner Quigley asked Ms. Bruno to estimate how much revenue will be generated by the
proposed tax increase.
Ms. Bruno responded that with an effective date of April 1, $32.3 million would be generated, and with
an effective date of March I, $37 million would be generated. This would bring the total tax revenue to
$69 million and $74 million respectively.
Commissioner Quigley asked Ms. Bruno for the basis of her estimates.
Ms. Bruno noted the following: the University of Illinois study; the experience of New York City, which
increased its tax from 8 cents to $1.50 in 2002; the experience of Illinois, which raised its tax from 48
cents to 98 cents; Wisconsin's increase; and Cook County's 1997 increase which raised its tax from 10
cents to 18 cents (an 80% increase). Ms. Bruno also noted that another factor considered was whether
Illinois might raise its tax on July 1st.
Commissioner Quigley asked by what percentage sales would decrease as a result of Cook County's
proposed tax increase.
Ms. Bruno replied that sales would decrease by 59 percent. She noted that New York City's revenue
dropped 50 percent as a result of a dollar increase in tax; revenue increased from $158 million to $273
million. Ms. Bruno noted that approximately 46 percent of this revenue was apportioned to the state of
New York.
Commissioner Quigley inquired of Tom Glazer, Chief Financial Officer, whether the budget shortfall
would compute to approximately $26 million if the lease tax and sales tax were not passed and the
cigarette tax were passed.
Mr. Glazer responded in the affirmative.
Commissioner Goslin asked Ms. Bruno whether initial projections for cigarette tax revenue were in the
$40 million range.

142

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 23, 2004

Ms. Bruno noted that there have been approximately 50 revisions of the tax revenue projection.
Commissioner Maldonado noted that the difference is accounted for by the different proposed inception
dates of the tax.
Commissioner Goslin asked Ms. Bruno's opinion on the idea that sin tax item consumption historically is
affected by too numerous and disparate variables to be a reliable revenue source.
Ms. Bruno stated that there is a projected 7-10 percent decrease per year in cigarette consumption. This
decrease takes into account all the disparate factors.
Commissioner Goslin inquired whether the curve is going down.
Ms. Bruno replied in the affirmative. Regarding other states, she noted that the large cigarette tax
increases are so new that there has not been an opportunity to significantly chart consumption trends.
Commissioner Goslin inquired whether the 7-10 percent yearly decline is due to health concern and
economics.
Ms. Bruno replied in the affirmative, adding that people have become more sophisticated in their
purchasing, utilizing the computer. She noted that everyone in the county is within 30 minutes of another
county where they can purchase cigarettes with lower taxes.
Chairman Daley clarified that the $46 million dollar figure discussed earlier correlates to a January !st
start date for the cigarette tax increase.
Ms. Bruno responded that a January I st start date for the cigarette tax would yield $42.6 million for 2004.
Commissioner Sims asked Ms. Bruno whether additional auditors would be hired were the increased tax
to go into effect, and whether these additional auditors are necessary to the fulfillment of revenue
projection.
Ms. Bruno replied in the affirmative, noting that auditors would be sent to stores the day the tax increase
takes effect to inventory cigarettes.
Commissioner Steele asked whether Ms. Bruno's department would have the necessary number of
auditors to collect the cigarette taxes under the proposed tax increase.
Ms. Bruno responded in the affirmative.
Mr. Glazer stated that Ms. Bruno's department would work with staff from the Comptroller's Office, the
County Auditor's Office, the Budget Department and the Revenue Department to do sufficient auditing in
the days after the cigarette tax passed in order to maximize revenue collection.
Ms. Bruno noted that this was the arrangement for collection of the 1997 cigarette tax increase collection.
Commissioner Steele asked bow this personnel loan would impact the loaning departments and offices.
Mr. Glazer noted that the loan would be for only a week duration and that therefore the impact would not
be significant.

143

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 23, 2004

Commissioner Steele asked the hiring status regarding the open auditing positions the Revenue
Department.
Mr. Glazer stated that it is his expectation that these positions will be filled.
Ms. Bruno noted that many top auditors were lost to early retirement.
President Stroger clarified that there has been a hiring freeze.
Commissioner Maldonado asked whether, despite the projected 7% per year decrease in consumption of
cigarettes, a revenue increase of approximately $33 million would still be realized as a result of the
proposed increased tax with a start date of April 1st.
Ms. Bruno replied in the affirmative.
Commissioner Collins asked whether Ms. Bruno had examined how New York City's increased cigarette
tax impacted the revenue of sales tax from collateral items that were purchased across the city line.
Ms. Bruno replied she would inquire whether New York City had conducted any relevant study.
Commissioner Collins emphasized that other sales tax revenue would be negatively impacted were the
cigarette tax increase passed.
Ms. Bruno replied that in 1997 when diesel fuel tax was raised, an analogous assertion was made that
cigarette sales and therefore cigarette sales tax revenue would go down as purchasers crossed the border,
but, in actuality, no negative impact was found.
Commissioner Hansen responded that as a result of the 1997 diesel fuel tax increase, a number of south
suburban truck stops closed, and, as a result, sales tax revenue was affected.
Commissioner Sims replied that, to her knowledge, the one truck stop that closed had been scheduled for
closing, and it was coincidental to the diesel fuel tax increase.
Commissioner Hansen stated that there was public testimony to the contrary.
Commissioner Claypool stated that, if the proposed sales tax increase were levied, the decline in sales of
cigarettes would negatively impact city and state revenue. Further, if these governmental bodies were to
raise cigarette taxes to counteract declining sales, county sales of cigarettes would decline further. He
further stated that the proposed tax increase would eliminate entry-level jobs.
Commissioner Hansen stated that he knows of no statistics that correlate cigarette sales to health benefits
to the community. He asserted that increasing the value of cigarettes by increasing their tax would
stimulate both the black market and turf war, and would induce related crimes.
Commissioner Suffredin introduced the following amendment, which would funnel revenue from the
proposed cigarette tax increase into a fund which would address heart and lung disease in the community.
