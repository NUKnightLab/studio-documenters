Action Items
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)
With regard to request number 8, Mr. Elwell provided additional information. He stated that it is important to note that
this represents a change in how things will be done. In the past, transportation services have been provided through a
broker process, which is the way the other managed care companies have been doing it. This proposed contract moves
the services into an arrangement in which a certain number of vehicles/drivers will be dedicated to CCHHS business.
In this case, CCHHS will pay them by the hour and they will be directly ordered out by CCHHS so this organization
can be guaranteed that its patients will be picked up, regardless of the neighborhood, and are delivered back to their
home. He noted that review by Contract Compliance is pending; an extra effort will be made to make sure that this
contract is not one that receives a Minority and Women-Owned Business Enterprise (M/WBE) goals waiver.
Chairman Estrada inquired whether this vendor is prepared to provide these services immediately or whether they will
need to ramp up to prepare. Mr. Elwell responded that the contract is set to begin on June 1 – he thinks the vendor will
have enough time to prepare, as they are doing work in a similar capacity for another organization. He will go back to
make sure this is the case.
Chairman Estrada inquired regarding the vendor’s areas of strength versus the other responders. Mr. Elwell responded
that he was not a part of the evaluating group, but he will get the answer and provide it to the Committee through the
Chair.
Director Richardson-Lowry inquired regarding the plan to evaluate the services rendered by this vendor. Mr. Elwell
responded that the administration is taking a much more active role. In the past, when staff went to the broker, the
broker was the dispatch. Staff will now have a major part in the dispatch and will be keeping metrics on appointments
kept and delays. Additionally, although CCHHS does not have contracts to provide transportation for members of
other plans, it is committed to ensuring that any patient of CCHHS can get home after their appointment, so CCHHS
assumes some risk in that aspect, as transportation services could be provided to a CCHHS patient insured under a
different plan that may not be reimbursed.
Director Richardson-Lowry requested that the Committee receive a periodic update on the subject, perhaps on the basis
of every six (6) months, as this is such an integral part of CCHHS and has been a challenge to date.
Chairman Estrada stated that it is critical to document the history of the effectiveness of this vendor’s service and
delivery to CCHHS, and review how they have met their M/WBE goals with previous contracts. He requested that Mr.
Elwell ensure that this happens, and requested that Mr. Elwell share the information with him, following his review.
Chairman Estrada asked Mr. Elwell to remind the Committee of the options available for CCHHS if the administration
is unsatisfied with the performance of any of these contracts. Mr. Elwell responded that most contracts can be
terminated for convenience by CCHHS with three (3) days notice; he added that a few contracts require thirty (30)
days notice of cancellation for convenience.
Director Richardson-Lowry, seconded by Chairman Estrada, moved the approval of
request numbers 1 through 19, as amended, subject to completion of review by
Contract Compliance, where appropriate.
THE MOTION CARRIED
UNANIMOUSLY.

Report from the Chief Financial Officer (Attachment #2)
 Report
 Metrics
 Financials through March 2017
Ekerete Akpan, Chief Financial Officer, presented the information contained in his report, which included
Financials through March 2017 and an update on the subject of overtime. The Committee reviewed and discussed
the information.
During the discussion of slide 3, the Committee discussed the 20.5% variance in external claims expense between
actual to budget. Mr. Ekerete pointed to slide 5, which reflected a month to month change that lessens the gap
between actual to budget for CountyCare’s net impact on CCHHS; he stated that this is not yet a trend, but is
something staff are working on. Some factors that could positively impact this include: improving the throughput
in the clinics; improving the ability to internally refer; and working with CCHHS specialists with the ability to take
on CountyCare patients. Of those three (3) factors, Chairman Estrada inquired as to which one (1) would make
that trend move up faster. Mr. Akpan responded that the answer would be specialty care referrals, as well as
internal use of specialty pharmacy.
In response to a question from Board Chairman Hammock regarding the overall deficit, Mr. Elwell stated that there
are a couple of other factors that impact this. Part of this issue is that CCHHS/CountyCare patients have become
more expensive in total; there is still the problem of referrals, internal versus external, but now it is exacerbated by
the fact that these patients are turning out to be sicker. Looking at CountyCare’s Affordable Care Act (ACA)
population, last year, compared to the other health plans, the State found that those patients were almost 15%
sicker than what the other plans were experiencing. With regard to pharmacy, that is a pricing issue - pricing on
pharmaceuticals has taken off again, so even though CCHHS has 340b status and gets the best price possible, the
prices are now in a very sharp upturn.
Mr. Elwell provided additional information on how the State measures the sickness of patients. The State looks at
what types of pharmaceuticals the patient is prescribed and the patient’s diagnosis. Their actuaries have found that
if a person is using these pharmaceuticals, they are a “sicker” person; this is not based on the price of the
pharmaceuticals, but is based on certain types of pharmaceuticals. Board Chairman Hammock inquired whether
CCHHS’ cost accounting system is getting better in terms of calculating the cost to provide services per patient
versus income/reimbursement per patient. Mr. Akpan responded that CCHHS has some ways to go before that
level of granularity can be reached. He thinks that the new financial system and building up of the internal
monitoring system will help. Mr. Elwell stated that this information is available on CountyCare members, because
actuaries are employed and data is required to be tracked; a deeper dive on that information can be provided. It
was determined that a deep dive on that subject will be provided in June.
