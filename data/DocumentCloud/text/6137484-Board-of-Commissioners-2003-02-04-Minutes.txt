CONTRACT
Transmitting a Communication from
JOHN H. STROGER, JR., President, Cook County Board of Commissioners
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into contracts with Eugene Barnes, Chicago,
1llinois, and Stephen S. Morrill, Chicago, Illinois, whose names I am submitting for consideration as
County Lobbyists. Mr. Barnes and Mr. Morrill will serve for a period of one year beginning December 1,

Account)] . Contract period: December 1, 2002 through November 30, 2003.

PROPOSED ORDINANCE
Transmitting a Communicated, dated January 30, 2003 from
JOHN H. STROGER, JR., President, Cook County Board of Commissioners
I am transmitting for your consideration an Ordinance authorizing the execution of a fixed-to-floating
interest rate swap agreement between the County of Cook and Lehman Brothers Special Financing, Inc.
on $230,540,000 of the County's Series l 999A General Obligation Capital Improvement Bonds. Despite
the historically low interest rate environment, we are unable to undertake a refunding that meets our
hurdle of a 3% net present value savings. A fixed-to-floating interest rate swap offers the County an
opportunity to achieve interest cost savings by converting the fixed interest payment of 5% on the
County's Series 1999A Bonds to a floating rate based on the Bond Market Association Municipal Swap
Index (BMA), which has averaged 3.48% since 1989.
I ask that this Ordinance be referred to the Finance Committee for further discussion.
Submitting a Proposed Ordinance sponsored by
JOHN H. STROGER, JR., President, Cook County Board of Commissioners

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 4, 2003

Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Finance Tax Delinquency Subcommittee of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County met
pursuant to notice on Monday, February 3, 2003 at the hour of 11 :00 AM. in the Board Room, Room
569, County Building, 118 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois.
Your Subcommittee has considered the following items and upon adoption of this report, the
recommendations are as follows:
257220

VILLAGE OF ROBBINS (NO CASH BID REQUEST). Transmitting a Communication,
dated January 22, 2003 from Deborah Sims, Chairman, Finance Tax Delinquency
Subcommittee, submitting a request from Judd M. Harris, Esq., Judd M. Harris & Associates,
Law Office, Attorney:
The Village of Robbins is requesting tax certificates from the No Cash Bid Program for the
tax delinquent properties in the submitted list. The Village of Robbins hereby requests the
Cook County Department of Planning, Office of Economic Development, to bid, on behalf of
the Village of Robbins, on the tax delinquent properties. The intended use of the parcels is
redevelopment. Village of Robbins ordinance number is 5-28-02 states the acquisition and
redevelopment of these tax delinquent properties is in the best interest of the Village of
Robbins. A certified Resolution formally requesting the Village of Robbins to participate in
the program has been submitted along with a current title search of the parcels, a Sidwell map
of the area, and photographs of the properties. The benefit of obtaining these parcels and
restoring their ability to contribute to the tax base of the community adds both fiscal and
social advantages for the Village of Robbins. The Village of Robbins has retained Judd M.
Harris, Esq. to file the petitions for tax deeds for the parcels.
PROPERTY INDEX NUMBERS
A list of tax delinquent properties has been submitted as Exhibit " A".

Chairman Sims gave a brief background regarding the request and stated that the request was made during
the prior administration and was received and filed at the end of the term. The subcommittee is now
bringing them forward because there are some parcels that the subcommittee can move forward on today.
She said previously there were 548 parcels. However, on Friday it became apparent that the
subcommittee would only be able to move on 86 parcels. The village is withdrawing 16 parcels, and one
parcel is ineligible according to Ms. Berman, thus there are 86 parcels for approval by the subcommittee
today.
Commissioner Butler asked whether all 86 parcels are in the package before the subcommittee.
Chainnan Sims replied that yes, they are.
Vice-Chaimrnn Goslin inquired whether the Village had signed off on the parcels.
Chainnan Sims replied yes.
Vice-Chairman Goslin inquired whether there are 16 parcels that the village did not sign off on.
Troy Deckert responded that the village is withdrawing the 16 PINS. When the original 500 were drawn
up a long time ago, the land was vacant. The village has since built a senior citizens center, so they are
withdrawing the corresponding PINS. The 16 withdrawn PINS were left in by a clerical mistake. The
county will be acting on the remainder of the 500, but to process such a large number would be too
cumbersome.

602

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 4, 2003

Vice-Chairman Goslin inquired whether the village has a plan for development of the remainder of the
PINS.
Mr. Deckert responded that yes, the village has a plan for residential development of these 86 parcels,
although they haven' t picked a developer yet or made any redevelopment commitments. There have been
three single-family homes sold, and the village thinks that bodes well.
Fredda Berman of the County C lerk's Office noted that 28-01-106-001 is not eligible for purchase overthe-counter because there is only one year of delinquent, forfeited taxes. There are other delinquencies,
but they are subsequent to that year and they are not forfeited. This parcel could be purchased at a later
date at the Scavenger Sale.
Judd Harri s, attorney for the Village of Robbins, stated that it is the Village's understanding that they
submitted I 03 parcels to be acted on, as the original number- 548--is too cumbersome a number to act on
all at once. He stated that it is his understanding that the County Board will act on the 86 parcels, which
is I 03 minus the 16 that were withdrawn and the one ineligible.
Commissioner Peraica asked whether the regular procedure is being followed by the County Clerk, i.e.
the normal procedure that is required for acquisition of tax deeds.
Mr. Harris responded that the normal procedure to petition for tax deed will be followed when petitions
are filed for these parcels.
Commissioner Peraica asked whether the publication and notice requirements are being met.
Mr. Harris responded that this is the preliminary stage, the acquisition of the tax certificate, and that next
he has to file petitions for tax deeds according to the Illinois Property Tax Code and all the procedures
that are set forth in that law.
Chairman Sims requested that Mr. Harris also address the title search procedure.
Mr. Harris responded that the process was an abbreviated title search including ownership and the
existence or non-existence of any liens in favor of Cook County. He stated that he received a letter from
Jacqueline Harder on Friday that indicated that while the County Board would try to push these through
on an immediate basis, he would still have to provide completed title searches and some other
documentation that he expects to have in the next 14 days.
Vice-C hairman Goslin, seconded by Commissioner Butler, m oved the approval of Communication
No. 257220, including PIN Nos. 28-01-104-002, 28-01-107-024, 28-01-104-003, 28-01-107-029, 28-01104-004, 28-01-107-030, 28-01-104-005, 28-01-107-042, 28-01-104-006, 28-01-108-044, 28-01-104007, 28-01-108-048, 28-01-104-011, 28-01-109-001, 28-01-104-013, 28-01-109-002, 28-01-104-014, 2801-109-007, 28-01-104-016, 28-01-109-010, 28-01-104-108, 28-01-109-019, 28-01-104-019, 28-01-109020, 28-01-104-021, 28-01-109-021, 28-01-104-022, 28-01-109-022, 28-01-104-024, 28-01-109-027, 2801-104-029, 28-01-109-028, 28-01-1 05-023, 28-01-109-045, 28-01-105-024, 28-01-109-046, 28-01-105027, 28-01-110-006, 28-01-105-028, 28-01-110-016, 28-01-105-033, 28-01-110-019, 28-01-105-034, 2801-110-020, 28-01-105-035, 28-01-110-021, 28-01-105-037, 28-01-110-023, 28-01-105-042, 28-01-110025, 28-01-105-043, 28-01-110-026, 28-01-105-044, 28-01-110-027, 28-01-105-045, 28-01-110-030, 2801-105-046, 28-01-110-038, 28-01-105-047, 28-01-110-039, 28-01-105-048, 28-01-110-040, 28-01-106002, 28-01-300-001, 28-01-106-007, 28-01-300-008, 28-01-106-008, 28-01-300-010, 28-01-106-011, 2801-300-017, 28-01-106-013, 28-01-300-021, 28-01-106-015, 28-01-300-024, 28-01-106-016, 28-01-300026, 28-01-106-017, 28-01-300-027, 28-01-106-018, 28-01-300-028, 28-01-107-017, 28-01-300-029, 2801-107-022, 28-01-300-030, 28-01-107-023, 28-01-300-032.
