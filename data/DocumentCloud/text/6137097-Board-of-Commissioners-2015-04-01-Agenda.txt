PROPOSED RESOLUTION
URGING THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY
PERCENTAGE BASED BAIL BOND FEES

TO

PASS

LEGISLATION

TO

REFORM

WHEREAS, in 2011, 79% of Cook County defendants were either ordered to pay financial bond to
secure release pending trial or held without bond, 13% were ordered released subject to electronic
monitoring and only 8% were released pursuant to an I-bond; which allows defendants to be released
upon a signature, but still subjects them to payment of the full bond amount if they fail to make a
required court appearance; and
WHEREAS, by contrast, New York City releases approximately 70% of their felony pre-trial defendants
on personal recognizance, and Washington, D.C. releases over 80% of their felony pre-trial defendants
on personal recognizance, yet both cities have high court appearance rates and low re-arrest rates; and
WHEREAS, our over-reliance on a money-based bail system disproportionately impacts low-income
people and minorities, perpetuating the cycle of poverty and incarceration, evidenced by the fact that
about 86% of the Cook County jail population are African-American or Hispanic; and
WHEREAS, when properly administered, bail is designed to be a function of risk to society or flight
risk,not simply a means test of ability to pay; and
WHEREAS, the overreliance on monetary bail and the inability of many detainees to afford it are among
the primary drivers of the level and growth in our jail population; and
WHEREAS, monetary bail additionally means that those too poor to pay remain in jail regardless of
their risk level or presumed innocence; and
WHEREAS, a decades-old state law (725 ILCS 5/110-7) directs court clerks to retain 10% of posted bail
as ‘bail bond costs’ regardless of the size of the bond even though the costs of processing a bond by the
Clerk of the Court are the same regardless of the bond amount; and
WHEREAS, people with limited financial resources may not have the capacity to forfeit a 10% deposit
on their bond and the prospect of posting bond is made even more challenging given that even if they are
able to post bond, 10% of the money posted is kept by the Clerk of the Circuit Court, regardless of
whether they abide by the conditions of their bond, if they are found to be innocent of the charges against
them or even if the charges are dropped; and
WHEREAS, this percentage-based fee is inherently unfair and regressive. As a percentage of their
income, poor people who are arrested are paying more for these bond processing fees, in fact on any
given day, about 1/5 of the Cook County jail population are there because they were unable to post
$6,000 or less to bail out, resulting in higher than necessary daily jail populations at a significant cost to
the county, costs that can exceed the amount of the underlying bail; and

 Board of Commissioners

BOARD AGENDA

April 1, 2015

WHEREAS, in 2013, the Clerk of the Court for Cook County retained $5.6 million as ‘bail bond costs’
pursuant to 725 ILCS 5/110-7; and
WHEREAS, it is contrary to prudent public policy or the notion of an equitable criminal justice system
for units of government to use excessive ‘bail bond costs’ as a profit resource; and
WHEREAS, legislation was recently introduced in both the Illinois House of Representatives and
Illinois Senate which would amend 725 ILCS 5/110-7 by capping the antiquated percentage-based bond
processing fee collected by the Cook County Clerk of the Circuit Court at $100, an amount more than
sufficient to cover processing costs;
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners urges the
Illinois General Assembly to pass legislation amending 725 ILCS 5/110-7 to cap the fee collected on bail
bond deposits by the Clerk of the Circuit Court for Cook County, thereby reducing the already significant
and unnecessary financial burden on pre-trial detainees and their families, reducing average daily jail
population, as a necessary step towards reforming our criminal justice system; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a suitable copy of the Resolution be tendered to the Speaker of
the Illinois House of Representatives, the President of the Illinois Senate and to the Governor of Illinois.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
OPPOSING A PROPERTY TAX INCREASE IN THE FISCAL YEAR 2016 BUDGET
WHEREAS, Cook County is located in the northeastern section of the State of Illinois that contains
more than 800 local governmental units within its boundaries, it has a population of approximately 5.3
million people, it is the second most populous county in the nation and the 19th largest government in the
United States (2005 census statistics); and
WHEREAS, Cook County contains 135 municipalities in its region, the most well-known being The
City of Chicago, the City of Chicago and the suburban municipalities account for approximately 85% of
the County’s 946 square miles, while unincorporated areas make up the remaining 15%; and
WHEREAS, property taxes are paid in arrears and are due in two installments every year, and after
taking advantage of property tax exemptions, many longtime homeowners still face the threat of being
forced to sell their property due to the exponential cost of their property taxes; and
WHEREAS, despite Cook County holding the line on its property tax levy since 1994, taxpayers are
subject to increasing property tax bills as a result of the increase of tax rates by individual taxing
districts; and
WHEREAS, property taxes collected by all governments in Cook County increased from $7.89 billion
in 2000 to $11.69 billion in 2010 according to the Heartland Institute; and

Page 4 of 41

 Board of Commissioners

BOARD AGENDA

April 1, 2015

WHEREAS, according to Internal Revenue Service data from 1992 through 2010 Cook County lost a
net of nearly 276,000 taxpayers to neighboring counties, including DuPage, Will, Lake Kane, McHenry
and Lake County Indiana, raising property taxes will result in even more individuals and businesses
relocating to these neighboring counties; and
WHEREAS, our housing market is slowly recovering from the recession, but still lagging behind other
regions according to Zillow Inc., there are still lingering effects from foreclosures during the recession;
high property taxes can have a further negative effect on the housing market; and
WHEREAS, economies and governments can thrive from a broad tax base and lower taxes, raising
property taxes is a threat to an improving economy as it would restrict growth that has not been seen in
years; and
WHEREAS, while many families have not fully recovered from what is now referred to as the “Great
Recession” and there are still many people facing financial struggles, including senior citizens and
individuals on fixed incomes who cannot afford a property tax increase; and
WHEREAS, while Cook County has made many efforts to streamline County government, Cook County
residents still pay too much in taxes and fees; and
WHEREAS, businesses will continue to relocate to neighboring counties to avoid the high cost of doing
business in Cook County resulting in a loss of revenue and jobs; and
WHEREAS, while opposing a property tax increase, our opposition is not intended to extend to any
expiring TIF districts revenues and new construction revenues in Cook County.
NOW, THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that the members of the Board of Commissioners of Cook
County in an effort to support the citizens and businesses of the County shall oppose a property tax
increase and look for other methods to fill the budget shortfalls in the 2016 Cook County fiscal budget.

PROPOSED NO CASH BID REQUEST
Requestor: Troy Ishler, City Administrator, City of Oak Forest
Request: Approval of No Cash Bid Request
Location:

City of Oak Forest

Volume and Property Index Number:
030, 28-15-117-010-0000

Summary: The City of Oak Forest would like to express its interest in receiving a No Cash Bid for the
one (1) property/PIN below that houses an unoccupied commercial building on the property that has been
vacant for over 4 years. The City of Oak Forest has been working on various economic development
plans for the region where this parcel exists. By regaining economic development control of the area, the
City can begin to move these plans along to fruition. The primary land use for this property will be

commercial. Due to the lack of a third party requestor the City cannot provide a specific use or function,
but through the use of the City’s Comprehensive Land Use Plan and economic development planning the
city looks to reposition the property in the following manner: the City is working diligently to redevelop
and reinvigorate the Cicero Ave. corridor by investing in its streetscape and attain development control
on dilapidated multi-family/commercial buildings. One major issue along the commercial corridors of
Oak Forest is the smaller parcel commercial properties and lack of space for larger, more tax-producing
users. Oak Forest would like to retain control of this property as step1of the land consolidation with the
neighboring lots to create a larger more buildable lot in the future.
The City of Oak Forest will utilize its legal counsel to obtain the tax deed and bear all legal and other
costs associated with the acquisition of the parcel. If the City is awarded the subject property, the City
will provide an annual status report on the development of the property for five years or until
development is complete or conveyed for future development, whichever occurs last. The City of Oak
Forest will file for tax-exempt status for the subject properties for as long as the City is in ownership of
these properties.

Summary: The City of Oak Forest would like to express its interest in receiving a No Cash Bid for the 4
vacant properties/PINs below. The City of Oak Forest has been working on various economic
development plans for each region where these parcel exists. By regaining economic development
control of these areas, the City can begin to move these plans along to fruition. The following properties
are vacant land are requested by the City of Oak Forest for the Cook County No Cash Bid Program.
As the City of Oak Forest does not have a third party requestor, it cannot provide a specific land use;
however, through the use of the City’s Comprehensive Land Use Plan and economic development planning
the city plans to reposition the properties in the following manner:
The City of Oak Forest is the current and owner of 28-16-208-014-0000. The City seeks these properties
(28-16-208-015-0000, 28-16-208-016-0000) in order to consolidate all three parcels and create a new
commercial outlot on Cicero Avenue which will produce new tax increment in the City’s TIF district.
Through this development, the City plans to decrease the amount of ingress/egress driveways create a new
vehicle circulation pattern for nearby commercial entities that will result in better parking ratios, lot
circulation, and an increase in safer movements on and off Cicero Ave. The City projects this property
(28-27-203-003-0000) to be preserved as open space and possibly used as common detention area for the
future non-residential development of SE 167th Street & Cicero dependent on qualifying detention
standards. The City projects this property (28-27-203-012-0000) to be part of the land assembly required to

create a large scale development at SE 167th & Cicero Ave, as proposed by the Comprehensive land Use
Plan. The City seeks development control to ensure this property will be available as part of a future land
assembly.The City of Oak Forest will utilize its legal counsel to obtain the tax deeds and bear all legal and
other costs associated with the acquisition of the parcels. If the City is awarded the subject properties, the
City will provide an annual status report on the development of the properties for five years or until
development is complete or conveyed for future development, whichever occurs last. The City of Oak
Forest will file for tax-exempt status for the subject properties for as long as the City is in ownership of
these properties.

Summary: The Cook County Department of Environmental Control was awarded $1.23 Million over 2
½ years from the U.S. Department of Energy (USDOE) through the Solar Market Pathways SunShot
initiative. Community shared solar uses a solar-electric system that provides power and/or financial
benefits such as savings to multiple community members, expanding access to solar power to renters,
condo owners, those whose roofs are too shady, and those who cannot afford to install an entire roof full of
solar panels.
The SunShot initiative is intended to enable replicable multi-year strategies that spur significant solar
deployment, drive down solar soft costs, support local economic development efforts, and address the
potential challenges arising from increased solar penetration on the electrical grid.
Project Tasks:
1. Opportunity Assessment: Inventory the current community solar market in the county, and
identify the potential market by suitable available sites (supply) and customer base (demand).
This will inform selection of pilot projects and identification of stakeholders.
2. Stakeholder Outreach and Engagement: Facilitate stakeholder collaboration to identify,
discuss, and resolve community-shared solar challenges in Northeast Illinois.
3. Research Policy Issues and Market Barriers: Address the policy and market barriers that
impose challenges to shared solar success.
4. Design Pilot Demonstration Programs: Choose 5 - 7 pilot project sites based on what is
learned from tasks 1 - 3. Analyze the physical and economic potential of those pilots.
5. Benefits and Next Steps: Document and disseminate the pilot site analysis of costs and benefits
to local, state and regional stakeholders.
The USDOE grant that will fund this project was based on a proposal that included this work
being performed by Elevate Energy. This is a Sole Source Procurement pursuant to Section
34-139 of the Cook County Procurement Code.

Grant Amount: $83,616,000 (Includes the $13.9 million and $54.9 million, which were previously
approved by the Board of Commissioners in March and September of 2014.)

Fiscal Impact: N/A
Accounts: N/A
Concurrences:
The Budget Department has received all requisite documents and determined the fiscal impact on Cook
County, if any
Summary:
Transmitted herewith is a request for the approval to accept a U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD) grant of Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR)
funds in response to disasters occurring in 2013, authorized under the Disaster Relief Appropriations
Act, 2013. The purpose of the CDBG-DR program is to assist targeted areas that have been affected by a
natural disaster (in this case, severe storms and flooding during the period of 4/16/2013 to 5/5/2013). The
program will provide necessary expenses related to disaster relief, long-term recovery, restoration of
infrastructure and housing, and economic revitalization in the most impacted and distressed areas
resulting from a major disaster declared pursuant to the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and
Emergency Assistance Act of 1974 (Stafford Act).
Cook County was initially allocated $68.8 million via two awards, which were accepted by the Cook
County Board of Commissioners in March and September 2014 respectively. Subsequent to the initial
allocation, Cook County was awarded an additional $14,816,000, bringing the total grant amount to
$83,616,000.
In order to identify the most impacted and distressed areas by the 2013 declared disaster as well as to
identify potential projects, the Department of Planning and Development met with or consulted related
studies prepared by the Cook County Departments of Homeland Security and Emergency Management,
Environmental Control, and Transportation and Highways, the Cook County Forest Preserve District, the
Illinois and Federal Emergency Management Agencies (IEMA and FEMA, respectively), the
Metropolitan Water Reclamation District, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as well as municipal and
township leaders.
The Department of Planning and Development desires to fund projects that strategically assist with the
recovery efforts and support other investments which are occurring in the area. Cook County plans to
enter into CDBG-DR agreements with municipalities, townships, for-profit and/or non-profit entities to
implement CDBG-DR activities.
I respectfully request approval to accept this grant award and that the Bureau Chief of the Bureau of
Economic Development or their designee, is authorized to execute on behalf of the County of Cook, any
and all documents necessary to facilitate administration of the program approved here in, including but
not limited to the CDBG-DR grant agreement, subrecipient agreements or other appropriate agreements,
and any modifications thereto. The approval of this of the request by this Honorable Body will permit the
CDBG-DR program to proceed with implementation.

The Chief Procurement Officer concurs.
Summary: Cook County has two 8-year-old IBM iSeries computers (one for production and one for
testing) that support mission-critical financial, property, and criminal justice systems, and over 2,000
internal users. While many of these systems are being reengineered for other platforms (such as the ERP
software that will replace the County’s current JD Edwards One World system), the County anticipates
needing iSeries capabilities for another 3 to 5 years. However, the County faces mounting risks in the
next 3 to 5 years as the physical hardware and software become increasingly unsupportable.
Therefore, BOT, BOF and the Assessor respectfully request approval of this amendment to the County’s
current Acxiom contract, which will include hosting of the County’s iSeries servers at Acxiom, where
the County’s mainframe is currently hosted. The increase and extension will fund the iSeries hosting
through 2019, without adding time or money for mainframe hosting services. The migration will
immediately upgrade the resiliency and availability of the County’s mission-critical financial, property,
and criminal justice systems that run on the iSeries servers, including the County’s JD Edwards One
World financial system.
Through this amendment, BOT and its partners seek to mitigate several identified risks to these systems:
eight-year-old hardware, including disk drives and tape drives, are increasingly failing due to their age;
and the servers’ back-up tape drives are out of support and are no longer supported by the manufacturer,
making restoration from tape drive extremely difficult. Were an out-of-support disk and tape drive to fail,
the County could face catastrophic data loss. Through the contract amendment, Acxiom will provide a
hosting environment that eliminates or reduces these potential points of failure.
In establishing its strategy and negotiating the contract amendment, BOT has coordinated with and
briefed several key stakeholders, including the County’s Chief Information Security Officer, Assessor’s
and Chief Judge’s offices; and service levels have been negotiated in order to meet the needs of our
finance, criminal justice and property stakeholders.
