REPORT
Department: Office of the General Superintendent
Request: Receive and File
Report Title: Walking Green: Developing an Evidence-base for Nature Prescriptions in the Forest
Preserve District of Cook County
Page 8 of 32

 Journal of Proceedings
FPD Board of Commissioners

March 13, 2018

Report Period: July 2015 - January 2018
Summary: Dr. Teresa Horton, Department of Anthropology at Northwestern University, was the
principal investigator for the study “Walking Green: Developing an Evidence-base for Nature
Prescriptions.” The study was partially funded by the Forest Preserve District of Cook County (the
“Forest Preserves”) and compares the health effects of walking in the Forest Preserves property as
compared to walking on a suburban sidewalk.
The purpose of the study was to gather data essential for the development of nature prescriptions, which
can be recommended by doctors to patients to encourage them to get outdoors, connect to nature, enjoy,
and support the Forest Preserves. The study demonstrates that the benefits of exercising in nature exceed
those of an equivalent amount of exercise in other conditions, such as walking on a suburban sidewalk.
The study also shows that there are significant mental health benefits including improved mood, reduced
anxiety, and reductions in perceived stress that can be gained from taking a 50-minute walk on a Forest
Preserve trail.
This study advances the Forest Preserves’ Next Century Conservation Plan’s priority to provide programs
that emphasize health benefits and inspire the people of and visitors to Cook County to seek out the
Forest Preserves for discovery, renewal, and fun.
A motion was made by Commissioner Goslin, seconded by Commissioner Deer, to receive and filed

District(s): 9
Summary: The contract #74000002862 issued under specification #17-80-31 includes professional
services for Phase 1 Engineering Services to identify and complete preliminary design of an acceptable
solution over, under or across the Union Pacific Railroad for Forest Preserves’ Des Plaines River Trail
north of Golf Road. The railroad tracks create a significant interruption for trail users preventing
continuous use of the trail system and access to Forest Preserve holdings. The scope will include a
crossing at the existing location, as well as identifying alternative locations for the crossing.
The Forest Preserves received thirteen (13) proposals for the project. TERRA Engineering, Ltd. was
determined to have submitted the most responsive and responsible proposal, particularly related to their
relevant experience, project understanding, technical approach, innovative concepts, effective utilization
of subcontractors and capacity to do the work.
The Forest Preserves has been awarded a grant from the Cook County Department of Transportation and
Highways through the Invest in Cook program in the amount of $100,000.00 for engineering services.
The Invest in Cook program helps cover the cost of planning and feasibility studies, engineering
right-of-way acquisition, and construction associated with transportation improvements sponsored by
local and regional governments and private partners. To leverage $100,000.00 of Invest in Cook grant
funds the Forest Preserves has proposed to commit $50,000.00 in matching funds for engineering services
for the project.
