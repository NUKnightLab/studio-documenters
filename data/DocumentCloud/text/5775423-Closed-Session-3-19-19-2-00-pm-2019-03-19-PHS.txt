Contents

Emergency Action Plan
Severe Weather Policy
Public Awareness

Assessment of Course

Emergency Action Plan

An emergency situation may arise during the Detroit Cycling Championship event and this is an
outline covering how to manage those situations. The race-assigned phones/radios will be the
primary form of communication between race staff, course marshals, medicals staff, and

community officials (police and fire departments if present at the race location). Emergency
Action Plan Personnel - Detroit Cycling Championship

R M_first aid staff

Universal Ambulance on standby

Course Marshalls

Official Race Staff (including USA Cycling race officials)

Detroit Police and Fire Officers

Roles of the Emergency Staff Personnel:

first aid staff: Assess injury or illness of individual and treat the minor scrapes and
bruises that go along with bike racing (providing basic first aid, wound care, etc.), as well as
evaluating/handling any major injuries that might occur and determine if more medical care is
needed which may include contacting [Universal Ambulance] for medical transport.

Course Marshalls: Alert Chief Referee and medical staff of an injury/accident via the radio
communications and determine appropriate action with respect to ongoing race status.
Course Marshalls will also be assigned to intersections and course crossings for crowd control
and safety during the bike races (see diagram on last page for course marshal stations).

 

Official Race Staff: Help direct crowd control in the event of a significant emergency situation.

Basic guidelines for Emergency Team:

Immediate care of athlete: Most qualified individual on the scene should provide direct acute
care.

Life threatening: RIM first aid staff [and/or Universal Ambulance]: provides immediate
care i.e. CPR, spinal stabilization, control severe bleeding, etc.

Orthopedic: RIM first aid staff [and/or Universal Ambulance]: to assess severity of
injury and appropriate transport method i.e. ambulance, transport via
cart to first aid tent, athlete able to walk, etc.

General medical: First aid tent located near start/finish line (Beech St and 1St St)

EMT Activation: This should be done as soon as the situation is deemed life threatening in any
emergency situation. Either medical staff person or Race official should make the call to
Universal Ambulance and/or EMT. The person calling needs to remain calm and have the
following information:

0 Patients name, caller's name, phone location

2

- Severity of injuries, of people involved
- What care is being provided
- Instructions to reach the scene

The communication to EMT will be made by cellular phone or race radio. Once the call is
made either a medical staff person or race staff person needs to meet the emergency medical
staff at the designated location. Note: in no circumstances should EMT personnel or
ambulance enter onto the racecourse without first consulting with the USA Cycling Chief
Referee to make sure the bike race has been ?neutralized? stopped).

Emergency Communication Equipment:

The main form of communication will be race-assigned radios and cellular phones and at each
venue will be checked for level of reception/signal.

Emergency Equipment: Emergency equipment such as splints, slings, crutches, etc. will be
kept in the first aid tent located near start/finish line (Beech St and 1St St)

Spectators, Media, Family Members: Event staff will maintain spectators at a distance to
allow medical staff to provide care and emergency medical personnel access to the location.
Sports information/marketing personnel will direct media to an appropriate site until a
statement is available. Event officials will escort family members to a private area until
medical staff is able to communicate the plan of care and give information about the incident.

Overall: The importance of being properly prepared cannot be stressed enough to insure the
best possible care for a rider in the event of an emergency.

Severe Weather Policy
Lightening/ Tornado:

The Official Race Staff in consultation with the Police Department and/or Fire Department will
help to monitor weather conditions and weather alerts that may arise primarily through the
use of smart phone technology. The Official Race Staff will keep the Course Marshalls
informed of the weather conditions/alerts. The Official Race Staff in consultation with the
Police and/or Fire Department will make the determination as to the race being delayed,
postponed, etc.

In the event of a weather interruption, the Official Race Staff will work with the race
announcers and Course Marshals to notify riders and spectators of the situation.

DCC Staff, participants etc. will be directed into shelter in place for any adverse weather
conditions or civil unrest.

conditions:

I. A permit for rehabilitation work shall be applied for within te_n (10) business days from the date of the City Council
