after the opening thereof. If it is evident that only one qualified bid has been submitted with respect to a
particular contract, no bid envelope is opened and any sealed bid(s) shall be returned to the bidder(s) via

determine whether to re-issue the solicitation of competitive bids as a result. If it is determined that an
error was made in announcing the bid or there was a failure to read all bids into the record, the Purchasing

the need to reconvene the Bid Opening to correct the record. As soon as reasonably possible, the Bid

the Purchasing Agent prepares the pre-award bids report and posts said report on the County's web-site
and on the bulletin board outside the Purchasing Agent's Office. The time intervals required to evaluate
bids are not always predictable. Bidders are responsible for monitoring the web-site or, if they lack web
access, for calling the Office of the Purchasing Agent on Mondays after 12:00 noon at (312)603-5370 to
determine whether a recommendation for award will be posted during the upcoming week.

reason to believe that the bidder identified in the posted recommendation for award is not entitled to be
awarded the contract, or who has a complaint about the bid process, may submit a written bid protest, in
writing, directed to the Purchasing Agent. Such protest may be submitted at any time prior to the
announcement of the recommended bidder, but no later than three business days after the date upon which
the recommendation for award is posted on the County's web-site and on the Purchasing Agent's bulletin
board. The bid protest must state with specificity the basis upon which the bidder believes that the
recommendation for award is erroneous, or the basis upon which the bidder believes the bid procedure
was unfair, including a statement of how the alleged unfairness prejudiced the protesting bidder. A bidder
who could have submitted a request for exception, clarification or information prior to bid opening but
failed to do so shall not be entitled to protest a bid on the basis of insufficient information or clarity after
the bids have been opened.
(m)
Purchases and Contracts of $100,000.00 25,000.00 or more or contracts for professional
and managerial services of $25,000.00 5,000.00 or more; The Purchasing Agent shall decide all bid

reasoning for said decision shall be disseminated to the Board of Commissioners prior to final
recommendation for award.

negotiation of a contract with one or more proposers selected as the result of an
evaluation process which includes the simultaneous consideration of multiple evaluation
factors.

2)

Notification. In order to issue an RFP or RFQ, the Using Department or Elected Official
must notify the Purchasing Agent in writing that it intends to issue a RFP or RFQ.

or more witnesses after the designated date for submission. A list of firms or individuals
offering proposals or responding to RFQs shall be submitted to the Purchasing Agent
within 24 hours of RFP or RFQ opening. The contents of the RFP or RFQ shall not be
disclosed to competing offers during the process of negotiation. Any proposer that

13

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 4, 2010
cancels, withdraws or modifies its proposal after the proposal due date without County
approval may result in the proposer being deemed unqualified and may prohibit said
proposer from receiving a County contract for a period of one year. A record of proposals
shall be prepared and shall be open for public inspection after contract award.
6)

Evaluation. The Using Department or Elected Official shall identify the factors to be
used in evaluating proposals, which information shall be set forth in the RFP. These
factors include, but are not limited to, price, experience and qualifications of the
proposer, the quality and cost effectiveness of the proposal, and the demonstrated

proposers.

7)

Discussions. As provided in the RFP or RFQ, discussions may be conducted with
responsible proposers who submit proposals determined to have the greatest likelihood of
being selected for a contract for the purpose of clarifying and assuring full understanding
of and responsiveness to the County's requirements. Those proposers shall be accorded
fair and equal treatment with respect to any opportunity for discussion and revision of
proposals. Revisions to proposals may be permitted after submission for the purpose of
obtaining best and final proposals before a recommendation is made to the Board of
Commissioners. In conducting discussions there shall be no disclosure of any confidential
information derived from proposals submitted by competing proposers. If information is
disclosed to any proposer, it shall be provided to all competing proposers. Once a
proposer has been recommended to and approved by the Board of Commissioners, the
Using Department or Elected Official shall finalize the contract terms for the Board's
execution consideration.

8)

Recommendations. The Using Department or Elected Official shall recommend to the
Board of Commissioners that the County enter into a contract with the responsible
proposer whose proposal or qualifications is determined in writing by such Using
Department or Elected Official to be the most advantageous to the County, taking into
consideration price, qualifications and the evaluation factors set forth in the request for
proposals. The Using Department or Elected Official shall document the results of its
evaluation and the reasons for its recommendation to the Purchasing Agent. The Using
Department or Elected Official shall be responsible for requesting that the Board of
Commissioners authorize a contract with the recommended proposer. The authorization
of the Board of Commissioners to enter into a contract shall not result in a contract unless
and until the Board has authorized the execution of the final contract documents upon the
request of the Purchasing Agent. The Purchasing Agent's request to the Board for
contract execution shall be subject to the proposed contractor's compliance with all
applicable laws and County procedures and to the Purchasing Agent's review of the
subject contract.

Effective immediately, the Purchasing Agent shall provide to the Board of Commissioners a
report of all notifications made pursuant to subsection (2), within 72 hours of receiving such notice.

whether with respect to the classified services or otherwise, shall not be subject to the provisions of this
article, nor shall this article be applicable to the granting or issuance pursuant to powers conferred by

RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, the holiday of Cinco de Mayo commemorates the victory of the Mexican militia over the
French army at The Battle of Puebla, Mexico, 100 miles east of Mexico City, on the morning of May 5,
1862; and
WHEREAS, lead by Mexican General Ignacio Zaragoza Seguin, a small, poorly armed militia estimated
at 4,500 men demonstrated their courage and sacrifice for freedom by stopping and defeating a well
outfitted French army of 6,500 soldiers, which had known no defeat for almost 50 years, therefore
postponing the invasion of the country for a full year; and

national unity and pride; and
WHEREAS, according to a paper published by the UCLA Center for the Study of Latino Health and
Culture in 2007, about the origin of the observance of Cinco de Mayo in the United States, the modern
American focus on this holiday first started in California in 1863 in response to the resistance to French
rule in Mexico, and has since been celebrated continuously while virtually ignored in Mexico, where it is
celebrated mainly in the southern town of Puebla and a few larger cities, and has to this day not been
recognized as a federal holiday; and

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners, on behalf
of the more than five million residents of Cook County, does hereby join in the celebration of Cinco de

27

The Department of Highways submits for execution three (3) copies of a Highway Authority Agreement
along with a Supplemental Agreement with Edward Young Paik (owner of Smile Auto Sales) for
facilities at 2020 East Euclid Avenue, the intersection of Euclid Avenue (CH A59) at Des Plaines River
Road, in the Village of Mount Prospect. This two-agreement approach became necessary when the
Illinois Administrative Code was amended to provide that all future Tiered Approach to Corrective
Action Objectives Agreements be based upon a State-mandated form. The Supplemental Agreement
contains greater protections for Cook County than the state form and together they are considered as a
single “Agreement”.
The Agreement has been prepared in compliance with Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA)
directives toward a tiered approach in dealing with petroleum contamination to soils. For contaminate
concentrations which are of low levels, Tier 1 residential remediation, the IEPA allows for their
remaining in place subject to certain conditions which are, in part, that pumping of potable water in the
location be prohibited, that excavators in the location be informed of the proscribed status for material
handling and that any excavated material be properly disposed. The IEPA requirements also call for these
Agreements to, by reference, be recorded against the property.
The location listed as subject for Highway Authority Agreements is, in part, located along a County
highway and so being, the County has control of the right-of-way through the Highway Department
Permit Office. The County, by executing the Agreement, will agree to restrict the extraction of potable
water from this location, inform Permittees of the proscribed status of the referenced location and require
that Permittees properly dispose of excavated soil.
The Agreement further indemnifies and holds the County harmless from liabilities and damages arising
from the petroleum contamination; as well as makes provisions for reimbursement of expenses incurred
by the County should the Highway Department be required in the course of normal maintenance to
expose and dispose of contaminated soils.
The Agreement was prepared following a Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office prepared Standard
Agreement and has been examined and approved by this Department and the State's Attorney's Office. It
is respectfully requested that, should your Honorable Body concur in this recommendation, the resolution
be adopted and the Agreement executed and that an executed copy of the Agreement be returned to
Edward Young Paik for further processing and forwarding to the Illinois Environmental Protection
Agency.
RESOLVED by the members of The Board of Commissioners of Cook County, Illinois, on behalf of the
County of Cook, to authorize and direct its President to execute, by original signature or his authorized
signature stamp, three (3) copies of a HIGHWAY AUTHORITY AGREEMENT along with a
SUPPLEMENTAL AGREEMENT with Edward Young Paik (owner of Smile Auto Sales), attached
hereto and made part hereof, wherein, on highways under Cook County jurisdiction, adjacent to Edward
Young Paik owned facilities and subject to said Agreements for Tier 1 residential remediation objectives,
the County of Cook shall prohibit the extraction of potable water from its right-of-way and shall notify
Permittees of proscribed status and requirements at the following location as part of its Highway
Department Permit process.
RESOLVED that the following location is approved as being subject to HIGHWAY AUTHORITY
AGREEMENT along with a SUPPLEMENTAL AGREEMENT:

30, 2010.
