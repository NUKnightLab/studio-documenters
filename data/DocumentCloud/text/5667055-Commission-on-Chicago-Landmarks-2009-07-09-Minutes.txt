 PERMIT REVIEW COMMITTEE REPORT TO
COMMISSION ON CHICAGO LANDMARKS
July 9, 2009
The Permit Review Committee (PRC) met on June 4, at 1:15 p.m. The meeting was held at 33 N.
LaSalle Street, Room 1600.
Present:

Ben Weese
John Baird
Phyllis Ellin
Edward Torrez
Ernest Wong

Staff:

Brian Goeken, Deputy Commissioner, Historic Preservation Division, Department of
Zoning and Land Use Planning
Eleanor Gorski, Assistant Commissioner
Dijana Cuvalo
Beth Johnson
Cindy Roubik
Lawrence Shure

The following projects were reviewed by the PRC:
1.

Wood Block Alley (Between Astor St. and State Pkwy)
(Astor Street District – 43rd Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed replacement of severely deteriorated wood-block pavers with
replacement wood pavers cut from salvaged railroad ties

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. As proposed, the existing wood-block pavers will be salvaged, evaluated
and tested for suitability for reuse, and reinstalled, as possible, as part of the
alley reconstruction, taking into consideration such factors as the condition
of the historic pavers, strength of material, life expectancy if reinstalled,
quantity, and resulting aesthetic and overall appearance of the reconstructed
alley. Any reinstalled historic pavers shall be placed in a contiguous area,
rather than randomly mixed in with the new pavers;
2. Salvaged and new wood-block pavers shall be installed in the historic
paving pattern, except that for the middle ‘T’ intersection of the alley, a
herringbone pattern may be used to provide additional strength against
vehicle turning movements; and,
3. Historic Preservation staff shall review and approve the following prior to
any work occurring:
a) the salvage, evaluation, possible treatment to extend life expectancy and
reuse of salvaged pavers;
b) the paving pattern, including the location and pattern of any reinstalled
salvaged pavers, preferably in a contained area to highlight and
distinguish from the new pavers;
c) details of the concrete collar edge, paving pattern, border between the
two different paving patterns, proposed paving bed and pedestrian lights.

 Any new light fixtures shall be a simpler, more contemporary light
fixture.
2.

2042 N. Orleans
(Mid-North District –43rd Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed rehabilitation of existing 2-story single-family residential building,
including new rear and rooftop additions, decks and new masonry garage

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. Rooftop Addition
a) As proposed, the front of the rooftop addition shall be set back no less
than 14’-6” from the outside edge of the parapet, with the first 24’-0” on
the south end to be set back no less than 7’-6” from the outside edge of
the south parapet and the remaining length of the penthouse set back a
minimum of 4’-0” from the edge of the south parapet, all as depicted on
the plans;
b) As proposed, the eaves of the rooftop addition shall be a maximum
height of 2’-2” above the parapet benchmark point, indicated on the roof
plan as ‘X’, and the penthouse roof shall be a maximum height of 4’-2”
above the parapet benchmark point;
c) The maximum height of the skylights shall be 5’-11” above the parapet
benchmark point:
d) The parapet wall on the north side of the building shall be a maximum
height of 7’-2” above the parapet benchmark point and clad with brick
to match the wall of the neighboring house to the north to minimize
visibility;
e) Cladding on the rooftop addition walls shall be a non-reflective dark
grey color;
2. General
a) A report by a licensed structural engineer addressing how the structure
will be supported, braced, and protected, in-situ, during the demolition
of the roof, rear walls, and any floor framing shall be submitted and
details incorporated into the permit documents;
b) New windows shall match the existing windows in configuration, size,
glass size, and profiles. Brick molds shall be repaired; or, if beyond
repair, replaced in-kind to match the existing brick mold;
c) Window and skylight details are to be reviewed and approved by
Landmarks staff as part of the permit drawings and prior to purchase and
installation;
d) New masonr y shall match the existing masonry in color, size, profile,
and texture. Masonry samples shall be reviewed and approved by
Landmarks staff;
e) New mortar shall match the existing mortar in composition, color, and
joint profile;
f) As proposed, the house, side addition, and garage parapets shall meet
railing requirements for the roof decks on all required elevations;
g) Details of the limestone coping at the front parapet of the house shall be
included in the permit documents; and,

 3. Side addition
a) As proposed, the side addition is to be built upon the existing addition
footprint and will not extend further into the side yard than the existing
side addition.
3.

3619 N. Avers
(Villa District – 30th Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed dormer addition on the north side of building for an existing 1½-story
single- family bungalow

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. The proposed dormer addition on the north façade shall be modified to have
hip-roofed dormer ends, rather than gable-roofs, to match the profile, slope,
and architectural character of the existing hip-shaped dormer roofs on the
building. As discussed at the meeting, the eave height of the new dormer
may be slightly higher (approx. ±4”) than as submitted, to allow for more
interior head room. The center shed-roofed portion should be recessed at
least 10” to help break up the massing of the new dormer;
2. Given that the structure is masonry and that the new dormer is on a
secondary façade and less visible, the proposed use of 4- inch-wide smoothfinish fiber-cement siding as cladding for the proposed dormer and the
existing dormer on the south side of the building is approved; and,
3. The new windows shall match the existing windows in size, glass size,
operation, muntin arrangement, and muntin size. The new windows can,
however, be simulated divided- lite windows, as proposed given their
relative visibility and location. Existing and proposed window details shall
be submitted with the permit application.

4.

2616-18 N. Milwaukee
(Logan Square Bo ulevards District – 35th Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed exterior alterations to a 5-story, masonry non-contributing building,
including new storefronts, new window openings on the east (street) and south
facades, and refacing of an existing projecting sign, as part of conversion to
health club; also proposed removal of a section of brick masonry wall on
adjacent site of CTA Blue Line Station (also non-contributing)

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. Historic terra-cotta features beneath the existing metal panels at the groundfloor are proposed to be uncovered and repaired. Masonry cleaning
specifications and repair details shall be included in the permit application
for Landmarks staff review and approval. Any new mortar shall match the
historic mortar in color, composition, and joint profile;
2. French doors flanking the main entrance along Milwaukee Avenue are
proposed to be recessed 3’-0”from the front building line. These doors shall
align with the façade, consistent with the storefronts of commercial
buildings in the historic district, unless the 3’-0” recess is required for
exiting code requirements. Only the minimum number of doors necessary

 3.

4.

5.

6.

5.

to meet exiting requirements may be recessed. A code analysis of exiting
requirements shall be submitted for staff’s review and acceptance.
The proposed 2’-0” wide, wood French doors shall be restudied to be at
least 3’-0” wide to be more compatible with the scale, visual transparency
(i.e., glass size), and architectural character of the historic storefronts in the
district;
The existing (legal non-conforming) blade sign is proposed to be retained
and refaced with new face- lit “Cheetah Gym” lettering and a brown-colored
metal panel background. Pursuant to the PRC decision letter from 06/13/07,
the horizontal attachments shall have a different background color than the
(“Cheetah” brown) vertical portion so that the sign is broken down visually
into sections and appears less bulky. Staff suggests using either the
“Cheetah” gold or tan color.
The sign must be refurbished in place; if removed, replaced or rebuilt, it will
no longer be considered an existing sign and would need to meet landmark
district (and zoning) guidelines for new signage size, location, and design.
All lettering should be of opaque metal with halo- lighting, not face- lit plexglass as currently proposed. All signage details including final color scheme,
attachment details, lighting and material descriptions with section details
shall be reviewed and approved by Landmarks staff as part of the sign
permit application and prior to order and refacing;
Any additional signage, refacing of existing legal signs, and/or exterior light
fixtures shall be reviewed and approved by the Commission on Chicago
Landmarks;
A report by a material conservation specialist or qualified masonry
contractor on the condition of the masonry wall of the south elevation of the
building, the several existing layers of paint and any other relevant
conditions. The report shall include recommendations on any necessary
repair and long-term maintenance, and be submitted with the permit plans.
The project shall incorporate the recommendations as part of the scope of
work; and,
An approximately 38- foot- long section of a 10-foot-tall (approx.) brick
masonry wall along the property line on the adjacent site of the CTA Blue
Line Station is proposed to be removed in accommodating the new firstfloor windows on the south side of the subject building. The CTA station
was built c.1970, outside the period of significance for the district of 1880 to
1930 and, therefore, is non-contributing to the district.
The Committee suggested that the wall and mural be retained, suggesting
alternatively that new clearstory first-floor windows be installed above the
wall. Rega rdless, the wall should not be modified until a permit has been
issued for the proposed health club. Landmarks staff shall review final
details of any proposed work to the wall.

565 W. Arlington
(Arlington-Deming District – 43rd Ward)
Proposal:

(Reconsideration) Proposed alteration of front façade of residential building to
enlarge masonry window openings and install new windows

Action:

The Committee (voted: 3 -1, with one recusal; Ben Weese recused and John
Baird voted in opposition) affirmed its May 7th decision by which it (1)
preliminarily found that (i) the building is a contributing structure to the

 character of the district; and (ii) the proposed project would have an adverse
effect on the significant historical and architectural features of the building and
district due to the proposed removal of the existing windows which appear to be
part of the c.1940 re- front, or earlier, and therefore within the period of
significance for the district; and the proposed enlargement of the window
opening and the installation of a new window type and configuration that never
historically existed on the building; and (2) voted to advise the applicant that the
project should be restudied so that:
1.
2.

The existing windows are retained and repaired; or,
Subject to the determination of Landmarks staff, if the windows are
beyond repair, they may be replaced in-kind to match the originals in terms
of arrangement, size, glass size, and exterior profiles. A report or other
evidence regarding the condition of the windows and window details
would need to be submitted for Landmarks staff review and approval prior
to order and installation.
