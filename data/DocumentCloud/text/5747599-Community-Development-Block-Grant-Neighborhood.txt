Dear Council President Jones and President Pro Tern Sheffield:

This letter is to request your intervention to help resolve an important budgetary and authorization
issue on behalf of the Detroit Board of Police Commissioners (BOPC). The issue centers on the amount
and method of reimbursement (stipends) for the membership on the BOPC's 2019-2020
budget request, we included an increase of $167,500.00 in contract services for stipends paid to the
Board of Police Commissioners. If approved by your honorable body, this increase combined with the
current stipend allocation of $53,000.00 will adjust stipends available for the Board to $220,000.00? This
adjustment will allow the reimbursement for individual Commissioners to cap at $20,000.00 annual y.
The Board of Police Commissioners request to the Detroit City Council appropriate relief designed to
equalize or close the gap in the reimbursements of the police board with other boards and commissions
within the city. We also request, if needed a meeting with the leadership of the Detroit City Council to
explain the above request.

The 2012 Detroit City Charter enables the expansion of the Board of Police Commissioners from 5
appointed members to 11 members. Included in this expansion are 7 members elected in Districts, by
the people, and 4 members appointed by the Mayor. The 2012 Charter also delineated speci?c added
duties of the Board and mandated that the Board provide supervisory control and oversight to the
Detroit Police Department. Additionally, the Charter required weekly meetings of the Board. Currently
the Board of Police Commissioners meet 49 times each year. Also, on average, each Commissioner
serves on three Board level subcommittees that meet apart from the Committee of the Whole and
participate in a wide range of District based police-community engagements.

The Detroit City Charter (2012), Section 7-802 allows for the reimbursement of Commissioners by
ordinance for parking, mileage and other reasonable expenses. It is our understanding that no such
ordinance governing the reimbursement of Commissioners was enacted by the Detroit City Council,
instead Commissioners were placed in the Detroit Police Department's payroll system and assigned a
modest stipend. Starting in 2012 Commissioner stipends were set at 5 4,628 annually for regular
Commissioners and 5 6,878.56 for officers of the Board. In the past, the Board has sought
reimbursement for taxes and other deductions common to employees, but not applicable to elected and
appointed officials who work as volunteers. The above amounts have remained the same for seven
years.

The Board has petitioned the Detroit City Council and the Elected Official Compensation Commission
requesting adjustments (see attachments). Neither method has produced a result, therefore in making

this request the Board is relying on its powers as a body with powers
under Section 7-803 (sub paragraph that provides for the Board of Police Commissioners to "Review
and approve the departmental budget before its submission to the Mayor." To make this requested
change resulting in adjustments to the BOPC reimbursement, we have been advised that both an
appropriate budgetary allocations must be in place funding the increase and authorization must come
from the Detroit City Council by ordinance or directive to instruct the city's financial authorities to
implement changes to the BOPC reimbursement amount and method.

Our request for your intervention is urgent given that the city?s budget will be in front of your honorable
body within the next month. Please note the attachments to this request as they reflect the many
attempts that we have made to rectify this issue. Again, this letter is also a request for a meeting with
the Council?s leadership, if needed, to discuss the above issues. If you need any additional information
on this matter, please contact Mr. Gregory Hicks, Secretary to the Board for any additional information.

Sincerely,

RE: TAX INCENTIVE REPORT
Please see the attached report in response to your request dated January 11,2019.

This report addresses the four line items that were laid out in the memorandum. As a note, the
requirements for these projects which received tax incentives to complete their reporting to the
City is not due until the end of March, at which point more up to date data should be available.
Therefore the actual investment and jobs data in this report are the records as of March 2018.

The attached report examines all of the tax incentives approved since 2015, excluding
Neighborhood Enterprise Zone Certificates. Over that time period 93 projects have been
approved for tax incentives. Of those 93 approved, 40 projects have been completed at this
point. Of the 40 projects that have been completed, 30 of them have submitted their up to date
data as of March 2018.

Should any additional questions come up, please do not hesitate to contact me personally.

Best,

As a follow up to the report submitted in summer 2018, and to the request dated January 11, 2019, DEGC
has prepared the following responses. Additionally we have updated and prepared a line by line report of
all of the tax incentive certificates that have been approved since 2015.

1. Updated list of all tax incentives approved since 2014 including the duration and amount of the tax
incentive.

- DEGC has only been estimating the value of tax incentives since the beginning of 2015. So while the
list related to the request is attached, the time period is only from 2015 to 2018.

To summarize:
Ofthe 30 projects that have reported data, the total proposed investment was 
but the total actual investment was 
0 Of the 30 projects that have reported data, the total proposed jobs was 2,081, but the total
actual jobs is 3,403.
0 Additionally, 961 of those 3,403 jobs are Detroiters.

2. Methods used to determine the length of tax incentives.

- DEGC does a comprehensive review of every project that requests a tax incentive in the City of
Detroit. The review involves a multitude of steps and an in depth investigation of a project and its
financials.

Initially DEGC examines whether a project is feasible for development and aligns with the City?s policy
goals. There is also consideration that the project has already exhausted all options for traditional
sources of financing, and that this project would not happen but for the requested tax incentive. The
?but for? analysis involves the DEGC team reviewing the project to confirm that the development
costs, post construction rental assumptions, and post construction operating expenses are all in line
with City and Region norms.

Once confirmed that the submitted financial data is reasonably within the established appropriate
range for that specific type of project, DEGC investigates the project under several different
scenarios. These scenarios are initially a review of the financials with and without the tax incentive.
Upon confirmation that the project exhibits a need for the incentive to make it financially feasible, a
sensitivity analysis takes place to determine the required number of years for the incentive. This
sensitivity analysis primarily relates to how the incentive affects the debt service coverage ratio
(DSCR) of a project.

Sill] STREET SUITE 2an - DEIRUIT Ml 48226 - 3 3553 254i] FAX 3 3953 8835

The standard debt service coverage ratios that lenders are looking for is in the 1.30 to 1.50 range.
Anything less than that will likely damage a project?s potential of receiving lending. DEGC determines
how long it takes for a project?s DSCR to exceed the 1.50 threshold and makes the recommendation
for number of years of incentive based on that. Due to the complex capital stacks of most projects in
Detroit, the full length of the incentive is necessary most of the time.

Additionally, DEGC utilizes a fiscal and economic impact analysis to determine that after accounting
for City costs (providing services to businesses and residents) the project still provides a net benefit to
the City. The model used for this analysis is custom geared for Detroit and was developed in
partnership with Impact Data Source, a regional economic impact consulting firm whose clients
include municipalities and regions across the United States. The model takes in data from a variety of
sources including, but not limited to: Bureau of Labor Statistics, US Census, American Community
Survey, and the City of Detroit Comprehensive Annual Fiscal Report.

Average length of tax incentives.

The average length of incentives awarded since 2015 is 10.8 years.
0 However,
I The percent of incentives reduced in time period in 2015 was 7%
I The percent of incentives reduced in time period in 2016 was 13%
I The percent of incentives reduced in time period in 2017 was 5%
I The percent of incentives reduced in time period in 2018 was 22%

Last year was the year where the largest percentage of projects were reduced in tax incentive time
penod.

Feasibility of reducing the maximum length of tax incentives to 6 to 9 years.
Because each project goes through the same standard underwriting process, reducing the length of

the tax incentives is always considered. However, due to a number of factors most projects do in fact
necessitate the full time period provided by the incentive statutes.

Unit 2 consisting of forty-five (45) low income housing residential units located in a building in an
area bounded by Seward Street on the north, Woodward Avenue on the east, Delaware Street on
the south and Second Avenue on the west.

The full gut rehabilitation Project includes fourteen (14) 1 bedroom/1 bath and thirty-one (31)
2 bedroom/2 bath apartments. The ten-story building includes two (2) first floor community
rooms. Tenant parking will be located directly across Seward.

The Project will be financed by a $14,000,000 Construction Loan converting to a Permanent Loan
with JP Morgan Chase Bank. A Michigan State Housing Development Authority Low Income
Housing Tax Credit award in an annual amount of $1,310,570 has been reserved. Additionally, the
Sponsor has agreed to defer $445,856 of the developer fee.

Rents for all units have been set at or below sixty percent of the area median income,
adjusted for family size. All residents will contribute no more than thirty percent of their
adjusted gross income towards the rent amount. All forty-five (45) units will be subject to the
PILOT based on Section 15a of the State Housing Development Authority Act of 1966, as amended.

In order to make this development economically feasible, it is necessary for it to receive the
benefits of tax exemption under Section 15a of the State Housing Development Authority Act of
1966 (PA. 346 as amended, MCL 125.1415A).

Adoption of the resolution by your Honorable Body will therefore satisfy the requirements of
Public Act 346 and City Ordinance 9-90, as amended, by establishing a service charge often
percent of the annual net shelter rent obtained from this housing project.

DATE: January 24, 2019
RE: Requesting Resolution Urging Governor Gretchen

Whitmer to Review the Pension Tax Policy

Several states in the country do not tax pensions as an income tax. Other states
provide substantial tax exemptions for pension income. Taxing pension income
places an undue burden on elderly Detroit residents, making Michigan a less
competitive state for those who seek to retire.

Please draft a resolution urging Governor Gretchen Whitmer to collaborate
with the Michigan Legislature to eliminate the tax on non-exempt pensions.
Additionally, please provide a report which lists the states that do not tax
pension income and review the policies that have been implemented in those
states.

RE: Detroit Animal Care and Control

 

There is a lack of awareness surrounding the requirements of owning dogs in
Detroit, especially as it relates to the licensing requirements and the conditions
under which dogs may be kept outside.

What is the anticipated cost for a city-wide marketing strategy for Detroit
Animal Care and Control to inform residents of licensing requirements, anti-
tethering requirements, the reporting of non-compliant pet-owners, and other
requirements related to Detroit Animal Care and Control Department?
