1553

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 17, 2005

SECTION 4. REVIEW OF CONTRACT COSTS.
a.

Estimate of costs. Prior to considering whether to enter into a privatization contract, the Board or
County shall prepare a comprehensive written estimate of the costs of regular County employees
providing the subject services in the most cost-efficient manner. The estimate shall include all
direct and indirect costs of regular County employees providing the subject services, including but
not limited to pension, insurance and other employee benefit costs. For the purpose of this
estimate, any employee organization may, at any time before the final day for the Board or County
to receive sealed bids pursuant to Section 3(b), propose amendments to any relevant collective
bargaining agreement to which it is a party. Any such amendments sha ll take effect on ly if
necessary to reduce the cost estimate pursuant to this paragraph below the contract cost. Such
estimate shall remain confidential until after the final day for the Board and County to receive
sea led bids for the privatization contract at which time the estimate shall become a public record,
shall be filed in the Board or County to recei ve and shall be published in a newspaper of general
circulation by the Board or County.

b.

Evaluation of Contractor Performance and Costs. After soliciting and receiving bids, the Board or
County shall publicly designate the bidder to which it proposes to award the privatization contract.
In selecting a contractor, the Board or County shall consider the contractor's past performance and
its record of compliance with federal, state and local laws, including the disclosures as required in
Section 3(c). The Board or County shall prepare a comprehensive written analysis of the contract
cost based upon the designated bid, specifically including the costs of transition from public to
private operation, of additiona l unemployment and retirement benefits, if any, and of monitoring
and otherwise ad ministering contract performance. If the designated bidder proposes to perform
any or all of the contract outside the boundaries of Cook County, said contract cost shall be

OFFICE OF THE CHIEF JUDGE
GRANT APPLICATION
Transmitting a Communication, dated April 7, 2005 from
TIMOTHY C. EVANS, Chief Judge, Circuit Court of Cook County
requesting authorization to apply for a grant in the amount of $200,000.00 from the U.S. Department of
Justice, Office of Justice Programs. This grant is made available through the Drug Court Discretionary
Grant Program, and will fund gender-responsive treatment services to felony offenders who have
significant mental illness and substance abuse disorders.
In April 2004, the Circuit Court of Cook County launched a Mental Health Court pilot program in the
Criminal Division to enhance the supervision of mentally ill offenders by improving the delivery of
mental health care, with the ultimate goal of reducing incarceration of program participants. In its first
year of operation, the program admitted 31 felony probationers, both male and female, most of whom
have substance abuse disorders in addition to chronic mental illness and other health concerns, such as
positive tests for HIV. Early program results are encouraging, as recidivism for the pilot program group
has been substantially reduced . The grant funds will be used to increase the participant capacity of the
pilot program over a 12-month period by an additional 70 to 80 offenders who have co-occurring
disorders. The program outcomes will be carefully measured in compliance with the Adult Probation
Department's comprehensive evaluation protocols.
This grant requires a cash match in the amount of $66,667.00. However, the court's program provider,
Treatment Alternatives for Safe Communities (TASC), has agreed to provide the matching funds.
The Budget Department has reviewed this item, and all requisite documents have been submitted.
Estimated Fiscal Impact:
through August 31, 2006.

None. Grant Award:

$200,000.00. Funding period:

DEPARTMENT OF RISK MANAGEMENT
CONTRACT

Transmitting a Communication from
JOHN L. HIBBETT, Director, Department of Risk Management
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with David Corporation, San
Francisco, California, for the purchase of an upgraded version of a hi ghly specialized workers
compensation software and the implementation services of the software.
Reason:

The current in-house version of workers compensation software is a twenty year old DOSbased system that has become incompatible with much of the windows based Department for
Management of Information Systems (MIS) environment, and it no longer receives warranty
support from the vendor. The reliability of the system has become questionable and no
longer meets the processing and reporting requirements needed to support the annual work
volume of 1800 claims that generate $12.5 million in payments to injured workers and
medical vendors. The software establishes claims, tracks histories, adjusts for deductions and
directs payments to workers and medical care providers.
Upgrading the workers
compensation system will support the department 's lean resources dedicated to performing
this financial function and is a more cost efficient alternative than out-sourcing this service.

1598

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 17, 2005

1.

This upgrade and implementation is being performed on the original software by the
original vendor.

2.

The software and upgrade process are proprietary services that require the expertise and
knowledge of this original vendor.

for this proprietary software.

Sufficient funds have been appropriated to cover this request.

Agent be authorized to enter into the requested contract. The motion carried unanimously.

VILLAGE OF HOMEWOOD
NO CASH BID REQUEST
Transmitting a Communication, dated May 9, 2005 from
DEBORAH SIMS, Chairman, Tax Delinquency Subcommittee
Submitting a request from
Richard A. Holfeld, Village President
Re: No Cash Bid Program Request
This is a request for a No Cash Bid on behalf of the Village of Homewood, Cook County, Illinois.
The Subject Property is a vacant landlocked parcel that has been tax delinquent for many years. The
Subject Property located at 3349 l 83rd Street, Homewood, Illinoi s, is described as follows:
Lot 1 (except the South 265 feet thereof) in Blackthorn Hall, being a resubdivision
of the South 375 feet of Lot 2 in Homewood Garden Acres No. 1, being a subdivision
of the North 112 of the Northeast 1/4 of the Northeast 1/4 of Section 2, Township 35
North, Range 13 East of the Third Principal Meridian, Cook County, Illinois.

PROPERTY INDEX NUMBER
31-02-201-052-0000
The Village of Homewood has approved a three building multi-family development by DeBello Builders,
Inc. on property adjacent to the Subject Property. However, DeBello' s proposed project does not have
sufficient land to create a necessary detention area as required by the Homewood Stormwater
Management provisions of its Municipal Code. Should the Village of Homewood acquire title by tax
deed to the Subject Property it will in turn convey the Subject Property to DeBello Builders, Inc. for use
as a detention area to satisfy the Village's Stormwater Management requirements. This will allow
DeBello's multi-family proposed development to proceed, which will in turn, improve the Village's tax
base and provide additional multi-family availability within the Village.

1607

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 17, 2005

Submitted is a certified copy of Ordinance M-1630 passed and approved by the Homewood Village
Board April 26, 2005. This Ordinance requests a No Cash Bid for the Subject Property. Also a title
search evidencing numerous outstanding back taxes for the Subject Property, a portion of a Sidwell map
with the Subject Property highlighted and photographs of the Subject Property has been submitted.
DeBello Builders, Inc. is located in Frankfort, Illinois and the principal officer thereof is Nick DeBello,
President. The Village believes that DeBello Builders, Inc. has the capacity to complete its proposed
three building multi-family development and also the capacity to use the Subject Property as a detention
area to satisfy the Village's Stormwater Management requirements.
The Village affirms that its Village Attorney will represent the Village in obtaining the requested tax deed
for the delinquent parcel and the Village will pay all legal and other costs associated with the acquisition
of the parcel.

Commissioner Sims, seconded by Commissioner Murphy, moved that the communication be referred to
the Committee on Tax Delinquency Subcommittee. (Comm. No. 271169). The motion carried

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 17, 2005

Finance Chairman Daley and Health and Hospitals Chairman Butler stated that the meetings of the
respective committees would be held jointly.
Commissioner Peraica asked Daniel H. Winship, M.D. , Chief, Bureau of Health Services, to provide
additional background information regarding the contract.
Dr. Winship stated the following : in December of 2004 the Bureau of Health Services began developing
the plan for the pharmaceutical contract and the RFP. This group was formed last month; it is comprised
of several divisions from the Bureau of Health Services, the State 's Attorney's Office, the Cook County
Purchasing Agent and the Office of Contract Compliance. The McKesson Corporation contract
terminates on June 30, 2005; the Bureau of Health Services expects to have sufficient time to develop the
contract. A goal of the contract is to obtain pharmaceutical supplies less expensively by opening up the
bidding process. Additionally, by separating out the various contract components, the Bureau will be able
to obtain a better price for the next three years.
Dr. Winship requested that the head of the team, Dan Martin, Deputy Chief, Bureau of Health Services,
further answer Commissioner Peraica 's question.
President Stroger stated the following: the concept originated with Ruth Rothstein, former Chief, Bureau
of Health Services. Mr. Martin has been with the Bureau of Health Services since the beginning of the
concept and Mr. Martin has been involved in every aspect of the healthcare delivery system. Mr. Martin
was the fonner Chief Operating Officer of Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County and he initiated the
program that was developed by Ms. Rothstein.
Commissioner Maldonado requested that Mr. Martin address the Committee to explain the difference
between the Group Purchasing Organization and the Pharmaceutical Prime Vendor Wholesale/Distributor
functions. Commissioner Maldonado also inquired why it is important to separate these functions.
Commissioner Suffredin asked whether the four-month extension is adequate and whether McKesson is
agreeable to the four-month time frame.
Mr. Martin replied that the four-month extension is sufficient; McKesson has agreed to this extension as
has the Purchas ing Alliance for C linical Therapeutics (PACT). Mr. Martin further stated that this Group
Purchasing Organization has a separate contract under the McKesson umbrella.
Commissioner Suffredin asked whether the 340B purchasing would fall under a different category. He
next inquired whether the County is able to enter into the 340B agreement before the four-month
extension is completed, and whether McKesson wi ll hold the County liable for any lost sales.
Mr. Martin replied that McKesson conducts all purchases of pharmaceutica ls. If the 340B Prime Vendor
Program is approved by the County, then the pricing structure would automatically flow into the current
McKesson contract.
Commissioner Peraica asked when the 3408 program was initiated.
Mr. Martin replied that the program was initiated two years ago. The 3408 Prime Vendor Program was a
result of recent changes in Federal regulations. Within the last year the Federal Government has altered
the program to allow more individuals to participate.
Commi ssioner Peraica asked whether the County participated in the price discounting programs.

1621

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 17, 2005

Mr. Martin replied that the County has participated in the price discounting programs for many years with
the exception of Cermak Health Services of Cook County which is not designated as a disproportionate
share hospital.
Chairman Daley entered into the record a memo from the Bureau of Health Services which amends
several account numbers and amounts. (The referenced document is on file in the Office of the County
Clerk.)
Commissioner Butler asked Alvin Holley, Chief Financial Officer, Bureau of Health Services, to read the
amendment into the record.
Fiscal Impact: $29,000,000.00,
Mr. Holley read the amendments into the record as follows:
$1,800,000.00 $2,260,000.00 - Cermak Health Services of Cook County (240-361 and 240-364
Accounts); $4,64 4,000.00 $5,200,000.00 - Provident Hospital of Cook County (891-361 and 891 364
Accounts); $216,000.00 $250,000.00 - Department of Public Health (895-361 and 895 364 Accounts);
$17,300,000.00 $17, 190,000.00 - Stroger Hospital of Cook County (897-361 and 897-364 Accounts);
and $5,040,000.00 $4,100,000.00 - Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County (898-361 and 898-364
Accounts).

BUREAU OF HEALTH SERVICES, by Daniel H. Winship, M.D., Chief, transmitting a
Communication, dated April 12, 2005:
On June 30, 2005, Contract No. 02-43-960, Pharmaceutical Purchasing Program with
McKesson Corporation, and Contract No. 02-43-961, Group Purchasing Organization with
Purchasing Alliance for Clinical Therapeutics (PACT), are scheduled to expire.
Together, these two contracts comprise what is known as the Bureau of Health Services
Phannacy Prime Vendor Program. This program bas been in effect for the past three years
and has proven to be successful in terms of consistently providing pharmaceutical products
required for the care of our patients and enabling the County to lower its costs and improve
the management of its pharmaceutical services.
In preparation for the expiration of these contracts, representatives from the offices of the
Purchasing Agent, Contract Compliance, State's Attorney and the Bureau of Health Services
have been meeting to review the program and to develop plans and recommendations to
allow for the continuation of the program. As a result of these meetings, the Bureau of
Health Services submits the following recommendations:
1.

separate the procurements of a group purchasing organization and a pharmaceutical
prime vendor (wholesale/distributor) for the next contract cycle, in order to provide a
greater opportunity for competition among prospective contractors and thereby
achieve potential additional cost savings;

2.

separate the procurement of a contract for medical assistance program services from
the procurement of a prime vendor in order to limit the deliverables under the prime
vendor contract;

3.

issue a request for proposals for a group purchasing organization;

1622

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 17, 2005

4.

issue an advertisement for bids for a prime vendor (wholesaler/distributor);

5.

issue an advertisement for bids for medical assistance program services; and

6. enter into an agreement for the Bureau of Health Services to participate in the new
Federal 340 Prime Vendor Program in order to obtain even deeper discounts on
purchases eligible for this program.
In order to implement these recommendations, I am requesting authorization for the
following actions:
1. To issue a Request for Proposals for group purchasing organization services.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: None. Contract period:
October 31 , 2008. Requisition No. 58900601.
2.

November 1, 2005 through

For the Purchasing Agent to advertise for bids for a phannaceutical prime vendor
(wholesale/distributor) to include the same expedited payment arrangements as were
authorized by the Cook County Board of Commissioners in connection with Contract
No. 02-43-960 with McKesson Corporation.
Contract period: November 1, 2005 through October 31, 2008. (240-361, 891-361 ,
895-361, 897-36 1 and 898-361 Accounts). Requisition Nos. 52400251, 58910566,

services.
Contract period: November 1, 2005 through October 3 1, 2008. (890-260 Account).
Requisition No. 58900602.

4.

For the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with Healthcare Purchasing
Partnership International, Arlington, Texas, the federally designated administrator of
the 340B Prime Vendor Program to effectuate County participation in this program.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: None. Contract period:
October 31 , 2008. Requisition No. 58900600.

Note: This item was also referred to the Committee on Health and Hospitals. (See
Comm. No. 270974).
*Referred to the Finance Committee on 05/03/05.
Commissioner Hansen asked whether this contract represents an unfair bias for McKesson.
Mr. Martin stated that four years ago the Bureau of Health Services issued an RFP in an effort to reduce
pharmaceutical expenditures for the coming year. Many of the healthcare organizations participate in
either a Prime Vendor or a Group Purchasing Organization. Most organizations either belong to a Group
Purchasing Organization or work with a wholesale distributor which delivers products directly and keeps
any inventory; payment is made directly to the wholesale distributor. A Group Purchasing Organization
negotiates pricing for pharmaceutical and medical supplies on behalf of its members. This organization is
able to leverage greater purchasing power.

1623

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 17, 2005

Mr. Martin continued that the County issued the RFP to save money and to detennine which programs
would benefit the County. Five or six vendors replied to the RFP; McKesson submitted a particularly
comprehensive program. They offered a group purchasing organization, a wholesaler distributor function
and a medication assistance program. Additionally, McKesson seeks reimbursement on behalf of its
members from various drug manufacturer programs. Such reimbursement covers products that have been
dispensed to indigent patients. Family size and income are evaluated to determine whether a patient
qualifies for indigent status.
Mr. Martin stated that at the time the contract was awarded, Cook County had numerous pharmaceutical
contracts in place. The County allowed the contracts to expire and then rolled them into the Prime
Vendor Program.
Mr. Martin continued that only a few Group Purchasing Organizations possess both a wholesaler and a
medication assistance program; this limits the number of RFP responses. There exist three prices that the
County could pay for the drugs from McKesson: the negotiated Group Purchasing Organization price;
the price McKesson would pay for were they purchasing independently from the manufacturer which is
termed the " Average Wholesale Acquisition Cost"; or the 340B Program price. If the drug is for inpatient
use or for a facility that is not designated as a disproportionate share hospital facility, the Bureau would
then purchase the drugs through a Group Purchasing Organization, which can then negotiate a price better
than the Average Wholesa le Price.
Commissioner Hansen asked whether the County can buy drugs directly from, for example, Abbott
Laboratories.
Mr. Martin replied in the negative; they will not sell directly to the County.
Commissioner Maldonado stated that because the County is part of the Federal 340B Prime Vendor
Program, the County is guaranteed the lowest possible price for phannaceutical s.
Mr. Martin stated that the 340B drug program contains a pricing schedule and ceilings set by the Federal
Government. Under Federal regulations no one can pay less than the VA system price; this price is the
lowest that is sold to the Federal Government. The difference between the 340B's ceiling price and the
VA ' s price ranges between seven and eleven percent; this price difference could yield the County cost
savings. The Federal Governments Group Purchasing Organization is organized to achieve a 340B price
which is between the VA price and the ceiling price.
Commissioner Maldonado asked whether the County could competitively bid for a contract with a Group
Purchasing Organization.
Mr. Martin replied that there is no dollar value assigned to a Group Purchasing Organization contract.
This makes it difficult to evaluate cost; one is not purchasing directly from a Group Purchasing
Organization but is joining an organization that will extend favorable pricing. The actual dollar
expenditures are agreed upon by the wholesaler and the County.
Commissioner Maldonado inquired whether the County pays a fee to join the Group Purchasing
Organization.
Mr. Martin replied that some Group Purchasing· Organizations have a nominal joining fee of $300 to
$400.

1624

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 17, 2005

Commissioner Quigley inquired how the County is pursuing this agreement differently compared to the
way the County sought an agreement with McKesson.
Mr. Martin replied that the last time the County issued an RFP, the County notified various potential
Group Purchasing Organizations and pharmaceutical wholesalers. Presently, the County is seeking to
replicate a ll aspects of the contracts. The RFP will be publicly advertised on the County website and
through other venues.
Commissioner Quigley inquired how the County will determine the best competitive pnces on
pharmaceuticals.
Mr. Martin replied that on the Group Purchasing Organization side, the County will include in the RFP a
list of the types of drugs purchased during FY 2004 and the quantities, and then the Group Purchasing
Organizations can compare their drug list with the County 's and formulate pric ing. As a result of the RFP
process, the County will compare the cost of purchases from various Group Purchasi ng Organizations.
F ina lly, the County would consider the term of the contract before choosing a Group Purchasing
Organization contract.
Commissioner Silvestri inquired whether there has been any consideration of how contracting with
multiple companies impacts cost savings and service.
Mr. Martin replied that if an organization belongs to a Group Purchasing Organization, the determined
prices are provided to the wholesa ler which that organization selects. The who lesaler would honor these
prices.
Commissioner Silvestri asked who enters the prices into the database.
Mr. Martin replied that the wholesaler/distributor enters the prices.
In response to Chairman Daley's question regarding whether pricing of phannaceuticals through the
Group Purchasing Organization is based on volume, Mr. Martin repl ied in the affirmative, and noted that
new generic drugs also affect the pricing structure.
Chainnan Daley asked Mr. Martin to explain why the County does not utilize, for example, Wa lgreen' s or
Osco for prescriptions for outpatients.
Mr. Martin responded the County would not be elig ible for the federal 340B Prime Vendor Program.
Commissioner Collins asked how many County contracts currently supply pharmaceuticals to the Bureau
of Health Services.
Mr. Martin replied there is currently one pharmaceutical contract, which is with McKesson.
Commissioner Collins asked whether Cook County assumed the responsibility for distribution and for the
Gro up Purchasing Organization.
Mr. Marti n replied that the Group Purchasing Organization distributes and negotiates prices.

Vice Chairman Steele, seconded by Commissioner Hansen, moved the approval of Communication
No. 270973. The motion carried.
Commissioner Silvestri moved to adjourn the meeting, seconded by Commissioner Peraica. T he
motion carried and the meeting was adjourned.

270717

BUREAU OF FINANCE by Thomas J. Glaser, Chief Financial Officer, transmitting a
Communication, dated April 12, 2005:
Subject: Credit Card Pilot Program
requesting authorization to enter into a two-year contract, with the option to renew for an
additional three-year period, with Government Payment Systems (GPS)*, Indianapolis,
Indiana, to implement fiscal year 2004 Budget Amendment No. 27 which established a goal
for the Chief Financial Officer to initiate a pilot program utilizing credit cards as payment of
cash bail for detainees at the Department of Corrections. GPS was selected through a
Request for Proposal (RFP) process and was chosen for the following reasons:
•
•
•
•
•

Only respondent to offer a no-cost solution to the County
Company was the only one to accept all major credit cards
Only respondent to handle all charge backs; no risk to the County
Will accept more than one credit card for a single transaction
Can be up and running within two weeks

Reason:

This program should enable more detainees to post bail which should reduce the
population and operating costs at the jail. Should this program work as expected,
the office would look to expand use of the program to other offices and fees.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: None.

*Referred to the Committee on Finance on 04/19/05.
Commissioner Butler stated that the use of credit cards as payment of cash bail for detainees would lead
to greater indebtedness for an already financially vulnerable community. Commissioner Butler
commented that he did not have a problem with the concept of this program, but reiterated his concern
that many individuals and their families would not fully understand the financial ramifications of the
proposed pilot program.
Commissioner Quigley stated that the credit card option would reduce jail overcrowding. He also noted
examples in which an individual can not make bond, the resultant hardships placed on their families for
lost wages, and why a detainee may plead guilty simply to get out of jail. This pilot program provides
detainees with an option.
President Stroger concurred with the statement put forth by Commissioner Quigley.

1627

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 17, 2005

Commissioner Maldonado stated this is a voluntary program, and will be a great option for the detainees.
He suggested to the proposed vendor, Government Payment Systems, that they provide adequate
literature, and post signs explaining the fee/surcharge associated with this program. Commissioner
Maldonado also noted that the proposed vendor is taking on the risk of incurring bad debt.
Commissioner Suffredin voiced his support for the pilot program, and hopes it is the first step in utilizing
credit cards throughout county agencies. He stated that credit cards are a part of the commerce in today' s
day and age.
Commissioner Claypool inquired whether a particular user's credit limit would be subject to his own
personal credit history.
Thomas J. Glaser, Chief Financial Officer, replied in the affirmative.
In response to Commissioner Claypoo l's question regarding another prospective respondent to the RFP,
Mr. Glaser stated Midwest Computer Systems did not offer a no-cost solution to the county in that the
county was at risk for potential charge backs.
Commissioner Murphy noted that this is a point-of-service product and that 100% reimbursement to the
County is guaranteed. She emphasized that this financial product is utilized by fifty-two jails in lllinois
and by over two-hundred jails nationwide.
Dale Conrad, Chief Executive Officer, Government Payment Systems, offered the following clarification:
there are two ways to process a credit card payment: a point-of-sale transaction and a cash advance
transaction. The program under consideration utilizes the point-of-sale transaction process. Cash
advance transaction rates are processed at rates as high as 19.86%, whereas point-of-sale transactions are
processed at approximately 5.7%-9%. This makes the program feasible for the credit card holder.
Vice Chairman Steele noted that the pilot program would protect the detainees by providing them with an
option other than detainment.
In response to Vice Chairman Steele's question regarding how and when the county will receive the
money, Mr. Glaser replied the county would receive the money within twenty-four hours. He explained a
report is issued to the Office of the Clerk of the Circuit Court, and staff will reconcile the report with the
funding. Thereafter, the money will be deposited in the Bail Bond fund.
Commissioner Hansen commented this program may allow an individual more time to make a more
infonned decision. He also recommended that the program be expanded over time.
Commissioner Gorman noted that there is no taxpayer cost associated with the credit card pilot program.
She also noted that the program could be operational in two weeks.
Commissioner Sims asked Donna Dunnings, Director of Budget and Management Services, to comment
on the pilot program.
Ms. Dunnings replied that while the program provides the option of credit card charging, there is a fee
associated with this.
Commissioner Sims made the distinction that the cost incurred by the detainee includes both the service
charge and the credit card interest.

1628

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 17, 2005

Mr. Glaser remarked that the point-of-transaction fee is determined independently of the bail amount.
Commissioner Sims voiced her concern that the incurred-debt interest would prove too extensive for the
credit card holders to manage.
Mr. Glaser replied that the credit card holder possesses the option of paying the incurred debt during the
first billing cycle.
Commissioner Sims voiced her concern that this program would place undue financia l burden upon the
fami ly of the detainees.
Comm issioner Moreno stated this program was brought forth as a result of a budgetary amendment he
proposed for the 2004 budget. He noted that accessing a system to be able to bond out of jail would
reduce the jail population, and estimates the cost savings as approximately $30-$40 million per year.
Commi ssioner Peraica cited as favorable the optional nature of the credit card transaction. He related that
Government Payment Systems had infonned him that relevant financial literature would be provided to
the credit card holder at the transaction point.
Commi ssioner Silvestri stated that the program could provide the citizens with the option of being able to
help remove their loved ones from jail.
Chairman Daley requested that Mr. Glaser provide information regarding the predicted impact that the
credit card pilot program would have upon the percentage change of the following: number of detainees
capable of posting bail; jail population ; and operating cost.
Mr. Glaser stated that he was unable to provide these figures to the Board presently; however, he was in
the process of identifying and quantifying a baseline. He further stated that he would supply the Board
with this information as soon as possible.

Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Peraica, moved approval of Communication
No. 270717. The motion carried. Commissioner Butler voted no, and Commissioner Sims voted
present.

WHEREAS, in accordance with Section 33 of the Resolution and Annual Appropriation Bill
for the Fiscal Year 2005, approved by the Board of Commissioners of Cook County on
February 24, 2005, in which it states that "the Director of the Department of Budget and
Management Services and the Comptroller are authorized to correct any factual errors in the
Annual Appropriation Bill and to implement the adopted Amendments with any required
modifications"; and
WHEREAS, FY 2005 Amendment Number 33, sponsored by Commissioners Larry
Suffredin and Forrest Claypool, which " reduces funding for open pos itions to 9 months," and
Amendment Number 35 sponsored by Commissioners Larry Suffredin and Forrest Claypool,
which "reduces funding for open positions to 6 months," were both presented by the sponsors
to the Board for their approval with the intent to reduce personnel expenditures by reducing
funding for open positions; and
WHEREAS, certain Members of the Board of Commissioners utilize contractual services
paid from monies transferred from their 110 Account to the 289 Account, in which case a
person is not hired and employed by the County of Cook, but is instead contracted to do a
particular task related to the member's office, and therefore the position from which the
contractual services are paid is depleted each year and was not intended to be considered
open or vacant for the purposes of Amendment Numbers 33 and 35.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook
County declares that it did not intend that Amendment Numbers 33 and 35 apply to the Grade
016 positions of those Commissioners who in prior years transferred the funds from the
Grade 016-110 Account to the 289 Account thereby depleting the funds in those Grade 016110 Accounts; and further directs that the Director of Budget & Management Services retHffi
any monies taken i:mrsuant to Amendme11t ·N umbers 33 and 35 from tl'lese Commissioners'
Grade 016 110 Accmrnts to transfer the amount by which the Grade 016 positions at issue
were reduced from the 814 Account (Appropriation Adjustments) into the 110 Account
(Salaries and Wages of Regular Employees) from these Grade 16 positions.

discretion of each Commissioner"; and

1657

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 17, 2005

WHEREAS, in accordance with Section 7 of the Resolution and Annual Appropriation Bill
for the Fiscal Year 2005, approved by the Board of Commissioners of Cook County on
February 24, 2005, in which it states that " the Director of Budget & Management Services is
also authorized to transfer amounts from the 110 account to the 289 account for members of
the Cook County Board of Comm issioners not to exceed the position salary available for this
purpose"; and
WHEREAS, in accordance with Section 33 of the Resolution and Annual Appropriation Bill
for the Fiscal Year 2005 , approved by the Board of Commissioners of Cook County on
February 24, 2005, in which it states that " the Director of the Departme nt of Budget and

paid from monies transferred from their 110 Account to the 289 Account, in which case a
person is not hired and employed by the County of Cook, but is instead contracted to do a
pa rticular task related to the member's office, and therefore the position fro m which the

County declares that it did not intend that Amendment N umbers 33 and 35 apply to the
Grade 016 positions of those Commissioners who in prior years transferred the funds from
the Grade 0 I 6-110 Account to the 289 Account thereby depleting the funds in those Grade

return aAy moAies takeA pursuaAl to AmeAdmeAt Numbers 33 aAd 35 from these
Commissioners' Grade 016 l l 0 Aeeounts to transfer the amount by which the Grade 016

110 Account (Salaries and Wages of Regular E mployees) from these Grade 16 positions.
*R eferred to the Committee on Finance, as Amended on 05/03/05.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Committee on Audit of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County met pursuant to notice on
Tuesday, May 3, 2005 at the hour of 2:30 P.M. in the Board Room, Room 569, County Building, 118
North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois.
Your Committee has considered the following items and upon adoption of this report, the
recommendations are as follows:
I . 265626 BUREAU OF FINANCE, by Thomas J. Glaser, Chief Financial Officer, transmitting a
Communication, dated May 12, 2004:
Subject: Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR)
Submitted is a copy of Cook Co unty's Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) for
the fiscal year ended November 30, 2002 prepared by Deloitte & Touche, LLP. The fiscal
year 2002 CAFR represents the first year in which the financial statements are in
conformance with the new GASB 34 reporting model. Please review the Introductory and
Management' s Discussion Analys is Sections to better understand the financial activities of
the County. I am hereby requesting the opportunity to discuss this report with the Audit
Committee of the Board of Commissioners.

*Referred to the Audit Committee on 05/ 18/04.
*Deferred at the Audit Committee Meeting of 06/03/04.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 17, 2005

Chairman Daley asked the Secretary whether there were any changes to the agenda.
Michelle Harris, Secretary of the Board, replied that there was an errata that had been distributed
previously to all members of the Committee.
Walter K . Knorr, Comptroller, stated that the 2002 Comprehensive Financial Report was in full
compliance with GASB standards for governmental units. Changes to the new accounting standards
included the following: reporting fonnat; putting fixed assets on the County books; full management
analysis; and discussion of the results for 2002. According to the auditors fro m Deloitte & Touche and
the consortium involved, there was a collective opinion regarding compliance and the 2002 results.
Commissioner Hansen stated that merging the results of the Forest Preserve District with those of Cook
County is not feasible because they are two separate governments. He inquired whether the County could
explore this idea with the Forest Preserve Distric t again since the 2002 Comprehensive Financial Report
has combined the figures from the Forest Preserve District with those of Cook County. He further stated
that placing reports of both governments in the same book was meaningless from the standpoint of the
bond rating agencies. If there was an error in the Forest Preserve District, it should not be addressed in
the County's report and vice versa. The County should ta lk to the Govern mental Accounting Standards
Board about addressing the issue.
Mr. Knorr stated that from GASB's viewpoint, both governmenta l financia l reports are under the
authority of the same Board. He further stated that there were both a separate audit and a financial report
for the Forest Preserve District so the County can disaggregate.

Commissioner Butler, seconded by Commissioner Hansen moved to receive and file Item No. 1
(Communication No. 265626). The motion carried.
2. 268944 BUREAU OF FINANCE, by Thomas J. Glaser, Chief F inancial Officer, transmitting a
Communication dated, December 15, 2004:
Subject: Cook County, Illino is - M emorandum on Internal Control Structure for Fiscal Year
Ending November 30, 2002
submitting herewith a copy of the County 's " Memorandum on Inte rnal Contro l" prepared by
Deloitte & Touche, LLP for fiscal year ending November 30, 2002. I am hereby requesting
that this item be referred to the Audit Committee for further discussion. Please note that the

addressed or corrective action is currently underway.

*Referred to the Audit Committee on 01/05/05.
Commissioner Hansen asked whether the payroll system had been completed.
Mr. Knorr replied that complete implementation of the payroll modules of the Financial Management
Information System (FMIS) for the Bureau of Health Services starts July 24, 2005.
Commissioner Hansen asked whether this collaboration was expected to reduce operating costs and if so
how much .

1669

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 17, 2005

Mr. Knorr replied that he didn 't have an estimate for cost savings. He further stated that it would go back
to payroll departments that are under FMIS to see what benefits it provides.
Commissioner Hansen inquired whether FMIS had a goal. He requested that Mr. Knorr provide the
information to Chairman Daley and the Committee.
Commissioner Hansen asked Mr. Knorr to explain the following quote in the Report: " Because of the
difficulties encountered in complyin g with the accounting and reporting requirements of the new model,
the County must now be enabled to issue its CAFR for the fiscal year ending November 30, 2002, with
any governmental industry standard of six months following. "
Mr. Knorr stated that the industry standard for issuing financial statements and obtaining a certificate of
compliance is six months. The problem with the implementation of GASB 34 was a realignment of the
reporting of the County from all past historical practices normally considered to be the general fund . The
general fund is divided into governmenta l and business funds, i.e., hospital and health operations. Fixed
assets and infrastructure are brought onto the County 's balance sheet; this was previously not done.
Commissioner Hansen asked whether the County had completed the fixed asset inventory.
Mr. Knorr replied in the affirmative. He further stated that an outside consultant was brought in.
Vice Chairman Goslin asked whether the County is in compliance with GASB 34.
Mr. KnoIT stated that the County is in full compliance.
Vice Chairman Goslin stated that many counties are struggling with compliance regarding all aspects of
GASB 34.
Mr. Knorr stated that it had been difficult for many older municipalities to obtain information regarding
compliance.
Commissioner Hansen asked whether there was a short statement the County could issue regarding how
depreciation is treated in GASB 34, and the different types of materials functioning across different types
of depreciation.
Mr. Knorr stated that the report addressed fixed assets in very much the same way that it is done m
private practice. He further stated that the County had established policies regarding its capital assets.
Commissioner Hansen requested that Mr. KnoIT comment on the quarterly reconciliation reports.
Mr. Knorr stated that he tried to simplify the cash reconciliation for the County. He further stated that he
would like to take the format and start conducting a quarterly review by the third quarter.
Commissioner Hansen asked whether the manager-review procedures were in place.
Mr. KnoIT replied in the affirmative. He further stated that the responsibility is in the Comptro ller' s
Office.
Commissioner Hansen requested that Mr. Knorr explain the process of tracking and recording retirements
of capital assets.

1670

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 17, 2005

Mr. Knorr stated that a document goes to specific departments. He further stated that the procedure
requests that the identity of the disposal or retirement of any assets that should be taken off the books be
explained.
Commissioner Hansen asked whether the County possessed the personnel needed to account for capital
assets.
Mr. Knorr replied in the affirmative. He further stated that there was a County manual on capital asset
policy. Additionally, he stated that the County was leasing a major systems installation.
Commissioner Hansen inquired what future safeguards were in place to prevent financial deficiencies,
specifically regarding the $400,000 in the Adult Probation Department.
James Anderson, Executive Officer, Office of the Chief Judge, stated that the Adult Proba tion
Department operated two bank accounts that were reviewed monthly. The banks report back to the
Department and watch the value of the Department's co llateral relative to the cash flow.
Commissioner Hansen asked how this financial deficiency occurred.
Mr. Anderson stated that the collateral values fluctuated with the market.
Commissioner Hansen asked what was meant by "dollar-level amo unt."
Mr. Knorr stated that he requested all the accountants in the C omptroller's Office to submit substantial
journal entries for his review.
Commissioner Hansen asked whether the Bureau of Finance hired an accountant responsible for handling
the grants of the County.
Mr. Knorr responded that the Bureau had hired Steve Whiter in the fall of 2004.
Commissioner Hansen inquired as to the status of the information technology infrastructure.
Catherine Maras O'Leary, C hief Information Officer, Bureau of Information Technology and
Automation, stated that her Bureau had progressed and that the Bureau is working diligently on the issue.
She further stated that the target date is the second quarter of 2006.
Commissioner Han sen asked how one should access disaster-recovery infonnation.
Mrs. Maras O ' Leary replied that the County had a state-of-the-art p latform and that the Department had a
process called Geographica l Disperse Parallel Sysplex; this process allows her Department to take
pictures of the state-of-the-art enterprise server and display these pictures on an hourly basis, as opposed
to being down a day.
Commissioner Hansen asked whether the County was on target with plans for renovation and a new
accounting package for the County Clerk's Office.
Fredda Berman, Director of Tax Services, County Clerk 's Office, stated that the County C lerk 's Office
will come before the Board on May 17, 2005 for contract approval of the cashiering system. The County
C lerk 's Office will be able to implement the recommendation at that time. Construction will begin in the
fall ; and completion will be in April 2006.

1671

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 17, 2005

Commi ssioner Hansen inquired regarding the status of accounts in compliance with the Taxpayers'
Interest A ssurance Ordinance in providing a more reasonable service charge.
Kevin Givens, Director, Department of Environmenta l Control , stated that in February 2005 the
Department of Environmental Control was able to revise the structure with Bank One. Currently they
receive credits and a reduced fee for transactions. The issue at hand on the Audit Report had been
rectified.
Commissioner Hansen asked which department was in charge of the Taxpayers ' Interest Assurance
Ordinance.
Laura Burman, County Auditor, replied that the reason the Department of Environmental Control was
subject to the Taxpayers' Interest Assurance Ordinance was because the Department maintained its own
bank account.
Commissioner Hansen asked why the County MIS Department could not support and maintain the
Coun ty's Recorder's accounting system.
Darlena Williams-Burnett, Chief Deputy Recorder, Recorder of Deeds, stated that the Office was still in
the process of purchasing modules that would allow the Recorder's Office to interface with the cas hiering
system. The Department had the hardware installed and brought an employee from J.D. Edwards to
configure it. The system was very cumbersome. Another J.D. Edwards employee reconfigured the
program and stayed several weeks. It cost over $30,000 for both J.D. Edwards employees. The J.D.
Edwards modules didn ' t work for the Office because it possessed too many components.
Commissioner Hansen stated that the Commi ssioners did not adopt the Treas urer's investment po licy; he
inquired what the Commissioners ' intent should be.
Patrick T. Dri scoll , Jr., Deputy State's Attorney, C hief, C ivil Actions Bureau, State's Attorney's Office,
responded that the Board can compel the Treasurer's Office to submit a policy to the Board but that the
Board cannot micro-manage the policy. He furth er stated that the Board cannot require the Treasurer's
Office to obta in Board approval of the Treasurer' s policy.

Commissioner Butler, seconded by Commissioner Hansen, moved to receive and file Item No. 2
(Communication No. 268944). The motion carried.

Dr. Winship requested that Michael Sommers, Chief Information Officer, Bureau of Health Services start
the presentation.
Mr. Sommers stated the following: The Cerner System is a collection of many programs installed on
various machines. The Bureau ' s goal is to make the Cerner System user friendly so that when you hit the

Commissioner Suffredin asked if Cerner Corporation interacts with the Foster Group.
Mr. Hately replied that Cerner Corporation does not interact with the Foster Group.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 17, 2005

Reason:

This request is necessary to allow sufficient time for the issuance of a Request for
Proposal for a group purchasing organization and to issue a bid for
pharmaceutical wholesaler/distributor.
The expiration date of the current
contracts is June 30, 2005.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $29,000,000.00 ($1 ,800,000.00 $2,260,000.00 - (240-36 1 and 240364 Accounts); $4,644,000.00 $5,200,000.00 - (891-361 aRd 891 364 Accounts);

$17,190,000.00 - (897-361 and 897-364 Accounts); and $5,040,000.00 $4. 100,000.00 - (898361 and 898-364 Accounts)]. Contract extension: July 1, 2005 through October 31 , 2005.

Note: T his item was also referred to the Committee on Finance. (See Comm. No.
270966).
*Referred to the Health and Hospitals Committee on 05/03/05.
Chairman Butler stated that the Health and Hospitals Committee will stand in recess until the call of the
Chair, so that Chairman Daley can call the Finance Committee meeting to order.
Commissioner Peraica asked Daniel H. Winship, M.D. , Chief, Bureau of Health Services, to prov ide
additional background infonnation regarding the contract.
Dr. Winship stated the following: in December of 2004 the Bureau of Health Services began developing
the plan for the pharmaceutical contract and the RFP. This group was formed last month ; it is comprised
of several divisions from the Bureau of Health Services and the State' s Attorney's Office. The McKesson
Corporation contract terminates on June 30, 2005; the Bureau of Health Services expects to have
sufficient time to develop the contract. A goal of the contract is to obtain pharmaceutical supplies less
expensively by opening up the bidding process. Additionally, by separating out the various contract
components, the Bureau will be able to obtain a better price for the next three years.
Dr. Winship requested that the head of the team, Dan Martin, Deputy Chief, Bureau of Health Services,
further answer Commissioner Pera ica' s question.
President Stroger stated the fo llowing: the concept originated with Ruth Rothstein, former Chief, Bureau
of Health Services. Mr. Martin has been w ith the Bureau of Health Services since the beginning of the
concept and Mr. Martin has been involved in every aspect of the healthcare delivery system. Mr. Martin
was the fom1er Chief Operating Officer of Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County and he initiated the
program that was developed by Ms. Rothstein.
Commissioner Maldonado requested that Mr. Martin address the Committee to explain the difference
between the Group Purchasing Organization and the Pharmaceutica l Prime Vendor Wholesale/Distributor
functions. Commissioner Maldonado inquired also why it is important to separate these function s.
Commissioner Suffredin asked whether the four-month extens ion is adequate and whether McKesson is
agreeable to the four-month time frame.
Mr. Martin replied that the four-month extension is sufficient; McKesson has agreed to this extension as
has the Purchasing A lliance for C linical Therapeutics (PACT). Mr. Martin further stated that this Group
Purchasing Organization has a separa te contrac t under the McKesson umbrella.

1680

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 17, 2005

Commissioner Suffredin asked whether the 340B purchasing would fall under a different category. He
next inquired if the County is able to enter into the 340B agreement before the four-month extension is
completed, whether McKesson will hold the County liable for any lost sales.
Mr. Martin replied that all purchases of pharmaceuticals are conducted by McKesson. If the 340B Prime
Vendor Program is approved by the County; then the pricing structure would automatically flow into the
current McKesson contract.
Commissioner Peraica asked when the 340B program was initiated.
Mr. Martin replied that the program was initiated two years ago. The 340B Prime Vendor Program was a
result of recent changes in Federal regulations. Within the last year the Federal Government has altered
the program to allow more individuals to participate.
Commissioner Peraica asked whether the County participated in the price discounting programs.
Mr. Martin replied that the County has participated in the price discounting programs for many years with
the exception of Cennak Health Services of Cook County which is not designated as a disproportion
shared hospital.
Commissioner Daley stated that he would like to enter into the record a memo from the Bureau of Health
Services which amends several account numbers and amounts. (The referenced document is on file in the
Office of the County C lerk.)
Chairman Butler asked Alvin Ho lley, Chief Financial Officer, Bureau of Health Services, to read the
amendment into the record.
Mr. Holley read the amendments into the record as fo llows: Fiscal Impact: $29,000,000.00,
$1 ,800,000.00 $2,260,000.00 - Cermak Health Services of Cook County (240-361 and 240-364
Accounts); $4,044 ,000.00 $5,200,000.00 - Prov ident Hospital of Cook County (891-36 1 aAd 891 304

BUREAU OF HEALTH SERVICES, by Daniel H. Winship, M.D., Chief, transmitti ng a
Communication, dated April 12, 2005:
On June 30, 2005, Contract No. 02-43-960, Pharmaceutical Purchasing Program with
McKesson Corporation, and Con tract No. 02-43-961 , Group Purchasing Organization with
Purchasing Alliance for C linica l Therapeutics (PACT), are scheduled to expire.
Together, these two contracts comprise what is known as the Bureau of Health Services
Pharmacy Prime Vendor Program. This program has been in effect for the past three years
and has proven to be successful in terms of consistently providing pharmaceutical products
required for the care of our patients and enabling the County to lower its costs and improve
the management of its pharmaceutical services.

1681

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 17, 2005

In preparation for the expiration of these contracts, representatives from the offices of the
Purchasing Agent, Contract Compliance, State's Attorney and the Bureau of Health Services
have been meeting to review the program and to develop plans and recommendations to
allow for the continuation of the program. As a result of these meetings, the Bureau of
Health Services submits the following recommendations:
7. separate the procurements of a group purchasing organization and a pharmaceutical
prime vendor (wholesale/distributor) for the next contract cycle, in order to provide a
greater opportunity for competition among prospective contractors and thereby
achieve potential additional cost savings;
8.

separate the procurement of a contract for medical assistance program services from
the procurement of a prime vendor in order to limit the deliverables under the prime
vendor contract;

9.

issue a request for proposals for a group purchasing organization;

I 0. issue an advertisement for bids for a prime vendor (wholesaler/distributor) ;
I I. issue an advertisement for bids for medical assistance program services; and
12. enter into an agreement for the Bureau of Health Services to participate in the new
Federa l 340 Prime Vendor Program in order to obtain even deeper discounts on
purchases eligible for this program.
In order to implement these recommendations, I am requesting authorization for the
following actions:
5. To issue a Request for Proposals for group purchasing organization services.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: None. Contract period:
October 3 1, 2008. Requisition No. 58900601.

This item was also referred to the Committee on Finance. (See Comm. No.
270973).

*Referred to the Health and Hospitals Committee on 05/03/05.
Commissioner Hansen asked whether this contract represents an unfair bias for McKesson.
Mr. Martin stated that four years ago the Bureau of Health Services issued an RFP in an effort to reduce
pharmaceutical expenditures for the coming year. Many of the healthcare organizations participate in
either a Prime Vendor or a Group Purchasing Organization. Most organizations either belong to a Group
Purchasing Organization or work with a wholesale distributor which delivers products directly and keeps
any inventory; payment is made directly to the wholesale distributor. A Group Purchasing Organization
negotiates pricing for pharmaceutical and medical supplies on behalf of its members. This organization is
able to leverage greater purchasing power.
Mr. Martin continued that the County issued the RFP to save money and to detennine which programs
would benefit the County. Five or six vendors replied to the RFP; McKesson submitted a particularly
comprehensive program: They offered a group purchas ing organization, a wholesaler distributor function
and a medication assistant program. Additionally, McKesson seeks reimbursement on behalf of its
members for various drug-manufacturer programs. Such reimbursement recovers product that has been
dispensed to indigent patients. Family size and income are evaluated to determine whether a patient
qualifies for indigent status.
Mr. Martin stated that at the time the contract was awarded, Cook County had numerous pharmaceutical
contracts in place. The County allowed the contracts to expire and then rolled them into the Prime
Vendor Program.
Mr. Martin continued that only a few Group Purchasing Organizations possess both a wholesaler and a
medication assistance program; this limits the number of RFP responses. There exist three prices that the
County could pay for the drugs from McKesson: the negotiated Group Purchasing Organization price;
the price McKesson would pay were they purchasing independently from the manufacturer, which is
termed the " Average Wholesale Acquisition Cost"; or the 340B Program price. If the drug is for inpatient
use or for a facility that is not designated as a disproportion share hospital facility, the Bureau would then
purchase the drugs through a Group Purchasing Organization, which can negotiate a price better than the
Average Wholesale Price.
Commissioner Hansen asked whether the County can buy drugs directly from, for example, Abbott
Laboratories.
Mr. Martin replied in the negative; they will not sell directly to the County.
Commissioner Maldonado stated that because the County is part of the Federal 340B Prime Vendor
Program, the County is guaranteed the lowest possible price for pharmaceuticals.

1683

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 17, 2005

Mr. Martin stated that the 340B drug program contains a pricing schedule and ceilings set by the Federal
Government. Under Federal regulations no one can pay less then the VA system price; this price is the
lowest that is sold to the Federal Government. The differe nce between the 340B's ceiling price and the
VA ' s price ranges between seven and eleven percent; this price difference could yield the County cost
sav ings. The Federa l Governmenf s Group Purchasing Organization is organized to achieve a 340B price
which is between the VA price and the ceiling price.
Commissioner Maldonado asked whether the County could competitively bid fo r a contract with a Group
Purchasing Organization.
Mr. Martin replied that there is no dollar value assigned to a Group Purchasing Organization contract.
This makes it difficult to evaluate cost; one is not purchasing directl y from a Group Purchasing
Organization but is joining an organization that will extend favorab le pricing. The actua l dollar
expenditures are agreed upon by the wholesaler and the County.
Commissioner Maldonado inquired whether the County pays a Group Purchasing Organization joining
fee.
Mr. Martin replied that some Group Purchasing Organizations have a nominal j o ining fee of $300 to
$400.
Commissioner Quigley inquired how the County is pursuing this agreement differently compared to the
way the County sought an agreement with McKesson.
Mr. M artin replied that the last time the County issued an RFP, the County notified various potential
Group Purchas ing Organizations and pharmaceutica l wholesalers. Presently the County is seeking to
replicate all aspects of the contracts. The RFP will be publicly advertised on the County webs ite and
through other venues.
Commissioner Quigley inquired how the County wi ll determine the best competitive prices on
pharmaceuticals.
Mr. M artin replied that on the Group Purchasing Organization side, the County will include in the RFP a
list of the types of drugs purchased for FY 2004 and the quantities, and then the Group Purchasing
Organizations can compare their drug list with the Coun ty" s and form ulate pricing. As a result of the RFP
process, the County wi ll compare the cost of purchases from various Group Purchasing Organizations.
Finally the County would consider the term of the contract before choosing a Group Purchasing
Organization contract.
Commissioner Silvestri inquired whether there has been any consideration of how contracting with
multiple companies impacts cost savings and service.
Mr. Ma rtin replied that if an organization belongs to a Group Purchasing Organization, the determined
prices are provided to the wholesaler which that organization selects. The wholesaler would honor these
prices.
Commissioner Silvestri asked who enters the prices into the database.
Mr. Martin replied that the wholesa ler/distributor enters the prices.

1684

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 17, 2005

Commissioner Collins asked how many County contracts currently supply pharmaceuticals to the Bureau
of Health Services.
Mr. Martin replied there is currently one pharmaceutical contract which is with McKesson.
Commissioner Collins asked whether Cook County assumed the responsibility for distribution and for the
Group Purchasing Organization.
Mr. Martin replied that the Group Purchasing Organization distributes and negotiates prices.

Commissioner Steele, seconded by Commissioner Hansen, moved the approval of Communication
No. 270974. The motion carried.
Commissioner Silvestri moved to adjourn the meeting, seconded by Commissioner Peraica. The
motion carried and the meeting was adjourned.

Transmitting a Communication, dated May 12, 2005 from
THOMAS J. GLASER, Chief Financial Officer
I am transmitting for your approval an Ordinance authorizing and directing the waiver and relinquishment
of any and all right, title or interest in and to the land and facilities of Roseland Community Hospital
Associate and the refusal of tender by warranty deed of Roseland's Faci Ii ties to the County of Cook by or
on behalf of Roseland.
In 1978, Cook County served as a conduit issuer for Roseland to access the tax-exempt bond market. Per
Internal Revenue Service regulations at the time, in order for the bonds to be exempt from federal
taxation, the County must receive full , unencumbered title to the hospital property when the bonds were
redeemed or defeased. Given the County's current extensive health care delivery system, and the
Hospital 's desire to continue its independent operations, this Ordinance refuses the tendered title to the
Hospital property without jeopardizing the tax-exempt status of the bonds. Please note that this request is
similar to what the County has done in other instances.
