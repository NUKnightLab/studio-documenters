Summary: The Forest Preserves would like to extend the aforementioned Intergovernmental Agreement
(“IGA”) with the Village of Palatine for ten (10) years. This IGA grants the Village of Palatine limited
access to Forest Preserve property for the purpose of establishing and maintaining a vegetative buffer
between the Forest Preserves and residential homes at the northeast portion of Deer Grove East,
immediately south of Brentwood Drive and east of Westwood Lane. The proposed work will not be
conducted beyond fifty (50) yards of the Forest Preserves’ property line, and will be maintained at no cost
to the Forest Preserves. The Village of Palatine will be responsible for all mowing and vegetation
reduction in the area adjacent to homeowner properties annually, following the Forest Preserves’ approval
of an annual work plan.
This maintenance mitigates growth and excessive height of invasive vegetation directly abutting residential
properties. The Village of Palatine has been conducting such vegetation maintenance activities under the
existing IGA since 2013 at no cost to the Forest Preserves.

During the mid-1980’s, Forest Preserves staff undertook a comprehensive study of all Forest Preserves
holdings, resulting in a list of 30 parcels being considered for disposal. Subsequently, the Forest Preserves
sought and obtained permission, on 9/23/1985 via Public Act 84-867, from the State Legislature to offer 27
of the 30 aforementioned parcels for sale with the monies to accrue to the Forest Preserves Real Estate
Acquisition Fund. On 8/16/2001, via Public Act 92-0403, the State Legislature authorized the sale of an
additional 5 surplus parcels including the Surplus Parcel.
The adjacent property owner, 5035 N. River Road, LLC (the “Buyer”), has agreed to buy the Surplus
Parcel from the Forest Preserves for the sum of NINETY-THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND 00/100
($93,000.00). The purchase price is consistent with M.A.I. certified appraisals obtained by the Forest
Preserves.
Permission is now sought, upon satisfactory completion of all due diligence and negotiation of any and all
required documentation as determined by the Forest Preserves’ legal department, to accept the
aforementioned purchase price, less any customary closing costs, as full compensation for the sale of the
Surplus Parcel and to convey by quitclaim deed all of the Forest Preserves’ right, title and interest in the
Surplus Parcel.
