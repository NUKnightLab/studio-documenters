PROPOSED RESOLUTION
REQUESTING TO PRESENT AN ADVISORY PUBLIC QUESTION VIA A COUNTYWIDE
REFERENDUM TO COOK COUNTY VOTERS ON WHETHER THE STATE OF ILLINOIS
SHOULD LEGALIZE, REGULATE AND TAX RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA USE FOR
ADULTS 21 AND OVER
WHEREAS, Pursuant to the Illinois Election Code, 10 ILCS 5/28-1, et seq., and the Counties Code, 55
ILCS 5/5-1005.5, the corporate authorities of a county have the authority to submit a public question to the
electors of the county by means of a referendum; and
WHEREAS, despite spending more than $1 Trillion over the last 40 years, the efforts of the “War on
Drugs”, the health and social costs of drugs increase every year, drugs are no less available than before,
and treatment is not available to the vast majority of people who need it; and
WHEREAS, existing evidence from other states and countries show there
decriminalization or legalization of marijuana leads to a measurable increase in its use; and

is

no

indication

that

WHEREAS, eight states and Washington D.C. have already legalized the recreational use of marijuana;
and
WHEREAS, marijuana-related arrests in every Cook County municipality, including Chicago, result in
staggering costs to Cook County government by virtue of the necessary involvement of the County jail,
Sheriff’s department, State’s Attorney, Clerk of the Court, judiciary, and often times, the Public Defender,
annually costing Cook County taxpayers tens of millions of dollars; and
WHEREAS, most arrests for marijuana possession do not lead to trials or prison terms. Instead, a large
number of these arrests are plea-bargained, continued without a finding, dismissed, or otherwise handled in
a manner that places unnecessary burdens on already-limited criminal justice system resources; and
WHEREAS, as Illinois and Cook County continually face severe budget and financial constraints and
lawmakers repeatedly face the undesirable choice of deciding between increasing taxes or substantial
service cuts, or both, creating an intelligent, practical framework of cannabis legalization, regulation and
taxation can help address a myriad of problems such as improved health and public safety, reduced
criminal justice and jail costs, law enforcement efficacy, black market drug displacement as well as
increased revenue for education and treatment protocols; and

WHEREAS, legalizing, regulating and taxing recreational marijuana use for adults 21 and over and would
have an estimated revenue impact of $350 to $699 million at the state level and would also have a positive
multi-million dollar impact for Cook County via sales tax proceeds and other public and private revenue
streams; and
WHEREAS, a recent 2017 Gallup poll has shown that 64% of Americans are in favor of legalizing
marijuana; and
WHEREAS, a recent 2017 poll conducted by the Paul Simon Public Policy Institute finds that two-thirds
of Illinois voters, support or strongly support legalization of recreational marijuana if it is taxed and
regulated like alcohol, and in Chicago, 74 percent of voters support or strongly support legalization of
marijuana while in suburban Cook and the collar counties support or strong support is at 70 percent; and
WHEREAS, 55 ILCS 5/5-1005.5 states, “By a vote of the majority of the members of the county board,
the board may authorize an advisory question of public policy to be placed on the ballot at the next
regularly scheduled election in the county.”; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners seeks to place an advisory public question before
the electorate via a referendum on the March 20, 2018, countywide ballot seeking to ask Cook County
residents if they are in favor of legalizing, regulating and taxing recreational marijuana use for adults 21
and over in Illinois, as follows:

marijuana and marijuana products for recreational use by adults 21 and older subject to state
regulation, taxation and local ordinance?"
[ ] Yes

Whereas, based on Clerk of the Circuit Court for Cook County data for 2016 and 2017, there has been a
47.8% decline in new court cases over the last 10 years across all case types. More specifically, there has
been a 35.4% decline in civil cases, a 56.8% decline in criminal cases, and a 49.5% decline in traffic
cases; and
WHEREAS, this continued decline in case volume suggests that the Circuit Court of Cook County’s 333
courtrooms, originally built to handle the large case volume of the 1970s and 1980s, may currently have
excess capacity; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Circuit Court Branch Court locations are in some of the poorest physical

presiding officer’s order, the presiding officer may direct the removal of the individual from the
meeting.
Unless otherwise ordered by the presiding officer, any individual ordered to be
removed from a meeting is excluded from returning to that meeting, unless the decision of the
presiding officer is overruled by a majority vote of those members in attendance. Any two
members may place before the body the question of whether to permit the individual to return
to the same meeting.

members and mail the notice to the individual's last known address, if any. The notice is

The exclusion order shall remain posted on the door to the
chambers for the duration of the exclusion period.
(5) In determining the scope and length of an individual's exclusion allowed under subsection (i) of

orderly conduct of the meeting, the number of disruptions in which the individual participated
and other reasons deemed relevant by the President.

PROPOSED TRANSFER OF FUNDS

Request: Transfer of Funds

Page 22 of 83

 Board of Commissioners

BOARD AGENDA

November 15, 2017

Reason: Additional postage dollars will fund the last month of Home Rule Tax Compliance Notices for
FY 2017 and the Sweetened Beverage Tax (SBT) repeal notification to registered taxpayers.
From Account(s): 1007.520825, $25,000.00
To Account(s): 1007.520260, $25,000.00
Total Amount of Transfer: $25,000.00
On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of
funds in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date,
and what was the balance 30 days prior to that date?

It became apparent Oct 10th, after SBT Repeal, that the receiving account would require an infusion of
funds for Q4 to continue with the Home Rule Tax Compliance mailings. At that time, the balance in the
account was $18,000.00, and was at this level 30 days prior.
How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified?
accounts that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.

List any other

The departments will repurpose unused funds that were initially set aside for temporary staffing service in
the first year of SBT implementation. The funds will be transferred from the professional service account,
as these funds are no longer required.
Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result
in the account that funds are transferred from.

None
If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was
originally budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in
the fiscal year.

Originally, the department appropriated funds for temporary staffing to assist with 2017 first year
implementation of the SBT. Those funds are no longer required as services have been terminated.

The Chief Procurement Officer concurs.
Summary: The Office of the Chief Judge, Circuit Court of Cook County (OCJ) requests a new, one-year
contract with Northwestern University to clinically staff and manage mental health services for
court-involved youth in Cook County. The contract is designed to avoid a lapse in mental health services
during the interim period that a Request for Proposals (RFP) for fully integrated mental health services is
completed and a new vendor is selected. The interim contract would replace the two separate, current
contracts with (1) The Isaac Ray Center, Inc., which expires 11/30/2017; and, (2) Northwestern
University, which expires 12/31/2017. The Isaac Ray Center provides clinical mental health services at the
Juvenile Temporary Detention Center (JTDC) under contract number 10-41-68; and Northwestern
University currently manages the Cook County Juvenile Court Clinic under contract 10-41-14.

In the spring of 2015, as part of the transition process from federal oversight of the JTDC, Chief Judge
Timothy Evans appointed The Circuit Court of Cook County Committee on the Transition of the Juvenile

BOARD AGENDA

November 15, 2017

Temporary Detention Center (“The Committee”). The Committee included expert-led subcommittees that
were designed to make recommendations for system improvements concerning youth-serving
departments. The Committee concluded, “Positive outcomes and future opportunities for youth” should not
only be the operational focus for the JTDC, but should also be the focus of all youth-serving departments.
In addition, the Health/Mental Health Care sub-committee recommended that the Chief Judge commission
a study of the feasibility of consolidating the mental health services currently offered by the JTDC, the
Juvenile Probation and Court Services Department (Probation), and the Juvenile Court Clinic.
In response, Chief Judge Evans asked the Chapin Hall Center for Children at the University of Chicago
(Chapin Hall) to conduct an independent review of relevant mental health screening, assessment, referral,
and service delivery practices, and make recommendations to help achieve an integrated system of mental
health for youth involved with the Juvenile Justice Division of the Cook County Circuit Court. Specific
deliverables included recommendations for addressing problem areas based on a comprehensive review of
how current mental health screening, assessment, referral processes and relevant clinical interventions
function in comparison to evidence from existing literature about best practices. As a result of the Chapin
Hall review, the OCJ has been working to develop a RFP that establishes and implements fully integrated
mental health services across the court services continuum. This contract would provide time required to
complete the procurement process.
This is a sole source contract pursuant to Section 34-139 of the Cook County Procurement Code. ..end

Total Amount of Transfer: $100,000
On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of
funds in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date,
and what was the balance 30 days prior to that date?

In August 2017, after the court received notice of the change in transcript rates, it became apparent that
the court reporter transcripts account would require an infusion of funds in order to meet current
obligations. The remaining account balance in late October was $15,571; 30 days prior to that date, the
remaining balance in the account was $51,363.
In late October 2017, it became apparent that the modest travel accounts for Department 310, the Office
of the Chief Judge and Department 300, the Judiciary, would require and infusion of funds in order to meet
current obligations. The balances in the accounts then, as well as the month prior were zero.
In late October 2017, it became apparent that the office supplies account for the Office of the Chief
Judge, Department. 310 would require an infusion of funds in order to meet current obligations. The
remaining account balance then on was $8,014 and 30 days prior to that date, the balance was $9,015.
How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified?
accounts that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.

List any other

The account proposed as the source of funds for the Court Reporter Transcript account is the Judiciary’s
account for books and periodicals. This account was identified as having sufficient funds to meet any
pending obligations for the remainder of the year. No other accounts were considered as a source of the
transferred funds.
The account proposed as the source of funds for the travel and office supplies accounts is the food for
jurors. Late in the year, in order to meet the county’s budget mandates, the court eliminated breakfast and
snacks for jurors. As such, this account was identified as having sufficient funds to meet any pending
obligations for the remainder of year. No other accounts were considered as a source of the transferred
funds.
Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result
in the account that funds are transferred from.

A moratorium has been placed on the books that can be ordered for the remainder of this fiscal year.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was
originally budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in
the fiscal year.

BOARD AGENDA

November 15, 2017

The transfer of funds will not cause a reduction in services from the 1110.1310.10210.520210 account.
Due to a recent effort to reduce costs, breakfasts and snack meals have been eliminated from juror food
in August 2017. This reduction in service will allow for the transfer of funds without negatively impacting
service.

PROPOSED GRANT AWARD
Department: Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office
Grantee: Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office
Grantor: U.S. Department of Justice
Request: Authorization to accept grant
Purpose: State and local law enforcement agencies receive equitable sharing funds by participating jointly

with Department of Justice agencies on investigations that lead to the seizure and forfeiture of property.
Once an investigation is completed and the seized assets are forfeited, the assisting state and local law
enforcement agencies can request a share of the forfeited assets or a percentage of the proceeds derived
from the sale of forfeited assets. Generally, the degree of a state or local agency’s direct participation in
an investigation determines the amount or percentage of funds shared with the agency. Before requesting
a share of the seized assets, a state or local law enforcement agency must first become a member of the
DOJ Equitable Sharing Program. To participate in the program, agencies sign and submit to DOJ an
equitable sharing agreement and certification form. The agreement must be renewed annually, and by
signing and submitting the agreement, the officials of participating agencies certify that they will use
equitable sharing funds for law enforcement purposes.
Grant Amount: TBD
Grant Period: 12/1/2017 - 11/30/2020
