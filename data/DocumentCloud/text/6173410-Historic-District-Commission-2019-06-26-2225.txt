PROPOSAL
2225 Wabash is an irregularly shaped vacant parcel immediately north of a similar irregularly-shaped parcel at 2221
Wabash. Both parcels were originally one lot and later split. The property is located between Michigan Avenue and
Dalzelle Street on the west side of the block. The applicant is proposing the construction of a two-family home on
this parcel, per the appended drawings and specifications.
The applicant is seeking the Commission’s approval for the following scope:
New Construction of a two-family flat to include:
• 2x6 wood construction with R-38 in ceiling and R-19 in walls and new Tyvek house wrap
• Standing seam metal roof
• Windows: Pella wood clad double hung windows
• Install Brick and ship lap siding
• Gutters and down spouts
• Install masonry planter boxes as part of building design with vertical growing wall panels
• Second floor unit with front entry and side balcony.

 •
Site:

•

First floor unit to have side entry
New wood fence in rear and sides of property with gates parking area
Install concrete parking pad for two cars
New landscape area and planter beds in front and side of property
Replace sod as required due to construction damage
New concrete walkway from front on house to rear of property

STAFF OBSERVATIONS
In its current configuration, both 2221 and 2225 Wabash appear to be maintained as a single large parcel with no
delineation of the boundary between them. All of 2225 Wabash is currently grass turf or planted beds, as is the front
(street-adjacent) portion of 2221 Wabash. The property appears to be well-maintained and 2221 Wabash appears to
be occupied.

2225 Wabash, current parcel boundaries per City of Detroit Parcel Viewer.

Originally, it appears from Sanborn maps dated 1897 that both parcels were a single parcel with two separate singlefamily dwellings erected thereon; a now demolished larger frame house (originally 289, later 2225) at the street front
(northeast) corner of the lot, and a smaller rear house (originally 287, now 2221) at the rear or alley-adjacent
southwest corner. Two adjoining frame garages, presumably one for each home, are no longer extant.

Red arrow indicates site of proposed new construction.

Given the patterns of development in this vicinity, it is likely that 2225 Wabash was similar in style and features to
the still existing historic homes flanking the subject property and sharing its former setback line. By 1921, the
original single-family dwelling had been converted to a two-family flat, as were many other nearby properties on
Wabash (noted by F instead of D on the Sanborn map). Architecturally, such single-family to duplex conversions
often saw modifications for additional exterior door openings and modified or additional porches. Such densities
were maintained through the mid-century period until decline and urban renewal started to deplete the area’s
population.

at the rear remains a single-family dwelling. Note another two-family flat has
been inserted immediately to the north of 2225. This is 2231-33 Wabash, currently extant.

Upon designation as a historic district in late 1984, it is likely that only 2221 Wabash was still extant, per the
designation slides below. However, conflicting city records indicate that 2225 Wabash may have been demolished as
late as 1997. Records indicate that the two-family flat at 2225 Wabash was vacant and boarded for some time before
demolition. HDC staff has no record of previous COA applications for either of these properties.

slide was taken for the vacant lot itself. Both of the photographed buildings originally shared a single parcel, similar to the
subject property, illustrating the historic density of the block.

The proposed new construction is a two-family flat rising 2½ stories in a contemporary design, which infills the
location formerly occupied by the historic two-family flat demolished prior to the establishment of the district. The
proposed height is consistent with nearby properties. The proposed building is approximately 24’ wide. The south
portion is recessed, which the applicant argues gives the remaining portion of the façade the appearance that it is
taller than it is wide, emphasizing verticality typical of the district. Windows are proposed to be wood casement;
individual units are taller than wide, which are grouped together to form large areas of glazing with openings taking
up approximately 20% of the façade. Individual windows and groups of windows are regular and ordered, and
placed directly above each other from the first to the second floor.
The building’s proposed setback is generally aligned with the setback of nearby historic homes and is also generally
aligned with the setback of the original structure once occupying the site. Similarly consistent is the treatment of
porches, which occur assymetrically per many other examples in the district.
The materiality of the structure is different than many of the historic examples nearby, with the elevations employing
wood ship-lap siding, metal trim, accent panels, and brick. The applicant states that “the main material concept is to
create hierarchy and order by using the different materials to define zones that nest inside each other.” The majority
of the front façade is clad in vertically oriented wood ship-lap siding; within this field is nested horizontally-oriented
wood ship-lap siding and windows, with metal panel introduced where a group of windows wraps the corner. Brick
is used most prominently at the south-east corner for the full two-story height of the stair volume, in addition to
proposed planter boxes and brick porch elements. A neutral color palette has been proposed, with stained wood shiplap siding as an accent to create visual interest.
The overall architectural detailing is simple, which the applicant intends to complement the existing houses on the
block. In order to match the level of detail and visual interest found in the existing homes, the applicant is proposing
a concept of layering and texture which is used to create depth and hierarchy in the facades. Absent traditional

 ornament, the applicant suggests that this layering of materials, along with the projected porch, planters, and roof
overhangs will create dynamic and interesting shadow lines on the façade. Staff concurs that this design approach is
likely to add visual and architectural interest respectful of its context, without the often inappropriate use of
ornament or conjecture, and that this approach appears consistent with the district’s Elements of Design, including
elements of scale, directional expression, and degree of complexity in the façade.
As per the proposal’s compatibility with the district’s general character, the applicant argues for the design’s
compatibility with Corktown’s modestly-detailed, small scale homes, dense urban character, and mix of architectural
styles; all of which are attentive to scale, proportion, and quality. The proposed new construction does exhibit
quality contemporary materials and appears to be designed thoughtfully in response to its rich urban context. Staff
does note for the Commission the considerable use of brick, which is not particularly common among the modest
wood-framed homes predominating in the district despite its availability during the historic period. There are some
brick residential structures in the district, and the Elements of Design do note that these are typically duplex or
multi-family dwellings, as is the proposed building. There appear to be little historic precedent for brick planter
boxes and metal mesh growing walls, though current day Corktown is rich with front yard gardens and perennial
borders which are not at odds with the historic setting.

ELEMENTS OF DESIGN
The applicant has provided a narrative (appended to this report) addressing how the proposed work complies with
the district’s elements of design.
(1) Height. Most residential buildings in the district range from one (1) story to two and one-half (2½) stories
tall. However, an apartment building on Porter Street and a multi-unit building on Fourteenth Street are
comprised of four (4) stories each. Commercial and industrial buildings range in height from one (1) to five (5)
stories tall; the Victorian commercial buildings are between two (2) and three (3) stories tall. Institutional
buildings range from one (1) to three (3) stories.
(2) Proportion of buildings' front facades. Proportion varies in the district, depending on the age, style and type
of building. One-story workers' cottages are slightly wider than tall to the peak of the gable; two-story pre-1880's
residential buildings are generally taller than wide. Side-by-side duplexes are either wider than tall or square in
proportion; terraces or attached rowhouses, when grouped together, are substantially wider than tall, although
the individual units may appear taller than wide. Queen Anne style residences are generally slightly wider than
tall or as tall as wide to the eaves of their roofs. The church buildings in the district are taller than wide, and
other institutional buildings are generally wider than tall. Victorian commercial buildings are generally taller
than wide, while newer commercial buildings in the district may be wider than tall. Multi-story industrial
buildings in the district are usually taller than wide, while one (1) or (2) story industrial buildings are wider than
tall. The fire station on Bagley Street at Sixth Street is wider than tall.
(3) Proportion of openings within the facades. Window openings are usually taller than wide, but there are also
square openings and transom window openings which are wider than tall. Several windows are sometimes
grouped into a wider than tall combination. Window openings are almost always subdivided, the double-hung

 sash is the most common window type. Its sashes are generally further divided by muntins, resulting in lights
arranged two-over-two, four-over-four, or six-over-six. There is a great variety of sizes and shapes of window
openings in the Queen Anne style buildings, while there is a more regular arrangement in the earlier pre-1880's
buildings. Facades have approximately five (5) percent to seventy-five (75) percent of their area glazed;
residential buildings generally fall into the thirty (30) to thirty-five (35) percent range.
(4) Rhythm of solids to voids in front facades. Pre-1880's buildings in the Italianate and Greek Revival styles
display a great regularity in the rhythm of solids to voids, with one (1) opening placed directly above the other.
The post-1880's Queen Anne style buildings exhibit a greater freedom, with their bay windows and combinations
of windows in gables.
(5) Rhythm of spacing of buildings on streets. The original pattern of spacing of buildings on streets was that of
houses placed very close together. Most houses were situated on twenty-five (25) foot lots, the major exceptions
being the Lognon Farm where most lots were thirty-three (33) feet wide and where a house was infrequently
placed on an undivided fifty-foot (50) lot. Houses on narrow lots were usually placed on or closer to a side
property line, providing more space on one side of the building. Rhythm has been interrupted by vacant lots due
to demolition of buildings almost throughout the district.
(6) Rhythm of entrance and/or porch projections. Most houses in the district have projecting front porches,
usually on one (1) side of the front facade and sometimes wrapping around to the side, especially on corner lots.
Some Victorian houses have a secondary porch at the side.
(7) Relationships of materials. The great majority of buildings in the district are wood frame structures originally
clad in clapboard with wooden skirting or brick foundations. Some have more recently been sheathed in
aluminum, vinyl or asphalt siding, and original skirting has often been replaced with metal skirting or concrete
block foundations. Window sash and functional and decorative trim are in wood. Wood is frequently the only
material below the eaves of a building, except for the window glass. There are some brick residential buildings
in the district, the majority of these being duplexes and multi-unit dwellings. The small commercial buildings,
the industrial buildings, the fire station, and most of the institutional buildings in the district are brick. Roofing
material is primarily asphalt shingles, although a few wood shingle roofs and one (1) slate roof exist in the
district.
(8) Relationship of textures. The most common relationship of textures in the district is that of clapboard to the
smooth surface of wood trim. Aluminum or vinyl siding of the same width as the original clapboard siding that
does not alter the relationship of the siding to the functional trim and architectural detail of the building can
sometimes contribute to textural relationships. Porches are usually in wood, although some have brick piers.
Steps are either in wood, which was the original material, or concrete. Where wooden shingles, carvings, or
other decorative wooden details exist, they add significantly to the textural interest of the building. Asphalt
shingles or rolled asphalt roofs generally have little textural interest, while wood shingles has considerable
interest. Detailed brickwork on brick buildings contributes to textural interest when it exists.
(9) Relationships of colors. Paint colors in the district generally relate to style. Earlier buildings usually display
muted colors, such as earth tones and shades of yellow, while Italianate and Queen Anne style buildings
sometimes display richer and darker colors, such as browns, golds, grays, and blues. Common trim colors
include; shades of cream, yellow, gray, brown, green, and white. Window sashes are frequently painted white,
deep red, brown and gray. Asphalt siding is either red or brown brick color. Wood shingle roofs are a weathered
cedar tone, while most asphalt shingled roofs are either in light colors, such as sand, light gray, light brown, or
light green, or darker colors, such as dark gray, black, or dark green.
(10) Relationship of architectural details. These generally relate to style, and the styles in Corktown run from
early Victorian to late Victorian and Colonial Revival. The earliest houses in the Greek Revival and Venacular

 styles contain a minimal amount of architectural detail. Functional detail includes the wood cornerboards, wide
cornices with brackets supporting the eaves, and window frames and sills. More ornate details of the Italianate or
Queen Anne styles include paired brackets, window and porch hoods, wooden carvings, sunburst patterns,
fishscale shingles, and verge-boards in gables, and spindlework on balustraded porches. Some buildings,
especially those on Church Street, have leaded glass windows. The late Victorian commercial buildings
sometimes have decorative cornice work, corbeltables, and pediments or parapet walls. In general, Corktown is
rich in its diversity and quality of architectural styles and detail.
(11) Relationship of roof shapes. Pitched roofs with frontal gables predominate in the district, although pitched
roofs with side-facing gables, hip roofs, and hip roofs with intersecting gables also exist. More complex roof
shapes occur primarily on Church Street. Commercial buildings generally have flat roofs. St. Peter's Episcopal
Church has a steeply pitched roof with frontal gables. Rear additions to houses, such as kitchens, frequently have
shed roofs.
(12) Walls of continuity. The major wall of continuity is created by the buildings, with their fairly uniform
setbacks within blocks. Mature and recently planted trees along the tree lawns create a secondary wall of
continuity.
(13) Relationship of significant landscape features and surface treatments. The typical treatment of individual
properties is a shallow flat front lawn area in grass turf, subdivided by a concrete walk leading to the front
entrance and sometimes a concrete walk leading to the side entrance. Short concrete walks from the curbline to
the public sidewalk are also frequent in the district. Foundation plantings and evergreens are typical plantings in
front yards. Hedges are occasionally planted along the side lot lines in the front yards and sometimes along the
front lot line; this treatment usually occurs on corner lots when it exists. Chain link fences predominate as rear
yard enclosures; few continue into the front yards. Wood posts and rails with wire mesh are also common fence
types found in the district, and a few of these fences enclose the front yard as well as the rear. Many rear garages
with alley entrances exist. Concrete side driveways, where they exist interrupt the succession of front yards and
are not the original treatment of the property. The curbs are cut red-brown stone in the majority of the district,
with the primary exceptions of Porter Street, Labrosse Street, Leverette Street, and Michigan Avenue. Alleys in
the district are paved in concrete. Vacant lots are either paved-over or gravelled as parking lots or are unkept.
Light fixtures are elevated on wooden telephone poles in most parts of the district.
(14) Relationship of open space to structures. Open space occurs in the form of vacant land, a playground, and
parking lots, and frequently occurs on corner lots. Open space in the form of front yards to buildings is generally
very shallow. Some buildings are situated on the front lot line or very close to it; this usually occurs on northsouth streets east of Rosa Parks Boulevard, and on Porter Street.
(15) Scale of facades and facade elements. The majority of buildings in the district are small in scale, with the
exception of multi-story industrial buildings and apartment buildings, which are medium to large in scale and
therefore do not comply with the original scale of the neighborhood. Facade elements, such as bays, steep roofs,
gables, and/or verandas, are moderate in scale. Details within these elements are generally small in scale.
(16) Directional expression of front elevations. One-story residences are usually slightly wider than tall but their
directional expression is vertical due to the gable of the steeply pitched roof. Two-story, Italianate and Greek
Revival single-family residences are vertical in directional expression, while duplexes in those styles are usually
neutral. Two-story Queen Anne buildings are either neutral in directional expression or have vertically expressed
front facades, depending on the projection of gables and/or roof slopes. Terraces are horizontal in directional
expression, churches are emphatically vertical, and industrial buildings are either vertically or horizontally
expressed, depending on the number of stories. Individual Victorian commercial buildings are usually vertical
but may form a commercial row that is horizontal.

 (17) Rhythm of building setbacks. Setbacks vary from area to area within the district, although they are usually
consistent within blocks. In general, buildings have very shallow front yards, although buildings may relate to
the building lines differently due to porch projections and pays where they exist. Buildings on the north-south
streets and corners are very close to the front lot lines. Some industrial and commercial buildings are situated
directly on the front lot line.
(18) Relationship of lot coverage. Lot coverage ranges from zero (0) percent to one hundred (100) percent, the
average residential coverage being approximately forty (40) percent. Industrial buildings are in the upper range,
as are some corner stores and some houses on north-south cross streets.
(19) Degree of complexity within the facade. Early buildings are simple and straightforward. Queen Anne style
buildings are more complex in massing and detail but are not overly complex.
(20) Orientation, vistas, overviews. In general, buildings East of Rosa Parks Boulevard are oriented toward the
east-west streets, with Trumbull Avenue, Eighth Street and Sixth Street being exceptions. Buildings west of
Rosa Parks Boulevard are most often oriented toward the north-south streets. Garages are oriented toward the
alleys. Commercial buildings are located on corner lots and on Michigan Avenue and sometimes on corner lots
within the residential areas. There are vistas of downtown Detroit and Tiger Stadium from the Corktown District.
The general overview is that of small-scaled mixed-use neighborhood with major thoroughfares and major
landmarks, such as Tiger Stadium, Michigan Central Station, and Most Holy Trinity R.C. Church surrounding
the district.
(21) Symmetric or asymmetric appearance. Most buildings in the district are asymmetrical in appearance, but
result in balanced compositions.
(22) General environmental character. The Corktown Historic District, with its narrow lots, shallow front yards,
and small-scaled buildings, has a low-density, urban, mixed use character of a pre-automobile city. Its original
cohesiveness has been eroded by housing demolition over the years. Anchored by Tiger Stadium on the north,
Michigan Central Station and Roosevelt Park on the west, Most Holy Trinity Church and the John C. Lodge
Expressway on the east, and the West Side Industrial Park on the south, the neighborhood is set apart from its
surrounding environment, resulting in a definable community in the shadows of Downtown Detroit.

RECOMMENDATION
The proposed new construction infills the location of a former two-family flat with a structure built for the same
purpose, is compatible with the massing, size, scale, and architectural features of its environment, and does not
destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The design includes several features to add complexity and
visual interest without mimicking historic precedents, and is compliant with the district’s Elements of Design. Staff
therefore recommends that the Commission approve the proposed new construction, as the proposed design appears
to be appropriate per Secretary of the Interior Standards 1, 9, and 10.

Zieger Properties, LLC.
2512 San Elijo Ave.
Cardiff, CA 92007
RE: 2225 Wabash St – New Construction Historic District Commission Submission
2225 Wabash is a mid-block lot on the west side of Wabash nearly equidistant from Michigan Avenue to
the North and Dalzelle Street to the South. The proposed structure is a two-family home comprised of
an upper and lower two-bedroom flat.
1. Height:
The proposed structure is two and a half stories, with a total height of approximately 27’-8” above
grade. This height is constant with the adjacent properties which are also two and a half stories tall.
2. Proportion of Front Façade:
The front façade of the proposed structure is approximately 24’-0” wide, making it slightly taller than
it is wide, but an overall square in proportion. The south portion of the front façade is pushed further
back, giving the remaining portion of the façade the appearance that it is taller than it is wide,
emphasizing verticality.
3. Proportion of Openings:
The windows proposed for the structure are generally wood casement style. Individual windows are
taller than they are wide and grouped together to form larger areas of glazing. On the front façade,
the openings make up about 20% of the façade.
4. Rhythm of Solid to Void:
Openings in the facades of the proposed structure are regular and ordered, like the existing Greek
revival homes on either side of the proposed structure. Individual windows and groups of windows
are placed directly above each other form the first to second floor.
5. Rhythm of Spacing of Buildings:
The proposed structure has been placed with a minimum setback from the north property line. The
close placement to the existing house to the north is consistent with the close spacing between
other existing homes on the block. The lot directly south of the proposed structure has a width of
approximately 18’-0”, and it is anticipated that this space will remain open.
6. Rhythm of Entrance and/or front porch projections:
The proposed structure features an asymmetric front porch entry, which wraps around to the south
façade. The front porch is comprised of two small entry porches, one for each unit, and built-in brick

 planter boxes. The planter boxes start at the north side of the front façade and increase in height
toward the south end. The
7. Materials:
The proposed structure is comprised of wood framing with a concrete foundation, and a metal
standing-seam roof. The majority of the facades are clad in wood ship-lap siding. Metal trim and
accent panels are used around the windows. Brick is used as the skirting at the base of the structure,
and projects out at the front façade to form planter boxes and the front porch. The brick front porch
and plater boxes wrap to the south façade, where the full two-story height of the stair volume in the
south-east corner of the structure is also clad in brick. The main material concept is to create
hierarchy and order by using the different materials to define zones that nest inside each other. The
majority of the facades are clad with painted wood ship-lap siding. Within this field are zones
defined by wood ship-lap siding stained in a natural color, along with windows and metal accent trim
that wrap the corners of the structure.
8. Textures:
Texture is at play in the relationship between the ship-lap wood siding, brick, and smooth metal
accent and trim panels. The majority of the front façade is clad in vertically oriented wood ship-lap
siding. Nested within the field of vertically oriented siding is a zone comprised of horizontally
oriented wood ship-lap siding and windows, with metal panel introduced where a group of windows
wraps the corner.
9. Colors:
The color palette of the proposed structure has been kept neutral and natural in order to blend in
with the existing homes on the block. The brick, metal panels and roof, and painted wood ship-lap
siding are all within a gray-scale pallet. The stained wood ship-lap siding is stained with a warm
natural color, which acts as an accent to the overall composition, and adds visual interest.
10. Architectural Details:
The architectural details of the proposed structure are very simple in order to complement the
existing modest homes on the block. The overall massing and roof shape are similar to adjacent
historic homes, while the clean simplified detailing is more contemporary. In order to match the level
of detail and visual interest of the existing homes, a concept of layering and texture is used to create
depth and hierarchy in the facades. The vertically oriented wood ship-lap siding projects out from
the wall slightly further than the horizontally oriented siding. Windows and metal panel are further
inset from the wood siding, creating multiple layers of depth. While the facades do not feature much
ornament, this layering of materials in addition to the projected porch/planters and roof overhangs
will create dynamic and interesting shadow lines on the façade. The overall effect is intended to be
effective but subtly, as to not overwhelm the character of the adjacent existing homes.

 11. Roof Shapes:
Similar to many existing homes on the block, the proposed structure features a simple roof line with
a single ridge running down the center of the structure, and front-facing gables.
12. Wall of Continuity (setbacks):
The front setback of the proposed structure is similar to adjacent properties. This helps maintain the
already established wall of continuity. In addition, the projection of the front porch and built-in
planters along the front façade of the structure maintain the secondary wall of continuity created by
the front porches of adjacent homes.
13. Landscape Features:
The shallow front lawn of the proposed structure is grass turf, consistent with adjacent properties.
More decorative bushes and flowering plants will be included in the built-in planter boxes that wrap
the front and south facades. Vegetated screens are also proposed at the south-east corner of the
structure, increasing the amount of decorative vegetation visible from the street. A simple concrete
foot path extends from the sidewalk along the south façade to provide access to the entries of each
unit.
14. Open space:
The lot directly to the south of the proposed structure has approximately 18’-0” of frontage along
Wabash street. It is anticipated that this narrow front portion of the lot will remain open in the future.
While not part of this property, the open space will create the appearance of an open side-lot from
the street.
15. Scale of Facades/Façade Elements:
The overall structure is a similar scale to the existing homes on the block. The front elevation is fairly
simple with few façade elements. Window groupings are always in the same plane as the overall
façade. Window groupings are generally 3-4 windows wide, which is approximately one-quarter to
one-third of the overall façade width. The south façade of the structure features a projected balcony
for the second unit. The balcony occurs in front of a grouping of windows and is the same width as
this group of windows, about one-quarter of the overall south façade width. This balcony occurs over
a side porch used as the entry for the lower unit. The balcony projects out the same distance as the
porch below.
16. Directional Expression of Front Elevation:
The directional expression of the front elevation is generally vertical. The south portion of the front
façade is recessed at the entry, and clad in darker brick, causing it to visually recede. The remaining
portion of the façade is clad in vertically oriented wood ship-lap siding, painted white. This
composition visually reduces the width of the front façade, emphasizing its verticality.

 17. Rhythm of Setbacks:
The front setback of the proposed structure is consistent with adjacent properties on the block.
18. Lot Coverage:
a. Lot Size: 3676 Square Feet
b. Building Footprint: 1315
c. Percentage of lot Coverage: 35.8%
19. Degree of Complexity in Façade:
The proposed structure is very simple in massing and façade complexity. The façade uses a simple
palate of 4 materials, organized in a way to provide hierarchy, depth and interest without relying on
additional detail and applied architectural elements.
20. Orientation/Vistas/Views:
The long axis of the proposed structure is oriented east-west with the front of the structure facing
Wabash street. Bedrooms are placed at the far east and west ends, each with views either to the
street (to the east) or back toward the train station (to the west). Living spaces are situated in the
center of the structure, with views facing south. The adjacent property to the south has
approximately 18’-0” of width and it is anticipated to remain open. This gives opportunity for views
and daylight to the living spaces.
21. Symmetric or asymmetric appearance:
The appearance of the proposed structure is asymmetric to complement existing asymmetric homes
on the block. Windows on the front façade are aligned to the north edge, while the recessed front
entry is situated to the south side. This arrangement of openings along with the “nested” approach
to materials creates a balanced composition.
22. General Character:
Corktown is made up of modestly detailed small-scaled homes on narrow lots creating a dense
walkable neighborhood. The proposed structure follows the simple massing and closely spaced
arrangement precedent set by the existing adjacent homes. The materials used for the proposed
structure speak to the textural quality of the existing homes with the use of wood ship-lap siding and
brick. More contemporary materials such as the standing seam metal roof and metal trim panels
speak to the longevity of the neighborhood and the notion that Corktown houses are built to last.
The homes in Corktown were built over various periods of time, and are examples of many
architectural styles. What makes the neighborhood cohesive is the attention to scale, proportion,
and quality in each home regardless of style. While the proposed structure utilizes some
contemporary elements, the overall scale, massing, and textural quality are inspired by and designed
to complement the overall Corktown character.
