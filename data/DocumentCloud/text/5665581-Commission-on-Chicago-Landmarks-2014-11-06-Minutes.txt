The following projects were reviewed by the PRC:
1. 3718 N. Springfield
30th Ward
Villa District
Proposed exterior and interior rehabilitation of a single-family home including new
rear addition, three new dormers, and removal of existing non-historic garage and
side driveway.
Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. Window details shall be submitted for Historic Preservation staff
review and approval with the permit application;
2. Fiber Cement Siding shall have a smooth finish, and the lap exposure
shall match the typical lap exposure of historic wood clapboard;
3. The applicant shall provide an assessment of the historic stucco by a
qualified professional addressing whether the stucco can be retained
and repaired in place. If complete replacement is required Historic
Preservation staff shall be notified to view the underlying condition
after removal. If the existing stucco is found to be a later alteration the
underlying historic cladding may be exposed and repaired, with all
changes in scope subject to staff review and approval; and,
4. The project as proposed would require a zoning variation to reduce the
rear yard setback and increase the permitted floor area. The
Commission takes no position regarding any requested
variance/adjustment relative to the zoning code requirements

 2. 711 S. Dearborn
4th Ward
Printing House Row District
Proposed removal of the rooftop wood water tank and steel structure and removal of
the steel chimney.
Action:

Approved unanimously as submitted.

The Committee also approved that moving forward, unless water tanks are
specifically addressed in the landmark designation ordinance for a specific property
or district, Historic Preservation staff shall review and approve the applications for
their removal without further review and decision of the Permit Review Committee or
the Commission.
3. 736 W. Randolph
27th Ward
Proposed Fulton-Randolph Market District
Proposed exterior and interior renovation of a 2-story masonry building, including a
new storefront and rooftop deck and pergolas.
Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. New storefront and window dimensions and details shall be submitted
for Historic Preservation review and approval with the permit plans.
The existing transom windows, if salvageable, shall be incorporated
into the new storefront system. The front entrance shall be modified to
better align with the transom windows above and the overall design
characteristics of the new storefront;
2. The side parapet on the east elevation shall be increased in height with
matching common brick to match the height of the parapet on the front
elevation (30’- ¾”), extending north to the elevator enclosure (48’-2”)
to better screen the roof deck and railings; and,
3. The applicant shall work with Historic Preservation staff to further
decrease the visibility of the rooftop pergola closest to Randolph,
either through redesign or increased setback. Such revisions shall be
reviewed at the staff level and if they are determined to be consistent
with the character of the building and the district shall be approved.
Otherwise, the application may return to the Permit Review
Committee for further consideration.

4. 1060 W. Addison
44th Ward
Wrigley Field
Proposed exterior alterations to Clark Street façade due to structural reinforcement
work.
Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
Clark Street Façade Ground-Floor:
1. The new A-line grade beam spanning between Columns 1-20 of which

 a portion will be exposed above grade but is structurally required per
the Thornton Tomassetti report dated 10/22/14, is approved with a 1”
notch for the top 9” of the exposed side of the beam;
2. The reconstruction of the missing ground-floor stucco and clay-tile
walls as shown on the “Proposed Alternate” axonometric drawing
dated 11/6/14, is approved with an offset from the column face by
approximately 7” based on physical evidence and historic photos per
the Harboe Architect report dated 10/27/14. The top 9” of the exposed
grade beam shall be finished with a stucco coating to match the stucco
walls in texture and color;
Clark Street Façade Mezzanine-Floor:
3. Given that the A-line steel columns, beams, and mezzanine slabs from
Columns 1-29 need to be reinforced and/or replaced to meet code
requirements, the following related work is approved to perform the
structural work necessary:
a. The existing historic mezzanine stucco and brick infill walls facing
Clark Street may be dismantled and shall be reconstructed using
salvaged brick to match the historic configuration, replicating the
number of brick courses, brick pattern, window sizes, and original
stucco texture and color. Control joints shall be located only as
necessary at material changes or at changes in plane, but
eliminated as much as possible within the flat portions of the
stucco walls. A mock-up of the finished stucco wall shall be
reviewed and approved by Historic Preservation staff prior to order
and installation;
b. Historic metal fascia panels under the gutter, identified by the
Harboe Architect survey dated 10/28/14, shall be salvaged and
reinstalled to match the historic configuration and any elements
deteriorated beyond repair shall be replaced in-kind;
c. The historic corner Marquee, proposed to be retained in place
(between Columns 29-31), shall be protected as necessary from
any damage;
4. Enlarged details of the replacement windows, sills, fascia panel
elements, and new downspouts shall be included in the permit plans
and all exterior wall samples to be reviewed and approved by Historic
Preservation staff prior to order and installation;
Master Project:
5. Given the overall permit and construction complexity and 4 year timeframe of the phased rehabilitation master project, the applicant will be
expected to do the following:
a. Continue to schedule and coordinate weekly site visits as well as
bi-monthly design team meetings, or at such intervals as requested
by the Historic Preservation staff;
b. As previously requested and for future phases, the applicant shall
provide all permit application drawings at least 30 days prior to
submission of permit applications; and,
c. Provide periodic status reports before each phase to be presented

 by staff for information only to the Permit Review Committee of
the Commission on Chicago Landmarks; and,
6. All conditions of approval from previous Commission reviews of the
overall master project will continue to be applicable; and,
7. Prior to the issuance of any future permits, and subject to the review
and approval of the Commissioner of the Department of Planning and
Development, the applicant shall (a) hire an independent consultant to
act as the City’s inspecting agent throughout the dismantlement,
repair, and reconstruction process, (b) submit evidence of the
percentage of cumulative demolition as each phase and/or permit is
issued for staff review.
5. 4804 S. Woodlawn
4th Ward
Kenwood District
Violation: Construction of a 9’-3” tall and 7’-0” tall solid wood fence at the corner
property contrary to approved permit.
Action:

The Committee determined that the fence did not meet the Commission’s
guidelines, standards, and criteria, and therefore disapproved the Permit
Application.
