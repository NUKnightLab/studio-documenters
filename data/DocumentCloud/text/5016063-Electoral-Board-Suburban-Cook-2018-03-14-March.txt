PROPOSED RESOLUTION
CALLING FOR A MEETING OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE COMMITTEE TO INVESTIGATE
ISSUES SURROUNDING ELECTRONIC MONITORING
WHEREAS, Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart has communicated that too many violent offenders are being
released on electronic monitoring while awaiting trial, and
WHEREAS, Cook County has made significant strides in criminal justice reform that have resulted in a
much lower population at the Cook County Jail, and
WHEREAS, criminal justice reform is a crucial issue, but it must be approached in a common-sense matter,
and
WHEREAS, individuals accused of violent crimes deserve every civil right, but the County court system
should not be returning those accused of violent crimes to the streets at the cost of all other residents of the
County, and
WHEREAS, as more individuals are released on electronic monitoring instead of sitting in the County jail,
the Sheriff’s office must be given the resources necessary to appropriately keep track of those individuals,
and
WHEREAS, the County Board needs to be kept apprised of any issues surrounding criminal justice reform
because it is the fiduciary body of the jail and probation systems, and
WHEREAS, the State’s Attorney of Cook County, the Public Defender, the Sheriff and the Chief Judge of
the circuit court shall appear or send a representative to testify about this issue before the Criminal Justice
committee of the County Board.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the Cook County Board of Commissioners and the
President of the Board that representatives from the State’s Attorney’s Office, the Public Defender’s Office,
the Chief Judge’s Office, and the Sheriff’s Office shall appear before the Criminal Justice Committee to
discuss the issue of violent offenders being released on electronic monitoring.

AUTHORIZING EXECUTION OF AN INTERGOVERNMENTAL AGREEMENT
FOR COST SHARING AND START-UP ACTIVITIES RELATED TO THE

within the Village; and
WHEREAS, the Village now desires to participate in the creation of a new larger enterprise zone, to be
known as the West Regional Enterprise Zone (the “Enterprise Zone”), along with the Village of Bellwood
(“Bellwood”), the Village of Broadview (“Broadview”), the Village of Melrose Park (“Melrose Park”), and
the County of Cook (“Cook County”) (collectively, the “Participating Local Governments”); and
WHEREAS, the Enterprise Zone shall be established through adoption of ordinances by the Participating

jointly cooperate relative to establishing the Enterprise Zone, to share certain of the costs of establishing

cooperation and cost sharing (the “Initial Intergovernmental Agreement”). Once the Enterprise Zone is
formally established by an intergovernmental agreement (the “IGA”) and certification by DCEO, and the
respective obligations of the Participating Local Governments under the Initial Intergovernmental
Agreement are satisfied, the Initial Intergovernmental Agreement will be terminated. Upon termination, the
IGA will control any further operating, procedural, and cost-sharing related to the Enterprise Zone; and

the Illinois Municipal Code (65 ILCS 5/1-1-1 et seq.) and the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act (5 ILCS

the County.

 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners does hereby
agrees as follows:
SECTION 1: Each Whereas paragraph above is incorporated by reference into this Section 1 and made
a part hereof as material and operative provisions of this Resolution.
SECTION 2: The President and Board of Commissioners authorize the execution of the Initial
Intergovernmental Agreement relative to initial start-up activities, cooperation and costsharing in the creation of the Enterprise Zone, to be substantially in the form of the draft
attached hereto and made a part hereof as Exhibit “1”. Any minor changes to the draft
Agreement prior to its execution are subject to the approval of the President and Board of
Commissioners. The County President and County Clerk, or their designees, are authorized
to execute the Initial Intergovernmental Agreement upon its finalization, and to execute
and deliver all other instruments and documents that are necessary in order to fulfill the
obligations under the Initial Intergovernmental Agreement. Further, the President and
Board of Commissioners designates the Bureau of Economic Development as the County’s
designee on the Start-Up Committee pursuant to Section 3.A. of the Initial
Intergovernmental Agreement.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
DECLARING A VOTE OF NO CONFIDENCE IN THE COOK COUNTY ASSESSOR AND
COUNTY BOARD PRESIDENT IN REGARD TO REGRESSIVITY IN THE PROPERTY TAX
SYSTEM
WHEREAS, Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle and Assessor Joe Berrios both were sworn
in to their respective offices in 2010, and
WHEREAS, in the summer of 2017, the Chicago Tribune published a series outlining decades of
regressively in residential property assessments in Cook County, and
WHEREAS, in response to that article and a hearing of the County Board, the Assessor’s Office and
President’s Office announced a study of the assessment system to be conducted by the Civic Consulting
Alliance, and
WHEREAS, that study confirmed the Tribune’s findings of a failure to accurately assess residential
properties in Cook County, and
WHEREAS, the study further confirmed that Cook County’s property tax assessment system is causing a
wealth transfer from owners of lower-value homes to those of higher-value homes, and
WHEREAS, both President Preckwinkle and Assessor Berrios have indicated that the issues with the
residential assessment system have existed for 40 years, yet those issues have persisted since they each took
office, and
WHEREAS, the study by the Civic Consulting Alliance is simply the latest in a series of studies outlining
issues in the assessment system, and
WHEREAS, the Assessor’s Office has said repeatedly that homeowners can simply appeal their property
taxes if they feel there’s an issue, but the study found that the regressivity is even worse at the appellate
level, and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners has no confidence in the ability of the current
leadership’s ability to reform the system, and
WHEREAS, the County Board ought to be included in the process and assist in finding an outside entity
to reform the system.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that it ought
to be updated regularly about the status of improving the Cook County property tax assessment system.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
COMPREHENSIVE GUN CONTROL
WHEREAS, According to national statistics, every year in our country, a firearm is used in nearly 500,000
crimes, resulting in the deaths and injuries of more than 110,000 people, and
WHEREAS, According to statistics from USA Today, between 2006 and 2017 there were mass shootings
approximately every 16 days in the United States, with the most recent incident in Parkland Florida sparking
a renewed and broad sweeping national conversation on the need for common-sense gun solutions to keep
our citizens safe while protecting the 2nd Amendment, and
WHEREAS, In Chicago and Cook County, particularly minority communities that often have the greatest
economic needs, gun violence is a traumatic and daily occurrence that has reached a crisis point, prevents
economic growth and leads to increased incarceration and the perpetuation of the cycle of violence, and
WHEREAS, According to statistics in 2017, there were 743 homicides as a result of gun violence in
Chicago and Cook County, and,
WHEREAS, Gun violence has taken a massive toll on Cook County, taking the lives of countless men and
women, many young, leaving physical, psychology, emotional scars for the victims and their families that
survive, and producing untreated and pervasive trauma in communities, individuals and children, and
WHEREAS, The effects and costs of gun violence can be seen throughout the county in our criminal justice
system, included but not limited to the offices of the Sheriff, State’s Attorney, and Public Defenders, the
hospital system, and Medical Examiner’s Office.
WHEREAS, The time is now for comprehensive gun control laws. It is time for our federal and state
representatives to take a stand on this crisis, and
WHEREAS, Cook County echoes President Donald Trump’s call for strengthened background checks, the
ban of bump stocks and raising the age from 18 to 21 for the purchase of assault-style weapons, and
WHEREAS, Cook County calls upon its residents to reach out to their elected officials to urge the passage
of a variety of common-sense gun control policies in Springfield, including but not limited to requiring gun
dealers to be licensed, strengthened background checks, and banning the use of military-style weapons,
high capacity magazines and the civilian sale of body armor, and
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, A step toward more comprehensive gun safety laws is a step in the
right direction because every gun death, is one too many.

 THEREFORE, BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, The Cook County President and the Cook County
Board Commissioners call upon Washington D.C. and the State of Illinois to pass comprehensive gun
control laws immediately to protect all residents of our country.
