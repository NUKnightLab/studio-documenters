Submitting report relative to Supplemental Opinion on Special Assessments.
(There is no legal support for an ordinance that would extract individual
parcels located within a special assessment district that receive the benefit of
the service or improvement that is the premise of that special assessment
district from that particular levy. The foundation of a special assessment
district is that all of the parcels within that district receive a benefit from the
special assessment levy that is distinguishable from general property taxes or
a municipality-wide special assessment so that those parcels within the district
are responsible for the levy wile property outside of that district are not. The
cost of the benefit is apportioned to every property in the district based on the
value of the improvement (or service) to that property. In fact, most properties
exempt from ad valorem or general property taxes are specifically not exempt
from a special assessment levy, this includes certain government property.)
