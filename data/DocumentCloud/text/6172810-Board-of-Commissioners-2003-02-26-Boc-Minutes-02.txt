MINUTES OF THE SPECIAL TELECONFERENCE MEETING

OF THE

COMMISSIONERS OF THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
February 26, 2003

The Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority held a Special Teleconference Meeting at
the Corporate Office located at 626 West Jackson, 6th Floor Conference Room on Wednesday,
February 26, 2003 at 10:00 a.m.
At this time, Adam Schwartz, representative of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)
addressed the Board. According to Mr. Schwartz, while the ACLU is mindful that CHA has a
duty to provide safe, stable crime free environment for public housing tenants, it is the ACLU’s
belief that suspicion- less drug testing is not the appropriate or legitimate form for achieving that
goal and requested that the CHA remove the proposed provision in the Lake Park Crescent
proposed lease.
The meeting was then called to order by the Chairperson, and upon roll call, those present and
absent were as follows:
Present:
Sharon Gist Gilliam
Hallie Amey
Leticia Peralta Davis
Earnest Gates
Dr. Mildred Harris
Michael Ivers
Sandra Young
Absent:

Mamie Bone
Lorie Healey

Also present were Montel Gayles, Chief of Staff; Gail Niemann, General Counsel; and other
Chicago Housing Authority Staff Members.
There being a quorum present the meeting duly convened and business was transacted as
follows:
The Chairperson announced that the Special Teleconference Meeting was called for the sole
purpose of approving the MTW Annual Report, approval of a Form of Lease for Lake Park
Crescent, approval to purchase four new units in the One South Levitt Housing Development,
and recommendation to ratify the obligation and approve the expenditure of Contract
Modification funds for the Senior Rehabilitation Program.

 THE CERTIFICATE AS TO SERVICE OF NOTICE OF SPECIAL TELECONFERENCE
MEETING and the WAIVER OF NOTICE AND CONSENT TO SPECIAL
TELECONFERENCE MEETING, as signed by the Commissioners of said Authority, were read
and ordered spread upon the minutes of this Special Teleconference meeting and filed for record.

 (Item No. 1)
In January 2000, the CHA Commissioners approved the Authority’s Plan for Transformation.
The Plan for Transformation was submitted to and approved by HUD and incorporated into a
Moving to Work (MTW) Demonstration Agreement. The Agreement was subsequently
amended in January 2001, requiring the CHA to produce and submit an Annual Plan and Annual
Report to HUD. HUD requires that this report be submitted annually, along with a Board of
Commissioners’ resolution approving the report, no later than 60 days after the end of the CHA’s
fiscal year. The resolution for Item 1 approves submission of the FY2002 MTW Annual Report
and follows the format to “provide the information necessary for HUD to assess the CHA’s
performance, in both regular operations and in activities authorized by the MTW Demonstration
Program”.
Commissioner Gates moved the adoption of the following resolution.
RESOLUTION NO. 2003-CHA-28
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated February 21,
2003 requesting approval of the “FY2002 MTW Annual Report”, attached hereto;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners approves the attached “FY2002 MTW Annual
Report”, and grants authorization to the Chief Executive Officer to make such
corrections thereto as he deems necessary and to submit the report to the United
States Department of Housing and Urban development.

 Motion to adopt said resolution was seconded by Commissioner Ivers and the voting was as
follows:
Ayes:

Sharon Gist Gilliam
Hallie Amey
Leticia Peralta Davis
Earnest Gates
Dr. Mildred Harris
Michael Ivers
Sandra Young

Nays:

None

There being no questions or discussion, the Chairperson thereupon decla red said motion carried
and said resolution adopted.
(Item No. 2)
The resolution for Item 2 approves the form of lease for the Lake Park Crescent Rental Phase I
development. The developer has an interest to implement its own lease forms and policy that
encourages consistent community standards and the effective management of its mixed income
developments. The lease has to accommodate various aspects of the multiple types of tenants and
characteristics of a mixed finance transaction. The form of lease for Rental Phase I of the Lake
Park Crescent deve lopment is required at this time to facilitate the closing of this development
transaction. Both documents have been subject to extensive negotiation among the CHA, the
Developer and the Central Advisory Committee. Notice for the public comment period was
given on January 24, 2003 in accordance with applicable requirements and consideration will be
given to comments provided in finalizing the documents with the Developer and the owner
entity.
Discussion then ensued with regards to site specific criteria, drug testing, Tenant Selection Plan
and material changes to lease. Satisfied with the responses and there being no further questions
or comments, Commissioner Gates moved the adoption of the following resolution:
RESOLUTION NO. 2003-CHA-29
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated February 18,
2003, entitled “Authorization for approval of a Form of Lease for Rental Phase I
of the Lake Park Crescent development and to amend the CHA Admissions and
Occupancy Policy to incorporate such document as an addendum thereto”
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners hereby approves the attached form of lease in
substantially the form presented to the Board for the Lake Park Crescent Rental
Phase I development and hereby approves an amendment to the Chicago Housing
Authority’s Admissions and Occupancy Policy to incorporate the approved form
as an addendum. The Chairman of the Board or the Chief Executive Officer is
hereby authorized to approve final changes in these forms, including changes
based on HUD requirements, or such changes, if any, resulting from any
applicable notice and comment process. Such approval shall constitute conclusive
evidence of the Board’s approval of any and all such changes.

Motion to adopt said resolution was seconded by Commissioner Harris and the voting was as
follows:
Ayes:
Sharon Gist Gilliam
Hallie Amey

 Leticia Peralta Davis
Earnest Gates
Dr. Mildred Harris
Michael Ivers
Sandra Young
Nays:

None

There being no questions or discussion, the Chairperson thereupon declared said motion carried
and said resolution adopted.
(Item 3)
The resolution for Item 3 ratifies the obligation and approves the expenditure of contract
modification funds for the below listed contractors who have existing contracts with the
Authority to provide general renovation and rehabilitation of senior buildings. Cha nge
orders/contract modifications associated with the general renovation program were required to
address health and safety concerns, critical path tasks, and infrastructure finishes. The change
orders/contract modifications were a result of discovered conditions, building code requirements,
owner directed changes, and design corrections. The CHA has been able to verify that the
amounts invoiced by the contractors are for actual services rendered and/or materials and
equipment provided. The failure to ratify the contracts listed above will likely result in
protracted litigation with the contractors, who allege they have acted under the authority of the
CHA, and that the CHA has been unjustly enriched.
Commissioner Young moved the adoption of the following resolution.
RESOLUTION NO. 2003-CHA-30
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated February 7,
2003, titled, “Authorization to ratify the obligation and approve the expenditure of

THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer of his
designee to ratify the obligation and approve the expenditure of contract
modification funds for the Senior Rehabilitation Program with the following
