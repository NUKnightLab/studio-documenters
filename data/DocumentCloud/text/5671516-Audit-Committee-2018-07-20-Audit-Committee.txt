 AGENDA ITEM #7A

Date: July 20, 2018
To:

Great Lakes Water Authority Audit Committee

From: Jon Wheatley, Public Finance Manager
Re:

Proposed Resolution Regarding Approval of Series Ordinance Authorizing Issuance
and Sale of Water Supply System Revenue Refunding Bonds an Amount Not to
Exceed $225,000,000 (Ordinance 2018-02)

Background: In order for the Great Lakes Water Authority (“GLWA”) to proceed with the
refunding of various outstanding water supply system bonds for the purpose of achieving
annual debt service savings, the GLWA Board must approve a resolution approving the
Series Ordinance. There is no new money as part of this water refunding bond issue.

The Series Ordinance sets forth the guidelines for the Refunding Bonds and authorizes the
Chief Executive Officer or the Chief Financial Officer to execute the final terms of the Bonds,
paying issuance costs and signing of the Bond Purchase Agreement, within the parameters
set forth in the Series Ordinance. The final par amount of the Refunding Bonds will be
determined at the time of pricing and is based on current bond market pricing levels,
issuance costs, and the par amount of the bonds to be refunded as determined by the
savings level achieved. While the approval of the resolution gives GLWA the authorization to
issue refunding bonds, GLWA does not have to proceed with the refunding if market
conditions become less favorable when it comes time to price the bonds.
Key Provisions:
• Not to Exceed Par Amount: $225 million
• Maximum Coupon Rate: 5.25%
• Minimum Purchase Price: 99% of principal amount of bonds
• Maximum Underwriter Discount: 0.40% of principal amount of bonds
• Present Value Savings: Equal to or greater than 5.00% of principal amount of bonds
to be refunded

Page 8

 Additional Provisions: Similar to the 2016 water and sewer bond ordinances approved
by the GLWA Board, Ordinance No. 2018-02 also contains the “springing amendment”
provision in Section 21- Amendments to Ordinance. As noted on page 20, this section gives
GLWA the ability to reduce or eliminate the bond reserve requirement for the senior lien
bonds when at least 2 of the 3 national rating agencies rate the senior lien bonds in the AA
category, provided that the reduction in the reserve requirement would not negatively
affect the outstanding ratings. The amendments will become effective upon the deemed
consent of at least 51% of the holders of the outstanding senior lien bonds. GLWA will add
this springing amendment to each future series ordinance to obtain the 51% consent level.
The currently level of water consents achieved is 32.9% for senior lien bonds and 57.8%
for second lien bonds, before the issuance of the bonds herein.
Budget Impact: None at this time.

Proposed Action: Audit Committee recommends that the Great Lakes Water Authority
Board approve the resolution for the Approval of Series Ordinance Authorizing Issuance
and Sale of Water Supply System Revenue Refunding Bonds an Amount Not to Exceed
$225,000,000 as presented, at its regular meeting on August 8, 2018.

 AGENDA ITEM #7B

Date: July 20, 2018
To:

Great Lakes Water Authority Audit Committee

From: Jon Wheatley, Public Finance Manager
Re:

Resolution Regarding Approval of Series Ordinance Authorizing Issuance and Sale of
Sewage Disposal System Revenue and Revenue Refunding Bonds an Amount Not to
Exceed $325,000,000 (Ordinance 2018-03)

Background: In order for the Great Lakes Water Authority (“GLWA”) to proceed with
issuance of new sewage disposal system bonds and the refunding of various outstanding
water bonds for the purpose of achieving annual debt service savings, the GLWA Board
must approve a resolution approving the Series Ordinance.

The Series Ordinance sets forth the guidelines for the New Money and Refunding Bonds
and authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or the Chief Financial Officer to execute the final
terms of the Bonds, paying issuance costs and signing of the Bond Purchase Agreement,
within the parameters set forth in the Series Ordinance.

New Money Portion- The authorized amount for the New Money Bonds in Section 3, page 4
is for an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $100,000,000. As you will recall, the
Board authorized a Notice of Intent at its March 8, 2017 meeting which set the borrowing
limit for GLWA sewage disposal system bonds at $275 million. This is the third series of
sewer bonds from that Notice of Intent. Previous authorizations include an amount not to
exceed $45,000,000 for the Detroit River Interceptor project and the Central Offload
Facility project, which are scheduled to close in September 2018 as well as the Rouge River
Outfall disinfection project in the amount of $38,450,000 which closed in June 2017.

Refunding Portion- The authorized amount for the Refunding Bonds in Section 3, page 4 is
for an aggregate principal amount of not to exceed $225,000,000. The final par amount of
the Refunding Bonds will be determined at the time of pricing and is based on current bond
market pricing levels, issuance costs and the par amount of the bonds to be refunded as
determined by the savings level achieved. While the approval of the resolution gives GLWA
the authorization to issue refunding bonds, GLWA does not have to proceed with the
refunding if market conditions become less favorable when it comes time to price the bonds.

Page 33

 .
Key Provisions:
• Not to Exceed Par Amount: $225 million
• Maximum Coupon Rate: 5.25%
• Minimum Purchase Price: 99% of principal amount of bonds
• Maximum Underwriter Discount: 0.40% of principal amount of bonds
• Present Value Savings: Equal to or greater than 5.00% of principal amount of bonds
to be refunded

Additional Provisions: Similar to the 2016 water and sewer bond ordinances approved
by the GLWA Board, Ordinance No. 2018-03 also contains the “springing amendment”
provision in Section 21- Amendments to Ordinance. As noted on page 20, this section gives
GLWA the ability to reduce or eliminate the bond reserve requirement for the senior lien
bonds when at least two of the three national rating agencies rate the senior lien bonds in
the AA category, provided that the reduction in the reserve requirement would not
negatively affect the outstanding ratings. The amendments will become effective upon the
deemed consent of at least 51% of the holders of the outstanding senior lien bonds. GLWA
will add this springing amendment to each future series ordinance to obtain the 51%
consent level. The currently level of sewer consents achieved is 6.7% for senior lien bonds
and 39.2% for second lien bonds, before the issuance of the bonds herein.
Budget Impact: None at this time.

Proposed Action: Audit Committee recommends that the Great Lakes Water Authority
Board approve the resolution Approval of Series Ordinance Authorizing Issuance and Sale
of Sewage Disposal System Revenue and Revenue Refunding Bonds an Amount Not to
Exceed $325,000,000 as presented, at its regular meeting on August 8, 2018.

 AGENDA ITEM #7G

Date: July 20, 2018
To:

Great Lakes Water Authority Audit Committee

From: Deirdre Henry, Treasury Manager

Re:

Proposed Amendments to the Great Lakes Water Authority Investment Policy

Background: The current Investment Policy was approved by the Great Lakes Water
Authority (GLWA) Board on September 14, 2016. A periodic review of the policy is required
to ensure the policies governing the management of the portfolio continue to be relevant and
are implemented and monitored as stated.

Analysis: The PFM Asset Management (PFM) team was asked to review the GLWA
Investment policy. Based on their review and subsequent internal discussions, below are
the following recommended changes.
1. Amend Section 3 to specifically state that GLWA may use a qualified investment
advisor as a money manager.

2. Section 7(C) has been amended to add language defining the parameters under which
GLWA can sell a security.
3. Section 10(E) has been amended to further define restrictions related to the purchase
of bankers’ acceptances.

4. Section 10(J) was added to minimize concentration risk by placing limits and
restrictions on different types of investment securities.

Attached is a memo from PFM along with a mark-up copy of the investment policy reflecting
the proposed changes.
Proposed Action: Recommend approval of the proposed amendments by the GLWA
Board of Directors.

Memorandum
To:
From:
Re:

Deirdre Henry, Treasury Manager
Great Lakes Water Authority
Brian Quinn, Managing Director
PFM Asset Management LLC
Review of the Great Lakes Water Authority’s Investment Policy Statement

PFM Asset Management LLC (“PFM”) appreciates this opportunity to review the investment policy of
the Great Lakes Water Authority (the “Authority” or “GLWA”). Our objective in presenting this
memorandum to the Authority is to identify significant changes that the Authority can undertake to
enhance its investment policy and its portfolio management strategy. The comments below are based on
a comparison of your investment policy to current state investing regulations (Michigan Public Act 20 of
1943 Investment of Surplus Funds of Political Subdivisions, as amended) and our experience with similar
governmental investment policies throughout the state of Michigan and throughout the country.
Based upon our review, PFM feels that the Authority’s investment policy is consistent with the governing
Michigan regulations but has a few areas for improvement. Below is an outline of the material revisions
that PFM feels that the Great Lakes Water Authority can make to enhance its investment policy and
investment management program:
Subject Matter
Money Manager

Selling of Securities
Bankers’ Acceptances
Safety Guidelines

Description of PFM’s Suggestion
The Authority could add a stipulation to the investment policy that contains
added language that specifically states that GLWA can hire a qualified outside
investment advisor as a money manager provided that said advisor meets
standard industry qualifications and is registered with the SEC under the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940.
The investment policy could incorporate language from GFOA standards
that allows for the sale of investments for specific purposes within the overall
investment strategy.
The investment policy could state that bankers’ acceptances carry a top tier
short-term rating (A-1/P-1 or better) and mature not more than 180 days
after the date of purchase.
To enhance its safety, the Authority could possibly formally stipulate in its
investment policy that the purchase of certificates of deposit, commercial
paper, bankers’ acceptances, repurchase agreements, and municipal bonds be
restricted to its own or its qualified investment advisor’s approved issuer list
in which there is an establishment of a formal credit review process when
purchasing these particular types of investments.

Subject Matter
Asset Allocation

Issuer Limitations

Description of PFM’s Suggestion
We recommend that the Authority place an overall limit on certificates of
deposit, commercial paper, bankers’ acceptances, municipal bonds, and repo
and limit the percentage of the portfolio to be invested in these types of
securities to say a maximum of 50% for each security type.
To strengthen diversification, the Authority should incorporate a limit to the
amount of exposure to any one certificate of deposit, municipal bond,
bankers’ acceptance, commercial paper, and repurchase agreement issuer to
5% of the overall portfolio as this would further enhance the risk
management for these types of investments.

While the above changes will help to improve the overall internal controls with regards to the Great Lakes
Water Authority’s investments, please note that no undue risk is being taken.
As a national investment advisor to governmental entities, we benefit from being exposed to numerous
investment policies. It is our opinion that the best policies are simple, not too restrictive, and are
congruent with the prevailing regulatory guidelines. Further, good policy is meant to withstand the test
of time (with the exception of changes in regulations) and does not unduly restrict the investment
manager from making sound investment decisions.

Page 63

 INVESTMENT POLICY
SECTION 1 – PURPOSE
The purpose of this Investment Policy Statement is to establish a clear understanding of the
philosophy and the investment objectives for Financial Assets (the Assets) (defined under section,
“Scope”) of the Great Lakes Water Authority (the GLWA). This document will further describe the
standards that will be utilized by the GLWA’s Board in monitoring investment performance of the
Assets, as well as, serve as a guideline for the GLWA’s Finance Officers, any investment manager
retained by the GLWA, or financial institution(s) utilized by the GLWA in its routine financial
activities.
The investment purpose of the GLWA is to endeavor to accumulate a pool of assets sufficient to
build capital for future use with the corresponding obligations to support near‐term and long‐ term
needs of the GLWA. The Assets are to be invested consistent with the policies of the GLWA’s Board
and this policy document, as amended from time to time and in accordance with Michigan Public
Act 20 of 1943 Investment of Surplus Funds of Political Subdivisions (the Act).
SECTION 2 – GLWA CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER
The Great Lakes Water Authority Board hereby delegates to the Chief Financial Officer/Treasurer
(the CFO), and such delegates as the CFO may designate from time‐to‐time, primary responsibility
for recommending investment policies and strategies, trustees, investment managers and/or
advisors, and other fiduciaries, and monitoring the performance of the Financial Services Group’s

other fiduciaries of the GLWA. This delegation includes the authority to open and close investment
and depository accounts at authorized financial institutions and broker/dealers as noted in

policy and practices for periodic reporting of the results of investment performance, review of
market conditions, and other such information as it may require.
This Investment Policy Statement and the policies and guidance herein are not intended to
substitute or conflict with routine treasury reporting duties and practices of the Financial Services
Group and the Chief Financial Officer as managed for the Great Lakes Water Authority.

Page 1

Page 64

 SECTION 3 – DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY
The Chief Financial Officer delegates management responsibility for the day to day or routine
activities of the investment program to the Treasury Manager, under the supervision of the Chief
Financial Officer. The Treasury Manager shall be responsible for all transactions undertaken and
shall establish a system of controls to regulate the activities of subordinate officials, and their
procedures in the absence of the Treasury Manager with the approval of the Chief Financial
Officer.
The Treasury Manager shall establish written investment policy procedures for the operation of the
investment program consistent with this Investment Policy Statement. No person may engage in
an investment transaction except as provided under the terms of this policy and the procedures

meets standard industry qualifications.

Commented [A1]: Added language to formally allow for an
outside investment manager.

SECTION 4 – SCOPE
This Investment Policy Statement applies to the Financial Assets, all transactions and investment
decisions and practices for which the Treasury Manager has authority and oversight. Such assets
shall include funds classified in the audited financial statements of the GLWA as Current Assets and
Long-Term Assets.
This policy does not cover investment activities of pension fund or deferred compensation
programs.
SECTION 5 – THE PRUDENT INVESTOR STANDARD
The Assets are to be invested and managed with judgment and care; under circumstances then
prevailing; which persons of prudence, discretion and intelligence exercise in the management of
their own affairs, not for speculation, but for investment, considering the probable safety of their
capital as well as the probable income to be derived.
The standard of prudence to be used by the GLWA’s Treasury Manager will be the “prudent
person” and / or “prudent investor” standard and shall be applied in the context of managing the
overall portfolio of assets. The Treasury Manager acting in accordance with written procedures
and this investment policy and exercising due diligence shall be relieved of personal responsibility
for an individual security’s credit risk or market price changes, provided deviations from
expectations are reported in a timely fashion and appropriate action is taken to control adverse
developments.

Approved by the GLWA Board on September 14, 2016

Page 65

 SECTION 6 – ETHICS
Officers and employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from personal business
activity that would conflict with the proper execution and management of the investment
program, or that could impair their ability to make impartial decisions. Employees and investment
officials shall disclose any material interests in financial institutions with which they conduct
business. They shall further disclose any personal financial/investment positions that could be
related to the performance of the investment portfolio. Employees and officers shall refrain from
undertaking personal investment transactions with the same individual with which business is
conducted on behalf of GLWA.
SECTION 7 – INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES
The investment policies of the GLWA will be carried out by means of investment strategies that
reflect continuous evaluation of changing investment environments, judgment regarding the
allocation of the GLWA’s assets among different kinds of investment opportunities, identification
of appropriate investment vehicles, and the making of specific investment decisions.
The objective of the investments will be to provide for the GLWA’s continued operations on a
reasonably consistent basis and to achieve income and growth of principal without undue
exposure to risk. Therefore, the primary focus will be preservation of principal, income generation
and capital appreciation a secondary consideration together with the current spending
requirements and short and intermediate term capital requirements of GLWA. The Assets of GLWA
will be managed in accordance with the following objectives, in priority order:
A. Safety – Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the GLWA’s investment program.
Investments shall be undertaken in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in
the overall portfolio. The objective will be to mitigate risk.
1. Credit Risk – The GLWA will minimize credit risk, the risk of loss due to the failure of
the security issuer or backer, by:
i.

Limiting investments to the safest types of securities, and

ii. Pre‐qualifying the financial institutions, broker/dealers, and intermediaries
with which the GLWA will do business, and
iii. Diversifying the portfolio so that the potential losses on individual securities
will be minimized.

Approved by the GLWA Board on September 14, 2016

Page 3

Page 66

 2. Interest Rate Risk ‐ The GLWA will minimize the risk that market value of the
securities in the portfolio will fall due to changes in the general interest rates, by:
i.

Matching investments with anticipated short and long-term cash flow
requirements, and

ii. Minimizing the need to liquidate securities prior to maturity, and
iii. Monitoring the maturity dates of individual securities and the weighted
average maturity of the investment portfolio to ensure duration is
commensurate with the cash flow characteristics of the GLWA.
3. Custodial credit risk – The GLWA will minimize custodial risk by:
i.

Using only financial institutions and brokers meeting pre‐established criteria
and

ii. Holding all securities in the name of Great Lakes Water Authority.
B. Liquidity – The investment portfolio of the GLWA will remain sufficiently liquid to enable the
GLWA to meet all operating requirements that may be reasonably anticipated. Investment
maturities for operating funds shall be scheduled to coincide with projected cash flow needs,
taking into account large routine expenditures (such as payroll and debt service), as well as
considering sizable blocks of anticipated revenue (water and sewerage fee collections).
C. Return on Investments – The investment portfolio of the GLWA shall be designed and managed
with the objective of attaining a benchmark rate of return throughout the budgetary and
economic cycles, commensurate with GLWA’s investment risk constraints, operating cash flow
and long‐term capital needs. Portfolio performance will be measured against appropriate U.S.
Treasury benchmarks as noted in Section 14.
Securities shall generally be held until maturity with the following exceptions:
•
•
•

A security with declining credit may be sold early to minimize loss of principal;
Selling a security and reinvesting the proceeds that would improve the quality, yield,
or target duration in the portfolio may be undertaken;
Unanticipated liquidity needs of the portfolio require that the security be sold.

D. Diversification ‐ It is the policy of the GLWA to maintain a diversified investment portfolio.
Assets held in a common fund or concentration account and other investment funds will be
diversified to reduce the risk of loss resulting from over concentration of assets in a specific
maturity, individual financial institution(s) or a specific class of securities. Diversification
strategies will be determined and revised by the Treasury Manager, from time to time to meet
diversification objectives while seeking to attain market rates of return or the benchmark index
standards, set out herein.

Commented [A2]: Updated language from GFOA standards that
allows for sales for specific purposes within the overall investment
strategy.

It is also understood that temporary deviations from this objective may be necessary from
time to time in order to accommodate certain financial goals and obligations.
Approved by the GLWA Board on September 14, 2016

Page 67

 SECTION 8 – MAXIMUM MATURITIES
To the extent possible, investments should match anticipated short term and long-term cash flow
requirements. The weighted average maturity of the portfolio should not exceed five years. Unless
matched to a particular cash flow need, funds will not be directly invested in securities that exceed
five years maximum maturity period. Any longer duration investments must be matched to a
particular cash flow and must fall within the weighted average maturity guidelines for the portfolio.
SECTION 9 – AUTHORIZED FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND BROKER/DEALERS
A. The Treasury Manager shall maintain a listing of financial institutions and broker/dealers
authorized to provide investment services. The Treasury Manager will actively monitor and
will conduct a quarterly evaluation of each financial institution and broker/dealer for credit
worthiness to determine whether it should be on the “Qualified Institutions” listing. In
addition, the Treasury Manager shall also maintain also maintain a record of investment
policy certifications as shown at Addendum B from financial institutions and broker/dealers
with which it conducts business.
i.

For broker/dealers, the evaluation will include review of audited financial
statements, audited financial statements, proof of Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority (FINRA) registration, proof of approval to do business in Michigan,
evidence of adequate insurance coverage, review of bank ratings by at least two
independent sources, and certification of having read, understood, and agreeing to
comply with the GLWA investment policy. The authorized listing of financial
institutions, and / or broker/dealers shall be approved periodically by the Great
Lakes Water Authority Audit Committee or as may be amended.

ii.

For financial institutions, the evaluation will include review of audited financial
statements, proof of Michigan registration, evidence of adequate insurance
coverage, and review of bank ratings by at least two independent sources.

B. Any designated investment advisors assisting the GLWA in the management of its overall
portfolio may utilize their own approved list of broker/dealers to buy and sell investments
in accordance with this policy. The advisor’s list must be submitted to the Treasury
Manager on a quarterly basis in advance of utilization of those broker/dealers.
C. Whenever possible, all investment decisions should be made using a competitive bid
process. A competitive bid can be executed through a bidding process involving at least
three separate broker/dealers or financial institutions or through the use of a nationally
recognized trading platform. If a competitive quote is not available, the Treasury Manager
will document why the competitive bid process was not used and the process used to
make the investment decision.

 Glossary of Terms

Addendum C

Average Life
An estimate of the number of terms to maturity, taking the possibility of early payments into
account. Average life is calculated using the weighted average time to the receipt of all future cash
flows.
Agency Bond
A bond issued by a government sponsored enterprise (GSE) or agency. These bonds are not fully
guaranteed in the same way as U.S. Treasury and municipal bonds. Examples include Fannie Mae,
(FNMA) Federal National Mortgage Association; Freddie Mac (FHLMC) Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corporation, Sallie Mae Student Loan Marketing Association; Ginnie Mae (GNMA)
Government National Mortgage Association.
Asked
The price at which securities are offered.
Banker’s Acceptance (BA)
A draft or bill or exchange accepted by a bank or trust company. The accepting institution
guarantees payment of the bill, as well as the issuer. Acceptances are traded at a discount from
face value on the secondary market. Banker's acceptances are very similar to T‐bills and are often
used in money market funds.
Benchmark
A comparative base for measuring the performance of risk tolerance of the investment
portfolio. A benchmark should represent a close correlation to the level of risk and the average
duration of the portfolio’s investments.
Bid
The price offered by a buyer of securities. (When you are selling securities, you ask for a bid.)
Bond
A debt investment in which an investor loans money to an entity (corporate or governmental) that
borrows the funds for a defined period of time at a fixed interest rate. Bonds are used by companies,
municipalities, states and U.S. and foreign governments to finance a variety of projects and
activities.
Broker
A Broker brings buyers and sellers together for a commission
Certificate of Deposit
A time deposit with a specific maturity evidenced by a Certificate. Large denomination CDs are
typically negotiable.
Collateral
Securities, evidence of deposit or other property, which a borrower pledges to secure repayment of
a loan. Also refers to securities pledged by a bank to secure deposits.

 Collective Investment Fund
A fund that is operated by a trust company or a bank and handles a pooled group of trust accounts.
Collective investment funds combine the assets of various individuals and organizations to create a
larger, well‐diversified portfolio.
Commercial Paper
An unsecured, short‐term debt instrument issued by a corporation, typically for the financing of
accounts receivable, inventories and meeting short‐term liabilities. Maturities on commercial
paper rarely range any longer than 270 days. The debt is usually issued at a discount, reflecting
prevailing market interest rates.
Commercial paper is not usually backed by any form of collateral, so only firms with high‐quality
debt ratings will easily find buyers without having to offer a substantial discount (higher cost) for
the debt issue.
A major benefit of commercial paper is that it does not need to be registered with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) as long as it matures before nine months (270 days), making it a very
cost effective means of financing. The proceeds from this type of financing can only be used on
current assets (inventories) and are not allowed to be used on fixed assets, such as a new plant,
without SEC involvement.
Coupon
The annual rate of interest that a bond’s issuer promises to pay the bondholder on the bond’s face
value. Also a certificate attached to a bond evidencing interest due on a payment.
Dealer
A dealer, as opposed to a broker, acts as a principal in all transactions, buying and selling for their
own account.
Discount
The difference between the cost price of a security and its maturity when quoted at lower than face
value. A security selling below original offering price shortly after sale also is considered to be at a
discount.
Discount securities
Non‐interest bearing money market instruments that are issued at a discount and redeemed at
maturity for full face value, e.g. US Treasury Bills.
Diversification
Dividing investment funds among a variety of securities offering independent returns.
Delivery versus Payment – DVP
A securities industry procedure in which the buyer's payment for securities is due at the time of
delivery. Security delivery and payment are simultaneous. Also known as delivery against payment,
delivery against cash, or from the sell side.

 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)
A federal agency that insure bank deposits, currently up to $250,000 per deposit account. (If a
depositor wants an FDIC insured account, the desired bank must be a participant in the FDIC
program. Banks that are participants of the FDIC are required to display an official sign at each teller
window or station where deposits are regularly received. The maximum dollar amount that is
insured in a qualified account is $250,000 per bank. In other words, it is possible for a depositor to
deposit $1 million in four different banks and each account will be fully insured.) (The different
accounts that can be FDIC insured are NOW, checking, savings, Certificate of Deposits (CD) and
money market deposit accounts.)
Federal Funds Rate
The rate of interest at which Fed Funds are traded. The Federal Reserve through open‐market
operations currently pegs this rate.
Federal Open Market Committee
The branch of the Federal Reserve Board that determines the direction of monetary policy. The
FOMC is composed of the board of governors, which has seven members, and five reserve bank
presidents. The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York serves continuously, while the
presidents of the other reserve banks rotate their service of one‐year terms.
Federal Reserve System
The central bank of the United States created by Congress and consisting of a seven member Board
of Governors in Washington, D.C., twelve regional banks in major cities around the country.
Financial Institution
A state or nationally chartered bank or a state or federally chartered savings and loan association,
savings bank, or credit union whose deposits are insured by an agency of the United State
government that maintains a principal office or branch office located in this state under the laws
of this state of the United States.
Government-Sponsored Enterprise - GSE
Privately held corporations with public purposes created by the U.S. Congress to reduce the cost of
capital for certain borrowing sectors of the economy. Members of these sectors include students,
farmers and homeowners. GSEs carry the implicit backing of the U.S. Government, but they are not
direct obligations of the U.S. Government. For this reason, these securities will offer a yield
premium over Treasuries. Examples of GSEs include: Federal Home Loan Bank, Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), Federal Farm Credit Bank and the Resolution Funding
Corporation.
Investment Grade
A rating that indicates that a municipal or corporate bond has a relatively low risk of default. Bond
rating firms, such as Moody's, use different designations consisting of upper‐ and lower‐ case
letters 'A' and 'B' to identify a bond's credit quality rating. 'AAA' and 'AA' (high credit quality) and
'A' and 'BBB' (medium credit quality) are considered investment grade. Credit ratings for bonds
below these designations ('BB', 'B', 'CCC', etc.) are considered low credit quality, and are commonly
referred to as "junk bonds".

the asset's price. Liquidity is characterized by a high level of trading activity. Assets that can be
easily bought or sold are known as liquid assets. 2.) The ability to convert an asset to cash quickly,
also known as, "marketability".
Market Value

Master Trust
A collection of funds from individual investors that are pooled together in order to obtain wholesale
prices and rates unavailable for regular investors.
Master Repurchase Agreement

will often specify, among other things, the right of the buyer‐lender to liquidate the underlying
securities in the event of default by the seller‐borrower.
Maturity
The date upon which the principal or stated value of an investment becomes due and payable.
Money Market
A segment of the financial market in which financial instruments with high liquidity and very short
maturities are traded. The money market is used by participants as a means for borrowing and
lending in the short term, from several days to just under a year. Money market securities consist
of negotiable certificates of deposit (CDs), bankers’ acceptances, U.S. Treasury bills, commercial
paper, municipal notes, federal funds and repurchase agreements (repos).
Municipal Bond
A debt security issued by a state, municipality or county to finance its capital expenditures.
Municipal bonds are exempt from federal taxes and from most state and local taxes, especially if
you live in the state in which the bond is issued. At times taxable municipal bonds are issued to
finance a project or activity that does not provide a major benefit to the public. In such cases, the
federal government will not permit the tax‐exemption that is a prominent feature of most
municipal bonds.
Mutual Fund
An investment vehicle that is made up of a pool of funds collected from many investors for the
purpose of investing in securities such as, bonds, money market instruments and similar assets.
Mutual funds are operated by money managers, who invest the fund's capital and attempt to
produce capital gains and income for the fund's investors. A mutual fund's portfolio is structured
and maintained to match the investment objectives stated in its prospectus.
Each shareholder participates proportionally in the gain or loss of the fund. Mutual fund units, or
shares, are issued and can typically be purchased or redeemed as needed at the fund's current net
asset value (NAV) per share.

Open Market Operations
Purchases and sales of government and certain other securities in the open market by the New York
Federal Reserve Bank, as directed by the FOMC in order to influence the volume of money and credit

important and most flexible monetary policy tool.
Portfolio
Collection of securities held by an investor.
Rate of return
The gain or loss on an investment over a specified period, expressed as a percentage increase over
the initial investment cost. Gains on investments are considered to be any income received from
the security plus realized capital gains.

A form of short‐term borrowing for dealers in government securities. The dealer sells the
government securities to investors, usually on an overnight basis, and buys them back the following
day. For the party selling the security (and agreeing to repurchase it in the future) it is a repo; for
the party on the other end of the transaction, (buying the security and agreeing to sell in the future)
it is a reverse repurchase agreement.
Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC)
An agency created by Congress to protect investors in securities transactions by administering

When measuring performance, the actual rate of return of an investment or a pool of
investments over a given evaluation period. Total return includes interest, capital gains,
dividends and distributions realized over a given period of time.
Total return accounts for two categories of return: income and capital appreciation. Income
includes interest paid by fixed‐income investments, distributions or dividends. Capital appreciation
represents the change in the market price of an asset.

 Investment Performance Report – March 2018
Great Lakes Water Authority
Executive Summary

PORTFOLIO RECAP
¾ Safety – The aggregate portfolio is diversified amongst cash, bank deposits, U.S. Treasuries, Federal Agencies, commercial paper, SEC-registered
money market funds, and a local government investment pool. The overall credit profile of the pool is strong with over 98% of the assets invested in
bank deposits or securities that are rated within the two highest short and long-term rating classifications as established by Standard & Poor’s.
¾ Liquidity – The portfolio’s has slightly reduced its weighting to overnight funds from December, with about 54% of the total assets maturing overnight.
¾ Return – The overall yield increased to 1.72% as of March 31, 2018 versus 1.36% at December 31, 2017. The Authority has earned $8,907,945 in
investment income fiscal year-to-date on a book value basis. Based on the current interest rate environment, the investment income earned for the
prior quarter, and assuming that the Authority maintains the same investable balances for the remainder of the fiscal year, we are projecting that the
Authority will earn approximately $11.8 million in investment income for fiscal year 2018.
¾ Compliance – The aggregate portfolio is in compliance with the Authority’s investment policy and Michigan Public Act 20.

Investment Strategy

GLWA INVESTMENT STRATEGY
¾ The portfolio is in compliance with the Authority’s investment policy
¾ To date, the Authority has continued to invest its funds in a mixture of short and intermediate-term investments to ensure
sufficient liquidity
¾ The aggregate portfolio was yielding 1.72% at the end of March*
– This compares to the 1.61% yield of the Bank of America / Merrill Lynch 3-Month U.S. Treasury Bill Index as of
3/31/2018, which is a comparable market indicator
¾ The Authority continues to implement a disciplined investment plan to provide improved safety and diversification and putting
every dollar to work
¾ For the fourth quarter of FY 2018, the Authority has already taken initial steps to invest intermediate and longer-term funds
based on refined cash flows (specifically for the Water and Sewer Extraordinary Repair & Replacement Funds, the
Improvement & Extension Funds, and the Budget Stabilization Funds)
¾ The Authority will continue to work with its investment manager to refine its cash flows and identify strategies to maximize future
investment income while meeting the objectives of safety and liquidity
¾ Assuming that the Authority maintains the same investable balances for FY 2018 and FY 2019 and the interest rate
environment remains in a similar range, we conservatively expect to earn approximately $11.8 million in interest income in FY
2018 and over $14.0 million in FY 2019
* Current market yield as of March 31, 2018.

 Investment Performance Report – March 2018
Great Lakes Water Authority
Market Overview and Outlook

ECONOMIC HIGHLIGHTS UPDATE
¾ The markets have seen strong readings on the labor market, consumer and business confidence, and record
corporate profits
¾ Geopolitical concerns (e.g., North Korea, tariffs, and Russia) were seemingly pushed to the sidelines as interest rates
have risen to new cycle highs and equity prices rebounded from the volatile market conditions of earlier this year
¾ The Federal Reserve has indicated that it plans to increase interest rates two more times in 2018 to keep the
economy from overheating
PORTFOLIO RECAP SUMMARY
¾ The combination of two more expected Fed rate hikes in 2018, with the potential for additional increases following in
2019, supports the view that interest rates will trend higher over the near term; as a result, the Authority continues to
reap the rewards of current monetary policy tightening and higher overnight target rates
¾ With regards to the fixed-income sectors that the majority of the Authority’s debt funds and bond proceeds are invested
in, yields on high-quality commercial paper are attractive, especially in three to six-month maturities, while Treasury
Notes maturing inside of one year continue to fully compensate the Authority for multiple further hikes this year
¾ Concerning the Authority’s portfolios, with yields beginning to resume their climb, shorter maturity securities will be
favored in anticipation of continued interest rate increases by the Fed
¾ Portfolios will be managed in the near term to both mitigate interest rate risk and to position them for increased future
earnings from higher reinvestment rates
¾ The Fed’s actions going forward should lead to higher investment income for the Authority in the next fiscal year

The accounts at Comerica Bank get an earnings credit to offset bank fees. The earnings in the accounts at First Independence Bank is credited to the contractors and not the Authority. The funds in
the Flint Security Deposit account are held on behalf of the City of Flint and the earnings do not belong to GLWA. The Bank of America / Merrill Lynch 3-Month Treasury Bill is an unmanaged index
tracking the on-the-run Treasury Bill. The index is produced and maintained by Bank of America / Merrill Lynch & Co. YTM @ Cost is the expected return, based on the original cost, the annual
interest receipts, maturity value and the time period from purchase date to maturity, stated as a percentage, on an annualized basis. YTM @ Market is the rate of return, based on the current market
value, the annual interest receipts, maturity value and time period remaining until maturity, stated as a percentage, on an annualized basis.

 Investment Performance Report – March 2018
Great Lakes Water Authority
Demonstration of Yield to Maturity vs. Duration
As of March 31, 2018
¾ The comparison agencies included in the list below were selected based on type and/or other non-performance based criteria to show a broad
range of water entities/utilities. This peer group list does not represent an endorsement of any of the public agencies or their services. The types of
funds (e.g., bond proceeds, debt service, etc.) and duration of the overall portfolios listed below as well as the various differences in permitted
investments and allowable credit capacity in state statutes (i.e., the ability or non-ability to invest in long-term corporate credit) will have a direct
impact on the corresponding yields at market.
¾ The overall yield of the Authority’s aggregate portfolio compares favorably to those of other short-term indices (i.e., the S&P LGIP index and the 3month U.S. Treasury index).
¾ The Authority does not have a potential for a longer duration portfolio when compared to other similar water entities/utilities as the Authority’s
covenants limits and restricts its ability in managing assets to a longer-term strategy.

* The Authority generally does not realize losses on its investments. However, on March 9, 2018, PFM purchased a 6-month commercial paper investment,
thinking that the amount could be fully invested to the October 1st payment date. Upon reviewing the Sewage SRF Debt Service account with the Authority
in mid-March, it was determined that the amount necessary for the April 1st payment was different from what PFM had previously calculated. Therefore, a
portion of the commercial paper investment was sold to ensure that the required liquid funds were available on the April 1st payment date.

These figures are based upon actual interest earned and posted to the Authority’s various accounts via book value and does not include any earnings credit rate tied to the Authority’s bank deposits.

 Investment Performance Report – March 2018
Great Lakes Water Authority
Market Overview and Outlook

FIXED INCOME MARKET – ECONOMIC HIGHLIGHTS
¾ The laundry list of positive economic data is long and remains a key driver of economic growth, consumer confidence, and
business optimism
– GDP posted an upward revision to fourth quarter 2017 GDP to 2.9%
– Estimates for 2018 GDP call for growth in the range of 2.7% to 2.8%
– Job growth continued to be strong, averaging over 200,000 new jobs per month in the first quarter of 2018
– The unemployment rate remained at 4.1%, a 17-year low
– Productivity hit a 2-year high
– Manufacturing reached a 3-year high
– Consumer confidence rebounded after a dampened fourth quarter of 2017 and now sits at a 14-year high
– Inflation, while below the Fed’s target of 2.0%, inched higher by most measures
¾ New Fed Chair Jerome Powell made his first public address at February’s semi-annual monetary policy report to Congress.
His maiden testimony hinted at a continuance of gradual rate hikes, while acknowledging that “the economic outlook remains
strong” and the expectation for inflation to increase and closely approach the FOMC’s 2.0% objective remains intact
¾ The Fed remained true to its stated course, raising short-term rates by 0.25% in March, and interest rates continued their
ascent over the quarter. As a result, we strategically positioned portfolios with a defensive duration bias relative to
benchmarks to help insulate market values in the well-choreographed interest rate environment. However, with rates at or
near multi-year highs, there were also opportunities to capture higher yields selectively in some parts of the yield curve when
rebalancing portfolios.

 Investment Performance Report – March 2018
Great Lakes Water Authority
Market Overview and Outlook

FIXED INCOME MARKET – ECONOMIC HIGHLIGHTS
¾ The combined effects of less predictable U.S. politics and policy (e.g., tariffs, trade wards, Facebook, global relations, budget
deficits, etc.) created a market environment of heightened volatility. The “risk off” sentiment triggered wider credit spreads.
– Federal Agency yield spreads remained very narrow throughout the quarter. New issue Agencies continued to be
our preferred – in some cases only – outlet to add exposure at relatively attractive yields. Generally, the Agency
sector added modest positive excess returns in the first quarter of 2018 (returns in excess of similar duration
Treasuries) across much of the yield curve, benefitting portfolio performance.
– After yield spreads in the commercial paper sector reached another new post-recession low in January, we shifted
our generally constructive view of the CP sector to a slightly more defensive posture by holding current positions
(and letting them drift shorter over time) rather than adding to allocations. In the latter half of the quarter, the story
shifted abruptly as market volatility pushed credit spreads markedly wider through quarter-end. As a result, we
began to add credit exposure more aggressively
¾ The economic themes that carried over into 2018 remain: healthy job production, consistent GDP growth, positive corporate
guidance, and heightened consumer confidence. However, where complacency had characterized the global markets
quarter after quarter, volatility roared back in the first quarter of 2018. While rising volatility increases some market risks, it
can also create investment opportunities.
¾ The outlook for some of the major investment-grade fixed-income sectors are as follows:
– Federal Agency securities remain expensive, as spreads are in the low single digits across much of the yield curve;
however, by quarter-end, specific Agency maturities (2 and 5-year) cheapened modestly, representing an opportunity
to potentially increase allocations.
– The short-term credit curve (under one year) steepened noticeably heading into the March Fed meeting and
remained elevated through quarter-end. With 6-month prime commercial paper spreads at 50 to 60 basis points
over comparable Treasury securities, the sector appears very attractive and compensates investors for at least two
more Fed rate hikes in 2018.

for billing activities for the City of Detroit retail customer class. All revenues collected by both
GLWA and DWSD are deposited in a trust account in accordance with the GLWA Master Bond
Ordinance.

Table 1 summarizes the unaudited FY 2018 billed revenues through May 31, 2018 and do not

month that the billed flow was accrued and not the following month when the bills are usually
sent out to customers.

 AGENDA ITEM #8D

Date:   July 20, 2018 
To: 

Great Lakes Water Authority Audit Committee 

From:  Kim Garland, Public Finance Management Professional   
Re:  

Trust Receipt & Disbursement Report for Activity through May 31, 2018 

Background:  The trusts established pursuant to the Master Bond Ordinance (MBO) 
outline a flow of funds that governs the priority of the application of cash receipts from 
both the regional wholesale (i.e. Great Lakes Water Authority or GLWA) and local retail (i.e. 
Detroit Water & Sewerage Department) activities which are further separated by the water 
system and the sewage disposal system.1  
The purpose of this report is to provide an ongoing status of the net cash flow of both 
organizations (GLWA and DWSD) to fund their allocated share of Master Bond Ordinance 
requirements in accordance with the leases for the regional systems.  This report begins 
with the operational effective date of the GLWA on January 1, 2016.   
Analysis:  The attached tables summarize activity along three lines:  Local System Activity, 
Regional System Activity, and Combined Activity accompanied by a series of charts that 
further breakdown this activity by fund, inflows, and outflows.   
Although the collection rate between water and sewer vary slightly each month, there is 
overall consistency in cash receipts between the regional and local systems.  The local 
sewage disposal (sewer) system shortfall continues to be tempered through use of the 
sewer lease payment to offset allocated debt obligations.  Overall, the combined systems 
report a modest gain in the surplus of receipts over Operations & Maintenance and Master 
Bond Ordinance obligations for the period.  Discussions continue regarding plans to 
address the local sewer system shortfall. 
Proposed Action:  Receive and file report.

AGENDA ITEM #7D

Date: July 20, 2018
To:

Great Lakes Water Authority Audit Committee

From: Nicolette N. Bateson, CPA, Chief Financial Officer/Treasurer
Re:

Cash Analysis – Long-term Planning

Background: Over the past several months, the Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA)
Audit Committee has been presented with various analysis as we work through the longterm financial plan to ensure sustainability (i.e. the FY 2030 Plan).

Analysis: Key elements of the financial plan are reducing GLWA’s long-term financial
obligations, proactively addressing financial commitments to the Detroit General
Retirement System, and a balanced debt vs. pay-as-you-go capital financing program while
preserving the commitment to an annual revenue requirement ceiling of 4%.

This month, we would like to review GLWA’s cash balances, restrictions on those balances,
and potential priorities for the use of cash for future capital investment as well as reducing
long-term liabilities. Attached for this discussion are 1) the FY 2017 cash and investment
footnote noting restrictions and 2) and analysis from The Foster Group based upon an
internal, preliminary FY 2018 analysis calculating similar cash balance restrictions.
Proposed Action: Receive and file report.

MEMORANDUM
GLWA Cash and Investment Balance Review
To:

July 20, 2018

Nicolette Bateson

From: Bart Foster
You have asked for preliminary observations regarding estimated unrestricted GLWA cash
and investment balances. The attached exhibits summarize our initial analysis, which supports
the next iteration of the scenario projections we prepared and discussed at the May Audit
Committee meeting. Those initial projections utilized audited FY 2017 information for
available cash and investment balances and explored policy decisions regarding ongoing
application of such balances. This analysis evaluates preliminary FY 2018 cash and investment
balances and further explores policy considerations regarding use of those balances.
As we have explored in prior discussions with the Audit Committee, analyses of the adequacy
of cash and investment balances are often evaluated via a “days cash on hand” metric.
Schedules included in the GLWA audited financial statements include evaluation of this metric
utilizing actual audited operating expense as a measure of “days” of required operating
expense. We believe that this approach is appropriate for purposes of establishing peer
comparisons, etc. However, we submit that for purposes of evaluating policy decisions for
financial planning the appropriate relative operating expense metric is budgeted operating
expense, and that this amount should include the operating portion of the legacy pension
reimbursement – as long as such amounts are considered an “operating expense” in the various
guiding documents and requirements. This approach is outlined on Lines 1 through 3 of the
attached exhibit. In essence, the approved FY 2019 Budget establishes a “daily operating cash
requirement” of approximately $349,600 for the Water System and $553,200 for the Sewer
System.
On Line 4 of the exhibit, we have presented the reported (for FY 2017, as reflected in the
audited financial statements) and estimated (for FY 2018, unaudited) cash and investment
balances in the “unrestricted” GLWA funds and accounts. On Lines 5 through 8, we
“designate” application of these available balances to specific Funds established by the Master
Bond Ordinance, in accordance with our understanding of current GLWA policy positions. A
brief introduction:

Line 5 - Designated to O&M Minimum Balance: We first designate 120 days of
budgeted operating expense as a minimum allocation to the O&M Fund for “working
capital purposes.
o The 120 days aligns with our understanding of current GLWA management
policy positions.
Line 6 – Designated to ER&R Balance: We next designate balances to the current
policy position on the minimum ER&R balances.
o These balances were established as part of the recent GLWA / DWSD
discussions that resulted in the 2018 MOU.
Line 7 - Designated to Minimum I&E Balance: We next designate balances to the
current policy position regarding carryover balances for each GLWA I&E Fund.
o As noted in our May scenario planning analyses, the preliminary policy
position establishes a minimum carryover balance of $90 million for each
system.
Line 8 - The remaining “unrestricted” cash and investment balances that are
“undesignated” amounts available to the Water and Sewer Systems.
o Based on the assumptions above, our analysis results in estimated 6/30/18
“undesignated” cash and investment balances equating to an adjusted
“undesignated days cash on hand” metric of 440 for the Water System and 14
for the Sewer System.

The estimated 6/30/18 amounts shown on Line 8 ($153.8 million for Water and $7.7 million
for Sewer) are intended to reflect estimated “undesignated liquidity” balances that can be
directed towards cash financing of capital improvements or other financing purposes.
Obviously changing the assumptions regarding policy decisions outlined herein would result
in alternative “undesignated” balances.
We are prepared to elaborate on our initial analysis at the July 20 Audit Committee Meeting
and to further discuss this matter at your convenience.

 AGENDA ITEM #7E

Date: July 20, 2018
To:

Great Lakes Water Authority Audit Committee

From: Lisa Mancini, Interim Financial Planning & Analysis Manager
Re:

Financial Reporting Schedule and Planning Calendar

Background & Analysis: The Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA) Financial Services
Area is working toward a standard, comprehensive monthly reporting package which will
be presented at the monthly Audit Committee Meetings beginning in August 2018. This
package will include, but not be limited to, the following information.

 Financial Statements (including a crosswalk from revenue requirement basis to
accrual basis of monthly financial activity)
 Budget to Actual Analysis (including operating area input)
 Revenue Billings and Collections Report
 Cash Inflows/Outflows Report
 Treasury Report

 Construction Work in Progress Summary

Attached is a timeline for the creation and distribution of the consolidated report.

In addition to the monthly reporting of FY 2019 activity, as described above, work has begun
on the development of the FY 2020 through FY 2024 Financial Plan which includes the FY
2020 & FY 2021 Biennial Budget and Five-year Financial Plan, the Five-year Capital
Improvement Plan (CIP), and the Schedule of Revenues and Charges. The following are key
dates in the development and presentation of the FY 2020 through FY 2024 Financial Plan.
Customer Charges Work Group Meetings (previously posted on the Outreach calendar)
 October 25, 2018 – Rollout Meeting #1: Capital Improvement Plan (CIP)
 November 29, 2018 – Rollout Meeting #2: Units of Service

Page 6

  January 10, 2019 – Rollout Meeting #3: Proposed FY 2020 Revenue Requirements
(FY 2020 through FY 2024 Budget/Financial Plan)
 January 24, 2019 – Rollout Meeting #4: Propose FY 2020 Service Charges

The above sequence of meetings will allow for the Public Hearing to be held during the Board
of Directors meeting which will take place in February 2019 (date to be determined). During
this meeting the key sections of the FY 2020 through FY 2024 Financial Plan (Revenue
Requirements, CIP, and Service Charges) will be presented with the proposal of adoption.

The timing of the Board meeting is important to meet the following applicable statutory and
contractual requirements.
A. Uniform Budgeting and Accounting Act, Act 2 of 1968, Section 141.434, “Before
final passage of a general appropriations act by the legislative body, a public hearing
shall be held as required by 1963 (2nd Ex Sess) PA 43, MCL 141.411 to 141.415, and
the open meetings act, 1976 PA 267, MCL 15.261 to 15.275.” (For purposes of
Public Act 2, the GLWA Board is the legislative body.)

B. Home Rule City Act, Act 279 of 1909, Section 117.5e, “Municipal water or sewage
system; annual audit; public hearing before proposed rate increase. A municipal
water or sewage system established by a city incorporated under this act which
serves more than 40% of the population of the state shall: ….(b) Hold at least 1
public hearing at least 120 days before a proposed rate increase is scheduled to take
effect. …A final vote by the governing body of the city to implement a proposed rate
increase shall not be taken until the hearings provided for in this subdivision are
concluded and the results of those hearings are considered by the city's governing
body.” (Emphasis added)
It should be noted that the Home Rule City Act does not apply to GLWA. It is
relevant to GLWA’s planning cycle, however, as it is referenced in the Wholesale
Customer Model Water Contract as noted below.

C. GLWA Wholesale Customer Model Water Contract Section 7.02 provides:
“Notification of Rates. As soon as possible in the ratemaking process, the Board
shall provide information on proposed rates and the draft data and information
used in the calculation of proposed rates in a format that will enable Customer to
assist in the ratemaking process. Not less than thirty calendar days prior to the
hearing required by Act 279, the Board shall provide Customer with written notice
of a proposed rate and the underlying data used to calculate the rate. The Board

Page 7

 shall meet with Customer to review the rate and the data.” (Emphasis added; Act
279 is the Home Rule City Act noted above.)

Proposed Action: Receive and file report.

Great Lakes Water Authority Audit Committee

From: Nicolette N. Bateson, CPA, Chief Financial Officer/Treasurer
Re:

Proposed Audit Fee Change Order for the FY 2017 Audit

Background: The firm of Rehmann Robson was selected as auditors for the Great Lakes
Water Authority (GLWA) in January 2017.

Analysis: The audit for FY 2017 was started in October 2017. Audit fieldwork and draft
financial statements were largely completed in November 2017. Concurrently, discussions
related to a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Detroit Water & Sewerage
Department (DWSD) were underway. While it was anticipated that there would be a
financial impact, the dollar amount was not determinable until April 2018 when the boards
for both entities approved an MOU Term Sheet. The technical nature of the MOU,
inefficiencies from the delay, and related additional effort by all parties translate into a
reasonable request by Rehmann Robson for additional compensation. Attached is an
analysis from the auditors providing an additional request for $48,500 which is net of a
negotiated discount of 7.5%.

Budget Impact: To the extent that there are not savings in the Financial Reporting &
Accounting cost center, a budget amendment from unallocated reserve would be required.
There are sufficient funds in that budget reserve.
Proposed Action: Move that the Audit Committee recommends that the Board of
Directors of the Great Lakes Water Authority approve a change order for audit services
contract with Rehmann Robson in the amount of $48,500 for the FY 2017 audit.

Fees for Fiscal 2017 Audit Incremental Work/ Rework

Going into the fiscal 2017 audit, we had anticipated a much smoother process than the prior year initial
audit, and that was indeed the case through the first two months of the year-end fieldwork, which
began in late October. it then became apparent prior to the end of the calendar year (and leading up to
the State?s original six month reporting deadline) that an extension would be necessary to address
Director Daddow?s "Current and Legacy Business Issues? and allow for the negotiations with 
to resolve various lease issues (most of which were highlighted in Director Daddow?s Current and Legacy
Business Issues).

Taking a lesson from the prior audit, we separately coded our time to distinguish the regular audit tasks
from the extra work/rework to specifically identify the out-of-scope work (or additional time for the
incremental work for the meetings, conference calls, workpaper changes, report changes and other
work/rework caused by the ?issues? and MOU). That detail is attached along with a summary.

Per the attached, we identified approximately 150 hours (heavily skewed towards partner/principal time
given the nature of the tasks, with the remainder being manager time) of out-of?scope work time for
fees of approximately $52,400 including expenses. We would propose a discount of roughly 7.5% to a
rounded amount of $48,500. Accordingly, we request approval of this amount.

 AGENDA ITEM #7I

Date: July 20, 2018
To:

Great Lakes Water Authority Audit Committee

From: Jon Wheatley, Public Finance Manager
Re:

Update: Drinking Water Revolving Fund (DWRF) Project Plan Submittals for the
Lake Huron Water Treatment Plant Sludge System Improvements Project and the
Waterworks Park to Northeast Transmission Main Project

Background: The Great Lakes Water Authority (the “GLWA”) has identified two water
system projects in the proposed FY 2019 to FY 2023 Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) for
submittal to the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) for the DWRF
financing program for funding in the state’s 2019 fiscal year. Public hearings were held for
both projects on April 11, 2018 and both were approved by the GLWA Board of Directors at
its meeting later that day. Both project plans were submitted to MDEQ by the July 1, 2018
deadline.
On July 18, 2018, GLWA received notification from MDEQ that both the Lake Huron Water
Treatment Plant Sludge System Improvements (DWRF Project #7446-01) and the Water
Conveyance System – Waterworks Park to Northeast Transmission Main Project (DWRF
Project #7445-01) projects were within the fundable range for the states FY 2019. Final
project milestone schedules have not been determined for either project.

At the April 20, 2018 GLWA Audit Committee meetings, GLWA had presented information
on the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) program which is
administered by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). This program
provides funding for large water and sewer projects at an interest rate that is lower than
traditional revenue bonds. The deadline for submitting letters of intent for the next
funding cycle is July 31, 2018. GLWA had originally identified the Water Conveyance
System – Waterworks Park to Northeast Transmission Main Project as a candidate for this
program to cover eligible costs that were not funded through the DWRF. Since MDEQ has
indicated the entire project will be in the fundable range, then GLWA will not be pursuing
WIFIA funding since the DWRF program interest rate is lower.
The Projects: Lake Huron Water Treatment Plant Sludge System Improvements – (CIP#
111007): The project is comprised of the evaluation, design, and construction of the Raw
Sludge Clarifiers and Raw Sludge Pumping Systems at the Lake Huron Water Treatment
Plant (LHWTP). Constructed in 1976, the LHWTP is a Type I public water system that
1

Page 15

 supplies water to residential, commercial, and industrial customers in GLWA’s Northern
communities. The LHWTP uses source water drawn from a single intake located in Lake
Huron. There are major issues associated with the sludge handling system at the LHWTP
as it relates to the twice annual cleaning of the settling basins. This project is necessary to
ensure that GLWA can maintain treatment of flows at the LHWTP without system failure.

The proposed project will provide construction of a new redundant wash water retention
basin and a new sludge pumping station with the existing clarifiers being abandoned or
demolished. Additionally, provisions for decanting clear water from Lagoon 5 and Lagoon
6 to Lagoon 8 so Lagoon 8 can serve as temporary overflow storage during basin cleanout
are included within the scope of this project. These improvements and modifications are
detailed in the Project Plan. The estimated cost of the project is $7,250,000.

Water Conveyance System – Waterworks Park to Northeast Transmission Main Project(CIP# 122003): The primary purpose of the project is to better align the GLWA water
production capacity with long-term system water demands, while improving reliability,
water quality protection and reducing future operational and maintenance costs as well as
capital improvement costs.

The intent of the project is to provide finished water to the NE site from WWP through a
proposed transmission pipeline such that treatment facilities at the NE site can be decommissioned and the existing NE high lift station and reservoirs can be used to re-pump
finished water to the NE service area. The proposed NE Repurposing will largely eliminate
the need to complete the large and costly backlog of capital improvement projects at the NE
site with the goal of long term capital cost savings. In addition to NE repurposing, the
project is also intended to provide additional reliability to the WWP service area through
the proposed transmission pipeline in case of loss of service at the WWP. The project is
comprised of the final design and construction of a new transmission main, isolation valves,
control valves, and related appurtenances to provide a design flow rate of 160 million
gallons per day (MGD) of finished drinking water from Waterworks Park WTP to the
Northeast facility. These improvements and modifications are detailed in the Project Plan.
The estimated cost of this project is $133,700,000.

Justification: GLWA is seeking low interest loan assistance through the DWRF program
for both projects. Although the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ)
interest rate for FY 2019 will not be determined until October 2018, the current year’s
interest rate of 2.00% is less than the present conventional revenue bond interest rates.
Based on the combined project amounts of $140.9 million, GLWA could save an estimated
$92 million in interest costs and avoided issuance costs, based on a similar open market
revenue bond with a 30-year term and 5.00% interest rate, over the life of the 30-year
bond issue. This will afford savings to both GLWA and its members.

Page 16

 Budget Impact: Debt service is anticipated to begin in FY 2020 for both projects and will
be included as part of the FY 2020 financial plan.
Proposed Action: Receive and file report.
