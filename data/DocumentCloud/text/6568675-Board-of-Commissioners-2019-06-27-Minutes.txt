In Fiscal Year 2019, the Department of Transportation and Highways was advised of the need to add an
additional account series in the FY 2019 Chart of Accounts for Non-Capitalizable expenses. The
Department of Transportation and Highways requests to transfer our FY 2019 approved MFT funds to
the new series of expense accounts for the proper capture of the expenditures for Non-Capitalizable

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
The account was used for various CIP Projects
Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from.

COUNTY COMMISSIONERS
RESOLUTION IN SUPPORT OF H.R. 1384 - THE MEDICARE FOR ALL ACT
WHEREAS, the United States (U.S.) spends nearly twice as much per capita on health care as all other
comparable countries and yet ranks only 35th in the world by global health standards, including on such
critical barometers as average life expectancy, infant mortality, maternal mortality, and death from
preventable diseases; and
WHEREAS, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) enacted important improvements, primarily through the
expansion of Medicaid in states that have agreed to do so, and limits on some insurance industry abuses,
that reform left tens of millions with a continuing crisis in access, cost, and quality of care; and
WHEREAS, the uninsured rate for U.S. adults has risen for four (4) straight years up to nearly 30 million,
even after implementation of the ACA, with the greatest increase among women, young adults, and lowerincome people; and
WHEREAS, tens of millions more who pay for insurance remain underinsured due to the still largely
unregulated high cost of medical care that has led to one-third of all GoFundMe accounts being established
to pay for exorbitant medical bills; and
WHEREAS, more than 40 percent of all U.S. adults under the age of 65 forego needed medical care, 30
percent fail to fill a prescription or take less than the recommended dose, and a third said they had to choose
in the past year between paying for food, heating, housing, or health care, according to a 2018 survey by
the West Health Institute and NORC at the University of Chicago; and
WHEREAS, the inability to pay medical bills continues to be a leading cause of personal bankruptcy, and
people who need medical care should never face bankruptcy as a result of needing care; and
WHEREAS, the ever-rising cost of health care and its discriminatory characteristics contribute to the
growing national chasm in wealth inequality; and
WHEREAS, discrimination, based on race, ethnicity, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age,
socioeconomic status, and where one lives is particularly systematic to a profit-based health care system;
and
135

 Board of Commissioners

Journal of Proceedings

June 27, 2019

WHEREAS, 55 percent of the uninsured are people of color; African Americans suffer higher death rates
than whites at an earlier age due to heart disease, diabetes, cancer, HIV, and infant mortality; AfricanAmerican women are three to four times more likely than white women to die in childbirth; and AfricanAmerican and Latino students are more likely to experience health risks due to exposure to toxins and air
pollution at school; and
WHEREAS, continued attacks on the ACA by the Trump administration and GOP in Congress have given
insurance companies a new pretext to demand double-digit premium increases, while the government’s
failure to maintain taxpayer subsidies to help moderate-income families pay the high cost of insurance plans
has exacerbated the crisis experienced by millions of American families; and
WHEREAS, employer-provided health benefits are declining and employees’ costs are increasing through
cost-shifting to workers, including increased cost of premiums for workers covered by employer-paid
insurance, which have risen by an average of 65 percent, and deductibles have risen by an average of 212
percent over the past decade; and
WHEREAS, many other countries around the world use taxes to pay for national universal health care,
which leaves U.S. based companies that pay for employee health care at a competitive disadvantage; and
WHEREAS, due to their profit incentive, private insurance companies deny up to one-fourth of all claims
for care and restrict patient choice through narrow networks for doctors and hospitals, limited drug
formularies, and other limits in coverage; and
WHEREAS, the United States ranks first in cost, but only 35th among countries of the world in health
system outcomes and quality according to the Lancet and worse for infant mortality and life expectancy,
with no relationship between what health care costs in the United States and the quality of care or access to
care; and
WHEREAS, the Medicare for All Act, H.R. 1384, would:
•

Establish guaranteed, universal health care for all U.S. residents

•

Provide comprehensive health care, including all primary care, hospital and outpatient services,
dental, vision, audiology, maternity and newborn care, women’s reproductive services, mental
health, prescription drugs, and long-term care services

•

Eliminate all costs for premiums, deductibles, copays, and other out-of- pocket costs that have
caused such a crisis for tens of millions of people

•

Ensure genuine patient choice of any doctor, hospital, clinic, or other provider a patient chooses
without the restrictions imposed by private insurers

•

Sharply reduce the cost of prescription drugs by authorizing Medicare to negotiate lower drug
prices as most of the rest of the world does

•

Protect the ability of service veterans to continue to receive their specialized care through the
Veterans Administration if they choose, and Native Americans to receive their medical benefits
136

Journal of Proceedings

through the Indian Health Service if they choose; and
WHEREAS nearly all U.S. residents and businesses would spend less, and usually far less, under a
Medicare for All program, such as H.R. 1384, than they do today for health coverage and medical, dental,
vision, and other care; and
WHEREAS, various studies, both conservative and progressive, have estimated that the U.S. would save
from $2 trillion to $5 trillion over 10 years over what our country is projected to spend under the current
system, due to massive savings in administration costs, lower prescription drug prices, and improved
efficiency through a uniform payment system with global budgeting - without the waste for billing,
marketing, profit-taking; and
WHEREAS, the Medicare for All Act, H.R. 1384, would establish a system of public financing that retains
the private provider system with real patient choice and greater transparency on how our public dollars are
spent; and
WHEREAS public opinion polls show up to 70 percent public support for a Medicare for All/single-payer
health care system and for the government to guarantee health care for all people living in the United States;
and
WHEREAS, the Medicare for All Act, H.R. 1384, would establish peace of mind for everyone, relieving
worry about medical bills and access to needed care through a humane system based on patient need, not
ability to pay.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that Cook County affirms that health care is a human right
that should be guaranteed to all U.S. residents; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that Cook County endorses H.R. 1384, the Medicare for All Act that
will expand health coverage and health security, eliminate health disparities, and lower health care costs
for all of our community residents.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
REQUESTING A HEARING OF THE HEALTH AND HOSPITALS COMMITTEE OF THE
COOK COUNTY BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS TO DISCUSS THE PRACTICES OF COOK
COUNTY HEALTH (CCH) RELATED TO COUNTYCARE FINANCES AS DISCUSSED IN THE
INDEPENDENT INSPECTOR GENERAL REPORT (IIG 18-0100)
WHEREAS, in 2012, the State of Illinois obtained a federal Section 1115 demonstration waiver to get an
early start on Medicaid expansion as a result of provisions in the Affordable Care Act, which allowed adults
living in Cook County and making less than roughly $15,860 (or 133% below the federal poverty level) to
get Medicaid; and
WHEREAS, the initiative was named “CountyCare” and was designed to help the state and CCH build
capacity and experience to support implementation of the official Medicaid expansion in January 2014, as
more than 618,000 uninsured adults were estimated to be eligible for the ACA’s Medicaid expansion in
Illinois, with over 341,000 of them residing in Cook County; and
WHEREAS, as part of this initiative CountyCare had to handle management of its waiver from the Centers
for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and needed a third party to evaluate the effectiveness of the waiver
showing that it enrolled enough patients; that those patients were geographically acceptable enough to
encourage providers to participate in the plan; and showing that CountyCare could deliver and generate
enough medically necessary claims processed through the state Medicaid agency; and
WHEREAS, the program is considered crucial to the financial survival of the health system, and to the
county itself, which subsidizes the system with tax dollars; Before CountyCare, the system historically had
been spending $500 million to $600 million a year for uncompensated care; and
WHEREAS, in 2014, CountyCare transformed its health plan to also accept traditional Medicaid
populations and as a result is now one of the largest Medicaid managed health plans in the State;
CountyCare currently has a healthcare network of approximately 4,500 primary care providers, 15,000
specialists, 50 hospitals, and 335,000 Members; and
WHEREAS, on June 21st, 2019, the Office of the Independent Inspector General (OIIG) released a report
on CountyCare Healthcare Expenses (IIG 18-0100), which was prompted after receiving information during
the course of their review of CCH bad debt expense and claim denials; and
168

 Board of Commissioners

Journal of Proceedings

June 27, 2019

WHEREAS, the OIIG report identified key managerial decisions and financial policies associated with
large volumes of unpaid healthcare expenses related to the CountyCare program including outstanding
liabilities of $701 million for the 2018 fiscal year-end compared to the small amounts the State tends to
owe CountyCare at the end of the year and according to the report can only pay 2% of the outstanding
liabilities; and
WHEREAS, according to the report, CountyCare does not generate enough revenue to pay all the
outstanding healthcare expenses at the end of the fiscal year and has a practice of using subsequent period
budgetary funds to pay prior period bills, such that CountyCare's unpaid healthcare expenses are steadily
growing and could become too large to pay without an extraordinary contribution from another funding
source in the future; and
WHEREAS, the report further states that CCH routinely changes revenue and expense figures between
CCH's operating units (e.g., Stroger, CountyCare, etc.) to reach desired financial goals for CountyCare and
Stroger Hospital in CCH's monthly and annual financial reports, and as a result, these practices make it
difficult for the CCH Board and Cook County Board of Commissioners to have a sound baseline to evaluate
the performance of the individual operating units that make-up CCH; and
WHEREAS, CCH has stated that they are absolutely confident in the integrity of the CountyCare program
and will respond in a comprehensive manner in time; and
WHEREAS, with the FY2020 budget process already started, the time is now to address this report and
provide answers to the Board and the Public;
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners does hereby
request that a meeting of the Health and Hospitals Committee be convened to discuss the CountyCare
program and financial and reporting practices of Cook County Health as it relates said program; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the OIIG appear before the Committee and be prepared to explain
its review of CountyCare, CCH, and the five report recommendations; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Chief Financial Officer and any other pertinent representatives
of Cook County Health, as well as the Independent Hospital Board appear before the Committee and be
prepared to update the Committee on the contents of the OIIG report and the relationship between
CountyCare and CCH, and be prepared to answer questions on the same.
