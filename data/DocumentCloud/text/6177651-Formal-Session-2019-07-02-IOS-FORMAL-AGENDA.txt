MEMORANDUM

TO: Kimberly Hall-Wagner, Director
Human Resources Policy Flaming and Operations

FROM: Roy McCalister, Member
Detroit City Council
DATE: June 26, 2019
RE: Questions regarding Contract 6001075

 

Regarding these transportation services, why did the appropriation for this contract run out of money in January
of this year?

And given the shortfall in funding, will this proposed extension be enough to fund the service through June 30,
2020?

What kind of evaluation or analysis of this service has been done as to date to justify a contract extension?

Our of?ce would also like to be provided a list of City Departments that provide ?mding in exchange for these
services.

Sincerely,
Roy McCalister, Jr.
