ITEM NO. C3

September 15, 2010

RECOMMENDATION TO APPROVE THE FY2010 ADMISSIONS AND CONTINUED
OCCUPANCY POLICY AND RESIDENTIAL LEASE AGREEMENT
To the Honorable Board of Commissioners:
RECOMMENDATION
It is recommended that the Board of Commissioners approve the FY2010 Admissions and Continued
Occupancy Policy (ACOP) and Residential Lease Agreement (Lease). It is further recommended that
the Board of Commissioners authorize the Chief Executive Officer, or his designee to approve any
final changes to such FY2010 ACOP and Lease, including but not limited to, changes based on HUD
requirements or changes, if any, resulting from any applicable future notice and public comment
period.
FUNDING
N/A
EXPLANATION
The FY2010 ACOP amends the September 2009 Board of Commissioners approved ACOP and the
FY2010 Lease amends the September 2009 Board approved Lease. Changes are being made to the
ACOP and Lease to ensure that the language conforms to federal law, federal regulations, and state
law. In summary, the new requirement is as follows:
In accordance with 24 CFR 5.216, 24 CFR 5.218, and 24 CFR 5.233, all
Applicants and Residents are required to disclose Social Security Numbers or
make a declaration, under penalties of perjury, that they do not have a Social
Security Number.
The FY2010 ACOP and Lease also clarifies the definition of Total Tenant Payment (TTP) and
Minimum Rent. The minimum TTP shall be $75 per month. Whenever the TTP calculation results in an
amount less than $75, the CHA will impose a TTP of $75.

CHA presented key changes in the FY2010 ACOP to the Central Advisory Council (CAC) Executive
Board and the council at large and their legal representatives on March 25, 2010. The proposed
changes to the FY2010 ACOP were also presented to CHA executive staff, department directors, and
assistant directors for review. Notice to residents and the public about the public comment period and
hearing appeared in news ads in the Chicago Sun-Times, Chicago Defender, and El Dia on March 16
and 17, 2010. The public comment period for the draft FY2010 ACOP was held March 17, 2010
through April 15, 2010. A public comment hearing was held on March 29, 2010, at the Charles Hayes
Family Investment Center. In finalizing the proposed amendment to the FY2010 ACOP, CHA gave
consideration to comments received during the public comment period and public comment hearing.
Based upon the foregoing, it is in the best interest of CHA to approve the FY2010 Admission and
Continued Occupancy Policy and Residential Lease Agreement.
