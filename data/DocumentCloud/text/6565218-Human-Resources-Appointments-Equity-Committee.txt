Bernie Mereno President, Bernie Moreno Companies

It?s been only a decade?and?a-half since Bernie Moreno arrived in Northeast Ohio. Yet in that relatively short amount of
time, he has made a lasting impact on his adopted hometown, serving the community, changing the culture of Greater
Cleveland business and working to alter the trajectory of the regions?s economy.

He arrived in Cleveland in 2005, after purchasing a small, underperforming Mercedes?Benz dealership on the West Side.
In just one year, Bernie, then in his mid-305, transformed the dealership, earning it Mercedes? coveted ?Best of the Best?
Award, an honor it would go on to win an unprecedented 12 years in a row. It quickly became the largest?volume
Mercedes?Benz dealership in the Central United States.

Along the way, Bernie began acquiring and transforming more than a dozen additional dealerships, across Northeast
Ohio and into four states, adding such brands as Porsche, Aston Martin, Rolls-Royce and Masarati, eventually becoming
the largest-volume luxury dealer in the Midwest.

Keenly aware of the acceleration of technology, Bernie is always on the lookout for potential disruptive challenges to his
businesses and for promising investment opportunities through start-ups and strategic acquisitions. Bernie Moreno
Companies now boasts a variety of diverse ventures, including tech start-ups, a commercial printing company, a vehicle
subscription service and more. 

No matter the sector, Bernie uses the same effective formula for success: Spot an opportunity, seize it and succeed with
unmatched entrepreneurial energy.

He began a strategic exit from his traditional vehicle dealerships in 2017 to focus on his other ventures, especially
Ownum, a tech start?up that is on a mission to identify, support and commercialize the most promising applications of
blockchain technology.

In 2018, aware that his adopted? hometown, like his businesses, needed to evolve and rethink its strategies to succeed,
Bernie began collaborating with scores of business and community leaders to mobilize a remarkable, community-wide
effort to transform Cleveland into an epicenter of blockchain technology. The result is the Blockland initiative, which,
when realized, will spur the biggest expansion of Northerast Ohio?s economy in a century.

Away from his businesses, he has eagerly embraced his responsibility as a community leader and philanthropist. Bernie
serves in leadership capacities with many local educational and charitable organizations, including the Cleveland Clinic,
Honorary Campaign Chair, The MetroHealth Transformation Campaign, the Cleveland Foundation, the Cuyahoga
Community College Foundation, the Greater Cleveland Partnership and Destination Cleveland. He has served as Chair of
the Board of Cleveland State University, as Co-Chair of the Opportunity Corridor Inclusion Advisory Committee and as a
member of the Governor?s Ohio Task Force on'Community-Police Relations.

Bernie was recently appointed by Ohio Lt. Gov. John Husted to serve on the board oflnnovateOhio, the state?s new
initiative dedicated to making Ohio the most innovative and creative state in the Midwest.

Bernie was born in Bogota, Colombia, and moved to the United States at age 5, becoming a U.S. citizen at age 18. After
graduating from the University of Michigan with a bachelor's degree in Business Administration, he began his career in
the automotive industry with the Saturn Corporation. He then quickly rose through the ranks to become vice president
for New England's largest automotive dealer, before moving to Northeast Ohio.
