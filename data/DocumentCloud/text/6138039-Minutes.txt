NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED AS FOLLOWS:
The foregoing recitals are incorporated herein as findings of the Board of
Commissioners of Cook County, Illinois.
a.
The Property Defined. The Lake Parcel and the Crawford Parcel are
hereinafter referred to collectively as the “Property”. The property on which the
Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County and other County-owned facilities are located,
immediately west of the Lake Parcel, is referred to herein as the “Oak Forest
Hospital Campus”.
b.
Conveyance Authorized.
The Board hereby determines that the
conveyance of the Lake Parcel and the Crawford Parcel to the District is in the
public interest. The Board hereby authorizes the conveyance of the Property to
the District by quit claim deed, in consideration of a total purchase price of
$15,050,000.00 (the “Purchase Price”), for the public purposes of preserving the
existing burial areas in an appropriate manner and as required by applicable laws,
protecting and preserving historic sites, and protecting and preserving the flora,
fauna and scenic beauties, in accordance with the District’s authority. It is hereby
acknowledged that the County has already received $13,261,066.00 from the
District pursuant to District Resolution No. 07-R-02-07-05, which funds shall be
applied to the Purchase Price. Such conveyance shall be subject to restrictions,
covenants and easements shown of record, easements for an existing pipeline,
water line, sanitary and storm sewer lines, and an easement for continued access
by an existing roadway, and shall be “as is”, without warranties of any sort.

c.
Execution of Documents. The Board hereby authorizes the President of
the Board to execute, and the Cook County Clerk to attest to, a quit claim deed or
deeds to effectuate the conveyance described in this Resolution. The Board
further authorizes the President or his designee to execute any and all documents
and take all actions necessary to effectuate the conveyances described herein and
receive the balance of the Purchase Price, in a timely manner and in accordance
with customary terms and conditions, subject to this Resolution; to execute, deliver
and record proper conveyances or agreements regarding the easements; and to
provide for the payment of closing costs customarily borne by sellers out of the
proceeds at closing.
d.
Joint Planning Effort. The Board hereby recognizes that the history of
the Property’s use by the County and the history embodied on the site require
careful consideration and planning of future uses, and should be appropriately
preserved and commemorated in a manner conducive to education of the public,
and that such planning and preservation is the responsibility of both Cook County
and of the District. The Board further recognizes that access to and uses of the
Property require ongoing planning and cooperation and will impact the County,
Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County, and the District. Therefore, the Board hereby
authorizes the President and his designees to engage in a joint planning effort
incorporating historic preservation, investigations, environmental restoration, and
planning for the District’s proposed use of the Property and the impacts of such
use on the Oak Forest Hospital Campus. Further, the Board hereby directs the
