4. Administrative Matters
a. Renewal of Dedicated Internet Access Provider
Mary Pat Burns, fiduciary counsel, stated that she had reviewed a proposal from Cogent, the
current vendor, to provide internet access for three years at a lower rate than under the
pending agreement with the vendor. If the Fund did not accept the proposal, the current
agreement would continue for an additional year. The trustees discussed that the Fund
should not enter any agreement that provided an automatic renewal without the Board’s prior
approval. They also requested a list of all pending contracts with their expiration dates, so
that the Board would have prior notice of the termination dates for all contracts and can
consider whether the engagements should be continued. The Board discussed that the Fund
should allow the current Cogent agreement to continue for an additional year and that it
should determine if internet access could be provided from another vendor.
b. License Renewals
The Board then considered the renewal of licenses and service agreements related to the
firewall and other security for the Fund’s IT systems. The trustees discussed the processes
for securing alternate bidding for services that exceeded $10,000 and whether contract
renewals for less than that amount should require Board approval. They also discussed
whether it would be cost efficient for the Fund to purchase office supplies through contracts
the County has with its vendors.
It was moved by Trustee McFadden and seconded by Trustee Goode that the Board approve
the renewal of a license for Cisco SMARTnet extended service agreement as offered through
CDW-G upon the terms presented for one year at a fee not to exceed $10,801.69, and it was
further moved that the Fund be authorized to enter any related written agreement necessary to
effectuate the foregoing, subject to review by Fund counsel, including the authorization for
the execution and delivery of such written agreement on behalf of the Fund by the President
of the Board.

Saron Tegegne, Comptroller, stated that presentations for actuarial services would be made
by representatives from Cavanaugh MacDonald Consulting (“CavMac”); Gabriel Roeder
Smith & Company (“GRS”); and Segal Consulting (“Segal”). She added that two responders

competitive than the other responders.
Mr. Larry Langer, Ms. Patrice Beckham and Mr. Brad Wild of CavMac, stated that their firm
only provides actuarial services to public pension funds and described the modeling tools
which would accompany the valuations. Mr. Langer was providing actuarial services to the
Fund with another firm at the time the Intergovernmental Agreement dated December 8,
2015, was implemented and which has allowed the County to make additional contributions
to the County Fund. Mr. Lance Weiss, Mr. Alex Rivera and Ms. Kristen Brundirks of GRS
stated that the firm has long provided actuarial valuations to Illinois public pension funds and
understands the concerns of funding in this State. Because of their local experience, they will
be able to provide the Board with the information needed to make funding decisions. Mr.
Dan Levin, Mr. Matt Strom and Mr. Jake Libauskas of Segal, stated that they can provide
deep support for actuarial services and have a strong local presence. The firm has strength in
both pension and OPEB valuations.
The Board posed questions after each presentation inquiring about the firms’ experience with
the needs of public pension funds in Illinois, the qualifications of the team members who
would be assigned to the Fund’s account and the diversity of their staffs, among other things.
At the conclusion of the presentations, the trustees discussed the relative merits of each of the
firms. They considered key personnel, litigation issues and the process for transitioning to a
new vendor in a timely manner.
It was moved by Trustee Goode and seconded by Trustee McFadden that the Board accept
the proposal submitted by Cavanaugh Macdonald Consulting, LLC in response to the Fund’s
Request for a Proposal for Actuarial Services upon the terms presented, including the best
8

 and final offer, and subject to successful contract negotiations. It is further moved that Fund
staff be authorized to take all action reasonably necessary to effectuate the foregoing,
including the negotiation of any related written agreement, subject to review by Fund
counsel, and that the President of the Board or the Executive Director be authorized to
execute and deliver such agreement on behalf of the Fund by the Executive Director.

Gary LeDonne, Director Benefits Administration, stated that the Fund had received the best
and final offers from the two finalists in the Pension Administration System (“PAS”) RFP.
He stated that the Fund needed direction about whether the finalists should be notified about
the status of the RFP. If the implementation of the PAS project were delayed because of the
management transition at the Fund, the teams presented by the finalists might not be
available when the Fund was ready to proceed with the project. The Board directed that the
Fund notify the finalists that the process would be delayed because of the transition matters.
Fund fiduciary counsel was asked to prepare a contract for the PAS vendor and to engage
specialized counsel if necessary.

Trustee Diahann Goode, Chairman of the Legislative Committee, reported that the committee
had convened a meeting immediately preceding the Board’s meeting. John McCabe and

Legislative Committee had recommended that the Board extend the current agreement with
John McCabe and Associates for two years upon the current terms.
It was moved by Trustee McFadden and seconded by Trustee Kouruklis that the Board adopt
the recommendation from the Legislative Committee that the Fund be authorized to engage
John McCabe and Associates as a legislative liaison for two years at an annual rate of
$28,000.00. It was further moved that Fund staff be authorized to take all action reasonably
necessary to effectuate the foregoing, including the negotiation of any related written
agreement, subject to review by Fund counsel, and that the President of the Board or the
Executive Director be authorized to execute and deliver such agreement on behalf of the

Board for the retention of a new Executive Director had been signed by Ms. Regina Tuczak
