LETTER
Transmitting a Communication, dated December 14, 2007 from
RICHARD A. DEVINE, Cook County State’s Attorney
Matthew Birk,
Legal and Labor Affairs Division
Sheriff’s Office of Cook County
Richard J. Daley Center
50 West Washington - Room 704
Chicago, Illinois 60602
Re: 07-503: Appointment of Denise Roche-Evans to the Cook County Emergency
Telephone System Board
Dear Mr. Birk:
You have asked our office to advise you concerning whether any conflict of interest
would be created by the appointment of Denise Roche-Evans, who is employed by the
Sheriff of Cook County as the Director of 911 Communications, to serve as member of
the Cook County Emergency Telephone System Board (“ETSB”). President Stroger
presented this appointment at the November 6, 2007 County Board meeting. The
appointment was referred to the Legislation, Intergovernmental and Veteran’s Relations
Committee, and was discussed at the November 20, 2007 meeting of that committee.
ISSUE PRESENTED:
Whether any conflict of interest would be created by the appointment of Denise RocheEvans, who is employed by the Sheriff of Cook County as Director of 911
Communications, to serve as a member of the Cook County Emergency Telephone
System Board.
CONCLUSION:
This Office has concluded that no conflict would be created by the service of Ms. RocheEvans on the Cook County ETSB. Pursuant to ordinance, “at least three members of the
[ETSB] shall be representatives of the 9-1-1 public safety agencies, … and appointed on
the basis of their experience.” Cook County Ord. § 26-79(b). Further, it is our
understanding the Ms. Roche-Evans’ position as the Sheriff’s Police Department’s
Director of 911 Communications, is funded entirely by the County through the budget of
the Sheriff and not by the Emergency Telephone System Fund. Moreover, in her capacity
as the Sheriff’s 911 Communications Director, Ms. Roche-Evans is supervised
exclusively by the Sheriff and his delegates, and not the ETSB or the ETSB’s executive
Director.
DISCUSSION:
The Cook County ESTB was established pursuant to statute by county-wide referendum
held on April 20, 1993. See, 50 ILCS 750/1 et seq.; Cook County Ord. No. 92-O-49,
adopted September 21, 1992), presently codified at Cook County Ord. §§ 26-71 through
26-80. Section 26-79(b) provides as follows:

ITEM #5 cont’d
(b) At least three members of the Board shall be representatives of the 9-1-1 public
safety agencies, including but not limited to police departments, fire departments,
emergency medical services providers, and emergency services and disaster agencies, and
appointed on the basis of their ability or experience. Elected officials are also eligible to
serve on the Board. Members of the board shall serve without compensation but shall be
reimbursed for their actual and necessary expenses.
Cook County Ord. § 26-79. As is evident, three of the ETSB board members are required
to possess qualifications of the type possessed by Ms. Roche-Evans, i.e., experience in
911 communications.
A review of caselaw and opinions issued by the Illinois Attorney General concerning
conflict of interest and incompatibility of public offices reveals that a conflict exists
when two offices are viewed as fiscally incompatible. See, e.g., People ex rel. Theros v.
Verbeck, 155 Ill. App. 3d 81, 83-84 (1st Dist. 1987) (Defendant’s two offices were
fiscally incompatible since defendant as a member of the county board had authority to
act upon the salary and budget of the county coroner who, in turn, determines
defendant’s salary as deputy county coroner. The potential for influencing his superior’s
salary and budget and, ultimately, his own salary, without more, rendered defendant’s
offices incompatible.)
Further, a conflict has been found to exist when a subordinate official, in another
capacity, supervises his superior. See, Rogers v. Village of Tinley Park, 116 Ill. App. 3d
437, 441 (1st Dist. 1983) (Positions of municipal police officer and village trustee
incompatible); 1996 Ill. Op. Att’y Gen. No. 96-042 (Conflict of interest in county board
member serving as county housing authority executive director, because county board
member’s power to act upon appointment of housing authority commissioner, who in
turn selected and supervised executive director of the housing authority precluded
simultaneous tenure in these positions.)
The appointment of Ms. Roche-Evans to the County ETSB implicates neither of these
potential areas of conflict. No fiscal incompatibility can be present because Ms. RocheEvans’ salary as the Sheriff’s Director of 911 Communications is not paid from any
ETSB funds, but rather exclusively through the Sheriff’s budget as provided in the
annual Cook County appropriations ordinance. Further, in her capacity as 911
Communications Director for the Sheriff, it is our understanding that Ms. Roche-Evans is
supervised exclusively by the Sheriff and his delegates and is not responsible to the
ETSB.
Thus, this Office has concluded that no conflict of interest is presented by the proposed
appointment of Ms. Roche-Evans to the Cook County ETSB.
