Shop Sauganash Mission
Our vision is to create a gateway to the Sauganash business community by attracting commercial
development, encouraging retail spending, creating new restaurants and transforming and enhancing
existing retail and service space within the underutilized Cicero Avenue business corridor between
Devon and Peterson. Provide a safe, attractive, friendly and hassle-free experience for pedestrians,
cyclists, commuters, shoppers and local workers.
Public comment is encouraged throughout the meeting. The Chair will recognize non-commission
members as appropriate. Non-commission members wishing to address the commission should so
signify by raising their hand in order to be recognized by the Chair. The Chair will have discretion to
limit discussion.
