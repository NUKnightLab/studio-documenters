In addition to the software products. vendor will provide training for end users and "consulting services."
which will cover implementation support. system customizations, data transfer configurations. and project
management.

OUTCOMES:

The acquisition of this system will establish a 'one stop shep? tool for completion. college and career
planning, and reporting on the KPI data associated with these activities. such as the percent of Seniors
submitting one application to a "match? postsecondary institution. Students will have the resources
required to conduct highly organized and effective postseoondary planning and educators and
administrators have the tools to track individual student and school progress in postsecondary
preparation. The data collection. analysis, and reporting function provided by the system will not only
allow practitioners to go about their required reporting tasks more efficiently, it can drive improved
postsecondary outcomes for students by facilitating a more sophisticated analysis of the correlations
between student profiles, postsecondary planning actions, and outcomes.

Additionally. considering the fact that nearly sixty (60) high schools in the district currently purchase
Naviance products individually at prices much higher than we are able to secure through this contract. the
Board will be swapping out an inef?cient spend for one that returns more value and utilizes the scale of
the district to obtain a better per student price for the products and services that support college and
career planning and its correspondent data reporting.
