Projects
Joe Louis Arena Brownfield Plan
Ms. Kanalos, Mr. Walters, and Ms. Rice presented the Brownfield Plan for the Joe Louis
Arena Redevelopment Project.
Project Introduction
In connection with the development of the property commonly known as the “Little
Caesars Arena”, an agreement was reached by the applicable parties to demolish the
JLA once the Little Caesars Arena was completed and ready for use. As of the date of
this Plan, the Little Caesars Arena has been completed and the Detroit Red Wings have
vacated the JLA and relocated to the Little Caesars Arena.
The primary purpose of this Plan is to facilitate the demolition of the JLA and to prepare
the Property for a future mixed-use development, which may include residential,
commercial, and/or retail space. For the purposes of this Plan, the use of the term
“Developer” shall refer to the City of Detroit. The City of Detroit is the owner of Joe Louis
Arena and the Detroit Building Authority will oversee demolition.
Total TIF reimbursement amount for the demolition and related eligible activities under
this Plan is $5,561,009.
Property Subject to the Plan
The eligible property (the “Property”) consists of six (6) parcels located at 27 Washington
Boulevard. The common address of the JLA is also known as “600 Civic Center Drive.”
25 Washington Boulevard, 29 Washington Boulevard, 31 Washington Boulevard, and 33
Washington Boulevard are properties that are adjacent and continuous to 27 Washington

 Boulevard. 501 Third is also adjacent to 27 Washington Boulevard and is the location of
the Detroit People Mover – Joe Louis Arena Station Stop. The Property is located
adjacent to the Central Business District and is generally bounded by Jefferson Street to
the north, Atwater Street to the east, Detroit River to the south and Cobo Convention
Center to the west.
Basis of Eligibility
The Property is considered “eligible property” as defined by Act 381, Section 2 because
(a) the Property was previously utilized for a public purpose; (b) it is located within the
City of Detroit, a qualified local governmental unit under Act 381; and (c) the Property is
determined to be a functionally obsolete or adjacent and contiguous as defined by Act
381.
Eligible Activities and Projected Costs
The “eligible activities” that are intended to be carried out at the Property are considered
“eligible activities” as defined by Sec 2 of Act 381, because they include environmental
assessment activities, demolition and abatement and brownfield plan and work plan
preparation and brownfield plan implementation. The eligible activities and budgeted
costs are intended as part of the development of the Property and will be financed solely
by the Developer. The Authority is not responsible for any costs of eligible activities and
will incur no debt. The eligible activities are estimated to begin within eighteen months
and be completed within three (3) years.
Tax Increment Financing (TIF) Capture
The Developer desires to be reimbursed for the costs of eligible activities. Tax increment
revenue generated by the Property will be captured by the DBRA and used to reimburse
the cost of the eligible activities completed on the Property after approval of this Plan
pursuant to the terms of a Reimbursement Agreement with the DBRA.

reimbursement from tax increment revenues of the DBRA from the Property shall be
governed by the terms of the Reimbursement Agreement.
Other Incentives
The Developer is seeking a loan through the Michigan Strategic Fund’s Community
Revitalization Program.
Ms. Stahl asked if the use of the term “deconstruction” was intentional, or if it was being
used synonymously with the term “demolition”. Ms. Rice explained that the use of the
term “deconstruction” was intentional, since Joe Louis Arena will be deconstructed in
phases over a longer period of time per the recommendation of the engineer contractor,
versus an implosion or demolition of the structure.
Ms. Stahl asked if the materials from Joe Louis Arena will be reused. Mr. Palazzolo
explained that the contractor performed the deconstruction will be responsible for the
disposal, recycling and/or reuse of the building materials. Mr. Walters explained that the
memorabilia inside Joe Louis Arena will be sold and donated and the revenue of such
sales will go to the City of Detroit.
Mr. Cheeks asked about the loan process for the Community Revitalization Program
(CRP). Ms. Pavelko explained that the CRP loan will fund the deconstruction of the arena,
that the CRP loan will have an interest rate that has yet to be determined, the City of
Detroit will make payments on the loan from the City’s General Fund until TIF revenue is
generated. The expected TIF revenue will act as collateral for the CRP loan. Ms. Kanalos
advised that the TIF capture is being delayed for five years under the Brownfield Plan in
anticipation that it may take a few years for new development to happen on the site.
Ms. Stahl asked if the CRP usually provides funding in the form of a loan or grant. Ms.
Pavelko advised that the CRP issues grants in amounts below $1.5 million.
Ms. Stahl asked what will happen if a new development happens on the site in less than
five years. Ms. Kanalos stated that there is flexibility in the plan to begin the TIF capture
earlier than 2024, if necessary.
Ms. Stahl asked when the City of Detroit will begin repayment of the CRP loan. Ms.
Pavelko stated that the City of Detroit will likely begin payments on the CRP loan at the
conclusion of deconstruction of Joe Louis Arena and will likely make payments from the
City’s General Fund.
Ms. Sagovac asked what the estimated revenue will be from the sale of memorabilia from
Joe Louis Arena and what the efforts will be to market the memorabilia for sale. Mr.
Walters explained that the suite holders and season ticket holders have already been
given an opportunity to purchase seats in advance of the public sale of memorabilia.
Some memorabilia will be offered to non-profit organizations at cost. A website has been

 created to market the memorabilia, and Olympia Entertainment will also market the
memorabilia. The expected revenue is between $1.5 and $2 million.
Mr. Rawls asked if there is expected to be any environmental cleanup on the site before
a new development can be constructed. Mr. Walters stated that given the location of the
site on the riverfront and its long history of development, some environmental clean-up is
expected.
Ms. Sagovac asked if there will be any green space created on the site along the riverfront
when a new development occurs. Mr. Walters explained that the City of Detroit has been
working with the Detroit Riverfront Conservancy and adjacent parcel owners such as Mr.
Peter Cummings and the Riverfront Towers, to continue the walkway on the riverfront.
The existing Riverwalk in front of the arena will remain and the City will strongly encourage
additional green space be a feature of the new development on the site near the riverwalk.
Mr. Rawls asked if the combination of public and private uses for the space envisioned in
the City of Detroit’s master plan will be realized in the future new development on the site.
Mr. Walters explained that FGIC has an Option Agreement with the City of Detroit for the
future development of the site. The parcels may be rezoned as B5 and the addition of
public space will be encouraged. The new development should compliment the adjacent
COBO Hall.
Mr. Cheeks asked if the rezoning of the parcels to B5 will allow for mixed use. Mr. Walters
advised that a B5 zoning is for high-density commercial uses and will allow for a mixeduse development.
Ms. Stahl asked if a brownfield plan is a requirement for the CRP loan. Ms. Pavelko
explained that the brownfield plan is required for the CRP loan and that the Brownfield
Plan and the terms for the CRP loan will go to the Michigan Strategic Fund for approval
at the same time.
Ms. Stahl asked if the terms for the CRP loan will go to Detroit City Council for approval.
Mr. Walters explained that all contracts with the City of Detroit go to Detroit City Council
for approval.
Ms. Stahl asked if the City of Detroit can do anything more than strongly encourage
certain developments and/or certain features to be included in a new development on the
site. Mr. Rawls explained that the rezoning of the parcels is an opportunity to influence
the new development on the site. Mr. Walters explained that the Detroit Water and
Sewage Department’s storm water drainage fees should encourage environmental
features to mitigate storm water to receive credits on the storm water drainage fees.
Ms. Stahl asked if the new development will be required to have 20% of new housing
units affordable. Mr. Walters explained that the approvals being sought so far are by the
City of Detroit for demolition only with the City as the beneficiary of the Brownfield Plan.
The extent of housing on the site by a future developer is not known at this time.

 Ms. Stahl asked what the interest rate will be on the CRP loan. Ms. Pavelko explained
that the typical interest rate on a CRP loan is around 1%. The interest rate for this
particular CRP loan has not yet been defined, but is expected to be between 1% and 3%
and the loan documents will lay out all of the details and terms for the CRP loan.
Mr. Rawls asked about the Administrative Costs under the Brownfield Plan. Ms. Kanalos
explained that the DBRA Administrative Costs are used to operate the DBRA program
and all Brownfield Plans pay the DBRA Administrative Costs.
Mr. Rawls called for a motion recommending Joe Louis Arena Brownfield Plan.
Mr. Blocker motioned to recommend approval of the Joe Louis Arena Brownfield
Redevelopment without a CAC public hearing and without appointing special
members. Mr. Cheeks seconded the motion. DBRA-CAC Resolution Code 1806-256-02, recommending approval of the Joe Louis Arena Brownfield
Redevelopment Plan, was approved. Ms. Stahl abstained.
Administrative
Schedule of DBRA-CAC Meetings for FY 2018-2019
Ms. Kanalos presented the suggested FY 2018-2019 meeting schedule, keeping with the
tradition of scheduling a meeting the second and fourth Wednesdays of each month,
except for adjustments needed for holidays, at 5:00 pm at the DEGC offices at 500
Griswold, Suite 2200, Detroit, MI.
Mr. Rawls called for a motion recommending adoption of the FY 2018-2019 DBRA-CAC
meeting schedule. The Committee took the following action:
On a motion by Mr. Lutz, seconded by Mr. Blocker, DBRA-CAC Resolution Code
18-06-01-44, approving the FY 2018-2019 DBRA-CAC meeting schedule, was
unanimously approved.
Other
Mr. Cheeks inquired about the appointment and reappointment of Community Advisory
Committee members. Ms. Kanalos explained that the Detroit City Council has decided to
wait until all interviews are completed before voting on the slate of appointees and
reappointees. .
Mr. Blocker shared information regarding the Ashton redevelopment project, stating that
due to a change in the financing of the project, the proposed condominiums will now be
apartments and there will be fewer residential units due to the addition of a small hotel.
Ms. Stahl asked if the change in condominiums to apartments and the addition of the
hotel are in line with the City of Detroit’s housing goals. Mr. Vosburg stated that DBRA
staff are currently reviewing the proposed changes to this project to see if it will require
an amendment to the Brownfield Plan. Compliance with any other City policies will also
be examined.

 Ms. Stahl stated that she would have liked to have seen a cost/benefit analysis for the
city for the Joe Louis Arena project.
