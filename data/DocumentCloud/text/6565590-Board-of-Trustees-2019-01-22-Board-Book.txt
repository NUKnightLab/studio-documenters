CUYAHOGA COUNTY PUBLIC LIBRARY
BOARD OF TRUSTEES MEETING
MINUTES
18 December 2018
The December 18, 2018 meeting of the Cuyahoga County Public Library Board of Trustees was held at
the Cuyahoga County Public Library Administration Building Auditorium, 2111 Snow Road, Parma, Ohio.



Resolution to Amend Official Certificate of Estimated Resources and Amend
Appropriations
Director Morgan mentioned this resolution is first on the agenda as Trustee DePiero cannot stay for the
entire Board of Trustees meeting and we need a super majority for this resolution to pass.
Director Morgan stated estimated resources in the general fund will exceed the estimate by approximately
$1.45 million. The additional dollars come from an increase over budget for both the Public Library Fund
(PLF) and real estate taxes. The increase in the Capital Fund is for a transfer, pledge payments and the
second distribution from the McGowan estate. The increase in the Trust Funds is for transfer of funds to
the Capital Fund. The small increase in the Endowment Funds is for additional interest on investments
and the Agency Fund increase is for additional dollars that employees put into their flexible spending
accounts.
Director Morgan stated on the appropriations side in the general fund we need to appropriate the
additional $1.45 million. In the Note Retirement Fund, we are $0.32 short and in the Trust Funds we
need to appropriate additional funds to transfer those funds to the Capital Fund. We are requesting
amendment to both the estimated resources and appropriations.
01-12/2018
Trustee Varley moved approval, seconded by Trustee DePiero. Seeing no additional discussion, the
Resolution to Amend Official Certificate of Estimated Resources and Amend Appropriations was
approved by unanimous vote of the Board members present. (See page 288)
Roll-Call:

Yea: Edward H. Blakemore; Dean E. DePiero; William J. Leonard;

that were sent to the Board members in advance of this meeting.
02-12/2018
Trustee DePiero moved to approve the minutes, seconded by Trustee Blakemore. Seeing no corrections,

Public Comment:
There was no public comment.
Report of the Board President:
President Shlonsky stated that Trustee Varley has chaired the Nominating Committee and the following
have accepted nominations to board leadership positions for the upcoming fiscal year: Trustee Shlonsky
to fill the role of President, Trustee Leonard to fill the role of Vice President, Trustee Hijar to fill the role of
Secretary. The official vote will be at the January 2019 meeting.
President Shlonsky wished everyone a happy holiday season and a happy and safe new year.
Report of the Executive Director:
Executive Director Feldman mentioned that we received a resolution from the House of Representatives,
particularly from Nickie Antonio, Ryan Smith and Nicolas Celebrezze, congratulating us on being named
once again a “five star” system by Library Journal.
Executive Director Feldman wished everyone a happy holiday season, a safe new year and good health
in 2019.
Director Rich commented as we close out 2018, we wanted to take the opportunity to get a recap on the
work, we did this year on the investment the organization made in the awareness campaign. She
introduced Roger Frank and Ellen Russell of Little Jacket. They will share a quick recap of metrics and a
summary looking ahead to 2019 with the “Find Yourself” theme.
Director Rich stated our overall objective was to elevate awareness broadly and to remind non-customers
the library is out there and making them aware of our programs and services that they may not know we
are offering. In looking at this metric it was an effective and productive campaign that helped to increase
our media messaging platform at an affordable rate. We now have a campaign created beyond this year
that we will carry into 2019. We are happy with the results we accomplished with Little Jacket.
Trustee Spangler commented, we talked about a significant spend with WKYC. How does that help with
this campaign?
Director Rich stated looking at our partnership with WKYC into 2019 we can blend into the messaging
from our “Find Yourself” theme. It will give us a platform through a monthly segment to connect with
people and tell the story about our innovation centers and programs. Looking ahead in 2019 our goal is
specifically driving visits into our branches.

Finance Committee Report:
Finance Committee Chair Leonard reminded us the Finance Committee met prior to the Board meeting,
and Director Morgan gave an in-depth review of the financials.
Director Morgan gave highlights from the Finance report. He stated in general property taxes through
advances we have exceeded our budget. This put us over budget for the year. He stated those dollars will
be carried over into next year towards several expensive capital projects.
Director Morgan stated in the Public Library Fund (PLF) exceeded what we received last year. He stated
if this trend continues, we should see a slight increase from what we have budgeted.
Director Morgan stated fines and fees are back up. He stated the largest increase continues to be in the
area of passports due to the $10.00 increase in passport processing fees. He stated we are processing
more passports than in the years past.
Director Morgan mentioned the percentage increase for interest is large even though the amount of
revenue is small. The budget was based on what was received last year with a slight increase, rates
have performed better than expected.
All other revenue accounts are where we would expect them to be for the month of November.
Director Morgan stated in general expenditures, salaries and benefits are where we expect them to be at
this time of year and we will be able to finish the year well within budget.
Director Morgan stated all other expense accounts are within budget.
Director Morgan stated there are some negative balances in the 3000 accounts in the general fund, and
the Note Retirement fund and the Trust fund. Those amounts will be covered by an increase in estimated
resources and appropriations, as well as closing standing orders for year end. Those accounts will have
positive balances when we prepare the December report.
Director Morgan stated all other expense accounts for both the general fund and all other funds are within
budget for this time of year.
(See under FINANCE)
Investments – November
Director Morgan stated there were no new investment purchases for the month. We do continue to see a
steady increase in rates and as those investments mature, we will be able to see an increase in the yield
on those purchases. There were no transfers for the month.

year and it needs replacement. The bids were opened for this project and our two lowest bidders were
tied for the exact same amount. We resolved the tie by having both bidders come to CCPL, and we
flipped a coin which we videotaped should there be future questions. The winner of the flip was
Northeastern Refrigeration.

Relating to the New Construction of The Middleburg Heights Branch Library Located in The

Director Morgan stated we were in the process of signing the final amount of the Guaranteed Maximum
Pricing (GMP) for Middleburg Heights and RFC Contracting, Inc., came back to us and asked for an
additional $200,000.00 for this project. We only brought $100,000.00 to the Board as we thought through
some reimbursements, we may receive some of the money back. We did not receive rebates back and
we are requesting an additional $100,000.00 to add to the GMP to make the final pay application for the
project. We are still well under budget of the $7.5 million we set aside for the project. We will be
$97,000.00 under budget with the additional $100,000.00 expenditure.
08-12/2018

EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR’S MESSAGE
Resolving to Read
Successful New Year’s resolutions are the ones that become habits.
This January, Cuyahoga County Public Library (CCPL) is encouraging
county residents to make reading more books their resolution. Much
like eating healthier foods or getting more exercise, there are many
beneﬁts to frequent reading. In fact, studies have shown that frequent
readers are more likely be successful academically and professionally
and more involved in their communities. They’re even more likely to
be physically healthy.
We are inviting county residents to start a new reading habit by joining
our book club collaboration with WKYC-TV’s “Live on Lakeside.” Each
month our staff will visit “Live on Lakeside” to discuss a new title, take
questions, chat about our takeaways from the books and (sometimes)
even hear from the authors themselves. In keeping with January’s
New Year’s resolution theme, our ﬁrst book club title is the wildly
popular self-help book You Are a Badass: How to Stop Doubting
Your Greatness and Start Living an Awesome Life by Jen Sincero.
Jen recently entertained hundreds of fans in our Parma-Snow Branch
auditorium with her personal journey to awesomeness and shared
inspiring advice for ﬁnding happiness through self-afﬁrmation. We
look forward to discussing her book with WKYC’s viewers.
Speaking of great author events … our Beyond the Book Jacket
speakers series is loaded with great events into the spring. In the
ﬁrst quarter alone we will welcome acclaimed poet Claudia Rankine,
former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, rising political star Pete
Buttigieg, “The Happiness Project” creator Gretchen Rubin, Dr.
Michael Roizen, award-winning novelist Harlan Coben, best-selling
authors Ian Rankin, Lisa Gardner and more. Whether you are an avid
reader or just trying to build some reading momentum, we have plenty
of great events to energize and inspire you.
Sticking to a New Year’s resolution can be tough, but we’re here for
you. Just know that anytime you need a reading recommendation or
someone to talk books with or a place to connect with fellow readers
(and your favorite authors), we have you covered. Together we will
make 2019 a year of reading.
Regards,

Executive Director

MAKING A DIFFERENCE
BSA II Mary Lou Spear Camloh noticed a 2-year-old boy crying and giving his grandmother a
hard time. She quietly walked over and began talking to the child. As he was eating snacks, Mary
Lou identiﬁed all the orange items on the table – cheese puffs, an orange peel and an orange cap
from a drink bottle. The child then pointed to an orange gummy bear and Mary Lou responded by
saying how smart he was. She then asked him if he knew various body parts. After he correctly
identiﬁed them, Mary Lou played “Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes” with him, which he followed
very well. After their exchange, the young child played quietly. Mary Lou inquired about the
names of his twin brother and younger sister and invited them to “Baby and Toddler Storytime.”

Angeline James from BPK called OLF looking for a cookbook for a patron called Thug Kitchen
101. The patron needed one recipe, collard greens, from the book for a dinner party she was
having in the evening. Jodi Carlson from OLF located the book on the shelf, scanned the recipe to
email and sent it to Angeline. Angeline printed the recipe for the customer, who was very happy
that she did not need to drive to another branch.

An older gentleman entered the branch asking for directions downtown. He wanted to pick up an
FMLA packet. He needed the exact location to acquire the package because he was going to ﬁle
soon and lost his last packet. I searched “FMLA packet” and showed the customer what I found.
To the gentleman’s delight, it was what he needed. The customer was very appreciative, shook my
hand and asked for my name.

Since September, a very shy child and his nanny have been attending my “Baby and Me Storytime.”
They started coming in September. At ﬁrst the child would just sit on his nanny’s lap and wouldn’t
even reach for a board book when I handed them out. Slowly he started to participate. I was
thrilled when he also attended a Kindermusik class. He participated in the exercises and dances
and loved when they handed out jingle bells. He clearly recognizes me and smiles when he sees
me. I talked to the nanny afterwards and she said coming to “Baby and Me Storytime” has helped
him with socialization skills. It is thrilling to see the effects that storytime can have on children.

Avril McInally hosted a book discussion with a twist at the Fairview Park Senior Center. The group
of eight seniors and Avril discussed Betsy Lerner’s The Bridge Ladies. Instead of the usual discussion,
Avril selected Yiddish and Hebrew terms from the book and copied the terms (along with their
deﬁnitions) onto notecards. Each participant had three cards to read and use as a connector to
the memoir. This led to a lively discussion in which every member actively participated in learning
more about Jewish culture and how it related to their own lives as well as the lives of the women
in the book.

I received a letter from Janet Ingraham Dwyer, on behalf of Ohio Ready to Read, thankful for
our support of Sarah Polace’s participation as an Ohio Digital Media Literacy Workshop trainer
in 2018. As a facilitator for this project, Sarah shared her expertise and trained more than 75
youth library professionals from ﬁve library systems. There were various learning outcomes for
participants that will enable them to effectively and conﬁdently give parents critical guidance when
navigating digital media with their young children.

Sarah Slivka observed a customer who appeared in distress. The customer was upset, on her
phone and mentioned “not having anywhere to go.” Sarah sat down with the customer and shared
the resources Bellefaire JCB and 211. The customer shared her situation. She is from another
state, was unable to get home and had phone issues. Sarah found her a spare phone charger that
Ben Cox brought in for customer use and made a landline available to her. The customer called
211 and began working on a strategy to get home. Through Sarah’s observation plus calm and
thoughtful response, a customer found assistance in a desperate time. Sarah was excellent in a
delicate customer transaction.

The Parma Heights Branch staff received a lovely surprise from Aspire Greater Cleveland teacher
Elba Serra and her ESOL class. Elba came out of the meeting room and asked staff members Amy
Bartko and Nadeem Khalid if they could help her. The two followed Elba to the meeting room,
thinking that she may need help moving equipment or something of that nature. Inside the room,
all of the ESOL students were waiting for Amy and Nadeem to thank them for their support. Each
one of the students came forward and handed Amy and Nadeem holiday cards with thank you
notes inside. They also gave them a bag of sugar cookies and cupcakes.

SYSTEM HIGHLIGHTS
On Saturday, December 8th, the Parma-Snow Branch celebrated the ﬁfth anniversary of the
building’s renovation and expansion with a variety of programs and light refreshments. The
Bubble Lady entertained a group of 75, magician Rick Smith Jr. astounded his audience
of 85, a group of six adults tested their knowledge of Cleveland in a “They Came From
Cleveland” trivia program and 36 people stayed for the sensory-friendly afternoon showing
of the movie Happy Feet. An estimated 150 slices of cake were enjoyed, along with pop,
lemonade and pretzels. Many children participated in making crafts and face painting.

Teachers from the North Olmsted City School District provided positive feedback on their
students’ progress since they enrolled in this season’s CCPL “1-2-3 READ” program at the
North Olmsted Branch. Parents said the children loved the program, have improved their
reading scores signiﬁcantly and have increased their conﬁdence. The proof is in the numbers.
Thirty words per minute (WPM) is the benchmark and several 1-2-3 READ students achieved
scores in the 70s and as high as 91 WPM.

The Brook Park Branch presented its annual winter talks to 143 third and fourth graders at
Brookview Elementary School. Each staff member shared three books, which generated a
buzz of excitement with the kids. After their presentations, they gave every student a candy
cane and a scratch-and-sniff bookmark. The teachers received copies of the bibliography.
The school librarians then hosted a luncheon for the Brook Park Branch staff.

Parma Heights Adult BSL II Rosa Minniti presented 30 minutes of holiday-themed stories,
poems, songs and other multisensory activities for 22 adults at Medicore Transport and
Achievement Center, which is a day program for adults with developmental disabilities. Rosa
incorporated bells, drums and a large stretchy movement band with the stories and poems.

Fairview Park Branch Manager Jesse Sanders helped a customer with a phone reference
question. The customer wanted a listing of companies that had gone bankrupt in the last 10
years and was looking for a speciﬁc company. When the customer came to the branch to
pick up the packet Jesse had prepared for him, he also gave an impromptu card magic show.
As it turns out, the customer has been a practicing illusionist for several decades and wanted
to show how appreciative he was.

The ﬁrst series of “Ready Set Create! Building Challenges for Kids” wrapped up at the Parma
Branch December 1st. The four hands-on workshops were attended by 67 kids, who, with
the civil engineer presenters, explored building and design principles, water cleanup and
electricity.

Thirty-ﬁve customers visited the North Olmsted Branch on December 1st for the Great Books
for Kids Holiday Pop-Up Shop. The event included a readers’ advisory team, toys from the Toy
Collection and bookmark card-making stations. More than $450 worth of books and other
merchandise were sold. Special thanks go to Branch Manager Andrew Harant (NOL/OLF), Lisa
Woodruff and Kathy Rak (NOL), Mary Schreiber (CDD), Rob Rua and Courtney Conway (CER),
Peg Tomek (BAY) and Sarah Carpenter (BCH) for making this pop-up shop successful.

Amanda Piccirillo, BSA I at the Southeast Branch, represented CCPL at the annual Christmas
in Bedford Falls event. More than 203 residents of varying ages dropped by the Treehouse
in downtown Bedford and enjoyed a variety of stories read by Amanda throughout the
afternoon. Attendees were also treated to candy canes. Darlene Davis, BSL II at the Southeast
Branch, welcomed 72 children to join her in coloring trains, which were then placed on the
railroad tracks circling the walls of the room. They also enjoy putting together tracks and
scenery with train sets on loan from teen librarian Sarah Gnoddie.

A customer was doing some work in the Maple Heights Branch when she stopped to tell
PSL II Regina Stopper how grateful she was for the help she received from the Cuyahoga
Works: Job and Career Services staff more than six years ago. The customer said the talent
assessment a counselor administered to her pointed her toward a career path that she would
never have considered otherwise. She ended up doing so well in this ﬁeld that she began her
own company, which is ﬂourishing to this day. Then she proudly showed Regina photos of
her new Harley Low Rider, which she could not have previously afforded.

On December 27th, the Friends of the Warrensville Heights Library and Phi Delta Kappa
Sorority hosted “Kwanzaa,” celebrating the day of Kujichagulia, which means “selfdetermination.” More than 90 customers from all over joined the celebration. The program
consisted of singing, storytelling, dancing and a wonderful feast. Branch Manager Ali Boyd,
the speaker for the evening, discussed the meaning of Kwanzaa with the guests.

A group of seventh and eighth grade students from South Suburban Montessori School visited
the Brecksville Branch to work on research for their Ohio History Day projects. Teen librarian
Maryanne Haller gave the group a tour of the branch and shared a PowerPoint presentation
on CCPL’s database resources and how to ﬁnd and evaluate relevant and credible sources. The
students’ research topics varied from Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster (the creators of Superman), to
Balto and the 1925 serum run to Nome, to Elliot Ness and the torso murders.

Independence Branch staff visited the Independence Primary School to present three adapted
storytimes to three preschool classes. The staff read two stories about sweet treats to the
students using double visuals. The parent of one of the students told the staff that his daughter
always asks to go to the library after adapted storytimes to check out the books the librarian
read that day.

Twenty customers enjoyed the Mayﬁeld Branch’s bird feeder maker program. Participants selected
a bird feeder to decorate with small laser cut wooden shapes, painted their feeders and used
laminated recycled book covers to make rooves. Families learned how to use the laser engraver
to create tiny cutouts and engrave custom names and phrases into their bird feeders.

Financial Statement Analysis
December 2018

Revenues
As was discussed some time ago, we knew that our revenues from our General
Property Taxes had exceeded our original budget. The final amount received was
$42,752,869.90. This amount exceeded our original budget by $707,869.90.
We also assumed our revenues from the PLF would exceed our original budget. The
final amount received was $20,769,026.45 and this exceeded our original budget by
$781,590.41. As was also previously mentioned this amount and the amount we were
over in General Property Taxes will be carried forward to 2019 to fund several large
projects in Facilities.
Patron Fines and Fees also exceeded our original budget. The amount received was
$1,356,592.28. This amount exceeded our original budget by $6,592.28. Our Fines
and Fees revenue was down from last year, but the increase in Passport Fees helped to
cover the decrease.
With the increase in interest rates we also exceeded our original budget by $35,429.65
for interest (General Fund). Our Sale of Resale Supplies original budget was also
exceeded by $17,791.94.
All other revenue accounts are where we would expect them to be for the month and
the year.

Expenses
With governmental accounting we cannot close our books for the year with any
balances that may be negative (actual expenses exceed appropriation) so we made
adjustments to some of the appropriations to show all accounts with a positive balance.
Salaries and Benefits, Supplies, Library Materials and Capital all came in under original
budget. Purchased and Contracted Services and Other Objects both needed a small
increase to the original budget to close out the year.
Once we closed the Standing Orders (blanket purchase orders) this put funds back into
several accounts where we were short of budget. The closing of those purchase orders
along with the increases in General Property Taxes and PLF gave us a carryover of
$1,851,996.98 for the General Fund. As mentioned above those funds will be used for
capital projects planned in 2019.

 33

Investments
We reinvested the proceeds from a CD that matured at TriState Bank with another
CDARS for 6 months with a purchase yield of 1.59%. We kept the maturity at 6 months
as there is a possibility that we could see a rate increase at maturity. There were no
other investments for the month.

Transfers
We needed to make 3 advances to Special Revenue Funds:

Project Build

$1,149.24

Hotspot Lending

$19,434.00

Special School Programming

$4,500.82

Those advances will be paid back in 2019.

We also needed to make several transfers for the month to closeout the year:

Adult Education Services-ASPIRE

$142,800.00

Pollinator Garden

$2,500.00

Unclaimed Funds

$784.21

Credit Card Responsibility and Use Procedures
A credit card account has been established to meet the needs of your department for incidental
purchases. Upon receipt of proper documentation and itemized receipt, credit card expenditures will
be paid through the Fiscal Officer’s office.
***A credit card does not replace requisitions and purchase orders.
Conditions of Use. Expenses may be incurred with the credit card only if all of the following
conditions are met:
1. Expenditures must be within the guidelines of the particular activity of your department and
budget. The expenditure may only be made after the approval of any required requisition and
purchase order. The credit card is not to be used for any personal expenses.
2. Expenditures to be paid must be less than your credit limit of $___________. There are no
exceptions.
3. Proper documentation to support the expenditure must be sent to the Compliance Officer prior to
receipt of the monthly statement.
a. Proper documentation is to include:
i. Itemized paid receipt indicating the amount paid, the vendor, and an itemized description of the
purchase.
ii. In the case of books, subscriptions or similar types of orders, a copy of the order form or
document, and the packing slip or other receiving document.
iii. A hardcopy print-out for any items ordered online.
b. Examples of documentation not allowed:
i. Non-itemized cash register receipts.
ii. Handwritten requests for reimbursement without receipts or other verification.
4. The Library is exempt from sales tax, and all reasonable efforts should be made to ensure that
sales tax is not charged by vendors in connection with purchases made via credit card. A tax
exemption certificate is available in the Fiscal Officer’s office. In some cases, if you merely mention
to the vendor that the purchase is tax exempt, no sales tax will be charged.

the credit card is lost or stolen, you must immediately report same to the Fiscal Officer and
Compliance Officer.

property of the financial institution from which it was issued. The right to use the credit card may be
revoked at any time without notice by the issuing financial institution or by the Library’s Fiscal
Officer or Director. You must immediately return the credit card to the Library upon termination of
your employment with the Library or in the event of a change in your position/title.
