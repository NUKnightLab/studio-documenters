particular, may be made by a Supplemental Indenture with the written consent given as
provided in Section 1103 hereof of the Owners of at least a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the Notes then Outstanding at the time such consent is given;
provided, however, that if such modi?cation or amendment will, by its terms, not take

?led with the Trustee the Written consents of the Owners of the required principal
amount of Outstanding Notes, and (ii) a Counsel?s Opinion stating that the execution and

Notes by ?ling with the Trustee, prior to the time when the Trustee?s written statement
hereafter 'in this Section referred to is ?led, a written revocation, with proof that such

prior to any mailing or publication required by this Article and shall not be deemed
ineffective by reason of such prior delivery or ?ling.

theretofore revoked shall be suf?cient under this Section, the Trustee shall make and
deliver to the Board a written statement that the consents of the Owners of the required
principal amount of Outstanding Notes have been ?led with the Trustee. Such written
statement shall be conclusive that such consents have been so ?led. Any time thereafter
notice, stating in substance that the Supplemental Indenture has been consented to by the
Owners of the required principal amount of Outstanding Notes and will be effective as
provided in this Section, shall be given by mailing to the Owners (but failure to mail such
notice or any defect therein shall not prevent such Supplemental Indenture from
becoming effective and binding). The Trustee shall deliver to the Board proof of the
mailing of such notice. A record, consisting of the information required or permitted by
this Section to be delivered by or to the Trustee, shall be proOf of the matters therein
stated.
