Resolution Approving Group 1 of Facilities Master Plan
Mr. Corrigan moved approval of the following resolution.
Mr. Parker seconded the motion, which passed unanimously
by roll call vote.
WHEREAS, On June 19, 2018, the Board of Library
Trustees authorized the Library to enter into an
agreement with Bialosky and Partners, Architects, LLC
for architectural design services for the creation of a
facilities master plan. Bialosky proceeded by obtaining
community feedback, and analyzing the state of existing
facilities, their current usage and how the facilities
support the library’s plans for the future; and
WHEREAS, Bialosky completed a draft of the facilities
master plan (“Master Plan”) which it submitted to the
Library in March of 2019 for review. The Master Plan
provides options for the renovation, expansion,
consolidation, or relocation of all of the Library’s
buildings over the next decade in order to meet the
Library’s long term goals. An implementation plan has
also been created as part of the Master Plan,
recommending that the entire Master Plan be phased in
and that a certain number of facilities improvements be
implemented initially as a part of Group 1, in order to
allow the Library to work within a responsible budget
necessary to support the financing for the projects; and

 620

WHEREAS, The Master Plan recommends that the following
branches and work be included in Group 1: Dr. Martin

Pleasant branch at new location; and
WHEREAS, The Master Plan estimates that the total cost
of the Group 1 buildings will be $62,000,000, and
recommends that the work be conducted over a five year
period; and
WHEREAS, This Board, upon due consideration of the
Master Plan and the recommendation of its Capital
Committee, has determined that implementation of Group 1
of the Master Plan serves the needs of the community in
an equitable manner and moves the Library forward
towards its strategic priority of being ready for the
future; now therefore be it
RESOLVED, That the Board of Library Trustees hereby
approves the selection of the branches in Group 1 of the
Master Plan and the approves the recommended types of
improvements for each branch, and authorizes the
Executive Director, CEO and the Chief Operating Officer,
and their designee(s), to begin the implementation
process by obtaining designs, costs estimates, and
establishing schedules; be it further
RESOLVED, That the Board also authorizes the Executive
Director, CEO and the Chief Operating Officer, or their
designee(s) to begin exploring property acquisition for
the Woodland, Mount Pleasant/E. 131st Street, MemorialNottingham and South Brooklyn branches, and to also
explore the potential sale and development of the
Lakeshore property; be it further
RESOLVED, That the Board also authorizes the Executive
Director, CEO and his designees, to enter into such

 621

agreements as may be necessary, including those over
$25,000, to effectuate the implementation and
exploration process as described in this Resolution.
Ms. Washington thanked staff for their hard work
providing thorough information at the Capital Committee
Work Session and asked the record to reflect that as the
plan is rolled out, it should be combined with the work
that Ms. Winlock is doing to ensure that diversity and
inclusion goals are a part of our RFP’s and everything
issued as a part of this. Ms. Washington stressed that
this continues throughout the process and these things
are aligned with each other.
Director Thomas asked Ms. Winlock and Mr. Swetel to
explain what has been done to make those timelines more
even.
Mr. Swetel stated that the organization has reached a
significant milestone by approving Phase 1 of the Master
Plan and thanked the Board for their commitment in the
process.
Mr. Swetel stated that the Library is committed to
supplier diversity and making sure that those timelines
come together. Ms. Winlock arranged a meeting with
Casandra Johnson with whom staff met.
Mr. Hairston asked for background on Ms. Johnson.
Ms. Winlock stated that Ms. Johnson is currently a
consultant and is the former director of construction
for University Hospital for eight years. Ms. Johnson
led University Hospital’s Vision 2010 plan around
construction and supplier diversity.
Ms. Winlock stated that the Library is currently in the
process of engaging Ms. Johnson.
Mr. Swetel stated Ms. Johnson is determined to make sure
that the Library has the best program possible.
Mr. Swetel gave an overview of the following goals: (1)
Ensuring that there is language in our RFQ’s that go out
guaranteeing that we are attracting the best inclusive
group that reflects the diversity of the professional
community for design services for the first 13 branches;

 622

and (2) Within the next 90 days, establish a Supplier a
Diversity Council and work on our Education Program.
Our plan is to take a thoughtful approach to be as
inclusive as possible and setting the standard in
Northeast Ohio for diversity and inclusion.
Ms. Winlock stated that we have asked Ms. Johnson to
present the Library with a proposal for the short term
goals to engage her on how we develop language around
our RFQ’s as well as the language that should be
incorporated in our agreement with Panzica around
diversity and inclusion. We would also like to engage
her to help identify individuals, in addition to the
Board to participate on our Diversity Council who will
help us develop a policy that will be presented and
recommended to the Board for consideration and approval.
Once that has been completed, we will be able to build
our strategy that will drive the Master Plan. Those
timelines have been aligned.
Ms. Washington wanted to be clear that this would also
include not only the RFQ but handling the responses that
come in.
Ms. Winlock stated that Ms. Johnson will help us build
all of those processes from beginning to end.
Ms. Winlock stated that she was excited about the
education component and explained that as the People’s
University and trying to create a learning environment.
Ms. Johnson spoke about engaging minority suppliers and
providing education opportunities on how to do business
with the Library as well as educate them on how to grow
their own businesses.
Mr. Swetel introduced Ben Crabtree and Aaron Hill from
Bialosky who was available to answer any questions the
Board may have had.
Mr. Hairston expressed that he will need additional
information regarding decisions for Memorial Nottingham.
Mr. Hairston noted the following: the building is
beautiful but expensive; there are no parking issues; on
the bus line; patrons are senior citizens from
surrounding apartments and students from nearby schools.
Mr. Hairston stated that he would approve this with the

 623

understanding that the Board be involved in any future
decisions about the building.
Mr. Corrigan expressed that the entire Board supports
Mr. Hairston’s request and it is proper fiduciary care
on the part of the Board to make sure that this is done
very appropriately. In consideration of our values both
as a library and as an entity in the City of Cleveland.
Director Thomas stated that considering the history of
the building, value of the space and the politics
involved, it is essential that the Board is involved in
this process as much as it can possibly be.
Mr. Corrigan thanked Bialosky and its principals for
helping the Library get to this point. Mr. Corrigan
stated that the Library is being very careful, as it has
in the past, over taxpayer funds and dividing the
Capital Plan into two phases. Given what libraries have
endured in the past, whether they be state budget
changes, the impact the foreclosure crisis had on
property values in our tax base, Mr. Corrigan commended
staff, community leaders and Bialosky for making the
fact and appearance of how we are doing this fairly
evident for selection of locations and the types of
projects in Phase 1.
Mr. Parker stated that he approved the plans for East
131st Street and Mount Pleasant and shared how it would
benefit the residents and schools in the communities.

Business.

RESOLUTION
ESTABLISHING
POLICY FOR
DIVERSITY,
EQUITY, AND
INCLUSION
Approved

Resolution Establishing Policy for Diversity, Equity,
and Inclusion
(See page 769)
Mr. Corrigan moved approval of the following resolution.
Mr. Hairston seconded the motion, which passed
unanimously by roll call vote.
WHEREAS, Cleveland Public Library recognizes that
diversity, equity and inclusion are mutually reinforcing
and must be woven through the Library’s vision, mission,
values, strategic priorities, goals, and objectives; and
WHEREAS, Over the last seven years, the Library has
strategically readied itself for the future and is now
set to embark on a bold plan to position the Cleveland
Public Library as the center of learning in each of the
neighborhood communities we serve; and

 630

WHEREAS, The Library wishes to adopt a formal policy on
diversity, equity, and inclusion to guide its
deliberations, decisions, and actions as the plan
becomes a reality; now therefore be it
RESOLVED, That the Board of Library Trustees adopts the
attached policy, to be effective immediately.
Sadie Winlock, Director, Equity & Inclusion Initiatives,
stated that she gave a presentation at the Capital
Committee Work Session on Saturday, April 13, 2019, that
included a recommendation for the Library’s Policy on
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.
Ms. Winlock explained that over the last several months,
she interviewed several Chief Diversity Officers, Chief
Executive Officers, and other leaders in the community
about how they would define diversity, equity and
inclusion to help us understand what we need to do as an
organization. As a result of those conversations, staff
has made a recommendation resulting in this policy
drafted for Board consideration and approval.
Ms. Winlock stated that diversity can be considered an
umbrella with the following pillars under it: (1) Our
Employees, (2) Our Patrons; and (3) Supplier Diversity,
This policy addresses the first two pillars. We will be
working with Mr. Swetel and Ms. Johnson on the third
pillar.
Ms. Rodriguez thanked Ms. Winlock for her work on this
initiative.
Mr. Hairston stated that after 150 years which we are
now celebrating, we have a Diversity, Equity & Inclusion
Policy. Mr. Hairston congratulated and thanked Director
Thomas, the Board, and staff for their vision and their
work to establish this important policy that will open
the doors of “The Peoples University” making it possible
for many people who otherwise would not be involved.
Director Thomas thanked Ms. Winlock and stated that the
Library has not had an aggressive plan that addresses
how diversity fits into every aspect of the
organization. This piece must fit into our Strategic
Plan to ensure that it is a part of everything we do as
an organization.

 631

Ms. Washington commended his starting point and stated
that it is unfortunate that organizations still must
celebrate moments like these when this should be the
normal way we do business. Now that the policy is in
writing and has been approved, Ms. Washington stated
that she looks forward to seeing the actual strategy
behind it and receiving regular reports on the progress
of the Library and the results on what has been
identified in this Resolution.
Ms. Winlock stated that our next steps will be similar
to Supplier Diversity Council which will be the
development of a DEI Committee. The Board is invited to
participate in the DEI Committee to help us determine
how we do this work and build an education program.
Mr. Corrigan stated that this was an appropriate
improved sophistication of what this Library should be
doing. Mr. Corrigan noted that Main and Louis Stokes
Wing was easily the most successful diversity, equity
and inclusive public construction projects in the City
of Cleveland for more than 20 years. In fact, we
exceeded our goals so much that other entities that were
building buildings did not report their outcomes because
they could not come close to the Library’s outcomes.
This is building on a tradition when we named this
building Louis Stokes we took seriously then. The $62
million is the first large pot of money where we can
expect to impact construction and suppliers. In the
interim, we have done things to continue what this
building itself has established as our tradition.
Mr. Corrigan stated that he was very grateful to Ms.
Winlock and staff for all that they have done to take us
to the next level and make sure that we’ve set standards
and a bar for ourselves that is as high as our tradition
has asked for.
Ms. Rodriguez requested that future Board Meeting
agendas include a Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Update
provided by Sadie Winlock, Director, Equity & Inclusion
Initiatives.

out to a local family. The patron didn’t know the
full details of the story until he was sent the
articles.

Fine Arts to try to find articles from the early
20th century dealing with apartment designs. The
online version of the Avery Index to Architectural
Periodicals is a paid database that select
institutions have. Youngstown is not one of them so
her only option was either to go to Kent State

of the City Club of Cleveland by locating and
scanning to PDF selections of microfilm transcripts
from City Club Forum speeches of the 1920s to aid
in the patron’s research for a book he is writing.

relationship with this patron and continues to
assist him with further research.
In a group effort, the Government Documents
Department provided information for an Australian
researcher looking for any information on a
Cleveland-based radio tube business. The Business,
Economics and Labor Department forwarded the
request for a patent to Government Documents.
Although the information provided by the researcher
was inaccurate, Government Documents Supervisor
Sarah Dobransky was able to find the company’s
patent, issued to a different inventor than the one
listed by the researcher. Using the print index
from 1932 and the company’s name, Ms. Dobransky was
able to locate the correct inventor and use that
information to find the patent number. The online
PubEAST version of the patent had technical issues
with the original scan and was unable to be read.
Therefore, Ms. Dobransky had to rely on the
original microfilm reels to retrieve the
information.
Additionally, as part of the library’s Patent and
Trademark Resource Center (PTRC) program, Science
and Technology Senior Librarian Jim Bettinger had

Mullee provided a patron with a selection of
Sherwin-Williams annual report information (19771980) that the department has on microfiche.
Business, Economics and Labor Librarian Zachary Hay
researched historical information related to a
florist company originating in Cleveland in the
late 1890s named G.W. Mercer, Inc. Resources
consulted included the 1914 and 1916 volumes of
American Florist Company's directory of florists,
nurserymen and seedsmen of the United States and
Canada (CPL is the ONLY Ohio public library to own
these); and the 1955-1957 editions of the Midwest
Florist Directory (CPL is the ONLY library in

library to own this series.
A Science and Technology customer requested
information regarding the Harshaw Chemical Company,
especially any current information from the US Army

the Former Harshaw Chemical Site, Cleveland, OH
from the US Army Corps of Engineers (2011) was also
helpful, and CPL is the ONLY library in WorldCat to
own this resource.
PAL staff assisted patrons with ordinance questions
related to water bill rates, street dedication,
dogs and Ohio State University and Parkworks
agreement.

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & CLEVNET
The CLEVNET Executive Panel held its first regular
meeting of the year on March 14, 2019, at Twinsburg
Public Library. This was the first Panel meeting for two
new regional representatives: Molly Carver of Sandusky
Library and Laura Leonard, the director at Twinsburg.

 674

Most of the meeting’s discussion focused on the first
reports being shared from ConnectWise Manage, CLEVNET’s
new business management platform that replaced a less
sophisticated help desk ticketing system in the third
quarter of 2018. CLEVNET purchased ConnectWise Manage in
response to one of the primary recommendations made by
GFOA (Government Finance Officers Association) in their
CLEVNET-commissioned 2017 report, CLEVNET Price Model
Analysis: Recommended Updates to Current Pricing Model.
GFOA worked closely with Carrie Krenicky, CPL’s Chief
Financial Officer, who headed a special pricing model
review work group made up of fiscal officers and
directors from five other CLEVNET-member libraries. The
work group was formed in July 2015 as one of the action
steps from CLEVNET’s 2014 strategic planning retreats.
In their report, GFOA recommended that CLEVNET
“implement a tracking system to help log and track
helpdesk calls, tickets, and technician onsite and
offsite activity” to replace the old ticketing system
that made it “difficult to determine the cost and types
of support that CLEVNET provides its members.” GFOA
further recommended that “after there is sufficient
helpdesk data, to review and analyze the data so CLEVNET
and the member library systems have a thorough
understanding of the services provided.”
GFOA made these recommendations in response to the
concerns of some work group members “regarding the types
of services CLEVNET is responsible for and whether or
not CLEVNET IT staff is providing services beyond the
scope of the contractual agreement. Some library systems
also believe the cause of rising membership costs is due
to the greater demand by some libraries on CLEVNET’s IT
resources.”
Hilary Prisbylla, Director of CLEVNET, presented the
Connect Wise Manage reports to the Executive Panel. She
explained that IT/CLEVNET staff made every effort to
channel their work through the new system, beginning
August 14, 2018, to capture all communication with the
member libraries. But some things were not captured,
mostly from CPL staff members who are accustomed to
calling or stopping in the department. Another large
piece of the puzzle, not captured in the data, is the
time IT/CLEVNET staff spend on CPL’s maintenance
agreements and procuring hardware, software, licenses,

 675

etc., for CPL. The procurement process is still driven
by paper forms at CPL. Even though all of the data
related to CPL as a contributing member library were not
captured, the number of hours spent on CPL tickets by
CLEVNET’s computer networking technicians constituted 53
percent of their total documented hours during the sixmonth period, 8/14/2018-2/14/2019. This number stands in
sharp contrast to the hours spent on CPL by the Network
staff and the ILS team: 17 percent and 22 percent,
respectively; numbers that are in line with the time
CLEVNET staff should be spending on CPL. The percentage
spent on CPL by CLEVNET’s technicians is clearly “beyond
the scope,” confirming the concerns raised during the
pricing model project. No other CLEVNET member library
relies on CLEVNET staff to be its de facto IT
department. The larger member libraries have three to
five staff members dedicated to the work. Some of the
smaller libraries in the same geographic region share
the cost of a computer technician. At least one library
uses a consultant.
After analyzing the data and much discussion, the
Executive Panel asked Timothy Diamond, CPL’s liaison to
CLEVNET and member of the Panel, to work with CPL’s
Executive Team to address the issue of CPL’s
disproportionate reliance on CLEVNET’s computer
networking technicians. The Executive Panel recognizes
that the transition will not happen overnight, but it is
time for CPL to conform with the new pricing model which
is tied to the amended and restated CLEVNET System
Agreement and the new CLEVNET Operating Procedures,
adopted last year. The Panel expects CPL to establish
its own IT department, or find other means, to provide
the IT services that it needs that are “beyond the
scope” of the services CLEVNET staff provide to all
member libraries. The expectation of the Panel is that
this transition process will be clearly defined and
ready for implementation by September 2019 when the 2020
budget for CLEVNET will be drafted.
The next quarterly of the CLEVNET Directors will be held
on Friday, April 26, at 10:00 a.m., at Madison Public
Library in Madison, Ohio.

CLEVELAND PUBLIC LffiRARY INVESTMENT POLICY

I.

Introduction

The plll]lose of this investment policy is to establish priorities and guidelines regarding the
investment management of the Library's investment funds [hereinafter referred to as the
"Portfolio" (section II)] and the Library's endowment funds [hereinafter referred to as the
"Endowments" (section III)]. Overall priorities and guidelines for the Portfolio are based upon
Ohio Revised Code Chapter 135.14 and prudent money management. Guidelines for the
Endowments are based upon Ohio Revised Code Chapter 2109.37 and 2109.371 as delineated by
a 1975 Cuyahoga County Probate Court Order and a ruling from the Cuyahoga County
Prosecutor's Office.
The effective date of this policy is April 18, 2019 and represents a revision to the previously
submitted policy, June 16, 2016. It is the fifth revision to the original submitted policy dated June
17, 2000 (1" revision September 18, 2003; 2nd revision September 15, 2005; 3ro revision March
20, 2014; 41h revision June 16, 2016). This policy includes [totally or partially] sections of the
statute in order to describe eligible investments. In some sections, the policy places further limits
upon the use of eligible investments or investment transactions.

II.

The Portfolio

A.

Investment Objectives

The investment objectives of the Portfolio, in priority order, include:
I.

2.

Compliance with all Federal and State laws

Safety of principal

Safety of principal is the most important objective. The investment of Library funds shall
be conducted in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital within the context of the
· following criteria:
Credit Risk

Credit risk is the risk of loss due to the failure of a security issuer to pay principal or interest, or
the failure of the issuer to make timely payments of principal or interest. Eligible investments,
pursuant to Chapter 135.14 ORC, affected by credit risk include certificates of deposit, commercial
paper, and bankers acceptances. Credit risk will be minimized by (1) diversifying assets by issuer;
(2) ensuring that required, minimum credit quality ratings exist prior to the purchase of commercial
paper and bankers acceptances; and (3) maintaining adequate collateralization of certific ates of
deposit and other deposit accounts pursuant to the method as determined by the Fiscal Officer.

Revised: April18, 2019

Page 1

 685

Market risk

The market value of securities in the Library's portfolio will increase or decrease based upon
changes in the general level of interest rates. The effects of market value fluctuations will be
mitigated by (1) maintenance of adequate liquidity so that current obligations can be met without
a sale of securities; (2) diversification of maturities; (3) diversification of assets.
3.

Liquidity

The portfolio shall remain sufficiently liquid to meet all current obligations of the
Library. Minimum liquidity levels [as a percentage of average investable funds]
may be established in order to meet all curren t obligations. The portfolio may also
be structured so that securities mature concurrently with cash needs.
4.

Yield

The portfolio shall be managed to consistently attain a market rate of return
throughout budgetary and economic cycles. Whenever possible, and consistent
with risk limitations and prudent investment management, the Library will seek to
augment returns above the market average through the implementation of active
portfolio management strategies.

B.

Authorized Investments (itemized)

-U.S. Treasury Bills, Notes, and Bonds; various federal agency securities including issues
of Federal National Mortgage Assn. (FNMA), Federal Home Loao Mortgage Corp. (FHLMC),
Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB), Federal Farm Credit Bank (FFCB), Government National
Mortgage Association (GNMA), and other agencies or instrumentalities of the United States.
Eligible investments include securities that may be "called" [by the issuer] prior to the final
maturity date. Any eligible investment may be purchased at a premium or a discount. All federal
agency securities shall be direct issuances of federal government agencies or instrumentalities.
-Interim deposits in the eligible institutions applying for interim moneys as provided in
Section 135.08 ORC:
-No-load money market mutual funds, as defmed in 135.14(B)(5), rated in the highest
category by at least one nationally recognized ratin:g agency, investing exclusively in the same
types of eligible securities as defined in Division B(1) or B(2) under 135.14 ORC, and repurchase
agreements secured by such obligations. Eligible money market funds shall comply with 135.01
ORC, regarding limitations and restrictions.
-Repurchase agreements with any eligible institution mentioned in section !35.03 ORC, or
any eligible securities dealer pursuant to (M) of 135.14 ORC of this section, except that such
eligible securities dealers shall be restricted toprimary government securities dealers. Repurchase
agreements will settle on a delivery vs payment basis with repo collateral held at a qualified
custodian or agent, designated by the Library. Eligible repo collateral is restricted to securities

listed in division (B)( I) or (B)(2) under 135.14 ORC. The market value of securities subjectto a
repurchase agreement must exceed the principal value of the repo amount by at least 2%. Prior to
the execution of any repo transaction, a master repurchase agreement will be signed by the Library
and the eligible parties.
-Commercial paper notes issued by companies incorporated under the laws of the United
States and bankers acceptances issued by any domestic bank rated in the highest category by a
nationally recognized rating agency; specific limitations regarding the investment in co=ercial

the maintenance and growth of the funds are the primary objectives.

The Library's ability to

achieve these returns will depend upon the acceptance of moderate risk, recognizing that a
reasonable degree of volatility in market value is necessary to achieve long-term capital
appreciation.

0-20%

15%

The midpoints of the above ranges will be considered the long-term or policy allocation.
Any deviations beyond this mix of securities must have prior approval by the Board of Library
Trustees.

Allocations to cash equivalents are to be considered a subset of the Fixed Income

allocation along with Convertible Assets.
Within the above ranges, the Library's Endowment Fund Manager will make all tactical
asset allocation decisions (over-and-under-weights).

Deviations outside of the above ranges

require prior approval from the Library.

education, and professional development;

•

Creating a safe workplace environment in which em ployees' voices can be
included, heard, valued, and treated with respect;

•

Developing and implementing programs and services that incorporate the
differences that make us a community, ensuring fair and equitable
treatment with access to appropriate resources and opportunities; and

•

Developing a supplier diversity program that mirrors the patrons we serve.
