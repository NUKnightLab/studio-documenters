Legislative Update

State

More than 6,200 bills and resolutions have been filed in the House and Senate.
Governor Pritzker delivered his first budget address on February 20.

The Governor spoke the about the continued challenges presented by Illinois? structural deficit and the need to
implement a "fair tax?, or a graduated income tax, where higher earners would pay more, as opposed to the
flat income tax system in place today.

For the state ?scal year 2020 budget, Pritzker proposed $1.18 in new revenues including an assessment on
health insurers, which includes Medicaid managed care plans; regulating recreational marijuana; an expanded
tax on video gaming and regulating Sports betting; a new e-cigarette tax as well as increasing the existing
cigarette tax and capping the retailer?s discbunt; a new plastic bag tax; and phasing out the private school

scholarship credit.

The proposed budget is mostly a maintenance budget, but includes modest increases to early

childhood education, public universities and community colleges, Monetary Award Program (MAP) and
Aspirational Institutional Match Helping Illinois Grow Higher Education (AIM HIGH) college financial assistance
and scholarship programs, as well as increasing eligibility for the child care assistance program.

At the health and human services agency budget brie?ngs, the Department of Health and Family Services (HFS)
shared that their FY2020 budget assumes that more than 75% of Medicaid bene?ciaries statewide will be in
managed care, includes funding for new positions to support behavioral health, and that Integrated Health
Homes (IHHs) will start in the new ?scal year, specific date TBA.

The Illinois Department of Human Services? (DHS) budget includes additional funding for expanded child care
assistance eligibility (to 200% FPL), and an additional to offset the increased costs to vendors due to the

state minimum wage increase.

The Illinois Department of Public Health?s (IDPH) budget includes an additional to address childhood lead
poisoning, in continued capital funding to remove sources of lead exposure from homes of children with
elevated blood lead levels, and flat funding of the local health protection grants, which fund and other

state-certi?ed local health departments.

More details about the Governor? 5 proposed FY2020 budget can be found on the State's Office of Budget and
Management website 

Governor Pritzker announced that Ramon Gardenhire will serve as the Governor?s Deputy Chief of Staff for
Policy. Ramon most recently worked for the AIDS Foundation of Chicago as the vice president of policy.

Dr. Ngoze Ezike has been appointed to serve as the Director of the Illinois Department of Public Health. Dr. Ezike
is a board?certified internist and pediatrician who has practiced at CCH for more than 15 years. She most
recently served as an attending physician at the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center. Dr. Ezike?s appointment

requires Senate confirmation.

Grace Hou has been appointed to serve as the Secretary of the Illinois Department of Human Services (DHS).
DHS administers a number of public benefits programs, including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance
Program (SNAP), the Women, Infants, and Children Program (WIC), as well as cash assistance. Ms. Hou currently

serves as President of Woods Fund Chicago and previously served as an Assistant Secretary at DHS from 2003
through 2012. Her appointment requires Senate confirmation.

On February 19, Governor Pritzker signed legislation that will increase the state?s minimum wage to $15/hour by
January 1, 2025. The legislation passed with partisan support. Senate Majority Leader Kimberly Lightford and
Representative Will Guzzarcli led this effort in their respective chambers. An overview of federal, state, and local
minimum wages follows:

0 The federal minimum wage is $7.25/hour and was last increased in 2009.

0 Illinois? current minimum wage is $8.25/hour and was last increased in 2010.
The minimum wage in Chicago is $12/hour (tipped employees earn This will increase to
SIS/hour on July 1, 2019.

The minimum wage in suburban Cook County is $11/hour (tipped employees earn This will
increase to SlZ/hour starting July 1, 2019 and to $13/hour on July 1, 2020. Suburban Cook County
municipalities may opt out of adopting the minimum wage increases, and many have done 50.

Governor Pritzker and Lt. Governor Juliana Stratton published 11 transition reports that outline
recommendations on a variety of subjects. Transition committee members and the full reports, including the
Healthy Children and Families report (which CCH Board of Director David Ernesto Munar and former CCH Deputy
CEO for Finance and Strategy Doug Elwell contributed to), can be viewed online -
.

For the last month, Washington has been consumed with the longest ever lapse in appropriations, which
resulted in the longest-ever partial government shutdown. From December 22, 2018 to January 25, 2019, nine
cabinet agencies, the Executive Office of the President, the Federal Judiciary and most independent agencies
were closed, except for essential or emergency workers, over an impasse on funding for a southern border wall.
On January 25, the President and Congress agreed to a three-week continuing resolution - a stop-gap funding
measure to keep the affected agencies operating at the previous year?s funding levels. The House and Senate
then approved a compromise measure to fund the affected agencies, which the President signed on February 14
despite being unsatisfied with the level of funding for the wall. The next day the President declared a national
emergency in order to redirect funds to the wall project.

As Congress emerges from shutdown crisis mode and the committees have been populated with new leaders
and members, legislative and oversight work has begun.

State of the Union AIDS Initiative On February 5, the President addressed a joint session of Congress on the
State of the Union. The speech, usually held in January, had been delayed due to the shutdown. Significantly, the
President announced an ambitious initiative to end the epidemic in the United States by 2030. The
plan aims to cut the infection rate by 75 percent in five years and 90 percent in the next 10 years. The plan
promises to direct new resources to 48 counties; Washington, San Juan, Puerto Rico and seven largely
southern states which account for most new infections. Cook County is one of the 48 counties on the target list.

If approved by Congress, the plan would fund increasing investments in geographic hotspots through existing
programs, such as the Ryan White Program, and a new program through community health centers
that would provide to people with the highest risk of infection. It would also support using data to identify
where HIV is spreading the fastest in order to guide prevention, care and treatment actions at the local level.
Finally, it would also fund the creation of a local HIV "HealthForce" in the targeted communities.

Additional details of the proposal are expected in the President?s FY 2020 budget request.

a Budget and Appropriations Due to the delay finishing the FY 2019 appropriations bills, the FY 2020 cycle is also
getting off to a slow start. The President usually sends the budget request for the next ?scal year to Congress in
the ?rst week in February. This year the White House has indicated that it will come in two parts, with the
President?s budget message and top priorities going out in the second week of March and the detailed proposals
for each agency with the budget tables and justifications going out a week or so later. At least some of this delay
can be attributed to the shutdown, which affected the White House Office Of Management and Budget, as well

as budget staff in the shuttered agencies.

With the House and Senate divided along party lines, it is hard to see how they would advance a budget
resolution to guide the FY 2020 appropriations process, but they could avoid the need to do so by adopting
legislation to lift the statutory caps on discretionary spending which were imposed by the Budget Control Act of
2011. Without action to lift those caps, spending across the defense and non-defense discretionary accounts
would cut by more than 10 percent, an outcome that neither party wants. The operative principle in these deals
over the past several years has been parity for defense and non-defense, which the parties are likely to continue
to adhere to. Last year, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 was the vehicle to lift the caps as well as to m0ve
some other priority items, including a delay of the cuts to Medicaid DSH imposed by the ACA.

In addition to the need to agree to FY 2020 spending levels, Congress will need to take action to raise the debt
ceiling. The current ceiling expires on March 1. Debates over the debt ceiling have often been opportunities for
brinksmanship, although last year's budget deal included the provision to raise it until March 1.

a Texas v. United States On February 14, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals granted the US. House of
Representatives? request to intervene in the lawsuit to defend the ACA. The Fifth Circuit also allowed four
additional states Colorado, Iowa, Michigan and Nevada to join the other Democratic states (including Illinois)
defending the health law. The Circuit Court denied the parties? request to expedite proceedings to July, ensuring
that uncertainty over the constitutionality of the law will carry well into the 2020 election campaign season.
While many legal believe the Fifth Circuit wiil overturn the District Court on the merits, the case is likely

to end up before the US. Supreme Court.

0 Medicaid In addition to efforts to delay the statutory Medicaid DSH cuts, we are monitoring a number of
Medicaid actions in the states.

0 On February 4, the Idaho Supreme Court upheld the state?s Medicaid expansion, which was approved by 61
percent of the voters in a statewide ballot initiative. This clears the way for the state to implement the ACA

expansion in Idaho.

0 On February 11, the Governor of Utah signed a bill which would replace the full ACA Medicaid expansion
which had been approved by voters in the Novemberelection with a partial expansion, covering only those
up to 100 percent of the federal poverty limit. If CMS does not grant the state the waiver for a partial
expansion, the legislation triggers an automatic-full expansion, but with work requirements. CMS has not to

date approved a partial expansion under the ACA.

The Nebraska legislature is currently debating how to fund the expansion, which was also approved by the
state?s voters in November.

0 The Governor of Georgia has signaled that he would support a partial expansion with some conditions.

Senator Doug Jones (D-Ala.) and Representative Terry Sewell (D-Ala.) have both introduced legislation to entice the
remaining non-expansion states into the expansion by offering them the same enhanced federal match that was in

the ACA for the first three years of expansion.

Protection of Medicaid remains a key priority for CCH at both the State and Federal level.

 Tobacco Use
Background
• Tobacco use is the largest preventable cause of disease, disability, and death in the U.S.1
• Annual health care costs in Illinois directly caused by tobacco are $5.49 billion and $5.27 billion in
lost productivity2
• In suburban Cook County, 16.7% of adults identify as current smokers3
• E-cigarettes are currently the most used tobacco product among youths4
• In the last year, e-cigarette use in the U.S. has increased by 78% among high school students and
48% among middle school students5
• E-cigarette use increases the risk for using cigarettes among youths6

62 of 100

3

 Vaping
• E-cigarette liquid contains chemicals and carcinogens; +/- nicotine, +/- marijuana
• E-cigarette liquid can poison children through ingestion or skin absorption
• Youth who use e-cigarettes are more likely to use cigarettes or other tobacco products7, 8
• Major American professional societies (AAFP, AAP, APHA) urge tighter regulation and more
research
•

None support the use of e-cigarettes for quitting

• Recent large study demonstrated e-cigarettes were more effective for smoking cessation than
conventional methods9, however:
•

Of those who maintained abstinence at 52 weeks, 80% (n=79) were still using e-cigarettes

•

Another recent study demonstrated a higher risk of stroke and heart attack among e-cigarette users10

SerVIce Accessibility Issues For

Vulnerable Communities

 COOK COUNTY

  HEALTH

 

Consolidation effect
The most vulnerable are most impacted by these changes
System consolidation is creating “access deserts” in vulnerable communities.
Independent hospitals struggle
• Decreasing trends in inpatient utilization
• Community choices

• Funding streams changing
• larger systems show no interest in acquiring them

85 Of 100 Cook County Zip Codes Inpatient Capacity is more than sufficient
 In line with the national trend, inpatient utilization for all Illinois hospitals has declined
steadily.
 Inpatient utilization dropped across all Illinois hospitals dropped from 2013 -2017.

• 4% for all IL hospitals
• 12% for Safety Net hospitals
 Median inpatient occupancy of staffed beds across all hospitals in Illinois is 46% (2016).

 Safety net occupancy rates are similar despite significant recent reductions in staffed beds.
 Academic health centers and large non-profits have seen higher occupancy rates

IL Hospital Assessment
Program Transformation

 COOK COUNTY

  HEALTH

 

Hospital Assessment Program
History
• Since 2014, a portion of those funds flow through Managed Care
Organizations (had been in add-ons under fee-for-service)
• Significant proportion of state payments in Medicaid program
generated by the program
• Why CMS wanted it to change

• Since 2018, significantly more dollars flowed into rate payments from
MCOs

88 of 100

14

 Shifting Assessment Dollars to Claims Payment
Impact of the 2018 spring assessment law
• The law allowed the Department of Healthcare and Family Services to convert $635
million in hospital assessment-funded static payments to claims based payments
effective July 1, 2018 (“Phase I”).
• For some low Medicaid-volume safety nets, this resulted in a net reduction of millions of
dollars in revenue.
• The law authorizes the Department to move additional dollars from program to claims
based payments effective July 1, 2020 (“Phase II”).

• Additional transformation will move increasing amounts of dollars to claims-based
payments (“follow the patient”).
• These challenges pose significant challenges to low volume hospitals.
89 of 100

15

 The Hospital Transformation Fund
Another dimension of the 2018 assessment law
• $262 million dollars of current Medicaid funds currently go to a subset of hospitals as static “transition
payments”
• The law designated these dollars be available as a transformation pool hospitals may apply for receiving
in 2020
• The strategy is that safety net hospitals would transform in ways that bring value to CMS and the
community
• Criteria for transformation funding discussed but currently at a standstill
• Providers, IL Health and Hospital Association, IL Healthcare and Family Services, legislative workgroup
will need to find consensus

 What is a Safety Net Hospital?
Defined by 305 ILCS 5/5-5e.1
(Criteria for safety-net hospital status)
A Safety-net hospital is an Illinois hospital that:
• (a) Is licensed by the Department of Public Health as a general acute care or pediatric hospital, and
• (b) Is a Disproportionate Share hospital, as described in Section 1923 of the federal Social Security Act
and
• Meets one of the following criteria:
• (c) Has a Medicaid inpatient utilization rate (MIUR) of at least 40% and a charity percent of at least
4%, or
• (d) Has a MIUR of at least 50%
• “Beginning July 1, 2012 and ending on June 30, 2018, a hospital that would have qualified for the
rate year beginning October 1, 2011, shall be a Safety-Net Hospital.“
*MIUR=Medicaid inpatient utilization rate

(Medicaid insured days/total inpatient days)

 The Net Impact of Trends
These trends will combine to severely threaten independent safety nets:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

The ongoing national decline in inpatient services
Lack of outpatient capacity
Movement of funds to claims based payments
Very low number of staffed beds
Challenges with maintaining a deep medical staff
Alternative payment models based on outcomes
Emphasis on the full continuum of care including social determinants

The only system with a willingness to embrace these communities is CCH.

Strategic Recommendations

 COOK COUNTY

  HEALTH

 

What is Needed? What can CCH uniquely provide?
• We have a broad, deep, dedicated medical staff that is mission-aligned
• We have a shared, mature electronic health record, and increasing ability to
integrate within that system.

• We have invested in technology over time.
• We have a well of trust in the communities we serve.

 What is Needed? What can CCH uniquely provide?
CCH can provide the full continuum of care
• Specialty care
• Chronic disease management
• High end diagnostics
• Addressing the social determinants of health
• Robust care coordination

97 of 100

23

 Multi-Specialty Practice Groups
On the rise nationally-why?
1. Better communication among your physicians. Seeing aligned doctors promotes collaboration and ensures more
efficient care. Medical groups utilize a common EHRs that facilitate sharing of information. Improved communication helps
improve outcomes.
2. Access to new treatments and technology. Not only will do MSPGs provide access to additional physicians and
experts, but increased access to new treatments and technologies as well. Integrated medical groups combine the assets of a
particular health care organization.
3. Coordinated care. Integrated medical groups employ physicians who practice in hospital and ambulatory settings,
mitigating potential disruption in care when being admitted or discharged. Working as a team improves efficiency and
quality.
4. Higher standards of quality monitoring. Integrated medical groups have more resources to devote to monitoring
and improving the care provided.
5. Additional clinical resources. As part of a broader health system, physicians in an integrated group can draw on a
wider array of clinical services. These may include things like home care, diabetes education, smoking cessation, cardiac
rehabilitation, and others. It's no longer just visiting your doctor when you are sick.

24

 Strategic Recommendations
Where do we go from here?
• We must be prepared for stressors in hospital environment.
• Economics of Medicaid will continue to cause challenges for privates and not-for-profits, but in
perhaps unpredictable ways.

• The communities with vulnerable populations more likely need access to specialty and diagnostic
services (perhaps Urgent Care) more than acute care hospital beds.
• We will need to significantly improve access to specialty and diagnostic services.
• We will need to develop technologic innovations to assist in services to patients in areas
poorly served by public transportation, including telemedicine and care coordination.
• We must improve the patient experience as we must have revenue from insured patients to
offset the costs of our system.

• We do not have an infinite capacity for Charity Care
