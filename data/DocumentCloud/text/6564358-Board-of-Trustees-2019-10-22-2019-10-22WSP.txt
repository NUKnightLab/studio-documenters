FINANCIAL ANALYSIS AND ECONOMIC
FORECAST FOR THE GREATER
CLEVELAND REGIONAL TRANSIT
AUTHORITY
October 22, 2019

 Our Approach: 6 Research Questions
1.

How does RTA compare to its peers?

2. What are the economic and political risks RTA faces?
3. What are the financial issues RTA faces?
2

4. What potential efficiencies could increase financial
performance, and what strategies could maximize revenue?
5. What are current Key Performance Indicators and what
processes and/or other indicators can be implemented?
6. What are current and potential future local funding
mechanisms for transit? How could state and federal funding
affect the RTA’s finances?

 Background: RTA ridership has declined faster than regional
population’s decrease.
-4%
-2%

-31%

 Background: Employment in the region has shifted
away from downtown and other areas served by rail

 1) RTA’s operating costs are generally close to peer average
Administrative & paratransit costs are much higher than peers
1.

Labor costs (wages and fringe) are well-contained

2.

Bus Rapid Transit performance is very efficient across all metrics

3.

Rail service costs are lower than average, but service offered is not in
line with ridership

5

4. Administrative costs appear higher than peers
5. Paratransit costs per trip are high, driven by service operated by RTA

 2) RTA is facing major risks on its assets and funding, but
opportunities exist to redesign and rethink operations
1. RTA is facing major risks regarding its funding sources
2. Opportunities exist to redesign and rethink operations

6

3. Public perception of decision-making and goals and
demographic changes affect RTA’s prospects
4. Aging assets are a major concern, both for rail vehicles and for
rail infrastructure
5. Leveraging growth in central urban areas and potential transitoriented development should be additional priorities

 3) RTA’s current funding levels are not sufficient for significant
capital needs (vehicles and infrastructure)

7

 4) Reducing RTA’s administrative budget to peer average would
free up to $13 million for operations and maintenance

Source: NTD
Notes: All costs expressed in Year-of-Expenditure (YOE) dollars.

 4) Privatizing all paratransit service would free up to $7.9 million
for operations and maintenance

 4) Cost efficiencies and revenue increase strategies could yield
up to $21 million in savings and $8 million in revenues per year

10

Source: NTD
Notes: Ridership indexed to 2014 levels.

 4) RTA has had success in attracting (re)development through
station improvements and new investments

11

— HealthLine has contributed to attracting over $9 billion in
development to Euclid Corridor since 2008
— Reconstruction of Cedar-University station and relocation of
Mayfield - Little Italy Station has boosted ridership and
generated millions in redevelopment in nearby areas
— Cedar-University ridership up 26%
— Little Italy ridership up 250%

 4) A regional partnership is needed to develop a vision for
Cleveland as a transit-oriented region
— GCP and business community, major private employers
— Cities, Cuyahoga County
— Ohio Department of Development
— NOACA, ODOT
12

— Not-for-Profit sector (Fund for Our Economic Future, Cleveland
Foundation, Cleveland Neighborhood Progress)
— Institutions providing development finance (Port of Cleveland)

— Develop new incentives to encourage redevelopment and locating
jobs in Downtown Cleveland and around major transit services

 5) RTA has an advanced Performance tracking system, but lacks
in sharing it with its employees and the public
— Leading the way among peer agencies on KPIs

— Lack of public facing dashboards and frequent reporting
separates RTA from the “best in class” agencies
13

— Internal dashboards available to all staff can enhance
accountability
— Public dashboard and reporting can help with two key
goals:
— Customer Service
— Enhancing of RTA’s image

 6) Non-Federal Funding (State and Local): RTA, like other Ohio
agencies, mostly relies on local rather than state funding

the agencies. Source: National Transit Database

 6) Local Funding Focus: RTA relies on sales tax, like most peer
agencies
