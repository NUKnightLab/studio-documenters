AIR QUALITY FORECAST ACCURACY
(THROUGH AUGUST 31)
Air Quality Subcommittee
September 20, 2019

5-7

 ACTION REQUESTED

No action requested. This item is for presentation and
discussion.
• Air quality forecast accuracy (through August 31)

PREVIOUS ACTION

No Prior Action (Quarterly Update for Subcommittee)

5-7

 BACKGROUND
NOACA forecasts daily peak eight-hour ground-level
ozone concentrations and fine particulate matter
concentrations.

• In 2019, daily forecasts for ozone began March 1 and will
conclude October 31
• Daily forecasts for fine particulate matter are year-round

NOACA posts daily air quality forecasts through
AirNowTech, in affiliation with the United States
Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA)
5-7

 BACKGROUND
NOACA ground-level ozone and fine particulate matter
forecasts based on a review of several meteorological
variables and model guidance.

• National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
National Air Quality Forecast Capability (ozone only).
• Classification and Regression Tree (CART) Model
• Sonoma Tech Guidance (via Columbus/Central Ohio Forecast
on AirNow.gov)

 BACKGROUND
NOAA versus NOACA Forecast Performance (O3):
Exceedance Days
• “Missed Opportunities” – Three (3) days both NOAA and
NOACA did not forecast observed categorical Exceedance of
2015 8-hour ozone standard (70ppb); One (1) day NOACA
only missed; one (1) day NOAA only missed
• “False Alarms” – Four (4) days NOAA forecasted categorical
Exceedance of 2015 8-hour standard (70ppb) when observed
concentrations did not exceed (NOACA had two (2)).
5-7

 NEXT STEPS
• Track forecast performance of NOACA and NOAA for
ozone; NOACA only for fine particulate matter
• Collaborate with NOAA personnel to report model
performance in Northeast Ohio (October 9-10 Air Quality
Forecasters Workshop)
• Update Air Quality Subcommittee in December

5-7

 NOACA will STRENGTHEN regional
cohesion, PRESERVE existing
infrastructure, and BUILD a
sustainable multimodal transportation
system to SUPPORT economic
development and ENHANCE quality
of life in Northeast Ohio.
