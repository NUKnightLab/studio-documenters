ITEM #14 cont’d
Reason:

The amendment is required to procure the upgrade of a two-way radio system for the Internal
Disaster Response team. This upgrade must be performed by Johnson Controls, Inc. due to
an existing common piece of equipment shared by our physical plant and security/hospital
police department, which joins all of the hospitals radio frequencies together to utilize one
internal existing antenna infrastructure known as a combiner. The expiration date of the

Transmitting a Communication, dated December 3, 2007 from
ROBERT R. SIMON, M.D., Interim Chief, Bureau of Health Services
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to amend, increase by $3,329,710.00 and extend for
twenty-four (24) months, Contract No. 05-15-676H with The Burrows Company, Wheeling, Illinois, for
the purchase of infusion pump administration sets manufactured by B. Braun Medical, Inc. for the Bureau
of Health Services.
Board approved amount 01-01-05:
Increase requested:
Adjusted amount:
Reason:

$6,571,797.00
3,329,710.00
$9,901,507.00

Infusion pump models for two (2) of the major suppliers of infusion pumps and infusion
pump disposables (Baxter and Alaris) have several alerts and recalls respectively in past for
their products. As a result, an attempt by Cook County to solicit a bid for infusion pump
administration sets with new pumps in this reduced competitive environment would certainly
result in increased costs. The expiration date of the current contract is December 31, 2007.
The Cook County Bureau of Health Services estimates that the extension of this contract with
the existing infusion pumps provided by the vendor will result in cost savings of $914,486.00
(24%) to Cook County for this two-year extension.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $3,329,710.00 ($1,664,855.00 per year) [$19,272.00 ($9,636.00 per year) (240-362 Account); $707,932.00 ($353,966.00 per year) - (891-362 Account); $2,296,548.00

Company was the Surety for the contract providing performance Bond No. SB0087401. Before
completing the contract, UBM, Inc. defaulted and the County demanded performance from XL Specialty
Insurance Company under the Bond. A settlement was reached with this Surety Company to bring closure
to this project.
On July 31, the County Board approved a Settlement Agreement and Mutual Release. As part of the
Settlement Agreement, XL agreed to perform all of the remaining “disputed” work on the punch list, and
the County agreed not to seek liquidated damages. Of the $646,658.27 that remains in the Contract, the
parties agreed that the County was entitled to a credit of $320,000 for the work it performed. That left
$326,658.27 in the Contract, which, under the Settlement Agreement, would be deposited with the Clerk
of the Circuit Court, pursuant to a court order, one half of which would not be released to XL until Capital
Planning has approved the “disputed” work and the extended warranty (attached to the Settlement
Agreement) began to run.
Because of XL’s delays in performing the work agreed upon in the Settlement Agreement, Capital
Planning took it upon itself to accomplish some of the work and to acquire a warranty agreement that
included the work under the Contract. Therefore, the terms of the Settlement Agreement are no longer
viable.
In the copy of the Amended Settlement Agreement and Mutual Release (“Amended Settlement
Agreement”), XL has agreed to complete the remaining work on the Contract within the time-frame set
forth in the Amended Settlement Agreement. XL has also agreed that it is now entitled to only
$173,767.22 from the Contract funds (as opposed to $326,658.27 under the terms of the original
Settlement Agreement).
Fiscal Impact: None.
Approval of this settlement agreement is recommended by the State’s Attorney’s Office and the Office of
Capital Planning & Policy.

TIMOTHY C. EVANS, Chief Judge, Circuit Court of Cook County
requesting authorization to accept a grant award in the amount of $373,000.00 from the Redeploy Illinois
initiative of the Illinois Department of Human Services. Redeploy Illinois is a state-wide initiative that
targets high-risk juvenile offenders who face incarceration because they are no longer eligible for
detention alternative programs. The program helps divert this population by funding expansion of
community-based sanctions and treatment alternatives. In Cook County, the grant would fund the
diversion of 30 minors from detention to residential treatment programs which are under the supervision
of the Juvenile Probation and Court Services Department’s Intensive Probation Supervision (IPS) unit.
Funds would be used exclusively for treatment services.
