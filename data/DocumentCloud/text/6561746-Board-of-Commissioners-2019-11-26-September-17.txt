meeting earlier today. Commissioner Brewer chaired the meeting and the following committee

On behalf of the Real Estate Operations Development committee, Commissioner Brewer presented an
Omnibus Motion for approval of Items 4 through 11A.
(Item 4)
The resolution for Item 4 approves an Inter-Governmental Agreement with the Regional Housing
Initiative (RHI) and adopts the RHI Supplemental Administrative Plan. The Regional Housing Initiative
is a consortium of 10 Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) working to identify and create affordable
housing opportunities for low-income families. The Regional Housing Initiative was started in 2002 and
garnered the attention of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. RHI promotes
attractive mixed-income, well-managed housing developments that meet community and regional needs
with particular focus on locations near jobs and public transit. HUD awarded RHI a $1 million pilot
grant in 2012 to evaluate strategies for mobility moves and to develop a regional housing waiting list
from participating PHA wait lists. CHA agreed to pool a total of 350 of its vouchers with other
participating PHAs to support the creation of 778 units of newly created project-based units. CHA’s
participation in the Regional Housing Initiative supports HUD’s goal to expand housing options for lowincome families and increase the number of units available to families that choose to relocate to areas of
opportunity.
RESOLUTION NO. 2019-CHA-50
WHEREAS, The Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the Board
letter dated September 17, 2019 entitled “Recommendation to execute an InterGovernmental Agreement with the Regional Housing Initiative and adopt the

THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF THE
CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY:
THAT,

The Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to 1)
execute an Inter-Governmental Agreement with the Regional Housing Initiative; 2) adopt
the Supplemental Administrative Plan; and 3) execute all other documents as may be
necessary or appropriate to implement the foregoing.

 (Item 5)
The resolution for Item 5 approves a Housing Assistance Payments (HAP) Contract with Renaissance
Partners Apartments. Initial contract rents will be determined by market comparables and fair market
rents applicable at the time the HAP contract is executed. All rent determinations will comply with
federal regulations and CHA policy. Renaissance Partners Limited Partnership is a 101-unit SRO
property located in the Douglas community. The building has participated in CHA’s Moderate
Rehabilitation (Mod Rehab) portfolio since October 2000. Renaissance Partners has applied to the US
Department of Housing & Urban Development (HUD) to convert the existing Mod Rehab contract to
Project Based Vouchers (PBV) under the Rental Assistance Demonstration Program - Second
Component (RAD2). Subject to HUD and CHA approvals, 100 new RAD2 vouchers will be assigned
to CHA to administer. While Mod Rehab is a 1-year, renewable rental subsidy contract, RAD2
provides a 20-year rental subsidy contract to preserve affordable housing for special needs households.
Renaissance Partners will complete several repairs, including masonry, lintels, and a new roof. Tenants
will remain in the building during repairs. RAD2 will assist 100 studio units, each approximately 185220 square feet. All units include an individual bathroom, as well as a kitchen with refrigerator and
range. All utilities are provided by the building. Eight (8) studio units are accessible, and eleven (11)
units are adaptable.
RESOLUTION NO. 2019-CHA-51

The Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to

the foregoing.

(Item 6)
The resolution for Item 6 authorizes CHA staff to proceed with the application process for Renaissance
North Apartments under the HUD’s Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) program. The RAD
conversion of Renaissance North’s 18 Public Housing units to Project-Based Voucher (PBV) funding
will allow the property to operate under a more stable funding source and provide flexibility to the new
owner to leverage private financing for property improvements. Renaissance North is a mixed-finance
property in the Near North Side community area of Chicago in the Old Town neighborhood. The
property currently contains ground floor retail space with a total of 59 residential units, including 18
Public Housing units; 12 LIHTC units; and 29 market rate units. The property was previously owned by
North Larrabee Limited Partnership and was purchased by Avanath Capital in March 2019. Avanath is
planning to invest $1.1 million in capital improvements to the property. The scope of work includes but
is not limited to new kitchen and bathroom upgrades to units, new flooring, and new appliances; a more
modernized security system; façade repairs and cleanup, water heater replacement, and LED lighting
upgrades. Construction is scheduled to be complete before or near the end of the third quarter 2019. The
property improvements planned and underway are being financed through a conventional third-party
loan through Fannie Mae. The RAD conversion of the property’s Public Housing units will occur
without monetary contributions from the CHA.
RESOLUTION NO. 2019-CHA-52
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the Board
Letter dated September 17, 2019 requesting “Authorization to Proceed with the
Application Process for Renaissance North Apartments under the Rental Assistance
Demonstration Program”.
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF THE

such actions as may be necessary or appropriate to implement the foregoing.
(Item 7)
The resolution for Item 7 authorizes CHA staff to proceed with the application process for the Emmett
Street Project under HUD’s Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) program. The RAD application for
the Emmett Street Project will request that RAD Transfer of Assistance from Lathrop Homes be applied
to 50 Project-Based Voucher (PBV) units at the property. The RAD PBV assistance will allow for
flexibility to leverage financing for property development costs upfront and for future improvements as
needs arise. The Emmett Street Project will be a mixed-finance, mixed-use property in the Logan
Square community area of Chicago. The redevelopment site is a City-owned parking lot directly north of
the Logan Square Blue Line station (the project is formally known as the Logan Square TOD project).
The property is currently planned to contain 4,500 square feet of ground floor commercial space with a
total of 100 residential units, including 50 RAD PBV units and 50 LIHTC units. Bickerdike
Redevelopment Corporation will acquire the 41,200-square foot lot from the City of Chicago for $1;
Bickerdike will develop and own the project. Post completion, Emmett Street is currently planned to
contain 16 one-bedroom units; 25 two-bedroom units; and 9 three-bedroom units for CHA families. The
project development costs are currently projected to be $31 million. Low Income Housing Tax Credits
(LIHTC), Tax Increment Financing (TIF), and other layered financing resources are anticipated to be
assembled as the project’s sources of funds. A financing plan will be brought before the Board of
Commissioners at a later date, once plans are solidified.
RESOLUTION NO. 2019-CHA-53
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the Board
Letter dated September 17, 2019 requesting “Authorization to Proceed with the
Application Process for the Emmett Street Project utilizing Transfer of Assistance from
Julia Lathrop Homes under the Rental Assistance Demonstration Program”.
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF THE
CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY:
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to
proceed with the application process for the Emmett Street Project utilizing Transfer of
Assistance from Julia Lathrop Homes under the Rental Assistance Demonstration
program and execute and deliver such documents and perform such actions as may be

(Item 8)
The resolution for Item 8 approves extension of the Service Agreement between the CHA and The
Gordian Group for one year, through September 28, 2020, through CHA’s participation in the New
York City Housing Authority’s (NYCHA) contract with The Gordian Group, and further recommends
that the Board authorize additional compensation for The Gordian Group in an amount not-to-exceed
$2,060,000 for the extension term. When CHA initially contracted with The Gordian Group to
facilitate the Section 3 JOC program the goal was to execute $30,000,000 of construction task orders
over the 2 ½ year base contract period. The CHA obtained additional Board approval to amend the
Service Agreement with the Gordian Group to increase The Gordian Group’s compensation for the 2 ½
year base contract period, plus the option year available under the Contract, to the current contract value
of $10,240,000. The plan is to continue to support the program over the next year to meet the needs of
the CHA. The requested not-to-exceed compensation amount of $2,060,000 for the extension term is
intended to facilitate an additional projected job order value of up to $40,000,000 through September
2020.
Commissioner Parker recused from voting on Item No. 8.
RESOLUTION NO. 2019-CHA-54
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the Board
letter dated September 17, 2019 entitled: AUTHORIZATION TO EXTEND AND TO
PROVIDE ADDITIONAL COMPENSATION FOR THE SERVICE AGREEMENT
BETWEEN THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY (CHA) AND THE GORDIAN
GROUP TO MANAGE SECTION 3 JOB ORDER CONTRACTING (JOC)
MENTORING PROGRAM, THROUGH CHA’S PARTICIPATION IN THE NEW
YORK CITY HOUSING AUTHORITY’S AGREEMENT WITH THE GORDIAN
GROUP
5

 THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF THE
CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY:
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners (Board) of the Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) authorizes
the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to extend the Service Agreement between the
CHA and The Gordian Group to continue to manage and grow the Section 3 Job Order
Contracting (JOC) Mentoring Program for the one (1) year period from September 29,
2019 through September 28, 2020, through CHA’s participation in the New York City
Housing Authority’s agreement with The Gordian Group, and further authorizes
additional compensation for The Gordian Group in an amount not-to-exceed $2,060,000
for the extension term.
This contract amendment is subject to the Contractor’s compliance with the CHA’s
MBE/WBE/DBE/ Section 3 hiring and insurance requirements.

(Item 9)
The resolution for Item 9 ratifies the execution of a purchase and sale agreement and any amendments
thereto, for the sale of the property at 10527 South Corliss and authorizes the submission of a disposition
application to HUD for the sale of the property. The Property, acquired in 1983 by the CHA, is a twostory, two-unit row house located in the Pullman community area, and within the Pullman Historic
District. The Property has been vacant since November 2005. It is presently secured and considered
uninhabitable. In 2014, the property was listed in the MTW Annual Plan for disposition, and again in
the 2016 MTW Annual Plan as part of the second amendment to the plan. In December 2017, CHA staff
completed a physical needs assessment of the property and confirmed that a costly gut rehab would be
needed to fully rehabilitate the property. The property was appraised in March 2017 and is valued at
$13,000. Additionally, the CHA has submitted the Property for review by the Illinois Historic
Preservation Agency (IHPA), as part of the environmental review process. The Cook County Land
Bank Authority (CCLBA) is seeking to acquire the CHA-owned Corliss property on behalf of
Community Neighborhood Initiatives (CNI). CNI plans to renovate 10527 South Corliss as part of its
Pullman Revitalization Plan where they have already invested more than $5 million to renovate dozens
of historic rowhomes, all of which have been sold to new owner‐occupants. The CCLBA already owns
the vacant row house adjacent to the CHA-owned vacant property which CCLBA will also deed to CNI.
IHPA has recommended a preservation covenant be placed on the Property before it is conveyed to the
CCLBA to ensure its architectural integrity. The CHA has met all necessary regulatory requirements
under 24 CFR 970.9 (Resident Participation – Consultation and Opportunity to Purchase) through a
series of notices, meetings, and an offer of sale to the Central Advisory Council. The requested action
complies with all federal disposition regulations.
RESOLUTION NO. 2019-CHA-55
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the Board
Letter dated September 17, 2019 entitled “Authorization to Submit a Disposition
Application for Property in the Pullman Community Area.”
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF THE
CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY:
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners 1) Ratifies the execution of a purchase and sale agreement
and any amendments thereto, for the sale of the property at 10527 South Corliss; 2)
Authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to submit a disposition application
to the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for the sale
of the property; and 3) Authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to execute
and deliver such other documents and perform such actions as may be necessary or
appropriate to implement the foregoing.
This matter is not subject to compliance with CHA’s MBE/WBE/DBE/ Section 3
hiring and insurance requirements.

(Item 10)
The resolution for Item 10 authorizes the CEO to submit Disposition Application to HUD for disposition
of Cabrini property for the first phase of Parkside 4 Phase 2; and amends Board Resolution Number
2018-CHA-89 to reduce the approved CHA funding to not-to-exceed $13,000,000. In November 2018,
the CHA Board approved Resolution Number 2018-CHA-89 committing $22,500,000 ($18.3M for
6

 construction and $4.2M for remediation of the entire site), for the development of 134 rental units and
56 market rate for-sale townhomes. Unfortunately, the 2019 for-sale market has not been as robust as
anticipated. Holsten’s construction lender, CIBC, requires 20 pre-sales for construction to commence.
Since starting pre-sales in October of 2018, Holsten has managed to secure only nine contracts out of a
total of 56 for-sale units. Citing concerns the for-sale market is showing a poor performance in the area,
CIBC pulled out of the for-sale townhome development. Holsten decided to split the rental and for-sale
projects and move forward with closing and development of the rental phase at this time and reconsider
what makes the most sense for what was the for-sale site, at a near future date. The subject of this Board
action is a 102-unit mixed income rental phase consisting of 35 CHA, 31 affordable, and 36 market rate
units, in the Near North area. CHA shall enter into an unrestricted ground lease with the non-profit
sponsor, the Cabrini Green LAC Community Development Corporation. After execution of the ground
lease, the Sponsor shall assign the ground lease to the Rental Owner, subject to certain regulatory
restrictions. The ground lease shall cover Block 5 of the Rental Component.
RESOLUTION NO. 2019-CHA-56
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the Board
Letter dated September 17, 2019 entitled “Authorization to Submit Disposition
Application and Amend Board Resolution Number 2018-CHA-89 to Provide Chicago
Housing Authority Funds not to exceed $13,000,000 for the first phase of Development
of Parkside 4 Phase 2.”
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF THE
CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY:
THAT,

the Chief Executive Officer or his designee is authorized to submit a disposition
application to HUD for the disposition of Cabrini property for the first phase of
development of Parkside Phase 4 Phase 2;

THAT.

Board Resolution Number 2018-CHA-89 is hereby amended to reduce the approved
Chicago Housing Authority funds to an amount not to exceed $13,000,000; and

THAT,

the Chief Executive Officer, or his designee, is authorized to execute and deliver such
other documents and perform such actions as may be necessary or appropriate to
implement the foregoing.
This award is subject to the Contractor’s compliance with CHA’s MBE/WBE/DBE/
Section 3 hiring and insurance requirements.

(Item 11- Amended)
The resolution for Item 11 approves the assignment of the ground lease of the Archer Courts site to
RAHF IV Archer Courts, LLC and accept repayment of the seller’s note loan(s). The Property was
leased to Community Housing Partners V L.P. in 1999. The property contains a total of 146 units which
are subsidized under a long-term project-based rental assistance contract with HUD. Community
Housing Partners V L.P. has entered into an agreement to sell the property to RAHF IV Archer Courts,
LLC, which is controlled by Jonathon Rose Companies, an affordable developer based in New York
City, New York. The buyer intends to assume the contract, stabilize the property, substantially
rehabilitate the property and maintain affordability for at least another 20 years.
At the Finance & Audit Committee meeting, a commissioner requested that the resolution for Item No.
11 be amended subject to confirmation that the new entity does not have the ability to convert the
subsidized units into for-sale units.
RESOLUTION NO. 2019-CHA-57
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the Board
Letter dated September 17, 2019 entitled “Approval of the Assignment of the ground
lease of the Archer Courts site to RAHF IV Archer Courts, LLC.”
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF THE
CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY:
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to: 1)
Approve the assignment of the ground lease underlying the subject land; 2) Accept
7

 repayment of the seller’s note loan(s); and 3) Execute and deliver of such other
documents and perform such actions as may be necessary or appropriate to implement the
foregoing, subject to confirmation that the new entity does not have the ability to convert
the subsidized units into for-sale units..
(Item 11A)
The resolution for Item 11A authorizes the Chief Executive Officer to approve CHA Community
Support Corporation’s Ownership Interest in Southbridge Phase 1A and 1B. The Harold Ickes Homes
development (Ickes), originally situated on approximately 18 acres within the near south side
community area of the city of Chicago and was located between 22nd Street (North), State Street (East),
25th Street and 24th Street (South) and Dearborn and Federal Street (West), is currently being
redeveloped. The demolition of all buildings was completed in 2010 and the selected development
team for Ickes, approved by the BOC June 16, 2015, is The Community Builders, Inc. a Delaware
corporation and McCaffery Interests, Inc., an Illinois corporation. On September 18, 2018, the BOC
approved the funding, submission of a Project-Based Voucher (PBV) Rental Assistance Demonstration
(RAD) Financing Plan to the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development and
execution of a Housing Assistance Payment Contract for the closing and redevelopment of Ickes Phase
1A and 1B, to be known as Southbridge. On March 27, 2018, the BOC approved the formation of CHA
Community Support Corporation, an Illinois not-for-profit entity (CHA CSC) to allow its participation
and financing in mixed-finance projects. The Ickes development team needs an un-affiliated entity to
have a 21 percent (21%) ownership interest in the ownership of Phase 1A and 1B due to the
requirements of the low-income housing tax credit investor in the projects. CHA CSC is acceptable to
the investor. Therefore, CHA requests approval to allow CHA CSC to have an ownership interest in
Southbridge Phase 1A and 1B.
RESOLUTION NO. 2019-CHA-58
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the Board
Letter dated September 17, 2019 entitled “Authorization to Approve 1) CHA Community
