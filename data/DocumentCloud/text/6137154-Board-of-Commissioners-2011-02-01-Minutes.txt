Except as provided in Section 74-273, every user of tangible personal property which is
purchased at retail on or after December 1, 1995, from a retailer and which is titled or registered at a
location within the corporate limits of the County with an agency of the State government, shall be liable
for a tax on the privilege of using such property in the County at the rate of three-quarter percent of such
property's selling price (as the term "selling price" is defined by 35 ILCS 105/2 (use defined). The tax

person using such property within the County pursuant to Section 74-277. If any retailer, in collecting the
amount which purports to constitute use taxes measured by receipts from sales which are subject to tax
under this article, collects more from the purchaser than the actual use tax liability on the transaction, the
purchaser shall have a legal right to claim a refund of such amount from such retailer. However, if such
amount is not refunded to the purchaser for any reason, the retailer is liable to pay such amount to the
Department.
(b)
Every retailer maintaining a place of business in the County and making sales of tangible
personal property for use in the County shall, when collecting the tax as provided in Section 74-272 from
the purchaser, give to the purchaser a receipt for such tax in the manner and form prescribed by the
Department. Such receipt shall be sufficient to relieve the purchaser from further liability for the tax to
which such receipt may refer.

(d)
A purchaser or user who is liable to pay use tax directly to the Department only
occasionally and not on a frequent recurring basis, and who is not required to file returns with the
Department as a retailer under Section 74-275 concerning the filing of regular monthly tax returns and all
provisions concerning the requirements of registrants to post bond or other security with the Department
shall apply to such purchasers or users; except that such a purchaser or user shall not be entitled to the two

Transactions not subject to tax.

Notwithstanding any other provisions of this article, uses of tangible personal property, as defined
in Section 74-271, which are exempt under the applicable provisions of 55 ILCS 5/5-1008 (home rule
county use tax) and the Use Tax Act (35 ILCS 105/1 et seq.) shall not be subject to the tax imposed by
this article.
Sec. 74-274.

Retailer registration; security.

(a)
Every retailer maintaining a place of business in the County shall apply for registration as
a tax collector with the Department no later than 30 days after commencing such business or 30 days after
the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, whichever occurs later. Application
for registration shall be made to the Department by use of the form furnished by the Department for such
purpose and shall contain such information as the Department may reasonably require.
(b)
The Department may require an applicant for registration to furnish, within 30 days after
commencing to engage in the business of selling tangible personal property at retail, a bond from a surety
company authorized to do business in the State, or a bond secured by an assignment of a bank account or
certificate of deposit, conditioned upon the applicant paying to the County all moneys becoming due
under this article. The Department shall fix the amount of any such security in each case, taking into
consideration the amount of money expected to become due from the applicant under this article. The
amount of any security required by the Department shall be as such as, in the Department's opinion, will
protect the County against failure to pay the amount which may become due from the applicant under this
article. The amount of any security required by the Department shall not exceed three times the amount of
the applicant's average monthly tax collection and remittance liability or $50,000.00, whichever amount is
lower. A retailer that fails to furnish security required by the Department in accordance with this section
shall not be permitted to register as a tax collector.
(c)
A tax collector which has, as verified by the Department, faithfully and continuously
complied with the conditions of its bond or other security under the provisions of this article for a period
of three consecutive years, shall be entitled to a release of the bond or other security and shall be exempt
from all requirements of furnishing a bond or other security as a condition precedent to registration under
this article. Such exemption shall continue until such time as the Department shall determine that the tax
collector is delinquent in the filing of any return or is delinquent or deficient in the paying of any tax
under this article.
(d)
With respect to security other than bonds (upon which the Department may sue in the
event of a forfeiture), if a tax collector fails to pay, when due, any amount whose payment such security
guarantees, the Department shall, after such liability is admitted by the tax collector or established by the
Department through issuance of a final assessment that has become final under the law, convert or cause
to be converted the security which the tax collector has furnished, into money for the County after first
giving the tax collector ten-days' written notice by registered or certified mail, to pay the liability or
forfeit such security to the Department. If the security consists of a bank certificate of deposit, the
Department shall convert the security into money by demanding and collecting the amount of such bank
certificate of deposit from the bank which issued the certificate. If the Department realizes more than the
amount of such liability from the security, plus the expenses incurred by the Department in converting the
security into money, the Department shall pay such excess to the tax collector who furnished such
security, and the balances thereby received on behalf of the County shall be paid into the corporate fund
of the County.

LAW LIBRARY FILING FEE
WHEREAS, 55 ILCS 5/5-39001 authorizes the clerk of all civil trial courts at the county seat of
government to collect a filing fee to defray the cost of operating and maintaining a county law library; and

77

 TABLE OF CONTENTS FOR FEBRUARY 1, 2011
WHEREAS, P.A. 96-0227, effective August 11, 2009, authorizes counties in Illinois to increase the
County Law Library Filing Fee to defray the cost of operating and maintaining law libraries to a
maximum of $21 in 2011; and
WHEREAS, P.A. 96-0227 was supported by many other counties around the state including: DeKalb,
DuPage, Kane, Kendall, Lake, Madison, McHenry, McLean, St. Clair, Tazewell, Will and Winnebago
Counties; and
WHEREAS, prior to P.A. 96-0227, the General Assembly only increased the maximum filing fee by
three dollars, during the previous 20 years, which is less than half of the CPI increase during that same
time-period; and
WHEREAS, the current $18 dollars is inadequate in defraying the expenses the Cook County Law
Library; and
WHEREAS, unlike many businesses, the Library’s revenues and expenses fluctuate independent of the
Library’s influences, cases filed in the courts, patron traffic, inflationary increases on books and online
legal publications all influence the revenues and expenses of the Library; and
WHEREAS, a misperception exists that all relevant legal information is freely available online to the
average citizen, when, the average citizen does not have subscriptions to online legal publications; and
WHEREAS, county law libraries provide the general public with access to justice, which includes both
pint and electronic legal information and research assistance that they would not be able to access
anywhere else; and
WHEREAS, Cook County’s Law Library is a National Hub Law Library which provides citizens with
access to over a quarter of a million print titles and several online legal databases and with seven branch
libraries, it is the only law library in the area that is freely available to all people without restriction; and
WHEREAS, Other counties law library filing fees are much higher than Cook’s, for example: Los
Angeles’ filing fee, a similarly sized county, is $24, Sacramento, CA ($50), San Francisco, CA ($42), San
Diego, CA ($38), Alameda, CA ($37), El Paso, TX ($35) King, WA ($20) and Wayne, MI ($20); and
WHEREAS, it is critical that the Library maintain a collection and professional staff which can meet the
needs of the Law Library’s patrons including attorneys, state and federal judges, law clerks, law
librarians, self-represented litigants, administrative law judges, public librarians, paralegal students and
the general public seeking legal information.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that Chapter

85

 TABLE OF CONTENTS FOR FEBRUARY 1, 2011
(4)

Permit to cremate a dead human body obtained from the Office of the Medical Examiner,
by facsimile or electronic filing.

(5)

Return fee. The Return Fee is charged to funeral homes that pick up bodies from the
Medical Examiner's Office and then request to return them to the Office after determining
that the family has no funds for burial. This cost would include the cost of the burial
shell and the burial cost.

(6)

Death certificate amendment fee. Fee is charged if the amendment is made later than 1
year of the person's death (due to a return by Funeral Home). The Office of the Medical

to a death certificate after 1 year of the death.

(7)

Storage fee. This fee covers the bodies returned (by the Funeral Homes) to the Office of
the Medical Examiner for storage while families secure funds for burial services. This
"storage fee" would replace the "return fee" if a funeral home returns a body and picks it
up again within 10 days. If the body is not picked up within 10 days, the body will be
held and buried by the County according to the standard operating procedures of the
Medical Examiner. This "storage fee" discourages the use of the Office of the Medical
Examiner as a storage location by funeral homes and also encourages the funeral
directors to verify that families have funds for burial prior to removing a body from the
Office of the Medical Examiner.

(8)

Photographs, radiographs, and histology slides.

$1,000 and imprisoned not more than six months.
Sec. 38-139.

Annual report.

The Medical Examiner shall prepare and submit to the Cook County Board of Commissioners an
annual report of the activities of his/her office.
Sec. 38-140.

Medical Examiner Fees Fund.

Beginning on or before March 1, 2011, the Comptroller shall create a special revenue fund to be
entitled the, “Medical Examiner Fees Fund.” The revenue collected by the Office of the Medical
Examiner from all of the various fees of the Office of the Medical Examiner shall be placed in such
86

 TABLE OF CONTENTS FOR FEBRUARY 1, 2011
special fund for the Office of the Medical Examiner to be held by the Treasurer of the County. Such
revenues collected and placed in such special fund shall only be disbursed by appropriation of the County
Board and shall be used solely for the purchase of electronic and forensic identification equipment or
other related supplies and the operating expenses of the Medical Examiner’s Office.

covenants of the County relating to the Tax Exempt status of interest on the Note if it is issued as Tax
Exempt.

proceeds of the Note which would result in making the interest payable on the Note subject to federal
income taxes by reason of the Note being classified as an “arbitrage bond” within the meaning of Section
148 of the Code or rulings or regulations promulgated thereunder.
The County also agrees and covenants with the purchaser and registered owner of the Note from
time to time outstanding that, to the extent possible under Illinois law, it will comply with whatever
federal tax law is adopted in the future which applies to the Note and affects the status of the interest on
the Note as Tax Exempt, if the Note is issued as Tax Exempt; that without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the County agrees: (a) through its officers, to make such further specific covenants,
representations and assurances as may be necessary or advisable; (b) to comply with all representations,
covenants and assurances contained in a certification regarding tax exemption to be prepared by counsel
approving the Note; (c) to consult with such counsel and to comply with such advice as may be given; (d)
to pay to the United States, as necessary, such sums of money representing required rebates of excess
arbitrage profits relating to the Note; (e) to file such forms, statements and supporting documents as may
be required and in a timely manner; and (f) if deemed necessary or advisable by its officers, to employ
and pay fiscal agents, financial advisors, attorneys and other persons to assist the County in such
compliance; and that the County acknowledges that, in the event of an examination by the Internal
Revenue Service of the exemption from Federal income taxation for interest paid on the Note, under
present rules, the County is treated as the “taxpayer” in such examination.
Section 2.8.
Registered Form: The County agrees that it will not take any action to permit the Note,
if it is issued as Tax Exempt, to be issued in, or converted into, bearer or coupon form.

WHEREAS, utility audit programs can be designed to save money or increase revenue,
while providing the same or better level of service to the County; and

preference in pricing for local vendors; and
WHEREAS, AmAudit provides services which include a forensic audit of electricity, natural
gas and telecommunications costs, utility costs and franchise compensation and is undertaken

 TABLE OF CONTENTS FOR FEBRUARY 1, 2011

Chairman Gorman heard testimony regarding opportunities to increase energy efficiency and green
technology in a collective and cooperative manner.
Chairman Gorman called the meeting to order an introduced Gregg Carr, president and founder of
AmAudit, and Ty R. Miller, Schneider Electric Project Coordinator, Energy Solutions Building Business,
for a presentation.
Mr. Carr stated that President Preckwinkle has proposed 29 initiatives to achieve four goals (1) fiscal
responsibility, (2) short-term reduction in spending by 21% across the board, (3) improvement of services
for citizens of Cook County, and (4) transparency and accountability. Mr. Carr stated that it can provide
the County with expertise in the areas of utility and revenue auditing. (See attached.)
Mr. Miller stated that carbon emissions are increasing and affecting the environment. He further stated
that by the year 2050 the world will need energy twice as much. The carbon emissions need to be cut by
fifty percent and the carbon emissions need not degrade the environment anymore. He further stated that
Schneider Electric employs one-hundred-and fifteen thousand individuals and is a world-wide company.
(See attached.)
Kevin Givens, Director, Environmental Control, Bureau of Administration, informed the Committee that
activities have been underway by the Bureau of Administration, Department of Environmental Control
and Capital Planning for a number of years. The Departments are currently in the process of working with
the campuses of the Department of Corrections, the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center and the Stroger
campus.
Mr. Givens further stated that, currently, a company similar to Schneider Electric would be facilitating
capital equipment retrofits, in addition to capturing substantial savings that will actually pay for the
capital equipment upgrades and the contracts that are to be completed in February 2011. There are four
(4) million square feet of properties that will be upgraded using guaranteed performance contracting at no
obvious cost to the County. It would need to be financed, but the financing would be paid off through the
savings.
Commissioner Murphy moved to adjourn the meeting, seconded by Commissioner Schneider. The
motion carried and the meeting was adjourned.

CLERK OF THE CIRCUIT COURT
PROPOSED GRANT AWARD
Transmitting a Communication, dated January 6, 2011 from
DOROTHY A. BROWN, Clerk of the Circuit Court
164

 TABLE OF CONTENTS FOR FEBRUARY 1, 2011
requesting authorization to accept a grant award in the amount of $129,600.00 from the Illinois Criminal
Justice Information Authority (ICJIA). The funds will be used to improve disposition reporting to Illinois
State Police. This grant requires a cash match or an in-kind match of a minimum of 20 percent to provide
for the additional funds for providing an overall method or system of correcting the rejected postings from
the Illinois State Police's Criminal History Record Information (CHRI) system.
As the Clerk of the Circuit Court (CCC) lacks an overall method or system of correcting the rejected
postings from the Illinois State Police’s CHRI system, CCC is proposing to build an application that will
process the rejected dispositions that did not post to CHRI, provide a user interface to allow for updates to
the information contained in the Clerk’s disposition reporting, and to transmit that information so that it
successfully posts to CHRI. This solution will specifically provide for:
Automating the interface of records that are pushed back to CCC for correction and resubmission
to ISP’s system for updating to CHRI; and
Implementing improved data capture procedures (technical and operational) that would facilitate
complete arrest reporting, research missing dispositions and information for reporting to ISP’s
system; and
Reengineering business processes that are impacted by the new application build; and
Examining and improving data collection at critical points throughout the justice process; and
Establishing more effective accuracy and information quality and auditable controls; and
Reducing the backlog of missing disposition or related information.
Additionally, the solution will have to examine the collection points of information coming into the
Circuit Court. There may be opportunities for improvements in receiving critical data through an
electronic exchange as opposed to many of manual entry points that exist today. Lastly, CCC will also
add stakeholders to the project as necessary, especially as it relates to agencies that are identified through
the data collection and exchange points, where improvements can be made in ensuring accurate and
complete information at its point of origin. Justice XML standards will be used as appropriate.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: $32,400.00. (528-818 Account). Grant Award: $129,600.00. Funding period:
January 1, 2011 through March 31, 2012.
Sufficient funds are available in the Circuit Court Automation Fund.
The Budget Department has received all requisite documents and determined the fiscal impact on Cook
County, if any.
