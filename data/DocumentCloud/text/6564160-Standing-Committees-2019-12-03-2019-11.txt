communications. Satisfaction ratings were high – Light Rail: 90%; Cleveland State Line: 97%

The Proposed FY 2020 Budget supports the daily operating activities of the Authority and continues the
plan towards achieving a state of good repair. The following pages discuss the assumptions used in
developing the Proposed FY 2020 Budget.
The 2019 General Fund Amended Budget projected Sales & Use Tax receipts at $211.2 million, a 3.3
percent increase from 2018 actual receipts. Through October 2019, total receipts were $175.4 million, a
3.7 percent increase from 2018 levels and a 1.3 percent increase from the 2019 amended budget. By yearend, receipts are estimated to be $211.2 million, $3.8 million better than budget.
The 2019 Third Quarter estimate maintains reimbursed expenditures at $22.1 million, which includes
preventive maintenance reimbursements of $20 million, of which $6 million is from OTP2 funding from the
State. Passenger Fares are estimated at $43.2 million, a 7.4 percent decrease from 2018 receipts. Total
revenue for 2019 is estimated at $283.1 million. With the beginning balance of $39.0 million, total resources
for 2019 are estimated at $322.1 million, an increase of $2.3 million from the 2019 Amended Budget.
Total Operating Expenditures for 2019 are estimated at $243.9 million. During 2019, the Fraternal Order of
Police (FOP) and Non-Bargaining employees received a 3 percent wage increase. The Amalgamated
Transit Union (ATU) contract ended in 2017 and contract negotiations are continuing. Total operating
expenses are projected to end the year at $243.9 million. A $6 million transfer was made at the beginning
of the year to the Reserve Fund for Rail Car replacement. An additional $5 million is planned to be
transferred in December 2019, bringing total transfers to other funds is at $41.1 million. With Total
Resources projected at $322.1 million and Total Expenditures estimated at $285.0 million, the ending
balance for 2019 is projected at $37.1 million, a 1.8-month available balance.
The Board of Trustees’ first review of the proposed 2020 – 2024 Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) took place
on May 14, 2019 and the 2020 Capital Budget Appropriations on was approved and adopted on May 14,
2019. The Proposed 2020 Operating Budget and Amended 2019 General Fund budget will be presented to
the Board on November 12, 2019. Public Hearings will be held on November 12, 2019 and on December
3, 2019. On December 3, 2019, the Operational Planning & Infrastructure Committee is expected to make
a recommendation to the full Board of Trustees to adopt the Proposed 2020 General Fund and other funds
budgets and the Amended 2019 General Fund Budget. Adoption will be considered at the December 17,
2019 Board Meeting.
The Authority engaged in five Pillar Studies, of which three have been completed and two will be completed
by year-end 2019. These Pillar Studies include Rail Car Study, Economic Impact Study, Administrative
Study and Financial Review, Fare Equity Study, and System Redesign Study. These five Pillar Studies will
form the basis for the Authority’s next 10-year strategic plan. Recommendations from the three completed
studies are below.

                  Transmittal Letter & Citizens’ Summary                                                                        2 

 The Rail Car Study was conducted by LTK Engineering Services. This was a comprehensive evaluation of
the Authority’s Heavy Rail Vehicles (HRV) and Light Rail Vehicles (LRV). Based on the results of the study,
the HRVs have an estimated 5 years of remaining life. The cost for replacement of the HRV fleet is estimated
at $102 million for 34 cars (about $3 million per vehicle). The LRVs have an estimated remaining life of 10
years. The estimated replacement cost for the LRV fleet is $96 million (about $4 million per vehicle). An
additional $42 million will be needed to improve the rail facilities and infrastructure for the new vehicles. By
the end of the FY 2019, the Authority will have nearly $29 million of local funding in the Reserve Fund,
Rolling Stock Replacement for the local match of the rail vehicles.
The Economic Impact Study was conducted by Cleveland State University’s Center for Economic
Development. The results of this study were presented to the Board of Trustees in the 1st Quarter 2019 and
included the following:









Transit impact on Cuyahoga County property values: $2.2 billion
Property values increased 3.5% within a decade for previously unserved census tracts
RTA’s annual economic impact to Cuyahoga County: $322 million
RTA’s annual direct spending in Cuyahoga County: $182 million
RTA creates and sustains nearly 3,000 jobs in Cuyahoga County
RTA employees residing in Cuyahoga County: 1,800
Jobs created from RTA-purchased goods and services in Cuyahoga County: 1,177
Improved transit access in urban neighborhoods results in:
o 12.9% reduction in poverty
o 3.1% growth in employment

The Greater Cleveland Partnership (GCP) in collaboration with WSP completed the Administrative Study
and Financial Review. The results of this study were presented to the Board of Trustees in October 2019.
A summary of the conclusions and recommendations are below:
 Ridership declined 31% between 2007 and 2017 due to:
o Cuyahoga County population loss and emigration
o Changing development and employment patterns
o Increased competition in urban transportation market (Uber and Lyft)
o Dispersion of jobs in Cuyahoga County to the outlying areas creating difficulty in transit
providing accessible transportation
 Benchmarking is on par with peers except for administrative and paratransit costs
 Rail service is high compared to ridership
 Future of rail service in Cuyahoga County is tied to regional planning and economic development
 Operational budget is balanced based on the Authority’s assumptions
 Significant funding gaps exist for rail car replacement and rail infrastructure
 Cost efficiencies and revenue opportunities were identified through system redesigns
 Strong Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) exist but need to be shared with the public

 GENERAL FUND
ASSUMPTIONS
Inflation
Assumption:
Rationale:

1.8% to 2.1%

The Federal Reserve recently released their projections for the remainder of 2019 through the next 30 years.
The Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland noted that the 4th District economic activity has been stable and
expects inflation to be between 1.8 percent and 2.1 percent. The Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland
projects the inflation rate to remain under 2.1 percent over the next 10 years.
Interest Rates
Assumption:
Rationale:

1.75% to 2.5%

The Federal Reserve Bank cut the interest rate a quarter of a percent point in September 2019, the second
such cut in interest rates in 2019. The Federal Reserve further reduced interest rates by another quarter
point in October. The Authority has received an average of 2.26 percent interest income on its General
Fund investments and an average of 2.32 percent average yield on all investments in all Funds in 2019. For
the 2020 budget, a 2.0 percent rate was used to determine the amount of investment earnings.

REVENUES
The 2020 budget estimates $283.6
million in General Fund revenue and
FY 2020 GENERAL FUND

The specific assumptions and calculations for the revenues included there are as follows:
PASSENGER FARES

$41.4 MILLION

RATIONALE:
Passenger Fares are estimated at $41.4 million for 2020 representing a 4.0 percent decrease from 2019
levels based on the ridership estimates for 2020. As fuel prices remain low, choice riders continue to opt
driving rather than taking public transit. Additionally, ridership on the Red Line declined during the summer
due to track work on the west side. The 2020 Budget does not include any fare increase or service change.
The fare increase scheduled for August 2019 was postponed until August 2020, so the base fare is expected
to remain at $2.50.

collected taxes on Internet access before October 1, 1998, to continue implementing those taxes. Originally
one of 13 states identified in the Grandfather Clause, Ohio is now only one of 7 states that is held under the
Grandfather clause. The Internet Tax Freedom Act has been extended 8 times. With the passage of the
Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015, the restriction on taxing Internet access was
extended permanently, while the Grandfather Clause was extended temporarily until June 30, 2020. The
Authority is estimating a $3 to $5 million hit if this clause expires.

RATIONALE:
The Advertising and Concessions Category consists of two subcategories. The first is the current
advertising contract. For 2020, the revenue from the advertising contract is budgeted at $1.4 million. This
includes a contract for advertising on the bus shelters. The second category is the naming rights revenue
for the HealthLine, Cleveland State Line, and Metro Health Line and concessions that will net the Authority
about $1 million.
INVESTMENT INCOME

$780 THOUSAND

RATIONALE:
For 2020, the Investment Income is estimated at $780 thousand. The average yield on the Authority’s
investments is 2.3 percent in 2019.

                  Transmittal Letter & Citizens’ Summary                                                                        6 

 OTHER REVENUE

$2.1 MILLION

RATIONALE:
Other receipts include contractor and hospitalization claim reimbursements, rent, salvage sales, and
identification card proceeds, among other miscellaneous receipts. The amounts received from these
sources have fluctuated over the years, mainly due to one-time settlements and reimbursements. For 2020,
the other revenue category is budgeted at $2.1 million.

FUEL TAX REIMBURSEMENT
REIMBURSED LABOR & MATERIAL
TOTAL

$21.5 MILLION
$20.0M
$ 0.7M
$ 0.8M
$21.5M

RATIONALE:
Reimbursed Expenditures category includes reimbursements for Preventive Maintenance (PM), fuel tax,
labor and material, as well as other Federal and State reimbursements. For 2020, Reimbursed Expenditures
are budgeted at $21.5 million. This includes Preventive Maintenance at $20.0 million, $0.7 million for fuel
tax reimbursements, and $0.8 million for force account labor and other reimbursements. Increasing the PM
Reimbursement would reduce available funding for capital projects and negatively impact the ability to
achieve and maintain a state of good repair. An $11.76 million OTP2 grant was awarded by Ohio, of which
$6 million will be used for Reimbursed Expenditures. This will free up formula funding to be used for the
Light Rail Track rehabilitation.

EXPENDITURES
Operating Expenditures for the 2020
Operating
Budget
include
the
appropriation and expenditure changes
as described below. As with revenues,
expenditures are estimated not only for
the 2020 Budget Year, but also for the two
consecutive out-years to assist with
longer term planning. The General Fund
Balance Analysis projections include
those out-years to demonstrate the
impact of various items contained in the
2020 Budget (collective bargaining
agreements, service changes, contract
changes, as well as requirements of the
Capital Improvement Plan, etc.). Figure 7
Figure 6 
summarizes the budgeted expenditures
for 2020 and highlights the various areas of cost increases included in the proposed Operating Budget.
SALARIES & OVERTIME

$143.7 MILLION

RATIONALE:
Total salaries, wages and overtime for the 2020 Operating Budget are $143.7 million and represent 54.8
percent of the total 2020 General Fund expenses. The 2020 Operating Budget includes 2,333 FTE (full
time equivalent) positions. A 2.5 percent salary increase is budgeted for all positions. Both union contracts
ended in 2017. The FOP signed a new agreement in 2019, which again aligns wage increases to the

                  Transmittal Letter & Citizens’ Summary                                                                        7 

 revenue increases for passenger fares and sales tax from the prior year. The ATU negotiations are
continuing.
PAYROLL TAXES & FRINGE BENEFITS

HEALTH CARE / PRESCRIPTION
VISION / DENTAL / OTHER FRINGE BENEFITS
TOTAL

$53.4 MILLION
$21.2M
$28.1M
$ 4.1M
$53.4M

RATIONALE:
Payroll taxes and Ohio PERS (Ohio Public Employee Retirement System) budget for 2020 is $21.2 million.
Ohio PERS provides retirement, disability, and survivor benefit programs for public employees. Health Care
and prescription costs for 2020 are budgeted at $28.1 million and are projected to remain near 2019 levels.
The employee contribution for health care coverage is 14 percent. Employees can receive a one-percent
refund if they complete a physical and an additional one percent refund if they complete a dental exam.
Those employees who complete both received a 2 percent refund on their health care contribution. The
2020 budget for vision, dental, and other fringe benefits is $4.1 million. In each of the contracts, co-pays
and deductibles are identified by type of plan and family size. This action makes employees more involved
in their own care.
FUEL EXPENSES

$9.0 MILLION

RATIONALE:
The Energy Price Risk Management Program (aka Fuel Hedging Program) has helped to stabilize diesel
fuel and Compressed Natural Gas (CNG), two of the Authority’s most volatile expenses. Through this
program, the cost of fuel (diesel and CNG) has remained steady. The U.S. has increased production of
crude oil in the last few years and is now less dependent upon foreign sources. Between 2015 and 2019,
RTA placed 133 Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) buses into operation and retired older diesel buses,
reducing fuel by nearly a million dollars between 2017 and 2018. By 2020, 27 new CNG buses are planned
to be placed into operation. Total fuel costs for 2020 are budgeted at 9.0 million and include diesel, CNG,
propulsion power electricity for the trains, gasoline, and propane.

RATIONALE:
Maintenance contracts and other services are budgeted at $15.8 million. This category includes advertising
fees, multi-year maintenance contracts, and other miscellaneous services. The in-house service for NAPA
inventory for Paratransit expired in 2019 and Paratransit inventory was added to the inventory costs. Some
of the multi-year maintenance contracts are requirement-based and only invoiced when services are
needed. This helps to keep costs down throughout the year. The inventory category is budgeted at $13.7
million and includes all parts and equipment for the buses, trains, and facilities. This category also includes
the predictive maintenance kits for the fixed-route buses in the program. The collaborative work between
Asset Configuration & Management and Inventory for the predictive maintenance program has helped to
stabilize inventory expenses, increase miles between service interruptions, and keeping buses on the road.
Purchased transportation for ADA Paratransit services is budgeted at $ 10.3 million. Three new contracts
were started in June 2019. DriverMate was installed for the in-house and purchased transportation vehicles,
enabling better mapping and communication for pick-ups and drop-offs. This category also includes

                  Transmittal Letter & Citizens’ Summary                                                                        8 

 $650,000 of pass-through expenses for Medina County. The Authority trades operating dollars in exchange
for federal funding received by Medina County for their transit agency.
Other expenses includes liability claims and insurance premiums, which are budgeted at $4.4 million for
2020. Training, travel, and professional expenses are also in this category, budgeted at $2.2 million. This
includes tuition reimbursements, property taxes, leases and rentals, and other miscellaneous expenses.
Travel costs for the Bus and Rail Rodeos are also included.

TRANSFER TO THE INSURANCE FUND
The Insurance Fund has a required minimum fund balance of $5.0 to protect the Authority against
catastrophic or extraordinary losses. The Authority is self-insured in all areas except personal property and
equipment. Expenditures in the Insurance Fund are used for extraordinary claims and insurance premiums
over $150,000. With the increase in safety measures, claims have declined significantly, and the budgeted
transfers have generally been reduced. In 2019, a transfer of $2.7 million was budgeted to cover insurance
premiums and projected claim payments and to maintain the necessary ending balance. For 2020, a
transfer of $2.0 million is needed to cover estimated costs and maintain the fund at the required level.
Continued safety actions may allow the amounts in the out-years to be lowered.

TRANSFER TO THE SUPPLEMENTAL PENSION FUND
The Supplemental Pension Fund was established for payments of benefits relating primarily to certain
retired employees of the Authority and predecessor transit systems. Since 1986, the Pension Fund has
also been used to account for funds on deposit with the Ohio Public Employees Deferred Compensation
Board. The Authority has no control over these funds but is required to account for them in a trust. The
2020 budget estimates that the Supplemental Pension Fund will need transfers of $50,000. For the outyears, 2021 and 2022, additional transfers are planned in order to maintain the necessary balance within
this fund as identified in a bi-annual actuarial study.

TRANSFERS TO CAPITAL
This measure has fluctuated over the years. Between 2016 and 2018, General Fund Transfer to Capital
was $31.4 million, $27.3 million, and $32.6 million, respectively. In 2018, an additional transfer of $5.0
million was needed for the Radio CAD/AVL project, which increased the sales tax contribution to capital to
16.2 percent. Funding for this project came from a grant from the Federal Highway Administration under a
50/50 cooperative grant agreement that will reimburse RTA 50 percent of the funding used for the project.
The transfer to capital for 2019 was $25.3 million, $1.7 million less than budget as proceeds from the Bond
Issuance in 2019 was used to pay for the principal and interest payments for 2019 bonds. The 2020 Budget
calls for a transfer of $27.1 million to Capital. Local funds are transferred to the capital program to provide
the local match for preventive maintenance expenditures and for other locally funded state of good repair
projects that are ineligible to fund with debt service. For 2021 and 2022, the transfers to capital are planned
at $21.7 million and $22.3 million, respectively.

 EMPLOYMENT LEVEL ANALYSIS
The 2020 Budget reflects 2,333 FTEs. The pie chart to
the right represents the relative employment levels
within each division. During 2019, the Office of
Management & Budget was moved out of the Executive
Division and into the Finance & Administration Division.
For the 2020 Budget, the Rail Power & Way section was
moved out of Rail and as a stand-alone Department
under the Operations Division.

SERVICE LEVELS
For 2020, no significant service changes are planned. The Authority plans to maintain current services while
working with a consultant on a system redesign study, which is expected to be completed by December
2019. Any service changes recommended by this study will first be discussed with the public and further
refined before any implementation occurs. The Budgets service level comparison by mode is below.

 POLICY COMPLIANCE
The discussion in this section focuses on the Authority’s adopted financial policy objectives. These
objectives represent trends or indicators that are analyzed as they relate to long-range financial implications
for the organization. These financial policy objectives were amended in August 2011 and again in March
2017. The financial policies or trends, as outlined in Attachment B, are applied to the following areas:

OPERATING EFFICIENCY
An OPERATING RATIO of at least 25 percent is the policy goal. At 17.1 percent, this ratio will not meet
the objective for 2020, reflecting ridership declines over the past several years. RTA will need to increase
operating revenues and/or control expenses throughout the year in order to end the year with a ratio above
20 percent.
The COST PER HOUR OF SERVICE is to be maintained at or below the level of inflation (under 2
percent for 2020). For 2020, budgeted operating costs are increasing by 7.5 percent, compared to the 2019
estimate. Total Service hours are budgeted to be maintained in 2020. The cost per hour of service for 2020
is budgeted at $143.1, an 8.6 percent increase over 2019 estimates. This objective will not be met.
The ONE-MONTH OPERATING RESERVE requires that the Authority should have a year-end balance
equal to one month’s operating costs. The Operating Reserve objective is projected to be met again in 2019
at 1.8-months. For 2020, a one-month operating reserve is equal to $21.8 million. With a budgeted ending
balance of $25.0 million, a 1.1-month reserve, this measure will again be met.

CAPITAL EFFICIENCY
The goal for the DEBT SERVICE COVERAGE ratio is to be at or above 1.5. A debt issuance was
budgeted for 2017 but deferred to 2018 and again to 2019, based on capital needs and market conditions.
Debt service coverage for 2019 is estimated at 4.21. For 2020, the Debt Service Coverage is budgeted at
2.65. This objective will be met.
Another financial goal is to contribute a minimum of 10 percent of Sales Tax revenue to capital. This
indicator includes both the direct contributions to capital and the amount “set-aside” in the General Fund for
debt service. The CONTRIBUTION TO CAPITAL is projected to be above the minimum of 10 percent
in 2019, at 12.0 percent. The $30 million debt issuance in 2019 brought the Sales Tax contribution down.
The financial contributions to the capital programs support 100 percent of locally funded capital projects,
provide the local match for projects funded by grants, and funds the Authority’s debt service requirements.
For 2020, the Sales Tax Contribution to Capital is budgeted at 12.6 percent.
The CAPITAL MAINTENANCE OUTLAY TO CAPITAL EXPANSION remains above the Board Policy
goal of between 75 percent and 90 percent due to a large number of State of Good Repair (SOGR) capital
maintenance projects including the bus improvement program, reconstruction of heavy and light rail stations,
and track infrastructure projects. It will remain above the 90 percent maximum for 2020 and the out years
as the focus of the Authority’s capital program remains on the maintenance, rehabilitation, and the
replacement and/or upgrade of existing capital assets, rather than on expansion projects.
The Authority has been able to improve internal processes over the past years and reduce costs to enable
shifts of financial resources to address many SOGR capital projects. The Authority must continue to
maintain a balance between operating and capital funds to stay successful and develop plans to address
the significant challenges it will fact in the upcoming years.

 END OF YEAR RESERVE FUNDS
A $6 million transfer to the Rolling Stock Reserve Fund was made in the 1st Quarter of 2019 with an
additional transfer of $5 million planned to be made in the 4th Quarter of 2019. In 2020, a transfer of $5
million is budgeted for rail car replacement into the Rolling Stock Reserve Fund.
A transfer from the General Fund for the 27th pay is budgeted at $0.88 million. Every 12 years a 27th pay is
expected due to the pay cycles. To help cover these costs, a transfer of $1.5 million is budgeted in 2020
for salary employees, or 1/12 of annual pay costs.

CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PLAN
The Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) for 2020-2024 was approved by the Board May 14, 2019. The CIP
provides for the purchase, maintenance, and improvement of the Authority’s capital assets through a
programmed allocation of available financial resources. The capital assets of the Authority are varied and
include such items as buses, rail cars, rail right-of-way infrastructure, facilities, equipment, non-revenue
vehicles, and other capital assets needed to support the on-going operations of the Authority. The life cycle
of these capital assets extends over a period of years and effective capital improvement planning provides
the framework for scheduling improvements based on the availability of resources, the condition of assets,
and the priorities among submitted capital projects. The capital-intensive nature of public transportation
makes long-term financial planning, as well as effective implementation and completion of programmed
capital projects on a timely basis, indispensable.
As in previous years, additional financial resources continue to be needed to meet the needs of maintaining
the Authority’s capital assets in a State of Good Repair (SOGR). In recent budget years, due to the improved
financial conditions of the Authority additional funds were transferred to the capital program by strategically
reducing grant funded Preventive Maintenance (PM) reimbursements to the Operating Budget and directing
more resources towards capital asset improvements. The Authority has also aggressively pursued all
eligible competitive grant awards for identified, but unfunded SOGR projects. The Ohio Department of
Transportation (ODOT) authorized $3.67 million of Urban Transit Program (UTP) funding to the Authority.
This funding will be used to purchase 3 additional MCIs and 5 Gillig buses. ODOT also authorized $11.66
million of Ohio Transit Partnership Program (OTPP) funding, which will be used to purchase property along
E. 79th Street Station along the Red Line, Preventive Maintenance Reimbursement (in exchange for Federal
Formula Funding) and Heavy Rail Vehicles. The Federal Formula funding originally to be used for Preventive
Maintenance Reimbursement, will be amended to help fund the Light Rail trunk line track project.
The allocation of capital funds and budget authority continues to target a significant number of SOGR
projects throughout the Authority. Financial resources for capital projects are allocated through a capital
review process that prioritizes both budgeted, unfunded capital projects as well as consideration of new
capital projects. It maintains the focus of the Authority’s capital program on achieving and maintaining a
SOGR throughout the system as it continues to reflect existing and future projected financial and operational
constraints facing the Authority. The challenges include maintaining bus and rail fleets in a SOGR,
maintaining rail infrastructure, facilities, and bridges awarding of funds. The Authority’s capital projects are
grouped in the 2020-2024 Capital Improvement Plan shown on the following page.

CONCLUSION
GCRTA has managed well over the past six years. The 2020 budget maintains current service levels. As
in the past, the GCRTA will closely monitor expenses and take the necessary actions as the budgeted
operating reserve falls.
GCRTA must continue to align expenses with revenues, improve its operational efficiencies and
effectiveness to provide quality service and meet its commitments to its customers, while at the same time,
it must maintain the necessary funds to sustain operations and keep its infrastructure in a state of good
repair. The proposed 2020 General Fund and the Other Fund Budgets achieve that goal, but at the same
time indicate that challenges lie ahead in the upcoming years.
The General Fund Balance Analysis and Financial Policy Goals for the Proposed 2020 Budget are below.
