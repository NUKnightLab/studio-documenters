Parkside 4 Phase 2 is comprised of 134 rental units and 56 for-sale townhome units. The 134
rental units will consist of 54 units for CHA residents, 44 affordable units and 36 market rate
units. The for-sale phase will consist of 56 townhome market rate units. The rental phase and
for-sale phase will close simultaneously.
