WHEREAS, as part of that mandate to protect the people of the County, County government has the
authority and obligation to do business with individuals and corporations that take into account the
interests and needs of the County and its residents; and
WHEREAS, Bank of America (“Bank”) has recently shown that it does not fully take into account the
long term interests and needs of the County or the businesses and residents of the County by its
precipitous actions regarding Republic Windows and Doors and by its failure to anticipate the significant
repercussions of the Bank’s actions on the workers at Republic Windows and Doors; and
WHEREAS, it is required that all zoning decisions, sale of bonds and deposits of County funds are
subject to the approval of the Cook County Board of Commissioners (“the Board”) and that the Board is

A RESOLUTION IN SUPPORT OF HOWE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER AND
TINLEY PARK MENTAL HEALTH CENTER
WHEREAS, the Howe Developmental Center (Howe DC) in Tinley Park, Illinois is a home for 320
severely developmentally disabled individuals with complicated multiple disabilities and behavioral
issues who are unable to speak for themselves and require a voice in their support, and for whom
community placements are not appropriate; and
WHEREAS, Howe DC has small homes on a campus setting and offers extensive supports such as
psychiatric and behavioral services, 24/7 nursing care, access to medical services on grounds and at the
University of Illinois Hospital, and on site medical and dental clinics, all of which are not readily
available in community group homes; and
WHEREAS, the Tinley Park Mental Health Center (Tinley Park MHC) in Tinley Park, Illinois provides a
safe and secure treatment setting for mentally ill individuals, including those who have no insurance or
who have exhausted their mental health coverage, for southern Cook County and the collar counties; and
WHEREAS, Governor Blagojevich’s administration has announced that it is closing both Howe DC and
Tinley Park MHC; and
WHEREAS, the administration says it will “redistribute” most of the residents from Howe DC to other
state-operated developmental centers, such as the Murray Developmental Center in downstate Centralia
some 250 miles away; and
WHEREAS, moving disabled individuals from their home and requiring families to travel great distances
to visit their loved ones will cause great harm and suffering; and
WHEREAS, shuttering Tinley Park MHC would dismantle a vital community resource that has taken
decades to develop, providing a well-staffed inpatient treatment center with professional and
paraprofessionals specially trained to serve patients suffering from very severe mental illness as well as
planning which links patients to community outpatient resources; and
WHEREAS, some 2,000 admissions annually to Tinley Park MHC are a clear indication of the great
need for its services, and the demand for services at the center; and
WHEREAS, there are no comparable alternatives to providing care to these populations in the south
suburban area, with services at community mental health centers structured to serve individuals who are
not in acute crisis while community group homes for the developmentally disabled are too under funded
and understaffed to handle individuals with complex needs; and
WHEREAS, without a strong, secure safety net for those most difficult to serve, too many individuals
will be lost to homelessness and incarceration; and
WHEREAS, Tinley Park MHC and Howe DC employ some 800 people in our region, and its workers
receive fair wages, good benefits and workplace rights.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners hereby
states its opposition to the closure of Howe Developmental Center and Tinley Park Mental Health Center
and urges Governor Blagojevich to reconsider his proposal to close these facilities; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners urges legislators in the
Illinois General Assembly to support the continued operation of Howe DC and Tinley Park MHC; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that suitable copies of this Resolution be delivered to Governor
Blagojevich, Senate President Emil Jones, Jr., House Speaker Michael J. Madigan, and all members of the
Illinois General Assembly who represent Cook County.

WHEREAS, Illinois Governor Rod R. Blagojevich has been arrested and charged with several violations
of Title 18 of the United States Code, including the attempted “sale” of the United States Senate Seat
vacated by President-Elect Barack Obama; and
WHEREAS, under this cloud of controversy, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada has issued a
statement urging Governor Blagojevich not to make an appointment to the vacant Senate seat, further
stating that the Senate would use its authority to refuse to allow any person appointed by Governor
Blagojevich to be seated; and
WHEREAS, Governor Blagojevich has been urged to resign by President-Elect Barack Obama, half of
the members of United States Senate, Lieutenant Governor Patrick Quinn, Illinois Attorney General Lisa

President Emil Jones called a special session of the State Legislature for the purpose of exercising their
right under the 17th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States to require a writ of election be
issued for the vacant Senate seat; and
WHEREAS, the cost of conducting a special election has been estimated at thirty-five million dollars
($35M) state-wide and potentially twenty million dollars ($20M) for the County of Cook with eight to ten
million dollars ($8-10M) for suburban Cook County and eleven million dollars ($11M) for the City of

Governor Rod R. Blagojevich to take appropriate action for the good of the people of the State of Illinois
and for the nation and resign his office immediately and allow the Lieutenant Governor to assume the
duties of the Office of Governor; and

A RESOLUTION CALLING ATTENTION TO AN INCREASE IN
THE CRIME OF ELDER ABUSE IN ORDER TO ENSURE THE SAFETY
OF COOK COUNTY OLDER ADULTS
WHEREAS, elder abuse cases are increasing on an annual basis and that number will continue to
increase in light of the recession; and
WHEREAS, the Illinois Department on Aging estimates that only 13% of elder abuse cases are ever
reported and very few of those are ever prosecuted. In the last year there were 3,831 reports of elder
abuse in all of Cook County; and
WHEREAS, by 2010, the number of older adults in Suburban Cook County alone will increase by 15.5%
or 66,000; and
WHEREAS, seniors are particularly at risk of financial exploitation such as the fraudulent use of
quitclaim deeds, forgery (frequently by friends and family) and misuse of power of attorneys, all crimes
that are difficult to prove; and
WHEREAS, Age Options, the designated Regional Administrative Agency in Suburban Cook County
for the State Elder Abuse and Neglect Program has asked that elder abuse issues become a county-wide
priority and that the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office receive adequate resources to increase the
prosecution rate of elder abuse.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County work
with the aging network, law enforcement and the judicial system to increase collaboration and
communication to ensure the safety and protection of the vulnerable older adult population of Cook
County.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that suitable copies of this Resolution be presented to the
Constitutional officers of the State of Illinois, President and Minority Leader of the Illinois Senate and the
Speaker and Minority Leader of the Illinois House of Representatives.

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a copy of this Resolution be spread upon the official proceedings

license to Mr. Clyde Black, to use and occupy a portion of the County Building lobby at 118 North Clark

AGREEMENT AMENDMENT continued
ITEM #37 cont’d
Over the summer months, Mr. Black fell behind in paying the license fee. He has indicated that his
business, which is always more depressed in the summer, has declined overall. Changing fashions
coupled with an economic downturn have severely impacted his business. Mr. Black currently owes
approximately $1,700.00 in back license fees.
Mr. Black has asked to re-negotiate the terms of his license agreement, based on financial hardship. He
has indicated that he cannot pay the arrearage and will not be able to pay the full $300.00 per month.
Based upon discussions with Mr. Black, and the belief that the service offered by his shoe shine stand is
an amenity to occupants of the County Building and the public, the Real Estate Management Division is
recommending that the arrearage be forgiven and that the License Agreement be amended as follows:
Licensor:
Licensee:
Location:

County of Cook
Mr. Clyde Black
118 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois 60602

Term:

Three years, commencing 12/1/08, to be renewed thereafter annually unless

License Fee:

Space Occupied:

Termination:

either party on 30 days notice; immediately by County in the event of default
by Licensee under the License.
