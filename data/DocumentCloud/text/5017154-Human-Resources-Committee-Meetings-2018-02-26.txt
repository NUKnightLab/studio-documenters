During the discussion of information regarding mandatory continuing education for nurses and physicians,
Director Driscoll inquired whether the organization assists in providing training opportunities that will satisfy
those requirements. Ms. Pryor responded that she will follow-up on that question; she noted that the organization
does provide in-house training for nurses in cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Director Driscoll also inquired
whether the organization offers any training or educational sessions for staff relating to understanding population
health, which would be beneficial for staff. Mr. Elwell responded in the negative; he stated that he will look into
the subject for future consideration.

Report from Chief of Human Resources (continued)
With regard to mandatory continuing education for staff attorneys, Jeff McCutchan, General Counsel, stated that
the attorneys have memberships with the Chicago Bar Association that allows them to not only take courses
online, but tracks their progress as well. At this point, membership is on an individual basis, but they are looking
into whether they can get a group membership at a reduced price. In his department, they also have to show that
they are licensed annually; those records are submitted to the Human Resources Department.
During the discussion of the metrics on open vacancies, Mr. Elwell noted that the number of open vacancies is
currently at 898; that number is higher than what has been previously reported, due to a couple of reasons,
including: 1) approximately 130 positions were added at the end of the fiscal year through the budget amendment
process, which staff continues to process; and 2) they are reconciling data between CCHHS and the County
regarding anomalies where people are left in closed positions or instances where two (2) people are linked to a
single position, relating to leave of absences. Chairman Richardson-Lowry requested that the Committee receive
additional information on the 898 open vacancies in some detail, to inform their thinking moving forward.
