EXPLANATION
In March 2011, the Board of Commissioners approved an award to exercise second one-year
option with of an agreement with Integrys Energy Services, Inc. for the supply of natural gas to
various CHA residential sites and facilities. Contract Amendment No. 2 will expire on March
3 1 20 1 2.

The Natural Gas Supply and Delivery Agreement (the ?Agreement?) offers CHA the opportunity
to purchase its natural gas supply needs at wholesale instead of retail, and enables the CHA to
hedge against potential market price ?uctuations through use of multi-tiered pricelrisk
management options.

An extension of the Agreement would allow the CHA to continue to purchase natural gas
supplies from non-retail utility sources and thereby reduce the overall gas costs. The
Department of Housing and Urban Development has historically offered incentives to housing
authorities that purchase their natural gas supplies at wholesale costs (wellhead) that are less than
what the local retail utility would ordinarily charge. It is critical that the CHA continue to reduce
its energy costs through gas purchases made under the wellhead program.

Under Contract #8014 natural gas is supplied to multiple CHA family and senior developments.
The following table shows the usage and cost of natural gas in 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011:

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Usa 
Year (then-?ns) Cost
2008 14,601,540 $12,910,760
2009 12,000,990 7,679,278
2010 9,307,562 4,483,461
2011 8,321,629 3,611,994
TOTAL 44,231,721 28,685,493

 

aggregate natural gas usage in 2011 was 10.59% less than in 2010 and 43.00% less than
in 2008 for the portfolio properties subject to the Agreement, and the respective costs were
approximately 19.44 and 72.03% less over the same periods. The decreases in the 
natural gas consumption and costs were primarily due to price/risk management strategies,
building consolidations and closures, and energy-ef?cient retro?ts.

CHA is recommending that Contract #8014 be extended for twelve (12) months by exercising
the third one year option, from April 1, 2012 through March 31, 2013, in an amount not-to-
exceed $4,106,913, to allow the CHA to continue to purchase natural gas supplies from non-
retail utility sources and thereby reduce the overall gas costs. It is critical to the CHA
that the agency be able to continue to reduce its energy costs through gas purchases made under
the wellhead program.

March 985,536 $0.5058 $498,514
Totals: 8,713,649 $4,106,913

Based on the foregoing, it is in the best interest of the CHA to authorize the Chief Executive
Of?cer or his designee to execute an amendment extending Contract #8014 with Integrys Energy
Services, Inc, for the period of April 1, 2012 through March 31, 2013 to purchase natural gas
supplies for an amount not-to-exceed $4,106,913.
