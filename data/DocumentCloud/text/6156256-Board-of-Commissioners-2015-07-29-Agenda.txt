Capital Planning and Policy

Summary: The Department of Capital Planning and Policy, as authorized by the Cook County Chief
Procurement Officer, plans to participate in the Cook County’s Job Order Contract (JOC) program to
complete the four (4) capital projects listed below. JOC is a quantity based procurement process that
allows facility owners to complete a multitude of repair/maintenance and construction projects with a
single, competitively bid contract. The JOC process generally involves first selecting a pool of potential
contractors through a competitive procurement process, and then identifying projects for such selected
contractors.
The County has already completed a JOC competitive procurement process, and it has created the pool of
generated contractors to perform certain projects generally associated with Maintenance, repairs,
replacement and routine work.

Page 43 of 98

BOARD AGENDA

July 29, 2015

The JOC program has an administrative component managed by the Gordian Group. The Gordian Group
maintains an area price book, which captures the prices for specific construction work items within this
region. JOC contractors bid against the prices included in the price book. The cost, therefore, of any
work performed by the contractor is a contractor markup form the price book. The Gordian Group would
receive 5% administrative fee from Cook County based on the total project cost of the work. The
Gordian Group will manage the JOC process and will verify that all proposals and work are compliant
with the terms and conditions outlined in the JOC contract within the County.The Department of Capital
Planning and Policy, proposes to assign the projects listed below to the Gordian Group to share with
participating JOC contractors.
Project Descriptions:
Fire & Life Safety Emergent Upgrade Project- The Boot Camp is located on the Department of
Corrections Campus, in Chicago, Illinois. The Complex is made up of 10 separate one story Army style
dormitories and constructed in the late 1990’s. The Boot Camp has since been moved out of that location
and the Sheriff’s Office is in the process of making minor renovations to the complex and will re-open the
renovated facility with a new Fire Alarm & Detection System. This project estimated additional cost is
$600,000.00.
Fire & Life Safety Upgrade Project- Per the City of Chicago’s mandate, all building owners of existing
high-rise buildings are to have a “Life Safety Evaluation Report,” prepared by an architect, listing the
building’s structure and system components that may compromise the life safety of its occupants. The
report was prepared and filed with the city in December 2005. This project estimated cost is $50,000.00.
Cook County Sheriff Vehicle Storage Relocation - This project’s objective is to relocate the Sheriff’s
Vehicle Services offices and fleet operations from 10351 South Woodlawn, Chicago, Illinois 60628, to the
Department of Highway and Transportation District-3 property, located at 901West 26th Street, LaGrange,
Il 60525. District 3 activities & personnel are to be transferred to District 4. This project estimated
additional cost is $190,000.00.
DOC Selective Roof Replacements - Various Buildings - This project is to address roofing issues at the
DOC in order to resolve severe leaking conditions that have a critical impact to the operations of various
buildings on the DOC Campus. The intent is to be able to address some of the more severe conditions until

Section 3. The Bureau of Human Resources shall publicly post or keep available for inspection by any

Section 5. The Bureau of Human Resources shall promptly file a certified copy of this Ordinance with
both the Secretary of State Index Division and the Department of Labor of the State of Illinois.
Section 6. The Bureau of Human Resources shall cause to be published in a newspaper of general

determination is effective and that this is the determination of this public body.
Section 7. The Purchasing Agent of Cook County shall specify in the call for bids in any contract for
public works that the general prevailing rate of wages in the locality for each craft or type of laborer or

holiday and overtime work as ascertained by the Bureau of Human Resources, shall be paid for each craft
or type of work needed to execute the contract or to perform such work. The Purchasing Agent in
awarding the contract shall cause to be inserted in the contract a stipulation to the effect that not less than
the prevailing rate of wages, as found by the Bureau of Human Resources, shall be paid to all laborers,
workers and mechanics performing work under the contract, and the Purchasing Agent shall also require
in all such contractor's bonds that the contract include such provision as will guarantee the faithful
performance of such prevailing wage clause as provided by the contract.
Section 8. In the case of any underpayment of the prevailing wage, a penalty of 20% of the
underpayment shall be assessed against the contractor or subcontractor; and the 20% penalty shall be

The Chief Procurement Officer concurs.
Summary: In collaboration with the Cook County Offices of the Assessor, Clerk, Treasurer, Board of
Review, and Recorder of Deeds, the Bureau of Technology seeks Board approval of a contract with Tyler
Technologies, Inc. to replace the County’s legacy property tax system. The County currently employs
40-year-old technology to manage and implement tax collection across 1,500 taxing districts. The
system incurs more than $5M per year in support costs and depends upon inflexible and disparate legacy
systems, including paper-based validation of system reports. These costs are expected to increase as the
IT industry and future generations of IT professionals abandon the legacy technology upon which the
County’s property tax domain currently depends.
The proposed contract will re-engineer business processes and workflows through the implementation of
modern technology and provide myriad benefits, including increased property tax revenue from
improved assessment, appraisal, and collection operations, an improved ability to accommodate property
tax workloads without requiring additional staff, and enhanced public services and responsiveness for
County tax payers.
Request for Proposals (RFP) procedures were followed in accordance with the Cook County
Procurement Code. Tyler Technologies, Inc. was recommended based on established evaluation criteria.

extend the term of Contract No. 08-45-256 by 9 months and lower the cost of telephone calls that
detainees in County facilities place to family, friends, and private defense counsel.
The proposed amendment will significantly lower the cost of detainee phone calls by reducing account
funding fees by approximately 43%, lowering the contractual per-minute call rate by approximately 14%,
and securing a competitive flat rate for international calls. The extension will provide the County with
service while County agencies complete an ongoing competitive RFP process for a new communications

The Circuit Court Criminal Division’s Adult Redeploy Illinois, Access to Community Treatment (ACT)
Court seeks to help certain low-level criminal defendants suffering from substance abuse problems from
becoming repeat offenders and being incarcerated. The ACT Court achieves this goal by providing
behavioral health, vocational and educational treatment services from community-based sources, such as
TASC, combined with intensive court supervision. As of 3/31/2015, 106 participants have been admitted
into the program. The program has achieved a retention rate of 79 percent, well above the rate of drug
courts nationally, despite the challenging nature of the population. As the Designated State Agency for
court treatment programs as a condition of probation, TASC is the only authorized contractor and is
uniquely qualified to act as an intermediary between the court system and the treatment community.
This is a Sole Source Procurement pursuant to Section 34.-139 of the Cook County Procurement Code.

Project.
From Account(s): 335-240, $40,759.00

Total Amount of Transfer: $40,759.00
On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds

BOARD AGENDA

July 29, 2015

in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
5/15/2015, $0.00, $2,300.00
How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
Account 335-240, Printing and Publishing, was identified as the source of the transfer of funds to provide
additional encumbrance for professional services of three I.T. programmers. This is because the
purchase of Personal Issue Traffic tickets for the City of Chicago and Suburban Traffic Tickets in 2014
with FY 2014 funds, while awaiting the bid and award of a new traffic ticket contract, reduced the need
for a larger order of tickets in 2015. The new contract was awarded and a purchase order was received
on 4/8/2015. The order is currently in process and, therefore, additional tickets will not be needed until
FY 2016, hence the availability of funds for the transfer.
Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from.
None
If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
As a result of supplemental tickets ordered in 2014 with FY 2014 funds, we anticipate an additional FY
2015 order for traffic tickets will be less than previously anticipated, hence the availability of funds in
Account 335-240 for the transfer.

standard for inspector general offices nationwide as well as law enforcement agencies.
