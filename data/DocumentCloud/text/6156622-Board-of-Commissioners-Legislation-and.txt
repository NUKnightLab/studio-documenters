PROPOSED RESOLUTION
PROTECTING ACCESS TO COMPREHENSIVE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE AND
SUPPORTING INCREASED FUNDING LEVELS

 WHEREAS, women need access to safe, affordable, and comprehensive reproductive health care throughout
their lives, including screening for cancer and sexually transmitted infections, contraceptiveservices, abortion
care, prenatal care, and labor and delivery services; and
WHEREAS, reproductive health is a vital component of a woman’s overall health, and reproductive freedom is
vital to a woman’s safety, well-being, and ability to participate equally in society; and
WHEREAS, on January 22, 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court, in a historic and landmark decision, ruled in Roe v.
Wade that the U.S. Constitution safeguards a woman’s ability to make her own personal medical decisions about
when or whether to have children; and
WHEREAS, that decision has allowed women to participate more fully in society, saved lives, and strengthened
families and we must always guard against efforts to deliberately erode the availability and affordability of
abortion and undermine the protections provided by Roe v. Wade; and
WHEREAS, the majority of Americans continue to support safe, legal abortion; and
WHEREAS, federal and state laws that place obstacles in the paths of women seeking abortion care take away
the ability of those women to make decisions and threaten the health of families; and
WHEREAS, one such restriction is the Hyde Amendment, passed by Congress on September 30, 1976, which
for nearly 39 years has impeded access to abortion care for low-income women enrolled in
Medicaid; and
WHEREAS, Medicaid coverage for abortion care has a significant effect on low-income women’s ability to
decide to end an unwanted pregnancy, and in the absence of such coverage many women are unable to obtain an
abortion; and
WHEREAS, many women in Cook County, including state and federal employees, obtain insurance coverage
through other public insurance programs that also restrict coverage for abortion; and
WHEREAS, all women should have insurance coverage for comprehensive reproductive health care, including
abortion care, to ensure that their economic status or the source of their insurance coverage does not affect
important health care decisions or access; and
WHEREAS, millions of women nationally, and hundreds of thousands in Illinois and Cook County, are subject
to these inequitable policies; and
WHEREAS, public health insurance should cover all of a woman’s options when she is facing an unintended
pregnancy, so that she is able to make a real decision about what is best for her and her family; and
WHEREAS, Cook County provides important support for many women to ensure that they have access to
comprehensive reproductive health care, including abortion, but regardless of the resources dedicated by Cook
County, bans on coverage for abortion continue to harm many women; and
WHEREAS, it is imperative that funding of comprehensive reproductive health care be increased and that
abortion be covered as part of comprehensive reproductive health care in all public insurance programs to ensure
that services are accessible for women who are enrolled in such programs.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and members of the Board of Commissioners of
Cook County call upon federal and state elected officials to maintain the protections established by Roe v. Wade
for access to comprehensive reproductive health care and undo restrictions that have been placed on those
protections; and

 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the President and members of the Board of Commissioners of Cook
County call for increased federal and state funding for comprehensive reproductive health care and to reinstate
coverage for abortion services for women enrolled in public insurance programs.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
RESOLUTION OPPOSING THE CREATION OF LOCAL RIGHT TO WORK ZONES IN ILLINOIS
WHEREAS, Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner has repeatedly called for the creation of local right to work zones,
in which voters could decide if workers in their communities employed in unionized industries can opt out of
paying dues to labor organizations; and
WHEREAS, Governor Rauner has asked for city councils across Illinois to consider a resolution asking for voter
referendums to allow local right to work zones, as well as changes to prevailing wage laws and worker
compensation laws; and
WHEREAS, such action has the potential to further dismantle unionized labor organizations, which have
historically protected the rights of working and middle-class Illinoisans and could lead to lower wages, reduced
benefits, and poor working conditions for employees whether they are union or non-union; and
WHEREAS, Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan released an opinion last week unequivocally declaring that
the concept of local right to work zones presented by Governor Rauner would violate the National Labor
Relations Act (NLRA); and
WHEREAS, the Attorney General opinion additionally states that “counties and municipalities, whether home
rule or non-home-rule, as well as all other political subdivisions, units of local government, and school districts of
this State, are precluded by federal law from enacting ordinances and resolutions that limit or restrict the use of
union security agreements. Further, current law does not authorize the creation, through the passage of a
referendum, of “right to work” zones or local areas wherein union security agreements will not be recognized.”;
and
WHEREAS, although Illinois courts have not had to address this matter previously, courts of other jurisdictions
and other state Attorneys General that have opined on the matter have uniformly concluded that the NLRA
preempts the prohibition of union security agreements by units of local government in all instances relating to
interstate commerce and that the lone exception to federal preemption authorizes only states and territories, and
not their political subdivisions, to prohibit union security agreements; and
WHEREAS, this latest attack on collective bargaining is an attempt to weaken organized labor and will not
make Illinois a more competitive business environment, evidenced by the fact that similar laws in other states
have had no significant impact on attracting employers to a particular state;
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners hereby opposes the
proposal to create local right to work zones in Illinois as such action would violate current federal and state laws
and would negatively impact collective bargaining and hurt hard-working middle-class employees and their
families in Illinois; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that in light of the current federal and Illinois laws, the Cook County Board of
Commissioners urges local government subdivisions within Cook County to refrain from considering and
adopting resolutions asking the Illinois Legislature to allow local right to work zones.
