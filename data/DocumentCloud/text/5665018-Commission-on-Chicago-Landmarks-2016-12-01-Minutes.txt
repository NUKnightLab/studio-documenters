COMMISSION ON CHICAGO LANDMARKS
January 5, 2017

meeting was held at 121 N. LaSalle St., in Room 201-A.

The following projects were reviewed by the PRC:
1. 1060 W. Addison
44th Ward
Wrigley Field
Proposed enlargement of two existing openings in the brick outfield wall from 11’8”-wide to 20’-wide, new code compliant railing design standard for the grandstand
ramps and bowl area, and a new canopy above the ticket windows.
Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. Given the historic photo which shows large openings in the outfield
brick wall, the two existing masonry openings may be enlarged from
11’-8”-wide to 20’-wide to accommodate visibility/access to and from
the new bullpens and the playing field. The doors shall use chain link
fencing to match the existing field entrance door in right field. No
other door materials are approved at this time and any alternative
materials would only be considered after review of an on-site mock-up
and then reviewed for approval at a future Permit Review Committee
meeting;
2. Considering the existing grandstand ramp and bowl pipe railings do
not meet code, the railings may be catalogued, salvaged, and once the
lead paint has been removed tested for strength/ductility to determine
which components can be re-used/re-welded as outlined by the ICON
email dated 11/18/16. These components shall be reused as much as
reasonably possible to construct the new pipe railings, designed to be
taller and to incorporate diamond mesh panels to meet code
requirements. Any minor design modifications, such as incorporating

 an intermediate horizontal pipe rail, if required by National Park
Service, may be reviewed for approval by Historic Preservation
staff. A mock-up of the final design of the railing shall be reviewed
for approval by Historic Preservation staff;
3. The new canopy above the ticket window signs, proposed to be
painted to match the color of the stucco, is approved. The color and
finish of the canopy may also be exposed stainless steel to match the
ticket window frames. Enlarged details shall be included in the permit
plans; and,
4. Approval condition #1 is subject to further staff review and
coordination with Commissioner Rossi, the applicant, and NPS to
consider both proposed size and door treatment of the masonry
openings in the outfield wall and will report back to the Committee at
a future meeting. After the meeting, Commissioner Rossi declined to
be the appointed Commissioner for this further review and
Commissioner Houlihan agreed to take his place.
11th Ward
2. 1010 W. 35th
Spiegel Administration Building
Proposed two 60’ x 6’ vinyl wall signs mounted to east and west facades.
Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. As clarified by the applicant, these signs will be temporary, installed
for up to a year. As such, the permit applications will be modified to
identify that these signs are temporary only and will be removed by
12/1/17;
2. After the signs are removed, the brick and mortar damaged by the sign
installation will be repaired as needed to match historic appearance;
and,
3. Any future signs require the Commission’s review and approval prior
to installation.
