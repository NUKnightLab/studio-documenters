2010, 2024, 2026, 2028, 2030, and 2032 Pine Street (Recommend APPROVAL)

The of?ce of the City Planning Commission (CPC) has received ten applications for
Neighborhood Enterprise Zone (NEZ) certi?cates forwarded from the of?ce of the City Clerk.
Corktown Housing LLC has submitted the subject application to construct two buildings with a
total of ten townhome?style condominiums.

CPC staff con?rms the ten condominiums as being located within the boundaries of the
Corktown North NEZ which was established by City Council on December 9, 2008 and should
be eligible for NEZ certi?cates under State Act 147 of 1992 as currently written. The NEZ
certi?cate applications appears to have been submitted prior to the issuance of any applicable

MEMORANDUM

TO: Mr. David Whitaker, Legislative Policy Division Director

THRU: The Honorable Council President, Brenda Jones

FROM: Council Member Gabe 

DATE: January 16, 2019

RE: Resolution to grant furloughed federal employees an extension on city

payments during the government shutdown

 

Federal government furloughed employees don't deserve to be treated as political pawns. We
should Show our support and give them a hand during this dif?cult time. The hard working
employees of the federal government, including many residents of Detroit, are the ones
paying the price for this shutdown. We should do what we can to give them a hand until the
shutdown is over.

I am requesting that the Legislative Policy Division develop a resolution to grant furloughed
federal employees an extension on city payments, including water bills, permits, parking and
taxes.

The extension should extend for the length of the shutdown plus an additional 60 days after it
ends to allow the employees to catch up on their ?nancial obligations.

Thank you!
