Action Items
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)
With regard to request number 2, Mr. Elwell noted that SCR Transportation was the organization historically
used for transportation of indigent patients, as well as for CountyCare patients. During the course of the
contract, it was determined that they were not Medicaid-certified, so they were not able to continue to provide
encounters. That contract was terminated and another vendor was selected to provide those services. As the
contract with SCR Transportation came to a close, an estimate was made regarding the amount owing to SCR
Transportation; however, CountyCare’s membership had doubled its volume in the last six (6) months of the
contract, so the estimated amount was not enough to completely cover the remaining invoices. This amount
requested today should bring the amounts owing to a close. This type of issue is not expected to happen with
the current vendor, First Transit. First Transit is a transportation broker, and they require that their
transportation providers are Medicaid-certified. Additionally, the way in which they bill allows CCHHS
management to monitor whether additional funds are needed before the contract funds are depleted.
During the discussion of request number 5, Director Richardson-Lowry inquired whether there has been an
assessment of the added value of leasing versus purchasing certain types of equipment. Additionally, she
inquired regarding the maintenance/evaluation process used for leased equipment. Mr. Elwell responded that
the System’s clinical engineering department handles all repairs to those types of equipment; if it turned out
that it was not a good piece of equipment, it would be returned to Banc of America for a replacement.
Mr. Elwell provided additional information and a detailed overview of request number 9. He stated that,
approximately eighteen (18) months ago, IlliniCare was brought in as the Third Party Administrator (TPA) for
the CountyCare Health Plan (CountyCare). At that time, CountyCare was primarily in the Affordable Care
Act (ACA) adult population business; IlliniCare was primarily involved in the Integrated Care Program (ICP)
and as the TPA for CountyCare. Those were very different businesses at that time – the administration was
very focused on what they were doing and did not see any issues, plus it was hard to predict what the market
would be like in the future. As time went on, the market consolidated, and IlliniCare has now become a major
competitor. The administration felt that it was not in CountyCare’s best interest to continue with IlliniCare,
based on the fact that they are a direct competitor.
Mr. Elwell noted that the first time that the administration went through the Request for Proposals (RFP)
process for TPA services in 2013, there was literally one (1) responder. This time, a total of twenty-two (22)
responses were received; four (4) responses were specifically for the piece relating to TPA services.
Steven Glass, Executive Director of Managed Care, stated that the RFP was constructed with six (6) scopes of
work – one of those scopes of work, Care Management, was withdrawn; what was left was Third Party
Administration and Benefits Management for Dental, Pharmacy, Optical and Transportation Services.
RFP constructed with six (6) scopes of work – one was withdrawn, which left a total of five (5):
•
Third Party Administration
•
Benefits Management – Dental
•
Benefits Management – Pharmacy
•
Benefits Management – Optical
•
Benefits Management – Transportation
•
Care Management (withdrawn)

Action Items
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)
A question was raised regarding the identity of the other responders to the RFP. Jeffrey McCutchan, Associate
General Counsel, indicated that, pursuant to County Ordinances and CCHHS procurement rules, until this
contract is official and signed, that information should not be publicly revealed.
Mr. Elwell stated that the TPA is the critical piece in comparison to the other scopes of work. Part of what is
different between this and the previous agreement is that the administration separated out the care management
function from the function of the TPA. The reason for this is that, in working with Medical Home Network
(MHN), it was determined that MHN achieved fairly dramatic results in care management; based on that pilot,
the administration wants care management to occur at the practice level, rather than at the TPA level.
Information was provided on the intense review process used to select the vendor; it was noted that two (2) site
visits at the prospective vendors’ operations were conducted. One (1) of the four (4) responders pulled their
proposal from consideration at the last minute; it is believed that they withdrew because they may decide to
enter the market and eventually compete with CountyCare.
Mr. Glass provided information on the members who were involved in conducting the review of the responses
to the RFP. A core team, which included leadership within CountyCare and leaders across CCHHS, reviewed
all of the projects and scopes of work. As the core team worked on each of the different types of benefits
management proposals, different subject matter experts, both within the System and outside of it, were pulled
into the review. There were five (5) members on the core team; in terms of the different benefits management
evaluations, there might have been anywhere from seven (7) to ten (10) individuals involved, depending on
what section was being reviewed.
Core Team (reviewed all projects and scopes of work):
Steven Glass, Executive Director of Managed Care
Jerry Kiplinger, Director of Operations (CountyCare)
Aaron Galeener, Director of Finance (CountyCare)
Andrea Gibson, System Director of Project Management
Mary Sajdak, Senior Director of Integrated Care Management
Subject matter experts involved in the review of responses regarding the TPA services:
Anna Carvalho, Executive Director of the La Rabida care coordination entity (contracted vendor for
CountyCare)
Scott Andrle, CCHHS Managed Care Department
Individuals involved in the parallel review process relating to compliance:
Cathy Bodnar, Chief Compliance and Privacy Officer
Ryan Lipinski, CountyCare Compliance Officer
Dr. John Jay Shannon, Chief Executive Officer, stated that, for the record, all of those individuals involved in
the review comply with the conflict of interest policy and file their disclosures of interest on an ongoing basis;
they also signed confidentiality agreements specific to their review panel participation.

Action Items
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)
Mr. Elwell stated that Valence is a local organization; it is Chicago-based and has a good reputation. The
company has done a lot of work with hospitals relating to Blue Cross business; they also have Medicaid
experience, both with NorthShore’s Accountable Care Entity (ACE) and the Family Health Network (FHN),
which is the other Managed Care Community Network (MCCN). It is important to note that 30% of the
decision was based on price and 70% of the decision was based on quality indicators; Valence turned out to not
necessarily be the lowest cost respondent, but they were the highest value provider. Under this proposed
contract, Valence will be paid on a Per-Member-Per-Month (PMPM) basis for their services.
Mr. Glass provided additional information regarding the assessment of quality indicators involved in the
review. He stated that the 70% is based on their response and the team’s observations, the site visit and
follow-up testing, and observations that were related to all of the functional areas within the scope of work.
There were eight (8) functional areas that were assessed and evaluated: Health Plan Analytics, Back Office
Operations, IS Interface and Data Exchange, Member Services, Medical Management, Health Plan Functions
Support, Provider Relations Support, and Quality Analytics and Support. Valence scored very well and very
high in these functional areas.
In response to a question regarding which specific hospitals in the area use this vendor, Mr. Glass responded
that Edwards-Elmhurst, Lurie Childrens’ Hospital, NorthShore, Centegra and Ingalls use Valence.
In response to a question from Director Richardson-Lowry regarding benchmarking and internally tracking
performance standards, Mr. Glass stated that the mechanism for doing that is through the delegation oversight
process, which is established by CountyCare. Under the MCCN rules, and as required under the MCCN
contract executed between CCHHS/Cook County and the State, if CountyCare is going to delegate that out to
another entity, such as a TPA, it must have oversight and management processes for that. Those processes
include holding monthly meetings and reporting out to the leadership of CountyCare, as well as reporting out
to the leadership of CCHHS that serve on that committee. The key performance indicators (KPIs) come
directly out of the MCCN contract. He noted that there are instances where those requirements were made
tighter, in cases where the administration has wanted to see better performance than what is required by the
State to deliver.
Director Richardson-Lowry stated that, in looking at the company online, and looking at their executive
leadership and Board, it left her wanting on the diversity front; she asked whether that subject was addressed at
all during the negotiations, and if not, why not? Mr. Elwell stated that, at this point, the administration is still
in negotiations with them, so they will address that matter with them.
Mr. Scheer inquired regarding the control/ownership of CountyCare’s data and regarding the timeliness of data
interchanges between CountyCare and Valence. Mr. Glass stated that CountyCare owns the data; Valence is
required to provide access to the data, as well as provide downloads of the data at CountyCare’s request - it is
structured in the daily operations to receive that information on a regular basis. Mr. Elwell added that a
duplicate of the data is kept by CountyCare.

Action Items
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)
In response to a question from Director Junge regarding protections to ensure a smooth transition from
IlliniCare to Valence, Mr. Glass stated that the contracts with both vendors speak to services beyond
termination, and leaves open that the CCHHS Director of Supply Chain Management can define what those
services are. Those services include those relating to claims runout, submission of quality data, open
investigations and working through the transition. On the new TPA side, language is included in the contract
that speaks to receiving information and working in collaboration/partnership.
Dr. Shannon asked Mr. Glass to provide information on any changes, if anything, that the CountyCare
members will see at the time of transition; he noted that the transition is anticipated to take place effective
April 1, 2016. There has been a very public commitment from IlliniCare regarding their complete dedication
for a professional transition of services. Mr. Glass stated that, from a member perspective, the biggest thing
that they will see is a new member identification card that contains new information related to their benefits.
The phone number and website for member services will not change. He noted that, in the Valence contract,
CountyCare is not contracting for care coordination with the TPA and is no longer carving out behavioral
health services from the TPA. For those individuals who are receiving care coordination or care management
support, there will have to be a transition to a new care manager and a new care coordinator; discussions are
currently being held to prepare and ensure that this transition is seamless.
Mr. Glass provided information on the services that will be provided by IlliniCare beyond contract termination.
IlliniCare will be responsible for claims runout, which involves processing any claims with dates of service of
March 31, 2016 and prior; this typically takes nine (9) months. CountyCare’s vendors have six (6) months to
submit data for timely filing; allowing for a little bit of time for adjudication and reconciliation, that will run
about nine (9) months. There will be runout on open cases involving fraud, waste and abuse and those cases
under investigation; those are a little harder to predict when they will closed, but he is hoping to get those
closed within a similar nine (9) month timeframe. Prior authorizations will be transitioned; anything that
IlliniCare has already authorized has to transition over to Valence, so members will not be impacted in their
care.
Acting Chairman Hammock requested that Mr. Glass, Mr. Elwell and the project managers return to the
Committee in January to provide a more detailed description of the project plan for the transition. Director
Wiese requested information on the number of staff/employees that this contract covers. Mr. Elwell stated that
he can provide that information. Director Wiese requested that the Committee receive information specifying
the PMPM amount that Valence will be paid, once the contract is finalized and signed. Mr. Elwell stated that
the expectation of savings over the current cost is $10-15 million per year; Director Richardson-Lowry
requested that he report back to the Committee in approximately six (6) months so the Committee can get an
update in terms of the savings expected and realized.
Director Lerner suggested that, perhaps six (6) months into the contract, the Committee should have a post hoc
evaluation to review how the performance is going, what the metrics are for evaluating performance, etc.
Additionally, he stated that it would be helpful if, at the right time, representatives from Valence can come in
and have a conversation with the Finance Committee and/or Managed Care Committee, so people can get
comfortable with who they are, what they are doing, and how they are handling some of the diversity and
performance issues.

Action Items
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)
Mr. Glass stated that the evaluation committee, comprised of same group of individuals as mentioned earlier, is
working to finish the evaluations on the remaining four (4) scopes of work for Benefits Management of Dental,
Pharmacy, Optical and Transportation Services in order to present them for consideration at next month’s
meeting. Staff are also working to calculate what the claims costs will be for all of this – he hopes to be able to
bring that to the Committee in January.
Director Estrada, seconded by Director Wiese, moved the approval of request numbers
1 through 9. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

C. Proposed Transfers of Funds (Attachment #2)
During the discussion of the proposed Transfers of Funds, Mr. Elwell noted that the larger proposed transfers
are relating to CountyCare. These transfers are needed because CountyCare has a larger membership than was
anticipated and budgeted; as membership ran above that estimate, there were additional expenditures. Another
point regarding CountyCare is that efforts to bring more business in-house have not been as successful as
expected; he noted that staff are working on a number of strategies going forward to try to bring more business
in-house. He provided information on other strategies and plans being discussed, including those involving
benefit enhancements and narrowing of the network for some types of services. Director Richardson-Lowry
stated that it would be helpful to have a mid-year review of that subject, so that if there is some prioritization
that needs to happen in terms of trying to transition some things in-house, the Committee has an opportunity to
listen and opine.
Director Butler, seconded by Director Wiese, moved the approval of the proposed
Transfers of Funds. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

D. Proposed Resolutions authorizing management to close the following Oak Forest Health Center bank
accounts (Attachment #3) :
i. Charitable Fund and Patient Support Fund Accounts at MB Financial
ii. Patient Trust Fund Account at Suburban Bank and Trust
Director Butler, seconded by Director Wiese, moved the approval of the proposed
Resolutions authorizing management to close the Oak Forest Health Center Charitable
Fund and Patient Support Fund bank accounts at MB Financial and the Patient Trust
Fund bank account at Suburban Bank and Trust. THE MOTION CARRIED
UNANIMOUSLY.

Report from the Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Finance and Strategy (Attachment #4)
A. Metrics
B. Report of procurement and non-procurement matters for FY2015 – 3rd Quarter (deferred to December)
C. Report of emergency purchases (Attachment #5)
D. Group Purchasing Organization (GPO) Overview (Attachment #6)
E. CountyCare Update (Attachment #7)
Mr. Elwell reviewed the financial reports and information presented to the Committee included in Attachment #4.
He stated that, for the month of October, CountyCare did well, but on the acute care side, there was a drop in
activity; he believes that is due to the issue relating to capturing more CountyCare business in-house. Mr. Scheer
requested that the Committee hold a session that talks about that – plans/strategies, status and updates. Mr. Elwell
responded affirmatively; for next year, particularly in the Managed Care Committee, and also in the Finance
Committee, that will be the subject of almost every meeting – the progress being made on redeterminations and
capturing more business in-house. Both are significant issues, so reports will be provided on those subjects on a
regular basis.
During the discussion of the financial reports, Mr. Elwell stated that CCHHS has not been paid by the State for the
Family Health Plan (FHP) or ICP populations for the last four (4) months; it is believed that the State will owe
CCHHS approximately $122 million by November 30th. CCHHS has continued to make payments to the other
providers during this time period. Because the State was not paying CCHHS, CCHHS began to withhold
payments to the State – that seemed fair, but the representatives from the State did not agree, based on
conversations with them on the subject. He stated that the administration is working with the State on a
reconciliation process to say that this type of situation should not continue, and the State needs to move CCHHS up
to preferred vendor status. He noted that the County has some ability to loan the State money, to help draw down
the additional federal funds; the administration will look to make a deal like that before it allows itself to not be
paid at all.
Director Lerner stated that he has mentioned at Managed Care Committee meetingsthat there needs to be a
debate/discussion of the subject of broad versus narrow networks, what that means from a Managed Care point of
view and how that resolves itself in the financial performance. He has concerns relating to what may be an
overdependence and focus of bringing as many CountyCare patients in-house. Given the geographic dispersion, it
is unlikely that CCHHS will get 100% of those patients; that begs the question of an overall strategy about how to
manage this from a financial and patient care point of view going forward, as the ACA becomes much more statebased rather than federal-based and as other competitors come into the market. A service-specific strategic
direction needs to be determined, because what CCHHS will look like in 2020 from a hospital system and clinic
point of view may be very different from how it looks look today.
A report of an emergency purchase was presented to the Committee for their information. The GPO overview and
CountyCare update were reviewed and discussed later that day during the Board Meeting.

 The Birth of GPO’s
• In 1986, Congress granted GPOs in healthcare "Safe Harbor" from federal
anti-kickback statutes after successful lobbying efforts.
• By 2007, there were numerous healthcare GPOs, "affiliates" and
cooperatives in the United States that were collecting patronage dividends
from vendors in the form of administrative fees, or "remuneration."
• 96 percent of all acute-care hospitals and 98 percent of all community
hospitals held at least one GPO membership. Additionally, 97 percent of
all not-for-profit, non-governmental hospitals participated in some form of
group purchasing.

 Value of Group Purchasing Organizations - References

Lawton-Burns 2008
Schneller 2009

90-98% of hospitals belong to a GPO

Respondents purchased 72.8% of all their goods
and services through GPO’s

Hospitals route 66-72% of their supply
purchases through GPO’s

Average savings is 18.7%
Additional 9 FTE’s per hospital if GPOs did not
exist

Goldenberg 2009
Saved between 10 to 15 percent by channeling
their purchases through GPO’s
80 cents of each dollar of hospital nonpersonnel expenditure is channeled through
GPO’s

services purchased by health care systems
• Drives volume and reduces costs
• Drives efficiencies through the supply chain
• Monitors the market (budget impact, raw materials, supply
availability, new technologies)
• Provides transparency in procurement information for health
care systems
