between the parties that was approved by the District Court in December 2002 and the
entry of an Agreed Supplemental Order approved by the Court on May 18, 2006. This

Administrator (TA) by the District Court on August 14, 2007. The Board of
Commissioners agreed to the entry of the subject order during its meeting of July 31, 2007.

On June 18, 2008, the District Court entered an order amending this portion of the TA

INC. (ACLU), presented by the Of?ce of the State?s Attorney, regarding The American
Civil Liberties Union of Illinois (ACLU) v. Alvarez. Case No. 10-C-5235. On March 5,
2013, Judge Sharon Johnson Coleman in the Northern District of Illinois ordered the
Comptroller to pay the sum of $645,549.00 for all attorney fees, taxable costs, and non-

1, et seq.

 

On May 8, 2012, the United States Court Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed the
decision of the district court to dismiss this lawsuit and reinstated the matter against the
State?s Attorney. On May 29, 2012, the State?s Attorney ?led a petition for rehearing
which was denied on June 14, 2012. Subsequently, on November 26, 2012, the United
States Supreme Court denied to accept the State?s Attorney?s petition for a writ of
certiorari. Thereafter, on December 20, 2012, the district court granted the American Civil
Liberties Union?s motion for summary judgment and entered a permanent injunction
against the State?s Attorney from enforcement of the Illinois Eavesdropping Act in a
manner consistent with the court?s order. On March 5, 2013, the district court granted the

ITEM #34
Transmitting a Communication, dated February 28, 2013 from
LYDIA MURRAY, Chief Information Officer
and
SHANNON E. ANDREWS, Chief Procurement Officer
requesting authorization for the Chief Procurement Officer to enter into and execute Contract No. 13-28017 with Merrick & Company, Greenwood Village, Colorado, for a three (3) year ortho aerial imagery
project for Cook, DuPage, Kane, Kendall, Lake, McHenry and Will Counties. The seven (7) county
project for aerial imagery includes Global Positioning System (GPS) ground control, aerial imagery,
triangulation, prepare and update digital elevation model, rectify and mosaic digital ortho imagery,
geodatabase design, Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) metadata and project management.
Reason:

A regional Request for Proposal (RFP) was jointly developed by Cook, DuPage, Kane,
Kendall, Lake, McHenry and Will Counties for the selection of a company to perform aerial
imagery for data acquisition and sharing at county borders. After the completion of the RFP
process, the regional Geographic Information System (GIS) workgroup has recommended
Merrick & Company based on its ability to meet all technical specifications of the RFP.
Since Cook County has the largest, most complex territory in the region composing of dense
urban areas, airports and shore line environments, it is acting as the lead government project
manager for this initiative. Cook County beneficiaries of this project will be Cook County
municipalities which provide vital operations involving first responders, emergency planners,
remediation experts for homeland security, highway for transportation, emergency
management and disaster preparedness. This time sensitive project is performed in the spring
under “leaf-off” conditions.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $3,344,446.00 (FY 2013: $1,099,929.00; FY 2014: $1,099,743.00; and FY

ITEM #35
Transmitting a Communication, dated March 12, 2013 from
LYDIA MURRAY, Chief Information Officer
ANDREA GIBSON, Director, Department of Budget and Management Services
and
SHANNON ANDREWS, Chief Procurement Officer
requesting authorization for the Chief Procurement Officer to amend Contract No. 12-30-327 with
Catalyst Consulting Group, Inc., Chicago, Illinois, for Cook County Property Tax Web Portal
Enhancements, Taxing Agency Extranet (TEA) Enhancements and Budget Book Application Services.
Cook County first established a contract with Catalyst in 2012 referencing the City of Chicago’s master
consulting agreement (MCA) with contractor for Information Technology (IT) consulting services in the
categories of application development, database support and IT management consulting. This amendment
issues two (2) task orders to Catalyst (one for work with the Treasurer’s Office and one for work with the
Budget Office). The scope of work for these task orders are within the approved categories of the
reference contract.
The prior transaction for Contract No. 12-30-327 were for Budget and Management Services
($68,135.00) and Bureau of Technology ($144,900.00) approved by the board October 12, 2012.
Reason:

This is a joint initiative by the Bureau of Technology, County Treasurer and Budget and
Management Services. This contract is necessary for Property Tax Portal Enhancements,
which will provide an efficient way for taxpayers to view all property tax related information
under one site. The site will house information from all the property-tax related offices in
Cook County; Treasurer, Assessor, County Clerk, Recorder of Deeds and the Board of
Review; Taxing Agency Extranet (TEA) Enhancements, critical to the distribution function,
providing municipalities with single source details for understanding what’s distributed
against the levy; Budget Book Application Services for Budget and Management Services.

LYDIA MURRAY, Chief Information Officer
and
SHANNON E. ANDREWS, Chief Procurement Officer
requesting authorization for the Chief Procurement Officer to enter into and execute a contract with
Solutionary, Inc., Omaha, Nebraska, for information security consulting services.
Reason:

The Bureau of Technology (BOT) requests that the County procure information security
consulting services from Solutionary, Inc. including security assessments, credit card
compliance auditing and vulnerability testing. This is a comparable government procurement
under Section 34-140 of the Procurement Code, as the County of Allegheny, Pennsylvania (its
County Seat being Pittsburgh) awarded Contract No. 124164 to Solutionary, Inc. through a
Request for Proposal (RFP), #6438, issued July 2010, for information security services. The
scope of services matches the services required by Cook County and the prices that
Solutionary, Inc. commits to the County are favorable as those Solutionary, Inc. committed to
the County of Allegheny. Most importantly, Solutionary, Inc.'s services - which immediately
augment the efforts and priorities that BOT devotes to information security - will assist in
mitigating risk of a data security breach.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $368,400.00. Contract period: March 20, 2013 through March 19, 2016. (490441 Account).
Approval of this item would commit Fiscal Years 2014, 2015 and 2016 funds.

ITEM #37
Transmitting a Communication, dated February 26, 2013 from
LYDIA MURRAY, Chief Information Officer
and
SHANNON E. ANDREWS, Chief Procurement Officer
requesting authorization for the Chief Procurement Officer to enter into and execute Contract No. 13-8812439 with Globetrotters Engineering Corporation, Inc. (GEC), Chicago, Illinois, for Phase III of the
Broadband Network, which will consist of adding additional fiber optic cable between the Daley Center
and the County Building and 69 West Washington; Hawthorne Warehouse and Provident Hospital of
Cook County to the Network; and fiber locating services that are required by the City of Chicago due to
the County’s underground fiber optic cable. This is a comparable government procurement under Section
34-140 of the Procurement Code, as the State of Illinois awarded CMS Contract No. 1473740 to GEC,
through a Request for Proposal (RFP), for services. The prices that GEC commits to the County are at
least as favorable as those GEC committed to the State.
Reason:

The County recently completed construction of Phase I of the Broadband Network that
consisted of installing fiber from the Daley Center to City Hall and the Thompson Center.
Utilizing existing fiber from the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) at the Thompson Center to
the Polk Street Station, the County extended the Network to Stroger Hospital of Cook County.
Phase II Engineering is currently in process, which will extend the Network from Stroger
Hospital of Cook County to the 26th and California Courthouse and County Jail Complex,
including Cermak Health Services of Cook County.
Based on the high quality of professional engineering services provided by GEC during
Phases I and II, their in-depth experience and knowledge of the County’s requirements and
the need to complete this project in the most timely manner possible, the Bureau of
Technology respectfully requests a new contract to proceed with Fiber Optic Network Phase
III Engineering of the project.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $325,465.24. Contract period: March 21, 2013 through December 31, 2013.

$50,000.00

To Account 200-444

Total

$50,000.00

1.

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
It became apparent that Account 444 would need an influx on March 11, 2013. The balance on
March 11, 2013 $8,689.00 and on February 19, 2013 the account balance was $6,000.00.

2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
Account 450 had a significant balance with no major projects slotted at this time, therefore this
account was chosen. The only other account that could be used is 333. This account was not
considered because of the amount of purchasing that is done from this account and the history of
this account becoming under funded as the year progresses.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from 450.
Facilities would have to put off the repair of it's vehicle fleet which would cause our vehicles to be
in a state of disrepair.

4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.

The Budget Department has reviewed and has no objection to this transfer.

PROPOSED CONTRACT ADDENDUM continued
ITEM #57 cont’d
Reason:

DDW & Associates/REB Storage Systems International was selected from two (2) vendor
bids received through the open market bid process. The contract for the rental of shelving was
approved by the County Board on February 4, 2009. The vendor designed, installed and
anchored the shelving to the 89th Street warehouse floor. The temporary storage shelving
system was needed by the Clerk of the Circuit Court to maintain a total of 3,072 pallets of
court documents until space was made available at the new Cicero Record Center.
Due to the fact that the new Cicero Record Center construction completion date is the end of
June 2013, we believe that it is more cost effective and efficient to retain the expertise and
services of the current vendor.
If the current contract were to be rebid, the County would incur additional costs for the
reconstruction of shelving, reloading of pallets, and incur possible increases in labor costs
needed for staff to search for the location of pallets/documents during the reconstruction.
Additionally, the Clerk of the Circuit Court would experience delays in the retrieval and
delivery of court documents during the reconstruction of the shelving. The expiration date of
the current contract is February 15, 2013.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $68,139.50. Contract extension: February 16, 2013 through August 31, 2013.
(529-660 Account).
Sufficient funds are available in the Clerk of the Circuit Court Document Storage Fund.
The Chief Procurement Officer concurs.
Vendor has met the Minority and Women Business Enterprise Ordinance.

Adjusted amount:
Reason:

$1,844,401.00
350,000.00
$2,194,401.00

for sufficient time for the awarding of a consolidated contract for Substance Abuse and
Mental Health Treatment for male detainees. Using the successful model implemented by the
Sheriff's Women's Justice Programs, we will provide a continuum of care to male detainees in
the custody of the Sheriff's Office by consolidating the services of previously separate
contracts, and adding a much needed mental health component. The expiration date of the
current contract is March 31, 2013.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $350,000.00. Contract extension: April 1, 2013 through September 30, 2013.
(239-298 Account).
