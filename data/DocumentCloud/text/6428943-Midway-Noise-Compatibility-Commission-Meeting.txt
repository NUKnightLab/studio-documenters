 FINAL Minutes of the July 24, 2014, Meeting of the
Midway Noise Compatibility Commission
Airline Fleet Mix Report
There was an average of 695 total operations per day with 82 occurring at night.
Southwest Airlines had the highest operations with an average of 448 per day, of
which 58 occurred at night.
The B737, used almost exclusively by Southwest, was the most used aircraft with
an average of 460 operations per day. Per the Commission’s request, in addition
to the breakdown by type of aircraft, the report also includes a breakdown of the
number of helicopter operations per day which averaged 5.
Permanent Noise Monitor Locations
The report indicates the addresses of the 12 noise monitor locations near the
airport as reflected in relation to the 2018 Noise Contour. The report shows the
results for July 2013 through June 2014 with quarterly breakdowns and a 12
month average. The 2nd quarter 2014 results are compared to those of the 2nd
quarter 2013.
Noise Hotline Report
There were 594 total complaints for the 2nd quarter, with a total of 132
complainants. Typically the breakdown included 5 or 6 communities, this report
includes complaints from 18 communities. This is due to the new flight
procedures that have been implemented. Of the total complaints 396 came from
Chicago, which is more than the typical number, due to the 22L procedures that
were implemented in February 2014.
Chairman Baliga asked if it is possible to breakdown the Chicago complaints by
neighborhood. Mr. Frame confirmed that it can be done.
B. Part 36 Noise Standards: Aircraft Type and Airworthiness Certification
Report
Any aircraft flying in the United States must meet the Part 36 standards to
receive a new or revised airworthiness certification. Noise measurements are
taken and the aircraft are grouped into different stages. Stage 1 includes airlines
over 75,000 pounds which were phased out in the 1980’s and Stage 2 are
airlines that were phased out by January 1, 2000. The Stage 1 and 2 aircraft
under 75,000 pounds will be phased out by 2015. Currently no Stage 3 phaseout is scheduled. Stage 4 was added in 2005 which includes aircraft certified by
the FAA after that year. All of the aircraft indicated on the Airline Fleet Mix
Report fall under Stage 3 and would meet Stage 4 requirements if certified today.
CHAIR’S REPORT
A. Residential Sound Insulation Sub-Committee Report

 FINAL Minutes of the July 24, 2014, Meeting of the
Midway Noise Compatibility Commission
Mr. Frame elaborated on the report by commenting on the property inspections
and the status of Phase 15. He stated that the first two briefings were for
condominiums and large scale apartment buildings already zoned multi-family.
The RSIP property inspections documented building conditions according to the
checklist provided by the Department of Buildings. If the checklist indicated
atypical conditions, then the property was referred to the Department of Buildings
for further review.
Chairman Baliga asked Mr. Frame to clarify the method used by the City of
Chicago to identify individuals affiliated with the program. Mr. Frame replied that
everyone working with the Residential Sound Insulation Program has been
issued a very specific photo identification card and must have that card at all
times when on homeowner property. Anyone without the proper identification is
not allowed on site.
NEW BUSINESS
Chairman Baliga asked if there were any further questions or new business requiring
further discussion. With none, a motion to adjourn was made by Ms. Dulaj and
seconded by Mr. Pannaralla. The motion passed.
