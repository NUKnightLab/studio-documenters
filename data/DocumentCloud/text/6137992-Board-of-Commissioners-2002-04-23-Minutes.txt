Whereas, the events of September I I, 2001 have focused attention on the need to have current, accurate
and complete criminal justice information available to assist law enforcement agencies in the delivery of
critical public safety services; and
Whereas, the Circuit Court of Cook County processes more than 70% of the criminal cases in Illinoi s; and
Whereas, improving the qua lity, accuracy, accessibility and timeliness of criminal history information
which is generated, updated, managed and disseminated by Cook County criminal justice agencies, will
enhance the overall quality of criminal history information for Illinois; and
Whereas, the Clerk of the Circuit Court has the responsibility to certify and maintain court records as an
integral component of criminal hi story information, to disseminate criminal case di spositions to the
central state information repository, and to provide access to Cook County criminal case history records
to public safety and criminal justice agencies for critical day-to-day decis ion making; and

1633

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 23, 2002

Whereas, criminal justice information systems in Cook County have been designed to meet agencyspecific operational needs as autonomous and independent systems, and as such, the information can not
be readi ly shared with the courts or other justice agencies and inevitably contains redundancy and
inconsistency with other information in the system; and
Whereas, justice information in Cook County must be improved if we are to provide high quality,
accurate and timely criminal history information to law enforcement officers and the courts for purposes
of making criminal justice decis ions; and
Whereas. judges. prosecutors and police require compl ete and accurate informati on when making arrest,
bail, charging, plea negotiation and sentencing decisions; and

Whereas, j1:1clges, prosee1:1tors aRcl poliee often clo Rot knew if they ha'>'e eemplete iRf.ormatioR when
making bail aRcl senteReiRg cleeisions, eharging cleeisiens, possible plea negotiations ancl arrest cleeisions;
aAd
Whereas, an integrated, county-wide justice information system is necessary to ensure that all public,
private and individual stakeholders in the justice system have the accurate, timely and easily accessible
information they require to better admi nister justice and enhance the safety and well being of the people
of Cook County; and
Whereas, the development of a strategic plan for an integrated criminal justice information system for
Cook County that aligns with and supports the statewide integrated justice information plan, wi ll ensure
that the requirements for Cook County are identified, increasing the effectiveness and applicability of the
statewide plan to the needs of justice agencies within Cook County; and
Whereas, a crucial step in the process of realizing an integrated criminal justice information system for
Cook County is to have a planning body comprised of all the major stakeholders to guide the
development of the strategic plan.
Now, therefore, be it resolved, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that a Cook County
Integrated Criminal Justice Information System Committee be established and charged with preparing a
plan for the development of an integrated crim inal justice information system as follows:

Resolution to the General Assembly to
Amend the C hild Labor Law
Providing Relief for Youth Officials, Umpires and Referees

and provides guidel ines for the employment of youth under the age of 14; and

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR A PRI L 23, 2002

Whereas, the Law was designed to protect children from the dangers of ind ustrial employment and the
perils of adults taking advantage of a superior positio n in the workplace; and
Whereas, the Law has been admirably and diligently enforced by the lllinois Department of Labor; and
Whereas, from time to time laws must be reviewed to determine their app licability and relevance to
contemporary life; and
Whereas, the Labor Department has interpreted that little leagues and other youth athletic programs
cannot utilize the services of boys and gi rls under the age of 14 in these programs with compensation; and
Whereas, youth officials, referees and umpires play an important role in the adm inistration of these
s ports programs for yo uths; and
Whereas, these programs play an impo rtant role in providing recreation programs for child ren; and
Whereas, the opportunity to be paid for participat ing in these programs serves as an important
deve lopment tool for young boys and gi rls in teaching responsibil ity, deve loping a work ethic, enhancing
community participati on and instilling leadership skills in these youths.
Now, Therefore, Be It Resolved, that the President and the Board of Comm issioners of Cook County
does hereby promulgate a review of the Law and amendments to same that would exempt government
affi liated recreati on programs, yo uth clubs and other not-for-profit organ izati ons from the statutory
provisio ns prohibiting minors ages 12 and 13 from serving as paid officials, referees, umpires and other
related positions in youth sport leagues and programs; and
Be It Further Resolved, that the members of the General Assembly are urged to enact statutory
amendments to the Law to provide such relief.
Approved and adopted this 23rd day of April 2002.
