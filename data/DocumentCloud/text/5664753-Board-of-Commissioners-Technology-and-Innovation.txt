NOTICE AND AGENDA

cFive Solutions, Inc. will provide the Juvenile Probation Case Management Module that will replace the
Juvenile Probation Department's Juvenile Enterprise Management System (JEMS) that resides on the
County's AS/400 and managed by Ensono (formerly Axiom). The County is seeking to end the AS/400
contract by April of 2019 that requires the Juvenile Probation and Court Services Department to migrate
to a new windows based system.
This amendment will create a single, unified, probation case
management system for Cook County.
The contract was awarded through the Request for Proposal (RFP) process in accordance with the Cook
County Procurement Code. cFive Solutions, Inc. was selected based on the established evaluation criteria.
