WHEREAS, Members of Congress a re attempting to introduce the O ' Ha re expansion agreeme nt to
esta blis h the agreement as federa l law; and
WHEREAS, if introduced as a federal law the O ' Hare Airpo11 expansion agreement would not be subject
to public hearings and examination; and
WHEREAS, the proposed expansion of O ' Hare Airport wi ll disp lace hundreds, if not thousands of
res idents from the suburbs around O ' Hare, both directly by construction and ind irectly through furth er
flight fro m the no ise of the a irport; a nd
WHEREAS, the expans ion will increase air traffic around an airport that is already the world 's bus iest,
disturbing ma ny more suburban reside nts around O ' Hare; and

841

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 21, 2002

WHEREAS, the proposed expansion will create additional noise and congesti on for the suburbs in and
around O ' Hare; and
WHEREAS, the Suburban O' Hare Comm ission, an organization made up of people and organizations
most effected by O ' Hare Airport, released it's own plan to increase capacity at O ' Hare without displac ing
those around the airport and at a lower cost; and
WHEREAS, even though the agreement does allow a starter airport for the southern suburbs, this airport
will be overshadowed by the even la rger O ' Hare Airport; and
WHEREAS, south suburban res idents wi ll be forced to contend with an ever increasing amount of travel
time to and from O'Hare and even Midway Airports; and
WHEREAS, the need for an airport and any economic development is greatest within southern Cook
County; a nd
WHEREAS, the burden and benefits of economic development from an airport should be balanced
across Cook County and not concentrated in one area.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners urges the
Congress of the United States of America to oppose the proposed expansion o f O' Hare Ai rport and
instead to support an airport for the southern suburbs to a llow economic development in all of Cook
County; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a suitable copy of this Resolution be sent to Members of the
United States Congress representing Cook County.

Commissioner Hansen, seconded by Commissioner Daley, moved to suspend the rules so that this matter

Submitted a Proposed Resolution sponsored by
WILLIAM R. MORAN, County Commiss ioner
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, the prov1s1on of public services including po lice, fire, sanitation, public health, public
education, public works and administrative services are vital to the continued well being of the citizens of
counties as a whole; and
WHEREAS, elected officials and public employers throughout the United States have always sought
ways to minimize the cost and maximize the delivery of public services; and

842

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 2 1, 2002
WHEREAS, proponents of privatization of public serv ices are often shortsighted when they seek to

minimize the cost to the public of providing these services using lower paid, less experienced workers
while at the same time seeking to maximize profits to the contractor; and
WHEREAS, credible research on previous experiments to privatize government services has
demonstrated that the delivery of these services has suffered as a result; and
WHEREAS, privatization has not been shown to benefit the public in the delivery of qua lity services;

and
WHEREAS, privatization has led to public services being perfonned by non-unionized, lower paid and

less experienced workers; and
WHEREAS, privatization experiments are in most cases a weakly concealed attempt to undermine public
sector unionism; and
WHEREAS, public sector unions are committed to providing public services with the public good as the
overriding motive as opposed to the profit motive: and
WHEREAS, privatization experiments represent a deep change in public po licy by taking control of

public po licy by taking control of public services out of the hands of democratically elected governments
and placing it in the hands of profit driven business establishments; and
WHEREAS, companies and businesses that seek contracts for the privatization of government services
are motivated in large part by profits; and
WHEREAS, owners and shareholders of privatization companies and businesses seek to reap the benefit

of providing government services at the expense of the citizens of our counties; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Comm issioners believe in the cost efficient delivery of public
services where workers are appropriately compensated for their personal contribution to the public good;
and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners be lieve that collective bargaining is the best and

most just way to fai rly deal with the needs of public sector workers and the cost efficient provision of
public services; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners believe that the government' s ro le in providing

public services is antithetical to the motives of business entities, which are loyal to owners and
shareholders, and not the public good.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President of the Cook County Board and the Board
of Commiss ioners condemn the continued attempts of government entities throughout the United States to
subvert the co llective bargaining process by their continued attempt to privatize government services.

Commi ssioner Hansen, seconded by Com missioner Daley , moved to suspend the rules so that this matter
may be considered. The motion carried unanimously.
Comm issioner Moran moved that the Proposed Resolution be referred to the Committee on Personnel

University School of Law, Chicago, Illino is, to provide for the continuation of service to the court's
Juvenile Court Clinic pilot program by the Clinical Evaluation and Services Initiative (CES I).
Reason:

CES I is a collaboration of the Children and Fam ily Justice Center of Northwestern University
School of Law Legal C linic and the John D. and Catheri ne T. MacArthur Foundation.
Northwestern Un ive rsity School of Law is the fisca l and ad min istrative agent for CESI.

864

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 21 , 2002

The creation ofa Ju venile Court C linic came a bout as a result of a study commissioned by the
court in 1995 and released in 1999. T his study evaluated the system that provides clinical
info rmation to judges in juvenile court fo r abuse and neglect and delinquency cases. The
resulting re port recommended that the clinic be comprised of four separate but interdependent
units, the Ed ucation and Interve ntion Resource Unit, the Program Evaluat ion Unit, the
C linical Coordination Unit and the Administrative Un it.
In February 2000, the court issued a Request for Proposal (RFP) for two of the Juvenile Court
C linic units, the Clinical Coordination Unit and the Administrati ve Unit. The court supported
the report's recomme ndation that CES I wo uld design and implement the Juvenile Court
C linic's two remaining units, the Education and Interventio n Resource Unit and the Program
Evaluation U nit.
Wh ile the RFP process was underway, a contract was initiated in June 2000 with
Northwestern Unive rsity School of Law to develop and implement all four units of the
Juvenile Court C linic on a limited bas is as a pilot project pe nding the completion of a RFP.
The Juven ile Court C lin ic pilot is c urrently operating in nine (9) of the twe nty-eight (28)
Juvenile Justice and C hild Protection Division courtrooms.
A total of fifty-five (55) ve ndors were invited to submit proposa ls, of which two (2) vendors
responded with proposa ls. After a review of the proposals, the comt has determined that the
cost of the Juvenile Court C linic exceeds the amount original ly projected in fiscal year 2000.
Therefore, this request is for the continuation of the pilot program with Northwestern
utilizing funds appropriated for the program while the court reassesses the configuration of
the proposed clinic.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: $810,000.00. Contract period:
(3 12-260 Account). Requisition No. 23 120002.

Co-Underwriter's Counsel: A ltheimer & Gray and Will iam T uggle; and Trustee: Amalgamated Bank of
Chicago.
Mr. G laser stated the bond issue is broken down into three series . Series A is led by Jac kson Securities,
the Co-Senior: George K. Baum & Company; Co-Managers: Lehman Brothers, Inc. and Podesta &
Company. Series Bis led by William Blair & Company and SBK Brooks Investments. Series C is led by
LaSalle Capital Markets, Salomo n Smith Barney, Inc., Loop Capital Markets, Banc One Capital Markets,
S iebert, Brandford, Shank & Company, and Apex Securities.
Mr. G laser stated the Series A transaction wi ll be done on a taxable basis, on variable rate bonds that wi ll
be used to support the county ' s self- insurance liabilities. The Series B transaction wi ll be a tax-exempt
variable rate issue that will be used to fund the county 's capital improveme nt and capital equ ipment
purchases that the Board has a lready approved. Finally, the Series C transaction wi ll be a fixed rate issue
of approxi mate ly $200 million that wi ll be used to suppo rt capital projects and capital equipm ent
purchases previously approved by the Board.
Mr. G laser stated the county is being adv ised that this is a good time to be in the market. C urrently there
is a shortage of supply of hig h quality tax-exempt paper in the market. Further, Mr. G laser stated that
there are also some large issues coming from the C ity of Chicago, the Metropo litan Water Reclamation
District and the State of Ill inois, and the county would like to be out in front of that so that the county is
not being crowded out by other local Illinois paper in the market.
C hairman Daley announced that a number of ind iv iduals have registered to testify in reference to an issue
relating to the Domestic V io le nce Court. Chairman Daley asked Mr. G laser to address how much money
is a llocated fo r the new Domestic Violence Court?

897

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 21 , 2002

Mr. G laser stated when the county closed on the Series 200 I issue approximate ly a year ago at this time,
$ 16 million was earmarked to address countywide courtroom improvements. Part of that included the
development of a Traffic/ Domestic Vio le nce Court facility on the west side. That project has spent
approximately $ 13 million, in total, on the west side courthouse, and Mr. Glaser believes almost $7
million of that was spent in 200 I. He stated that there are a pproximate ly $2 million of unspent proceeds
that are available to address a new domestic vio lence courtroom should a project come forward. Mr.
Glaser further stated that as pa rt of this bond issue there wil l be additional dollars allocated to countywide
courtroom projects. The appropriation that the Board has passed was approximately $47 million. In the
2002 budget there was another $25 million appropriated, bring ing the total appropriation to approximately
$60 million. Mr. Glaser stated the county has not fully funded that, and it is done in pieces to comply
with Internal Revenue Code spend-down requirements.
Commiss ioner Qui gley commented that under Mr. Glaser's leadership the County's bond issues have
been handled and structured appropriately. He asked Mr. Glaser how the county is spending these funds.
Mr. G laser responded that the Board determines the county 's capital spending authority each year as part
of the annual budget process, but the a llocation of funds to meet that spending authority may not occur
until the re is a subsequent bond issue.
Commissioner Quigley asked for clarification with regard to how much of $47 million in spending
authority fo r a Traffic/ Domestic Violence courthouse was previous ly funded.
President Stroger responded by emphas izing his commitment to construction of a new Domestic Violence
Court fac ility. He is deeply concerned about ove rcrowding in the present faci lity, but he needs the
cooperation of the court's leade rship in order to move forward with plans for a new building. His staff is
wo rking closely with the C hief Judge to dete rmine the number of courtrooms that wi ll be needed.
Chairman Da ley asked Chief Judge T imothy Evans to address the Commissio ne rs in regards to the
Domestic Violence Courthouse.
C hief Judge Evans stated that he is very pleased to be working with the Commiss ioners and Pres ident
Stroger to make certain that the county will have the kind of domestic vio lence faci lity that the citizens of
this county deserve. He stated that the county is interested in a courthouse that is centrally located and
with good public transportation; one that separates the victims from the alleged perpetrators. Also, a
. fac ility that can provide space for the advocacy groups that come in to stand with the victims; provide
space fo r the State' s Attorney ' s office, the Public Defender' s office; and for the lawyers involved. It
should also have security for the citizens and provide space for those who have been convicted of
activities to be housed secure ly while they are there. Finally, Judge Evans stated that these are all things
that they are working on with President Stroger.
Commiss io ner Stee le stated that she hopes that the plan includes space for the children, so they will be
cared fo r while waiting for the ir parents .
Judge Evans stated that the fac ility would have a separate area fo r the children so that they are not
exposed to what is going on in the courtroom.
Commiss ioner Quig ley asked of the $47-$69 millio n targeted initially for this project, how much has been
spent?
Mr. G laser directed Commiss ioner Quigley to a letter that he had sent to C hainnan Daley dated February
20, 2002 .. (The refere nced documents are on file w ith the Office of the County Clerk.)

898

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 21 , 2002

Commissioner Quig ley stated that he did not have a copy, but Mr. G laser should go ahead with his
response.
Mr. G laser referenced bond series issue number 37000, near the bottom of the page of Attachment # I. Of
the $47 million that was appro priated, the county funded $ 16 million of that in the 2001 bond issue to
address the combined Traffic/ Do mestic Viole nce Court. He also stated that on countywide projects,
inc luding that project, the county spent about $ 14.5 million. Of the $ 14.5 million, Mr. Glaser noted at
least $4 million of that has been spent on the combined Traffic/ Domestic Violence Court. Mr. G laser
furth er explained the project that was on the table a year ago, that the Board had approved, the county
spent about $4 million in moving that forward, in land acquisition, consultants and arch itects.
Commissioner Quigley asked if the re is e nough money at this time to build or renovate a building for the
Domestic Violence Court?
Mr. G laser stated that if a project was brought forward today, the county wo uld look at the cash flows that
wou ld be required to support that project; primarily in the next two years, and we wo uld a llocate some of
the money that is identified for future county courtroom projects, and it would be inc luded in there.
Commissioner Quigley asked if there is sufficient money that was left over from last year to do this?
Mr. Glaser stated that the Office of Capital Planning and Policy indicates that they ex pect to spend about
$2 million in the new Domestic Violence Court to bring a plan forward , and there is $2 million available
today to move that project forward.
Commissioner Quigley asked in the last year s ince the initial bond issue and the decision was made not to
build a Traffic Court on the west side, what has been done to move the Domestic Violence Court project
forward?
Chairman Da ley as ked Mr. LaMo nt if he had looked at a number of options under the direction of the
Pres ident, and if he had done so w ithin the period of time that Commissione r Q uig ley is talking about.
Mic hael LaMont stated that in the past year the Office o f Capital Planning and Po licy has done some
initia l investigations of pote ntial sites where a courthouse cou ld be developed or where an addition to ·an
ex isting fac ility could be built. He stated that they have looked at the Daley Center, Juvenile Court
Complex, 26th and California and also at other s ites in the outer Loop area where there might be a
building for sale. This was done for the purpose of know ing what the county's options could be once the
program is established. It is his understanding that within a couple of weeks the Chief Judge's office will
present a draft of what they be lieve they need in terms of the number of courtroom s and s upport space.
Chairman Daley asked if the Office of Capital Planning a nd Po licy has considered gutting the present
building, and relocating them temporarily?
Mr. LaMont responded the re are two reasons why it was never contemplated: first, it would still be
necessary to find a lte rnati ve space, and second ly and more importantly, that building, physically, does not
le nd itse lf to a modern, efficient courthouse w ith the size of the courtrooms and the separations.
Commissioner Collins asked why was n' t the Domestic Violence Court included in the request that is
before the Committee today?

899

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUA RY 21, 2002

Mr. Glaser stated that today there is no domestic violence project to be financed. That project needs to be
deve loped and presented to the Board . Mr. Glaser further stated there was a proj ect approved fo r a
traffic/domestic violence court facility by the Board. Bond proceeds were provided to move that project
forward , as well as other countywide courtroom renovations. Those proceeds have been spent, in those
broadly defined topics, over the past year. In order to bring new proceeds for a domestic violence
courtroom spec ific, he would need a project in order to understand what the projected cash flows would
be on that over the next several years. Therefore, it wou ld be pre mature to include those proceeds,
specifically, in this issue until we understand what the project is going to be. However, should a domestic
violence court facility project come forward , we would reallocate some of those proceeds to address what
our cash needs may be until the next bond issue.
Chairman Daley asked Mr. LaMont when he and the C hief Judge can come back before the Board with a
plan?
Mr. LaMont stated that with the input of the C hief Judge and his timeta ble, he believes that within three
months he can come back to the Board with a report that will indicate what the program has
recomme nded, the square footage, the approximate costs, the approximate schedule and a site evaluation
process. Finally, he stated that the Office of Capital Planning and Policy wi II have to take another look at
the sites, but he fee ls confident that he can come back to the Board in about three months with a report.
Chairman Daley asked Mr. La Mont if he will be meeting with the domestic vio lence advocacy groups and
other interested parties on the proj ect?
Mr. LaMont responded in the affi rmative.
Commissioner Hansen stated that when the county starts construction you do not normally bond right
away, short-term funds are used. He stated that one of the reasons for that is that yo u can issue bonds
on ly on something that is expended within a g iven period of time, or you will pay penalties to the federal
government if it is a tax-exempt security. Further he stated that the financing should be handled very
carefully or the county will start pay ing penalties on it.
Commissioner Sutker asked if the Daley Center and 69 West Washington are being considered as
possible s ites for the new Domestic Violence Court, since there already is a child day-care center at 69
West Washington?
Mr. LaMont responded prior to purchas ing the 69 West Washington bu ilding in 1996, the Pres ident,
former Chief Judge O'Connell, and others walked the building to see if that building would le nd itself to
courtrooms. At that time it was determined, based on the former C hief Judge's recommendati on, that
building in particular is not suited for courtrooms. With respect to the Daley Center, which is a
courthouse, essentially, there is no available space in the Daley Center at the present ti me. Mr. LaMont
also stated that the Daley Center does not have adequate lockup facilities fo r the additional detainees.
Commissioner Sutker stated that he would like for Mr. La Mont to revis it the combination of the 69 West
Washington Building and the Daley Center with respect to the Domestic Violence Court.
Commissioner Lechowicz refere nced the meeting he had with Mr. G laser with respect to this bond issue.
During the course of the meeting, Commiss ione r Lechowicz asked fo r a breakdown of the expend itures
by project. Commissioner Lechowicz proceeded to summarize the expenditures for fi scal years 2002 and
2003. Based on the breakdown, Commiss ione r Lechowicz inquired as to whether or not the Domestic
Violence facility is included. Commissioner Lechowicz was informed that matter was not before the
Committee at the present time.

900

 JOURNAL OF PROCEED TNGS FOR FEBRUA RY 2 1, 2002

Commissioner Lechowicz stated that he is concerned abo ut the time de lay for the Domestic Violence
Court proj ect and also the issues raised by the gro ups and some of the Commiss ioners. Commiss ioner
Lechowicz stressed the importance of a coordinated effort by all parties in moving this project forward.
Commissioner Lechowicz further stated that the County Board has not increased the tax levy s ince 1996.
He asked if a n increase in the rea l estate taxes w ill be req uired? Comm issio ner Lechowicz asked Mr.
G laser to respond to his concerns.
Mr. G laser stated that since 1996 the county has issued almost $1. 1 billion of bonds to support capital
proj ects, whic h has been done without an inc rease in the property tax levy. He further stated that as the
county issues add itiona l bonds, the fl ex ibility in be ing able to keep that levy constant, is going to be a
cha llenge. Mr. G laser stated that he w ill not commit today that this bond issue is goin g to req uire a
property tax increase.
With respect to Series A ($100 million self-insurance - taxable), Commissioner Lechowicz as ked Mr.
G laser how many cases are curre ntly in the pipe line, a nd would this amount be sufficient to cover the
county's exposure?
Mr. G lase r responded the county pays a pprox imately $50 million a year in total settlements and that
should carry the coun ty for a coup le of years before we would need to appropriate new monies fro m the
o perating budget to inc rease the fund.
Comm iss ioner Lechowicz disputed that the amount would be suffi cient, as he has been info rmed there are
two cases forthcom ing which could expend half of the amount. Commissioner Lechowicz d id not have
any questions with respect to Series B and Series C. However, Commissioner Lechowicz re iterated his
concern that there is go ing to be a real estate tax increase, perha ps in 2005.
Commiss ioner Silvestri noted that when the Board decided to not bui ld the Traffic Court/Domest ic
Violence Cou1t on the west side, the Board actual ly saved the taxpayers a lot of money as a result of the
relocation of the Traffic Court into an existing fac ility built as a courtho use, the Daley Center.
Commissioner Silvestri expressed h is support of Commissioner Sutker's point of looking at the Da ley
Center again. Commissioner S ilvestri stated that most of the people that are here today just wa nt to know
w hen the new Domestic Violence Court w ill be built, they are not interested in the bond issue. He
conc luded by stating the Board 's comm itment in mov ing this project forward and bu ilding a dom est ic
v iolence court fac ility.
Commissioner Sims stated that the county needs a backup plan, in the event we encounter the same type
of opposition as was evidenced w hen the west s ide court fac ility was introduced.
Commissioner Gos li n stated that his concern is that the county should look at all of the options . T here
could be industrial build ings that may fit the county's needs that can be retrofitted. Further, he stated that
he would li ke to see the county do the same thi ng w hen a ll of the specifications are o ut there, that the
county evaluate the market for whatever type of space is available, not just vacant space, but whatever
type of space that the coun ty can fi nd that wil l be appropriate for all of the othe r parameters that have
already been established.
Commissioner Schuma nn stated that he a ppreciates the renewed sense of urgency on this p lan a nd that the
county is moving forward o n the project.

90 1

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 21 , 2002

Commissioner Mo reno commented that no one disputes that the domestic vio lence courthouse is at the
forefront of the most important things the Board needs to act on. The Board is the fiscal money manager
for the taxpaye rs and as such has a duty to prioritize the things that our county needs, both socially and in
government.
Commissione r Sutker asked Judge Evans if the Daley Center and 69 West Washington, or a combination
of both are being excluded as a site for the Domestic Violence Court?
Judge Evans responded that he had given the genera l outline of what he thinks is needed and has not in
any way suggested what site should be considered. Further, he stated that he wi ll wait until something is
recommended to him and at that time we w ill look at the recommended s ites.
President Stroger commented that he and others investigated the 69 West Washington Bui lding. The
ceilings are very low, and there were many other phys ical things that prevent it from being fo und
adequate for court facil ities. Further, the President stated that Judge Evans wi ll work with Mr. LaMont
and all of the officials to see that the county will get an adequate s ite. Judge Evans will also he lp des ign
the plans for the Domestic Violence Court project.
President Stroger concluded his remarks by noti ng that on February 15, he along with Ruth Rothstein and
Michael LaMont accepted the keys of completion from Walsh Construction fo r the new Cook County
Hospital. President Stroger stated the building has been completed accord ing to the specifications, and
the City of C hicago has completed their inspection.
Commiss ioner Hansen asked Mr. G laser if there is a breakdown which adds up all of the figures
referenced in letters dated February 15 and February 20. He also asked what mode of bond the county is
applyi ng to each of the categories?
Mr. G laser responded that traditiona lly, when he comes to the Board to ask fo r approval, he asks fo r a
maximum amount. That does not mean that the county wou ld issue $600 million. He stated that in order
to meet the proceeds that we need of $487 million, the county would issue approximately $575 million.
Commissioner Hansen stated that those figures still don' t add up to the $600 million.
Mr. G laser stated that the Com missioner was correct, the figure of $600 million was a maximum cei ling,
not a final sum of what will be funded.
Comm issione r Hansen asked what is the amount the county is planning to a uthori ze by next week fo r the
bonds?
Mr. Glaser stated that he expects to be in the market sometime next week.
Commissione r Hansen wanted to know on what amount.
Mr. Glaser stated that for the fixed rate piece, approximately $23 5 million. Subsequent to that, with in a
two-week period, the county wou ld expect to be in the market for approx imately $120 million of taxable
variable rate bonds, and approximate ly $225 million of tax-exempt variable rate bonds.
Commiss ioner Hansen asked Mr. G laser to provide expected go-to-market dates.
Commissione r Hansen asked Mr. G laser how much the County has already authorized or issued w ith
respect to Cook County Hos pital.

902

 JO URNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUA RY 2 1, 2002

Mr. Glaser explained that going back as early as 1996, the county began to issue bonds for the
construction of the new Cook County Hospital. Mr. G laser stated oftlrnnd approximately $375 million of
prior bond issues have gone to he lp build the new Cook Co unty Hospital. Jn the letter dated February 15
to Chairman Daley, $ 157 million is to be spent in the current fiscal year and approx imately $27 million in
2003.
Commissione r Hansen asked what is the length of time that is being issued for the securities?
Mr. G laser stated it wi ll differ by series. He stated the fixed rate deal wi ll be approximately twenty to
twenty-two years. He believes the variable rate bonds on both the tax-exe mpt a nd the taxables w ill have
an average Iife of about twelve to thirteen years.
Commissioner Hansen asked Mr. G laser to provide a table showing the present value of the dollar interest
over the period fo r this issue, fo r everything combined.
Commissioner Hansen asked w hat is the expected interest rate on the present value of the dollar?
Mr. Glaser stated a pprox imately I Yi percent.
Commissioner Ha nsen asked how does the indebtedness leve l compare with other maj or county levels?
Mr. Glaser stated that the net direct debt per capita will put Cook County on par with Los Angeles
County, and it wou ld put Cook County higher than Harris County, Texas. Mr. G laser stated that he
would conside r those two the closet peers because they have both a public health and public safety
component to the ir operations, like Cook County. Mr. G laser s pecu lated that Harris County, T exas, will
look very differe nt in the next severa l years because of the growth that is taking place will require
additiona l bonds to support that infrastructure. He thinks the rating agenc ies w ill conclude that Cook
County has a moderate level of overall debt.

On or prior to any redemption date, the County sha ll deposit with the Trustee an amount of
money sufficient to pay the redemption price of all the Bonds or portions of Bonds which are to be
redeemed on that date.
Notice of redemption having been g iven as provided therefor, the Bonds or portio ns of Bonds so
to be redeemed shall, on the redemption date, become due and payable at the redemption price therein
specified, and from and after such date (unless the County shall default in the payment of the redemption
price) such Bonds or portions of Bonds s hall cease to bear interest. Neither the fa ilure to mail such
redemption notice nor any defect in any notice so mailed to any particular reg istered owner of a Bond
shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other registered owners. Notice having been
properly given, failure of a registe red owner of a Bond to receive such notice shall not be deemed to
invalidate, limit or delay the effect of the notice or the redemption action described in the notice. Such
notice may be waived in writing by a registered owner of a Bond, either before or after the event, and
such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice sha ll be filed with the Trustee, but
s uch filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such
waiver. Upon surrender of such Bonds for redemption in accordance with said notice, such Bonds shall
be paid by the Trustee at the redemption price. Interest due on or prior to the redemption date shall be
payable as herein provided for payment of interest. Upon surrender fo r any partial redemption of any
Bond, there shall be prepared fo r the registered owner a new Bond or Bonds of the same Stated Maturity
in the amount of the unpaid principal or Maturity Amount.
With respect to any redemption of Bonds, unless moneys sufficient to pay the redemption price of
the Bonds to be redeemed shall have been received by the Trustee prior to the g iv ing of the notice of
redemption, such notice may, at the option of the County, state that such redemption shall be conditional
upon the receipt of such moneys by the Trustee on or prior to the date fixed for redemption. If such
moneys are not received, such notice shall be of no force and effect, the Trustee shall not redeem such
Bonds, and the Trustee shall give notice, in the same manner in which the notice of redemption shall have
been given, that such moneys were not so rece ived and that such Bonds will not be redeemed.
If any Bond or portion of Bond called for redemptio n shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof
for redemption, in the case of Current Interest Bonds, the principal shall, until paid, bear interest from the
redemption date at the rate borne by the Bond or portion of Bond so called for redemption; in the case of
Variable Rate Bonds, the princ ipal shall, until paid, bear interest as provided in a relevant Indenture; and,
in the case of Capital Appreciation Bonds, the Compound Accreted Value at such redemption date shall
continue to accrue interest from such redemptio n date at the Yield to Maturity borne by such Capital
Appreciation Bond, or po11ion thereof, so called for redemption. All Bonds which have been redeemed
shall be cancelled and destroyed by the Trustee and shall not be reissued.

The County shall cause the Bond Register to be kept at the principal corporate trust office of the
Trustee, which is hereby constituted and appointed the Registrar of the County. The County is authorized
to prepare, and the Trustee shall keep custody of, multiple Bond blanks executed by the County for use in
the transfer and exchange of Bonds.
Subject to the provisions hereof relating to the Bonds in Book Entry Form, upon surrender for
transfer of any Bond at the principal corporate trust office of the T rustee, duly endorsed by, or
accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to the Trustee and
duly executed by, the registered owner or his or her attorney duly authorized in writing, the County shall
execute and the Trustee shall authenticate, date and deliver in the name of the transferee or transferees (a)
in the case of any Capital Appreciation Bond, a new fully registered Capital Appreciation Bond or Bonds
of the same series and of the same Stated Maturity of Authorized Denominations, for a like aggregate
Original Principal Amount or (b) in the case of any C urrent Interest Bond or Variable Rate Bond, a new
fully reg istered Bond or Bonds of the same tenor, of the same inte rest rate and Stated Maturity, of
Authorized Denominations, for a like aggregate principal amount. Subject to the provisions of this
Ordinance relating to Book Entry Form any Capital Appreciation Bond or Bonds may be exchanged at
said office of the Trustee or its proper agent for a like aggregate Original Principal Amount of Capital
Appreciation Bond or Bonds of the same maturity of other Authorized Denominations; and any fully
registered Current Interest Bond or Bonds or Variable Rate Bond or Bonds may be exchanged at said
office of the Trustee or its proper agent for a like aggregate principal amo unt of such Bonds of the same
tenor, of the same interest rate and Stated Maturity, of other Authorized Denominations.
The execution by the County of any fully registered Bond shall constitute full and due
authorization of such Bond, and the Trustee or its prope r agent shall thereby be authorized to
authenticate, date and deliver such Bond in accordance with the terms of th is Ordi nance and of any
Indenture.
The person in whose name any Bond shall be registered shal l be deemed and regarded as the
absolute owner thereof for all purposes, and payment of the principal o f, premium (if any) or interest on
or any Maturity Amount of a ny Bond shall be made only to or upon the order of the registered owner
thereof or his or her legal representative. All such payments sha ll be va lid and effectual to satisfy and
discharge the liability upon such Bond to the extent of the sum or s ums so paid.
No service charge shall be made for any transfer or exchange of Bonds, but the County or the
Trustee may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or othe r governmental charge that may
be imposed in connection with any transfer or exchange of Bonds exchanged in the case of the issuance of
a Bond or Bonds for the outstanding portion of a Bond surrendered for redemption.
If any Bond, whether in temporary or definitive form , is lost (whether by reason of theft or
otherwise), destroyed (whether by mutilation, damage, in whole or in part, or otherwise) or improperly
cancelled, the Trustee or its proper agent may authenticate a new Bond of like date, maturity date, interest
rate (or, in the case of Capital Appreciation Bonds, Yield to Maturity), denomination and Original
Principal Amount (in the case of Capital Appreciation Bonds) or principal amount (i n the case of other
Bonds) and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding; provided that (a) in the case of any

917

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 21 , 2002

mutilated Bond, such mutilated Bond shall first be surrendered to the Trustee, and (b) in the case of any
lost Bond or Bond destroyed in whole, there shall be first furnished to the Trustee evidence of such loss
or destruction, together with indemnification of the County and the Trustee, satisfactory to the Trustee. In
the event any lost, destroyed or improperly cancelled Bond shall have matured or is about to mature, or
has been called for redemptio n, instead of issuing a duplicate Bond, the Trustee shall pay the same
without surrender thereof if there shall be first furnished to the Trustee evidence of such loss, destruction
or cancellation, together with indemnity, satisfactory to it. Upon the issuance of any substitute Bond, the
Trustee may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmenta l charge that
may be imposed in relation thereto.

 JOURNA L OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 21, 2002

w ith SOODAN AND ASSOC IATES, INC. in the amount of $3 ,000,000.00 for the Countyw ide Building Exterior Inspection and Stabi lization Project, Phase I. It is respectfully requested
that this honorable body approve this request.
Phase I services inc lude three years of annual v isua l and critical exterior wal l and enc losure
inspections based upon required C ity and Municipal Codes. The inspectio ns will determine the
conditi on of the facades and detailed reports wi ll be prepared and submitted to the County and
the City. Approximately 60 buildings wi ll be inspected.
Phase II services w ill include the preparation of contract documents fo r the necessary
stabilization of the building facades. These services will be negotiated upon complet ion of
Phase I.
Estim ated Fisca l Impact: $3,000,000.00. Bond Issue (20000 Account).
Suffic ient funds have been a ppropriated to cover thi s request.

*Referred to the Construction Committee on 02/07/02.
Michael LaMont asked a representative from Soodan & Associates to g ive backgro und info rmation on the
C ity o f C hicago and municipa l codes that require building inspections. Mr. LaM ont commented that
during the past year, the C ity of C hicago has made ins pection requirements more stringent.
Dr. Suresh Pinjarkar, Principal/Director of Eng ineering, Soodan & Associates, stated that the ordinance
has been in place s ince 1996 a nd then requ ired a nnual visual and critical exterior wa ll inspections of
buildings. Dr. Pinjarkar furth er stated that a v isua l exam is conducted annua lly of a ll the high-rise
buildings more than e ighty feet in he ight and a re port g iven to the C hicago Building De partme nt. The
Ordinance a lso requi res that a c ritical exam be cond ucted every four years and involves looking at the
building fro m a close vantage po int us ing a sw ing stage and one hundred po ints of the fa9ade to determ ine
any defic ienc ies.
Dr. Pinjarkar stated that because the C ity of C hicago has had serious pro blems regarding fo llow-up
examinations of buildings in the past, the C ity is now de manding that a ll bu ildings erected prior to 1950
be critica lly examined by November I, 2002 a long with a n inspection report. T he Ordinance fu rther
requires that a critical exam be completed w ithin the next four years on buildings e rected afte r I 950.
Dr. Pinjarkar commented that the request before the committee has been di vided into two phases. He said

inspection of the exterior of a ll County owned buildings?

993

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 21 , 2002

Michael LaMont responded that the County is v iewed like any other property owner in the C ity of
Chicago, so the County is required to comply w ith the O rdinance. Mr. LaMont further stated that the
project is being deemed a countywide project because the Office of Capital Planning a nd Policy feels that
buildings located outside of the C ity should also be inspected. He said that these inspections are not
required by municipal statute but will be part of the County's due diligence as a property owne r.
Commissioner Collins asked if any other munic ipality has a similar ordinance?
Michae l La Mont responded that he is unaware of a similar ordinance required by another municipality in
Cook County.
Commissioner Hansen asked why an inspection is being requested fo r the new Cook County
Administration Building?
Michael LaMont said that the repairs to the new Cook County Administration Building were based on an
inspection completed in the year 2000 and repairs and painting of the building's exterior were concluded
last summe r. He said the C ity ' s O rdinance has now changed and requires a nnual v isual inspections in off
years. Director LaMont also said that the fo urth year requires scaffolding and drops a long the entire front
fa9ade of the building.
Comm issioner Hansen asked the C ity ' s rationale for such a short time frame between inspections?
Michae l LaMont stated that he believes the rationale is a result of an increased amo unt offa9ade failure in
olde r buildings around the City.
Dr. Pinjarkar continued, and stated that most concrete patch repairs have a life expecta ncy of no more
than five years.
Comm issioner Hansen asked the life expectancy of a new building?
Dr. Pinjarkar stated the fa9ade on new buildings is designed to last for at least fi fty years.
Commissione r Hansen stated that he is concerned a bout the scaffolding requireme nts in the critica l
inspections of every fo ur years. The commissioner also asked if this point has been raised with the C ity
of C hicago, and if not, could it be raised?
Michael LaMont stated that the County has not raised the question but it can be asked. Mr. LaMont
stated that the scaffolding would protect whatever is below or at ground level; and the C ity does not
require scaffolding over the entire building, it requires only canopy protection.
Commiss ioner Hansen asked if the County or the cons ulta nt is responsible for keeping the inspection
reports?
Dr. Pinjarkar responded that the County keeps the reports.
Comm issioner Hansen asked the approx imate cost of a detailed inspection on a building the size of the
Cook County Administration, if conducted every fo ur years?

994

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 21, 2002

Michael LaMont responded the County will have an ongoing inspection program and dollars will be
allocated in the Five Year Capital Program budget. He said the amount of dollars required to fund the
inspection program is not yet known . He said the cost would be determined once the reports are
completed. An annual evaluation will be made to see if the dollars are correct. Mr. LaMont informed the
committee that the request before the committee is to enter into a three-year contract with Soodan &
Associates.
Commissioner Hansen asked the approximate cost to repair the exterior of the Cook County
Administration Building?
Michael LaMont stated the cost was approximately $2.5 million that also included painting the building's
exterior.
Commissioner Hansen asked the reason why the First District Courthouse is included in the inspection?
Michael LaMont responded that the reference is to the courthouse located at 13 111 Street and Michigan,
which the County did not sell.
Commissioner Hansen stated that he thought the Rockwell Warehouse was completed.
Michael LaMont said that the exterior is currently under repair and should be completed by end of spring.
He said the County does not have a critical inspection report of the building on file and an inspection
should be conducted.
Commissioner Hansen asked if buildings located outside the City of Chicago will be placed on the same
cycle as buildings located within the City?
Michael LaMont responded that the Office of Capital Planning and Policy has not yet made a
determination. He continued to state that initial re ports should be available by summer and all reports
will be brought before the Construction Committee.
Commissioner Hansen asked Mr. LaMont his thoughts regarding the City's inspection program?
Michae l LaMont stated that the requirements may now appear too stringent, but the City of Chicago has
previously allowed some latitude to building owners. He further stated that he would not be surprised
that most building owners will have complied with the Ordinance after the four-year cycle and cause the
City to rethink the requirements because the inspections are very costly.
Commissioner Hansen commented that he thinks the inspection program is excellent.
Commissioner Moreno stated that the cost for the program is $3 million and asked if the program includes
construction costs if problems are found?
Director LaMont responded that the $3 million dollar contract includes approximately $200,000 for
temporary emergency stabilization while the consultants are conducting inspections. He said that In the
event that it is determined that the contract should be increased, the Office of Capital Planning and Policy
will seek authorization.
Commissioner Moreno asked if there have been problems with the County Building in the past?
