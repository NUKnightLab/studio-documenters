held by the Chicago Public Schools in the course of its operations and mission as provided for in the
Public Funds Investment Act 30, 23511 et seq. (the "Investment Act?) and other applicable law.

with all state and local laws governing the investment of public funds and which will meet the following
objectives:

19

December 18, 2013

- Prudence: The standard of prudence to be used shall be the ?prudent person? standard and shall
be applied in the context of managing an overall portfolio. Persons authorized to trade on behalf
of CPS acting in accordance with written procedures, this Investment Policy, and exercising due
diligence shall be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security's credit risk or
market price changes.

Investments shall be made with judgment and care, under circumstances then prevailing, which

not for Speculation, but for investment, considering the probable safety of their capital as well as
the probable income to be derived.

- Safety of Principal: investments of the Chicago Public Schools shall be undertaken in a manner
that provides for the preservation of principal in the overall portfolio.

- Diversi?cation: The Chicago Public Schools shall diversify its investments to avoid incurring
unreasonable risks associated with speci?c securities or ?nancial institutions.

meet all reasonably anticipated Operating and cash ?ow requirements.

- Rate of Return: The inVestment portfolio of the Chicago Public Schools shall be constructed with
the objective of attaining a market rate of return throughout budgetary and economic cycles,
taking into account investment risk constraints and liquidity needs. While return on investment is
of less importance than the safety and liquidity objectives described above, the investment
program may seek to augment returns consistent with risk limitations identi?ed herein and with
prudent investment principles.

- Public Trust: All participants in the investment process shall seek to act responsibly as
custodians of the public trust and shall avoid any transactions that might impair public con?dence
in the Chicago Public Schools.

- Portfolio Management: The Board Recognizes and authorizes the Treasurer to develop
procedures regarding trading practices that it deems appropriate to ?meet the investment
objectives of this Investment Policy. Those procedures shall be presented to and reviewed by the
CPS Investment Committee as appropriate, but at least annually.

Chicago?s approved depository listing.

IV. Ethics and Con?ict of Interest

In addition to all obligations and requirements of the Board?s Ethics Policy, all persons authorized
to trade on behalf of CPS must refrain from personal business activity that could potentially con?ict with
prOper exeCution of this Investment Policy or impair their ability to make impartial decisions. The
Treasurer shall implement an annual attestation to be completed by all personnel authorized to trade
disclosing all personal brokerage relationships. The Treasurer shall collect and review such attestations
and ?le them with the internal audit function.

Under no circumstances shall a participant in the investment process receive any type of ?nancial
gain, either directly or indirectly, from the investment of Chicago Public Schools funds. Any real or
potential con?ict of interest must be reported to the internal audit function and General Counsel.
