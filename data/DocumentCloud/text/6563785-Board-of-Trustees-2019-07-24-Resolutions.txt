request of the institution as a Trustee, Officer, Employee, member, manger, or agent of
another corporation, domestic or foreign, nonprofit or for-profit, limited liability
company, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise; provided such person

However, the institution shall defend and indemnify any such agent (as opposed to any
Trustee, Officer, or Employee) of this institution to an extent greater than that required
by law only if and to the extent that the Trustees may, in their discretion, so determine.
The defense and indemnification provided hereby shall not be deemed exclusive of any
other rights to which those seeking defense and indemnification may be entitled under
any law, the articles of incorporation or any agreement, or otherwise, both as to action
in official capacities and as to action in another capacity while such person is a Trustee,
Officer, Employee or agent of the institution, and shall continue as to a person who has
ceased to be a Trustee, Officer, Employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the
heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.
Expenses incurred in defending any civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding or any
issue therein, including attorneys’ fees, may be paid by the institution in advance of
the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding as authorized by the Board of the
institution in each specific case, upon receipt of an undertaking by the director, officer,
employee, member, manager, agent or volunteer to repay such amounts unless it shall
