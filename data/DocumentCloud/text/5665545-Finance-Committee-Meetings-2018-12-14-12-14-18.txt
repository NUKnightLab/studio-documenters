III. Action Items
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)
With regard to request number 19, Director Richardson-Lowry inquired regarding the contract savings of 2-4%,
as reflected on the transmittal; she said that savings sounds low. Douglas Elwell, Deputy Chief Executive Officer
of Finance and Strategy, responded that this only reflects additional savings over the prior contract, and does not
reflect the total savings. Director Richardson-Lowry requested that information on the total contract savings be
provided to the Committee through the Chair.
During the discussion of request number 22, Chair Reiter inquired whether the administration is making sure that
the vendor is paying their employees within area standards and using local workers to perform the work. Mr.
Jones responded that he will find out and report back to the Committee.
With regard to request number 23, Mr. Jones noted that the request will be amended to a reduced amount of
$1,375,000; further negotiations took place following the issuance of the transmittal, which resulted in the lower
contract amount.
Director Richardson-Lowry, seconded by Chair Reiter, moved the approval of
request numbers 1 through 23, subject to completion of review by Contract
Compliance, where appropriate. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
Chair Reiter noted his comments regarding request number 22; he reminded the
