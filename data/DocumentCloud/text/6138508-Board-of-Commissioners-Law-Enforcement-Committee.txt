 WHEREAS, children are becoming exposed to these technologies and other social media sites at earlier ages
than ever before; and
WHEREAS, the evolving nature of technology and the younger age of its users has made these children more
and more susceptible to exploitation by both adults and each other; and
WHEREAS, “sexting” is commonly known as the transmittal of sexually explicit messages primarily between
mobile phones is prohibited, in some form, throughout the United States; and
WHEREAS, the State of Illinois’ statute on the matter states that a “minor shall not distribute or disseminate an
indecent visual depiction of another minor through the use of a computer or electronic communication device”
(705 ILCS 405/3-40(b)); and
WHEREAS, the penalty for such an act is a misdemeanor, usually requiring court supervision and counseling;
and
WHEREAS, Cook County has a legitimate interest in the protection of the privacy and safety of its minor
residents; and
WHEREAS, under the ‘home rule authority’ granted to Cook County by the constitution of the State of Illinois,
the county may enact a stricter ordinance than exists under the state statute.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners will analyze and review the current
Cook County ordinance and state laws regarding the electronic dissemination of indecent depictions of minors.
