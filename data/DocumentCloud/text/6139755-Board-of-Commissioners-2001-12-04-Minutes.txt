This Amendment amends the Resolution and Annual Appropriation Bill fo r the Fiscal Year 2002 by
creating a new Section 29 relative to Grants, and renumbering Section 29 to Section 30. The County
enters into grant agreements with vari ous providers each year. Some of the grants approved by the Cook
County Board of Commissioners obligate the County to match with funds and/or personnel. Often times,
the County's costs (direct and indirect) increase yearly over the life of the grant. Therefore, a new
requirement of each Department Head, Elected Official or Bureau Chief will be implemented which will
allow the Board of Commissioners to be fully apprised of the grant details prior to any obligation of the
County.
