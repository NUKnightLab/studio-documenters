Preliminary Landmark Recommendation
1810 W. CORTLAND STREET

WARD 32

Brian Goeken reported that on July 22, the Department of Zoning and Land Use Planning
received a permit application for 1810 W. Cortland pursuant to the City's DemolitionDelay Ordinance. As part of the proposed work, the rear 26 feet of the building would be
demolished. The building is color-coded "orange" in the Chicago Historic Resources
Survey. Under the Demolition-Delay Ordinance, the Department may delay issuance of
the permit for up to 90 days in order to explore options to preserve the building, including
possible landmark designation. The Department elected to refer the matter to the
Commission for further review and consideration.
Brian Goeken stated that Historic Preservation staff supports the preservation of 1810 W.
Cortland, but does not believe that the building qualifies for landmark designation under
the Chicago Landmarks Ordinance and is therefore not recommending that the
Commission initiate the consideration process with a preliminary landmark
recommendation; however, should the Commission believe that the building does
preliminarily meet at least two landmark criteria and the integrity criterion, the
Commission could consider approving a preliminary landmark recommendation.
Matt Crawford presented background information on the building, and Brian Goeken
presented the staff recommendation and analysis.

 Alderman Scott Waguespack (32nd Ward) and nine members of the public expressed
support for the designation of the building as a Chicago Landmark. Ron Grace, attorney
for the property owner, expressed support for the staff recommendation against landmark
recommendation.
Following discussion by the Commission, the owner of the building, Raj Fernando, said
that he was not opposed to landmark designation of the building. Mr. Fernando also
indicated that, whether the building was designated or not, he would undertake a full
restoration of the front elevation of the building; and that additionally, all work proposed
to the rear of the building would not be visible from the public-right-of-way and only a
small portion of the work to the rear would be minimally visible from the alley.
A motion was made by the Commission that the building located at 1810 W. Cortland
Street meets at least two criteria for landmark designation set forth in §2-120-620
Municipal Code of Chicago; and that the Building satisfies the historic integrity
requirement set forth in §2-120-630 of the Municipal Code. For the purposes of
§2-120-740 of the Municipal Code governing permit review, the significant historical and
architectural features of the Building be preliminarily identified as:
•

All exterior elevations, including rooflines, of the Building visible from public
rights-of-way.

For purposes of § 2-120-825 of the Municipal Code specifically and only governing
permits for demolition, the significant historical and architectural features of the Building
be preliminarily identified as:
•

All exterior elevations, including rooflines, for a depth of forty (40) feet as
measured from the front elevation. The rear approximately twenty-six (26) feet of
the Building is specifically and purposefully excluded.

Motioned by Wong, seconded by Reed. Approved (7-3).
Chairman Mosena announced that since the Commission voted a preliminary
recommendation for the building, the Commission would consider the pending permit
application #100301990 for 1810 W. Cortland St.
3.

Preliminary Decision on Permit Application
1810 W. CORTLAND STREET

WARD 32

Eleanor Gorski presented the staff report on the proposed rehabilitation, including
an addition connecting the building to adjacent single-family house at 1808 W. Cortland
St., new window openings on east (side) elevation, storefront window changes to meet
ventilation code requirements, and demolition of rear portion of building (rear
approximately 26 feet).
Resolution to accept the staff recommendation on Permit Application #100301990.
Motioned by Ellin, seconded by Baird. Approved unanimously. (10-0)

Report on Demolition Permit Application Preliminarily Disapproved by the
Commission
2127 W. Schiller Avenue (Wicker Park District)

WARD 32

Brian Goeken reported that following the Commission's preliminary denial of a
demolition permit for the building on July 9th, an informal conference pursuant to Sec. 2120-790 of the Chicago Landmarks Ordinance was held with the applicant on July 24th.
Commission member Edward Torrez represented the Commission at the informal
conference. The landmarks ordinance requires that a public hearing be held on the permit
application if no accord has been reached within 30 days of the informal conference. As
announced at the last commission meeting, the applicant subsequently requested and was
granted a 30-day extension of the deadline to conclude the informal conference in order
to continue these discussions with the Commission.
As was noted at the Commission's July meeting, the building was the subject of an active
code enforcement case. The Department of Buildings continued to monitor the
condition of the building, and following its most recent inspection, subsequently
determined and notified the staff to the Commission pursuant to Sec. 2-120-780 of the
Chicago Landmarks Ordinance that the demolition of the building was necessary to
remedy conditions imminent ly dangerous to life, health and/or property. The landmarks
ordinance specifies that in such instances the permit application shall be approved. The
demolition permit was approved by the staff to the Commission on Sept. 18th.

The following projects were reviewed by the PRC:
1.

325 N. LaSalle
(Reid, Murdoch and Co. Building – 42nd Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed enlargement on north elevation of previously approved eighthfloor rooftop addition and additional rooftop deck areas

Action: Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. The conditions of approval from the Committee’s review of the project
on November 1, 2007 remain in effect;
2. The enlarged rooftop addition shall be no higher, nor differently
configured or set back from the perimeter walls any less than
proposed, per submitted elevations and plans dated 8/11/09; The top of
the enlarged eighth-floor rooftop addition shall match the height of the
previously approved rooftop addition and shall be no higher than
133.67’ CCD. After installation of the framing, the applicant shall
provide a surveyor’s report verifying that the addition has been
constructed in accordance with the permit plans and a letter of
certification of same from the applicant. Upon completion of the
project, a surveyor’s report and applicant certification shall similarly
be submitted;
3. As proposed and depicted on proposed elevations dated 8/11/09, the
fenestration design shall be modified from that previously approved by
PRC for both the main rooftop addition and the proposed enlargement,
incorporating smaller glass areas on the west, north, and east
elevations, and larger glass areas on the south elevation; and,

 4. As proposed, the rooftop addition shall be clad with dark gray, nonreflective, rectangular metal panels (Centria 181 Slate Gray).
2.

2320 N. Kedzie
(Logan Square Boulevards District – 35th Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed 1-story masonry rear addition for indoor swimming pool
connecting a previously approved (to be constructed) 2-story masonry rear
addition to existing 3-story masonry single- family residence and a
proposed 3-car masonry garage along alley

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. The conditions of approval from Committee’s review of the project on
June 5th , 2008 (decisio n letter dated 06/11/08) remain in effect;
2. A sample of the additions’ face brick and matching mortar shall be
reviewed and approved by Historic Preservation staff prior to order
and installation; and,
3. The project may require zoning variances by the Zoning Board of
Appeals or administrative adjustments for side yard and rear yard
reductions. The Commission takes no position regarding the merits of
any requested reduced yard requirements.

3.

6240 N. Lundy
(Old Edgebrook District – 41st Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed 2nd-floor rear addition to existing attached garage and rear porch
and stairs

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. As accepted and agreed to by the applicant, cedar shake siding
proposed for the addition shall be painted to match the color of clay
tile roofing and siding existing on the building to further minimize the
addition’s visual impact on the existing roofline;
2. As proposed, replacement windows shall be simulated-divided lite
clad-wood windows to match the arrangement and exterior profiles of
the existing wood windows on the building. Existing and proposed
window details shall be submitted with the permit plans; and,
3. The proposed project requires zoning administrative adjustments for
side and rear yard reductions. The Commission takes no position
regarding reduced yard requirements.

4.

2600 N. Kedzie
(Logan Square Boulevards District – 35th Ward)

 Proposal:

Violation: Replacement without a permit of 172 historic wood windows
with new vinyl windows for an existing 7-story low-income housing
building. Vinyl windows proposed to be modified to match the historic
window configuration, including muntin pattern, removal of vinyl
panning, and installation of new brick molds

Action:

Given the large number of windows, and in acknowledgement that the
building is used for low- income senior housing, the Committee voted
unanimously that the project, based upon the specific conditions and
circumstances of the project—and with the proposed modifications to the
installed windows to more closely match the removed historic windows—
would not have an adverse effect on the significant historical and
architectural features of the landmark district and approved the project
with the following condition, subject to review and approval of Historic
Preservation staff:
1. Full-scale existing and proposed window dimensioned details
shall be submitted with the permit application. The details shall
clearly indicate that, as proposed, the vinyl panning will be
removed and the existing 1-1/2” wood brick mold will be
retained. Additionally, the 2-1/2” applied molding proposed to
be applied to the face of the vinyl window frame shall be
eliminated. Should the existing wood brick molds be too
deteriorated to be repaired, they may be replaced to match the
historic profile or they may be covered with a custom molding
matching the historic profile.

4.

3525 S. Lake Park
(Soldiers’ Home – 4th Ward)
Proposal:

Violation: Replacement without a permit of 88 non-historic aluminum
windows with new aluminum windows; and 12 stained-glass Chapel
windows installed contrary to approved permit. Chapel windows
proposed to be modified consistent with original approval.

Action:

The Committee voted unanimously that, due to the unusual circumstances
of the project—specifically, that prior to the work there were no existing
historic windows, that the windows had been stolen and/or vandalized, and
that the replacement windows match the removed windows, as well as the
large number of windows involved—the windows, as installed, did not
have an adverse effect on the significant historical or architectural features
of the landmark building. The approval of the window replacement permit
was conditioned upon the proposed modifications to the Chapel windows
as per previously approved permit.
