WHEREAS, the Cook County Health & Hospitals System is the largest provider of safety-net healthcare
services within the State of Illinois; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Health & Hospitals System serves patients from across the State of
Illinois; and
WHEREAS, the three public hospitals that compose the Cook County Health & Hospitals System have
provided billions of dollars in uncompensated care since their establishment to those who require care the
most; and
WHEREAS, it is the uninsured and medically indigent residents of the State of Illinois who rely on the
Cook County Health & Hospitals System the most for a broad range of health services; and
WHEREAS, health coverage resulting from the passage of federal health reform will improve access to
services for those who are eligible for Medicaid coverage, resulting in better health outcomes for those
who utilize the county’s three public hospitals and vast clinic network; and
WHEREAS, Medicaid funding is critical to the Cook County Health & Hospitals System to maintain its
historic role as safety-net provider of healthcare to improve the health and well-being of all residents of
Cook County; and
WHEREAS, the Medicaid Disproportionate Share (DSH) Program and other Medicaid funding provides
critical dollars for the Cook County Health & Hospitals System for its large costs of uninsured care that it
provides to members of the county community; and
WHEREAS, the United States Congress is currently considering spending reductions and entitlement
reforms to address the federal deficit;

2

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 1, 2011
WHEREAS, reductions in the Medicaid program and the Medicaid Disproportionate Share Program
would have a direct impact on the level and amount of service that the Cook County Health & Hospitals
System provides to the neediest members of our communities.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and the Cook County Board of
Commissioners formally support the preservation of current and future Medicaid funding including those
provisions of federal health reform that extend affordable health coverage and benefits to the uninsured
and underinsured residents who must rely on the Cook County Health & Hospitals System for treatment;

A RESOLUTION CALLING ON THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY
TO REMOVE THE PROVISION THAT REQUIRES SENIORS IN COOK COUNTY
TO REAPPLY FOR THE SENIOR CITIZEN HOMEOWNER’S EXEMPTION EACH YEAR
WHEREAS, more than 284,000 senior citizens in Cook County benefit from the Senior Citizen
Homeowner’s Exemption each year, a valuable and important form of property tax relief; and
WHEREAS, the Senior Exemption can reduce a senior’s property tax bill by several hundred dollars; and
WHEREAS, in tax year 2007, the Cook County Assessor’s Office stopped requiring seniors 65 years or
older to apply annually for the Exemption and therefore saved additional processing and mailing costs;
and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Assessor’s office recently mailed 300,000 application to remind Senior
Citizens that they must apply for the Senior Citizen Exemption each year; and
WHEREAS, the Assessor’s office verifies the Exemption whenever a deed transfer occurs on a property
receiving the Exemption; and
WHEREAS, the Exemption has no income requirement and requires only that the taxpayer be 65 or older
and own the house that is their principal residence; and
WHEREAS, legislation passed by the General Assembly requires seniors to reapply every year for the
Exemption, creating an unnecessary obstacle for them; and
WHEREAS, this requirement was mandated only for Cook County and does not apply to any other
Assessor’s officer county office in Illinois; and
WHEREAS, this requirement will place an unfunded mandate on the County and require the County to
expend unnecessary funds for publications, mailings and administration of the exemption during an
economic period where any and all unnecessary expenses to taxpayers should be taken under high
consideration; and
WHEREAS, every time a major change in an exemption application process has occurred it has resulted
in confusion and missed property tax savings, especially for those exemptions specifically targeted for the
senior citizen population.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners and the
Cook County Assessor urge the General Assembly to promptly reconsider this provision imposed upon
the senior population of Cook County and remedy this provision by enacting further legislation allowing
for the Assessor to maintain the practice of verification they have installed which allowed for automatic
renewal of this valuable property tax relief for Cook County senior citizens.
Approved and adopted this 1st day of March 2011.

mentioned, respectfully reports and recommends as follows:

SECTION 1
308592

DOCKET #8646 – PSD2, LLC, Owner, Application (No. V-10-32): Variation to erect a
billboard advertising sign closer than 500 feet to Forest Preserve District property; and reduce
corner side yard setback from 30 feet to 16.2 feet for billboard advertising sign in I-1

and St. Paul Railroad and 1,052 feet west of the centerline of Waukegan Road in Northfield
Township, County Board District #14.
Recommendation: That the application be denied.
Conditions:

None

Objectors:

Mr. Banks, as attorney for 600 Waukegan Road, appeared on behalf of
the ownership of the property located immediately south of the subject
property. 600 Waukegan Road’s contention with the subject sign is that
by allowing it to be built, would precluded his client from replacing the
existing off-premise billboard advertising sign on its property because of
the Ordinance’s requirement of 500 feet of separation between offpremise billboard advertising signs.

*Deferred at the Board meeting of 09-15-10.
*Deferred at the Board meeting of 11-16-10.
*Deferred at the Board meeting of 01-19-11.

3.13 acres, located on Frontage Road, approximately 461 feet west of Waukegan Road,
extending west to the Chicago Street and Milwaukee Avenue, Paul and Pacific Railroad in
Stickney Township, County Board District #14. Recommendation: That the application be
granted.
Conditions: None
Objectors:

Mr. Storino, as attorney for PSD2, LLC, appeared on behalf of the ownership of
the property located immediately north of the subject property. PSD2’s
contention with subject sign is that by allowing it to be rebuilt, PSD2 will be
precluded from constructing a new off-premise billboard advertising sign on its
property because of the Ordinance’s requirement of 500 feet of separation
between off-premise billboard advertising signs.

310757

MICROSOFT PROFESSIONAL SUPPORT (PROPOSED CONTRACT). Transmitting a
Communication dated December 28, 2010 from Greg Wass, Chief Information Officer,
Bureau of Technology:
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with
MICROSOFT PROFESSIONAL SUPPORT, Dallas, Texas, for integration and
enhancement services to core Microsoft software infrastructure for Cook County.
Reason: Services are needed to establish a Microsoft development, test and production
environment. This integration will enhance Cook County's core computer

Microsoft SharePoint, System Center Configuration Manager, and various
application systems throughout Cook County. This enhancement will allow for the

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $1,000,000.00. Contract period: February 1, 2011 through January
31, 2014. (717/023-441 Account). Requisition No. 10230002.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 1, 2011

310951

CLERK OF THE CIRCUIT COURT, Dorothy Brown, transmitting a Communication, dated
January 6, 2011:
requesting authorization to accept a grant award in the amount of $129,600.00 from the
Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority (ICJIA). The funds will be used to improve
disposition reporting to Illinois State Police. This grant requires a cash match or an in-kind
match of a minimum of 20 percent to provide for the additional funds for providing an overall
method or system of correcting the rejected postings from the Illinois State Police's Criminal
History Record Information (CHRI) system.
As the Clerk of the Circuit Court (CCC) lacks an overall method or system of correcting the
rejected postings from the Illinois State Police’s CHRI system, CCC is proposing to build an
application that will process the rejected dispositions that did not post to CHRI, provide a
user interface to allow for updates to the information contained in the Clerk’s disposition
reporting, and to transmit that information so that it successfully posts to CHRI. This solution
will specifically provide for:
Automating the interface of records that are pushed back to CCC for correction and
resubmission to ISP’s system for updating to CHRI; and
Implementing improved data capture procedures (technical and operational) that would
facilitate complete arrest reporting, research missing dispositions and information for
reporting to ISP’s system; and
Reengineering business processes that are impacted by the new application build; and
Examining and improving data collection at critical points throughout the justice process;
and
Establishing more effective accuracy and information quality and auditable controls; and
Reducing the backlog of missing disposition or related information.

66

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 1, 2011
Additionally, the solution will have to examine the collection points of information coming
into the Circuit Court. There may be opportunities for improvements in receiving critical data
through an electronic exchange as opposed to many of manual entry points that exist today.
Lastly, CCC will also add stakeholders to the project as necessary, especially as it relates to
agencies that are identified through the data collection and exchange points, where
improvements can be made in ensuring accurate and complete information at its point of
origin. Justice XML standards will be used as appropriate.
Any and all contracts to be funded in whole, or in part, from the subject grant shall be subject
to review by the Cook County Chief Information Officer and approval by the Board of
Commissioners.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: $32,400.00. (528-818 Account). Grant Award: $129,600.00.
Funding period: January 1, 2011 through March 31, 2012.
Sufficient funds are available in the Circuit Court Automation Fund.
The Budget Department has received all requisite documents and determined the fiscal
impact on Cook County, if any.
*Referred to the Committee on Technology on 02/01/11.
Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Schneider, moved to adopt the amendment to
Communication No. 310951.
Commissioner Silvestri requested that, per Chairman Fritchey’s and Commissioner Gorman’s request, he
be added as a Sponsor to the above-mentioned Amendment, along with Chairman Fritchey.
Commissioner Silvestri read the Amendment into the record.
Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Daley, moved the approval of Communication
No. 310951, as amended. The motion carried.
311140

PRO-WEST & ASSOCIATES, INC. (PROPOSED CONTRACT).
Transmitting a
Communication, dated January 26, 2011 from Greg Wass, Chief Information Officer, Bureau
of Technology:
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with PRO-WEST
& ASSOCIATES, INC., Walker, Minnesota, for application development and automation of
data that will coordinate business work flow primarily between the offices of the Department
of Building and Zoning and the Zoning Board of Appeals.

SECURUS TECHNOLOGIES, INC. (PROPOSED CONTRACT AMENDMENT).
Transmitting a Communication, dated January 26, 2011 from Greg Wass, Chief Information
Officer, Bureau of Technology:
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to amend Contract No. 08-45-256 with
SECURUS TECHNOLOGIES, INC., Dallas, Texas, for the Coinless Inmate & Public Pay
Telephone Equipment and Services by adding coinless telephone equipment and services to
the Juvenile Detention Center facilities, create inmate debit accounts, and implement a
simplified rate structure.
Reason:

Juvenile Facility Project – Securus will provide the equipment/Applications in
connection with the Secure Call Platform (SCP) services needed to support the
required number and type of phones and other components and storage. Inmate
Debit Accounts – Upon the successful implementation of Voice Biometrics, it is
the County’s intent to install Debit accounts. This allows the inmates to call
anyone and provides inmates the option of immediately paying for and making
calls. Secure pins will be provide for easy investigation of calls and complaints, it
enhances reporting capabilities and reduces administrative costs. Simplified
Rates – rates at Cook County today are based on AT&T rates that were previously
in place. The current structure is extremely complicated for inmates and their
families. A simplified rate plan will reduce complaints, reduce fraud, eliminates
the need to use illegal remote call forwarding services and increase County
revenues by an estimated $623,000.00 annually.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: None. Contract period: December 1, 2007 through November 30,
2012.
*Referred to the Committee on Technology on February 15, 2011.
