Draft of the FY2008 AFS
Patrick J. Hagan, Michelle Agrest and Trisha Routh, of Deloitte & Touche, presented a draft of the FY2008 Annual
Financial Statement.
The Committee reviewed and discussed the information presented. Some of the subjects discussed included those
relating to material weaknesses, accounting procedures for medical malpractice accrual and pension obligations,
and the management of the pension fund.
During the discussion of the information provided, Director O’Donnell noted that the patient days were lower than
expected. Additionally, Director Greenspan inquired regarding the data presented on length of stay and the patient
acuity index; this can have a significant impact on reimbursement. Pitt Calkin, Interim Chief Financial Officer of
the Cook County Health and Hospitals System, responded that they are in the process of investigating these
questions and will report back on the subject.
With regard to the management letter, Mr. Calkin stated that although there may be repeat comments from last year,
he asked them to keep in mind that the policies and procedures necessary to address the comments could not be
brought forward until the budget was approved. He added that by February or March, the Lawson system should be
up and running; this will allow them to present a full set of financial statements for the System and will address
issues referenced in the management letter.
Chairman Muñoz inquired as to when Deloitte & Touche would be returning to the Committee with a final
management letter. Mr. Hagan responded that he expects that this will occur in September.
