Dear President Preckwinkle and Board of Commissioners:
In accordance with the County Auditor Ordinance 11-O-93 Sec. 2-311.9, at the beginning of each
fiscal year, the Auditor shall submit an audit schedule to the County Board for referral to the
Audit Committee for review and comment.
The following Audit Plan is prepared to provide a core guide for audits to be initiated during the
fiscal year. Depending on workload and the other factors mentioned in the Audit Plan, some of
these audits may not be initiated during the year, and other audits may be conducted that are not
in this plan.

Based on the FY’2019 staff level of 8 auditors and 1 Information Technology (IT) auditor, we have
determined that we have approximately 1533 audit days available (Section IV Resources). The
audit schedule consists of higher risk areas identified for audit. With the resources available, the
Office of the County Auditor (OCA) will focus on as many audit areas as possible to ensure the
best coverage.
Based on the number of audit days available, our goal is to initiate audits as outlined in SECTION
V: FY’2019 AUDIT SCHEDULE. We will also continue to provide assistance to the Comptroller’s
Office in the preparation of the November 30, 2018 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report
(CAFR). In addition, the Audit Plan provides for management consulting requests, special audits
and assistance with special projects as the need is determined throughout the fiscal year.

or suggestions.

 SECTION I: INTRODUCTION
Authority

The Office of the County Auditor (OCA) operates in accordance with the County Ordinance, Division 6 Auditor, which grants the OCA the authority to conduct financial, management and performance audits
of all Cook County departments, offices, boards, activities, agencies and programs and in any
government entity that is funded in whole or in part by the County pursuant to the County's annual
appropriation bill.

Mission

The mission of the OCA is to provide independent and objective assurance and consulting services
designed to add value and improve the County’s operations while promoting transparency and
accountability in government. The OCA assists the County in accomplishing its objectives by bringing a
systematic, disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of countywide risk
management, control, and governance processes.

Role

An internal audit department plays a significant role in the development and sustainability of a strong
internal control system. The internal audit activity provides assurance to management and the audit
committee that risks to the organization are understood and managed appropriately. The following are
the major roles and responsibilities of the internal audit function.
 Assess risk Countywide to identify the audit universe and apply audit resources in the most
effective and efficient manner
 Conduct value added audits in a professional manner with high integrity
 Evaluate and provide reasonable assurance that risk management, control, and governance
systems are functioning as intended and will enable the organization’s objectives and goals to be
met
 Report noncompliance issues and internal control deficiencies directly to the President, Board of
Commissioners and Audit Committee and provide recommendations for improving the
organization’s operations, in terms of both efficient and effective performance
 Assess the information technology environment and associated risk exposures
 Maintain open communication with the Board, Cook County leadership, and Audit Committee
 Team with other internal and external resources as appropriate
 Adhere to auditing standards
 Comply with continuous education and staff development requirements

Standards

The OCA adheres to the following standards in conducting the audits:
•
Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards (The Yellow Book)
•
Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) Professional Standards
•
ISACA Information Technology Audit Standards

Page 3

 SECTION II: APPROACH
The IIA’s International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing Performance Standard
2010 (Planning) and ISACA’s IS Auditing Standard S5 (Planning) require that the OCA establish a risk-based
plan to determine the priorities of the audit activity, consistent with the organization’s goals and available
audit resources.
As part of the development of the FY’2019 Audit Plan, the OCA implemented the Countywide Risk
Assessment Program. The Countywide Risk Assessment provides a basis for the preparation of the Annual
Audit Plan while enhancing the objectivity and transparency of the audit process. Key factors across the
various offices and departments are evaluated to assess risk and allocate audit resources. A risk assessment
is essential to ensuring that audit resources are applied in the most effective and efficient manner.
For FY’2019, the audit universe consisted of the high-level departments within the Offices under the
President, the Elected Offices and the Forest Preserve District. The following are the risk factors that were
applied:
 Public Exposure
 Compliance with Regulations
 Employee Turnover
 Audit Coverage
 Financial Impact (Appropriation, Revenue, Expenses, Contracts, Grants)
 Automation
 Sensitivity and Confidentiality

SECTION III: AUDIT PLAN IMPLEMENTATION
The audit schedule is a fluid document. The audit schedule consists of higher risk areas identified for
audit. With the limited resources, the OCA will focus on as many audit areas as possible to ensure the best
coverage. The audit schedule and/or the nature and timing of the audits may vary based on the following:

Requests by management;

Changes in laws, statutes, regulations, and other mandates;

Major changes in operations, programs, systems, and controls;

Availability of key personnel;

Potential loss and risk exposure; and

Changes in audit resources.
