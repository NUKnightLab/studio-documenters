STAFF REPORT 07-24-2019 SPECIAL MEETING
APPLICATION NUMBER: 19-6340
ADDRESS: 1205 HUBBARD STREET
HISTORIC DISTRICT: HUBBARD FARMS
APPLICANT: TRACIE MCMILLAN
STAFF SITE VISIT: 07-16-2019

PREPARED BY: A. PHILLIPS

PROPOSAL
The building located at 1205 Hubbard Street is a 2½-story single-family residence constructed ca. 1900. The structure
is clad in wide aluminum siding that is light yellow in color with white wood and aluminum trim. It appears that many
of the original wood windows are intact. The asymmetrical façade includes a small porch at the entry which is topped
with a gable roof. The multi-gable roof is covered in light gray asphalt shingles. Aluminum awnings exist over the
two main windows on the front façade. Faux shutters flank the main window on the first floor.

 With the current proposal, the applicant is seeking the Commission’s approval to repair the existing aluminum
siding, paint the main body of the house a dark blue color that is not included in the assigned color charts B
and C, and remove existing aluminum awnings per the attached application.
STAFF OBSERVATIONS
• Existing aluminum awnings are not considered historic nor are they character-defining features of the style of
architecture in which the house is built.
ELEMENTS OF DESIGN

(1) Height. Commercial and institutional buildings range from one (1) story to four (4) stories in height; some have single
stories with very high ceilings and balconies, such as Aijalon Church, the former bank building at 4138 W. Vernor, and
Bowen Library. Buildings in Clark Park are generally one (1) or one and one-half (1½) stories tall, with additional height in
a steep roof. Residential buildings range from one and one-half (1½) stories to five (5) stories, the smallest being the
Workers Cottages seen primarily on Bagley and the tallest being the five-story Whitedel Apartment Building on Porter and
Hubbard. The majority of residential buildings are either two (2) or two and one-half (2-½) stories tall, meaning they have
two (2) full stories with an attic or finished third floor within the roof. Where height specifications were included in the
original subdivision restrictions, they should be complied with for new construction. Detached garages are generally one (1)
to one-and-one-half (1-½) stories tall. Additions to residential structures shall be related in height to the existing structure;
new buildings shall meet the following standards:
(A) The eight (8) adjoining structures on the same block face shall be used to determine an average height. The height
of the two (2) adjoining houses shall be added into the total twice, with a divisor of ten (10) used to determine the
average. Any new building must have a height of the main roof of at least eighty percent (80%) of the resulting
average; in no case shall a new building be taller than the tallest roof height included in the computation. In
determining the heights of existing structures and proposed structures, the highest point of the main roof shall be
used, even where towers, cupolas, or other minor elements may be taller.
(B) The level of the eaves of a proposed new residential structure having as much or more significance for
compatibility as the roof height, an average eave or cornice height shall be determined by the same process as that
described above. The proposed new structure shall have a height at the eaves, or cornice, of not less than ninety
(percent) (90%) of the average determined from existing structures, and in no case shall the eaves or cornice of the
proposed structure be lower than the lowest eave or cornice height used in the computation, nor higher than the
highest.
(2) Proportion of building's front facades. Proportion varies in the district, depending on type of building, age, style, and
subdivision. Most single family houses are neutral to their eaves, although some are wider than tall and some taller than
wide. Terrace buildings (rows) are wider than tall, although individual units are taller than wide or neutral. Apartment
buildings are generally taller than wide or neutral. No proposed residential building or addition shall create a front facade
narrower or wider than those existing on the same block. Commercial buildings on W. Vernor may be wider than tall, taller
than wide, or neutral but when they abut other buildings they form a row that is wider than tall. Bowen Library is wider than
tall, as is Western High School and Earhart Middle School on Scotten. The Clark Street facade of Maybury School is
neutral. Aijalon Church is wider than tall when taken as a whole.
(3) Proportion of openings within the facade. Proportion varies according to building type, age, and style. Generally, window
openings in the district are predominantly taller than wide; several windows are frequently grouped into combinations wider
than tall. Window openings are most often subdivided, the most common window type being double-hung sash, whose area
is generally further subdivided by muntins. Queen Anne style buildings and special use buildings, such as Aijalon Church at
330 W. Grand Boulevard, display windows that may be wider than tall, arched, or square. In general, buildings have
between fifteen (15) percent and thirty-five (35) percent of their area glazed.
(4) Rhythm of solids to voids in front facades. Window openings are usually regularly arranged by floor, although there is most
often variety between floor levels. In the Queen Anne and Richardsonian Romanesque style buildings, openings are often
irregularly arranged. In buildings derived from classical precedents, voids are usually arranged in a symmetrical and evenlyspaced manner within the facade. In bungalows and arts and crafts influenced buildings, large areas of voids are filled with
windows. Many of the residential buildings have dormers or gables that are fenestrated.
(5) Rhythm of spacing of buildings on streets. The spacing of buildings is generally determined by the setback from the side
lot line. There is a variance in the width of lots from subdivision to subdivision. In general, residential and commercial
buildings are spaced close together as a result of their narrow lot width and/or maximized building size. Single/two family
houses are centered between side lots or are sited very close to one (1) side lot line to provide additional space on the other
side. Infrequently, two (2) lots are grouped together, creating a side lot. On Vernor and elsewhere where buildings have
been demolished, the continuous line or rhythm of buildings is disrupted.
(6) Rhythm of entrance and/or porch projections. Placement of entrance and porch projections vary from building to building,

 usually depending on type, size and style. In general, a great variety of porches and entrances characterize Hubbard Farms.
In those examples of classical inspiration, entrances and porches tend to be centered on the front facade or balance each
other if there are more than one, as on terrace buildings and duplexes. Other examples, display more freedom in entrance
and porch placement. Secondary entrances are common; Italianate houses and small Queen Anne cottages frequently have
small side porches. Porches on houses built around the turn of the century tend to be large, sometimes stretching along most
of the first story, while English and arts and crafts influenced buildings tend to have deemphasized entrances. Where similar
houses line a block a rhythmic progression of porches is created. Most of the houses in the district have rear porches.
(7) Relationship of materials. Brick and wood are the primary building materials originally used. Brick buildings may have
pressed brick front facades with common brick sides and rears. Many wood frame buildings are clad in clapboard. While
most buildings have brick foundations, some foundations are of stone. Buildings originally built on wood piers originally
had wooden skirting. A few buildings were built of concrete block. Wood trim is most commonly used for window, porch,
and functional elements as well as decorative trim; some lintels and sills also exist. Stucco with or without half-timbering is
either the main building material or combined with brick on a few English revival and arts and crafts style houses. Front
porch step materials are either wood or concrete. Brick of the more substantial buildings, such as Aijalon Church and
Maybury and Western High Schools, is contrasted with stone foundations, trim and detail. Earhart Middle School is cast
concrete. A small number of original slate roofs are present; the majority of original roofing materials have been replaced by
asphalt shingles.
(8) Relationship of textures. A variety of rich textural relationships exist in the district—those created by the juxtaposition of
various materials, such as brick, stone, stucco, and/or wood, and those created by the repetition of the materials themselves,
such as clapboard, wood fish scale shingles or decorative brick. Slate roofs create textural interest, whereas asphalt shingles
generally do not. Textured concrete block houses built in the early twentieth century have a large degree of textural interest.
(9) Relationship of colors. Natural brick colors (red, brown, orange, buff) predominate on brick wall surfaces. Stucco is usually
cream, off white, or pale yellow in color. Wooden elements display a variety of colors, depending on what is appropriate for
their style. In general, wooden elements of buildings derived from classical precedents, such as the Neo-Georgian or
Colonial revival, are painted in the white-yellow-gray range, while wooden elements of Victorian buildings show more
freedom, ranging from shades of rose to green, sometimes with a contrasting color highlighting the architectural detail.
Wooden elements of bungalows and arts and crafts influenced buildings tend to be painted in earth tones. Asphalt shingle
roofs display a range of colors, from natural slate colors and black to lighter shades of green, gray, brown and red. The
original colors of any building, as determined by professional analysis, are always acceptable for that building, and may
provide suggestions for similar buildings.
(10) Relationship of architectural details. Architectural details generally relate to style. Colonial revival buildings display
classical details, often in wood. Porches are commonly treated and usually have columns of a classical order. Buildings of
Victorian substyles also tend to have details of wood located around the entrance, porch, windows, bays, towers, and
dormers. Lathe-turned and jig-saw cut wooden elements and details are common. Prairie and arts and crafts style buildings
tend to be simply stated, with architectural interest derived from the arrangement of elements and quality of design. In
general, the Hubbard Farms District is extremely rich in architectural detail.
(11) Relationship of roof shapes. Most every roof type is represented in the district, from flat roofs on terrace buildings and
commercial buildings to hipped, pitched, and gambrel roofs on single-family residences. Roof shapes are generally related
to style. Bungalows, arts and crafts influenced and Prairie style houses have shallow roofs; Queen Anne and other Victorian
substyles exhibit greater heights, intersecting planes and steep slopes.
(12) Walls of continuity. The major wall of continuity is created by the front facades of the buildings, where there are uniform
setbacks within subdivisions. Trees planted between the sidewalk and the curb create a secondary wall of continuity.
(13) Relationship of significant landscape features and surface treatments. The Hubbard Farms District is defined by the
curbless; graded grass turf islands in the center of West Grand Boulevard on the east and Clark Park, a major public park,
on the west. The northern half of Clark Park is landscaped and graded for passive recreational use. Its widening black
asphalt paths are lined with modern black steel slighting standards. Picnic shelters, modest playground equipment and
mature and more recently planted trees are located on the northern half. The southern half is occupied by more active
recreational facilities, such as tennis courts, basketball courts, a playscape, and a large playfield enclosed by a chain-link
fence. The typical treatment of individual properties is a flat or graded front lawn area in grass turf, often subdivided by a
straight or curved concrete walk leading to the front entrance. Foundation plantings are of the evergreen and/or deciduous
nature; a tree or two (2) are usually planted in the front yard as well. On those parts of streets with graded tree lawns,
particularly on the southern ends of Vinewood and Hubbard, concrete steps lead up to the sidewalk from the curb. Tree
lawns between the curb and public sidewalk are generally narrow throughout the district, and do not exist on Vernor. On
Hubbard and Vinewood, the original flag-stone curbs still exist; elsewhere, curbs are concrete. Because of the narrow lot
sizes, there are few side driveways in the neighborhood, and where they exist, they were added after the initial development
of the neighborhood. Where there are no driveways or front yard fences, there is a continuous visual progression of front
yards. On the western side of the southern end of Hubbard to the rear of Earhart School on Scotten, there is no alley; houses
backing on the school have front-facing garages accessed by driveways off of Hubbard. The majority of fences are of the

 chain link variety; four (4) foot chain-link fenced front yards are seen throughout the district but to a lesser degree at the
south end of Hubbard and Vinewood. Rear yards are frequently enclosed by chain link, wood plank, or stockade fencing. A
few houses have black wrought iron fences. Few houses have hedges along the lot lines. Chain-link fencing encloses the
playfields to the south of Western High School and the Earhart School parcel. The parking lot to the north of Western High
School is bermed and has tall steel lighting standards within. Street lights throughout the district are on wooden poles, with
the exception of the tall steel light poles with modern lanterns on West Vernor and tall fluted standards with crane-neck
pendants and old style lanterns on West Grand Boulevard. Some home owners have installed uniform outdoor lighting
standards in their front yards in recent years. Alleys are either concrete or black asphalt; the north-south alley between West
Grand Boulevard and Vinewood from Shady Lane to Porter is brick-paved.
(14) Relationship of open space to structures. The major open space is Clark Park, which has houses facing it across north-south
streets, commercial buildings across Vernor, and Fisher Freeway to its south. The wide grassy islands in the center of West
Grand Boulevard provide significant open space to those buildings facing it. The siting of most residential buildings on their
lots create rear yards as well as front yards, the exceptions being those buildings situated on zero (0) lot lines, such as the
commercial buildings on Vernor, YMCA on Clark, the Yorba Hotel on Lafayette, and Terrace Buildings, on side streets.
Because of the minimal setback of some Terrace Buildings, apartment buildings, and houses on the east-west streets, some
front yards are very shallow. Side lots are minimal if they exist, unless a vacant lot is joined with the house lot. While some
vacant lots exist throughout the district, large vacant parcels are usually located on Vernor between commercial buildings to
provide parking on Lafayette, where demolition occurred due to the construction of the Freeway, leaving irregularly shaped
parcels, and on corners, where Terrace Buildings have been demolished. A planted area on the southwest corner of
Lafayette at West Grand Boulevard makes an entrance into the district; a grass turf open space is located at the northeast
corner of Scotten and Lafayette just south of Earhart Middle School.
(15) Scale of facades and facade elements. Houses are generally small to moderate in scale. Facade elements and details vary in
scale and are generally dependent on style. Detail on arts and crafts, influenced buildings tends to be architectonic in nature;
on Victorian Buildings decorative detail tends to be small in scale while facade elements, such as bays, dormers and towers,
are large in scale. Classically influenced buildings tend to have large scale elements such as columns.
(16) Directional expression of front elevations. In general, directional expression is neutral, due to inform heights and narrow
lots. On Vernor, where commercial buildings are contiguous, the overall directional expression is horizontal.
(17) Rhythm of building setbacks. Setbacks of front facades are uniform within subdivisions, with few exceptions, although
porch projections vary. Houses on the first block of Clark south of W. Vernor and the first block of Clark north of Lafayette
have irregular setbacks. Apartment buildings located on corner lots and within blocks on Hubbard are located closer to the
front lot line than individual homes, creating inconsistency to the streetscape. On Vernor, facades are located directly on the
front lot line. On the side streets, such as Bagley and Porter, setbacks are shallow but usually consistent.
(18) Relationship of lot coverage. Lot sizes vary within the district, but are generally consistent within subdivisions. Primary
buildings on residential lots occupy twenty-five percent (25%) to ninety percent (90%) of their lots. The deep lots with
single family houses on Hubbard are at the low end and lots occupied by large apartment buildings, Terrace Buildings
(rows), and duplexes on side streets are at the high end of that range. Commercial buildings on West Vernor occupy most of
their lots; lot coverages of institutional buildings vary due to the addition of adjoining lots to original parcels but they
generally occupy a high percentage of their lots.
(19) Degree of complexity within the facade. The degree of complexity has been determined by what is typical and appropriated
for a given style. The classically inspired buildings usually have simple, rectangular facades with varying amounts of
ornamentation. The Victorian substyles tend to be more complex, complicated by towers, gables, and decorated porches.
The arts and crafts and bungalow style houses are not complex.
(20) Orientation, vistas, overviews. The main streets in the district run north-south; Vernor Highway is the major commercial
thoroughfare and runs east-west. The secondary streets: Bagley, Porter, Clark Court and Lafayette, run east-west. Fisher
Freeway forms an emphatic southern boundary. Terrace Buildings (row) are frequently oriented towards the east-west
streets but may have one (1) or more units facing the north-south street at the corner. Lafayette jogs to accommodate
modifications made when the Fisher Freeway was constructed; Fisher Freeway forms an emphatic southern boundary to the
district. From the Freeway, the Yorba Hotel sign provides a visual landmark in the neighborhood.
(21) Symmetric or asymmetric appearance. Classically inspired buildings are generally symmetrical; other styles are generally
asymmetric but result in balanced compositions.
(22) General environmental character. The Hubbard Farms District appears as a late-nineteenth, early twentieth century
neighborhood that grew as a street car, suburb off of a busy commercial thoroughfare (Vernor). Its mixed use and
multidensity character survives to this day. The area was designed with visual and recreational amenities, such as the grassy
treed and graded islands in the middle of West Grand Boulevard and Clark Park. The neighborhood is generally well
maintained and intact today, although the commercial thoroughfare is showing signs of decline.

RECOMMENDATION
It is staff’s opinion that the work, as proposed, does not remove historic materials nor does it alter any features or

 spaces that characterize the building, its site, or setting. Staff therefore recommends that the Commission find the
removal of the aluminum awnings and painting the exterior of the house in the dark blue color as proposed to be
appropriate as the scope of work meets the following Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation:
• 2) The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of historic materials or
alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided.

Description of existing conditions
The existing exterior is wood aluminum siding with wood trime. As when I bought it, the trim is
a clean, non-yellow white; the metal overlay on the brick understory is painted a dark gray; and
the exterior aluminum siding is a faded light yellow.
Much of the building’s caulk is brittle and cracked; there are many holes in the siding; and there
are signs of mold. There are some issues with flashing having been installed poorly.
There are also two aluminum awnings—dirty, rusted, of aluminum, and likely added in the
1960s when they were in fashion—on the front of the house. They were painted poorly by
previous painters, and this has opened the door for mold.

Description of project
I purchased 1205 Hubbard in 2015 through the Detroit Land Bank, which had brokered the sale
on behalf of the Michigan Land Bank. The home had been empty for two years prior, and had
clearly not been maintained prior to that for some time. I have focused the first several years of
ownership on making the home safe, inhabitable and stable: an entirely new roof, significant
improvements to basement waterproofing and drainage, a new furnace, new flooring. Much
work remains, but I am now at a point where I can afford to invest in the house’s exterior.
I am seeking approval to paint the body of the house a color that is not currently part of the
default color schemes for the neighborhood. I would leave trim the same clean white it was
when I bought the house, and the understory the same dark gray, though I’m having both
scraped and repainted. I had hoped to limit my repair work this year to the trim and gutters,
but as my contractor has done his work, it’s become clear that the siding is in very poor shape
and this is causing slow, steady damage to the building by allowing weather to enter. I hope to
paint my house a dark blue, which will highlight and contrast nicely with stained glass detail on
the second story—currently hidden behind the awnings, and in need of repair (once I can afford
to do so). That said, the neighborhood’s color schemes offer only one real blue, and it is used
twice on the block preceding mine. With this in mind, I’ve proposed an alternate color I believe
is attractive, adds value to the home and block, and is in line with the neighborhood aesthetic.
I would also like to remove the aluminum awnings, which were likely added in the 1960s and
have no historic value.
