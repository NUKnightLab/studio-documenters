Background
The non-dwelling facility located at 1000 N. Sedgwick is a CHA-owned, two-story building that is
approximately 25,000 square feet and was built in the early 1970’s. This property is located within the
Cabrini-Green Development near the intersection of Orleans Street and Oak Street and is adjacent to the
Cabrini-Green Rowhomes and Seward Park. This property is comprised of a gymnasium, weight room,
warming kitchen, assembly room, administrative offices, outdoor playground and nine (9) classrooms.
The CHA awarded a contract to CCC Holdings, Inc. dba Chicago Commercial Construction at the May 2017
Board meeting for the renovation of the building located at 1000 N. Sedgwick Street to upgrade,
modernize and bring the property in line with overall CHA building standards, accessibility requirements
and current building codes. The contract award inclusive of the approved contingency was a total not-toexceed amount of $4,500,868.12. Since the May 2017 Board meeting, the project experienced several
1

 delays associated with existing poor soil conditions and structural issues that prevented the timely
completion of base scope work. The poor condition of the existing soils under the building to support the
planned new elevator and other existing adverse structural conditions (including, but not limited to, those
associated with roof decking and existing building structural steel and masonry) could not have been
discovered except during the extensive demolition phase of the construction. The scope of demolition
necessarily became more extensive as the extent of the adverse discovered conditions became better
known and efforts were made to determine the full scope of such conditions. The contract modification
hereby recommended for approval is required to compensate the General Contractor for extended
general conditions for the additional time and overhead costs required to complete this project. Upon
authorization of this contract modification, the revised total contract value for the General Contractor will
be an amount not to exceed $5,226,289.36.
The contract modification associated with the contract is required solely to address the following issue:
