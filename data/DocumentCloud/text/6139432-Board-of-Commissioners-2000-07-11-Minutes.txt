CITY OF BLUE ISLAND
NO CASH BID REQUEST
Transm itting a Communication, dated July 7, 2000 from
DEBORAH SIMS, Chairman, Tax De linque ncy Subcommittee
Submitting a request from
DONALD E. PELOQUIN, May or, City of Blue Is la nd
I am writing to you on behalf of the res idents of the C ity of Blue Is land. We are requesting your
assistance in securing tax delinquent properties on a no cash bid bas is from the County scavenger sale.
These properties have been an eyesore fo r the residents that live next to them for years. Our building
department has tried numerous times to contact the property owner to no avail. Some of the lots will be
used for s ingle family housing and we have a contractor interested in building on the lots. We are also
try ing to secure an abandoned restaurant/store whic h is in need of repair. The city wou ld be seeking a
RFP in regards to selling or giving th is property to a n entity . My staff and I believe that a small
grocery/deli sto re wou ld be the most productive use of the property. Two additional lots adjacent to a
local church, would be used for both commuter and church parking.
The C ity of Blue Is land w ill retain legal counsel to obtain the tax deed and w ill bear all legal and othe r
costs associated with acq uisition of the parcels.

SB 906

Mr. Morrill stated the Board had opposed and stopped this bill from advancing in the 1999 session, but
two weeks prior to the end of the 2000 session, it came out of House Rules Committee and passed in two
days. He stated the bill was an initiative of the Township Officials and authorizes townships in Cook
County to establish plan commissions with the authority to file official township plans for unincorporated
areas of the County . He stated the bill does not preempt home rule authority and therefore would not
impact Cook County's zoning and land use authority. Mr. Morrill reported that the bill passed both
chambers and was approved by the Governor as Pub Iic Act 91-738.
Commissioner Schumann made a brief observation that the proposal will need a lot of attention from
Comm issioners, who have a majority of unincorporated land in their districts since this is spec ifically
geared to look at Cook County zoning and land use.
Commissioner Schumann requested information from the President's Office regarding how the legislation
will impact the County 's services and authority as it relates to the Zoning Board of Appeals and the
various departments involved in enforcing the Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance and Land Use Plan, and
in general how this will be implemented in Cook County.
In closing Mr. Morrill stated that the big success the County had this sess ion was in the State' s budget
and the 20% ($8 1. 7 million) increase in appropriations Cook County succeeded in obtaining with the
support and assistance of the Governor and leaders in the House and Senate.
Vice Chairman Lechowicz noted the report
Intergovernmental Relation's Office detailing
received, stating that it reflects the cooperation
with Governor Ryan and the House and Senate

President Stroger sent to the Comm issioners from his
the increased dollars and specific line items the County
and good relationship President Stroger and the Board has
leaders.

Vice Chairman Lechowicz moved to have a letter or resolution, drafted by the lobbyists and with
the assistance of the President's Office, memorializing the Governor and leadership thanking them
for their support and assistance in regards to the appropriations Cook County government received
from the State oflllinois. Seconded by Commissioner Daley, the motion carried unanimously.
