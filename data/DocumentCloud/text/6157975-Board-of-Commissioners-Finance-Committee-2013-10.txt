CHAIRMAN DALEY:

2

MR. SAMSTEIN:

Mr. Samstein.
Good morning, Chairman

3

Daley, and members of the Finance Committee.

4

our great honor to present to you President

5

Preckwinkle's executive budget recommendation for

6

fiscal year 2014.

7

It is

This is the fourth consecutive

8

balanced budget the Administration has presented.

9

Under the leadership of President Preckwinkle, and

10

the Board of Commissioners, the County has reduced

11

taxes by a net $1.1 billion during these four budget

12

cycles by rolling back the sales tax rate to 0.75%.

13

In fiscal year 2014, we will continue

14

our commitment to reform and the President's pillars

15

of fiscal responsibility, innovative leadership,

16

improved services, and transparency and

17

accountability.

18

list of proposed financial policies, and maintains

19

the County's strong financial position as we

20

continue to address long-term challenges.

21

This budget document includes a

Through diligent cash management

22

strategies, during fiscal 2013, we have repaid the

23

entire $46 million that you authorized us to draw

24

from the County's $200 million line of credit.

This

1

early repayment of debt associated with the Young

2

lawsuit settlement is a function of the County's

3

strong financial position.
This year we continue to work towards

4
5

streamlining the budget process, and I think

6

officials across the County will agree that Budget

7

Director Andrea Gibson, and her team, have continued

8

to institute best practices in budgeting countywide.

9

One factor in which this is evidenced is that

10

departmental requests this year were initially $44

11

million greater than the Budget Department targets.
Just two years ago -- I just want a

12
13

comparison -- there were $155 million in additional

14

requests.

15

and her team, have developed a diligent process to

16

document and vet requests while working

17

collaboratively with departments and separate

18

elected officials' officers.

19

This change reflects that Andrea Gibson,

With the reforms and advances

20

identified in this budget recommendation, we

21

continue to address the County's longstanding

22

financial challenges in a manner that will allow us

23

to deliver high-quality services in the years ahead

24

without unduly burdening Cook County taxpayers'

residences and businesses.

We appreciate the

2

leadership of President Preckwinkle, and the Board

3

of Commissioners, in this regard, and we thank each

4

of you for your support on these initiatives.

5

We have assembled a truly outstanding

6

team of truly finance professionals who are working

7

to implement reforms and institute best practices in

8

each of their respective areas.
This team includes Andrea Gibson, our

9
10

Budget Director; Lawrence Wilson, Comptroller;

11

Jackie Gomez, Director of Contract Compliance;

12

Prasad Nettem, Director of the ERP Center of

13

Excellence; Shannon Andrews, our Chief Procurement

14

Officer; Zahra Ali, Revenue Director; Deanna Zalas,

15

Risk Management Director; and Ammar Rizki, our

16

Deputy Chief Financial Officer.
I would like to frame the 2014 budget

17
18

for you.

greater detail how we closed the preliminary budget

20

gap.

will walk you through highlights of their respective

22

areas and their departmental budgets.

I would now like to draw your
attention to the presentation that we will be

I believe that we have

also distributed copies which are on your desks.
When we look at this first slide --

3
4

this is a slide that many of you are familiar with,

5

which is the preliminary identified budget gaps in

6

each of the last four fiscal years.

7

that it is steadily decreasing.

8

9

still a significant number, that $152 million.

You will note

It does reflect a
That is

I think the important point here is

10
11

that structural changes each year have a compounding

12

effect.

13

pass on to the next, and help produce a structural

14

deficit.

15

a $152 million deficit that Andrea and her team

16

worked to close.

Structural changes implemented in one year

That allowed us to work from a premise of

framed.

a goal to increase the self-sufficiency of the

Health System and reduce the Health System's

subsidy.

splits it into the Health Enterprise Fund, separate

2

and distinct from the General Fund, which has

3

historically included the Health Fund, Corporate,

4

and Public Safety.

5

These changes in the reduced self-

6

sufficiency has been enabled by the success of the

7

Health System enrolling the primary care patients

8

into CountyCare.

9

significant component.

10

That has obviously been a very

The other major tenet of this budget

11

was to invest in technology projects, strategic ones

12

that improve services and increase accountability.

13

The intent was to look at projects that have long-

14

term dividends.

15

At this point, I would like to turn to

16

the Budget Director, Andrea Gibson, who will discuss

17

how we close the gap.

18
19
20

MS. GIBSON:

Thank you.

Andrea Gibson,

Budget Director.
If you look at this next slide, this

21

shows basically how we close the gap that we

22

identified at the end of June.

23

How we addressed that was $97 million through the

24

Health System; which mostly ties back to the one

It was $152 million.

hundred percent reimbursement from the Federal

2

Government under Medicaid expansion.

3

identified $14.5 million in savings from health

4

benefits and pharmacy benefit savings, compared to

5

what we thought we would have to pay at the time of

6

the preliminary budget.

We also

We experienced some revenue growth,

7
8

both in terms of an improving economy as is shown in

9

the real property transfer tax, sales tax, corporate

10

income tax, but also in our enforcement efforts,

11

including the enforcement of the cigarette tax and

12

the Assessor's homeowners' exemption tax fraud

13

enforcement.
We identified a number of expenditure

14
15

reductions after the preliminary budget, including a

16

reduction in personnel -- vacant positions -- and

17

also some contractual savings; especially in some of

18

the IT contracts as well as energy savings from

19

implementing the efficient equipment in our

20

building.
If you look at page seven, this shows

21
22

you the reduction in the health subsidy.

Ivan

23

mentioned that this was one of the key features of

24

the budget.

It reduced the health subsidy by $76

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 10

1

million.

But you can see, if you go back to 2010,

2

it is actually a fifty-five percent reduction from

3

that time.

4

Medicaid expansion, and getting the Section 1115

5

waiver last year.

Of course, this ties back to CountyCare,

If you look at our budget as a whole

6
7

across all funds, these are the different revenue

8

sources.

9

over year.

This shows you what percent changes year
The biggest change is obviously the

10

fees.

That is where the CountyCare-Medicaid

11

expansion in fees come in.

12

As I mentioned, the reimbursement from

13

the Federal Government goes from forty-eight percent

14

to one hundred percent next year for those who are

15

eligible for that program.

16

an individual who is within the 133% poverty level,

17

you would be eligible to enroll in CountyCare.

18

And, again, if you are

Something else of note on that slide

19

is that our grant revenue is expected to go up.

20

That is mostly because of the additional funding for

21

the Land Bank that we received from the Attorney

22

General, as well as Homeland Security grants.

23
24

The personal property replacement tax
is something that I mentioned a moment ago.

That is

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 11

1

the corporate income tax.

That all goes towards our

2

Pension Fund.

3

that makes more property tax funds available to the

4

General Fund.

That is improving quite a bit, and

If you look at the next page, this

5
6

shows the allocation of the revenue across the types

7

of funds.

8

the Health fund from the General Fund, which is now

9

just the Corporate and Public Safety Fund.

10

As Ivan mentioned, we are separating out

You will see there that the General

11

Fund is increasing by $43.5 million.

12

principally to some of the required public safety

13

staffing and requirements under both the Department

14

of Justice order for the jail and the new

15

legislation entitled, "Raise the Age".

16

seventeen-year-olds charged with felonies going

17

through the juvenile system rather than the adult.

18

That relates

That has

Also you will notice the largest

19

increase is in the Health Fund.

In order to be

20

eligible for the reimbursement that I just spoke of,

21

we need to invest in providing certain services for

22

CountyCare; some of which include areas like

23

substance abuse treatment, mental health services;

24

areas that we haven't historically provided the
________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 12

1

services for.

But, again, this increase in the

2

expenditures results in a more dramatic increase in

3

reimbursements.

4

If you look at the next page, this

5

looks a little bit more closely at the Corporate

6

Fund, the Public Safety Fund, and as a separate fund

the Health Enterprise Fund.

With that, I will turn it back over to

MR. SAMSTEIN:

breakdown of where the dollars come from and where

18

we spend dollars in this spending plan.

19

note specifically on the right side of where the

20

spending occurs it is not inconsistent with previous

years where roughly thirty-two percent is to the

Health System.

spending.

COMMISSIONER SUFFREDIN:

13

Thank you, Mr.

14

Chairman, and ladies and gentlemen of the Committee.

15

Ivan, let's just talk about the grants

16

that were just discussed.

17

understand, since we are dealing with a $152 million

18

shortfall.

19

increase are the Homeland Security and the Land

20

Bank.

22

I am trying to

MR. SAMSTEIN:

to address that question.
MS. GIBSON:

not lower our shortfall.

7

revenues; especially from State and Federal

Government.

10

We took a look at what

We observed that we get a lot fewer

These grants typically do help us

11

provide services, pilot programs, but they don't

12

typically pay for basic operations or as an offset

13

to the General Fund.

14

We do, however, have an opportunity,

15

if we do receive a grant, to charge indirect, if

16

there is an overhead amount there.

17

about trying to get more resources to Cook County

18

than getting grants to solve the budget deficit.

19

COMMISSIONER SUFFREDIN:

But it is more

I appreciate that.

20

But what I am trying to understand here -- let's

21

take the Land Bank.

22

dollars do not directly affect any expenditure by

23

the County; correct?

24

MS. GIBSON:

The Land Bank, those grant

That's right.

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 16

COMMISSIONER SUFFREDIN:

1

If you take the

2

Homeland Security, while we probably get some

3

indirect expenditures -- maybe there is some salary

4

for some of the people there -- it really doesn't

5

affect even our indirect expenditures; correct?
MS. GIBSON:

6

I don't recall what the

7

indirect rate is on that particular grant.

8

dispute that the grants don't help us with the

9

deficit.

10
11

I don't

It just helps us do additional programming

or bring more resources to the County.
COMMISSIONER SUFFREDIN:

When I understood

12

what the President was saying in terms of grant

13

growth, I thought we were talking more along the

14

lines of the State type grants, which we probably

15

far exceed the other counties.

16

Federal side, we have not done as well.

17

take just the Child Support Division, you take the

18

money that comes from the Illinois Criminal Justice

19

Authority, those are all dollars that go into the

20

Sheriff, the Chief Judge, the State's Attorney's

Office for direct expenditure of personnel and

operation in the State, and probably in the Midwest.

3

MS. GIBSON:

I'm looking for some

That is actually an

4

interesting grant to mention because that is a

5

declining grant.

6

that grant, and it has been difficult for the

7

various offices that receive that grant to absorb

8

because they still have to perform the functions.

The State has been cutting back on

I think that is all the more reason to

9
10

try to obtain additional grant dollars.

11

like it if we found grant dollars that pay for some

12

of the core functions, but I didn't mean to mislead

13

by saying the Homeland Security or the Land Bank

14

would help pay for the basic functions.

15

helps overall.

Do we have any idea of how many people

we are really talking about who are off of our

general revenue fund, and are really on the salaries

of these grants?

9

look at as we discuss trying to increase grants and

10

That would be helpful for us to

what kind of grants are better for us.
MS. GIBSON:

11

Yes.

It is difficult

12

operationally to have a grant in midyear and it is

13

disruptive, certainly then if the employee is let

14

go.

15

I would say that at times when the

16

grants have reduced -- for the child support, we

17

have worked with some of the different offices to

18

identify positions in the General Fund that may

19

become vacant where they can shift those employees

20

rather than laying off.

COMMISSIONER SUFFREDIN:

I understand that,

but then that is an expense to us.

If we are

going to use the grants as a way to increase our

revenue and show a healthier budget, I think we have

got to be able to show both sides of it.
I will put a question in writing to

8
9

you asking you to just kind of deal with this.

I

10

think that otherwise we look like we are hiding

11

behind grants that, in fact, I don't think really

impact our general operation.

It is operating

16

In terms of the budgeting, I notice

17

that you how a reduction in expenditures of about

18

$10.5 million for the Health and Hospitals System.

19

Yet, if I understand the preliminary budget they

20

gave us, their reduction in expenditures was about

21

$3.5 million.

22

is?

23
24

Can you explain what the difference

Why you have a higher number than they did?
MS. GIBSON:

My number is relative to the

preliminary forecast the President issued at the end
________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

of June.

I believe that the Health System's

2

document highlighted some changes year over year --

3

highlighted some areas of reduction.

4

very much a mathematical comparison to what we

5

thought we would have to spend at the time of the

6

preliminary budget.
COMMISSIONER SUFFREDIN:

7

But mine was

Again, I will ask

8

you in writing to reconcile the differences between

9

them.

Probably when you were working on this we

10

didn't have the preliminary budget completed by

11

Health and Hospitals.

12

year than you are, then we should understand that in

13

looking at it.

If they are using a different

The $14.4 million in savings on health

14
15

and pharmacy.

Two point two of that is the issue

16

that we were talking about with part-timers; is that

17

correct?

18

MS. GIBSON:

That is correct.

19

COMMISSIONER SUFFREDIN:

Can you just

20

explain how we are saving the remainder of that, the

21

other $12 million?
MS. GIBSON:

22

Sure.

A significant piece of

23

that had to do with negotiating improved premium

24

rates.

During July and August, Risk Management

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 21

1

actually was working on negotiating those rates

2

down.

That was about $8 million of it.
We also are taking advantage of a

3
4

number of programs in our pharmacy benefits,

5

including specialty drug management, something

6

called "rare care management", which is a disease

7

management for the most serious conditions.
We also are requiring certification of

8

Could you also look at the SelfIt seems to have an increase of

MS. GIBSON:

Again, the $14 million number

20

was what we thought we would have to spend in 2014.

21

At the time of the preliminary budget, we had a

22

number of pressures on our health benefits,

23

including some fees that we will have to pay under

24

the Affordable Care Act.

We were able to keep the

increase that low because of those actions we took.
COMMISSIONER SUFFREDIN:

2
3

couple of questions.

Let me ask Ivan a

Thank you.

Ivan, we are getting barraged by

4
5

people who are concerned about the courthouse

6

parking that is beginning to be implemented.

7

is the status of this?

8

to be?

How effective is this going

MR. SAMSTEIN:

9

What

That is a fair question.

10

you know, it is an issue from several years ago.

11

There has been a fair amount of work on that.

As

You will note that there is a number

12
13

in the budget.

14

talk about the specifics on that number and where we

15

are.

16

assuming there is the implementation moving forward

17

from an initiative of several years ago.

18

I am actually going to let Andrea

But you are right.

MS. GIBSON:

In this budget, we are

The initiative that you are

19

referring to is charging for parking at the

20

courthouses.

21

of negotiating with a vendor and will be coming to

22

the Board later this year with that.

23
24

The Capital Planning is in the process

At the same time, HR has started
discussions with the various unions that might be
________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

affected.
We do expect nine months of revenue in

2
3

this budget or $2.9 million.
COMMISSIONER SUFFREDIN:

4

I am glad you

5

mentioned the unions.

The unions have come to a

6

number of us and said that the Administration is

7

saying that it cannot negotiate over the parking

8

issue.

9

issue of collective bargaining, and it certainly

It seems to me the parking issue is a good

10

should be covered under State law.

11

bring forth an amendment at the next County Board

12

meeting to say that this is a subject matter of

13

collective bargaining.

14

of the parking versus other things we might be able

15

to get in that collective bargaining probably are

16

significant to us.

17

I intend to

It seems to me that the cost

I just want you to know that the

18

unions feel there has been refusal to negotiate on

19

it based upon memoranda that they were given by the

20

outside counsel who are representing the County.

21
22
23
24

I think that is enough for now.

Thank

you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you both.
CHAIRMAN DALEY:

Just as a reminder, as you

submit the questions we will post them.

When you

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 24

1

receive your answers, we request that you provide

2

them to us and we will post them online as well.

3

But it is your responsibility to make sure that the

4

department or the elected official does respond to

5

you.

6
7

Commissioner Collins.
COMMISSIONER COLLINS:

My line of

8

questioning is basically the same.

I am going to

9

indicate in writing some more specific things as it

10

relates to the grants.

11

that we are receiving more grants.

12

the things that I have talked about, and I know

13

Commissioner Sims has been talking about it since I

14

have been here.

15

grants, looking at the other counties, and where is

16

the money that they are receiving and we are not?

17

I am gratified, in a sense,
That is one of

How do we reach out to get more

We are improving in that vein, but on

18

the other hand, we really need to put some checks

19

and balances there so that when a grant runs out,

20

and we are hiring people in those places, in

21

addition to that, all of the grants that we have to

22

put up a match up.

23

going to manage to keep that under control?

24

Where are we and how are we

The Commissioner's questions are very
________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 25

1

on point to me.
The other thing that I still have not

2
3

realized, even with all he said in the questions

4

that he raised, and that is about Homeland Security

5

and the Land Bank.

6

why we have to use any grants for the Land Bank.

7

thought it was a separate entity.

I

We need to also look at just what kind

8
9

I can't see, for the life of me,

of entity we have as it relates to Cook County -- I

10

can't think of it -- what is the name of the

11

department that it is called?

12

department of justice that receives the grants for

13

us?

The Cook County

The girl that receives the grants.

14

CHAIRMAN DALEY:

Judicial Advisory.

15

COMMISSIONER COLLINS:

Yes.

The Judicial

16

Advisory Council.

17

remember, but when you get older you forget names.

18

I forget the names.

19

How that fits into it -- I do

There is no doubt of that.

We need to look at that.

We need to

20

understand deeper what is their role and

21

responsibility.

22

take money that goes directly to your agency for

23

employment that flows through a private agency, then

24

it goes to provide service, that is a bit much for

It seems to me that when you can

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

me.
I want those questions answered.

2
3

CHAIRMAN DALEY:

4

COMMISSIONER GORMAN:

5

Commissioner Gorman.
Thank you, Chairman

Daley, and thank you, Andrea, for your presentation.
My question is along grant lines.

6

A

7

larger issue in the past budgets is obviously we

8

don't get enough grant money into our budget.

9

obviously, we have to cover the deficits from

10

taxation.

11

and they are actually being infused.

It is great that the grant are out there,

My question is the estimated revenue

12
13

on the grants.

14

That is an increase over and above what it was

15

originally; is that correct?

16

Then,

It says a twenty percent change.

MS. GIBSON:

That's right.

It compares

17

2013's grants to what we expect in 2014.

18

big increase.

19

that number closer to $200 million over the next

20

five years.

21

direction.

22
23
24

It is a

I think our goal internally is to get

But we are headed in the right

COMMISSIONER GORMAN:

That's wonderful.

That is twenty percent.
Is there a way -- it's alright if you
________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 27

1

don't have it now -- to get an itemization of how it

2

is being allocated?

3

the revenues.
MS. GIBSON:

4

It is showing thirty percent of

Grants stay within the grants.

5

It is not allocated to the General Fund.

6

think maybe what you are asking is what areas?
COMMISSIONER GORMAN:

7
8
9

But I

Yes, like Homeland

Security?
MS. GIBSON:

Yes.

In volume one there is a

10

grants overview section that provides a summary of

11

the grants by area.

12

healthcare -- that will give you a good overview of

13

what is included.

14
15

It summarizes public safety,

COMMISSIONER GORMAN:
is what I am looking for?

16

MS. GIBSON:

17

COMMISSIONER GORMAN:

20
21

Yes.
Thank you.

It seems like you know this book

18
19

The summary of grants

pretty well.
MS. GIBSON:

I have gotten to know it

pretty well.

22

COMMISSIONER GORMAN:

23

CHAIRMAN DALEY:

24

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

Thank you.

Commissioner Gainer.
Good morning, and to

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 28

1

everyone, thank you for all of the work.

2

very nice presentation.

3

that went into it.

This is a

I appreciate everything

I have a couple of questions.

4

I have

5

one overall, when Commissioner Suffredin was asking

6

about the breakdown of grants and where it is.
In our budget presentation with the

7
8

President, I had asked you if we would be coming

9

prepared, if the departments would be coming

10

prepared with a breakdown of how much of their

11

budget was grants, how much of their budget was

12

Corporate Fund, and how much of their budget was

13

fees.

Are they going to be prepared to discuss

14

that?

And, if they don't work for the President,

15

are you going to be prepared to illuminate some of

16

that for us?

17

MS. GIBSON:

Yes.

The Judicial Advisory

18

Council is distributing, I think, right now some of

19

the information that you requested.

20

was specific to public safety, but you mean for

21

everybody?

22

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

Yes.

I thought it

When the Clerk

23

of the Court comes, or when Homeland Security comes

24

-- where do we hear the youth jobs?

Is that even

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 29

1

covered in this budget?

2

goes to the City agency?
MS. GIBSON:

3
4

Or is that a line item that

If you are referring to One

Summer Chicago -COMMISSIONER GAINER:

5

No.

I am referring

6

to the larger collaborative that Karin Norington-

7

Reeves runs.
MS. GIBSON:

8
9
10

She doesn't appear during the

budget process, but Herman Brewer is the liaison
there, I think, with Economic Development.
COMMISSIONER GAINER:

11

Do we have a line

12

item that we give them money, but we actually as the

13

Board don't have any oversight into what they are

14

doing?
MS. GIBSON:

15

We do not give them money.

16

They get grants, the WIA grants.

17

grants.

18

Fund.

20

talk about youth jobs?
MS. GIBSON:

21
22
23
24

It is not supported at all by the General

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

19

Reeves?

All of it is

Does anyone come and

No?
Through Karin Norington-

Not to my knowledge.
COMMISSIONER GAINER:

So as far as any

youth job oversight by the County -- I am just
________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 30

1

trying to understand because I have questions on

2

that.

3

topic or no?

4
5
6
7
8
9

Is there any forum for us to engage on that

CHAIRMAN DALEY:

Commissioner, Karin has

appeared here.
COMMISSIONER GAINER:

When she ran POET, is

that right?
CHAIRMAN DALEY:
double-check on this.

Correct.

I want to

I thought she was here last

10

year during the department presentation, which would

11

be under Herman Brewer.

12

here, but I will double-check.

13

because I want to make sure that the elected, as an

14

example, when the State's Attorney does appear you

15

would like to know from someone what percent of

16

their budget is grant-funded; is that correct?

I am pretty sure she was

17

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

18

CHAIRMAN DALEY:

19
20

I want to go back

Yes.

Would the State's Attorney

know this?
MS. GIBSON:

They will soon.

In the

21

budget, if you look at the State's Attorney, if you

22

look at volume two in Section D, it does provide an

23

overview on the very first page.

24

they are funded from the Public Safety Fund; how

It shows how much

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 31

1

much is the Special Purpose Fund; and each of the

2

grants; and how much funding that provides.
COMMISSIONER GAINER:

3

I just wanted to kind

4

of get -- what I am trying to get is some sort of

5

relative value.

6

percent on grants and sixty percent on grants, it

7

gives us a sense of potentially, as we discussed in

8

our meeting, what is the volatility for this type of

9

department.

10

If somebody is relying eighty

If you think of a red - green - yellow,

we need to be on this as the County.

11

To Commissioner Suffredin's point --

12

you have something that ceases midyear for lots of

13

things.

Government shutdown, changes in the State

14

budget.

Where are we more vulnerable because of a

15

larger portion of somebody's budget's reliance?

16

understand you have a limited ability to influence

17

how separately-electeds report their information to

18

us.

19

But it is more the idea of -- are we kind of

20

watching this overall, especially for departments

21

that rely on the Corporate Fund, for which we would

22

step in.

23
24

I

I can certainly add these things up on my own.

MS. GIBSON:

I think part of your answer to

the question is in the book.

This shows the State's

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 32

1

Attorney has $118 million available to them, or part

2

of the recommendation, and $20 million of that is

3

grants.

4

question, which is -- how likely is it that these

5

grants will be renewed and what is in jeopardy; that

6

kind of thing.

It doesn't speak to the other part of your

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

7

Especially for the

8

departments that are actually County departments.

9

That is a useful thing for us to understand.

Even

10

if it is a high-level analysis, it kind of gives us

11

-- to Commissioner Suffredin's point -- where are we

12

potentially at greater risk?
If someone can get back to me --

13

CHAIRMAN DALEY:

14

I will.

We are looking it

15

up now.

Will you inform all of the electeds to be

16

ready for this?

17

because this is the first they have heard about it.

I am asking the Budget Director

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

18
19

nodding.

20

jobs or youth employment?

21

I just saw Matt

No one comes to talk to us about youth

Is there a forum during this process

for the Board to ask questions?

18

to understand.

It would be helpful

That would be great.

19

Ivan, can you give us a general sense

20

of the Cook County debt obligations in light of our

21

recent downgrade?

22

could you kind of give us a succinct answer?

23
24

I know it was referenced, but

MR. SAMSTEIN:

Absolutely.

Commissioner,

Cook County has roughly $3.7 billion in bonds
________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 34

outstanding.

Of that, roughly $3.1 billion is

2

general obligation fixed rate debt.

3

million is sales tax fixed rate debt.

impact to the County from the downgrade.

facilities that support the bonds.

It is in the

I think from our perspective, though,

15
16

we are obviously very intently discussing our

17

financial position with the rating agencies, with

18

investors, with banks, creditors, and market

19

participants.
You are absolutely right.

20

The

21

downgrade has affected the County from Moody's, but

22

also the downgrades affect other governmental bodies

23

in the area.

24

2

It is something we clearly watch as it relates to

our position in the capital markets.

4

I will ask you this

question, and then I would like a follow-up in

6

writing.

7

rolls off and when do we need to renew going

8

forward?

What is the calendar as the fixed debt

Anything in the next six months?
MR. SAMSTEIN:

We are eying several

refinancing opportunities.

12

bonds.

13

coupons with lower cost debt and saving the

taxpayers money.

nature, we still see very significant savings.

16

Those are two transactions that we are eying very

17

significantly.

18

We would not change the

Those are simply replacing 5% and 5.25%

Because they are very short in

Beyond that, as maturities come back,

19

our intent continues to be to pay those off as

20

maturities come up.

21

there is no restructuring anticipated in this budget

22

in any way, shape, or form.

23

to defer any additional principal.

24

The current intent is that

Our intent would not be

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

So we aren't looking,

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 36

1

outside of refinancing to capture an opportunistic

2

rate change.

3

that roll off that we would then assume because they

4

are somewhat structural and consistent?

5

would assume that we would reissue?

There is no general obligation bonds

MR. SAMSTEIN:

6

That we

That is correct.

There is

7

none.

We will discuss it a little bit later as well

8

in terms of initiatives in the Chief Financial

Officer's Office specifically.

option and bring a recommendation to the Board

But our plan is to

21

fixed rate bonds other than opportunistic

refinancing such as you indicated.

24

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

I got it.

How does our debt obligation generally
________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 37

1

compare to other municipalities of our size, from a

2

ratio perspective so we can get -MR. SAMSTEIN:

That is a very good

question.

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

CHAIRMAN DALEY:

7

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

8

I thank you for that.

You get a star.
I was fishing.

I was

fishing.
MR. SAMSTEIN:

9

I appreciate the question

10

because it is something that we look at from several

11

different perspectives.

12

capital markets look at it.

We look at it because

In the budget document there is a tab

13
14

on financial policies.

In fact, you will note that

15

we recommend several different policies and ways to

16

look at that.
The way we look at it is both on a per

17
18

capita basis, how much debt per resident in bonded

19

debt that we have -- the Chairman is referring to

20

the fiscal forecast document which does talk about

21

this.

22

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

He thought it was a

23

good question, and he wanted to point out that I

24

could have done pre-reading, but go ahead.
________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 38

It is noted.

1

MR. SAMSTEIN:

2

I would point out that we in

3

the financial policies recommend that there are

4

limits, i.e., no more than a thousand dollars per

5

resident for a bonded debt.

That is one of several.

We also look at it as a function of

6
7

per capita.

8

assessed valuation on taxable property in the

9

County.

10

But we also look at it as relative to

That is the way the capital markets often

look at it.
Lastly, we look at it as it relates to

11
12

debt service relative to the overall budget.

13

this year's fiscal budget, it is roughly $187

14

million in debt service costs.

15

roughly a $3 billion spending plan.

In

That is relative to

It does rise, as the Chairman

16
17

indicated, in the forecast document.

It is

18

structured already to rise slowly and gradually over

19

the next several years to roughly cap out at $300

20

million.

21

percent of budget.

That still represents a relatively modest

22

I think what I would say to you, in

23

answer to how do we compare to other governmental

24

bodies -- we look at ourselves relative to national
________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 39

1

medians and local medians.

2

many local governmental bodies is slightly lower per

3

capita and relative to taxable evaluation.

4

national scale, we are slightly above national

5

medians, and it is something we will continue to

6

monitor.

Our debt relative to

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

On a

Just a clarification

8

of the question and the answer -- the other

9

departments are going to come in and talk to us?

10

CHAIRMAN DALEY:

Yes.

11

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

I am only asking my

12

question for you guys on procurement, risk

13

management, and a lot of other things.

14

specific questions on healthcare, but I actually

15

prefer to ask Risk Management.

kind of leave it there.

When you look at your deficit

projections, Andrea, I notice that we kind of talk

20

about what they are.

21

pension funding, the pension deficit?

22

keep that completely divorced when we talk about

23

deficit projections.

Do you factor in at all the

something that is a very significant indicator of

6

our long-term fiscal health because the rating

7

agencies and other bodies are looking at that.
That being said, as you know, the

8
9

statutes currently dictate a statutory payment level

10

which is the maximum not to exceed the level under

11

current law.

12

County would continue to pay its payments to the

13

separate body of the Pension Fund the maximum

14

allowed under the law, which is roughly $193 million

15

in the fiscal '14 budget.

16

The budget document assumes that the

A good point to note is that the

17

County has made the maximum payment possible under

18

law for many years, as you well know.

19

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

We don't really

20

consider this when we look overall into what the

21

County's debt status is or unfunded status.

22

it is different.

23

considering for the purposes of talking about the

24

corporate is that we can meet the $193 million?

We see

MR. SAMSTEIN:

As you know, the

Administration certainly is looking at and believes

3

a solution ultimately is needed to the pension

4

challenges.
That being said, this budget document

anticipates that the County will continue to fund

the maximum allowable under State law.

I have my other questions and I will

COMMISSIONER SIMS:

13

Fair enough.

Vice Chair Sims.
Thank you, Chairman

Daley.
Commissioner Suffredin asked about the

14
15

parking for the courthouses.

16

that function is going to work, and how are we

17

estimating our revenues from that, and has it been

18

taken into consideration?

19

CHAIRMAN DALEY:

20

COMMISSIONER SIMS:

I am interested in how

From the revenues.
I heard some rumors

21

that it is going to be tied to an employee paycheck,

22

that the money is going to come out of their

23

paycheck every month to pay for parking; is that

24

correct?
________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 42

MS. GIBSON:

1
2

A couple of answers.

There

were a couple of questions in there.
We budgeted for $2.9 million, assuming

3
4

nine months, that this would start in March.

5

believe at the Health System, where employees pay

6

for parking, they have the option to have it

7

deducted automatically from their paycheck.

8

Certainly that would be available to employees as

9

well.

I believe they would have to sign up for

10

that.

It wouldn't be an automatic.

11

But in terms of how the parking

12

operation will actually work, I will defer to

13

Capital Planning, who has been working with a

14

vendor.
COMMISSIONER SIMS:

15

I

My concern is with the

16

employees.

If it is going to be payroll deducted,

17

what if an employee is on vacation?

18

employee is sick?

19

are they going to be paying for days that they are

20

not there?

21

have so many coupons you can buy?

22

think, would be a better way to do this.

23

many coupons in a month, and allow them to roll

24

over.

What if an

And, if it is payroll-deducted,

Is it going to be a coupon, like you
Which to me, I
You buy so

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 43

Let's just say an employee says, "I

1
2

don't want it payroll-deducted.

3

coming.

4

know a lot of people, and I know an employee

5

wouldn't want to pay for parking and they are not

6

going to be there.

7

million, have you taken that into consideration?

8

is it going to be a flat fee regardless of whether

9

you park or not?

I am going to be gone for two weeks."

Or

I would assume we will be

11

tracking however we handle the Health System

12

parking.

13

back to you with the detail on that.

14

that at my fingertips.

If it is okay, Commissioner, if I can get

COMMISSIONER SIMS:

15

I

When you factor in that $2

MS. GIBSON:

10

I have got vacation

I don't have

Think about a coupon

16

process as well.

Were you thinking about that?

17

Let's just say somebody has a situation where they

18

know they are not going to be there, and they may

19

say, "I am not going to be there.

20

pay for parking while I am not there.

21

over?"

22

are banking on this $2 million.

23

were very conservative in your estimates.

24

that maybe you may not get the $2 million that you

I don't want to

Take those into consideration.

Can it roll

ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 44

1

are expecting because of that.

2

MS. GIBSON:

3

We will take a look at that,

Commissioner.
COMMISSIONER SIMS:

4

My other question is --

5

I am looking at your 2014 revenues versus expenses.

6

This is where it says, "Where our dollars go."

7

it is only 0.8% that we are putting into economic

8

development.

9

throughout the County.

And

I guess those are for projects

How much revenue do we get for

10
11

economic development?

12

Are we getting less in 2014 than we got in 2013?

13

we know that?

We won't know that until

15

later; but the CDBG is declining over the years.

16

You have seen it here.

17

brought to the Board is declining.

Each year the amount that is

Back to your first question -- any

18
19

grants, like CDBG or Home, or NSP; those would be

20

part of what is included in the economic

21

development, 0.8%.
COMMISSIONER SIMS:

22

Do

Or we won't know that until March?

MS. GIBSON:

14

I guess that is through CDBG.

What was the total

23

revenue in 2013 for economic development for CDBG

24

and Home?
________________________________________________

CHAIRMAN DALEY:

Is that the grant?

2

COMMISSIONER SIMS:

3

MS. GIBSON:

Yes -- what is that.

Yes -- I am looking in volume

4

one on page ninety-seven.

This shows what is the

5

approved budget for CDBG.

We have about $9 million

6

in there for CDBG.

over $10 million the prior year.

16

now are going for other things, as far as the

17

agencies applying for funding to work their

18

programs, as opposed to the way we used to just fund

19

CDBG, strictly for infrastructure.

Here is the problem that I find in
We used to use our

A lot of those funds I understand

Does the Federal Government have

20
21

another grant avenue for infrastructure?

In the

22

south suburbs, there is a declining infrastructure.

23

Streets, roads -- I know because I am Chairman of

24

Highways.

We got money that we can use, but that is

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 46

1

not enough.

2

using that strictly for streets -- maybe water

3

repair or pipes or whatever -- if those dollars are

4

declining, how are we going to help them and how are

5

we able to bring businesses in, if we are not able

6

to find funding to help them with their

7

infrastructure?

8
9

If you have a municipality that is

MS. GIBSON:

Commissioner, if you remember

last year, the Department of Highways is renamed to

10

"Department of Highways and Transportation".

It

11

wasn't just that they liked the name better.

It was

12

based on the idea that they would be eligible for

13

more grant funds.

14

have an opportunity in getting additional grants to

15

address exactly what you are talking about with the

16

infrastructure needs.

17

That is an area where we think we

COMMISSIONER SIMS:

What you are saying is:

18

in the future that is going to shift, probably from

19

CDBG to Highways.

20

Will there be a shift?

MS. GIBSON:

I don't know if I would call

21

it a shift.

But I would say that CDBG will probably

22

continue to decline a little bit every year.

23

our goal and intent to increase the amount of funds

24

coming to Highways.

It is

So as CDBG Federal funds

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 47

1

decline, we would plan to get more grants for

2

Highways and Transportation.

3

COMMISSIONER SIMS:

I would suggest in

4

March, when we go to the legislative meetings in

5

Washington, through NaCO -- I know there was a time

6

a couple of years ago where there was a fight to

7

stop the decline of CDBG dollars.

8

be in the forefront of that because we do have

9

communities like Harvey, Markham, Phoenix, Ford

I think we should

10

Heights, that need those CDBG dollars.

11

should be in the forefront of fighting for those

12

communities.

13

I think we

Detroit should be fighting.

All of

14

those communities.

15

largest in the country, we should be trying to band

16

together with maybe some other States and county-

17

elected officials to talk to our legislators to try

18

to see if we can get more funding for CDBG.

19

that is going to be major, because if those dollars

20

continue to decline, Cook County and those

21

communities are really going to be in a real bind.

22

I would hope we do that.

23
24

Cook County, being the second

I think

I am sorry to see that only eight
percent is going out.

When I first got here, we had

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 48

1

lots of CDBG dollars to help those communities, not

2

only in the south, but in the western suburbs as

3

well.

Those are my questions.
MS. GIBSON:

4

Commissioner, I might add that

5

CDBG is one of the formula grants.

It is formula-

6

drive, based on census data and things like that.
I think there is opportunity in

7
8

increasing Federal grants.

I just don't know if we

9

could have an impact on the formula.

10

COMMISSIONER SIMS:

We all know that the

11

people -- if it is census-driven, we all know people

12

in Cook County -- we did not put the money into the

13

census that we should have put into the census to

14

really get our numbers.

15

showing for Cook County are definitely not true.

16

They are far less than they should be.

17

is the reason, if it is driven by census, then we

18

should try to figure out how we can go back.

19

at one time you could go back and do the correction.

20

Are we too late to go back to do those corrections

21

to try to capture some of the dollars?
CHAIRMAN DALEY:

22
23
24

The numbers that they are

Yes.

So if that

Definitely.

I know

It's

CHAIRMAN DALEY:

The census, as you know,

2

is based upon the remaps and everything else.

3

few years, we will be on the new one.

4

declining each year, and the Administration and

5

Congress has declined it.

6

COMMISSIONER SIMS:

In a

It has been

We fought it for a

7

couple of years ago, and we didn't lose as much

8

money, and they did put some money back.

9

hoping that this year that we will fight to maybe

I am

10

capture some more, not to lose any more, or get less

11

than we got last year.

12

CHAIRMAN DALEY:

It is a difficult issue,

13

but, again, it is all driven by cuts.

14

COMMISSIONER SIMS:

Maybe we should team up

15

with some other States that really have the decline

16

that we are having in some of their communities to

17

see if we can band together and make it a big issue

18

and try to capture some more dollars.

19

the Federal Government doesn't have any money, but

20

they can find money for stupid stuff.

call.

COMMISSIONER SILVESTRI:

8
9

You were here.
On page nine, it

indicates that the total budget has a percent change

10

of 6.5.

11

described earlier, in terms of aggressive

12

refinancing or opportunistic, I think you said,

13

refinancing?

14

Is this made up by the thing that you

How would you summarize the difference

15

between a 6.5% increase in spending or change in

16

spending as opposed to not an increase in revenue?

17
18

MR. SAMSTEIN:

I would explain it,

Commissioner, in a couple of ways.

19

I think the important point is that

20

the Corporate and Public Safety Fund increased by

21

roughly 3.3%, net of a number of external mandates.

22

It actually is an increase around two percent, or

23

slightly less than the projected rate of inflation.

24

COMMISSIONER SILVESTRI:

The two percent --

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 51

1

excuse me for interrupting -- the two percent is the

2

increase that is needed because of the Justice

3

Department and things like that?

4

MR. SAMSTEIN:

No.

I apologize.

The 3.3%

5

is the total increase in spending in the Corporate

6

and Public Safety Funds.

7

COMMISSIONER SILVESTRI:

8

MR. SAMSTEIN:

9

Each?

Each; in the aggregate.

If

you net out that external mandate, that is about

10

1.3%.

It leaves about a two-percent differential,

11

which we would note is less than inflation.

12

Much of the increase in spending that

13

does occur happens in the health enterprise system.

14

That is largely a function of spending.

15

number of facts, but the predominant one is related

16

to providing additional services for primary care

17

and patients under CountyCare.

18

spending money to generate those additional revenues

19

under the CountyCare program.

It is effectively

COMMISSIONER SILVESTRI:

20
21

increase.

22

fees?

There are a

There is a revenue

It is just not in the form of taxes and

23

MR. SAMSTEIN:

That is correct.

24

COMMISSIONER SILVESTRI:

With respect to

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 52

1

the CDBG program, the amount of funding coming from

2

Congress is reduced -- from Washington is reduced.

3

But the criteria to apply for and receive the funds

4

is not changed; is that correct?
MS. GIBSON:

5

That's right.

It is formula-

6

driven.

7

opportunity is to talk to the Federal Government

8

about the total amount and how the formula is --

9

what the total pot of money is for CDBG.
COMMISSIONER SILVESTRI:

10
11

I think where we have a potential

Commissioner Moore.
COMMISSIONER MOORE:

I was looking at

me why we zeroed out the department's request?

that because it is not up and functioning and

COMMISSIONER MOORE:

10

Could you explain to
Is

Yes.
Still, we requested

nineteen new positions?
MR. SAMSTEIN:

11

Commissioner, we will be

12

discussing the ERP in greater detail in a moment.

13

But the answer to your question specifically is the

14

ERP projects are expected to last ten years or

15

greater and are viewed as capital equipment and

16

capital-eligible expenses.

17

paying those expenses from existing bond proceeds on

18

hand.

19

So we are, in fact,

The positions are zeroed out, not

20

because they are new hires, but because the

21

appropriation from the operating budget is

22

effectively zeroed out because we do in fact

23

reimburse those expenses from capital dollars.

MS. GIBSON:

We went

We do have some operating expenses

We have that in fixed charges.
We expect over the next several years,

as we move from implementing a capital program to

having it just maintained, that some of the

resources will shift form capital to operating.

implement the countywide time and attendance?

When

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

2

will it be up and running?
MR. SAMSTEIN:

There are several different

3

ones, Prasad Nettem will be one of several

4

department directors who will come up and discuss

5

his three initiatives.

6

for time and attendance is to bring a contract to

7

the Board by the end of the year for the time and

8

attendance.

9

is generally, roughly an eighteen-month time frame

10

But, basically, the intent

After the Board approves a contract, it

to implement it.
The intent is that certain pilot

11
12

agencies to be determined during this year, one

13

large and one small, will be implemented during

14

fiscal '14.

15

get the entire County implemented after we bring a

contract to the Board.

17

the end of the year.

18

But it is roughly eighteen months to

Our intent is to do so by

COMMISSIONER MOORE:

So our countywide time

19

and attendance project, will it be similar to the

20

one that the City has where you can swipe in here at

21

this office and swipe out at 69 West?

22

MR. SAMSTEIN:

That is the intent,

23

particularly I think in the Health System, for

24

instance, where you have physicians who may show up
________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 58

at a different facility.

I think that is definitely

one of the criteria that an individual would have

term -- first, how long it is going to take to ramp

14

up to that.

anything that we apply to debt service is less we

can expend on a yearly basis to supply services

17

directly to our constituents.

18

My question is:

Maybe you can describe the

No, absolutely.

blanks.
MR. SAMSTEIN:

Absolutely -- the debt

service is currently $187.4 million.

So the answer

2

is:

3

in capital spending.

4

outstanding bonds that have already been issued by

5

the County.

No, there is no function of a dramatic ramp-up
This is actually related to

In 2010 and 2009 the County issued

6
7

roughly $686 million in new-money debt.

Via the

8

restructuring in 2011, some of the impact of that

9

was deferred for several years.

But, ultimately,

10

the debt service does escalate to about $300 million

11

from outstanding debt.

12

You are absolutely right.

As debt

13

service costs increase, they will reduce the general

14

property taxes that are available to the General

15

Fund.

16

roughly $35 to $40 million in year-over-year impact,

17

over several years; including the impact of the

18

Election Fund.

19

available to the General Fund every year.

The intent -- and what we are looking at is

It also reduces property tax

In roughly 2027 it stabilizes around

20
21

$300 million.

The final term of the County debt is

22

2034.

23

outstanding debt.

24

$300 million figure for a period of time before

It is sort of stabilized at that

I hope I answered your question

2
3

sufficiently, Commissioner.
COMMISSIONER SCHNEIDER:

4

You did very well.

5

The $300 million is the level plateau until 2034.

6

Do you anticipate any need to go out and purchase

7

additional bonds in the foreseeable future?
MR. SAMSTEIN:

8
9

In the 2014 budget, we do

not anticipate the issuance of new money debt.

I

10

think it is safe to say, based on the infrastructure

11

needs of the County, both in capital equipment and

12

capital improvements over time, there will be new

13

money needs.

14

have to come up with a plan to fund those new money

15

needs and any additional debts to finance the long-

16

term projects.

I think in each budget year we will

COMMISSIONER SCHNEIDER:

17

And, in doing so,

18

you won't increase that $300 million to something

19

higher than that?
MR. SAMSTEIN:

20

That would obviously be the

21

goal.

I think candidly it will be challenging to do

22

so.

23

to funding infrastructure, it is definitely one that

24

we spend a lot of time thinking about the best and

I think when we talk about long-term challenges

most efficient way to finance these capital projects

2

and the infrastructure costs over the long run.
So, yes, there is a possibility that

4

additional debt could reduce further operating

dollars available to the General Fund.

uncommon to see capital funds used for salaries.

MR. SAMSTEIN:

It is very

22

taxes on bond proceeds, specifically in this case,

23

predominantly are what we call "Build America Bonds"

24

from several years ago.

That is what I just

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 62

1

referred to.

The IRS governing rules dictate and

2

govern the ability to use those for capital

3

projects.

4

a county and for other entities.

It is actually a very common practice for

You are absolutely right.

5

We don't

6

pay salaries out of bond proceeds, except when the

7

individuals are one hundred percent dedicated to a

8

specific long-duration capital project that is

9

eligible under the IRS guidelines.

When those

10

individuals are solely one hundred percent dedicated

11

to that project, the County has historically used

12

bond proceeds to pay for that capital project.

13

includes the salaries for the individuals, during

14

the development on a technology project or during

15

the construction period for construction.

16

COMMISSIONER FRITCHEY:

That

qualifies the folks dedicated to your project; they

then, no.

During the development

Once the project is built, so to speak,

COMMISSIONER FRITCHEY:

Then at some point

salaries have to be transferred somewhere else?

MR. SAMSTEIN:

That is correct.

That is

what Andrea referred to that over time, if the

COMMISSIONER TOBOLSKI:

CHAIRMAN DALEY:

22

COMMISSIONER COLLINS:

No, sir.

Commissioner Collins.
I would like for you

23

to be able to -- I guess you can clarify this for me

24

because I am not clearly understanding just where we
________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 64

1

are as it relates to our bond rating; what you are

2

saying we may have to do in terms of issuing bonds.
It is my understanding that we were

3
4

issuing bonds because we had a serious pension

5

deficit.

6

anything else because we had not been paying the

7

bills, our share, into the Pension Fund.

Our deficits in pensions were greater than

8

It was also my understanding that we

9

were not incurring additional debt service because

10

we were restructuring our bonds and lowering the

11

interest rates.

12

balance off our debt.

13

From that savings, it would sort of

I want to know, over the last four

14

years, what has our bond rating dropped to from

15

where we are now?

16

MR. SAMSTEIN:

Commissioner, a couple of

17

points that I will just mention.

18

existing bond debt service is generally related to

19

capital projects.

20

Pension Fund, it is important that the County has,

21

in fact, been paying the statutory maximum allowed

22

under State law to pay.

23

24

capital projects, some self-insurance funding, and

The County's

As it relates to the County

The bond proceeds, which

ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 65

not related to pension costs.

2

that clarification.

3

I do want to make

But, as it relates to our bond rating,

4

our bond ratings are currently A1, with a negative

5

outlook from Moody's Investors Service; AA, with a

6

stable outlook from Standard & Poor's; and AA- from

7

Fitch Ratings, also with a negative outlook.

8

There was a downgrade, as you alluded

9

to, from Moody's Investors Service which was an AA3

10

rating previously, and they did downgrade that

11

rating this summer from AA3 to A1.

12

COMMISSIONER COLLINS:

It was also my

13

understanding that this administration was doing a

14

good job on A, balancing our budget, cutting back

15

and saving money on all of our purchases.

16

saying we saved this amount of money; we saved that

17

amount of money.

18

top of it, the Health Systems, the additional money

19

coming in from the waiver and a combination of

20

things that leads me to believe that the Health

21

System's Board will be able to fund itself without

22

having to rely on anything coming basically from the

23

County or using any of our money to subsidize the

24

General Fund for the operation of the overall County

complaints that the process is very slow.

Have you

15

found that in terms of revenue collection?

This is

a big county, with a lot of places that have video

Yes.

Good morning, Zahra.

Good morning.
The budget estimates

for the alcohol tax did not meet expectations in the

past four or five revenue reports.

have inquired, and your response has been that this

is under review.
MS. ALI:

I and others

Where are we with the review?
For the current, not the

projections -- we have undertaken a look at all our

13

distributors and suppliers who are registered with

15

will be undertaking as well.

We have identified particular audits that we

2

Yes, in compliance with the

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

3

Based on your earlier

reviews, do you think that there are people who are

5

not complying with the ordinance and that you are

6

going to audit them?
MS. ALI:

7

We are.

They are in our fiscal

8

year 2014 audit plan.

We have some wholesalers and

9

distributors that are already under way.

10

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

11

will make up the consistent shortfall?
MS. ALI:

12

Do you think that

We believe so.

That is why in

13

2014 we have not increased our estimates.

14

believe that we would make up the revenue loss, and

15

then hopefully with bringing the wholesalers and

16

distributors in compliance, and in addition to our

17

retail compliance, to ensure that all retail

18

establishments in Cook County are buying their

alcohol products from registered wholesalers and

distributors, and not from out-of-state, out-of-

21

County.

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

We

Are you in

collaboration with the City and other municipalities

on the later effort with the retailers?

additional funds, Commissioner.

know, the court process will continue to play out.

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

Commissioner Gainer.

10

MS. ZALAS:

11

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

Hello, Deanna.

Hello.
What is the status of

12

negotiating our Blue Cross/Blue Shield contract for

13

this year?

14

reflect the $14 million in savings -- $12 million in

15

savings?

16

Has that been completed?

MS. ZALAS:

Correct.

And does that

The Blue Cross/Blue

17

Shield, the healthcare savings alone was close to $5

18

million over their preliminary rate that they

19

proposed in July, to what we were able to negotiate

20

for the renewal that will go into effect 12/1.

21

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

I am trying to get to

22

the baseline of where we are.

23

2013 budget to the 2014 budget, how much did we

24

actually reduce our spending?

How much from the

What I heard before

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 91

1

is that we thought it was going to be higher.

2

wasn't that high so we are counting that as savings.

3

What did we pay in 2013?

4

in 2014?

What are we going to pay

And, thus, what are the savings?
MS. ZALAS:

5

It

Certainly.

The $14.4 million

6

that Andrea referenced earlier is related to savings

7

over the preliminary budget.

8

expectation.
COMMISSIONER GAINER:

9
10

That was the

That was the number

that we put out there?

11

MS. ZALAS:

Correct.

12

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

We put a number out

13

there, then it was lower, so we are counting that as

14

savings?

15

MS. ZALAS:

Part of the $14.4 included the

16

preliminary rates of Blue Cross/Blue Shield.

17

is real savings in the renewal process with Blue

18

Cross that was reduced by five.

19

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

There

Again, Deanna, what

20

are we spending in 2013?

21

is what we didn't spend; not what we thought we

22

might spend and then didn't

23
24

MS. GIBSON:
Commissioner.

What I consider a savings

If I can chime in here,

For 2013 we had budgeted $278.7

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 92

1

million in the Self-Insurance Fund.

2

budgeted at $280.8 million.

3

year over year.

For 2014 it is

So there is an increase

Typically, you know, health benefits

4
5

will increase seven or eight percent every year.

6

Part of the information that we had at the

7

preliminary budget indicated a larger increase.

8

we were successful in reducing that.
COMMISSIONER GAINER:

9

But

The national health

10

increase rates, as opposed to the last seven years,

11

are lower or the lowest that they have been.

12

am trying to get to is last year we spent $278

13

million.

14

We are spending an additional $2 million on

15

healthcare?

16
17
18

This year we are spending $280 million.

MS. GIBSON:

If by last year you mean 2013

and this year 2014, yes.
COMMISSIONER GAINER:

19

2013 budget we spent $278.

20

spent $280.

21

healthcare benefits?

22

MS. GIBSON:

23

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

24

What I

So last year in the

In the 2014 budget we

So we have a $2 million increase in

Correct.
What are the actual

savings that we are saving on healthcare?

I

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 93

1

understand trend rates and all that good stuff.

I

2

appreciate all of the good negotiating that you guys

3

did.

4

numbers are.

I am trying to get to actually what these

MR. SAMSTEIN:

5

If I could, Commissioner.

I

6

would also point out that the increase is roughly $2

7

million.

8

new taxes and fees associated with the Affordable

9

Care Act that are embedded.

10

I would just point that

out as well.
COMMISSIONER GAINER:

11
12

But that incorporates the $7 million in

"Securus" and how much was the reinsurance?

13

MS. ZALAS:

14

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

15

MS. ZALAS:

16
17

$3.4.

"Securus" was $.1 million.
So it is $100,000?

The traditional reinsurance is

The health industry fee was $3.6.
COMMISSIONER GAINER:

18

industry fee the actual ACA?

19

that Blue Cross charged us?

20

How much was

MS. ZALAS:

Is the health
Or is that something

That is a charge to Blue Cross

21

that is passed through to the employer.

22

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

23

employer was $3.5 million.

24

some of their costs at $3.6.

So our cost as an

Blue Cross passed on

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 94

1

MS. ZALAS:

$7.1 is what we are looking at.

2

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

Last year we paid

3

$278.

We had an additional outside expenditure,

4

which we knew was coming, but outside of our control

5

of $7.1 and our new spend is $280.

6

any potential actual reduction in healthcare, it is

7

about $5 million?

8

MS. ZALAS:

9

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

So if there was

Yes.
The difference

10

between the $5 million and the $12 million that we

11

are talking about saving is just because we pegged

12

to the number higher; then it was lower.

13

higher numbers were all of our doing?
MS. ZALAS:

14

No.

But those

That is incorrect.

The

15

higher number also included the preliminary rates of

16

Blue Cross and Blue Shield.

17

preliminary rates, which we received in July, to the

18

final rates that are uploaded for the 12/1 planned

19

year, there was about a $3.5 million reduction.

So between their

Some of that was related to the

20
21

Affordable Care Act, the reduction in the fees that

22

Blue Cross estimated that they would be passing on

23

to us.

24

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

So that $3.6 million

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 95

1

fee they thought was going to be higher?
MS. ZALAS:

2

Correct.

Then the other part

3

was related to adherence to certain capitation rates

4

that had been discussed as part of last year's HMO

5

migration.

6

their early renewal offer in July.

Blue Cross failed to incorporate that in

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

7

This wasn't

8

necessarily savings to the plan.

9

misestimated, and then they also miscalculated on

10

It was they

the capitation?

11

MS. ZALAS:

That is a fair way to put it.

12

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

We saved some money

13

on healthcare.

14

say actually what that was since it was actually

15

those other two things.

16

change?

17

looked at this number a lot and I actually feel like

18

ignoring this number as we talk about retirement,

19

kind of squeeze half the retirement, because our

20

healthcare costs per employee are incredibly high,

21

as are a lot of the other municipalities.

22

are much larger than the average large employer.

Is there any substantive

As you know, and Ivan as well, I have

But they

I understand all of the things that

23
24

Of the $5 million -- it is hard to

drive that.

You didn't build that -- to quote

3

you thought was really a substantive change that you

4

thought was moving in the right direction, as far as

5

the County's costs as an employer in providing

6

healthcare?
MS. ZALAS:

7

Not related specifically to the

8

healthcare.

of it, yes.

We have a significant specialty drug

10

usage in our pharmaceutical end.

12

that will allow us to have more detailed

13

communication with the physicians who are dispensing

specialty drugs.

We have implemented certain programs

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

Caremark -- CVS is

What does that mean?

Is it like cancer drugs?
MS. ZALAS:

17

In some cases, yes.

Specialty

18

drugs are broadly defined as biodrugs.

19

require additional care, shipping, and handling.

20

They are often not dispensed from the average

21

pharmacy.

and they are very costly drugs.
COMMISSIONER GAINER:

We are not talking

about not providing them.

I am just trying to

4

understand better what is involved.

5

MS. ZALAS:

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

"lifestyle drugs".
MS. ZALAS:

Right.
You keep referring to

What is that?
Lifestyle drugs is again

another imprecise category.

We currently have

10

certain preauthorization limits for other lifestyle

11

drugs -- acne medication, for instance, weight loss

12

medication.

13

is that there is preauthorization, meaning that the

14

physician would have medical documentation with the

15

pharmacy indicating why these drugs are being used.

16

It would be categories such as erectile dysfunction

17

and "nandrolone" drugs, which is a considerable

18

spend category for us as well.

What we are adding into the requirement

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

Is that testosterone?

Yes.
So you feel

22

comfortable that we have actually achieved some

savings on real things.

for next year?

What are your aspirations

If you really thought kind of

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 98

1

goalwise, looking at where you would like to be in a

2

year, to really whether it impacted population

3

health or whether it is savings; what are the things

4

that you look for when you think about negotiating

5

with the County's healthcare benefits, or designing

6

them, I should say.

7

would we like to be as an employer?

8
9

MS. ZALAS:

Not so focused on costs.

Where

I think two things I would say.

As you know, we have a very highly unionized

10

workforce.

It is beholden on us to work closely

11

with the Labor Relations team as any discussions

12

take place regarding employee health benefits; that

13

those are plans that we can administer in an

14

efficient way.

15

that are difficult for us to administer, we would

16

like to get those out of there.

If it works in the current program

17

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

18

MS. ZALAS:

Like what?

For instance, the method by

19

which opt-out payments are provided to individual

20

employees.

21

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

If you opt out, like

22

I am not taking any of the insurance so I am getting

23

subsidized or paid?

24

MS. ZALAS:

It is a very small segment of

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 99

1

our overall population, but it is a very

2

administratively burdensome process for all of the

3

players involved.

4

we have discussed with the Labor Relations team.

5

addition to the entire plan design, what that should

6

be looking like.

Something like that is something

In terms of what else we can do

impacting the current state of affairs -- we did

bring on someone to focus primarily on wellness

ultimately they are able to achieve at the

bargaining table.
COMMISSIONER GAINER:

15

I get that.

We all

16

live within constraints of the possible.

kind of would be curious about -- you don't have to

answer it now, but I would actually like to know if

24

things that are probably found more on the self-

comfortable that they are on top of the issue, and

18

that you are on top of it?

19

MS. ZALAS:

Yes.

20

COMMISSIONER SUFFREDIN:

We would never

21

have a situation like Metra found itself in, where

22

they owned a policy and didn't activate it because

23

they didn't know they had it?

8

Because one of the prime potential users, I would

9

think, would be the 4000 employees that are in his

10

department who may want to get their healthcare at

11

the place they work, as often happens in other

12

hospital settings.

It would be a form of an

health benefit for those workers who work in those

locations?

MS. ZALAS:

We did have a conversation, a

18

couple of conversations with Doctor Raju over the

19

summer in working with the labor negotiations team

20

on what the benefit proposal would be.

21

the movement of the Health and Hospitals System to a

22

standalone HMO is still a work in progress, and

23

there is not a definitive time frame for that.

24

Certainly

My expectation would be as that

conversations about where it would fit into our

4

were authorized under our carrier, and that sort of

thing.
COMMISSIONER SUFFREDIN:

6

Keep us posted on

7

that.

I think it has some potential if he is able

8

to put that together, both in bringing patients into

9

our system, which would be essential, but also a

10

potential of capturing some of our own employees at

11

a discounted rate because of the way we could

provide the care.

MS. GIBSON:

Good morning.

Andrea Gibson,

Budget Director.
I will be brief.

I hopefully won't

repeat myself.

23

The Budget Office has a number of

24

accomplishments we would like to talk about for
________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 106

1

2013.

One is we received the GFOA award for the

2

2013 budget.

3

we are going to continue to incorporate that to

4

improve the document.

They have given us some feedback, and

I have mentioned this already, but we

5
6

do have a goal of increasing our grant funding.

7

think a lot of the comments earlier are well-

8

advised, that we are strategic about it.

9

there are resources that can be brought into the

I

I think

10

County that we currently are not accessing, as well

11

as some of the other counties.
In terms of 2014, we continue to try

12
13

to improve upon our budget process.

14

premium on timing this and being transparent about

15

the stages in the process and working with all of

16

our partners to get that done.
I guess I would open it up for

17
18

questions, for the Budget Office specifically.
CHAIRMAN DALEY:

19

Are there any questions?

Commissioner Gainer.

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

23

that?

Is that for the budget entertainment fund?
CHAIRMAN DALEY:

Yes.

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 107

MS. GIBSON:

1

There is a variety of

2

miscellaneous revenues that don't fall neatly into

3

one of the other categories of Home Rule taxes.

4

They may be -- we have some energy rebates that we

5

received based on some of the new equipment that are

6

installing, as a County, not the Budget Office,

7

obviously.
COMMISSIONER GAINER:

8
9
10

Why wouldn't those be

in Facilities so we can capture that?

If it is

about retrofits and things like that -MS. GIBSON:

11

This is miscellaneous revenue

12

that comes into the General Fund.

13

into the Budget Office.

14

Facilities.

It does help pay for

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

15

It doesn't come

I guess my question

16

is:

Why wouldn't it be in the budget of Facilities?

17

Because if they are responsible for energy and

18

retrofit, and there are savings to be garnered from

19

those things, we receive the money -- as you know, I

20

couldn't possibly be less of a fan of the contracts

21

where we were promised savings, and then we get at

22

some other point -- but not having it in the

23

department that is responsible for it makes it even

24

harder to track.
________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 108

MS. GIBSON:

1

I can respond to that.

The

2

expenditures related to implementing the energy

3

efficient equipment is within the capital

4

improvement budget.

5

some expenditures and in Facilities as well.

In Capital Planning, there are

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

6

I am not tied to

7

Facilities.

My point is -- if we have an expense,

8

then there is also revenue generated from that

9

expense, why wouldn't it be in the same place?
MS. GIBSON:

10

Because we have expenditures.

11

The expenditure budget is separated from the revenue

12

budget.

13

that support the General Fund.

14

Capital Planning or Facilities, the expenses come

15

from the General Fund.

16

support that.

17

individual departments.

We have all of the revenues listed together

There are revenues that

We don't reflect revenues by

I am not sure if I am following you.
COMMISSIONER GAINER:

I will ask Shannon,

20

21

these promises made, and whether or not the revenues

22

were achieved.

That's fine.

I am tracking

That is the answer.

CHAIRMAN DALEY:

Commissioner Fritchey.

24

COMMISSIONER FRITCHEY:

Andrea, there is

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 109

1

something I am trying to understand conceptually.

2

Throughout the budget, one of the mechanisms that is

3

used I guess maybe to justify or equalize certain

4

departmental budgets would be an appropriation

5

transfer for reimbursement.

I can understand that.

Let's say Facilities does something

6
7

for a certain department, and then it gets

8

reimbursed through an appropriation transfer; is

9

that right?
MS. GIBSON:

10
11

It can be done through a

chargeback; yes.
COMMISSIONER FRITCHEY:

12

In the President's

13

Office, they have doubled the amount of

14

appropriation transfers for reimbursement from

15

designated funds from $90,000 to just under

16

$180,000.

17

What is a reimbursement to the President?
I don't mean this facetiously.

What

18

services do the President's Office provide that

19

merit a reimbursement to the office?

20

simply a way of moving numbers around?

21

MS. GIBSON:

Is that just

When reimbursement has the

22

most impact is when it is a transfer from one

23

funding source to another.

24

the President's Office.

An example of that is

That is work that is

________________________________________________

completed on behalf of the Forest Preserves, for

2

example.

3

legislative support, legislative affairs that they

4

perform on behalf of the Forest Preserves.
So there is a reimbursement from that

5
6

They reimburse, in terms of the

source of funds to the President's Office.
COMMISSIONER FRITCHEY:

7

How do you decide

8

-- are you fractionally then assigning ten percent

9

of this position to the Forest Preserves?

10

percent of this position to Revenue?

11

to Risk Management?

12

understand how this works.
MS. GIBSON:

13

Eight

Five percent

Again, I am truly trying to

Actually, with the Forest

14

Preserves in particular, we sit down with them every

15

year to review the reimbursement and validate them.

16

For example, Matt is another entity, the Secretary

17

to the Board of Commissioners, that receives a

18

reimbursement for facilitating the meetings.

19

request is how much time is spent.

20

evaluate that?

The

How do we

I know that when the reimbursement

21
22

began several years ago from the Forest Preserves,

23

the Forest Preserves was able to eliminate a

24

position.

4

MS. GIBSON:

The Forest

This year it is $178,439.
There are several

reimbursements in that.
COMMISSIONER FRITCHEY:

Is there a backup that says -- here is

out of confusion than anything else.

as an example.

really don't mean it with any kind of value-weighted

opinion.

to move the money around, whether you want to assign

fifteen percent of this person or eighteen percent

10
11

It is a pretty conveniently ambiguous way

of that person.

I mean, it is obviously subjective.

MS. GIBSON:

We have a basis for it.

We

12

view it as something we look at every year to see if

13

we think it is valid.

14

will go back to the Forest Preserves, they certainly

15

don't want to be spending more than what they think

16

is appropriate.

17

of the equation.

18

Certainly in the case -- I

We review it kind of on both sides

COMMISSIONER FRITCHEY:

So what changed

19

then that doubled the reimbursement from the

20

President's Office from last year to this year?

21

MS. GIBSON:

There is an additional

22

reimbursement from the Health System for a health

23

policy person within the President's Office.

24

COMMISSIONER FRITCHEY:

What position would

I

COMMISSIONER FRITCHEY:

5

the follow-up question of that would be:

6

wouldn't that person just be in the Health System?
MS. GIBSON:

7

Seriously, I guess
Why

This is somebody within the

President's Office.

9

Is that an existing

MS. GIBSON:

It is Jennifer Ebie.

He is dedicated to Health

It is an existing position.

COMMISSIONER FRITCHEY:

Again, I am not

16

trying to single anybody out.

I am still one of the

17

newer guys here, but after three years I still don't

18

understand how some of these things are allotted.

19

Maybe I shouldn't have you educate me on everybody

20

else's time.

I am just trying to understand.
I am going to guess that I am probably

not alone in understanding how the reimbursement

As you see, and as you know, the

15

Comptroller's Office has three primary functions.

16

One is to provide timely and accurate financial

17

information which means that we maintain the

18

accounting records, general ledger, provide

19

financial reporting, and are responsible for annual

20

audits which we refer to as the "comprehensive

to maintain the payroll system, to pay employees

In the accounts payable area, we

You have touched on something I was

going to ask about; that is our payroll system.

far along are we with the new system?

MR. WILSON:

to be heard.

This is two

So we have to flip and

run over to the new one.

the old system.

old system so we can switch over to the new system.

18

Do we have a date that we will switch over?

19

I know about the patch to

We are still working to patch the

MR. SAMSTEIN:

Yes, Commissioner.

Prasad

20

Nettem will outline that.

But a quick answer to

21

your question -- we felt payroll is too important

22

not to have two solutions.

23

that there was no risk of interruption,

24

Commissioner.

We are working to ensure

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 118

Our intent is to implement the

1
2

upgraded payroll system by the end of the year.

3

next few weeks will be very critical in that

4

development.

5

team has been working with the ERP team and the

6

Bureau of Technology on the second solution, which

7

is targeted to provide a temporary solution into

8

next year.

That is exactly why Lawrence and his

That would go live on November 5.
Then our intent is to upgrade the old

9
10

system by the end of the year, so we have the

11

redundancy in place.
We expect the outcome to be in the

12
13

The

next several weeks.
COMMISSIONER SIMS:

14

I have another

15

question.

I know several years ago -- I have been

16

asked this question.

17

twelve o'clock our payroll checks, for those who had

18

direct deposit, at twelve o'clock at night -- we get

19

paid on Friday.

20

will be Friday, the next day.

21

a.m. your check would be in your account already.

22

Now it doesn't hit until sometimes 8:30 the next

23

morning.

24

twelve o'clock any more?

There was a time where at

Twelve o'clock on Thursday, which
But at twelve o'clock

Is there a reason why it doesn't hit at

2

the morning, Friday morning.
MR. WILSON:

That is primarily on the

3

bank's side.

4

in the same way by providing an ACH transfer so that

5

they take those funds out of our account and

6

distribute them according to the distribution list

7

of employees in their bank accounts.

8

COMMISSIONER SIMS:

9

We are continuing to fund the payroll

So it is the bank that

used to do it at twelve o'clock.

When are they

10

legally supposed to take it?

11

wait until that next day?

12

your account at twelve o'clock a.m. as opposed to

13

8:30 a.m.?

14

that a County decision?

15
16
17

Are they supposed to

Are they putting it in

Was that the bank's decision?

MR. WILSON:

Or was

That is a bank decision.

That

is not a County decision.
COMMISSIONER SIMS:

That was just -- when

18

they were doing it at 12:00 a.m., that was just a

19

service that they were providing to the employees.

20

MR. WILSON:

I can't confirm why their

21

timing occurred.

22

time in which they are running their processes.

23
24

I believe it is related to the

COMMISSIONER SIMS:

That could be, because

when they were trying to get all of the employees,
________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 120

1

the credit union ones, and some of the people were

2

still banking at the Bank of America.

3

was the reason why a lot of people they moved over

4

to the credit union, and once they got us to change

5

it.

6

MR. WILSON:

7

COMMISSIONER SIMS:

8

I don't know.

Maybe we need to ask

them a question, I guess.
CHAIRMAN DALEY:

9

Commissioner Collins.

COMMISSIONER COLLINS:

10

Thank you.

I just have a few quick questions for

11
12

That could be.

I know that

you.

I may put something in writing later.
I am encouraged about you indicating

13
14

that you were able to get the payout to the vendors

15

and to the people earlier.

16

of days and you reduced the number after you get the

17

requisition to pay, to write the check.

18

doing it, and you are expediting it in a shorter

19

period of time than before?
MR. WILSON:

20

You had a certain number

Yes, we are.

So you are

Thank you very

21

much.

On average, we are paying vendors in thirty-

22

one days is the average.

23

we receive information, but we continue to be in

24

compliance with the local government Prompt Payment

Our range depends on when

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 121

1

Act which requires that we pay within sixty days.

2

So, yes, we have been consistently exceeding that

3

governmental statutory requirement, striving to

4

reduce our payment time even further.
COMMISSIONER COLLINS:

5
6

our law?

7

MR. WILSON:

8

COMMISSIONER COLLINS:

9

Is that State law or

That is State law.
The State doesn't

pay their bills in a year, I guess.

People are not

10

receiving their checks and they are confused, too.

11

It takes a lot of time to sit out there in the

12

District office and explain to the people that we

13

are not the ones that are holding up your money.

14

Your money comes from the State.

15

They are hurting and threatening to be closed.

16

They don't care.

The other thing, as it relates to

17

County Government, the time-consuming element -- we

18

are sitting here and saying, "Yeah, yeah, yeah."

19

is the process that validates the fact that these

20

are legitimate requisitions and they have been

21

proven to have done the work as they state they have

22

done, especially to our vendors.

23
24

That is what is so important.

It

It

often gets jammed down, and it often gets held up on
________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 122

1

people's desks.

I would hope that through the

2

upgrades in technology, not only can those people

3

who are doing the vetting of everything that comes

4

in, that you can look in the computer and make sure

5

that everything is in before you cut the check, and

6

be able to move that process back.

7

are doing this in seven days, and it is going out,

8

people are saying, "No, you are not."

When we say you

The point is we have to be very

9
10

careful when you say that it is based on when you

11

get the accurate information.

12

would cut no checks unless everything, every "I" has

13

been dotted, and every "T" crossed.

14

hope that the upgrade in your technology -- you keep

15

talking about the billions of dollars, hundreds of

16

millions now that have been spent on technology, and

17

it is still not working well.

18

on your side is all you can do.

19

on.

I don't blame you.

I

Then I would

But you are doing it
You kind of keep

The other part to that is, in the name

20
21

of transparency, we are not able to go into the

22

system and pull down certain checks to certain

23

vendors or even to individuals as we used to be able

24

to do.

We had a Commissioner here that went too far

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 123

1

and had the personal information in the system where

2

you could be exposed to some other things.

3

want to do that.

4

want to know, sometimes I want to see payouts for

5

certain things.

6

certain things that you are going to fix, that you

7

can't pull it out and certain things that you can.

8
9

We don't

But we as Commissioners sometimes

I was told, my staff was told that

Prior to your coming on, about a year
ago, we went in and sat down with the Comptroller.

10

They showed us the kinds of things that we were able

11

to pull up and the things that we were not.

12

never really found out why.

We

13

So, can you look at that?

14

should be nothing that a Board member, without going

15

through the waiting period, the request for

16

information, to get information on any payout that

17

we may have a concern about.

18

and sometimes I know I vote -- we just go along

19

walking with the crowd and say, "Okay.

20

nothing we can do to stop this from moving forward."

21

But it bothers me.

It's on my conscience and I have

22

to check this out.

And sometimes we can pull it out

23

or we cannot pull it out.

MR. WILSON:

ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 127

As you know, the Office of Contract

1
2

Compliance has two primary functions.

The first one

3

is that we certify minority- and women-owned

4

businesses.

5

vendors comply with the MBE/WBE participation

6

commitment.

The second is that we ensure that our

With respect to positions, we are up

7

by one position for FY14.

That position will be

fully dedicated to the Health and Hospitals System,

awards.

It will also be fully funded by Health and

The next line talks about our

13

accomplishments for FY13.

It provides our annual

15

diversity report for FY12.

It was noted that we

16

exceeded our M/WBE participation commitments and we

17

achieved approximately thirty-six percent.
We also launched our reciprocal

18

certification program.

20

initiative.

21

This benefited our M/WBE vendors.

earlier this year.

highlights for FY2014.

I am excited about our new

10

certification and compliance management system.

11

Essentially, the contractors will now have access to

12

payment information that was paid to the primes so

13

they can know when they were paid or when they

14

should expect payment.
The other primary function that is

15
16

important for our department is that it will improve

17

our ability to effectively monitor the contracts.

18

Because not only will small businesses be able to

19

either confirm or reject what the vendor is stating

20

that was paid to the prime; they will also be able

21

to confirm how that subcontractor was paid, the

22

amount.

their contracts.

24

That is greater effective monitoring on

The next one that we are excited about

is the completion of the disparity study.

factors, including the County's procurement history,

CHAIRMAN DALEY:

Commissioner Collins.

COMMISSIONER COLLINS:

On the contract

11

compliance -- you only are interested, or your major

12

focus is on WBE and MBE, that kind of compliance.

13

The reason I am asking the question is because in

14

the past the contract compliance also included going

15

out to the various construction sites.

16

did a lot of it in the Hospital.

17

I know they

They look at the punch sheets.

They

18

put on their hard hats.

You had people there that

were part of that.

or not the contractors -- because they get paid.

They get payouts.

23

certain amount of money; have they actually

They had designated periods of

Do you do any of that now?

2

Do you do

3

that in Contract Compliance or do you have another

4

division that is actually seeing if the work is done

5

properly; they are actually following, keeping it

6

up, and doing the things that are on the punch

7

sheets, as they finish an area?
MS. GOMEZ:

8
9

bringing that up.

I am actually glad that you are

With our new system, we are

10

actually going to be onsite, on the construction

11

sites.

12

we will be able to enter that information on the

13

database online, and track what contractors are out

14

there.

15

what they stated who was going to be on the site.

16

Part of the feature of this system is that

We are going to be able to compare that to

So, yes, to answer your question, we

17

will be beginning to go on site visits.

18

COMMISSIONER COLLINS:

This will be good if

19

it is in your computer, because it will also help us

20

as it relates to the quality of the work, especially

21

when we are dealing with the building, the whole

22

capital project.

23

materials, they did a lot of that in the Hospital.

24

Things were told to be changed and none were

Because the use of interior

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 131

1

changed.
They were doing the same things over

2
3

and over again.

That is a major piece to save money

4

and to make sure you get the quality.
MR. SAMSTEIN:

5

Commissioner, that's a great

6

point, but I do want to make a point of

7

clarification.

8

as Jackie has alluded to, is doing site visits and

9

they are predominantly focused on the vendors

The Office of Contract Compliance,

10

meeting their goals with the MBE/WBE utilization

11

plans.

12

verifying that, is actually the responsibility of

13

the using department who manages the contract before

14

sending the invoice to the Comptroller.

The quality of construction or the work, or

Whether it is Capital Planning or

15
16

another agency, that obviously is an ongoing effort

17

for all of the using agencies to monitor and manage

18

their contracts before sending the invoices to the

19

Comptroller.
COMMISSIONER COLLINS:

20

So you are saying

21

that Contract Compliance will have nothing to do

22

with it?

23
24

MR. SAMSTEIN:

Contract Compliance -- their

primary focus continues to be on the ability for
________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 132

1

vendors to comply with their utilization plans for

2

minority and women business enterprises.

3

COMMISSIONER COLLINS:

My personal feelings

4

are that by putting it into Contract Compliance with

5

qualified construction people, them doing the punch

6

sheets is independent of them because what is going

7

to happen, when these are all connected together,

8

they are doing this together, it is not going to

9

change.

You are not going to get what you are

10

looking for, if it was totally independent and you

11

have people with the credentials to actually go in

12

and look to see and monitor that work, just as we go

13

in and monitor whether or not they have the right

14

amount of people, minorities.

15

you what happens in reality.

Because I will tell

They may put the MBE/WBE, most

16
17

certainly on the minorities, on the contract, saying

18

they have this number on here.

19

is -- how much money they are going to pay out, what

20

is the contract, how long do they take, and how long

21

do they stay?

22

They have no work to do.

23

then they will bring people who are not certified at

24

all to do the work and it is cheaper labor.

But the bottom line

They will have them come, pay them.
They will sit around and

There

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 133

1

is some serious problems out there.
I think Contract Compliance should

2
3

remain independent of the capital development

4

program.

I think you will get better results.
CHAIRMAN DALEY:

5

Commissioner, they do a

6

totally independent study.

They are making sure

7

that there is minority participation, as she alluded

8

to earlier.

9

enter all of this into the computer.

Now on the sites they will be able to

10

COMMISSIONER COLLINS:

11

have qualified people to know.
CHAIRMAN DALEY:

12

But you have got to

They can't certify the

13

quality of the cement that they are bringing in.

14

That is Capital's department.

15

at all.

16

expertise.

Her department, she wouldn't have the

COMMISSIONER COLLINS:

17

They wouldn't do that

Not the quality.

18

am saying the quality of the project itself.

19

not going to go in and see the texture of the

20

cement.

21

look at that.

COMMISSIONER COLLINS:

able to at the time, if they had a person that would

be able to suggest that.

10

CHAIRMAN DALEY:

Her goal is to make sure

11

that the contract compliance is being administered

12

to at the site, not whether or not the firewalls

13

were up to code.

14

That is not her responsibility.

Commissioner Sims.

COMMISSIONER SIMS:

7

I think what

8

Commissioner Collins is asking, and she can correct

me if I am wrong.

I think she is talking about a

10

construction manager.

When I was Chairman of

Construction, when we did the Domestic Violence

12

Court, we did hire a construction manager to manage

13

that project.

14

reporting back to us to make sure that everything

15

was going properly.

That person was responsible for

I think what she is probably asking is

16
17

does that fall up under your department?

18

have somebody like that in your office that would

19

monitor the program?

20

CHAIRMAN DALEY:

21

COMMISSIONER SIMS:

Or do you

It falls under John Cooke.
That is what she is

22

maybe asking; is there a person that you would hire

23

as a check and balance, to have a person that would

24

do that?

that everybody knows that is going to be a third

MS. GOMEZ:

Correct.

COMMISSIONER STEELE:

Is there any

expectations that you have that we are going to

21

expand or increase the volume of compliance that we

are doing there, in any particular numbers that we

are looking at, that will be increasing?

fully dedicated to working on the Hospital projects.

anticipating this person to do is to actually spend

COMMISSIONER SIMS:

Let me rephrase my

21

question that I asked before.

22

person that can answer it.

23

in regards to payroll that I asked?

24

MR. NETTEM:

Maybe you are the

Did you hear my question

The question was -- the goal

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 143

1

of the payroll system?
COMMISSIONER SIMS:

2

My question is:

When

3

do you electronically send over to the banks the

4

payroll?

5

day before, twelve o'clock at night or eight o'clock

6

in the morning?

When do you do that?

MR. NETTEM:

7

Do you do that the

Commissioner, the way the

8

process works is as soon as we have done the payroll

9

process, we then make a file that will be sent to

10

the bank, an ACH file.

So we need to work with the

11

bank to see why it has changed from night to 8:00

12

a.m.

13

how we can handle that.

We probably need to contact the bank to see

For our purpose, we will be sending

14
15

the file to the bank as soon as we complete the

16

file.

17

COMMISSIONER SIMS:

18

before twelve o'clock the day before.

19

You may finish it

My other question is:

When we

20

implement the new time clock, is that going to

21

adjust the salaries of the employees?

22

say a person is in a pay period.

23

late for the whole pay period.

24

something happened and they are an hour late.

6

will be working with Lisa and also the departments

7

to put those rules into the system.
COMMISSIONER SIMS:

8
9

There are rules within the
We

But you have to take

into consideration what part is the union playing

10

into that as well because if you start saying -- we

11

have a time clock and somebody says they make

12

$20,000 a year, and let's look at it.

13

been an hour late, you have already adjusted the

14

payroll by an hour.
MR. SAMSTEIN:

15

If they have

Commissioner, you are

16

correct.

17

is referring to the CBA he is referring to the union

18

collective bargaining agreements.

19

absolutely correct.

20

the rules, and when he mentioned Lisa, it is Lisa

21

Meador in Labor Relations.

22

Just for a point of clarification, when he

You are

The software system would embed

You are absolutely correct that the

software system would embed the rules of each

within the software specifically.
COMMISSIONER SIMS:

Was that part of your

3

discussion with the unions right now in implementing

4

that and that will possibly adjust the payroll?

5

MR. SAMSTEIN:

It is not a discussion point

6

with the unions per se.

What the software does, it

7

exactly contemplates the check as the union

8

agreement stipulates.

9

which, as you know, expired late last year, would be

The current union agreements,

10

the basis that would initially be put in.

When new

11

labor agreements are reached, then you are correct,

12

based on those conversations that would be input

13

into the software directly.

COMMISSIONER SIMS:

What if you have a

15

situation where a person gets to work early.

18

if there is a decrease to their salaries?

MR. SAMSTEIN:

They

Will it reflect an

20

indicate what is authorized and allowed under their

21

union collective bargaining agreement.

22

their collective bargaining agreement stipulates, it

23

would be merited exactly.

exact rules of the different collective bargaining

I can't speak to the

ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 146

agreements.

The software will not take any

2

liberties.

3

our agreements.

It will literally translate what is in

COMMISSIONER SIMS:

4

So what they are going

5

to be looking at is actual time and not adjustments

6

to salaries; is that what you are saying?
MR. SAMSTEIN:

7

I am not sure that I follow

8

the very last question, Commissioner.

I think

9

whatever we are authorized and required to pay them

10

under the collective bargaining agreements is

11

exactly as we do today.

The software wouldn't

pay.

18

20

It would be just

It is going to be a uniform system

COMMISSIONER SIMS:

Then what is the

purpose of the clock?
MR. SAMSTEIN:

The purpose of the system is

21

to automate it, reduce the processing time, and to

22

make sure --

23
24

COMMISSIONER SIMS:
misunderstanding.

Maybe I am

What do you mean "reduce

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 147

1

processing time"?

What does that mean?

MR. SAMSTEIN:

2

As it relates to our

3

payroll.

Today there is a fairly manual-oriented

4

process for entering time and attendance for

5

individuals.

6

County and there are processes that are not always

7

uniform.

8

an individual works, pursuant to their collective

9

bargaining agreement, the time under which they are

There are timekeepers all around the

But, at the end of the day, the time that

10

paid, the system wouldn't change that.

11

clocks do create a uniform method for which to track

12

and indicate the hours that the individual, in fact,

13

is at their work location.

14

COMMISSIONER SIMS:

The time

If there is a clock and

15

it tells how many hours a person works in the day;

16

if that person is an hour late, you are going to, at

17

the end of the day, you are going to adjust their

18

salary, and if they are making, in the total of the

19

year, if they are making $20,000 a year there is the

20

possibility that over a year's time there could be a

21

$500 decrease over a period of a year that they have

22

been late?

23
24

MR. SAMSTEIN:
Commissioner.

That is correct,

That is how it is today.

The

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 148

individual is paid for the hours they work.

2

system isn't going to change that.

greater accountability.
COMMISSIONER SIMS:

MR. SAMSTEIN:

COMMISSIONER SIMS:

Because the timekeeper

So the

Commissioner.

That is exactly correctly,

requirement to be able to connect with the Lawson

require that the overall system be a Lawson system?

It doesn't necessarily

That is correct.
Not that I am for

21

MR. SAMSTEIN:

Commissioner Suffredin --

Commissioner Gainer.
COMMISSIONER GAINER:

I thought there would

I had a couple of questions.

you for your presentation.

about this matching of savings from promises and all

of that stuff.

4

Accenture contract and other contracts in which we

5

don't pay, and the vendor is going to get paid on

6

savings that we will achieve at a future point in

7

time.

You and I have discussed the

We saw the Inspector General's report

8
9

I asked Andrea earlier

on contracts with PwC.

Have you seen that report?

10

MS. ANDREWS:

I have not, no.

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

I would encourage you

12

to do so.

13

We didn't pay them per se.

14

savings.

15

now that the Inspector General is involved, massive

16

overpayments, more than we thought we were going to

17

get into.

18

It was a similar setup to Accenture's.
They captured some

It ended up being fairly disastrous, such

Do we have any other contracts like

19

that, where we actually are not paying for what we

20

are buying, but the vendor is capturing portions of

21

either A, an assumed savings, or an actual savings?

22

MS. ANDREWS:

Off the top of my head,

23

certainly the Accenture contract was unique.

The

24

closest to that might be some of the audit contracts

point, they are paid based on what they actually

find.
COMMISSIONER GAINER:

7

But, again, at that

What about US

Equities?

8

MS. ANDREWS:

The US Equities contract --

9

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

There is a department

10

more relevant to ask that question of, but I thought

11

that that is part of how they were being paid, too?

12

MR. SAMSTEIN:

Commissioner, as you

13

indicated, it is the Real Estate and Economic

14

Development who manage that.

15
16
17

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

I can ask that

tomorrow, if it is more appropriate.
MR. SAMSTEIN:

I would say that our

18

understanding of the contract is we do work closely

19

with Real Estate and the team on that project.

20

are obviously managing it.

21

is not paid as a percent of the savings.

for billable hours, effectively, or for the

deliverables that are associated with it, but not on

What about some of

these energy retrofit contracts?
MS. ANDREWS:

3

Again, in those instances,

4

with the exception of the Accenture contracts and

5

contracts like that, essentially -COMMISSIONER GAINER:

6
7

What do you mean

"contracts like that"?
MS. ANDREWS:

8

Contracts like US Equities,

9

Accenture, anything where the Procurement Department

10

was an important part of the evaluation of what they

11

were submitting as actually identifying cost

12

savings.

13

would be something that would be managed directly by

14

the user department.

But in the instance of the rebates, that

The Procurement Department does not

15
16

see -- with the exception of if there are issues or

17

problems brought up by the user department or the

18

vendor, we have not been historically involved in

19

that process.

20

MR. SAMSTEIN:

I think the Commissioner is

21

specifically referring to the energy-savings

22

contracts.

23

Capital Planning and John Cooke and his department,

24

that monitors those energy-savings service

Those are contracts that are managed by

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

contracts.

2

specifically to NORESCO and Johnson Controls.
COMMISSIONER GAINER:

3
4
5

I think, Commissioner, you are referring

right.

That is something for them tomorrow.
Shannon, you are only a part of the

6

choice of those vendors?

7

standard procurement process?

8
9

That is exactly

MS. ANDREWS:

They don't go through the

They do go through the

standard procurement process.

Our role as the

10

Office of the Chief Procurement Officer is to ensure

11

that the language in the contract is reflective of

12

what the using agency has requested, and that the

13

language in it is appropriate in terms of giving us

14

a recourse if those goals are not met.

15

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

So we have the

16

NORESCO contract, the Accenture -- even though the

17

PwC contract predated you, and was at the Health and

18

Hospitals, I encourage you to read the IG report

19

because it is pretty damning.

20

is anything else outstanding that has rebates or the

21

vendor paid through other things that the County

22

must accomplish?

23
24

MS. ANDREWS:

We don't think there

Certainly not.

We have been

working closely with the Budget Department to go
________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 159

1

through and do an analysis of some contracts that

2

exist in our marketplace where there are rebate

3

incentives attached to them.
For instance, with our Grainger

4
5

contract -COMMISSIONER GAINER:

6

But an incentive is

7

different, and I appreciate that.

8

they have a set base level of pay.

9

other achievements that they hit, they can receive

10

But basically
If they have

some additional.
What I am asking is:

11

In the first set

12

of contracts, the County has to actually get

13

something done for us to receive the benefit of it,

14

not just for the vendor to receive the benefit of

15

it.

16

all they had to do was propose savings.

17

have not saved a dollar, and they would have still

18

gotten paid just by identifying savings.

19

the things that concern me, and I want to avoid in

20

the future.

21

The concern about the Accenture contract was
We could

There is the energy-savings contract.

We will look at US Equities in the confirmation of

That is correct.

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

getting paid by what they actually save us; not what

MR. SAMSTEIN:

That is correct.

Those are

after the bills.

Again, that contract is managed.

15

To our knowledge, we are not aware of any other.

16

will certainly look back and see if there is

17

something that we are not aware of.

18

I do just want to point out that the

19

energy service contracts with Johnson Controls and

20

the rest were managed by John Cooke and his team.

We

You may recall, Commissioner, we did

21
22

respond to some questions in writing after the June

Finance Committee hearing when we talked about the

24

bonds.

Those vendors do, in fact, have -- I think

________________________________________________

John Cooke and I responded.

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

the County Auditor can independently go in and audit

exactly.

They had performance measures, but they

2

were also responsible for monitoring themselves to

say if they achieved the actual thing to allow them

4

to get paid.

The irony is not lost.
The only thing I want to know -- do we

have any of these other contracts?

no, not to your knowledge, but you will get back to

24

that the procurements that are presented before the

It is our job to ensure

regulations that govern public procurement.

4

Our primary function is to ensure that

6

all local, State, and Federal laws, rules, and

7

regulations.

To that extent, we depend heavily on

8
9

That is our primary function.

the user departments as the experts of the services

10

and the needs that they require.

11

to go in and tell John Cooke or John Yonan or

12

anybody else, or other folks, how they should be

13

managing their contracts.

14

the point of the request for an amendment or for an

15

extension of time or money, is our primary role is

16

to ensure that the contract language allows for

17

that.

18

We don't presume

What we do require, at

We also request documentation to

support the need for it.

The challenge that we are in -- again,

23

we do not have the in-house expertise to make

24

judgments on whether the departments are receiving

2

That is their function.

3

documentation to make certain to the extent that

4

there were requirements that were laid out in the

5

original contract, we will request that

6

documentation and supporting information to ensure

7

that again the amendments, the contracts are in

8

keeping with the laws, rules, and regulations that

9

govern the process.

10

So we do require

COMMISSIONER COLLINS:

I understand.

So

11

you really have to rely on their information to

12

determine whether or not, when you enter into an

13

agreement to purchase through the City of Chicago,

14

or when you do a joint purchasing, when you do it

15

with the State or whatever to save money, has that

16

decision been made prior to it coming to you, your

17

final action?

18

Or is that your total decision?

MS. ANDREWS:

That is the responsibility of

19

the user department.

Again, my role is to govern

20

the process.

21

tell a user department -- unless there is some sort

22

of procurement needs or some sort of language that

23

is outlined in the contract or if there is some sort

24

of law, be it local, Federal, or State, that has not

I am not in a position where I can

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 168

1

been adhered to as is outlined in the contract.
There is no role of my department in

2
3

terms of determining whether the final product

4

and/or services that were received met the needs of

5

the user department.

6

the user department.

That is the responsibility of

COMMISSIONER COLLINS:

7
8

that.

9

to consume all of your time.

I am not asking you

Prior to your coming on board -- I don't want
But prior to you

10

coming on board there was a lot of talk about our

11

saving money.

12

consolidating purchasing with other agencies and all

13

of that, to save money with the State.

14

is that your role?

15

agency everything that they are asking for, it is

16

fine, it is in their budget, and all of the things

17

that you do, the legal stuff; do you have the

18

authority to make the decision as to who you are

19

going to purchase it from as it relates to bulk

20

purchasing, as it relates to consolidated purchasing

21

and all of that?

I always believed in bulk purchasing,

I am saying

Once you get from the using

22

MS. ANDREWS:

My authority is outlined by

23

the procurement code.

If the procurement has been

24

done, and it follows the procurement standards that
________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 169

1

are outlined by that code, then I have the authority

2

to execute that contract; of course, after coming to

3

the Board for approval.
Again, I hope that this is answering

4
5

your questions, but the Procurement Department does

6

not manage contracts.

7

the contracts.

8

ordinances, laws, rules, or regulations, I can then

9

say, "This is not a contract that can move forward."

The user departments manage

If they don't meet certain

10

This is something that I do quite often, actually.

11

If something is not in compliance with the laws,

12

rules, and regulations as outlined by this Board and

13

other entities, I do have the authority and I do

14

tell the departments that they can't move forward.
