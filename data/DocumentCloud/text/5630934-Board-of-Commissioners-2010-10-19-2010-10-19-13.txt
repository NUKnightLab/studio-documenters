 EXPLANATION
In March 2008, the Board authorized CHA to execute a cost reimbursement plus incentive fee
contract with CVR Associates, Inc. for the administration and operation of a portion of the
CHA’s Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation and Housing Choice Voucher Programs. On
December 31, 2010, the Contract with CVR will expire. CVR has satisfactorily met its
obligation under the Contract and CHA has determined that it would be in its best interest to
have CVR continue the provision of services currently provided under the Contract through
exercise of the Contract’s available 2-year option. In addition, CVR and Associates has greatly
improved Owner and Participant services; by updating briefing materials for both Owners and
Participants, expanding the Owner and Participant Council, and jointly with CHA produced a
HQS Guidebook
The services currently under contract with CVR are the HCV Southwest Satellite Office
(administering 13,000 vouchers), HCV inspections, and Call Center operations. The HCV
Department recommends exercising the Contract’s option for these services based on the
following:
•

CVR and Associates has extensive experience working with CHA’s HCV Program and has
insight to the status of existing files and program compliance.

•

CVR currently administers approximately 13,000 vouchers in the Southwest Satellite Office,
and has worked at great length to meet High Performer status among SEMAP performance
indicators.

•

CVR has met and maintained its Call Center Service Level Agreement (“SLA“). The SLA
states that the Customer Service and Inspections Call Center answer 80% of the calls within
2 minutes. Overall, 95% of the time, the Call Centers have met or exceeded the SLA.

•

CVR has Ranked #1 among Owners and Participants in Customer Satisfaction.

Additionally, CHA desires to amend and restate the Contract to include additional services for
CVR and change the Contract’s payment structure from cost reimbursement with a performance
incentive fee to a fixed performance based type payment contract.
•
•
•

The CHA advertised Request for Proposal No. 10-00582 (“RFP”) on August 2, 2010 for
HCV Program services not covered by the CVR Contract to be based on a fixed performance
based type payment contract.
CHA is currently engaged in negotiations with CVR for additional services that include
Landlord Services across all Satellite Offices and South Satellite Office HCV Program
Services, which will add an additional 6,000 vouchers to CVR’s portfolio.
For purposes of management and administration of the Contract and to clarify CVR’s
performance standards, CHA wants the payments under the option term for the Contract’s
services to be based on the same payment structure as the additional services currently being
negotiated with CVR under RFP No. 10-00582.

 PROCUREMENT HISTORY
In March 2008, pursuant to RFP No. 01511, the Board authorized CHA to execute a contract
with CVR to administer and operate a portion of the Chicago Housing Authority’s Section 8
Moderate Rehabilitation and Housing Choice Voucher Programs. Contract No. 8016 with CVR
was executed for the base period of April 1, 2008 to December 31, 2010 (term of two (2) years
and nine (9) months). The original contract was a cost reimbursement + incentive fee type
contract, with a compensation amount not-to-exceed $23,527,475.
Amendment No.1 modified Contract No. 8016 to include 1) improvements to the CHA’s Call
Centers Interactive Voice Response System (“IVR”), 2) to add staff to manage the HCV Call
Center, and 3) to perform an additional 10,771 HQS Inspections to meet the needs of the HCV
program. The Contract’s base term amount increased by $2,489,323, bringing the not-to exceed
compensation amount to $26,016,798. CVR performed the increased services under the same
terms and conditions as set forth in the Contract.
Amendment No.2 modified the Contract to include an adjustment to the Operating Budget for
Contract Year 2 (FY 2009) and Management Fee rate (Operation Fee and Performance Fee) for
Contract Year 2 so that the cost and the Management Fee were commensurate with the additional
responsibilities undertaken by CVR. The Contract’s base term not-to-exceed compensation
amount was increased by $253,190, bringing the not-to exceed compensation amount to
$26,269,988.
Amendment No. 3 modified Contract No. 8016 to clarify and revise certain sections of Exhibit B
(Statement of Work) and to clarify and revise Exhibit C (Performance Standards). Amendment
No. 4 modified Contract No. 8016 to set the Operating Budget and Management Fees for
Contract Year 3 of the Base Term (FY 2010)
Based on the foregoing, it is in the best interest of the CHA to exercise the Contract’s 2-year
option and to negotiate, amend and restate the Contract with CVR for an amount not-to-exceed
$23,000,000.00 for a two year period.
