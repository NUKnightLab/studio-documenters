Honorable City Council:

Re: Request for issuance of new encroachment permits to Greektown Propco LLC.

issuance of certain encroachment permits that affect property owned by Greektown Casino, L.L.C.,
a Michigan limited liability company (?Greektown Casino?) as set forth in such Resolutions
(collectively, the ?Encroachment Permits?).

Greektown Casino has entered into an agreement with Greektown Propco LLC, a Delaware limited

Propco in place of the existing Encroachment Permits effective upon closing of the contemplated
transaction.

RESOLUTION IN SUPPORT OF COMMUNITY SOLAR POWERED ELECTRICITY

By Council Member Benson on behalf of the Green Task Force Renewable Energy
Subcommittee

Whereas, Solar energy is truly renewable and derived from the sun?s radiation which falls on
every household, and can be harnessed by installing solar panels; and,

Whereas, Solar energy is a clean and renewable energy source that can provide improved
public health, reduced energy bills, and lessen greenhouse gas emissions, while supporting
utility grid reliability, with low maintenance costs, promotingjobs and increasing economic
development; and,

Whereas, The bene?ts of solar energy can be shared by more households than energy derived
from burning fossil fuels in large centralized power plants, because improved technology has
transformed solar energy into a cost effective form of renewable energy; and,

Whereas, Community solar electricity bene?ts are shared by residents including low income
households, and community solar power utilizes community-controlled plants on a
decentralized model to produce electricity; and,

Whereas, Community solar promotes energy democracy; and,

Whereas, Low- to moderate-income households, non-pro?ts and government organizations face
various barriers to using solar power; and,

Whereas, Policies that can increase ?nancing options, credit scores and access to the Federal
Investment Tax Credit will promote the growth of solar energy in low income communities; and,

Whereas, The City of Detroit?s leadership, which has expressed a desire to be more ?green?,
conducted a solar feasibility study, and has signed on to the objectives of the Paris Climate
Accords; and,

Whereas, The Detroit City Council has supported State Legislation favorable to solar
power, such as the Energy Freedom Package in 2018; and,

Whereas, According to a January 20l 6 report by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory,
the City of Detroit has 2.6 gigawatts of rooftop solar photovoltaic technical potential, which can
power approximately 200,000 homes; and,

Whereas, The residents of Detroit should have access to solar energy and its associated bene?ts,
such as lower electricity bills, public health and economic development;

Therefore be it resolved that, The Detroit City Council calls on our legislators, elected of?cials,
the mayor, commissioners, etc. to join the millions of citizens, grassroots organizations and local
governments across the country in supporting the growth of solar energy use and to adopt policies
that promote its equitable deployment; and,

Be it further resolved that, The Detroit City Council also calls on other communities and
jurisdictions to join with us in this action by passing similar resolutions; and

Be it further resolved that, The Detroit City Council supports education to increase public
awareness of the threat of climate change and the danger of inaction to address its impacts, and
encourages lively discussion to build understanding and consensus to take appropriate community
and municipal actions to respond democratically to these threats; AND

Be it further resolved that, Copies of this resolution shall be provided to members of the Michigan

delegation in Congress, Michigan Governor?s of?ce, the Detroit Delegation, constituents and media
representatives.

RESOLUTION BY COUNCIL MEMBER RAQUEL CASTANEDA-LOPEZ
RESOLUTION IN SUPPORT OF THE MEDICARE FOR ALL ACT OF 2019

WHEREAS, The mission of the Detroit City Council is to promote the economic, cultural and
physical welfare of Detroit?s citizens through Charter-mandated legislative functions;
and

WHEREAS, The current healthcare system fails to provide adequate healthcare, which is a basic
right of all people living in the United States. The U.S. pays nearly $11,000 per
person for health care, the highest healthcare per capita spending rate in the world;
and

WHEREAS, Despite spending over 18 percent of the nation?s gross domestic product on
healthcare, the United States has health outcomes that are signi?cantly worse than
other industrialized countries. U.S. life expectancy is lower than other nations, while
the U.S. infant mortality rate is much higher. Additionally, the U.S. has higher rates
of obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and preventable deaths when compared to other
industrialized countries. Detroiters experience diabetes and obesity at rates even
higher than the national average; and

WHEREAS, Although the Affordable Health Care Act (ACA) has resulted in dramatic increases in
health insurance coverage since its passage in 2010, too many Americans are one
medical crisis away from bankruptcy, or they are forced to choose between either rent
and food, or lifesaving medical treatment and medicines; and

WHEREAS, The Medicare for All Act of 2019, if passed, would simplify the healthcare system by
creating a single-payer universal Medicare program that would cover all Americans,
including the 28 million Americans that are currently uninsured. This model would
reduce the exorbitant amount currently spent on administering the inefficient multi-
payer system, and allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices, significantly lowering the
cost of prescription drugs, and

WHEREAS, The features of the bill include provisions that would eliminate copays, premiums,
and deductibles; ensure that every single resident of the U.S. has access to
comprehensive quality healthcare, including primary care, hospital and outpatient
services; long term services and supports; mental health and substance abuse
treatments; laboratory and diagnostic services and ambulatory services; and gives
patients freedom to choose their doctors, hospitals, and other providers; NOW
THEREFORE BE IT

RESOLVED, The Detroit City Council, as an advocate of the ef?cient use of tax payer dollars,
expresses its strong support of Medicare for All Act of 201 9 and urges the Federal Government to
pass this posthaste; THEREFORE BE IT FINALLY

RESOLVED, That copies of this resolution be forwarded to the Detroit Delegation in Washington
and to President Trump.
