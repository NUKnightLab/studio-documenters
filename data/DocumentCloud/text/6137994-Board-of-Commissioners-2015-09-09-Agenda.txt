PROPOSED RESOLUTION
CALLING UPON THE COOK COUNTY MEDICAL EXAMINER’S OFFICE TO MODIFY ITS
REPORTING OF GUNSHOT HOMICIDES TO INCLUDE THE CLASSIFICATION OF
VICTIMS OF HISPANIC, LATINO, OR SPANISH ORIGIN, CONSISTENT WITH THE
CATEGORIES OUTLINED IN THE UNITED STATES CENSUS DATA COLLECTION
WHEREAS, as of August 25, 2015, the Cook County Medical Examiner’s Office does not track whether
the deceased individuals on which it keeps records were individuals of Hispanic, Latino or Spanish
origin; and,
WHEREAS, the absence of this detail in the Cook County Medical Examiner’s Office poses a significant
problem when it comes to tracking the identities, backgrounds and relevant circumstances of individuals
killed by gun violence in Cook County; and,
WHEREAS, according to data from the Cook County Medical Examiner’s Office, in 2013 the total
number of gunshot homicides was 425; of which 345 were African American victims, meaning 80 were
listed as Caucasian; and,
WHEREAS, the failure of the Cook County Medical Examiner’s Office to note whether the deceased
victims of gun violence are individuals of Hispanic, Latino or Spanish origin means that of the 80
Caucasian individuals referenced in the above paragraph, a number of those individuals are in fact
individuals of Hispanic, Latino or Spanish origin; and,
WHEREAS, the failure of the Cook County Medical Examiner’s Office to note whether the deceased
victims of gun violence are individuals of Hispanic, Latino or Spanish origin creates an incomplete
picture of the nature and the extent of the impact of gun violence; and,
WHEREAS, without a complete picture of the nature and the extent of the impact of gun violence,
including a firm grasp of the ethnic groups and cultures most heavily impacted by gun violence,
policymakers at the County level cannot hope to be able to arrive at the necessary policy solutions to
effectively reduce that gun violence; and,
WHEREAS, Latinos make-up 24.7% of the population of Cook County, and 26% of the population of the
City of Chicago; and,
WHEREAS, the Cook County Medical Examiner’s Office has an obligation to record accurate data, which
is respectful to the victims and their families; and,

WHEREAS, Cook County government, like all units of government, has a responsibility to its residents
and taxpayers to do everything possible to preserve life, record data, and allocate resources consistent
with that data to communities highly impacted by gun violence;
NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that the President of Cook County and the Board of
Commissioners hereby call upon the Cook County Medical Examiner’s Office to modify its reporting of
gunshot homicides to include the classification of victims of Hispanic, Latino or Spanish origin, consistent
with the categories outlined in the United States Census Data Collection.

power to regulate for the protection of the public health, safety, morals, and welfare; and,
WHEREAS, the President of Cook County Board and the Cook County Board of Commissioners hereby
find that Cook County must take immediate action to address the heroin crisis in Cook County; and,
WHEREAS, Heroin-related overdose deaths have quadrupled in the United States in the past decade;
and,
WHEREAS, Nationwide, the number of people who admitted using heroin within the past year nearly
doubled between 2007 and 2013 to 681,000; and,

WHEREAS, In 2013 the DuPage County Board joined with the Coroner, State’s Attorney, Public

heroin addiction sweeping the region; and
WHEREAS, In 2014, DuPage County heroin deaths dropped from 46 the previous year to 33; and

PROPOSED ORDINANCE
REPLICA FIREARMS AND PAINT PELLET GUN ORDINANCE
BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners, that Chapter 54, Article XII of the
Cook County Code is hereby enacted as follows:
ARTICLE XII. REPLICA FIREARMS AND PAINT PELLET GUNS
Sec. 54-420. Replica guns.
(a) Title. This division shall be known and may be cited as the “Replica Firearms and Paint Pellet
Gun Ordinance” of Cook County, Illinois.
(b) Purpose and Policy. Like other major cities across America, the Cook County Government
faces the ongoing challenge of combating the scourge of gun violence in our communities. Many imitation
and replica firearms are manufactured in a manner that makes them nearly indistinguishable from working
firearms; and imitation and replica firearms pose the greatest threat to mistakes in the use of force by police.
Several foreign manufactured mobile phone cases which have the appearance of 9mm handguns have
recently appeared for sale on several online retail outlets, and the one "Gun Grip Case" features the grip of
an actual gun and trigger guard attached to the housing of a phone cover. When placed in a pocket, this
product is indistinguishable from a working handgun. Law enforcement officials from New York, New
Jersey and Michigan among others have advised people not to purchase or use this product. Numerous
incidents have been reported by law enforcement officers across the country who have mistakenly
identified imitation or replica firearms to be working handguns.
(c) It shall be unlawful for any person to purchase, possess, conceal, use, sell, give away or
otherwise transfer, or to engage in the business of selling or to exhibit for sale, a replica firearm, paint pellet
or paint pellet gun in Cook County, except as provided in subsection (e) of this section.
(d) Definitions. For the purposes of this chapter, the following terms shall have the following
meanings:
Paint pellet means a pellet or projectile of paint which explodes upon impact.
Paint pellet gun means any firearm, toy firearm or toy in the nature of a firearm which is powered
by compressed gas and which fires paint pellets.
Replica firearm means any device, object or facsimile made of plastic, wood, metal or any other
material, that a person could reasonably perceive as an actual firearm but that is incapable of being fired or
discharged, including, but not limited to mobile phone cases, lighters, and cameras, except that the term
shall not include any replica of an antique firearm. Each such replica firearm shall have as an integral part,
permanently affixed, a blaze orange plug inserted in the barrel of such replica firearm. Such plug shall be

Page 10 of 97

BOARD AGENDA

recessed no more than six millimeters from the muzzle end of the barrel of such firearm.
(e) Exceptions. The manufacture, marketing, distribution, sale and possession of replica firearms
are permitted if the devices are manufactured, marketed, distributed, sold or held solely for subsequent
transportation in intrastate, interstate or foreign commerce. Such devices shall not be displayed to the
general public or sold for other use in the city. The use or possession of a paint pellet or paint pellet gun is
permitted if the use or possession is solely within premises licensed as a public place of amusement; or if
the use or possession is solely for the purpose of transporting the paint pellet or paint pellet gun to or from
those premises by the licensee or agent or employee of the licensee, or by a common carrier, for purposes of
initial delivery, repair or disposal of the paint pellet or paint pellet gun.
(f) Violation. Any person who violates the provisions of this section, upon conviction thereof, shall
be fined not less than $100.00 nor more than $750.00 for each offense. Any such violation may also be
punishable as a misdemeanor by incarceration in a penal institution other than a penitentiary for up to six
months under the procedures set forth in Section 1-2-1.1 of the Illinois Municipal Code as amended, and in
the Illinois Code of Criminal Procedure, Illinois Revised Statutes, Chapter 38, Sections 100-1 et seq.
(1985), as amended, in a separate proceeding. All actions seeking the imposition of fines only shall be filed
as quasi-criminal actions subject to the provisions of the Illinois Code of Civil Procedure, Illinois Revised
Statutes, Chapter 110, Section 1-101, et seq. (1985), as amended. Each purchase, use, sale, gift or transfer of
any such replica firearm, paint pellet or paint pellet gun shall be deemed a separate and distinct offense, and
each day a person unlawfully engages in the business of selling or exhibits for sale any such replica firearm,
paint pellet or paint pellet gun shall be deemed a separate and distinct offense.
Effective date: This ordinance shall be in effect immediately upon adoption.

PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT
COOK COUNTY SERVICE OCCUPATION TAX
WHEREAS, just two short years ago, the President and the Cook County Board of Commissioners made
good on the pledge to taxpayers and businesses by repealing the last .25% of the so-called ‘Stroger sales
tax’; and
WHEREAS, the decision and votes to cut taxes on everyday items a majority of residents need to help
working families, toothpaste, milk, baby formula and other everyday necessities, was made as a means of
lessening the burden on them and stimulating the economy; and
WHEREAS, the tax rollback fulfilled a pledge we made to businesses that were concerned their
customers would buy goods outside Cook County and as such, not only benefited Cook County shoppers,
but also the retailers that serve them; and
WHEREAS, economic development also benefited as the tax climate is one of the many variables that
businesses consider when deciding where to create jobs; and

Page 11 of 97

 Board of Commissioners

BOARD AGENDA

September 9, 2015

WHEREAS, the cumulative effect of the sales tax rollback yielded roughly $440 million in annual
savings for taxpayers; and
WHEREAS, a sales tax is recognized as an inherently regressive tax that disproportionately impacts the
least fortunate among us; and
WHEREAS, the same arguments and reasoning used to gather support and passage of the rollback of the
regressive sales tax are just as valid today as they were then; and
WHEREAS, the recent decision to reinstate the 1% sales tax increase in its entirety restores these same
burdens on Cook County residents, families and businesses that compelled the Board to roll back this tax
in the first place; and
WHEREAS, given that the proposed 2016 budget has yet to be introduced, raising the sales tax was a
premature burdening of our taxpayers with hundreds of millions of dollars in new taxes each and every
year into perpetuity; and
WHEREAS, as a result of this action, Cook County consumers and visitors are facing a nation-leading
sales tax of between 10.25 percent and 11.25 percent. The highest rate, 11.25 percent, would be paid by
consumers in the Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority area, which makes up most of the City of
Chicago’s core; and
WHEREAS, this access to a massive influx of new taxpayer dollars will only serve to lessen pressure on
the administration of the President and on the Board to continue to seek ways to improve the efficiency,
transparency and operations of Cook County government; and
WHEREAS, in order to preserve the impetus and maintain the pressure to continue to reform county
government and reaffirm that there is more that needs to be done, and done soon, this Honorable Body
should take a proactive approach and commit to roll back this most recent sales tax increase;
NOW, THEREFORE BE IT ORDAINED, by the President and the Cook County Board of
Commissioners that Chapter 74, TAXATION, Article V. - SERVICE OCCUPATION TAX, Sections
74-190 through 74-192 be amended as follows:
ARTICLE V. - SERVICE OCCUPATION TAX
Sec. 74-190. - Short title.
This article shall be known and may be cited as the Cook County Home Rule County Service Occupation
Tax Ordinance.
Sec. 74-191. - Imposed.

regarding the subject parcel.
The Village will retain legal counsel to obtain the tax deed and bear all legal and other costs associated

Summary: The Village of Streamwood, Illinois (the “Village”), hereby requests that the County make a
no-cash bid for the following parcel. This Request Package contains one (1) PIN. The Property is located
at 160 Roma Jean Parkway, Streamwood, Illinois 60107. The Property is a vacant wooded lot. The
Village seeks to acquire the Property and hold the Property for redevelopment pending a future proposal
by a developer. The lots on both sides of the Property are owned by the Village of Streamwood. By
acquiring the Property through the Cook County No-Cash Bid Program, the Village will benefit by
owning a single contiguous property creating a greater number of alternatives for future development
thereon.
If the Village is successful in acquiring the Property through the No-Cash Bid Program, it will file for tax
exempt status and will maintain the property as tax exempt until such time as it is conveyed to a third
party for development. The Village represents that there currently exists no Third Party Request by a
developer, organization, or other private party which would result in the Village’s conveyance of a
certificate of purchase for, or perfected tax deed to, the Property to such developer, organization, or
private party. The Village authorizes and directs the Village attorneys to obtain the tax deed to this
property. The Village will bear all legal and other costs associated with the acquisition of this parcel.
The Village agrees to submit an annual report on the status of this parcel for five (5) years or until
development is complete, whichever occurs last, as required by the Cook County No-Cash Bid
Ordinance, to the Cook County Bureau of Economic Development.

03-03-301-058-0000; 231, 03-03-301-059-0000
Summary: The Village of Wheeling, (the “Village”) has targeted five locations within the Village for
vacant land redevelopment or for the use for municipal purposes. In the interest of utilizing these
properties for said purposes, the Village is seeking title to the following tax delinquent properties and
requests that the Cook County Board of Commissioners submit a No Cash Bid for all five properties on
behalf of the Village. This Request Package contains the five (5) PINs which are vacant parcels of
abandoned land at 857, 837, 817, and 802 Colonial Drive and 896 Valley Stream Drive. The Village has
determined the land to be undevelopable, but acquiring them could help aid in the development of four
parcels nearby (two Village owned parcels on Elmhurst Road and two privately owned parcels at the
west end of Colonial Drive). The land would be used by the Village for storm water management and
parking to increase the financial feasibility of developing the four adjacent parcels that are out of the
flood plain. Acquisition of the parcels will also allow the Village to address ongoing issues of creek
maintenance and public safety (the police regularly have complaints regarding the overgrown lots). In
addition, there is a good possibility of making a connection to a park to the west.
The Village does not, at the present time, have a Third Party Request by a developer, organization or
other private party, in which the Village would convey a certificate of purchase or the perfected tax deed
of the above-listed PINs to that Third Party Requestor. The Village will file for tax exempt status as long
as it retains the PINs for municipal use, maintaining that status until any tax deed either or both
properties is/are conveyed to a potential developer. The Village agrees to submit, to the Cook County
Department of Economic Development, No Cash Bid Reports on the status of each parcel for five years,
or until development is complete, whichever occurs last, as required by the Cook County No Cash Bid
Ordinance. Village of Wheeling will work to obtain the tax deeds and will bear all legal and other costs
associated with acquisition of the parcels.

JOB ORDER CONTRACT
Department:

Department of Capital Planning & Policy

Summary: The Department of Capital Planning & Policy, as authorized by the Cook County Chief
Procurement Officer, plans to participate in the Cook County’s Job Order Contract (JOC) program to
complete the two (2) capital projects listed below. JOC is a quantity based procurement process that
allows facility owners to complete a multitude of repair/maintenance and construction projects with a
single, competitively bid contract. The JOC process generally involves first selecting a pool of potential
contractors through a competitive procurement process, and then identifying projects for such selected
contractors.

Page 54 of 97

 Board of Commissioners

BOARD AGENDA

September 9, 2015

The County has already completed a JOC competitive procurement process, and it has created the pool of
generated contractors to perform certain projects generally associated with Maintenance, repairs,
replacement and routine work.
The JOC program has an administrative component managed by the Gordian Group. The Gordian Group
maintains an area price book, which captures the prices for specific construction work items within this
region. JOC contractors bid against the prices included in the price book. The cost, therefore, of any
work performed by the contractor is a contractor markup form the price book. The Gordian Group would
receive 5% administrative fee from Cook County based on the total project cost of the work. The
Gordian Group will manage the JOC process and will verify that all proposals and work are compliant
with the terms and conditions outlined in the JOC contract within the County.
The Department of Capital Planning & Policy proposes to assign the projects listed below to the Gordian
Group to share with participating JOC contractors.
Project Descriptions:
Cook County Administrative Building (CCAB) Swing Space - Basement and 9th Floor - A total gut
re-hab for the Law Offices of the Public Defender (LOPD) on the 7th, 8th and 9th floors of the
CCAB-George Leighton Administration Building. The project scope will produce an upgraded
professional work environment that adequately supports the attorneys and staff of 277 full-time
employees and 34 Interns. This project estimated cost is $240,000.00.
Medical Examiners Conference - Project scope includes the renovation of conference room and
technology at 2121 W. Harrison St. The conference room is located in the basement. Fixtures,
equipment, (Audio / Video) in the space are all original to the facility which was completed circa 1983.
Many of these systems are non-functional and obsolete and will be addressed as part of the renovation.
Project Rationale:
Cook County Administrative Building (CCAB) Swing Space - Basement and 9th Floor Construction of a swing space to relocate the Law Office of the Public Defender during construction will
be built out in the second basement of the CCAB. Renovation work is to be coordinated to develop
staging and phasing logistics to allow the Public Defender’s Office to remain operational, during
construction activities.
Medical Examiners Conference - Project was initiated to address carpet that had mildew odors due to a
past water infiltration which has since been mitigated. Upon review of the space it was noted that
various systems and components were obsolete and / or non-functional. The Medical Examiner’s office
utilizes the conference room for many functions, hosting continuing education for staff monthly, hosting a
yearly seminar for the Illinois Coroners and Medical Examiners Association, and hosting the Cook
County Disaster Response Team training seminars, to name a few. Providing
a
fully
functional
conference room will allow additional opportunities and additional use of the space for daily Quality
Assurance Case reviews, for example.

BOARD AGENDA

September 9, 2015

Summary: In December 2012, the County issued the Multi-Jurisdictional All Hazards Mitigation Plan
RFP, and Tetra Tech Inc. was awarded a contract based on established evaluation criteria. On 4/17/2013,
the Board of Commissioners approved an agreement with Tetra Tech Inc. to develop the Countywide
Hazard Mitigation Plan (HMP) on behalf of the Department of Homeland Security and Emergency
Management. On 9/10/2014, Cook County Board of County Commissioners approved the Cook County
Multi-Jurisdictional Hazard Mitigation Plan. To date, we have an 86% Planning Partner jurisdictional
plan adoption rate. To ensure success, another aspect of the HMP is creating a program to manage the
plan. With proven experience in preparing HMPs and managing planning processes, the Planning Team
elects to enter a new agreement with Tetra Tech, Inc.
Regional Inventory Central Hub: Tetra Tech initially developed the Regional Inventory Central Hub
(RICH) as part of the Chicago Regional Catastrophic Planning Team (RCPT) initiative. To complete the
database application for Cook County, the Tetra Tech team needs funding to manage the final data
upload, database migration, testing, and technical support. These final scope items could not be
accomplished because no host platform for the RICH database was identified during the RCPT’s
Logistics Project period of performance.
This is a Sole Source Procurement pursuant to Section 34-139 of the Cook County Procurement Code.

PROPOSED MISCELLANEOUS ITEM OF BUSINESS
Department:

County Clerk

Summary: Submitting for approval changes in suburban Cook County precinct boundaries under the
jurisdiction of the Cook County Clerk's Election Department. The Clerk proposes eliminating 74 voting
precincts, changing the total number from 1,673 to 1,599. This reduction represents a 4 percent decrease
in voting precincts.
The Clerk's Election Department targeted combining precincts that had low registered voters and shared
a polling place. An analysis of the precincts revealed many that were underutilized by too few voters or
that could be easily combined with other precincts.
Reducing the number of precincts and combining precincts will decrease costs associated with the Judges
of Elections, equipment programming, equipment delivery and polling place rental fees. The precinct
reduction is anticipated to save $100,000 per election in even-numbered years. In 2016, it will result in at
least $200,000 in savings.

PROPOSED TRANSFER OF FUNDS
Department: Office of the State’s Attorney
Request: requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners to transfer $215,000.00 from and to the
accounts listed below.
Reason: This transfer of funds, which represents less than one-quarter of one percent of our 2015 budget,
should be sufficient to fulfill our obligations for the remainder of the fiscal year for three accounts with
projected shortages. These accounts are: 250-217 Transportation for Specific Activities, where we have seen
higher than anticipated costs for bringing in witnesses from out of state and extraditing prisoners from other
jurisdictions; 250-232 Boarding and Lodging of Witnesses, primarily due to the cost of relocating and
protecting witnesses who are threatened; and 250-268 Court Reporting Services, where expenditures for court
transcripts have been slightly higher than projected.

From Account(s): 250-441, $40,000.00; 250-445, $175,000.00.
To Account(s): 250-217, $90,000.00; 250-232, $75,000.00; 250-268, $50,000.00.
Total Amount of Transfer: $215,000.00
On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
On 8/1, Account 217 had a balance of approximately $25,000; on July 1st the balance was approximately
$105,000.
On 7/1, Account 232 had a balance of approximately $13,000; on June 1st the balance was
approximately $65,000.
On 8/1, Account 268 had a balance of approximately $200,000; on July 1st the balance was
approximately $415,000.
How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
These were the accounts, based on current year to date spending and known obligations, which were
projected as most likely to have remaining balances at year end.
Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from.
None.
If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
Although spending fluctuates from year to year in many accounts, our original budget requests were
based on our best projections at that time.
