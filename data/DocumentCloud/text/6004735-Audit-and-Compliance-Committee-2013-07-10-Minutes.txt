**Report from System Corporate Compliance Officer (Attachment #1)
A. File quarterly statistics on reactive compliance issues
B. File status of FY2013 work plan activities
C. Provide update on Information Security – internal and external environment
D. Review draft Corporate Compliance Steering Committee Charter
Cathy Bodnar, System Corporate Compliance and Privacy Officer, presented her report containing the
following: quarterly statistics on reactive compliance issues; status of FY2013 work plan activities; and
Update on Information Security, internal and external environment. The Committee reviewed and discussed
the information.
Ms. Bodnar stated that there is an issue that she would like to address and bring to the Committee’s attention,
regarding an allegation of false claims in relation to the 340B Drug Pricing Program. The 340B Drug
Pricing Program is a Federal program, managed under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,
through the Health Resources Services Administration (HRSA) - specifically their Office of Pharmacy
Affairs (OPA).

**Report from System Corporate Compliance Officer (continued)
The 340B Program requires drug manufacturers to provide outpatient drugs to enrolled covered entities at or
below the statutorily defined ceiling price; there is a significant discount for the System’s participation in
this. The purpose of the Program (from HRSA’s OPA website) is “to stretch scarce federal resources as far
as possible, reaching more eligible patients and providing more comprehensive services.” Covered entities
get incredibly deep discounts on 340B purchased drugs that are then dispensed to patients who receive health
care services from 340B covered entities. The services that the System’s patients receive cannot be just the
dispensing of the drugs alone, they must receive care here within the System.
Under the definition, both Stroger and Provident Hospitals meet the definition of a covered entity through
their designation as a disproportionate share hospital. There is an enrollment process that must occur that
includes submissions of each hospital’s Medicare Cost Report to support its claim of being a
disproportionate share hospital. Similarly, enrollment must occur within the System’s outpatient clinics.
Outpatient clinics are defined as being located outside the four walls of the hospital. In addition to
submissions of collateral material to support the registration for the hospitals to be participants in the 340B
Program, submission of material also must be done for the outpatient clinics. Participation in the 340B
Program is a huge savings to the System –approximately $50 million annually.
Ms. Bodnar stated that issues have been identified with the System’s participation in the Program.
Historically, all three of the System’s hospitals were registered on the HRSA OPA site. Unfortunately, due
to administrative error, Oak Forest Hospital was not removed from the site when the hospital was deactivated as providing acute care hospital services. Similarly, it was identified that the outpatient clinics
were not registered as “child sites,” as well. When this was identified, staff immediately contacted HRSA
OPA. It was verbally disclosed to them that there was an issue with Oak Forest Hospital; this was followed
by with a letter that was authored by Dr. Shannon and Ms. Bodnar. Ms. Bodnar stated that Rhonda Yates,
System Director of Pharmacy, has been significant in identifying this issue for the System and in
implementing all of the corrective measures, so that the System can be in compliance with 340B Program
requirements.
Ms. Bodnar stated that, on a quarterly basis, HRSA allows for the registration of sites. On April 3rd, System
staff registered the outpatient clinics, with the exception of Oak Forest Health Center. HRSA OPA reviews
the registrations during a quarter. Staff expected the outpatient clinics to be active on July 1st, however, this
was not the case - HRSA OPA placed the System’s registrations on hold. Significant financial ramifications
will occur with the suspension of 340B Program purchases. There is active, ongoing dialogue with
representatives of HRSA OPA; the administration has discussed with them that the System is absolutely
committed to comply with 340B Program requirements. They have agreed to discuss and address the issues
of why the registrations were put on hold; she noted that the administration was told that the registrations
were put on hold, but was not told why. Ms. Bodnar indicated that the administration is addressing these
issues rapidly.
Ms. Bodnar stated that there are issues relating to mixed use areas that that serve both inpatient and
outpatient populations. The System has historically instituted a manual audit process, but Ms. Yates has
recognized that this is not sufficient; the intent is to obtain 340B split billing software that will assist with
mixed use areas.
Ms. Bodnar stated that, additionally, pharmaceutical manufacturers have audited the System regarding the
340B Program. Two of the audits were desk audits, where they reviewed off-site; one audit occurred on-site.
Two of the three audits did have findings and potentially paybacks, as well.

**Report from System Corporate Compliance Officer (continued)
Ms. Bodnar stated that the administration is implementing corrective measures. They continue to develop
and implement policies and procedures, and perform ongoing education within the pharmacy area; an
additional component that is being considered is to establish auditable records for pharmaceuticals.
Following the Committee’s discussion of the issue relating to the 340B Program, Ms. Bodnar continued with
her report as presented. Chairman Muñoz inquired further regarding policy and procedure relating to record
retention. Ms. Bodnar stated that she can provide further information regarding the specific regulatory
guidelines relating to record retention.
The following individuals provided an overview of the information regarding Information Security: Scott
Ellis, System Information Security Officer, and Dr. Bala Hota, System Chief Information Officer. The
Committee reviewed the information.

Donald Croswell, of Washington, Pittman & McKeever, LLP, reviewed the information relating to the
System contained in the Cook County Single Audit Report on Federal Awards, for the fiscal year ended
November 30, 2012. The Committee discussed the information.
Gina Besenhofer, System Director of Supply Chain Management, provided additional information relating to
findings contained in the Single Audit Report. She stated that one of the contracts that was audited was a
contract with More Direct. This is a Health System contract - staff did not realize that the Department of
Public Health was utilizing More Direct as well for some of their purchases, so they did not go back and
amend the language to include the federal clauses that were necessary.
Ms. Besenhofer stated that staff has been retrained to be able to identify that type of issue. She stated that
staff is working with the legal department to ensure that the contract language is compliant. She noted that,
with regard to the monitoring of the vendors against the Federal Excluded Parties List System (EPLS), this is
done on a monthly basis by Contract Compliance. This was not included in the contract file with the contract
documents.

INDEPENDENT REPORT
ON SCHEDULE OF EXPENDITURES OF FEDERAL AWARDS

To the Board of Commissioners of
Cook County, Illinois

We have audited the accompanying Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards (Schedule) of
Cook County, Illinois (the County) for the year ended November 30, 2012. This financial
statement is the responsibility of the County?s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on the financial statement based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United
States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government
Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States; and OMB Circular
A-133, ?Audits of States. Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations?. Those standards
and OMB Circular A?l33 require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the ?nancial statement is free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statement. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
signi?cant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall ?nancial statement
presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Note 2, the County prepares the Schedule on the cash basis, which is a
comprehensive basis of accounting other than accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America.

In our opinion, the ?nancial statement referred to above presents fairly, in all material respects,
the expenditures of Federal awards of the County for the year ended November 30, 2012 in
conformity with the basis of accounting described in Note2

NOTES TO SCHEDULE OF EXPENDITURES OF FEDERAL AWARDS

FOR THE YEAR ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2012

NOTE 1 - FINANCIAL REPORTING

The accompanying Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards (Schedule) includes all Federal
programs attributable to the County?s reporting entity except those administered by the Forest
Preserve District of Cook County and its component units.

The information in this Schedule is presented in accordance with the requirements of the Single
Audit Act Amendments of 1996 and OMB Circular A-133, ?Audits of States, Local Governments,
and Non-Pro?t Organizations? Therefore, some amounts presented in this Schedule may differ
from amounts presented in, or used in the preparation of, the basic ?nancial statements.

Federal awards received directly from Federal agencies, as well as the Federal portion of grants
passed through non-federal agencies, are included in the Schedule.

NOTE 2 - BASIS OF ACCOUNTING

The accompanying Schedule has been prepared on the cash basis of accounting in which
expenditures are recorded when actually paid.

Accordingly, the accompanying Schedule is not intended to present ?nancial position and the

results of operations in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America.

NOTE 3 - MAJOR PROGRAMS

Major programs are those programs identified in the Summary of Auditor?s Results section of the
accompanying Schedule of Findings and Questioned Costs, which were determined using a risk
based approach in accordance with the requirements of OMB Circular A 133.

NOTE 4 PAYMENTS TO SUBRECIPIENTS

NOTE 5 NON-CASH AWARDS

Non-cash awards identi?ed during the current period have been included in the Schedule. The
County had no non-cash Federally-funded insurance, and loans and/or loan guarantees in effect
during ?scal year 2012.

NOTE 6 NEGATIVE EXPENDITURES

The Schedule includes negative amounts that result from timing differences caused by the process
of authorizing new grants and assigning business units. The County assigns each new grant a
business unit. Expenditures for new grants are accumulated in the prior year?s grant/business unit
until the new grant/business unit has been authorized/assigned. Once the new grant/business unit
has been authorized/assigned, expenditures applicable to the new grant, previously recorded in
the prior year grant/business unit, are transferred to the new business unit. When the authorization
of a new grant occurs in the subsequent ?scal year (after the normal year-end closing), the
transfer of the expenditures from the prior year business unit to the new grant/business unit
results in a negative expenditure in the prior year business unit.

During the current fiscal year, the County performed an analysis of grants that remained open but
had no activity and anticipated no future activities. This analysis resulted in additional credits to
the Schedule to correct grant amounts which were determined to be over expended in prior ?scal
years.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED NOVEMBER 30. 2012
NOTE 7 DCEO AUDITS

The Illinois Department of Commerce Economic Opportunity (DCEO) issued its report (dated
July 28, 2011 of the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) ?scal monitoring findings identi?ed for
the period of 06/16/2010 through 06/30/2011 at the President?s Of?ce of Employment Training
(POET) and its successor agency, Cook County Works].

The letter detailed ?ndings on POET and sixteen (16) service providers that resulted in POET
questioned costs of $529,478, POET disallowed costs of $128,188, and service provider
questioned costs of $890,460.

The letter requested a written response from POET regarding these ?ndings and corrective
actions by August 23, 2011 and that the corrective actions contained in the response are
implemented by September 3, 2011 or as speci?ed in the corrective action, if earlier. Any
additional eligibility documentation was to be submitted no later than August 23, 2011.

POET submitted a response to DCEO on August 23, 2011. Based on determinations made by
DCEO and the U.S. Department of Labor (U.S. DOL), POET was assessed disallowed costs in
the amount of $1,562,820 pertaining to the 2009 Summer Youth program which was funded with
ARRA funds.

In January 2011, in accordance with directives issued to the previous administration to reorganize
POET, the Preckwinkle administration began assessing numerous aspects of operations
and management, including staf?ng, ?scal and programmatic policies and procedures. During the
course of this review, the administration became aware of allegations of fraud within the 2009
and 2010 Summer Youth Programs.

This matter was then turned over to the County?s Independent Inspector General and
subsequently taken over by the US. Attorney?s Office (US. A0.) for investigation. It is worth
noting that as a result of state programmatic audit ?ndings released in 2010, 2009 and
2010 Summer Youth Programs had been under investigation by the US Office of the
Inspector General. US. DOL, in conjunction with the US. A.O, conducted a thorough review of
these programs which resulted in the indictment of four former POET employees and subsequent
guilty pleas. Disallowed costs for 2010 have yet to be determined. The County will ultimately be
liable for any disallowed costs stemming from the Federal investigation.

As a result of the agency?s history and high risk status, POET was completely restructured and
renamed Cook County Works (CCW). Effective December 2, 2011, CCW ceased to operate as a
direct service provider and focused exclusively on the administration of the Workforce
Investment Act grant, while developing programming aimed at aligning job training with existing
and projected employment opportunities for Cook County residents.

 

Cook County Works was of?cially launched on December 2, 2011 as the successor agency to POET. The
restructured agency ceased to provide case management/direct services to employment training clients in
accordance with mandated restructuring.

NOTE 7 DCEO AUDITS (Continued)

In October 2011, Cook County Board President Toni R. Preckwinkle announced that the City and
County?s workforce systems would combine to create one uni?ed system for all of Cook County,
inclusive of the City of Chicago. The new administrative agency, The Chicago Cook Workforce
Partnership, was launched on July 1, 2012.

As detailed in numerous Inter-governmental Agreements, the County, the City, and the State of
Illinois agreed to be responsible for any de?ciencies or acts of the prior-existing workforce
administrative agencies.

NOTE 8 HUD AUDITS

Cook County's HOME program was monitored in December of 2011. The monitoring
resulted in four Findings and two Concerns. A letter conveying the results of the review was
provided to Cook County on February 28, 2012. The Findings included the County not
adhering to site/neighborhood standards, record maintenance, on-site inspections and
eligibility records. HUD received a response letter from the County dated March 28, 2012.

The Findings have not, yet, been resolved. The County is in consultation with HUD staff to clear
the Findings. HUD is in the process of reviewing a draft of the County's most current
monitoring response and providing technical assistance before the County makes its ?nal
response

Coungg Response: The County has addressed these ?ndings in a response dated April 11 
2013 and is currently awaiting a formal clearance letter from HUD and will follow-up
immediately regarding anticipated receipt of said clearance.

NOTE 9 US. DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY AUDIT

The US. Department of Homeland Security?s (DHS) Of?ce of the Inspector General (OIG)
issued a draft audit report in August 2011. Under the direction of the new Executive Director of
the Cook County Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management (DHSEM), the
DHSEM conducted an internal audit of the program and provided the DHS OIG with comments
on the draft report in late September 2011. The ?nal report was issued by the DHS 016 in
December 2011. This report contained four (4) recommendations and concluded that the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the State of Illinois, the Urban Area Working Group,
and Cook County did not ensure the effective implementation of Project Shield. As of the date of
this report, the DHSEM continues to work with the Illinois Emergency Management Agency and
the US. DHS to resolve the findings outlined in the OIG Audit Report.

NOTE 10 SUBSE UENT EVENT
HUD Loan Guarantee Program

Cook County received approval from the US. Department of Housing and Urban Development
(HUD) for a $30 million loan guarantee program to ?nance four types of sustainable
development. They are: transit-oriented, mixed-use developments within a half-mile of passenger
rail; cargo-oriented projects near freight rail lines and terminals; mixed-use hospitality/service
sector projects near transit lines and business development loans.

Also known as the Section 108 Loan Pool, BUILT (Broadening Urban Investment to Leverage
Transportation) in Cook will allow the County to borrow money from private investors at reduced
interest rates to promote economic development, stimulate job growth and improve public
facilities. Such public investment is often needed to inspire private contributions, to provide seed
money, or to simply boost con?dence that many private ?rms and individuals need to invest in
distressed areas.

INDEPENDENT REPORT ON COMPLIANCE

WITH QUIREMENTS THAT COULD HAVE A DIRECT AND MATERIAL EFFECT

ON EACH MAJOR PROGRAM AND ON INTERNAL CONTROL
OVER COMPLIANCE IN ACCORDANCE WITH

OMB CIRCULAR A-133

To the Board of Commissioners of
Cook County, Illinois

Compliance

We have audited Cook County, Illinois? (the County) compliance with the types of compliance
requirements described in the US. Of?ce of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-133
Compliance Supplement that could have a direct and material effect on each of the County?s
major Federal programs for the year ended November 30, 2012. The County?s major Federal
programs are identi?ed in the Summary of Auditor?s Results section of the accompanying
Schedule of Findings and Questioned Costs. Compliance with the requirements of laws,
regulations, contracts, and grants applicable to each of its major Federal programs is the
responsibility of the County?s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
County?s compliance based on our audit.

The County?s basic ?nancial statements include the operations of the Cook County Sheriff?s
Police Department and the Office of the State?s Attorney. The Cook County Sheriff? 5 Police
Department received $1,955,323 Federal forfeiture awards, which is not included in the Schedule
during the year ended November 30, 2012. The Of?ce of the State?s Attorney reported that its
expenditures of Federal forfeiture awards for the year ended November 30, 2012 was below the
threshold required for an audit in accordance with OMB Circular A-133. Our audit, described
below, did not include the Federal forfeiture awards of the Cook County Sheriff?s Police
Department because the department engaged other auditors to perform an audit in accordance
with OMB Circular A-133.

We conducted our audit of compliance in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America; the standards applicable to ?nancial audits contained in
Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States; and
OMB Circular A-l33, ?Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Pro?t Organizations?.
Those standards and OMB Circular require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether noncompliance with the types of compliance requirements
referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on a major Federal program
occurred. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence about the County?s compliance
18
Page 51 of 128

with those requirements and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our audit
does not provide a legal determination of the County?s compliance with those requirements.

In our opinion, the County complied, in all material respects, with the compliance requirements
referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on each of its major Federal
programs for the year ended November 30, 2012. However, the results of our auditing
procedures disclosed instances of noncompliance with those requirements, which are required to
be reported in accordance with OMB Circular A-133 and which are described in the
accompanying Schedule of Findings and Questioned Costs as items 2012 1, 2012 3, 2012 4,
2012 5,2012 6,2012 7,2012 8,2012 9,2012 10,2012 11, 2012 12,2012 13,
2012 14,2012 15, 2012 16, 2012 17,2012 18, 2012 19, 2012 20, and 2012 21.

Internal Control Over Compliance

Management of the County is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal
control over compliance with the requirements of laws, regulations, contracts, and grants
applicable to Federal programs. In planning and performing our audit, we considered the
County?s internal control over compliance with the requirements that could have a direct and
material effect on a major program to determine the auditing procedures for the purpose of
expressing our opinion on compliance and to test and report on internal control over compliance
in accordance with OMB Circular A-133, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of internal control over compliance. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on
the effectiveness of the County?s internal control over compliance.

A de?ciency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control
over compliance does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing
their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, noncompliance with a type of
compliance requirement of a Federal program on a timely basis. A material weakness in internal
control over compliance is a de?ciency, or combination of de?ciencies, in internal control over
compliance, such that there is a reasonable possibility that material noncompliance with a type of
compliance requirement of a Federal program will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on
a timely basis.

Our consideration of internal control over compliance was for the limited purpose described in
the first paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal
control that might be de?ciencies, signi?cant de?ciencies, or material weaknesses. We did not
identify any deficiencies in internal control over compliance that we consider to be material
weaknesses, as defined above. However, we identified certain de?ciencies in internal control over
compliance that we consider to be signi?cant de?ciencies as described in the accompanying
Schedule of Findings and Questioned Costs as items 2012 2, 2012 3, 2012 4, 2012 5, 2012
6, 2012 7,2012 8,2012 9, 2012 10, 2012 12,2012 13,2012 14,2012 15,2012 
16, 2012 17, 2012 18, 2012 19, 2012 20, and 2012 21. A signi?cant de?ciency in
internal control over compliance is a de?ciency, or a combination of de?ciencies, in internal
control over compliance with a type of compliance requirement of a Federal program that is less
severe than a material weakness in internal control over compliance, yet important enough to
merit attention by those charged with governance.

The County?s responses to the findings identi?ed in our audit are described in the accompanying
Schedule of Findings and Questioned Costs. We did not audit the County?s responses and,
accordingly, we express no opinion on the responses.

19
Page 52 of 128

The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of compliance with the
types of compliance requirements applicable to each of the County?s major programs and our
testing of internal control over compliance and the results of our testing, and to provide an
opinion on the County?s compliance but not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the
County?s internal control over compliance. This report is an integral part of an audit performed in
accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the County?s compliance with
requirements applicable to each major program and its internal control over compliance.
Accordingly, this report is not suitable for any other purpose.

CRITERIA

2 CFR Part 225 (OMB Circular Appendix C, requires that all local governments claiming
central service costs must develop a cost allocation plan in accordance with the requirements
described in this Circular and retain the plan and related supporting documentation for audit.
?Each local government that has been designated as a "major local government" by the Office of
Management and Budget (OMB) is also required to submit a plan to its cognizant agency
annually. OMB periodically lists major local governments in the Federal Register.? ?All central
service cost allocation plans will be prepared and, when required, submitted within six months
prior to the beginning of each of the governmental unit's ?scal years in which it proposes to claim
central service costs. Extensions may be granted by the cognizant agency on a case-by-case
basis.? ?All proposed plans must be accompanied by the following: an organization chart
suf?ciently detailed to show operations including the central service activities of the State/local
government whether or not they are shown as bene?ting from central service functions; a copy of
the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (or a copy of the Executive Budget if budgeted costs
are being proposed) to support the allowable costs of each central service activity included in the
plan; and, a certi?cation that the plan was prepared in accordance with this Circular, contains
only allowable costs, and was prepared in a manner that treated similar costs consistently among
the various Federal awards and between Federal and non-federal awards/activities.?

?For each allocated central service, the plan must also include the following: a brief description of
the service, an identi?cation of the unit rendering the service and the operating agencies receiving

each service to the specific bene?ted agencies. If any self-insurance funds or fringe bene?ts costs
are treated as allocated (rather than billed) central services, documentation shall also be

CONDITION

The County?s County-wide cost allocation plan (CAP) was received by its cognizant agency, the
US. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) subsequent to the end of the current
Fiscal year. HUD granted the County an extension until December 12, 2012 to submit the 2012
CAP.

The CAP submitted by the County did not comply with the requirements of OMB Circular

Finding 2012 1 (Continued)

 

CONTEXT
During our test procedures we noted the following:
The certi?cation included with the CAP did not refer to the correct Fiscal Year.

0 The CAP did not contain the required organizational chart suf?ciently detailed to show
operations including the central service activities of the County, and whether or not they
are shown as bene?ting from central service functions.

0 We requested and were not provided documentation supporting the amounts and
methodologies contained in the CAP.

ELIE

Based on discussions with County management, the primary staff responsible for preparation of
the CAP is no longer with the County. The timing of this staff turnover impacted the submission
of the CAP as well as the maintenance of adequate supporting documentation.

EFFECT

The failure to submit the organizational chart as required is a violation of Federal regulations. The
failure to adequately maintain documentation supporting the amounts and methodologies
contained in the CAP could result in unallowable costs being allocated to the County?s Federally-
funded programs.

RECOMMENDATION

We recommend the County allocate the appropriate resources to ensure that all costs of
centralized services charged to Federal programs are supported by a current centralized CAP that
meets the requirements described in OMB Circular A-87. Submitted should include a
transmittal letter documenting the date of submission and all included documents that are
required by Federal regulations.

CRITERIA

Federal regulations (7 CFR Section require sub-grantees to take a physical inventory
of all storage facilities. Such inventory shall be reconciled annually with the storage facility?s
inventory records and maintained on file by the agency. Corrective action shall be taken
immediately on all de?ciencies and the results of the corrective action forwarded to the
distributing agency.

The Juvenile Temporary Detention Center?s (JTDC) Policies and Procedure Manual (Policy 
2.13) requires them to: 1) Maintain an accurate inventory record for government food
commodities which shall be kept separate from the purchased food inventory. Government
commodities shall be utilized before purchased food; 2) Conduct a inventory to be
submitted ?ve business days after the end of each month, and 3) Conduct a yearly inventory no
later than December 10th of each year.

CONDITION

During the current audit period, the JTDC failed to comply with 7 CFR Section 250.14 and its
policy 2.13.

CONTEXT

Based on our review, we were unable to obtain evidence that a physical inventory of commodities
was completed during the current year. As a result, we could not determine if the physical
inventory was reconciled with Inventory Report.



Failure to perform a physical inventory and reconcile the physical inventory to the inventory
records is a violation of Federal regulations and could result in the misstatement of perpetual
records and the improper distribution or loss of purchased and/or donated commodities.

CAUSE

Based on discussions with County management, staff was unaware of the requirement to maintain
suf?cient documentation of commodity inventory by the food services department.

CRITERIA

In accordance with the requirements of the Davis-Bacon Act and the DOL regulations (29 CFR
Part 5, ?Labor Standards Provisions Applicable to Contacts Governing Federally Financed and
Assisted Construction?), non-federal entities shall include in their construction contracts a
requirement that the contractor or subcontractor comply with the Davis-Bacon Act. This includes
a requirement for the contractor or subcontractor submit to the non-federal entity weekly, for each
week in which any contract work is performed, a certified copy of the payroll and a statement of
compliance (29 CFR sections 5.5 and 5.6).

OMB Circular A-133 Subpart Section .300(b) requires auditees to maintain internal control
over Federal programs that provides reasonable assurance that the auditee is managing Federal
awards in compliance with laws, regulations, and the provisions of the contracts or grant
agreements that could have a material effect on each of its Federal programs.

CONDITION

During the current audit period, the Department of Planning and Development (DPD) did not
adequately document its compliance with Federal Davis-Bacon requirements for the CDBG
program.

CONTEXT

Based on our testing, we noted no evidence of review of weekly certi?ed payrolls for ten (10) of
the fourteen (14) contractors? ?les selected.

We also noted no evidence of a preconstruction conference held for three (3) of the files tested.
EFFECT

Failure to review certi?ed payrolls submitted by contractors is a violation of Federal regulations
and impairs the ability to adequately monitor the Federally funded program. The failure to
hold preconstruction conferences impacts the communication of Federal requirements and could
result in violations of Federal regulations.

CAUSE

Based on discussions with management, it appears that these certi?ed payrolls are collected and
reviewed. However, documentation of this review was not consistently prepared and placed in the
related ?les. Similarly, preconstruction conferences are held for every capital project. However,
standardized documentation such as an agenda and sign-in sheet are not consistently prepared and
placed in the related ?les.

RECOMMENDATIONS

We recommend the DPD establish written policies and procedures to ensure its compliance with
the Davis-Bacon Act requirements and ensure the documentation of procedures performed are
appropriately maintained. Also, we recommend that current staff is appropriately trained. In
addition, supporting documentation on preconstruction conferences held should be maintained.

subrecipient's audit report and ensure that the subrecipient takes appropriate and timely corrective
action; (6) consider whether subrecipient audits necessitate adjustment of the pass-through
entity's own records; and (7) require each subrecipient to permit the pass-through entity and
auditors to have access to the records and ?nancial statements as necessary for the pass-through
entity to comply with this part. In cases of continued inability or unwillingness of a subrecipient
to have the required audits, the pass-through entity shall take appropriate action using sanctions.

Also, OMB Circular A-133 Subpart Section .405(a) states that the management decision shall
clearly state whether or not the audit ?nding is sustained, the reasons for the decision, and the
expected auditee action to repay disallowed costs, make financial adjustments, or take other
action. If the auditee has not completed corrective action, a timetable for follow?up should be
given. Prior to issuing the management decision, the Federal agency or pass-through entity may
request additional information or documentation from the auditee, including a request for auditor
assurance related to the documentation, as a way of mitigating disallowed costs. The management
decision should describe any appeal process available to the auditee.

Per the County?s subrecipient contract agreements, projects must be completed within twelve
months from the ?Notice to Proceed? (NTP) date. If projects are not completed within the
required time frame the subrecipient should communicate the delay to the Department of
Planning and Development (DPD). If the delay is considered reasonable a waiver is issued
granting an extension.

CONDITION

During the current audit period, the DPD did not adequately document its procedures for the
monitoring of subrecipients, which resulted in the noncompliance with Federal regulations. Also,
there were no procedures to ensure timely completion of projects.

CONTEXT
During our review of ?fty-?ve (55) subrecipients? files, we noted the following:

0 Eight (8) subrecipients? ?les had no documentation of review of A-133 audits received.
The DPD did not issue a management decision on audit findings in accordance with
OMB Circular A-133 Subpart Section .405(a), nor did the DPD ensure the
subrecipient took appropriate corrective actions on all audit ?ndings.

CONTEXT 1 Continued 

Fourteen (14) subrecipients? contracts did not contain the CFDA number.

0 Eighteen (18) subrecipient ?les did not document whether the DPD performed the
required annual on-site review and monitoring visit for projects either open or completed
during FY 2012.

During our testing of thirty-?ve (35) project ?les (25 completed and 10 open projects) during
fiscal year 2012, we noted the following:

0 Three (3) projects remained open beyond the twelfth month of the notice to proceed
(NTP) completion date requirement. Also, we noted no waiver issued granting an
extension.

0 Due to lack of documentation, we were unable to determine when the project was
completed for eight (8) projects.

EFFECT

Failure to adequately monitor the activities and performance of subrecipients could result in
Federal awards being used for unauthorized purposes and the inability to adequately
perform risk assessments on subrecipients.

Failure to complete projects or services in the stated allowable time is a violation of the contract
agreement and impairs various communities? ability to benefit from the project or service.
Additionally, failure to complete projects timely impacts the ability to carry out its CDBG
activities and certi?cations in accordance with Federal regulations (24 CFR sections 570.901 and
570.902).

CAUSE
Based on discussions with management, the implementation of new and written procedures in

compliance with OMB Circular A-133 did not begin until the end of the Fiscal Year due to staff
turnover.

CONDITION

During the current audit period, Department of Planning and Development (DPD) did not
adequately ensure municipalities receiving funds provided citizens with reasonable notice and an
opportunity to comment on performance reports, within the 15 day minimum period.

CONTEXT

During our test of 7 subrecipients? ?les, we noted no evidence that municipalities held a
performance meeting that provided an opportunity for citizens to comment within the 15 days
minimum period prior to the submission of the performance report to HUD.

Also, the DPD does not have a tracking or monitoring system in place to ensure municipalities
held the required performance meeting prior to submission of the performance report to
HUD.

In November 2012 the DPD changed its procedures to no longer require municipalities to hold
performance meetings. However, we were provided no evidence of documentation of the
new policy to ensure compliance with the December 2012 submission of the performance report
to HUD.

EFFECT

Failure to maintain supporting documentation of the required performance meeting prior to
submission of the performance report to HUD impairs the grantor agency?s ability to
monitor 5 program performance.

CAUSE
Based on discussions with management, this occurred due to a change in the policy to no longer

require municipalities to hold performance meetings. This change occurred near the end of the
current year which did not allow adequate time for the implementation of the new policy.

RECOMMENDATION

We recommend DPD immediately implement its new policies and procedures to ensure
compliance with Federal regulations and maintain adequate supporting documentation of the
completion and review of the citizen participation plan as required.

CONTEXT

Based on our testing of seven (7) contractors? ?les, we reviewed fourteen (14) certified payrolls
and noted no evidence of review for the 14 certi?ed payrolls.

Failure to review certi?ed payrolls submitted by contractors is a violation of Federal regulations
and impairs ability to adequately monitor the Federally funded program.

CAUSE

Based on discussions with management, this situation was the result of staff turnover and the
unfamiliarity with Federal Davis-Bacon requirements by current staff.

RECOMMENDATIONS

We recommend the DPD establish policies and procedures to ensure its compliance with the
requirements of the Davis Bacon Act. These policies and procedures should ensure certi?ed
payrolls are reviewed timely and the documentation of procedures performed is appropriately
maintained. Also, we recommend that current staff is appropriately trained.

Eligbility

The HOME Program has income targeting requirements. Only low-income or very low-income
persons, as de?ned in 24 CFR Section 92.2, can receive housing assistance (24 CFR Section
92.1). Therefore, the participating jurisdiction must determine if each family is income eligible
by determining the family?s annual income, as provided for in 24 CFR Section 92.203.
Participating jurisdictions must maintain records for each family assisted (24 CFR section
92.508).

The income determinations are as follows:

The HOME program has income targeting requirements for the HOME program and for
HOME projects. Therefore, the participating jurisdiction must determine each family is income
eligible by determining the family's annual income.
(1) For families who are tenants in HOME?assisted housing and not receiving HOME tenant-
based rental assistance, the participating jurisdiction must initially determine annual income
using the method in paragraph of this section. For subsequent income determinations
during the period of affordability, the participating jurisdiction may use any one of the
following methods in accordance with 92.2521h) 
Examine the source documents evidencing annual income wage statement, interest
statement, unemployment compensation statement) for the family.
(ii) Obtain from the family a written statement of the amount of the family's annual income
and family size, along with a certi?cation that the information is complete and accurate.
The certi?cation must state that the family will provide source documents upon request.
Obtain a written statement from the administrator of a government program under
which the family receives bene?ts and which examines each year the annual income of the
family. The statement must indicate the tenant's family size and state the amount of the
family's annual income; or alternatively, the statement must indicate the current dollar limit
for very low- or low-income families for the family size of the tenant and state that the
tenant's annual income does not exceed this limit.
(2) For all other families, the participating jurisdiction must determine annual income by
examining the source documents evidencing annual income wage statement, interest
statement, unemployment compensation statement) for the family.
When determining whether a family is income eligible, the participating jurisdiction must use
one of the following three de?nitions of ?annual income?:
(1) ?Annual income? as de?ned at 24 CFR 5.609 (except when determining the income of a
homeowner for an owner-occupied rehabilitation project, the value of the homeowner?s

3. Housing Status: the household must be either homeless (to receive rapid re-housing
assistance) OR at risk of losing its housing (to received homelessness prevention
assistance);

In addition to assessing and documenting income and the current housing situation of
applicant housings, grantees and subgrantees must also assess whether the household
would be homeless ?But for? HPRP assistance. This requires grantees and subgrantees to
work with participants to assess and document the additional three circumstances listed
below:

a. No appropriate subsequent housing options have been identified;

b. The household lacks the ?nancial resources to obtain immediate housing or
remain in its existing housing; and

c. The household lacks support networks needed to obtain immediate housing or
remain in its existing housing.

HUD requires grantees and/or subgrantees to evaluate and certify the eligibility of HPRP program
participants at entrance into the program and at least once every 3 months for all households
receiving HPRP medium-term rental assistance or other HPRP services case management)
lasting longer than 3 months.

The HUD Guide also requires that the Staff Certi?cation of Eligibility for HPRP Assistance must
be maintained in each HPRP participant?s ?le and is subject to review by HUD. Grantees must
use the HUD-speci?c form (including the HUD logo), and not simply reproduce copies that
incorporate prescribed language. The Staff Certi?cation must be completed for each
household deemed eligible for HPRP assistance. This form certi?es that the household meets all
eligibility criteria for HPRP assistance, that true and complete information was used to determine
eligibility, and that no con?ict of interest exists related to the provision of HPRP assistance. The
Staff Certi?cation of Eligibility form must be completed and signed by the person determining
eligibility and his or her supervisor for all households determined eligible or recerti?ed on or
after November I, 2009. A new Staff Certi?cation is only required if a different staff person re-
certifies eligibility at a later date.

CRITERIA (Continued)

In addition, the HUD Guide states a written lease is required for all program participants
receiving on-going ?nancial assistance and staff must document efforts to obtain a written lease.
If a written lease does not exist and/or cannot be adequately documented, a new written lease
must be executed and documented in the case ?le before any on-going ?nancial assistance is
provided. Grantees and subgrantees should note that while HUD allows for various types of
documentation, self-declaration and third-party veri?cation of an oral lease cannot be used as a
substitute for a written lease when providing on-going financial assistance.

CONDITION

During the current audit period, the Department of Planning and Development (DPD) did not
adequately document its compliance with Federal eligibility requirements for the HPRP program.

CONTEXT
During our testing of twenty-nine (29) participants? ?les, we noted the following:

0 For seven (7) participants? ?les, there was no documentary evidence of eligibility
determinations. As such, we were unable to determine if the household's total income
meets the eligibility requirements, or if household is either homeless or at risk of losing
its housing.

0 Five (5) participant files contained no evidence that an initial consultation and eligibility
assessment was performed.

0 Three (3) participant ?les contained no evidence that redeterminations were performed
every 3 months.

0 Seven (7) participant ?les contained no evidence that; 1) a written lease was obtained, 2)
an HPRP Staff Certi?cation of Eligibility for HPRP Assistance form was maintained in
the file, and 3) "But For" determinations were performed.

EFFECT

Failure to adequately perform the required eligibility determinations is a violation of Federal
regulations.

CAUSE

Based on discussions with management, this situation is the result of administrative oversight.

CRITERIA 1 Continued!

DPD has developed policies and procedures to monitor its subrecipients based on monitoring
visits documented by the proper completion and supervisory review of a HPRP Case File Review
Checklist.

CONDITION

During the current audit period, the Department of Planning and Development (DPD) did not
document its procedures for monitoring its subrecipients, which resulted in the noncompliance
with Federal regulations.

CONTEXT

During our review of four (4) subrecipients? ?les, we noted the following:

0 Four (4) subrecipient contracts did not contain the CFDA number.

I Four (4) subrecipient files did not contain evidence as to whether supervisory review
was performed on the HPRP Case File Review Checklist during the audit period.



Failure to adequately monitor the activities and performance of subrecipients could result in
Federal awards being used for unauthorized purposes as well as inability to adequately
perform risk assessments on subrecipients.

CAUSE

Based on discussions with management, this situation is due to staff turnover which lead to a lack
of administrative oversight.

RECOMMENDATION

We recommend DPD establish and implement policies and procedures to ensure all subrecipient
contracts include all applicable Federal requirements. Also, procedures should be implemented to
document the supervisory review of Subrecipient information, including the HPRP Case File
Review Checklist.

CONTEXT

During our testing of three (3) close-out reports, we noted two (2) of the three close-out reports
were submitted 9 days late.

EFFECT

Failure to timely submit the required close-out reports is a violation of the Interagency Agreement
and impairs the grantor agency?s ability to adequately monitor grant activities.

CAUSE

Based on discussions with management, this appears to be an oversight on the part of ?scal

request additional information or documentation from the auditee, including a request for auditor
assurance related to the documentation, as a way of mitigating disallowed costs. The management
decision should describe any appeal process available to the auditee.

CONDITION

During the current audit period, the State?s Attorney Of?ce (SAO) did not comply with Federal
requirements for the monitoring of subreceipients of the Violence Against Women (VAW)

CONTEXT
During our test of eleven (11) subrecipients? ?les, we noted the following:

0 We were unable to verify that desk audits had been completed for 9 of the subrecipients
files tested.

0 of the subrecipient contracts did not contain the CFDA number.

0 ll subrecipients? ?les had no documentation as to whether or not an A-133 audit was
required. Also, we noted no evidence of receipt of the A-l33 reports. As a result, we
were unable to determine if JAC reviewed these reports, and if applicable, issued a
management decision on audit ?ndings in accordance with OMB Circular A-133 Subpart
Section .405(a).

0 We were unable to determine the total amount provided to subrecipients for six (6) of the
subrecipients tested.

0 For four (4) ?les tested the amounts provided to the subrecipients exceeded the budgeted
amount. There was no documentation of explanations provided for these increases.

EFFECT

Failure to adequately monitor the activities and performance of subrecipients could result in
Federal awards being used for unauthorized purposes and inability to adequately perform
risk assessments on subrecipients.



Per discussion with management, this occurred due to management?s unfamiliarity with Federal
regulations pertaining to subrecipient monitoring.

RECOMMENDATION

We recommend I AC develop and implement written policies and procedures for monitoring its
subrecipients that at a minimum ensures: 1) desk audits are performed timely and appropriately
documented, 2) site visits are routinely performed for each subrecipient, 3) all required
subrecipient reports are received and reviewed timely, 4) documentation is maintained on reviews
of subrecipients A?l33 audits, and where applicable, issue timely management decisions on audit

CRITERIA

In accordance with the requirements of the Davis-Bacon Act and the DOL regulations (29 CFR
Part 5, ?Labor Standards Provisions Applicable to Contracts Governing Federally Financed and
Assisted Construction?), non-federal entities shall include in their construction contracts a
requirement that the contractor or subcontractor comply with the Davis-Bacon Act.

This includes a requirement for the contractor or subcontractor to submit to the non-federal entity
weekly, for each week in which any contract work is performed, a certified copy of the payroll
and a statement of compliance (29 CFR sections 5.5 and 5.6).

OMB Circular A-133 Subpart Section .300(b) requires auditees to maintain internal control
over Federal programs that provide reasonable assurance that the auditee is managing Federal
awards in compliance with laws, regulations, and the provisions of the contracts or grant
agreements that could have a material effect on each of its Federal programs.

CONDITION

During the current audit period, the Department of Environmental Control did not adequately
document its compliance with Federal Davis-Bacon requirements for the EECBG program.

CONTEXT

During our review of the Department of Environmental Control?s Manual of Administrative
Procedures, we noted references to a website that provides an overview of the Davis Bacon
requirements and other links providing information about Davis Bacon compliance. However,
these procedures do not provide required policies and procedures in a detailed manner that
ensures that controls are in place over compliance with the requirements of the Davis Bacon Act.

this form only validates the receipt of the certi?ed payrolls to the department?s portal. Without
adequate written policies and procedures, we could not substantiate the review of the certi?ed
payrolls during our testing of nine (9) construction ?les.

EFFECT

Failure to document the review of certi?ed payrolls submitted by contractors is a violation of
Federal regulations and impairs the Department of Environmental Control?s ability to adequately
monitor the Federally funded program. The lack of written policies and procedures is a signi?cant
de?ciency and impairs the Department of Environmental Control?s ability to consistently comply
with Davis Bacon requirements.

CAUSE

Based on discussions with management, this situation is the result of administrative oversight.
RECOMMENDATIONS

We recommend the Department of Environmental Control establish and implement written
policies and procedures to ensure its compliance with the Davis Bacon Act requirements and
ensure that documentation of procedures performed are appropriately maintained. These policies
and procedures should detail each process as well as the party (ies) responsible for the process.

CRITERIA

The Of?ce of Management and Budget A-133 Compliance Supplement (June 2012) states that
there are eligibility requirements for subrecipients, but not for recipients.

42 USC 17154 states that an eligible entity may use a grant received under this part to carry out
activities to achieve the purposes of the program, including (5) the provision of grants to
nonprofit organizations and governmental agencies for the purpose of performing energy
ef?ciency retro?ts.

For the purposes of the EECBG Program, ?city? includes a city-equivalent unit of local
government as defined by the U.S. Census of Governments. For example, a city-equivalent unit
of local government such as town, village, or other municipality shall be considered eligible if it
meets the required population thresholds. Consolidated city-county governments will be
considered as cities.

Cities that are eligible for direct formula grants from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) are
those that have a population of at least 35,000, or that are one of the 10 highest populated cities of
the state in which the city is located. In states that have incorporated eligible municipalities
(villages) within the boundaries of other incorporated eligible municipalities (towns), the village
population will be subtracted from the town?s population (42 USC Section 17151).

Nongovernmental organizations are eligible to receive subgrants for the purpose of assisting in
the implementation of the energy ef?ciency and conservation strategy of the eligible unit of local
government or Indian tribe (42 USC 17154(a) (5).

OMB Circular A-l33 Subpart Section .300(b) requires auditees to maintain internal control
over Federal programs that provide reasonable assurance that the auditee is managing Federal
awards in compliance with laws, regulations, and the provisions of the contracts or grant
agreements that could have a material effect on each of its Federal programs.

CONDITION

During the current audit period, the Department of Environmental Control did not comply with
Federal eligibility requirements.

CONTEXT

During our review of thirteen (l3) subrecipients? eligibility ?les, no supporting documentation
was maintained to determine compliance with the eligibility requirements for local governments
and non-govemmenta] units. We noted that the ?les tested were for projects started in prior years.
However, the Department of Environmental Control did not maintain written polices and
procedures to document the Department?s ability to adequately determine compliance with
eligibility requirements.

CONDITION

During the current audit period, the Department of Environmental Control did not comply with
Federal reporting requirements.

CONTEXT

During our testing of six (6) reports (two (2) Section 1512 ARRA reports, 2 quarterly reports, and
2 reports), we noted the following:

1. Reportedly, both SF-425 reports were prepared on an accrual basis. However, the
amounts reported were on a cash basis. A reconciliation to the Transaction Analysis
(accrual basis) noted the following:

0 Total cumulative expenditures for the period ended 12/31/201 1 per the report
were $7,435,613. However, total expenditures per the Transaction Analysis provided
were $7,423,930, a difference of $11,683.

0 Total cumulative expenditures for the period ended 3/31/2012 per the SF-425 report
were $8,241,768. However, total expenditures per the Transaction Analysis provided
were $8,686,386, a difference of $444,618.

2. We noted no evidence of supervisory review of the six reports tested, nor was there
documentary evidence of written policies and procedures for the supervisory review of
reports.

EFFECT

Failure to maintain adequate documentation resulted in inaccurate reporting, re?ecting an overage
of $432,935 in expenditures and is a violation of Federal requirements.

CAUSE

Per discussion with management, this occurred due to the lack of adequate review of required
reports.

RECOMMENDATION

We recommend the Department of Environmental Control develop and implement procedures to
ensure compliance with Federal reporting requirements that includes, at a minimum, adequate
supervisory review of reports, reporting based on the selected accounting basis, and maintenance
of adequate supporting documentation.

CRITERIA

States, and governmental subrecipients of States, shall use the same State policies and procedures
used for procurements from non-federal funds. They also shall ensure that every purchase order
or other contract includes any clauses required by Federal statutes and executive orders and their
implementing regulations.

Local governments and Indian tribal governments which are not subrecipients of States will use
their own procurement procedures provided that they conform to applicable Federal law and
regulations and standards identi?ed in the OMB Circular A-102 Common Rule.

All non-federal entities shall follow Federal laws and implementing regulations applicable to
procurements, as noted in Federal agency implementation of the A-102 Common Rule and OMB
Circular A-110.

In addition to those statutes listed in the A-102 Common Rule and OMB Circular A-110, Section
1605 of ARRA prohibits the use of ARRA funds for a project for the construction, alteration,
maintenance, or repairs of a public building or work unless all of the iron, steel, and
manufactured goods used in the project are produced in the United States. This result in making
the Buy-American Act applies to these ARRA awards. ARRA provides for waiver of these
requirements under speci?ed circumstances.

An award term is required in all ARRA-funded awards for construction, alteration, maintenance,
or repair of a public building or public work (2 CFR Section 176.140). Further information about
this requirement, including applicable de?nitions, is found in 2 CFR Section 176.2.

The requirements for procurement are contained in the A-102 Common Rule OMB
Circular A-110 (2 CFR Sections 215.40 through 215.48), program legislation; Section 1605 of
ARRA, 2 CFR part 176 Federal awarding agency regulations, and the terms and conditions of the
award (including those required by ARRA).

Suspension and Debarment

Govemmentwide requirements for nonprocurement suspension and debarment are contained in
the OMB guidance in 2 CFR Part 180, which implements Executive Orders 12549 and 12689,
Debarment and Suspension. The OMB guidance, which superseded the suspension and
debarment common rule published November 26, 2003, is substantially the same as that rule.

Non-federal entities are prohibited from contracting with or making subawards under covered
transactions to parties that are suspended or debarred or whose principals are suspended or
debarred. ?Covered transactions? include those procurement contracts for goods and services
awarded under a nonprocurement transaction grant or cooperative agreement) that are
expected to equal or exceed $25,000 or meet certain other speci?ed criteria. 2 CFR Section
180.220 of the govemmentwide nonprocurement debarment and suspension guidance contains
those additional limited circumstances. All nonprocurement transactions subawards to
subrecipients), irrespective of award amount, are considered covered transactions.

When a non?federal entity enters into a covered transaction with an entity at a lower tier, the non?
federal entity must verify that the entity is not suspended or debarred or otherwise excluded. This
verification may be accomplished by checking the Excluded Parties List System (EPLS)
maintained by the General Services Administration (GSA), collecting a certi?cation from the
entity, or adding a clause or condition to the covered transaction with that entity (2 CFR Section
180.300).

Cook County Code Part I, Chapter 34, Article IV, Division 4, Sec. 34-172 and states: 
Person shall be ineligible to enter into a Contract with the County if such Person or a
Substantial Owner (as de?ned in Article V, Section 34-367) is delinquent in the payment of a
Court-Ordered Child Support Arrearage. If the County becomes aware that a Person or
Substantial Owner becomes delinquent in payments under a Court-Ordered Child Support
Arrearage after the County has entered into a Contract with such Person or Substantial Owner,
then after notice from the County of such noncompliance and a 30?day opportunity to pay such
delinquency, such delinquency of such Person or Substantial Owner shall be an event of default
under the Contract. Such Person or Substantial Owner shall provide suf?cient evidence to the
CPO of payment of such delinquency.?

Cook County Code Part 1, Chapter 34, Article IV, Division 8, Subdivision 1, General Provisions
states: ?The County has adopted a Minority Business Enterprise Ordinance to ensure that
minority and women's businesses are provided full and equal opportunity to participate in
Contracts. This subdivision shall be known and may be cited as the Cook County Minority- and
Women-Owned Business Enterprise General Ordinance. This subdivision is applicable to all
Contracts, except Public Works Contracts. These provisions include the following:

Sec. 34-267. - Program goals. The County aspires to the following annual Program Goals:
A goal of 25 percent of the annual total dollar amount of Contracts other than Public Works
Contracts to MBEs, and ten percent of the total dollar amount of such Contracts to WBEs. 
The CCD, in consultation with the CPO and the Using Agency shall establish Contract
Speci?c Goals for each Contract. In establishing a Contract Speci?c Goal, the CCD shall
consider the availability of sufficient Certi?ed MBEs and WBEs for the supplies, materials
and equipment or services required as part of the Procurement. No goal shall be treated as
a quota nor shall it be used to discriminate against any Person on the basis of race, color,
national origin, religion or sex.

CONDITION

During the current audit period, the Of?ce of the Chief Procurement Of?cer (OCPO) did not 1)
adequately ensure Federally-funded contracts issued to vendors were in compliance with Federal
regulations, and 2) maintain documentation to ensure compliance with the Cook County Code of
Ordinances which requires veri?cation of whether potential contractors are delinquent in taxes
and fees, including child support payments, prior to the awarding of the contract, and compliance
with BE requirements.

Finding 2012 - 18 (Continued)

 

CONTEXT

During our current period test of seventeen (17) Federally?funded contracts, we noted the
following:

0 One (1) contract file could not be provided for our review.

0 Two (2) contract ?les did not contain evidence of the monitoring of vendors against the
Federal EPLS.

0 OCPO did not monitor Federally-funded contracts to determine if procurements were
funded under and in compliance with the Recovery Act. OCPO did not obtain copies of
grant agreements from user departments to perform monitoring with grant agreement
provisions.

0 For two (2) contracts, we noted no documentation to verify if potential contractors were
delinquent in child support payments, or whether the required veri?cations of delinquent
taxes and fees were performed.

0 For two (2) contracts, we noted no evidence of compliance with BE requirements
and/or waivers of such requirements.

EFFECT

Failure to review all Federally-funded contracts for applicable Federal requirements could result
in noncompliance with Federal regulations. The failure to determine if Federally-funded contracts
include Recovery Act funding could result in Recovery Act funded contracts violating Federal
requirements.

Per Federal regulations, if a participant knowingly does business with an excluded person, the
Federal agency responsible for the transaction could disallow costs, annul or terminate the
transaction, issue a stop work order, debar or suspend the participant, or take other remedies as
deemed appropriate.

Failure to comply with the provisions of the Cook County Code could result in ineligible
participation in the County?s procurement process. Also, the failure of the OCPO to maintain
adequate documentation of the monitoring of potential delinquencies in taxes and fees, including
child support, impairs the efficiency of the contract award/evaluation process, and could result in
unquali?ed vendors/contractors being awarded Federally funded contracts.

EFFECT

Failure to include the required contract provisions is a violation of Federal regulations and could
result in non-compliance with Federal regulations by contractors, subcontractors, and vendors of
Federally-funded contracts.

Per Federal regulations, if a participant knowingly does business with an excluded person, the
Federal agency responsible for the transaction could disallow costs, annul or terminate the
transaction, issue a stop work order, debar or suspend the participant, or take other remedies as
deemed appropriate.

Failure to comply with the provisions of the Cook County Code could result in contract
termination. Also, the failure of to maintain adequate documentation of the monitoring
of potential delinquencies in taxes and fees impairs the ef?ciency of the contract
award/evaluation process, and could result in unquali?ed vendors/contractors being awarded

CAUSE

Based on discussions with management, this occurred due to staff turnover, as well as the lack of
understanding of Federal regulations over the procurement process.

Section .320 Report Submission, General, requires the data collection form and reporting
package ?shall be submitted within the earlier of 30 days after the receipt of the auditor?s
report(s), or nine months after the end of the audit period, unless a longer period is agreed to in
advance by the cognizant or oversight agency for audit.? On March 22, 2011, OMB issued M-10-
14, MEMORANDUM FOR THE HEADS OF EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS AND
AGENCIES, which states the following:

?Due to the importance of the Single Audits and the reliance of Federal agencies on the audit
results to monitor the accountability of Recovery Act programs, agencies should not grant any
extension request to grantees for fiscal years 2010 through 2011. In order to meet the criteria for a
low-risk auditee (OMB Circular A-133 in the current year, the prior two years audits
must have met the requirements of OMB Circular A-133, including report submission to the FAC
by the due date (OMB Circular A-133 

CONDITION

The County failed to comply with the requirements of OMB Circular A-133 Subpart C, Section
320 

CONTEXT

The County?s data collection forms and the reporting packages (includes the single audit report
and the basic financial statements) are due no later than August 31St of each year. During our
review of the submissions of the prior two ?scal years? data collection forms and reporting
packages, we noted the reporting package for ?scal year 2010 was dated September 6, 2011. The
data collection form and the reporting package were submitted to the Federal Audit
Clearinghouse until September 22, 2011. As a result of M-10-14, no extension was allowed for
?scal year 2010. The ?nal due date for the submission of the 2010 data collection form and the
reporting package was August 31, 2011.

EFFECT

As a result of not submitting the data collection form and the reporting package in a timely
manner, the County did not comply with OMB Circular A-133. Also, as a result of this non-
compliance, the County cannot be considered a low-risk auditee for ?scal year 2012.

CAUSE

Per discussions with management, the untimely submission of the data collection form and the
reporting package in ?scal year 2010 was the direct result of delays experienced in the

OMB Circular A-133, Subpart C-Auditees, Section 300 Auditee responsibilities states that
?the auditee shall identify, in its accounts, all Federal awards received and expended and the
Federal programs under which they were received.?

CONDITION

The County failed to maintain adequate controls over the reporting of expenditures of Federal
awards.

CONTEXT

During the current year, the County presented a preliminary Schedule of Expenditures of Federal
Awards (SEFA) for audit. Subsequently, it was determined that various older grants, not yet
closed out, contained balances either in excess of, or less than, revenues received. This resulted in
a signi?cant revision in amounts reported in the current period?s SEFA to close out these older
grants.

Additionally, we noted there are no policies and procedures to consistently ensure the proper
close-out of Federally funded grants.

EFFECT
Failure to consistently close out Federally funded grants could result in the over or

understatement of Federal expenditures in the SEFA. The net effect of the current year analysis of
these grants was the overstatement of prior years? by approximately $3.2 million.

Corrective Action Plan for FY2012 Single Audit Finding 2012-2

This is the JTDC's response to the FY2012 single audit findings outlined below:

Special Tests and Provisions, Commodities
Federal Department U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)
Passed-through the Illinois State Board of Education (ISBE)
Child Nutrition Cluster:
0 School Breakfast Program, CFDA 10.553
0 National School Lunch Program (NSLP), CFDA 10.555
County Department - Juvenile Temporary Detention Center (JTDC)
Finding 2012 - 2 Questioned Costs: None

 

Description of Deficiencies:

Failure to perform a physical inventory and reconcile the physical inventory to
the inventory records is a violation of Federal regulations and could result in the
misstatement of perpetual records and the improper distribution or loss of
purchased and/or donated commodities.

Background:

Based on our review, we were unable to obtain evidence that a physical
inventory of commodities was completed during the current year. As a result, we
could not determine if the physical inventory was reconciled with 
inventory Report.

Page 105 of 128

JTDC CORRECTIVE ACTIQN PLAN:

1. The Food Service department will ensure that the commodity inventory
report is completed every month.

2. The report will be reviewed and signed by the staff member assigned to
manage the inventory.

3. The signed document will be submitted each month to the Director of Food Services
or one of the Food Service Supervisors for review pertaining to accuracy of content.

4. Each month, the Director of Food Services will submit a copy of the report to the
Director of Business and Finance.

5. At the end of the year, the Director of Food Services and/or the Food Services
Supervisors will complete a physical inventory, review, audit, and document any
discrepancies. Corrective action will be implemented if necessary and a member of
the Food Services Management team will sign the final product. A copy of the report
will be submitted to the Director of Business and Finance.

Assigned to: Vanessa Mason - Director of Food Services

Implementation Date of Correction Action Plan: May 14, 2013.

for Program Year 2013 and beyond, both numbers will be included in the subrecipient
contracts. Related to on?site monitoring, management will ensure that staff completes
monitoring visits for every project and that standard documentation ofthe visit and its

FINDING 2012-6
Views of Responsible Officials and Corrective Action Plans:

The municipal performance meeting requirement was removed in November, 2012, so
evidence of such performance meetings will no longer be required. Similarly, there is
no longer a need for a tracking or monitoring system since the municipal performance
meeting requirement has been removed. The Department put its revised Citizen
Participation Plan making both of these changes out for public comment from October
8, 2012 to November 8, 2012. The revised Citizen Participation Plan was approved by
the Community Development Advisory Council (CDAC) on November 8, 2012, and the
Department transmitted the revised Plan to HUD on December 26, 2012. The
Department provided citizens with the chance to review and comment on its
Consolidated Annual Performance and Evaluation Report (CAPER) by posting a notice to
its website and publishing in the Chicago Tribune on October 5, 2012, advising the
public that the 15-day comment period would run from October 24 through November
8, 2012, the requisite 15-day period required by HUD. This procedure for public review
of and comment on the CAPER is documented in the revised Citizen Participation Plan
and will be added to the CDBG Program standard procedures and operations guide.

Views of Responsible Officials and Corrective Action Plans:

The Homelessness Prevention and Rapid Re-Housing Program (HPRP) ended nationwide
on September 30, 2012. Cook County?s HPRP program was officially closed out with the
US. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) on April 17, 2013.

The Emergency Solutions Grants Program (ESG), formerly the Emergency Shelter Grants
Program, contains some elements of the HPRP program and has similar eligibility
requirements. Staff is currently revising its ESG policies and procedures and keeping
subrecipients informed of ESG eligibility requirements; these efforts will help prevent
issues like those identified in this HPRP finding. Staff will ensure that subrecipients
perform all required eligibility determinations and maintain documentation of same in
program participant files. The Department has learned several lessons from
administering HPRP, and has an additional staff person to ensure that subrecipient
monitoring is performed on a timely basis and that subrecipients are compliant and

FROM: Ray Balcarcel, CFO ?gr

Of?ce of the State?s Attorney
RE: 2012 Single Audit
You have asked me to prepare our management response to the draft ?ndings presented to

us at the exit interview last week. Please accept the following:

2012-11

 

Cause: This appears to be an oversight on the part of our ?scal of?cers.

Corrective action: We have created a database of all grant agreements, including relevant
end dates and reporting deadlines, which will be updated whenever a new or renewal
program is established. The CFO and the Director of Programs and Development will
actively monitor these dates to ensure compliance.

2012-12

 

Cause: Because these contracts were executed by, and purchase orders issued by the
Of?ce of Procurement, we incorrectly treated these entities as vendors, rather than sub-
recipients.

Corrective action:

(1) Within the next 90 days we will evaluate all current grant agreements to determine
which, if any, include sub-recipients.

(2) Any subsequent new or renewal grants will be similarly evaluated at the time of
award.

(3) Any entity deemed to be a sub-recipient will be advised by the CFO, in writing, of
the requirements imposed on them by federal laws and regulations.

(4) In the event that an annual audit is required, the CFO will secure a copy of the
latest such audit, and will issue a management decision on any relevant audit
?ndings within six months.

(5) The Programs and Development Unit will schedule periodic reviews and/or site
visits to monitor performance and will report back to the sub-recipient on the
results of such reviews within 60 days. .

Re: 2012 Single Audit Corrective Action Plan

 

Finding 2012-17
Corrective Action Plan:

Procedural changes are being implemented to ensure compliance with Federal reporting
requirements thereby eliminating timing discrepancies in the reporting of grant expenditures
and providing supervisory review and approval of all reports. These changes will be
incorporated in the Standard Operating Procedures byJune 28, 2013.

The reporting inaccuracies noted in this finding were the result of the timing of the
Department of Environmental Control?s draws from the Federal Government. The
Department determined the amount of the draw a week prior to the end of the
month. Thus, expenses booked during the last week of the month were being captured
in the Federal drawdown in the following month. This practice resulted in a difference
between the expenses shown on the Federal reports and the month-end Transaction
Analysis Report. Although all expenditures are being captured, they were not all being
reported in the appropriate reporting time period. Effective immediately, the
Department Accountant will determine the amount of the draw shortly after month-
end. This information will be passed on to the Department Deputy Director requesting
the Federal drawdown and the contracted project management firm preparing the
Federal reports. Modifying the timing of the Federal draws will eliminate the
lag in reporting of grant expenditures on the Federal reports.

0 The report preparer will be required to submit all Federal reports to the Department
one week prior to the submission deadlines for supervisory review and approval. The
Accountant will verify the amounts shown on the Federal reports utilizing all available

SUBJECT: Corrective Action Plan

You have asked that the Office of the Chief Procurement Officer provide its Corrective Action
Plan to the 2012 Single Audit Action, 2012-18 Finding. Based upon my review of Finding 2012-13 the
following changes and enforcement of existing procedures are being implemented to address the audit
findings:

1. Excluded Parties List System The OCPO has previously implemented a procedure to
ensure that OCPO staff analyzes the EPLS to determine that a vendor has not been debarred or
suspended from receiving a federally funded contract. Specifically, the OCPO will reinforce existing
procedures to ensure that OCPO staff includes documentation in the file verifying that the vendor
is not on the EPLS.

2. American Recovery Reinvestment Act Funds. The OCPO is not aware of any contracts
awarded with ARRA Funds, which did not include the necessary ARRA provisions. Additionally,
effective November 1, 2011, the OCPO implemented procedures to ensure that federal clauses
were added to the standard general conditions for federally-funded projects. The OCPO will
implement procedures to ensure that OCPO staff requests grant agreements to determine
whether ARRA applies.

3. Cook County Code. The OCPO has previously implemented procedures to ensure that vendors,
who are awarded contracts are not delinquent in taxes, fees and child support payments. The
OCPO has implemented a procedure requesting that when Using Agencies request amendments to
contracts with vendors, vendors must complete a new Economic Disclosure Statements, so that
the OCPO can determine if the vendor is delinquent in taxes, fees and child support payments.

4. Requirements. The OCPO has previously implemented a procedure to ensure that the
Contract Compliance Administrator reviews participation by minority and women owned business
enterprises. The OCPO will reinforce existing procedures to ensure that OCPO staff includes
documentation in the file verifying that the Contract Compliance Administrator reviews 
requirements.

Re: Federal Audit Response

Cook County Health and Hospitals System's Supply Chain has reviewed all policies and procedures
related to all contract and procurement processes which include those speci?c to federally funded
grants. We have worked and developed with the Health System legal counsel to modify such
policies and procedures that are affected as related to the inclusion of all required language,
including that which is speci?c for federally funded grants. Further, we have developed Federal
Conditions to be included with all applicable contracts. We will also re-train all applicable staff
members for the checking of vendors from all applicable databases that contain notice of any type of
disbarment (taxes and fees in particular), so that we do not enter into a contract with them
inappropriately.

As the Supply Chain moves forward with the implementation of our new technology, we
will have a better handle on the types of contracts that each contract and procurement is related to.
This will assist us in documenting and tracking federal grant requirements on a regular basis. In
addition, we will go back and amend all contracts that were multi-year agreements to add all required
language.

If you have any further questions or concerns please do not hesitate to contact me.
