IN SUPPORT OF “WE DON’T SERVE TEENS,” AN INITIATIVE
BY THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION, CONSTELLATION BRANDS BEER DIVISION,
AND COOK COUNTY BEER DISTRIBUTORS AND RETAILERS TO ENLIST PARENTS
AND OTHER ADULTS TO FIGHT UNDERAGE DRINKING
WHEREAS, Cook County is home to many of the top middle schools, high schools, colleges and
universities in the United States, and during September thousands of students are beginning the fall semester
with enthusiasm and great hope to advance in their studies; and
WHEREAS, for several years, Cook County has recognized the Federal Trade Commission’s “We Don’t
Serve Teens” consumer education campaign as a valuable resource to raise awareness among parents,
educators, and other adults that furnishing alcohol to minors is illegal and that common-sense measures can
further reduce illegal underage drinking and the dangers caused by underage drinking to teens themselves
and to the general public; and
WHEREAS, the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)
indicates that progress has continued for more than a decade in reducing underage drinking, but it remains
a serious public health problem for adolescents and young adults; and
WHEREAS, underage drinking is illegal and persons under the age of 21 are subject to arrest, fines and
criminal records for possession of alcohol beverages or driving after consumption of a single drink; and
WHEREAS, a substantial proportion of college students are under the age of 21 and face significantly
higher risks than their non-college peers of injury or death from assault, car crashes, and other accidents
after illegally consuming alcohol; and
WHEREAS, federally-funded surveys find that significant numbers of younger persons between the ages
of 12 and 14 drank alcohol in the month before they were surveyed, and that more than 90 percent obtain
alcohol from their own home, the home of a friend, or an adult family member. Those findings clearly
indicate the importance that family members can play in reducing young adolescents’ access to alcohol and
the associated risks of injury and the early onset of serious health problems; and
WHEREAS, the consequences of illegal underage drinking are often tragic, and all of these hazards are
preventable with a sincere commitment of parents, guardians, and concerned citizens to remain involved in
the lives of their younger family members, friends and neighbors; and
WHEREAS, We Don’t Serve Teens provides concerned adults and teens with useful information on the
dangers of underage drinking, the manner in which most teens procure alcohol, the costs of violating the
law and strategies to overcome peer pressure and other negative influences; and
WHEREAS, We Don’t Serve Teens information is available at a web site established by the Federal Trade
Commission, www.dontserveteens.gov, and the information will be publicized by Cook Country-based

to teens; it’s unsafe, illegal and irresponsible; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that Cook County calls upon all licensed alcohol beverage retailers to
actively participate in We Don’t Serve Teens outreach efforts to their customers; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, Cook County commends Constellation Brands Beer Division, Cook
County beer distributors, and Cook County alcohol beverage retailers for their many years of sustained
support for We Don’t Serve Teens; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, the Cook County calls upon all parents, civic leaders and other adults
involved in the lives of teens to post the We Don’t Serve Teens logo on their social network pages and to
utilize the information available from this initiative to increase awareness of the measures they can take to
further reduce underage drinking in Cook County.

COMMEMORATING THE EXTRAORDINARY LIFE OF JUDITH ANN PIER
WHEREAS, Judith Ann Pier lived a rich and fulfilled life. She was an exceptional woman who left behind
a devoted family, countless friends and a community profoundly enriched for having known her; and
WHEREAS, Judith Ann Pier was a lifelong Chicagoan, born on May 20, 1944. She excelled early in
school, graduated with honors from high school and summa cum laude from college. She spent her early
years teaching in the Chicago Public Schools, where she made a lasting impact on the students, many with
whom she remained in contact throughout her life; and
WHEREAS, Judy met the love of her life, Wayne, when he was coaching her softball team over four (4)
decades ago and married him on July 4, 1975. The two (2) began a journey abundant with deep love, mutual
respect and a sense of adventure. The couple shared many incredible travels around the world and gathered
friends wherever they went; and
WHEREAS, Judith Ann Pier was an absolute natural when it came to sales and was often singled out for
recognition. She was voted sales person of the year by Tab Products in 1978; and was selected sales person
of the year by Bradford Systems in 1983. She brought those talents along with her when she and her husband
opened a small business; the two (2) successfully ran Windy City Records Management Services until 2016;
and
WHEREAS, Judith Ann Pier was a major force for good in the community. She was active in many civic
organizations was a fixture and regular volunteer at Alderman Harry Osterman’s office. She was a devoted
Catholic and treasured member of the Committee for Community Life, where she organized countless
events such as picnics, trips to visit people in nursing homes in addition to many other activities. She took
great pride in hosting and introducing the city of Chicago to numerous visitors and foreign-exchange

She never refused a request, whether it was from her church, her family, her neighborhood or her friends;

WHEREAS, Judith Ann Pier was uniformly regarded as a force of nature. She was at once a fierce
competitor and a remarkably gracious winner, and she was an accomplished woman with a variety of
talents. She remained a competitor to the end, despite her growing illness. Her competitive spirit was
eclipsed by her humility and self-deprecating sense of humor. While undergoing chemotherapy, she
organized a pool for her friends to place bets on when she was going to lose her hair; and
WHEREAS, the community has lost a great friend in Judith Ann Pier and she will be sorely missed. Her
loss will be felt most acutely by her husband of forty-one years, Wayne, her family and the countless people
who treasured her friendship. She will long be remembered for being a world-class best friend. She was
thoughtful and exuberant and will be particularly remembered for the lovely handwritten notes of thanks

PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT
AN AMENDMENT TO THE COOK COUNTY AMUSEMENT TAX
WHEREAS, it is the intent of the County Board to recognize and encourage both the artists who add to
our cultural identity as well as the venues that allow them to display their talents to crowds from around the
County and around the world by exempting them from the City and County’s amusement tax for live
performances; and
WHEREAS, it is not the role of government to restrictively decide and define what is and is not ‘music’;
and
WHEREAS, to single out one or any type of music genre performed at these types of venues as not
applicable to the small venue exemption clause is not in the spirit or purpose of the exemption clause nor
the expansive definition of music;
WHEREAS, as the recording industry and music genres have evolved, the National Academy of Recording
Arts and Sciences has recognized although sometimes more slowly than society at large, that new music
genres evolve and form, such as Rock, Rap, Reggae, Metal, Roots, Electronica, New Age etc.; and
WHEREAS, DJ’s have been considered an art form for many years now and in fact the National Academy
of Recording Arts and Sciences’ Grammy Awards created the Grammy Award for Remixer of the Year,
Non-Classical at the 40th Grammy Awards in 1998 to recognize an individual(s) who takes previously
recorded material and adds or alters it in such a way as to create a new and unique performance; and
WHEREAS, the first Grammy Award for such category was presented to Chicago’s very own Frankie
Knuckles whose key role in developing and popularizing House music into an internationally recognized
musical genre during the 1980s led to him being referred to as the "The Godfather of House Music."; and
WHEREAS, in 1998, the Cook County Board created an exemption to the Amusement Tax for small
venues with a maximum capacity of not more than 750 persons, and in 1999 the County Board further
amended said ordinance by defining live performances by examples giving several genre examples and art
forms including live musical performances, but does not restrict it to only those examples by including the
encompassing term “music”; and
WHEREAS, the current language contained in the County Code has created unintended and unnecessary
confusion as to what constitutes ‘music’ and has created undue burdens on venue operators who are being
required to comply with inconsistent definitions, restrictions and exemptions by the County and the City of
Chicago; and
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that Chapter
74 Taxation, Article X, Amusement Tax, Sections 74-391 and 74-392 of the Cook County Code of
Ordinances are hereby amended as follows:
Sec. 74-391. - Definitions.

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

September 14, 2016

The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them
in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Amusement means any exhibition, performance, presentation or show for entertainment
purposes, including, but not limited to, any theatrical, dramatic, musical or spectacular performance,

or transactions similar thereto under whatever name by which they may be indicated.
Charges paid means the gross amount of consideration paid for the privilege to enter, to

but not including charges that are added on account of the tax imposed by this article or on account of any
other tax imposed on the charge.
Department and Department of Revenue means the County Department of Revenue.
Live theatrical, live musical or other live cultural performance means a live performance in
any of the disciplines which are commonly regarded as part of the fine arts, such as live theater, music

14.2.1 of the Cook County Zoning Ordinance).
Maximum capacity means the persons that an auditorium, theater or other space may
accommodate as determined by the local fire department or other appropriate governmental agency;
provided, however, that maximum capacity shall not exceed the maximum number of tickets or admissions
that may be made available for sale to a performance as stated in any binding written agreement relating to
that performance. If the number of tickets or admissions actually sold to a performance exceeds the legally
permissible limit, then, for purposes of determining the applicable tax, the term "maximum capacity" shall
mean such greater number.

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

September 14, 2016

Societies or organizations conducted for the sole purpose of maintaining symphony
orchestras, opera performances or artistic presentations, including, but not limited to,
musical presentations ("artistic societies or organizations"), if the artistic society or
organization:
1.

Receives substantial support from voluntary contributions;

2.

Is a not-for-profit institution where no part of the net earnings inure to the
benefit of any private shareholder or person; and

3.

Either (i) bears all risk of financial loss from its presentation of the amusement,
where the amusement takes place at a venue that is owned or operated by a notfor-profit institution, no part of whose net earnings inure to the benefit of any
private shareholder or person, and where the amusement is limited to an
engagement of not more than four calendar days over the course of a calendar
year, or (ii) is substantially and materially involved in the production and
performance of the amusement. Where an amusement is sponsored or
conducted by two or more artistic societies or organizations, the requirements
of subsections (b)(3)g.1. and 2. of this section must be met by each of such
artistic societies or organizations, but the requirements of subsection (b)(3)g.3.
may be met by any of such artistic societies or organizations, individually or in
combination.

(c) None of the exemptions contained in subsection (b)(3) of this section shall be granted
unless a written application for exemption is filed with the Department at least 45 calendar days prior to the
amusement event or 15 calendar days prior to the date that admission tickets to the amusement are first
made available for sale, whichever is earlier. The application shall be on a form prescribed by the Director
of Revenue and shall contain all information necessary to permit the Department to determine whether the
exemption claimed by the applicant is applicable. If the department determines that by granting the
exemption the potential loss of tax revenue will be greater than $150,000.00 the application shall be
submitted to the Cook County Board of Commissioners for final approval. The County Board may deny
the exemption application if it finds that the exemption is not in the best economic interest of the County.
(d) The tax imposed in subsection (a) of this section shall not apply to or be imposed upon:
(1) The admission fees to witness in person, live theatrical, live musical or other live
cultural performances that take place in any auditorium, theater or other space in the
County, whose maximum capacity, including all balconies and other sections, is not
more than 750 persons.
a. For purposes of subsection (d)(1), the Department will assume that the activities of
the DJ qualify as a live cultural performance where both of the following conditions
exist:
1. The pre-recorded material used by the DJ was recorded by the DJ. This may be
original work composed by the DJ or the work of other artists that the DJ has mixed
or otherwise modified.
Page 66 of 378

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

September 14, 2016

2. The DJ is paid substantially above the rate that would be paid solely for the service
of playing the pre-recorded material of other artists. The Department will assume
that the payment of $2,000 or more for a single performance qualifies the event for
this provision.
b. Where the activities of a DJ do not qualify for the provision set forth in Subsection
(d)(1)a. 1. and 2. of this section, they may nevertheless qualify as a live cultural
performance if at least four of the five following factors apply:
1. The DJ is featured in advertisements for the venue.
2. The DJ is visible to patrons of the venue, who spend a substantial amount of time
observing the DJ’s performance.
3. The DJ is featured more prominently than other amusements or activities available
at the venue.
4. The patrons are charged substantially above the amount that would be paid for
entry into the venue in the absence of the DJ. For purposes of this provision, the
term “substantially above” means at least one and a half times the amount that
would be charged without the DJ.
5. The DJ is represented by a manager and/or agent.
(2) Initiation fees and membership dues paid to a health club, racquetball club, tennis club
or a similar club or organization, when such club or organization is organized and
operated on a membership basis and for the recreational purposes of its members and
its members' guests, shall be exempt from the tax imposed in subsection (a) of this
section. This exemption shall not be construed to apply to any fees paid or based upon
a per-event or a per-admission basis.
(3) Fees or other charges paid by a patron for the privilege of witnessing, viewing or
participating in an amusement, solely within the confines of such patron's home, shall
be exempt from the imposition of the tax imposed in subsection (a) of this section. For
purposes of this exemption, the term "home" means the permanent dwelling residence
of the patron. For patrons who live in condominium buildings, apartment buildings or
other multiple-unit structures, the individual dwelling unit the patron occupies shall be
considered the patron's home.
(e) For the purpose of determining the amount of the amusement tax due under this article,
admission fees or other charges shall be computed exclusive of:
(1) Any Federal, State or municipal taxes imposed upon the amusement patron.
(2) Any amounts subject to other Cook County taxes (with the exception of County
Retailers' Occupation Tax), provided such County taxes are separately listed on the
Page 67 of 378

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

ticket of admission and the corresponding Cook County tax has been paid on that
separately stated amount.
(3) Any separately stated optional charges for nonamusement services or for sales of
tangible personal property.
(f) It is unlawful for any person to produce, present or conduct any amusement without
collection of the tax, except as provided in this article.
(1) The rate of the tax imposed in subsection (a) of this section shall be one percent of the
admission fees or other charges to witness in person live theatrical, live musical or other
live cultural performances that take place in any auditorium, theater or other space in
the County whose maximum capacity, including all balconies and other sections, is
more than 750 persons and less than 5,000 persons.
(2) The rate of the tax imposed in subsection (a) of this section shall be 1.5 percent of the
admission fees or other charges to witness in person live theatrical, live musical or other
live cultural performances that take place in any auditorium, theater or other space in
the County whose maximum capacity, including all balconies and other sections, is
5,000 persons or more.
(g) It shall be presumed that all amusements are subject to tax under this article until the
contrary is established by books, records or other documentary evidence.
(h) It is unlawful for any person to produce, present, conduct, or resell tickets to, any
amusement without collection of the tax, except as provided in this article.
Effective date: This ordinance shall be in effect immediately upon adoption.

TO PASS LEGISLATION EXEMPTING TEAM USA MEMBERS
FROM FEDERAL TAXATION ON THEIR OLYMPIC WINNINGS
WHEREAS, Olympic winners receive $25,000 for a gold medal, $15,000 for a silver medal, and $10,000
for a bronze medal, and the gold and silver medals themselves are valued anywhere from $564 to $300; and
WHEREAS, the Internal Revenue Service considers those winnings fully taxable achievement awards; and
WHEREAS, there is a great disparity of income level among Olympic athletes; most do not receive
lucrative endorsement contracts, and some maintain amateur status and are college students who rely on
family support and scholarships; and
WHEREAS, Olympic athletes can pay an income tax of anywhere from 10% to 39.6% depending on their
income; those in the highest bracket can expect to pay tax of approximately $9,900 for one gold medal; and
WHEREAS, support for exempting Olympians from being taxed on medal earnings has crossed party lines,
is supported by President Obama, and is gaining momentum given the record-breaking 121 medals won by
athletes representing the United States in Brazil; and
WHEREAS, in July of 2016, the Senate passed the United States Appreciation for Olympians and
Paralympians Act, which would exempt Team USA members from federal taxation on their Olympic wins;
and
WHEREAS, House of Representative leaders have pledged to vote this September on a bill identical to the
one passed by the Senate that would retroactively apply to the 2016 games in Rio De Janeiro; and
WHEREAS, this legislation would have no impact on federal taxes on athletes’ sponsorship or
endorsement income.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners urge the
United States House of Representatives to pass the United States Appreciation for Olympians and
Paralympians Act; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a suitable copy of this Resolution be distributed to the United States
House of Representatives.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
URGING PUBLICLY FUNDED UNIVERSITIES IN ILLINOIS TO COMPLY WITH FREEDOM
OF INFORMATION REQUESTS REGARDING USE OF ANIMALS IN SCIENTIFIC
RESEARCH
WHEREAS, various taxpayer-funded research institutions across the nation, including the University of
Illinois (U of I), have refused to provide records requested under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)
from advocacy groups regarding animal care and justification for the experiments conducted; and
WHEREAS, many of these same institutions have been involved in costly litigation over animal
research practices and documents; and
WHEREAS, opening records would jeopardize neither research nor the privacy of employees as federal
FOIA and state public-disclosure laws contain protections for trade secrets and other forms of personal
and proprietary information; and
WHEREAS, a lawsuit filed by the Beagle Freedom Project (so named because beagles’ size and docile
nature make them the frequent subject to such research) states that research protocols show that the U of
I is testing cardiovascular toxicity, and that the university admitted to classifying its veterinary records as
research records so it doesn’t have to disclose them; and
WHEREAS, the Beagle Freedom Project has helped pass legislation in the states of Minnesota,
California, Connecticut, and Nevada that requires public labs to offer animals up for adoption after
experiments conclude, and animal records the project obtained from the Ohio State University helped
pass a law barring labs from obtaining animals from questionable sources; and
WHEREAS, the Animal Welfare Act has been the primary federal law covering laboratory animals in
the United States, but there is no provision in the law that restricts what can be done to an animal during
a study; it applies only to the type of care an animal receives before and after experimentation; and
WHEREAS, an increasing number of scientists have admitted that unlike experimenting on animals to
help humans, modern methods, such as in vitro testing, computer modeling, human-patient simulators,
and genomics, take advantage of technological developments to provide more accurate and humane
options for research; and
WHEREAS, so powerful and effective are these non-animal technologies that in 2008, the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the National Toxicology Program, and the National Institutes
of Health launched the ToxCast initiative to promote cutting-edge technology to replace the use of
animals in toxicity testing; and
WHEREAS, recent significant changes in the laboratory animal regulatory environment have prompted
new scientific protocols, which state that using animals in research is a privilege granted by society to the
research community with the expectation that such use will provide either significant new knowledge or
Page 70 of 378

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

September 14, 2016

lead to improvement in human and/or animal well-being, and that these principles direct the research
community to accept responsibility for the care and use of animals during all phases of the research
effort; and
WHEREAS, in June of 2016 President Obama signed the first federal bill that will modernize chemical
testing, reduce the use of animals, and require the EPA to fund and develop non-animal methods; and
WHEREAS, it is reasonable that taxpayers in Cook County and the State of Illinois want to know that
animals used in research are being treated humanely.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and Cook County Board of
Commissioners hereby urge Illinois state institutions that use public funds for scientific research on
animals to cooperate with FOIA requests to help ascertain the nature of such experimentation and to
justify the expenditure of public funds.

Summary: Under the current intergovernmental agreement (“IGA”) with the South Suburban Mayors

Summary: The Bureau of Technology respectfully requests Board approval of an intergovernmental

broadband maintenance, monitoring, and other related services.
As an owner and operator of public broadband infrastructure, the County requires expertise normally
developed for internal operations purposes by broadband providers. SSMMA possesses a sophisticated

broadband assets integral to the County Wide Area Network (“WAN”). SSMMA is therefore in a unique
position to provide the County with access to expertise and services that the County would otherwise
have to develop at great cost.
The proposed IGA provides access to such services on an as-needed basis and is coterminous with the
existing IRU IGA.

Waiver.
The Chief Procurement Officer concurs.
Summary: On 9/11/2013, the Cook County Board of Commissioners approved a three-year contract
with Aunt Martha’s Youth Service Center, Inc. to manage Juvenile Probation and Court Services
Department’s Evening Reporting Centers Program and Pre-Trial Services. These services are key
components of the Circuit Court’s Juvenile Detention Alternative Initiatives. This proposed amendment
exercises the first of the two (2) one-year renewal options available in contract #13-23-001 with Aunt
Martha’s Youth Service Center, Inc.
The Evening Reporting Centers Program combines community-based alternative detention sites with
electronic monitoring. Judges order selected, nonviolent minors, both male and female, who would
otherwise qualify for detention in the Cook County Juvenile Temporary Detention Center (JTDC) to one
of six Centers. The minors are ordered to the program for up to 21 days. The Centers provide minors with
highly structured and well supervised group activities during high risk periods. The program’s goal is to
reduce the likelihood of re-arrest and to allow minors to continue to attend school and remain at home.
Juveniles are supervised five days per week from 5:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. in five Chicago locations and one
suburban location, in the south suburbs. Staff members offer minors educational activities, recreational
programming and life development workshops. Also, Center staff teach social/life skills to reinforce
pro-social behaviors and provide tutoring support for school work. The Centers provide transportation for
the minors to and from the minor’s home. In calendar 2015, 1,068 minors were referred to the Centers.
In addition to the Evening Reporting Centers Program, the contract provides for pretrial services for youth,
ages 10-18, who have pending juvenile charges. Directed by judicial order, pretrial services are provided
seven days a week and include group therapy, home visitation, curfew, and school attendance monitoring,
and referrals to services in the community. Services are coordinated by four full-time case managers, who
conduct thorough assessments of the adolescent and family situations and develop responsive case plans.
On average approximately 50 juveniles participate in the program from 21 to 30 days. In calendar 2015,
342 minors were referred for pretrial services.

new construction or substantial rehabilitation to qualify for a Class 6b incentive. With respect
to abandoned property, the Class 6b application must be made to the Assessor prior to the
commencement of the reoccupation of the vacant and unused property.

d.

In the instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as
defined herein, the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may still determine
that special circumstances justify finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for
purpose of Class 6b, unless:

be included in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and consenting to the Class 6b
application. If the Ordinance or Resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the
County Board is required to validate such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned"
for purposes of Class 6b, and a County Resolution to that effect shall be obtained. The
applicant must obtain the municipal enabling Ordinance with the required finding of special
circumstances and present such municipal Ordinance to the Board of Commissioners of
Cook County prior to its determination as to whether it will validate such a finding that the
property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b and provide a County Resolution
to that effect. A certified copy of an Ordinance or Resolution finding that special
circumstances exist, as well as a certified copy of a County Ordinance or Resolution
validating such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b

Temporary Emergency Economic Recovery Modification (TEERM) Program: In the
instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as defined
herein, the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may still determine that
special circumstances justify finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purpose
of a Class 6b under the TEERM Program if there has been no purchase for value and the
buildings and other structures have been vacant and unused for at least 12 continuous
months. The finding of abandonment, along with the specification of the special
circumstances, shall be included in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and consenting
to the Class 6b application under the TEERM Program. If the Ordinance or Resolution is
that of a municipality, the approval of the County Board is required to validate such a finding
that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b, and a County Resolution
to that effect shall be obtained. The applicant must obtain the municipal enabling Ordinance
with the required finding of special circumstances and present such municipal Ordinance to
the Board of Commissioners of Cook County prior to its determination as to whether it will
validate such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b

the Assessor, but must be filed with the Assessor no later than the date an assessment appeal
is filed to request the class change to Class 6b. If the Resolution is not filed at the time of the
Class 6b application, the applicant shall instead file, at that time, a letter from the

regarding special circumstances has been requested.
Sustainable Emergency Relief (SER) Program: In the instance where real estate does not
meet the definition of abandoned property as defined herein, the municipality or the County
Board, as the case may be, may still determine that special circumstances justify finding that
the property is deemed "qualified" for purpose of Class 6b under the SER Program if:
1.

The industrial enterprise that occupies the premises has been at the same location for a
minimum of ten years prior to the date of application for the SER Program; and

2.

The industrial enterprise that occupies the premises submits evidence of hardship
supporting a determination that participation in the SER Program is necessary for the
industrial enterprise to continue operations at its current location and maintain its staff,
and that without such designation the industrial enterprise would not be economically
viable causing the property to be in imminent risk of becoming vacant and unused.

The finding that a property is qualified, along with the specification of the special
circumstances, and a determination that the applicant's participation in the SER Program is
necessary for the industrial enterprise to continue operations at its current location and
maintain its staff, and that without such designation the industrial enterprise would not be
economically viable causing the property to be in imminent risk of becoming vacant and
unused, shall be included in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and consenting to the
Class 6b application. If the Ordinance or Resolution is that of a municipality, the approval
of the County Board is required to validate such a finding that the property is deemed
"qualified" for purposes of Class 6b, and a County Resolution to that effect shall be obtained.
The applicant must obtain the municipal enabling Ordinance with the required finding of
special circumstances and present such municipal Ordinance to the Board of Commissioners
of Cook County prior to its determination as to whether it will validate such a finding that
the property is deemed "qualified" for purposes of Class 6b and provide a County Resolution
to that effect. A certified copy of an Ordinance or Resolution finding that special
circumstances exist, as well as a certified copy of a County Ordinance or Resolution
validating such a finding that the property is deemed "qualified" for purposes of Class 6b
need not be filed at the time of filing the Class 6b application with the Assessor, but must be
filed with the Assessor no later than the date an assessment appeal is filed to request the class
change to Class 6b. If the Resolution is not filed at the time of the Class 6b application, the
applicant shall instead file, at that time, a letter from the municipality or the County as the
case may be, confirming that a Resolution or Ordinance regarding special circumstances has
been requested.
Applications for the TEERM Program or SER Program under a Class 6b application must
be received by the Assessor's Office on or before November 30, 2018 to receive
consideration.
The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of annual reports by recipients of Class 6b
incentives granted pursuant to the SER Program as to the use of the property and the number
of persons employed at the Class 6b site. In such reports, recipients shall be required to
certify whether the industrial enterprise that occupied the premises at the time of the SER
application continues its operations at that location. In addition, recipients of Class 6b
incentives granted pursuant to the SER Program shall be required to report to the Assessor
within 30 days if the industrial enterprise that occupied the premises at the time of the SER
application ceases operations at that location. A copy of such reports will be forwarded by
the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the County Board for distribution to members of the
County Board from the affected districts. Failure to file such reports within the time
established by the Assessor's rules shall result in loss of the incentive for the period relating
to the non-filing. Additionally, if the industrial enterprise that occupied the premises at the
time of the SER application ceases operations at that location, then the Class 6b incentive
granted pursuant to the SER program shall terminate.
e.

This classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the date such new construction
(excluding demolition, if any) or such substantial rehabilitation was completed and initially
assessed, or in the case of abandoned property, from the date of substantial re-occupancy, or
in the case of incentives granted pursuant to the TEERM Program, from the date of the notice
of approval. In the case of incentives granted pursuant to the SER Program, this classification
Page 154 of 378

shall continue for a period of 12 years from the date of the notice of approval, or until the
industrial enterprise that occupied the premises at the time of the SER application ceases
operations at that location if that occurs sooner.
f.

Unless a Class 6b granted pursuant to the TEERM Program or the SER Program, this
incentive may be renewed during the last year a property is entitled to a ten percent
assessment level pursuant to Section 74-64(7), if the following requirements are met:
1.

The taxpayer notifies the Assessor's Office of intent to request renewal of the incentive
from the municipality or the County Board if the real estate is located in an
unincorporated area;

2.

The municipality in which the real estate is located or the County Board, if the real
estate is located in an unincorporated area, adopts a Resolution expressly stating that
the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, has determined that the
industrial use of the property is necessary and beneficial to the local economy, and
supports and consents to renewal of the Class 6b; provided, however, that if the real
estate is located within an Industrial Growth Zone, in lieu of a Resolution, may provide
from an authorized officer of the municipality or an authorized officer of the Cook
County Bureau of Economic Development if the real estate is located in an
unincorporated area, a certified letter stating that the municipality or the County Board,
as the case may be, supports and consents to the renewal of the Class 6b; and

3.

A copy of that Resolution or certified authorization letter (if applicable) and a
completed renewal application are filed with the Assessor's Office before the expiration
of the ten percent assessment level period.

g.

Class 6b incentives that are granted pursuant to the TEERM Program or SER Program are
not renewable. For all other Class 6b incentives, the number of renewal periods is not limited
as long as the property continues to apply and meet the requirements for Class 6b.

h.

A copy of the request for renewal of the incentive will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office
to the Secretary of the County Board for distribution to members of the County Board from
the affected districts.

i.

If no renewal is obtained, the incentive shall be phased out over the next two years, pursuant
to Section 74-64(7). After expiration of the last incentive period, the real estate shall revert
to the applicable classification under this Division.

j.

The Assessor may adopt rules consistent with this subsection necessary to ensure proper
review of all factors relevant to determine eligibility for the benefits provided under Class
6b.

k.

The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports by all Class
6b recipients as to the use of the property and the number of persons employed at the Class

result in loss of the incentive for the period relating to the non-filing.
(8) Class C. Real estate which is to be used for industrial or commercial purposes, including
abandoned property, as defined in Section 74-62, including the land upon which such property is
situated; or vacant land; where such real estate because of contamination has undergone
environmental testing and remediation and has received a "No Further Remediation Letter" from
the site remediation program.
a.

To be eligible for a Class C classification an applicant must have received a "No Further
Remediation Letter" confirming achievement of the remediation objectives based on the
industrial or commercial use.

b.

The owner of the property is rendered ineligible for the Class C classification by having
previously owned or operated the site, directly or indirectly, or having been a partner or being
associated through a family or business relationship with anyone who has owned or operated
the site, which ownership or operation caused the contamination which was remediated
pursuant to a site remediation, except for an employee who worked for an owner, as defined
herein, that operated the site. A present owner or employer who can successfully demonstrate
that the owner or employer was not responsible for the contamination may be eligible for
Class C classification.

c.

An applicant must obtain from the municipality in which the real estate is located or the
County Board if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, an Ordinance or
Resolution expressly stating that the municipality or County Board, as the case may be, has
determined that the incentive provided by Class C is necessary for development to occur on
that specific real estate and that the municipality or County Board, as the case may be,
supports and consents to the Class C application to the Assessor. A certified copy of the
Ordinance or Resolution must be filed at the time of application for the Class C classification.
A copy of that Ordinance or Resolution, whichever is submitted, will be forwarded by the
Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the Board for distribution to the members of the County
Board from the affected districts.

d.

To qualify for the Class C classification, an application for Class C classification must be
made within one year of the receipt of the "No Further Remediation Letter". Where an
application for Class C classification encompasses less than all of the contiguous property
owned by the applicant upon which remediation has been completed, the one-year limitation
will be waived for any subsequent separate application for Class C classification for the
remainder or for additional portions of the property, provided that such subsequent
application is made within seven years.

e.

Additionally, to qualify for the Class C classification, the estimated remediation costs,
including site investigation, testing, oversight, remediation and removal costs, monitoring,
and engineering and legal fees associated with the remediation process, must total at least
$100,000.00, or alternatively, must total at least 25 percent of the market value of the real
estate as determined by the Assessor's property record card in the year prior to the
remediation, whichever is less.

The initial Class C classification shall continue for a period of 12 years for both industrial
and commercial property. For industrial property, this incentive may be renewed during the
last year a property is entitled to a 16-percent assessment level, if the following requirements
are met:
1.

The taxpayer notifies the Assessor's Office of the taxpayer's intent to request renewal
of the incentive from the municipality, or the County Board if the real estate is located
in an unincorporated area;

2.

The municipality in which the real estate is located or the County Board, if the real
estate is located in an unincorporated area, adopts a Resolution expressly stating that
the municipality or County Board, as the case may be, has determined that the industrial
use of the property is necessary and beneficial to the local economy, and supports and
consents to renewal of the Class C; and

3.

A copy of that Resolution and a completed renewal application are filed with the Office
of the Assessor before the expiration of the 16-percent assessment level period.

The number of renewal periods is not limited as long as the property continues to apply and
qualify for Class C. Any property which applies for Class C treatment on or before the
adoption date of the ordinance from which this division is derived will be eligible for this
renewal term at the end of their original incentive period subject to the above requirements.
The notice of intent to request renewal which is filed with the Assessor's Office will be
forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the Board for distribution to members
of the County Board from the effected districts.
g.

If, on November 23, 1999, a property is receiving Class C treatment, but the assessment level
is higher than 16 percent, that taxpayer may apply for renewal as outlined above and receive
a 16-percent assessment level for the prescribed period beginning after the filing and
approval of the resolution and renewal application. However, if, as of that effective date, the
taxpayer's assessment is higher than 16 percent and the taxpayer is granted a renewal of the
incentive for subsequent years, no reduction of the current assessment level based on renewal
of the incentive will be granted. If no renewal is obtained, the incentive shall be phased out
over the next two years, pursuant to Section 74-64. After such ten-year period expiration of
the last incentive period, the real estate shall revert to the applicable classification under this
Division.

h.

For commercial properties, once the original 12-year incentive period has expired, the
commercial Class C incentive will expire. The incentive classification will not be subject to
renewal and the real estate shall revert to the applicable classification under this Division.

i.

The Assessor shall review the application and supporting documentation to determine
eligibility for the Class C classification. The Assessor may adopt rules consistent with the
foregoing necessary to ensure proper review of all factors relevant to determine initial and
continued eligibility for the benefits provided under the Class C classification.

The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports by all Class
C recipients as to the use of the property and the number of persons employed at the Class
C site. Such reports shall be verified. Failure to file such reports within the time established
by the Assessor's rules shall result in loss of the incentive for the period relating to the nonfiling.

(9) Class 7a. Real estate used primarily for commercial purposes, comprising a qualified commercial
development project, as determined pursuant to Section 74-65(a), located in an area in need of
commercial development, where total development costs, exclusive of land, do not exceed
$2,000,000.00, consisting of all newly constructed buildings or other structures, including the
land upon which they are situated; or abandoned property, as defined in this Division, including
the land upon which such property is situated; or all buildings and other structures which are
substantially rehabilitated to the extent such rehabilitation has added to their value, including
qualified land related to the rehabilitation. Land qualifies when the rehabilitation adds vertical or
horizontal square footage to the improvements. The amount of land eligible for the incentive shall
be in such proportion as the square footage added by the rehabilitation bears to the total square
footage of the improvements on the parcel.
a.

In the instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as
defined herein, the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may still determine
that special circumstances justify that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of
Class 7a. The finding of abandonment, along with the specification of the special
circumstances, shall be included in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and consenting
to the Class 7a application. Notwithstanding the foregoing, special circumstances may not
be determined to justify finding that a property is deemed "abandoned" where:
A. There has been a purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have not
been vacant and unused prior to such purchase; or
B.

There has been no purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have been
vacant and unused for less than 24 continuous months.

Such Resolution or Ordinance must be filed with the eligibility application. If the Ordinance
or Resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the County Board is required to
validate such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 7a and
a Resolution to that effect shall be included with the Class 7a eligibility application filed
with the Assessor.
b.

This classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the date such new construction
(excluding demolition, if any) or such substantial rehabilitation was completed and initially
assessed, or in the case of abandoned property, from the date of substantial re-occupancy.
After such 12-year period, the real estate shall revert to the applicable classification under
this Division.

c.

The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports by all Class
7a recipients as to the use of the property and the number of persons employed at the Class
7a site. Such reports shall be verified. Failure to file such reports within the time established

by the Assessor's rules shall result in loss of the incentive for the period relating to the nonfiling.
(10) Class 7b. Real estate used primarily for commercial purposes, as defined in this Division,
comprising a qualified commercial development project, as determined pursuant to Section 7465(a), located in an "area in need of commercial development", where total development costs,
exclusive of land, exceed $2,000,000.00, consisting of all newly constructed buildings or other
structures, including the land upon which they are situated; or abandoned property, as defined
herein, including the land upon which such property is situated; or all buildings and other
structures which are substantially rehabilitated to the extent such rehabilitation has added to their
value, including qualified land related to the rehabilitation. Land qualifies when the rehabilitation
adds vertical or horizontal square footage to the improvements. The amount of land eligible for
the incentive shall be in such proportion as the square footage added by the rehabilitation bears
to the total square footage of the improvements on the parcel.
a.

In the instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as
defined herein, the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may still determine
that special circumstances justify finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for
purposes of Class 7b. The finding of abandonment, along with the specification of the special
circumstances, shall be included in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and consenting
to the Class 7b application. Notwithstanding the foregoing, special circumstances may not
be determined to justify finding that a property is deemed "abandoned" where:
A. There has been a purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have not
been vacant and unused prior to such purchase; or
B.

There has been no purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have been
vacant and unused for less than 24 continuous months.

Such Resolution or Ordinance must be filed with the eligibility application. If the ordinance
or resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the County Board is required to
validate such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 7b
and a resolution to that effect shall be included with the Class 7b eligibility application filed
with the Assessor.
b.

This classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the date such new construction
(excluding demolition, if any) or such substantial rehabilitation was completed and initially
assessed, or in the case of abandoned property, from the date of substantial re-occupancy.

c.

The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports by all Class
7b recipients as to the use of the property and the number of persons employed at the Class
7b site. Such reports shall be verified. Failure to file such reports within the time established
by the Assessor's rules shall result in loss of the incentive for the period relating to the nonfiling.

the land upon which they are situated; or abandoned property, including the land upon which such
property is situated; or all buildings and other structures which are substantially rehabilitated to
the extent such rehabilitation has added to their value, including qualified land related to the
rehabilitation. Land qualifies when the rehabilitation adds vertical or horizontal square footage to
the improvements. The amount of land eligible for the incentive shall be in such proportion as the
square footage added by the rehabilitation bears to the total square footage of the improvements
on the parcel.
a.

An applicant must obtain from the municipality in which the real estate is located or the
County Board if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, an Ordinance or
Resolution expressly stating that:
(i)

The property, site, or area is deemed a redevelopment priority by the municipality, and

(ii) The municipality or County Board, as the case may be, has determined that the incentive
provided by Class 7c is necessary for development to occur on that specific real estate
and that the municipality or County Board, as the case may be, supports and consents
to the Class 7c application to the Assessor.
In order to determine Class 7c applications, an application for Class 7c shall be submitted to
the Assessor and the Bureau of Economic Development. Upon receipt of the application and
all the necessary supporting data, the Economic Development Advisory Committee of the
County, within 30 days return the application to the Assessor with a finding stating whether
the conditions of Subsections (a)(1)-(a)(4) of this Section are present. The Assessor shall
review the application, supporting data, findings of the Committee and other appropriate
facts. Where the Assessor finds the conditions of Subsections (a)(1)-(a)(4) of this Section
exist, the Assessor shall, within 30 days of the receipt of the Committee's findings, certify
the commercial development project eligible for Class 7c treatment under this Division.
Where the Economic Development Advisory Committee does not return a finding stating
whether the conditions of Subsections (a)(1)-(a)(4) of this Section are present within 30 days,
and upon further application of the requesting party, the Assessor may review the
application, supporting data, and other appropriate facts and certify the commercial
development project eligible for Class 7c treatment and grant the incentive.
(1) That the Property's (the real estate that is subject of the Incentive application) Assessed
Value, Equalized Assessed Value or Real estate taxes for three of the last six years,
have declined or remained stagnant due to the depressed condition;
(2) There is a reasonable expectation that the development, re-development or
rehabilitation of the commercial development project is viable and likely to go forward
on a reasonably timely basis if granted Class 7c designation and will therefore result in
the economic enhancement of the property;
(3) Certification of the commercial development project for Class 7c designation will
materially assist development, redevelopment or rehabilitation of the property and the

Page 160 of 378

commercial development property would not go forward without the full incentive
offered under Class 7c; and
(4) Certification of the commercial development project for Class 7c designation is
reasonably expected to ultimately result in an increase in real property tax revenue and
employment opportunities of the property.
b.

A certified copy of the Ordinance or Resolution need not be filed at the time of filing the
Class 7c eligibility application with the Assessor, but must be filed with the Assessor no later
than the date an assessment appeal is filed to request the class change to Class 7c. If the
Resolution is not filed at the time of the eligibility application, the applicant may instead file,
at that time, a letter from the municipality or the County, as the case may be, confirming that
a Resolution or Ordinance supporting the incentive has been requested.

c.

A copy of the Resolution or letter confirming that a Resolution has been requested,
whichever is filed with the application, will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the
Secretary of the County Board for distribution to the members of the County Board from the
affected districts.

i.

Renewal. The Class 7c Incentive shall be limited to only one renewal. The applicant may
apply for a renewal on or after the third year of the Incentive, but before the expiration of
the fifth year of the Incentive. The applicant must obtain the municipal enabling Ordinance
and present such municipal Ordinance to the Board of Commissioners of Cook County as to
whether it will validate the renewal. The Incentive may be renewed unless otherwise limited
herein.

j.

Effective Year. The Class 7c Incentive shall be effective for the tax year the application for
the Incentive is filed. In addition, the Class 7c Incentive may be applied for only one year
prior to the tax year in which the Incentive was applied via a certificate of error.

(12) Class 8. Real estate used primarily for industrial and commercial purposes, consisting of all newly
constructed buildings or other structures, including the land upon which they are situated; or
abandoned property, as defined in this division, including the land upon which such property is
situated; or all buildings and other structures which are substantially rehabilitated to the extent
such rehabilitation has added to their value, including qualified land related to the rehabilitation.
a.

b.

Land qualifies when the rehabilitation adds vertical or horizontal square footage to the
improvements. The amount of land eligible for the incentive shall be in such proportion as
the square footage added by the rehabilitation bears to the total square footage of the
improvements on the parcel. Such real estate must be either obtained through the Cook
County Tax Reactivation Project or must be located in one of the following designated
geographical areas:
1.

An area which has been certified as in need of substantial revitalization in accordance
with the provisions of Section 74-65(b);

2.

An enterprise community as proposed and approved by the County Board on June 22,
1994, or the Chicago City Council on May 18, 1994, and the municipality in which such
real estate is located, or, if in an unincorporated area, the County must by lawful
Resolution determine that such real estate is consistent with an overall plan for the
rehabilitation of the area; or

3.

Any one of the following five townships: Bloom, Bremen, Calumet, Rich and Thornton.

In the instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as
defined herein, the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may still determine
that special circumstances justify that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purpose of
Class 8, unless:
1.

There has been a purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have not
been vacant and unused prior to such purchase; or

2.

There has been no purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have been
vacant and unused for less than 24 continuous months.

application. If the Ordinance or Resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the
County Board is required to validate such, a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned"
for purposes of Class 8, and a Resolution to that effect shall be obtained. The applicant must
obtain the municipal enabling Ordinance with the required finding of special circumstances
and present such municipal Ordinance to the Board of Commissioners of Cook County prior

or Ordinance regarding special circumstances has been requested.
Temporary Emergency Economic Recovery Modification (TEERM) Program: In the
instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as defined
herein, the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may still determine that
special circumstances justify that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purpose of Class
8 under the TEERM Program, if there has been no purchase for value and the buildings and
other structures have been vacant and unused for at least 12 continuous months. The finding
of abandonment, along with the specification of the special circumstances, shall be included
in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and consenting to the Class 8 application. If the
Ordinance or Resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the County Board is
required to validate such, a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of
Class 8, and a Resolution to that effect shall be obtained. The applicant must obtain the
municipal enabling Ordinance with the required finding of special circumstances and present
such municipal Ordinance to the Board of Commissioners of Cook County prior to its
determination as to whether it will validate such a finding that the property is deemed
"abandoned" for purposes of Class 8 and provide a County Resolution to that effect. A

property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 8 need not be filed at the time of filing
the Class 8 application with the Assessor, but must be filed with the Assessor no later than

is not filed at the time of the Class 8 application, the applicant shall instead file, at that time,
a letter from the municipality or the County as the case may be, confirming that a Resolution
or Ordinance regarding special circumstances has been requested.
Applications for the TEERM Program must be received by the Assessor's Office on or before
November 30, 2018 to receive consideration.

supports and consents to renewal of the Class 8; and

3.

A copy of that Resolution and a completed renewal application are filed with the

The Assessor may adopt rules consistent with this subsection necessary to ensure proper
review of all factors relevant to determine eligibility for the benefits provided under Class 8.

j.

c.

Upon completion of the major rehabilitation, the applicant must supplement the application
by submitting evidence showing that major rehabilitation did, in fact, occur, the date that the
major rehabilitation was completed and that the real estate complies with all applicable local
building, safety and health requirements and codes. Upon completion of the new
construction, the applicant must supplement the application by submitting an occupancy
permit showing the date that the new construction was completed and ready for occupancy,
and evidence that the real estate complies with all applicable local building, safety and health
requirements and codes.

d.

Beginning January 1, 2000, the Class 9 classification shall have an initial duration of ten
years from the date that the major rehabilitation was completed. That period may be extended
for additional ten-year periods if:

e.

1.

An application is filed with the Assessor at least 12 months before the expiration of the
incentive period;

2.

The applicant presents evidence that the real estate currently complies with all
applicable local building, safety and health requirements and codes; and

3.

the Assessor, the property owner shall, in a manner and form determined by the Assessor,
notify all Class 9 tenants of the date of the termination of Class 9 classification. Once the
Class 9 classification is terminated, the real estate shall revert to the applicable classification

(14) Class S. Real estate otherwise entitled to Class 3 classification under this division, consisting of
land and existing buildings and structures, which is has been subject to a Section 8 contract
renewal. The portion of the land and building eligible for the incentive shall be in such proportion
as the number of Section 8 units bears to the total number of units. The proportion shall be applied
only to property used for residential purposes, and not to portions of the property, if any, used for
commercial purposes.
a.

Property qualifies for the Class S classification if its Section 8 contract has been renewed
pursuant to one of the following alternatives:
1.

HUD has approved renewal of the Section 8 contract under the mark up to market
option, after finding that:
i.

The property has received a physical inspection score of at least 60, in an

safety (EHS) violations;
Page 166 of 378

 Board of Commissioners

ii.

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

September 14, 2016

The property does not have a low- and moderate-income use restriction that cannot
be eliminated by unilateral action by the owner. If, however, the current rent is
lower than the use restriction, HUD may use the mark up to market option to
increase the rents to the use restriction level, which would be a renewal qualifying
for the S classification; and

iii. A rent comparability study conducted by HUD has demonstrated that comparable
market rents are above 100 percent of the HUD Fair Market Rent.
2.

HUD has approved a contract renewal for five years of the Section 8 contract under the
mark up to market under HUD's discretionary authority, after finding that the property
meets at least one of the required criteria:
i.

A vulnerable population is affected,

ii.

There is a low vacancy rate in the area, which would make tenant based assistance
difficult to use, or a lack of comparable housing, or

iii. The project is a high priority for the local community, as demonstrated by a
contribution of state or local funds to the property.
3.

b.

c.

HUD has approved renewal of a Section 8 contract for a not for profit corporation under
any available option under HUD's renewal procedures as described in HUD's Section 8
Renewal Policy Guidelines.

Additional requirements for qualification for the S classification are:
1.

At least 20 percent of the living units must be Section 8 units for qualifying low- and
moderate-income persons.

2.

The owner must agree to retain at least the existing number of Section 8 units for at
least five years after the expiration of the expiring or expired Section 8 contract.

3.

For the duration of the Class S classification period, applicant must file annually with
the Assessor, on or before a date determined by the Assessor, a sworn statement
verifying continuous compliance with the Class S provisions of this Division.

4.

Applicant must agree to notify the Assessor's Office if the Section 8 contract is
terminated prior to its expiration date. Applicant shall provide to the Assessor's office
a copy of any notice of default or notice of abatement received from HUD.

When the applicant applies to HUD for a contract renewal, no less than 120 days prior to the
expiration of the contract, the applicant shall notify the Assessor's Office of the application,
on a form provided by that office. Upon receiving approval of the contract renewal from
HUD, the applicant shall file an application for the incentive with the Assessor's Office, on

Page 167 of 378

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

September 14, 2016

a form provided by that office. The application shall be supported by a copy of HUD's letter
approving the contract renewal and a copy of the executed renewal contract.
d.

Any property which, as of November 23, 1999, has an existing Section 8 contract with a
mark up to market option may apply for Class S classification for the any portion of the 2001
assessment year encompassed within the contract term, and for the remainder of the contract
term, including any renewals approved with the mark up to market option. The classification
shall continue until the expiration or termination of the Section 8 contract.
Any property which, as of (DATE AMENDMENT APPROVED), has an existing Section 8
contract renewal may apply for Class S classification for any portion of the 2006 assessment
year encompassed within the contract term, and for the remainder of the contract term,
including any renewals approved with the mark up to market option, mark up to market
option under HUD's discretionary authority or a Section 8 contract that has been renewed by
a not-for-profit corporation under any available option under HUD's renewal procedures as
described in HUD's Section 8 Renewal Policy Guidelines. The classification shall continue
until the expiration or termination of the Section 8 contract.

e.

The incentive may be renewed if the Section 8 contract is again renewed under any of the
following three options: 1) the mark up to market option; 2) the mark up to market option
under HUD's discretionary authority; or 3) by a not-for-profit corporation under any
available option under HUD's renewal procedures as described in HUD's Section 8 Renewal
Policy Guidelines. Upon filing an application with HUD, no less than 120 days prior to
termination of the contract, for renewal of the Section 8 contract, the taxpayer shall provide
notice to the Assessor's Office of its application for renewal. The taxpayer shall provide a
copy to the Assessor's Office of HUD's approval of the contract renewal, or notification of
other action.

f.

The Assessor's Office shall adopt rules consistent with this subsection necessary to ensure
proper review of all factors relevant to determine initial and continued eligibility for the
benefits provided under Class S.

(15) Class L. Real estate which is to be used for commercial or industrial purposes and which is
designated as Class 3, Class 4, Class 5a or Class 5b pursuant to this Division; is a landmark or
contributing building; and has undergone substantial rehabilitation. The substantial rehabilitation
must constitute an investment by the owner of at least 50 percent of the building's full market
value as determined by the Assessor in the assessment year prior to the commencement of the
substantial rehabilitation.
a.

Generally, the incentive shall apply only to the building and will not apply to the land
underneath the building. However, if the entire building has been vacant and unused for at
least 24 continuous months prior to the filing of the eligibility application with the Assessor,
the land upon which the building is situated shall also be eligible for the incentive.

b.

Prior to filing a Class L eligibility application with the Assessor, an applicant must obtain an
Ordinance or Resolution from the unit of local government in which the real estate is located,
which expressly states that the local government:
Page 168 of 378

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

September 14, 2016

1.

Has determined that the incentive provided by Class L is necessary for the substantial
rehabilitation of the property;

2.

Supports and consents to the granting of the incentive; and

3.

Has reviewed and accepted its preservation commission's written recommendation of
the project for the Class L incentive. This recommendation will specify the project's
budget and proposed scope of work and will specify that the project will meets or
exceeds the Standards of the United States Department of the Interior for Rehabilitation,
Preservation, Restoration, and Reconstruction of historic properties.

c.

A certified copy of the Ordinance or Resolution need not be filed with the Assessor at the
time the Class L eligibility application is filed but the Ordinance or Resolution must be filed
with the Assessor no later than the date an assessment appeal is filed to request the class
change to Class L.

d.

If the Ordinance or Resolution is not filed at the time of the eligibility application is filed,
the applicant shall instead, include the following items with the eligibility application:
1.

A letter from the municipality or the County, as the case may be, confirming that a
Resolution or Ordinance supporting the incentive has been requested; and

2.

A copy of the preservation commission's recommendation of the project.

e.

A copy of the Resolution or letter confirming that a Resolution has been requested,
whichever is filed with the application, will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the
Secretary of the Board for distribution to the members of the County Board from the affected
districts.

f.

Additionally, to qualify a landmark building or contributing building for Class L
classification, an eligibility application must be made to the Assessor within one year prior
to the commencement of substantial rehabilitation. After the substantial rehabilitation has
been completed, the preservation commission shall review the project to determine that it is
eligible under Subsection (14) of this Section. The applicant must supplement the eligibility
application with a copy of the determination of the preservation commission prior to
classification of the real estate as Class L.

g.

The initial Class L classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the date such
substantial rehabilitation was completed and initially assessed.

h.

For property which was initially classified as Class 3, 4 or 5b, this incentive may be renewed
during the last year a property is entitled to a 16-percent assessment level, if the following
requirements are met:

Page 169 of 378

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

September 14, 2016

1.

The taxpayer notifies the Assessor's Office of the taxpayer's intent to request renewal
of the incentive from the municipality, or the County Board if the real estate is located
in an unincorporated area;

2.

The municipality in which the real estate is located or the County Board, if the real
estate is located in an unincorporated area, adopts a resolution expressly stating that the
municipality or County Board, as the case may be, has determined that the industrial
use of the property is necessary and beneficial to the local economy, and supports and
consents to renewal of the Class L; and

3.

A copy of that Resolution and a completed renewal application are filed with the Office
of the Assessor before the expiration of the incentive period.
The number of renewal periods is not limited as long as the property continues to apply
and qualify for Class L. The notice of intent to request renewal which is filed with the
Assessor's Office will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the
County Board for distribution to members of the County Board from the affected
districts.

i.

If, as of November 23, 1999, a property is receiving Class L treatment, but the assessment
level is higher than 16 percent, that taxpayer may apply for renewal as outlined above and
receive a 16-percent assessment level for the prescribed period beginning after the filing and
approval of the Resolution and renewal application. However, if as of the effective date, the
taxpayer's assessment is higher than 16 percent and the taxpayer is granted a renewal of the
incentive for subsequent years, no reduction of the current assessment level based on renewal
of the incentive will be granted. If no renewal is obtained, the incentive shall be phased out
over the next two years, pursuant to Section 74-64. After expiration of the last incentive
period, the real estate shall revert to the applicable classification under this Division.

j.

For commercial properties, once the original 12-year incentive period has expired, the
commercial Class L incentive will expire. The incentive classification will not be subject to
renewal and the real estate shall revert to the applicable classification under this Division.

k.

The Assessor shall adopt rules consistent with the foregoing necessary to ensure proper
review of all factors relevant to determine initial and continued eligibility for the benefits
provided under Class L.

l.

The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports by all Class
L recipients as to the continued landmark status of the property and the number of persons
employed at the Class L site. Failure to file such reports within the time established by the
Assessor's rules may result in loss of the incentive for the period relating to the non-filing.

value, including qualified land related to the rehabilitation. Land qualifies when the rehabilitation
adds vertical or horizontal square footage to the improvements. The amount of land eligible for
the incentive shall be in such proportion as the square footage added by the rehabilitation bears
to the total square footage of the improvements on the parcel.
a.An applicant must obtain from the municipality in which the real estate is located or the
County Board if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, an Ordinance or
Resolution expressly stating that the municipality or County Board, as the case may be, has
determined that the incentive provided by Class 6b is necessary for development to occur on
that specific real estate and that the municipality or County Board, as the case may be,
supports and consents to the Class 6b application to the Assessor. A certified copy of the
Ordinance or Resolution need not be filed at the time of filing the Class 6b eligibility
application with the Assessor, but must be filed with the Assessor no later than the date an
assessment appeal is filed to request the class change to Class 6b. If the Resolution is not
filed at the time of the eligibility application, the applicant shall instead file, at that time, a
letter from the municipality or the County, as the case may be, confirming that a Resolution
or Ordinance supporting the incentive has been requested. If the real estate is located within
an Industrial Growth Zone, prior to filing a Class 6b eligibility application with the Assessor
and in lieu of an Ordinance or Resolution, an applicant must obtain from an authorized
officer of the municipality or an authorized officer of the Cook County Bureau of Economic
Development if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, a letter stating that the
municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, supports and consents to the filing of
the Class 6b application with the Assessor. A certified copy of the authorized officer letter
shall be included with the Class 6b application at the time of filing the application with the
Assessor. The application shall include any other information deemed necessary by the
Assessor. The applicant must demonstrate that the industrial development project qualifies
for the Class 6b classification and shall bear the expense of doing so.
b.

A copy of the Resolution, or letter confirming that a Resolution has been requested, or the
letter from an authorized officer if the real estate is in an Industrial Growth Zone, whichever
is filed with the application, will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of
the County Board for distribution to the members of the County Board from the affected
districts.

c.

Class 6b applications for newly constructed or substantially rehabilitated buildings and other
structures must be made to the Assessor within one year prior to the commencement of such
new construction or substantial rehabilitation to qualify for a Class 6b incentive. With respect
to abandoned property, the Class 6b application must be made to the Assessor prior to the
commencement of the reoccupation of the vacant and unused property.

d.

In the instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as
defined herein, the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may still determine
that special circumstances justify finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for
purpose of Class 6b, unless:
1.

There has been a purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have not
been vacant and unused prior to such purchase; or
Page 188 of 378

2.

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

September 14, 2016

There has been no purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have been
vacant and unused for less than 24 continuous months.

The finding of abandonment, along with the specification of the special circumstances, shall
be included in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and consenting to the Class 6b
application. If the Ordinance or Resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the
County Board is required to validate such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned"
for purposes of Class 6b, and a County Resolution to that effect shall be obtained. The
applicant must obtain the municipal enabling Ordinance with the required finding of special
circumstances and present such municipal Ordinance to the Board of Commissioners of
Cook County prior to its determination as to whether it will validate such a finding that the
property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b and provide a County Resolution
to that effect. A certified copy of an Ordinance or Resolution finding that special
circumstances exist, as well as a certified copy of a County Ordinance or Resolution
validating such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b
need not be filed at the time of filing the Class 6b eligibility application with the Assessor,
but must be filed with the Assessor no later than the date an assessment appeal is filed to
request the class change to Class 6b. If the Resolution is not filed at the time of the Class 6b
eligibility application, the applicant shall instead file, at that time, a letter from the
municipality or the County as the case may be, confirming that a Resolution or Ordinance
regarding special circumstances has been requested.
If the real estate is located within an Industrial Growth Zone, prior to filing a Class 6b
eligibility application with the Assessor and in lieu of an Ordinance or Resolution, an
applicant must obtain from an authorized officer of the municipality or an authorized officer
of the Cook County Bureau of Economic Development if the real estate is located in an
unincorporated area, a letter stating that the municipality or the County Board, as the case
may be, supports and consents to the filing of the Class 6b application with the Assessor. A
certified copy of the authorized officer letter shall be included with the Class 6b application
at the time of filing the application with the Assessor. The application shall include any other
information deemed necessary by the Assessor. The applicant must demonstrate that the
industrial development project qualifies for the Class 6b classification and shall bear the
expense of doing so.
Temporary Emergency Economic Recovery Modification (TEERM) Program: In the
instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as defined
herein, the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may still determine that
special circumstances justify finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purpose
of a Class 6b under the TEERM Program if there has been no purchase for value and the
buildings and other structures have been vacant and unused for at least 12 continuous
months. The finding of abandonment, along with the specification of the special
circumstances, shall be included in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and consenting
to the Class 6b application under the TEERM Program. If the Ordinance or Resolution is
that of a municipality, the approval of the County Board is required to validate such a finding
that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b, and a County Resolution
to that effect shall be obtained. The applicant must obtain the municipal enabling Ordinance
Page 189 of 378

with the required finding of special circumstances and present such municipal Ordinance to
the Board of Commissioners of Cook County prior to its determination as to whether it will
validate such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b
and provide a County Resolution to that effect. A certified copy of an Ordinance or
Resolution finding that special circumstances exist, as well as a certified copy of a County
Ordinance or Resolution validating such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned"
for purposes of Class 6b need not be filed at the time of filing the Class 6b application with
the Assessor, but must be filed with the Assessor no later than the date an assessment appeal
is filed to request the class change to Class 6b. If the Resolution is not filed at the time of the
Class 6b application, the applicant shall instead file, at that time, a letter from the
municipality or the County as the case may be, confirming that a Resolution or Ordinance
regarding special circumstances has been requested.
Sustainable Emergency Relief (SER) Program: In the instance where real estate does not
meet the definition of abandoned property as defined herein, the municipality or the County
Board, as the case may be, may still determine that special circumstances justify finding that
the property is deemed "qualified" for purpose of Class 6b under the SER Program if:
1.

The industrial enterprise that occupies the premises has been at the same location for a
minimum of ten years prior to the date of application for the SER Program; and

2.

The industrial enterprise that occupies the premises submits evidence of hardship
supporting a determination that participation in the SER Program is necessary for the
industrial enterprise to continue operations at its current location and maintain its staff,
and that without such designation the industrial enterprise would not be economically
viable causing the property to be in imminent risk of becoming vacant and unused.

The finding that a property is qualified, along with the specification of the special
circumstances, and a determination that the applicant's participation in the SER Program is
necessary for the industrial enterprise to continue operations at its current location and
maintain its staff, and that without such designation the industrial enterprise would not be
economically viable causing the property to be in imminent risk of becoming vacant and
unused, shall be included in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and consenting to the
Class 6b application. If the Ordinance or Resolution is that of a municipality, the approval
of the County Board is required to validate such a finding that the property is deemed
"qualified" for purposes of Class 6b, and a County Resolution to that effect shall be obtained.
The applicant must obtain the municipal enabling Ordinance with the required finding of
special circumstances and present such municipal Ordinance to the Board of Commissioners
of Cook County prior to its determination as to whether it will validate such a finding that
the property is deemed "qualified" for purposes of Class 6b and provide a County Resolution
to that effect. A certified copy of an Ordinance or Resolution finding that special
circumstances exist, as well as a certified copy of a County Ordinance or Resolution
validating such a finding that the property is deemed "qualified" for purposes of Class 6b
need not be filed at the time of filing the Class 6b application with the Assessor, but must be
filed with the Assessor no later than the date an assessment appeal is filed to request the class
change to Class 6b. If the Resolution is not filed at the time of the Class 6b application, the
applicant shall instead file, at that time, a letter from the municipality or the County as the
Page 190 of 378

case may be, confirming that a Resolution or Ordinance regarding special circumstances has
been requested.
Applications for the TEERM Program or SER Program under a Class 6b application must
be received by the Assessor's Office on or before November 30, 2018 to receive
consideration.
The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of annual reports by recipients of Class 6b
incentives granted pursuant to the SER Program as to the use of the property and the number
of persons employed at the Class 6b site. In such reports, recipients shall be required to
certify whether the industrial enterprise that occupied the premises at the time of the SER
application continues its operations at that location. In addition, recipients of Class 6b
incentives granted pursuant to the SER Program shall be required to report to the Assessor
within 30 days if the industrial enterprise that occupied the premises at the time of the SER
application ceases operations at that location. A copy of such reports will be forwarded by
the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the County Board for distribution to members of the
County Board from the affected districts. Failure to file such reports within the time
established by the Assessor's rules shall result in loss of the incentive for the period relating
to the non-filing. Additionally, if the industrial enterprise that occupied the premises at the
time of the SER application ceases operations at that location, then the Class 6b incentive
granted pursuant to the SER program shall terminate.
e.

This classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the date such new construction
(excluding demolition, if any) or such substantial rehabilitation was completed and initially
assessed, or in the case of abandoned property, from the date of substantial re-occupancy, or
in the case of incentives granted pursuant to the TEERM Program, from the date of the notice
of approval. In the case of incentives granted pursuant to the SER Program, this classification
shall continue for a period of 12 years from the date of the notice of approval, or until the
industrial enterprise that occupied the premises at the time of the SER application ceases
operations at that location if that occurs sooner.

f.

Unless a Class 6b granted pursuant to the TEERM Program or the SER Program, this
incentive may be renewed during the last year a property is entitled to a ten percent
assessment level pursuant to Section 74-64(7), if the following requirements are met:
1.

The taxpayer notifies the Assessor's Office of intent to request renewal of the incentive
from the municipality or the County Board if the real estate is located in an
unincorporated area;

2.

The municipality in which the real estate is located or the County Board, if the real
estate is located in an unincorporated area, adopts a Resolution expressly stating that
the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, has determined that the
industrial use of the property is necessary and beneficial to the local economy, and
supports and consents to renewal of the Class 6b; provided, however, that if the real
estate is located within an Industrial Growth Zone, in lieu of a Resolution, may provide
from an authorized officer of the municipality or an authorized officer of the Cook
County Bureau of Economic Development if the real estate is located in an
Page 191 of 378

unincorporated area, a certified letter stating that the municipality or the County Board,
as the case may be, supports and consents to the renewal of the Class 6b; and
3.

A copy of that Resolution or certified authorization letter (if applicable) and a
completed renewal application are filed with the Assessor's Office before the expiration
of the ten percent assessment level period.

g.

Class 6b incentives that are granted pursuant to the TEERM Program or SER Program are
not renewable. For all other Class 6b incentives, the number of renewal periods is not limited
as long as the property continues to apply and meet the requirements for Class 6b.

h.

A copy of the request for renewal of the incentive will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office
to the Secretary of the County Board for distribution to members of the County Board from
the affected districts.

i.

If no renewal is obtained, the incentive shall be phased out over the next two years, pursuant
to Section 74-64(7). After expiration of the last incentive period, the real estate shall revert
to the applicable classification under this Division.

j.

The Assessor may adopt rules consistent with this subsection necessary to ensure proper
review of all factors relevant to determine eligibility for the benefits provided under Class
6b.

k.

The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports by all Class
6b recipients as to the use of the property and the number of persons employed at the Class
6b site. A copy of such reports will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary
of the County Board for distribution to members of the County Board from the affected
districts. Failure to file such reports within the time established by the Assessor's rules shall
result in loss of the incentive for the period relating to the non-filing.

(8) Class C. Real estate which is to be used for industrial or commercial purposes, including
abandoned property, as defined in Section 74-62, including the land upon which such property is
situated; or vacant land; where such real estate because of contamination has undergone
environmental testing and remediation and has received a "No Further Remediation Letter" from
the site remediation program.
a.

To be eligible for a Class C classification an applicant must have received a "No Further
Remediation Letter" confirming achievement of the remediation objectives based on the
industrial or commercial use.

b.

The owner of the property is rendered ineligible for the Class C classification by having
previously owned or operated the site, directly or indirectly, or having been a partner or being
associated through a family or business relationship with anyone who has owned or operated
the site, which ownership or operation caused the contamination which was remediated
pursuant to a site remediation, except for an employee who worked for an owner, as defined
herein, that operated the site. A present owner or employer who can successfully demonstrate

Page 192 of 378

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

September 14, 2016

that the owner or employer was not responsible for the contamination may be eligible for
Class C classification.
c.

An applicant must obtain from the municipality in which the real estate is located or the
County Board if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, an Ordinance or
Resolution expressly stating that the municipality or County Board, as the case may be, has
determined that the incentive provided by Class C is necessary for development to occur on
that specific real estate and that the municipality or County Board, as the case may be,
supports and consents to the Class C application to the Assessor. A certified copy of the
Ordinance or Resolution must be filed at the time of application for the Class C classification.
A copy of that Ordinance or Resolution, whichever is submitted, will be forwarded by the
Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the Board for distribution to the members of the County
Board from the affected districts.

d.

To qualify for the Class C classification, an application for Class C classification must be
made within one year of the receipt of the "No Further Remediation Letter". Where an
application for Class C classification encompasses less than all of the contiguous property
owned by the applicant upon which remediation has been completed, the one-year limitation
will be waived for any subsequent separate application for Class C classification for the
remainder or for additional portions of the property, provided that such subsequent
application is made within seven years.

e.

Additionally, to qualify for the Class C classification, the estimated remediation costs,
including site investigation, testing, oversight, remediation and removal costs, monitoring,
and engineering and legal fees associated with the remediation process, must total at least
$100,000.00, or alternatively, must total at least 25 percent of the market value of the real
estate as determined by the Assessor's property record card in the year prior to the
remediation, whichever is less.

f.

The initial Class C classification shall continue for a period of 12 years for both industrial
and commercial property. For industrial property, this incentive may be renewed during the
last year a property is entitled to a 16-percent assessment level, if the following requirements
are met:
1.

The taxpayer notifies the Assessor's Office of the taxpayer's intent to request renewal
of the incentive from the municipality, or the County Board if the real estate is located
in an unincorporated area;

2.

The municipality in which the real estate is located or the County Board, if the real
estate is located in an unincorporated area, adopts a Resolution expressly stating that
the municipality or County Board, as the case may be, has determined that the industrial
use of the property is necessary and beneficial to the local economy, and supports and
consents to renewal of the Class C; and

3.

A copy of that Resolution and a completed renewal application are filed with the Office
of the Assessor before the expiration of the 16-percent assessment level period.

Page 193 of 378

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

September 14, 2016

The number of renewal periods is not limited as long as the property continues to apply and
qualify for Class C. Any property which applies for Class C treatment on or before the
adoption date of the ordinance from which this division is derived will be eligible for this
renewal term at the end of their original incentive period subject to the above requirements.
The notice of intent to request renewal which is filed with the Assessor's Office will be
forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the Board for distribution to members
of the County Board from the effected districts.
g.

If, on November 23, 1999, a property is receiving Class C treatment, but the assessment level
is higher than 16 percent, that taxpayer may apply for renewal as outlined above and receive
a 16-percent assessment level for the prescribed period beginning after the filing and
approval of the resolution and renewal application. However, if, as of that effective date, the
taxpayer's assessment is higher than 16 percent and the taxpayer is granted a renewal of the
incentive for subsequent years, no reduction of the current assessment level based on renewal
of the incentive will be granted. If no renewal is obtained, the incentive shall be phased out
over the next two years, pursuant to Section 74-64. After such ten-year period expiration of
the last incentive period, the real estate shall revert to the applicable classification under this
Division.

h.

For commercial properties, once the original 12-year incentive period has expired, the
commercial Class C incentive will expire. The incentive classification will not be subject to
renewal and the real estate shall revert to the applicable classification under this Division.

i.

The Assessor shall review the application and supporting documentation to determine
eligibility for the Class C classification. The Assessor may adopt rules consistent with the
foregoing necessary to ensure proper review of all factors relevant to determine initial and
continued eligibility for the benefits provided under the Class C classification.

j.

The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports by all Class
C recipients as to the use of the property and the number of persons employed at the Class
C site. Such reports shall be verified. Failure to file such reports within the time established
by the Assessor's rules shall result in loss of the incentive for the period relating to the nonfiling.

(9) Class 7a. Real estate used primarily for commercial purposes, comprising a qualified commercial
development project, as determined pursuant to Section 74-65(a), located in an area in need of
commercial development, where total development costs, exclusive of land, do not exceed
$2,000,000.00, consisting of all newly constructed buildings or other structures, including the
land upon which they are situated; or abandoned property, as defined in this Division, including
the land upon which such property is situated; or all buildings and other structures which are
substantially rehabilitated to the extent such rehabilitation has added to their value, including
qualified land related to the rehabilitation. Land qualifies when the rehabilitation adds vertical or
horizontal square footage to the improvements. The amount of land eligible for the incentive shall
be in such proportion as the square footage added by the rehabilitation bears to the total square
footage of the improvements on the parcel.

In the instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as
defined herein, the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may still determine
that special circumstances justify that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of
Class 7a. The finding of abandonment, along with the specification of the special
circumstances, shall be included in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and consenting
to the Class 7a application. Notwithstanding the foregoing, special circumstances may not
be determined to justify finding that a property is deemed "abandoned" where:
A. There has been a purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have not
been vacant and unused prior to such purchase; or
B.

There has been no purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have been
vacant and unused for less than 24 continuous months.

Such Resolution or Ordinance must be filed with the eligibility application. If the Ordinance
or Resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the County Board is required to
validate such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 7a and
a Resolution to that effect shall be included with the Class 7a eligibility application filed
with the Assessor.
b.

This classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the date such new construction
(excluding demolition, if any) or such substantial rehabilitation was completed and initially
assessed, or in the case of abandoned property, from the date of substantial re-occupancy.
After such 12-year period, the real estate shall revert to the applicable classification under
this Division.

c.

The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports by all Class
7a recipients as to the use of the property and the number of persons employed at the Class
7a site. Such reports shall be verified. Failure to file such reports within the time established
by the Assessor's rules shall result in loss of the incentive for the period relating to the nonfiling.

(10) Class 7b. Real estate used primarily for commercial purposes, as defined in this Division,
comprising a qualified commercial development project, as determined pursuant to Section 7465(a), located in an "area in need of commercial development", where total development costs,
exclusive of land, exceed $2,000,000.00, consisting of all newly constructed buildings or other
structures, including the land upon which they are situated; or abandoned property, as defined
herein, including the land upon which such property is situated; or all buildings and other
structures which are substantially rehabilitated to the extent such rehabilitation has added to their
value, including qualified land related to the rehabilitation. Land qualifies when the rehabilitation
adds vertical or horizontal square footage to the improvements. The amount of land eligible for
the incentive shall be in such proportion as the square footage added by the rehabilitation bears
to the total square footage of the improvements on the parcel.
a.

In the instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as
defined herein, the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may still determine
that special circumstances justify finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for
Page 195 of 378

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

September 14, 2016

purposes of Class 7b. The finding of abandonment, along with the specification of the special
circumstances, shall be included in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and consenting
to the Class 7b application. Notwithstanding the foregoing, special circumstances may not
be determined to justify finding that a property is deemed "abandoned" where:
A. There has been a purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have not
been vacant and unused prior to such purchase; or
B.

There has been no purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have been
vacant and unused for less than 24 continuous months.

Such Resolution or Ordinance must be filed with the eligibility application. If the ordinance
or resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the County Board is required to
validate such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 7b
and a resolution to that effect shall be included with the Class 7b eligibility application filed
with the Assessor.
b.

This classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the date such new construction
(excluding demolition, if any) or such substantial rehabilitation was completed and initially
assessed, or in the case of abandoned property, from the date of substantial re-occupancy.

c.

The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports by all Class
7b recipients as to the use of the property and the number of persons employed at the Class
7b site. Such reports shall be verified. Failure to file such reports within the time established
by the Assessor's rules shall result in loss of the incentive for the period relating to the nonfiling.

(11) Class 7c or Commercial Urban Relief Eligibility ("CURE"). Real estate used primarily for
commercial purposes, consisting of all newly constructed buildings or other structures, including
the land upon which they are situated; or abandoned property, including the land upon which such
property is situated; or all buildings and other structures which are substantially rehabilitated to
the extent such rehabilitation has added to their value, including qualified land related to the
rehabilitation. Land qualifies when the rehabilitation adds vertical or horizontal square footage to
the improvements. The amount of land eligible for the incentive shall be in such proportion as the
square footage added by the rehabilitation bears to the total square footage of the improvements
on the parcel.
a.

An applicant must obtain from the municipality in which the real estate is located or the
County Board if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, an Ordinance or
Resolution expressly stating that:
(i)

The property, site, or area is deemed a redevelopment priority by the municipality, and

(ii) The municipality or County Board, as the case may be, has determined that the incentive
provided by Class 7c is necessary for development to occur on that specific real estate
and that the municipality or County Board, as the case may be, supports and consents
to the Class 7c application to the Assessor.

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

September 14, 2016

In order to determine Class 7c applications, an application for Class 7c shall be submitted to
the Assessor and the Bureau of Economic Development. Upon receipt of the application and
all the necessary supporting data, the Economic Development Advisory Committee of the
County, within 30 days return the application to the Assessor with a finding stating whether
the conditions of Subsections (a)(1)-(a)(4) of this Section are present. The Assessor shall
review the application, supporting data, findings of the Committee and other appropriate
facts. Where the Assessor finds the conditions of Subsections (a)(1)-(a)(4) of this Section
exist, the Assessor shall, within 30 days of the receipt of the Committee's findings, certify
the commercial development project eligible for Class 7c treatment under this Division.
Where the Economic Development Advisory Committee does not return a finding stating
whether the conditions of Subsections (a)(1)-(a)(4) of this Section are present within 30 days,
and upon further application of the requesting party, the Assessor may review the
application, supporting data, and other appropriate facts and certify the commercial
development project eligible for Class 7c treatment and grant the incentive.
(1) That the Property's (the real estate that is subject of the Incentive application) Assessed
Value, Equalized Assessed Value or Real estate taxes for three of the last six years,
have declined or remained stagnant due to the depressed condition;
(2) There is a reasonable expectation that the development, re-development or
rehabilitation of the commercial development project is viable and likely to go forward
on a reasonably timely basis if granted Class 7c designation and will therefore result in
the economic enhancement of the property;
(3) Certification of the commercial development project for Class 7c designation will
materially assist development, redevelopment or rehabilitation of the property and the
commercial development property would not go forward without the full incentive
offered under Class 7c; and
(4) Certification of the commercial development project for Class 7c designation is
reasonably expected to ultimately result in an increase in real property tax revenue and
employment opportunities of the property.
b.

A certified copy of the Ordinance or Resolution need not be filed at the time of filing the
Class 7c eligibility application with the Assessor, but must be filed with the Assessor no later
than the date an assessment appeal is filed to request the class change to Class 7c. If the
Resolution is not filed at the time of the eligibility application, the applicant may instead file,
at that time, a letter from the municipality or the County, as the case may be, confirming that
a Resolution or Ordinance supporting the incentive has been requested.

c.

A copy of the Resolution or letter confirming that a Resolution has been requested,
whichever is filed with the application, will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the
Secretary of the County Board for distribution to the members of the County Board from the
affected districts.

this Incentive [Class 7c] "abandoned property" shall mean property where the buildings and
other structures, or portions thereof, have been vacant and unused for more than 12
continuous months and as established by rule of the Assessor.

e.

This classification shall continue for a period of three years from the date such new
construction (excluding demolition, if any) such substantial rehabilitation was completed
and initially assessed, or in the case of abandoned property, from the date of substantial
occupancy.

f.

Class 7c incentives that are granted are renewable.
The incentive shall be phase out after five years, pursuant to Section 74-64(8). After
expiration of the last incentive period, the real estate shall revert to the applicable
classification under this Division.

g.

The Assessor may adopt rules consistent with this subsection necessary to ensure proper
review of all factors relevant to determine eligibility and continued eligibility for the benefits
provided under Class 7c.

h.

Class 7c Applications must be received by the Assessor's Office on or before November 30,
2019, to receive consideration.

i.

Renewal. The Class 7c Incentive shall be limited to only one renewal. The applicant may
apply for a renewal on or after the third year of the Incentive, but before the expiration of
the fifth year of the Incentive. The applicant must obtain the municipal enabling Ordinance
and present such municipal Ordinance to the Board of Commissioners of Cook County as to
whether it will validate the renewal. The Incentive may be renewed unless otherwise limited
herein.

j.

Effective Year. The Class 7c Incentive shall be effective for the tax year the application for
the Incentive is filed. In addition, the Class 7c Incentive may be applied for only one year
prior to the tax year in which the Incentive was applied via a certificate of error.

(12) Class 8. Real estate used primarily for industrial and commercial purposes, consisting of all newly
constructed buildings or other structures, including the land upon which they are situated; or
abandoned property, as defined in this division, including the land upon which such property is
situated; or all buildings and other structures which are substantially rehabilitated to the extent
such rehabilitation has added to their value, including qualified land related to the rehabilitation.
a.

Land qualifies when the rehabilitation adds vertical or horizontal square footage to the
improvements. The amount of land eligible for the incentive shall be in such proportion as
the square footage added by the rehabilitation bears to the total square footage of the

improvements on the parcel. Such real estate must be either obtained through the Cook
County Tax Reactivation Project or must be located in one of the following designated
geographical areas:

b.

1.

An area which has been certified as in need of substantial revitalization in accordance
with the provisions of Section 74-65(b);

2.

An enterprise community as proposed and approved by the County Board on June 22,
1994, or the Chicago City Council on May 18, 1994, and the municipality in which such
real estate is located, or, if in an unincorporated area, the County must by lawful
Resolution determine that such real estate is consistent with an overall plan for the
rehabilitation of the area; or

3.

Any one of the following five townships: Bloom, Bremen, Calumet, Rich and Thornton.

In the instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as
defined herein, the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may still determine
that special circumstances justify that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purpose of
Class 8, unless:
1.

There has been a purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have not
been vacant and unused prior to such purchase; or

2.

There has been no purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have been
vacant and unused for less than 24 continuous months.

The finding of abandonment, along with the specification of the special circumstances, shall
be included in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and consenting to the Class 8
application. If the Ordinance or Resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the
County Board is required to validate such, a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned"
for purposes of Class 8, and a Resolution to that effect shall be obtained. The applicant must
obtain the municipal enabling Ordinance with the required finding of special circumstances
and present such municipal Ordinance to the Board of Commissioners of Cook County prior
to its determination as to whether it will validate such a finding that the property is deemed
"abandoned" for purposes of Class 8 and provide a County Resolution to that effect. A
certified copy of an Ordinance or Resolution finding that special circumstances exist, as well
as a certified copy of a County Ordinance or Resolution validating such a finding that the
property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 8 need not be filed at the time of filing
the Class 8 application with the Assessor, but must be filed with the Assessor no later than
the date an assessment appeal is filed to request the class change to Class 8. If the Resolution
is not filed at the time of the Class 8 application, the applicant shall instead file, at that time,
a letter from the municipality or the County as the case may be, confirming that a Resolution
or Ordinance regarding special circumstances has been requested.
Temporary Emergency Economic Recovery Modification (TEERM) Program: In the
instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as defined
herein, the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may still determine that
Page 199 of 378

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

September 14, 2016

special circumstances justify that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purpose of Class
8 under the TEERM Program, if there has been no purchase for value and the buildings and
other structures have been vacant and unused for at least 12 continuous months. The finding
of abandonment, along with the specification of the special circumstances, shall be included
in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and consenting to the Class 8 application. If the
Ordinance or Resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the County Board is
required to validate such, a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of
Class 8, and a Resolution to that effect shall be obtained. The applicant must obtain the
municipal enabling Ordinance with the required finding of special circumstances and present
such municipal Ordinance to the Board of Commissioners of Cook County prior to its
determination as to whether it will validate such a finding that the property is deemed
"abandoned" for purposes of Class 8 and provide a County Resolution to that effect. A
certified copy of an Ordinance or Resolution finding that special circumstances exist, as well
as a certified copy of a County Ordinance or Resolution validating such a finding that the
property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 8 need not be filed at the time of filing
the Class 8 application with the Assessor, but must be filed with the Assessor no later than
the date an assessment appeal is filed to request the class change to Class 8. If the Resolution
is not filed at the time of the Class 8 application, the applicant shall instead file, at that time,
a letter from the municipality or the County as the case may be, confirming that a Resolution
or Ordinance regarding special circumstances has been requested.
Applications for the TEERM Program must be received by the Assessor's Office on or before
November 30, 2018 to receive consideration.
c.

A copy of the Resolution or letter confirming that a Resolution has been requested,
whichever is filed with the application, will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the
Secretary of the County Board for distribution to the members of the County Board from the
affected districts.

d.

This classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the date of new construction
(excluding demolition, if any) or substantial rehabilitation was completed and initially
assessed, or in the case of abandoned property, from the date of substantial re-occupancy, or
in the case of incentives granted pursuant to the TEERM Program, from the date of the notice
of approval.

e.

Unless it was granted pursuant to the TEERM Program, this incentive may be renewed
during the last year a property is entitled to a ten-percent assessment level pursuant to
[Section] 74-64(11), if the following requirements are met:
1.

The taxpayer notifies the Assessor's Office of the taxpayer's intent to request renewal
of the incentive from the municipality, or the County Board if the real estate is located
in an unincorporated area;

2.

The municipality in which the real estate is located or the County Board, if the real
estate is located in an unincorporated area, adopts a Resolution expressly stating that
the municipality or County Board, as the case may be, has determined that the industrial

or commercial use of the property is necessary and beneficial to the local economy, and
supports and consents to renewal of the Class 8; and
3.

A copy of that Resolution and a completed renewal application are filed with the
Assessor's Office before the expiration of the ten-percent assessment level period.

f.

Class 8 incentives that are granted pursuant to the TEERM Program are not renewable. For
all other Class 8 incentives, the number of renewal periods is not limited as long as the
property continues to apply and meet the requirements for Class 8.

g.

A copy of the request for renewal of the incentive will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office
to the Secretary of the County Board for distribution to the members of the County Board
from the affected districts.

h.

If no renewal is obtained, the incentive shall be phased out over the next two years, pursuant
to Section 74-64(11). After expiration of the last incentive period the real estate shall revert
to the applicable classification under this Division.

i.

The Assessor may adopt rules consistent with this subsection necessary to ensure proper
review of all factors relevant to determine eligibility for the benefits provided under Class 8.

j.

The certification of an area as in need of substantial revitalization shall expire five years
from the date such certification is granted. The Assessor shall notify the applicant of the date
of expiration of certification one year before the date of the expiration of the certification.
Such certification, pursuant to the same criteria, may be extended for one additional fiveyear period subject to reapplication by the appropriate local governing body within the period
from one year to six months prior to the expiration of the initial five-year period.

k.

The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports by all Class
8 recipients as to the use of the property and the number of persons employed at the Class 8
site. A copy of such reports will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of
the County Board for distribution to members of the County Board from the affected
districts. Failure to file such reports within the time established by the Assessor's rules shall
result in loss of the incentive for the period relating to the non-filing.

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

September 14, 2016

The Assessor determines that all application qualifications, except the major
rehabilitation or new construction requirement, were maintained during the incentive
period.

When the Class 9 classification is due to expire or is terminated by action of the owner or
the Assessor, the property owner shall, in a manner and form determined by the Assessor,
notify all Class 9 tenants of the date of the termination of Class 9 classification. Once the
Class 9 classification is terminated, the real estate shall revert to the applicable classification
under this Division.

(14) Class S. Real estate otherwise entitled to Class 3 classification under this division, consisting of
land and existing buildings and structures, which is has been subject to a Section 8 contract
renewal. The portion of the land and building eligible for the incentive shall be in such proportion
as the number of Section 8 units bears to the total number of units. The proportion shall be applied
only to property used for residential purposes, and not to portions of the property, if any, used for
commercial purposes.
a.

Property qualifies for the Class S classification if its Section 8 contract has been renewed
pursuant to one of the following alternatives:
1.

HUD has approved renewal of the Section 8 contract under the mark up to market
option, after finding that:
i.

The property has received a physical inspection score of at least 60, in an
inspection by HUD's Real Estate Assessment Center, confirming that the property
is decent, safe, sanitary and in good repair with no uncorrected exigent health and
safety (EHS) violations;

ii.

The property does not have a low- and moderate-income use restriction that cannot
be eliminated by unilateral action by the owner. If, however, the current rent is
lower than the use restriction, HUD may use the mark up to market option to
increase the rents to the use restriction level, which would be a renewal qualifying
for the S classification; and

iii. A rent comparability study conducted by HUD has demonstrated that comparable
market rents are above 100 percent of the HUD Fair Market Rent.
2.

HUD has approved a contract renewal for five years of the Section 8 contract under the
mark up to market under HUD's discretionary authority, after finding that the property
meets at least one of the required criteria:
i.

A vulnerable population is affected,

ii.

There is a low vacancy rate in the area, which would make tenant based assistance
difficult to use, or a lack of comparable housing, or

Page 203 of 378

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

September 14, 2016

iii. The project is a high priority for the local community, as demonstrated by a
contribution of state or local funds to the property.
3.

b.

HUD has approved renewal of a Section 8 contract for a not for profit corporation under
any available option under HUD's renewal procedures as described in HUD's Section 8
Renewal Policy Guidelines.

Additional requirements for qualification for the S classification are:
1.

At least 20 percent of the living units must be Section 8 units for qualifying low- and
moderate-income persons.

2.

The owner must agree to retain at least the existing number of Section 8 units for at
least five years after the expiration of the expiring or expired Section 8 contract.

3.

For the duration of the Class S classification period, applicant must file annually with
the Assessor, on or before a date determined by the Assessor, a sworn statement
verifying continuous compliance with the Class S provisions of this Division.

4.

Applicant must agree to notify the Assessor's Office if the Section 8 contract is
terminated prior to its expiration date. Applicant shall provide to the Assessor's office
a copy of any notice of default or notice of abatement received from HUD.

c.

When the applicant applies to HUD for a contract renewal, no less than 120 days prior to the
expiration of the contract, the applicant shall notify the Assessor's Office of the application,
on a form provided by that office. Upon receiving approval of the contract renewal from
HUD, the applicant shall file an application for the incentive with the Assessor's Office, on
a form provided by that office. The application shall be supported by a copy of HUD's letter
approving the contract renewal and a copy of the executed renewal contract.

d.

Any property which, as of November 23, 1999, has an existing Section 8 contract with a
mark up to market option may apply for Class S classification for the any portion of the 2001
assessment year encompassed within the contract term, and for the remainder of the contract
term, including any renewals approved with the mark up to market option. The classification
shall continue until the expiration or termination of the Section 8 contract.
Any property which, as of (DATE AMENDMENT APPROVED), has an existing Section 8
contract renewal may apply for Class S classification for any portion of the 2006 assessment
year encompassed within the contract term, and for the remainder of the contract term,
including any renewals approved with the mark up to market option, mark up to market
option under HUD's discretionary authority or a Section 8 contract that has been renewed by
a not-for-profit corporation under any available option under HUD's renewal procedures as
described in HUD's Section 8 Renewal Policy Guidelines. The classification shall continue
until the expiration or termination of the Section 8 contract.

e.

The incentive may be renewed if the Section 8 contract is again renewed under any of the
following three options: 1) the mark up to market option; 2) the mark up to market option
Page 204 of 378

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

September 14, 2016

under HUD's discretionary authority; or 3) by a not-for-profit corporation under any
available option under HUD's renewal procedures as described in HUD's Section 8 Renewal
Policy Guidelines. Upon filing an application with HUD, no less than 120 days prior to
termination of the contract, for renewal of the Section 8 contract, the taxpayer shall provide
notice to the Assessor's Office of its application for renewal. The taxpayer shall provide a
copy to the Assessor's Office of HUD's approval of the contract renewal, or notification of
other action.
f.

The Assessor's Office shall adopt rules consistent with this subsection necessary to ensure
proper review of all factors relevant to determine initial and continued eligibility for the
benefits provided under Class S.

(15) Class L. Real estate which is to be used for commercial or industrial purposes and which is
designated as Class 3, Class 4, Class 5a or Class 5b pursuant to this Division; is a landmark or
contributing building; and has undergone substantial rehabilitation. The substantial rehabilitation
must constitute an investment by the owner of at least 50 percent of the building's full market
value as determined by the Assessor in the assessment year prior to the commencement of the
substantial rehabilitation.
a.

Generally, the incentive shall apply only to the building and will not apply to the land
underneath the building. However, if the entire building has been vacant and unused for at
least 24 continuous months prior to the filing of the eligibility application with the Assessor,
the land upon which the building is situated shall also be eligible for the incentive.

b.

Prior to filing a Class L eligibility application with the Assessor, an applicant must obtain an
Ordinance or Resolution from the unit of local government in which the real estate is located,
which expressly states that the local government:
1.

Has determined that the incentive provided by Class L is necessary for the substantial
rehabilitation of the property;

2.

Supports and consents to the granting of the incentive; and

3.

Has reviewed and accepted its preservation commission's written recommendation of
the project for the Class L incentive. This recommendation will specify the project's
budget and proposed scope of work and will specify that the project will meets or
exceeds the Standards of the United States Department of the Interior for Rehabilitation,
Preservation, Restoration, and Reconstruction of historic properties.

c.

A certified copy of the Ordinance or Resolution need not be filed with the Assessor at the
time the Class L eligibility application is filed but the Ordinance or Resolution must be filed
with the Assessor no later than the date an assessment appeal is filed to request the class
change to Class L.

d.

If the Ordinance or Resolution is not filed at the time of the eligibility application is filed,
the applicant shall instead, include the following items with the eligibility application:

Page 205 of 378

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

September 14, 2016

1.

A letter from the municipality or the County, as the case may be, confirming that a
Resolution or Ordinance supporting the incentive has been requested; and

2.

A copy of the preservation commission's recommendation of the project.

e.

A copy of the Resolution or letter confirming that a Resolution has been requested,
whichever is filed with the application, will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the
Secretary of the Board for distribution to the members of the County Board from the affected
districts.

f.

Additionally, to qualify a landmark building or contributing building for Class L
classification, an eligibility application must be made to the Assessor within one year prior
to the commencement of substantial rehabilitation. After the substantial rehabilitation has
been completed, the preservation commission shall review the project to determine that it is
eligible under Subsection (14) of this Section. The applicant must supplement the eligibility
application with a copy of the determination of the preservation commission prior to
classification of the real estate as Class L.

g.

The initial Class L classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the date such
substantial rehabilitation was completed and initially assessed.

h.

For property which was initially classified as Class 3, 4 or 5b, this incentive may be renewed
during the last year a property is entitled to a 16-percent assessment level, if the following
requirements are met:
1.

The taxpayer notifies the Assessor's Office of the taxpayer's intent to request renewal
of the incentive from the municipality, or the County Board if the real estate is located
in an unincorporated area;

2.

The municipality in which the real estate is located or the County Board, if the real
estate is located in an unincorporated area, adopts a resolution expressly stating that the
municipality or County Board, as the case may be, has determined that the industrial
use of the property is necessary and beneficial to the local economy, and supports and
consents to renewal of the Class L; and

3.

A copy of that Resolution and a completed renewal application are filed with the Office
of the Assessor before the expiration of the incentive period.
The number of renewal periods is not limited as long as the property continues to apply
and qualify for Class L. The notice of intent to request renewal which is filed with the
Assessor's Office will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the
County Board for distribution to members of the County Board from the affected
districts.

i.

If, as of November 23, 1999, a property is receiving Class L treatment, but the assessment
level is higher than 16 percent, that taxpayer may apply for renewal as outlined above and
receive a 16-percent assessment level for the prescribed period beginning after the filing and
Page 206 of 378

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

September 14, 2016

approval of the Resolution and renewal application. However, if as of the effective date, the
taxpayer's assessment is higher than 16 percent and the taxpayer is granted a renewal of the
incentive for subsequent years, no reduction of the current assessment level based on renewal
of the incentive will be granted. If no renewal is obtained, the incentive shall be phased out
over the next two years, pursuant to Section 74-64. After expiration of the last incentive
period, the real estate shall revert to the applicable classification under this Division.
j.

For commercial properties, once the original 12-year incentive period has expired, the
commercial Class L incentive will expire. The incentive classification will not be subject to
renewal and the real estate shall revert to the applicable classification under this Division.

k.

The Assessor shall adopt rules consistent with the foregoing necessary to ensure proper
review of all factors relevant to determine initial and continued eligibility for the benefits
provided under Class L.

l.

The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports by all Class
L recipients as to the continued landmark status of the property and the number of persons
employed at the Class L site. Failure to file such reports within the time established by the
Assessor's rules may result in loss of the incentive for the period relating to the non-filing.

Sec. 74-73. - Revocation or cancellation of incentive classification.
(a)The following Incentive Classifications are subject to revocation herein: Class 6b; Class 6b TEERM;
Class 6b SER; Class 7a; Class 7b; Class 7c; Class 8; and Class 8 TEERM.
(b)The incentive may be revoked under the following circumstances:
1.

By rule, as provided by the Assessor;

2.

By the County Board by Resolution or Ordinance pursuant to a recommendation by the Bureau
of Economic Development;

3.

By the County Board by Resolution or Ordinance at the request of the Municipality's submission
of a Municipal Resolution or Ordinance; and

4.

By request of the taxpayer to cancel.

In case of revocation or cancellation, the Incentive Classification shall be deemed null and void for the
tax year in which the incentive was revoked or cancelled as to the subject property. In such an instance, the
taxpayer shall be liable for and shall reimburse to the County Collector an amount equal to the difference
in the amount of taxes that would have been collected had the subject property been assessed as a Class 5
property and the amount of taxes collected under the Incentive Classification as determined by the Assessor.
Effective date: This ordinance shall be in effect immediately upon adoption ...end
