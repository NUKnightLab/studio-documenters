and Volaris. General Aviation showed an average of 165 operations per day.
Chairman Baliga asked if General Aviation includes the helicopters and Mr.

Midway Noise Compatibility Commission

The most used aircraft, which is used by Southwest, is the newer generation of
the B737.
Permanent Noise Monitor Locations
The report indicates the addresses of all of the noise monitor locations at the
airport. The 2004 noise contour is what is shown. If that changes, the next
meeting will reflect an updated contour.
The report shows 12 month rolling numbers starting with July of 2012 through
June of 2013. It also shows averages by quarter.
Mr. Philbin asked about monitoring locations for the 18th Ward. Mr. Jackson
responded that monitors have up to a five mile range. Mr. Jackson will see if
noise levels are being recorded above the area of the 18th Ward and will provide
Mr. Philbin with the results at the next meeting.
Noise Hotline Report
There was a dramatic increase in the number of complaints this quarter
compared to what is typical. The number went from 66 complaints in the first
quarter to 531 in the second, with 507 of those coming from Chicago. Four
hundred of the Chicago complaints came from two individuals residing just
outside of the noise contour. Of the 400 complaints 133 were nighttime.
CHAIR’S REPORT
A. Residential Sound Insulation Sub-Committee Report
Ms. Conwell presented the Residential Sound Insulation Sub-Committee Report
(see attached).
Chairman Baliga noted that on the 4800 block of South Tripp Avenue, 10 or 12
houses were being worked on at the same time and the crews were doing an
excellent job.
NEW BUSINESS
A. APPROVAL OF THE 2018 NOISE CONTOUR
Ms. Dulaj read the draft Resolution 2013-A.
Chairman Baliga asked if there were questions regarding the Resolution 2013-A.
Mr. Frame asked that the approval date indicated in the third “whereas”
referencing the noise exposure maps for the new Midway Part 150, be changed
from June 26th to read June 20th. A motion to approve the correction was made
by Ms. Dulaj and seconded by Mr. Koczwara. The motion passed.

Midway Noise Compatibility Commission
Mr. Frame explained that the new 2018 Noise Contour reflects a future forecast
which is a key component in seeking federal grant money. Working toward the
future is an FAA requirement.
Chairman Baliga entertained a motion to adopt the Resolution 2013-A as
corrected. The first motion to approve was made by Mayor Klein and seconded
by Mr. Lihosit and Ms. Conwell. Resolution 2013-A was adopted.
Chairman Baliga made the following three requests:
1. That updated versions of exploded maps of the southeast and northeast
corridor runways be provided, indicating flight paths. The maps would chart
the arrivals and departures of the individual planes.
2. That two more noise monitors be added to the existing monitoring system,
one for the northeast and the other for the southeast quadrant. The addition
would more accurately track the changes that will occur in noise under the
new 2018 contour in both of those corridors.
3. The third request was for a graph depicting the decibel noise levels on a
sliding scale. Ms. Conwell asked how it would measure the noise and
Chairman Baliga responded that it would be the noise directly under and to
the sides of the plane. Ms. Conwell stated that it might not offer a complete
noise picture. Mr. Frame added that the scope that would be captured in the
graphic would be 20-30 square miles.
The above requests will be looked into further by Mr. Frame and his staff.
Mr. Lazanski of Stickney suggested that the 4308 Wenonah Avenue noise
monitor be moved further east, closer to the airport.
Mr. Frame discussed the three flyers included in the handouts. The first was the
CDA Midway Flyaway 5K event which benefits the Special Olympics, the second
was the news release stating that Midway Airport received a perfect airfield
safety rating from the FAA this year, and the last was the Request for
Qualifications to bid on the new noise monitor contract. The bid opening date is
August 28th. The procurement process will take approximately six months.
B. DISCUSSION OF THE FUTURE RESIDENTIAL SOUND INSULATION
PROGRAM
Mr. Lihosit asked when the contracts will be let out for bid on the homes
remaining now that the Part 150 Study has been completed.
Mr. Frame’s response was that a resolution for the next 900 homes will be
announced at the MNCC October 2013 quarterly meeting. This next resolution is
in the 15th year of the program and will be known as Midway Phase 15. The

calendar year reference is being eliminated. The same naming convention has
already been implemented at O’Hare.
In response to the written inquiry submitted by the Commission, Mr. Frame, Ms.
Malick, Mr. Jackson and the members of the Residential Sound Insulation team
have been working together with the Building and Law Departments, to
determine the criteria for making certain that the participating homes are building
code compliant.
There were new FAA requirements issued last year that are being integrated into
the new Resolution.
Mr. Frame will request a special Residential Committee meeting in the early part
of October to discuss the various changes. Some of these changes include all
types of residential buildings, condominiums, apartment buildings, and buildings
with more than five units that were not previously eligible for participation.
Chairman Baliga asked if there were any questions or any additional business requiring
further discussion.
Mr. Philbin asked if the new proposed Peotone airport will affect the Midway budget.
Mr. Frame’s response was that funding for the Noise Commission comes from Midway
Airport which is owned and operated by the City of Chicago. The new airport is
sponsored by Will County, the State of Illinois and the FAA.
With no other business, a motion to adjourn was made by Ms. Pinion and seconded by
Ms. Conwell. The motion passed.
MEETING ADJOURNMENT
Chairman Baliga adjourned the meeting at 7:20 p.m. and informed all those present that
the next meeting of the Midway Noise Compatibility Commission will be held on
Thursday, October 24, 2013 at 6:30 p.m. at The Mayfield, Chicago.
