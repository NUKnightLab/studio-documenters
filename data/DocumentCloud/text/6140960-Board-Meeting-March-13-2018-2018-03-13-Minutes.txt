prohibitions on retaliation for reporting sexual harassment allegations and the notification of the

spaces that foster sustainability within Chicago’s communities. Examples of the diverse projects
completed by PBC during 2017 include renovations at Edwards Elementary School and the
Thomas Hughes Children’s Library, decommissioning the vacant Anthony Wing at Chicago

capabilities by completing technology and infrastructure improvements on behalf of the City’s

Further, the Executive Director advised the Commissioners in her report that more than

received $16.6M, or approximately 41.53% participation, while women-owned business
enterprises (WBE) received $2.9 M or approximately 7.32%, for total MBE and WBE
participation of 48.85%. More than $10.4M was earned by 1,037 persons who worked in PBC
projects completed in 2017, and many of those employed were residents of the community areas
where the projects were constructed. On the Richard Edwards Elementary School project
completed in addition to the new annex, 884 workers including 121 community residents earned
more than $9.3M in wages and benefits.
During 2017, PBC also renewed partnerships with the Chicago Park District, City
Colleges of Chicago and the Chicago Transit Authority for the development of new projects.
Also provided to board members was the latest edition of the PBC newsletter, “Constructive
News You Can Use”, which provides information regarding PBC’s current and proposed
projects. Commissioner Clark commended PBC for its extensive community involvement and
outreach efforts, and Chairman Emanuel requested that the Executive Director provide additional
information regarding the hiring of community residents on PBC projects at the next board
meeting.
At the conclusion of the discussion, the report by the Executive Director was accepted.
Next, the Board of Commissioners was presented with consideration of approval to

Title: Anti-Harassment Policy
Document Type: Policy
Number: 188
Author: Chief Administrator Officer
Effective Date: 01/05/2015
Review Date:
Signature:

Version: 1
Department: Administration
Approver: Executive Director

1.0

PURPOSE
1.1.
This policy establishes guidelines to maintain a work environment free of
unlawful conduct, discrimination and harassment.

2.0

DEFINITIONS
2.1.
Sexual Harassment For purposes of this Policy, is defined as unwelcome sexual
advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual
nature when:
2.1.1 Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term
or condition of the individual’s employment;
2.1.2 Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the
basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; or
2.1.3 Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an
individual’s work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or
offensive working environment.
2.2.
Other Harassment
2.2.1 This policy prohibits all forms of harassment, including, but not limited to,
any offensive or inappropriate conduct or comments based on or
motivated by an individual’s race, sex, gender identity, religion, national
origin, disability or any other characteristic protected by law.
2.2.2 In accordance with the PBC’s anti-retaliation policy, the PBC also
prohibits harassment based on the fact that an employee has protested
against discrimination, cooperated in an investigation, or has otherwise
engaged in legally protected activity. Conduct that interferes with an
employee’s work performance or that creates an intimidating hostile or
otherwise offensive work environment is considered harassment.

3.0

RESPONSIBILITIES
3.1
Human Resources is responsible for reporting violations of this policy to the
Executive Director and conducting investigations.
3.2
Non-management employees are strongly encouraged to report any case of
harassment or retaliation in accordance with Section 4.5 of this Policy.
3.3
Supervisors and managers must immediately report allegations of harassment
witnessed or reported, and any other violations to this policy to Human
Resources.

 4.0

POLICY COMPONENTS
4.1
The PBC intends to maintain a workplace free of sexual and other harassment or
intimidation, including, but not limited to harassment based on race, color, sex,
gender identity, religion, national origin, age or disability. The PBC is also
committed to maintaining a workplace free of harassment for not only its
employees, but non-employees, including customers and vendors.
4.2
All employees must be allowed to work in an environment free from unsolicited
and unwelcome sexual overtures and harassment in any form. Sexual and other
harassment is not only offensive, it may also harm morale and interfere with
PBC’s effectiveness and ability to fulfill its responsibilities.
4.3
The PBC has adopted this complaint procedure to assure a prompt, thorough, and
impartial investigation of all complaints of discrimination, harassment and
retaliation. The PBC encourages employees to report harassment and other
inappropriate conduct.
4.4
The complaint and information collected during an investigation will be kept
confidential to the extent possible and will not be disclosed unnecessarily or to
persons not involved directly in conducting the investigation and determining
what action, if any, to take in response to the complaint. Complete confidentiality
cannot be guaranteed because an effective investigation usually requires revealing
certain information to the alleged perpetrator and potential witnesses.
4.5
Reporting
4.5.1 An employee who believes that he or she has been a victim of
discrimination, sexual harassment, other harassment, or retaliation or has
observed these violations of policy is strongly encouraged to report it.
Individuals can make reports to:
4.5.2 Human Resources (this option is preferred)
4.5.3 A supervisor;
4.5.4 A manager;
4.5.5 The PBC Ethics Officer; or
4.5.6 The Inspector General.
4.5.7 Individuals who believe that they have been the victims of sexual
harassment or other violations of the Illinois Human Rights Act also have
the right to file a charge of discrimination with the State of Illinois
Department of Human Rights.
4.5.8 If a supervisor or other member of management is advised of any alleged
violation of this Policy, or he/she independently observes conduct which
may be prohibited by this policy, he/she must immediately report the
matter to Human Resources.
4.6
Remediation
4.6.1 If following a complaint of discrimination, sexual or other harassment, or
retaliation, an investigation reveals that a violation of this policy has
occurred, prompt and appropriate corrective action will be taken. PBC
employees may receive discipline, up to and including discharge, for a
violation of this policy.
4.7
Anti-Retaliation

 4.7.1

4.8
4.9

4.10

The PBC will take appropriate action to ensure that the rights of
individuals to file complaints, furnish information, or participate in
investigations under this policy is respected and not interfered with. It is
against PBC policy to retaliate against an employee who reasonably and in
good faith has filed a charge, complaint, or grievance regarding the terms
or conditions of employment under this policy; and/or against an
employee who has testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an
investigation, proceeding, or hearing regarding such charge, complaint, or
grievance.
4.7.2 There are also state laws that prohibit retaliation.
4.7.2.1 The State Officials and Employees Ethics Act (5 ILCS 430/15-10)
provides state employees with protection from retaliatory action.
4.7.2.2 The Illinois Whistleblower Act (740 ILCS 174/15(a)) provides that
an employer, such as the PBC, may not retaliate against an
employee who discloses information in a court, an administrative
hearing, or before a legislative commission or committee, or in any
other proceeding, where the employee has reasonable cause to
believe that the information discloses a violation of a State or
federal law, rule, or regulation. In addition, an employer, such as
the PBC, may not retaliate against an employee for disclosing
information to a government or law enforcement agency, where the
employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information
discloses a violation of a State or federal law, rule or regulation.
(740 ILCS 174/15(b)).
4.7.2.3 Under the Illinois Human Rights Act (775 ILCS 5/6-101), it is a
civil rights violation for a person, or for two or more people to
conspire, to retaliate against a person because he/she has opposed
that which he/she reasonably and in good faith believes to be
sexual harassment in employment, because he/she has made a
charge, filed a complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in an
investigation, proceeding, or hearing under the Illinois Human
Rights Act.
The PBC’s policy may be broader than state or federal laws.
Violations
4.9.1 Employees who violate this policy are subject to disciplinary action to and
including discharge.
4.9.2 State law provides that any person who violates the prohibition on Sexual
Harassment contained in 5 ILCS 430/5-65, may be subject to a fine of up
to $5,000 per offense.
4.9.3 The Illinois Human Rights Act provides for individual liability for
perpetrators of sexual harassment.
Consequences Of Bad Faith Claims
4.10.1 Individuals who make false claims under this Policy in bad faith are
subject to discipline.
4.10.2 Any person who intentionally makes a false report alleging a violation of
any provision of the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act to an ethics

commission, an inspector general, the State Police, a State’s Attorney, the
Attorney General, or any other law enforcement official is guilty of a
Class A misdemeanor. An ethics commission may levy an administrative
fine of up to $5,000 against any person who intentionally makes a false,
frivolous or bad faith allegation.
QUESTIONS - If any employee has any questions about the policy, the employee should
contact Human Resources.
