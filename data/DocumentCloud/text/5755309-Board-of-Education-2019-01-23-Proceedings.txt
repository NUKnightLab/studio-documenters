THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER REPORTS THE FOLLOWING DECISION:

$450,000. CPS has partnered with Lewis University because it has a certi?ed school nursing program,
offered signi?cant tuition discounts, and provided a fast track for completing the program in two semesters.
No written agreement is required for tuition payments. lnforrnation pertinent to this program is stated below.

PAYMENT PERIOD: Authorization covers tuition payments that accrue between January 23, 2019 and
June 30, 2021. CPS's obligation to cover tuition payment for any course accrues Upon successful
completion of the course by the employee. The ?rst tuition payments will cover university courses for the
Spring 2019 semester, which runs from January 14, 2019 to May 11, 2019. Participants may withdraw from
courses up to and including January 25, 2019 without penalty. In the event this report is not approved by
the Board, participants shall have the option of continuing at their own expense, without reimbursement
from the Board, or withdrawing from the course.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: Payments cover tuition for authorized CPS Health Service Nurses who are
enrolled in courses at Lewis University to earn the credential for Certi?ed School Nurse. Students must
complete 13 credit hours of coursework, including an internship, and pass a nursing content exam. The
course sequence can be completed in two semesters, and Lewis University offers the courses in the fall,
spring, and summer semesters.

PARTICIPANTS: Participants are registered nurses with bachelor's degree who are employed by CPS as
Health Services Nurses. Participants agree that they will ?ll open School Nurse positions upon completion
of the program and remain employed with CPS for at least two years.

OUTCOMES: This program will increase the number of School Nurses that CPS has on staff. CPS has
lost more than 60 School Nurses over the last three years due to retirements and resignations, and hiring
School Nurses is difficult due to the extreme shortage of quail?ed individuals nationwide. We have
determined that our best strategy for recruiting School Nurses is to pay for the training costs. We began
this program in January 2018 under the authority provided by board rule 7-2.3, and have ten candidates
who have completed the program. Board approval is required to continue the program for the remainder
of FY 19 and to expand the program to 25 candidates per year.

$450,000 in total through June 30, 2021.
