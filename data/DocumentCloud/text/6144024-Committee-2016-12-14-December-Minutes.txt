THE FIREMEN’S ANNUITY AND BENEFIT FUND
OF CHICAGO
RESOLUTION HONORING GEORGE S. MOTTO, M.D.

WHEREAS, with deep sadness, tempered by gratitude for the dedicated service of a valued
colleague, the Firemen’s Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago (“Fund”), its Board of Trustees
(“Trustees”), and staff wish to thank Dr. George S. Motto for his lifelong commitment to the Fund;
and
WHEREAS, after graduating with his M.D. degree from Loyola University Stritch School of
Medicine in Chicago, Illinois and completing his residency in Internal Medicine at the University of
Illinois, Dr. Motto served two years in the United States Air Force as Chief of Internal Medicine,
attaining the rank of Major; and
WHEREAS, Dr. Motto was subsequently retained as Physician Consultant for the Firemen’s
Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago in July 1973 during which time he has evaluated thousands of
members of the Chicago Fire Department for disability benefits over the course of forty-three years;
and
WHEREAS, as Physician Consultant, Dr. Motto has assessed gravely ill or injured firefighters
and paramedics with great respect, genuine compassion and the utmost professionalism; and
WHEREAS, in the course of his duties for the Fund, Dr. Motto was instrumental in the
adoption of administrative and legislative changes which allowed firefighters and paramedics
suffering from a terminal illness to apply for and be granted disability benefits prior to the completion
of the mandatory one year layup period, thus providing much needed benefits for their families; and
WHEREAS, while we will deeply miss our friend and colleague, we will take comfort in
knowing that George S. Motto, M.D. will enjoy happiness and success in his future travels and
endeavors; and
NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, on this 14th day of December 2016, the Trustees,
staff and all active and annuitant members of the Firemen’s Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago
wish to honor and thank George S. Motto, M.D. for his unwavering dedication to the Fund. We will
miss his vast medical knowledge, his incomparable professionalism, his good humor, his gentle
manner and his uncompromising dedication and devotion to the Fund and its participants; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, in order that all may know of the esteem and honor in which
this Fund, its Trustees, staff and participants have for George S. Motto, M.D., that this resolution be
entered on the permanent record of the Fund and that a copy of this resolution be suitably engraved
and presented to Dr. Motto as a token of our respect, admiration and gratitude for his significant
contributions and valued service to the members of the Chicago Fire Department and their pension
fund.
