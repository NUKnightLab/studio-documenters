Minutes of the meeting of the Finance Committee of the Board of Directors of the Cook County Health and
Hospitals System held Friday, March 20, 2015 at the hour of 10:00 A.M., at 1900 W. Polk Street, in the Second
Floor Conference Room, Chicago, Illinois.

II.

John Jay Shannon, MD – Chief Executive Officer

Public Speakers
Chairman Collens asked the Secretary to call upon the registered public speakers.
The Secretary called upon the following registered public speaker:
1.

George Blakemore

Concerned Citizen

Following testimony by Mr. Blakemore, during which he implied that there was a conflict of interest with the
contracts being considered, and criticized one of the Directors for not being in attendance at this meeting, Board
Chairman Hammock stated for the record that he has no related or remote connection to any of these contracts; this
is reflected every year by the conflict of interest statement that he and all Board Members are required to submit.
Additionally, he stated that the Director referenced by Mr. Blakemore is not appointed to this committee, so she
would not be expected to be here; she is a practicing physician with a full-time job, so she does not have time to
voluntarily come to meetings that she is not required to attend. Chairman Collens, also stated for the record that no
member of this Board is paid anything; every Director is a volunteer.

III. Action Items
A. Minutes of the Finance Committee Meeting, February 20, 2015
Director Estrada, seconded by Director Wiese, moved to accept the minutes of the
Finance Committee Meeting of February 20, 2015. THE MOTION CARRIED
UNANIMOUSLY.

III. Action Items (continued)
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (Attachment #1)
Douglas Elwell, Deputy CEO of Finance and Strategy, provided an overview of the requests presented for the
Committee’s consideration. The Committee reviewed and discussed the requests.
Review of two of the requests by Contract Compliance has not yet been completed; it was respectfully
requested that the Committee conditionally approve these requests, pending the completion of review by
Contract Compliance.
With regard to request number 3, Mr. Elwell reminded the Committee that the administration was trying to
bring these services in-house, and it was believed that this could be done within the time period originally
anticipated. Originally, this function was designated to go into Building H at the Oak Forest Campus;
however, they have recently been advised that Building H is on the demolition schedule for the next year. The
positions have been posted and staff are being hired. The type of phone system needed has been identified, so
that will move forward. This is an extension of two months that will allow the administration to bring the
system up.
With regard to request number 7, the subject of capital was discussed. Dr. John Jay Shannon, Chief Executive
Officer, noted that when staff moved into Stroger Hospital in December 2002, there was no capital
replacement plan. In response to a question from Mr. Scheer regarding whether a plan is now in place, he
responded in the negative; he stated that this will need to be done. An analysis by the System’s biomedical
engineering staff in 2013 estimated that there was approximately $80 million in technology-dependent
equipment that had been neglected over the years. He stated that there has been a significant catch up; with
FY2013, FY2014 and FY2015 purchases, this covers about $30 million of the estimated $80 million.
During the Committee’s discussion of the Group Purchasing Organization (GPO), Board Chairman Hammock
asked for further information on some of the other local GPO participants besides the System, and how a GPO
is measured in the Minority- and Women-Owned Business Enterprise (M/WBE) category. Mr. Elwell
responded that he will provide a list of local participants in this GPO1. With regard to the question on GPO
contracts and M/WBE, he indicated that when the GPO contracts are executed, they go through the same
Contract Compliance as non-GPO contracts.
With regard to request number 9, Mr. Elwell stated that it is very difficult to recruit psychiatrists; it is
particularly difficult to recruit them for Cermak Health Services. The administration has worked to try to
address the shortage using various resources, including locum tenens, telepsychiatry, and the System’s own
outpatient psychiatrists, but there is still a significant shortage. The administration hopes to eventually recruit
psychiatrists into Cermak, but none of the strategies to date have produced enough psychiatrists. The
Columbus Organization is a firm that specializes in this area; he acknowledged that the System is paying a
premium for these services. This contract covers the services of two (2) psychiatrists for one (1) year, and
includes benefits, relocation fees and everything needed to get them on site. The System needs to provide
good quality care and the administration is challenged to meet the needs. Dr. Shannon added that the
Department of Justice monitors will be arriving for their semi-annual visit in April; this subject continues to be
a pressure point and a high degree of focus for them. With regard to the subject of recruitment, Director Junge
suggested that the administration should perhaps talk with the unions regarding loan forgiveness as an
incentive for recruitment. On the subject of loan forgiveness as it relates to the National Health Service Corps
(NHS) program, Dr. Shannon provided an update. He stated that he met with the delegation in Washington
DC recently, and he believes that United States Senator Richard Durbin is going to be introducing a bill to
qualify Cermak for that program; this is in conjunction with other counties that have large county- or city-level
jails. He added that he will explore the subject of working with the unions, too, as suggested by Director
Junge.

III. Action Items
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)
Director Butler, seconded by Director Wiese, moved the approval of request numbers
1 through 18, subject to completion of review by Contract Compliance where
appropriate. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
Note: there were no requests that remained pending at the March 27, 2015 Meeting of the CCHHS Board of
Directors.
C. Any items listed under Section III

IV. Report from the Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Finance and Strategy (Attachment #2)
A. Financial Statements (Attachment #3)
B. Metrics (Attachment #4)
C. Report of emergency purchases
Mr. Elwell provided an overview of the Report, Financial Statements and Metrics. The Committee reviewed
and discussed the information.
During the discussion of the Report, Mr. Scheer requested that some time be spent at the April meeting to
discuss the external factors and key issues that relate to the State’s 2016 Budget.
During the discussion of the Metrics, Director Gugenheim inquired regarding the number of staffed beds at
Stroger Hospital. Dr. Shannon responded that, of the 464 licensed beds in the hospital, which includes all the
ICU beds, the census is typically in the 250-275 range. Mr. Elwell stated that the challenge now is to go out
and capture greater market share to keep the census where it is; he noted that this is a national trend. Board
Chairman Hammock stated that it would be helpful to get to the next level of metrics at the ambulatory level to
understand how the System compares to others.
There were no emergency purchases to report at this time.

D. Strategic Issue Review (Attachment #5)
i. CountyCare Update
Steven Glass, Executive Director of Managed Care, provided an overview of the information contained in the
CountyCare Update. The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
Director Butler, seconded by Director Wiese, moved to receive and file the reports
under Section IV. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
