CONGRATULATING THE CHICAGO LIGHTHOUSE FOR THE BLIND
ON ITS 110TH ANNIVERSARY
WHEREAS, founded in 1906 on Chicago’s West Side, the Chicago Lighthouse for the Blind has been a
pioneer in innovation across the areas of vision care, rehabilitation, education, employment and technology
for 110 years; and
WHEREAS, since its inception, Chicago Lighthouse activities have included collecting donated food and
clothing from area women’s clubs, as well as teaching employable skills like weaving and carpentry for
permanent job attainment; and
WHEREAS, the Chicago Lighthouse has remained diligent and dedicated through two (2) world wars and
the worst economic depression in history. The organization continues to provide opportunities for
employment, empowerment and independence to individuals facing life with vision loss; and
WHEREAS, over several decades, the Lighthouse’s mission has grown to include clinical vision care, with
the establishment of the first low vision rehabilitation clinic in the Midwest. In 1955, the Lighthouse opened
the doors of a facility in Chicago’s Medical District, dedicated by the world-renowned advocate for the
deaf and the blind, Helen Keller; and
WHEREAS, the Lighthouse earned an exclusive clock manufacturing contract from the federal
government in the late 1970s and, over the next two (2) decades, saw the facility double in size and expand
its services to a North Shore satellite location, marking the beginning of a growing regional footprint; and
WHEREAS, former Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley called the Lighthouse one of the most
“comprehensive social service agencies in the United States,” given the diversity of programs and
beneficiaries of Lighthouse services; and
WHEREAS, today, the Chicago Lighthouse serves more than 67,000 people each year, and remains
committed to growing that impact by expanding critical programs, forging collaborative partnerships, and
creatively approaching the challenges that individuals with visual impairments face daily.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the President and Cook County Board of Commissioners,
that the Chicago Lighthouse for the Blind is to be congratulated, and that the sincere appreciation of the
President and the Cook County Board of Commissioners is to be extended to the Chicago Lighthouse for
the Blind for its service to the region over a period of 110 years.

RECOGNIZING MAY 22, 2016 AS “STOP THE STIGMA SUNDAY”
WHEREAS, in 2013 President Barack Obama proclaimed May to be National Mental Health Awareness
Month; and
WHEREAS, in 2011 Illinois made greater reductions in state funding for mental health than any other state
in the United States of America; and
WHEREAS, the current round of state budget negotiations in Springfield indicates that Illinois is on track
to continue its status as one of the poorest funders of mental health services in the nation; and
WHEREAS, according to Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart, the reduction in funding for mental health
services across multiple levels of government, has resulted in the Cook County Jail being the largest mental
health facility in the state and possibly the nation; and
WHEREAS, according to a joint report authored by the Mental Health Movement of Chicago and
AFSCME Council 31, Chicago’s closure of half of its mental health clinics in April of 2012 resulted in a
failure by the City of Chicago to account for hundreds and perhaps thousands of people who had depended
on these clinics for mental health treatment services; and
WHEREAS, that same report, entitled “Abandoning the Most Vulnerable,” cites a complete lack of a
comprehensive effort to determine how many people lost access to mental health treatment services after
the Chicago clinic closures and similar lack of effort to make contact with the individuals who lost access
to treatment and connect them with new service providers; and

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

May 11, 2016

WHEREAS, Cook County, which is charged with providing services to the most vulnerable members of
our local population, deals every day with the consequences of an inadequate safety net that has stranded
too many of our residents without access to care that they urgently need; and
WHEREAS, we count among those consequences an overcrowded jail, court system and Juvenile
Temporary Detention Center, all of which constitute a significant drain on Cook County’s budget and
resources; and
WHEREAS, in addition to funding barriers, the stigma associated with having a mental illness has
prevented many people from receiving the treatment they require; and
WHEREAS, churches across Cook County will be hosting a program called “Stop the Stigma Sunday” on
Sunday, May 22, 2016; and
WHEREAS, in recognition of “Stop the Stigma Sunday,” clergy and church leaders will feature in their
sermons and Sunday programs a segment on mental health destigmatization; and
WHEREAS, as part of “Stop the Stigma Sunday,” materials will be provided to clergy and church
leadership to assist them in crafting their presentations to their congregations; and
WHEREAS, as it is good, fitting and appropriate that Cook County government should lend its support to
such a critical initiative that addresses such an important public policy challenge.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County President and the Board of
Commissioners recognize May 22, 2016 as “Stop the Stigma Sunday”; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County President and the Board of Commissioners express
their support and appreciation to the men and women of faith, as well as those community activists and
leaders who will take the time on May 22, 2016 to raise awareness and combat the stigma that all too often
surrounds mental health issues in Cook County and beyond.
Approved and adopted this 11th of May 2016.

CALLING FOR THE MONTH OF MAY TO BE DECLARED
“CURFEW AWARENESS MONTH”
WHEREAS, it is well known that the strict enforcement of curfew laws in Chicago and other municipalities
in Cook County is a key component of a public safety and law enforcement strategy that is effective; and
WHEREAS, in the City of Chicago, minors under the age of 12 are required to be in their homes by 8:30
P.M. on weekdays and 9 P.M. on weekends; and
WHEREAS, in the City of Chicago, unsupervised minors ages 12 to 16 are required to be indoors by 10
P.M. on weekdays and 11 P.M. on weekends; and
WHEREAS, the State of Illinois, in its Child Curfew Act codified in 107 ILCS 55/.10 et seq. grants specific
legislative or regulatory authority for child curfew restrictions, thereby empowering municipalities in the
County of Cook to enact curfews of their own; and
WHEREAS, too many of our young people in Chicago and Cook County are impacted by crimes during
hours of the day when those young people should be in their homes; and
WHEREAS, awareness and strict enforcement of curfew laws can lessen the impact of violent crime on
young people in Chicago and Cook County and also reduce incidences of violent crime in Chicago and
Cook County overall, particularly in the warm spring and summer months.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the President and Cook County Board of Commissioners
that May of 2016 is hereby declared “Curfew Awareness Month,” and that the President and the Cook
County Board of Commissioners do hereby lend their voices to the efforts of community advocates and
concerned citizens to increase awareness and enforcement of curfew laws.

ONWARD NEIGHBORHOOD HOUSE - CELEBRATING 8 YEARS OF SERVICE TO
NORTHWEST COMMUNITIES
WHEREAS, Onward Neighborhood House was established in 1926 as a community center serving the
near northwest neighborhoods of Chicago, by a group of volunteers from the Glencoe Union Church and
the Winnetka Congregational Church. It was named after the Onward Presbyterian Church, which served
as its first home. Onward House formed clubs for its participants, including special interest and age-group
clubs. They sponsored and housed numerous neighborhood activities as its staff helped acclimating
residents find interpreters, referrals to city agencies and first aid. As the programs expanded so too did its
need for new facilities. In 1928, the Chicago Congregational Union, together with Presbyterian Extension
Board, provided the funds for a new building located at 600 North Leavitt; and
WHEREAS, prior to the 1920s, the idea of social service often referred to charity or relief, typically in the
form of legal aid, immigrant assistance and traveler’s aid. Most hardships up to then-both social and
economic- had to be met by family and local efforts. The Great Depression (1930-1941), altered the social
and physical needs of clients that pushed Onward House to focus on providing food, clothing and fuel as
well as stress counseling. At this time, the agency served 130,000 annually through its education, youth and
family support programs. On December 7, 1943, Onward Neighborhood House was officially incorporated
as a not-for-profit organization “to maintain and conduct an organization to minister to the spiritual, moral,
mental and physical needs of the community”; and
WHEREAS, fast forwarding to the early 2000’s, Onward House acknowledged the need for proper
technology training in a post-industrial economy, implicated by a digital divide in computer fluency among
higher income and lower income populations, Onward House established its Community Computer
Resource Center (CCRC) in 2000. On May 28, 2008, due to the displaced residents from newly gentrified
areas and razed public housing, Onward House and its Board of Directors, sought out a new facility located
at 5423 West Diversey Avenue in the Belmont Cragin area; and
WHEREAS, continuing to serve families in the West Town and Belmont Cragin communities, Onward
Neighborhood House continues to empower thousands of families and individuals seeking to achieve their
full potential in a community-based setting through participant-driven educational, recreational and social
service programs. Onward House remains true to their mission through their early childhood, school age,
family support, food pantry, computer center, partnership program and adult education programs. Onward
House continues to be a pillar of hope, guidance and development.

REGARDING THE CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE
TO CONDUCT AN ADVICE AND CONSENT HEARING
ON THE PRESIDENT’S NOMINATION OF JUDGE MERRICK GARLAND
TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
WHEREAS, the Supreme Court, in its capacity as the highest federal court in the United States, serves an
essential function resolving critical questions of law that affect our community, our economy, and all
citizens; and
WHEREAS, the Constitution of the United States provides that the Senate shall provide Advice and
Consent for appointments to the Supreme Court of the United States; and
WHEREAS, the Supreme Court vacancy caused by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia occurred on
February 13, 2016, 269 days before the 2016 presidential election; and
WHEREAS, the Senate has confirmed more than a dozen Supreme Court justices in presidential election
years, including five in the last 100 years; and
WHEREAS, the Senate’s constitutional duty to advise and consent on judicial nominees is one of its most
important and solemn responsibilities; and
Page 28 of 319

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

May 11, 2016

WHEREAS, the Senate Judiciary Committee has never denied a Supreme Court nominee a hearing since
it began holding public confirmation hearings; and
WHEREAS, if the Senate refuses to consider a Supreme Court nominee until after the next President is
sworn into office, it will result in the longest Supreme Court vacancy since the Civil War; and
WHEREAS, every Supreme Court nominee who was not withdrawn by the President has received a vote
by the Senate within 125 days of the nomination announcement; and
WHEREAS, since 1975, the average number of days from nomination to confirmation vote for a Supreme
Court nominee has been 70 days; and
WHEREAS, forcing the Supreme Court to function with only eight justices risks creating instances in
which the Court is evenly divided on the outcome of a case, preventing the Court from resolving conflicting
interpretations of the Constitution among different regions of the Nation and thereby undermining the
Supreme Court’s role as the final arbiter of the law; and
WHEREAS, President Obama has nominated Merrick Garland, Chief Judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia Circuit, who has an established track record of building consensus as a
thoughtful, fair-minded judge who follows the law.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Senate should perform its constitutional duty to
provide advice and consent on the President’s Supreme Court nominee by:
1)

Promptly scheduling a hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee for Judge Merrick
Garland, so that he can be considered on his merits in an open and transparent manner; and

2)

Holding a confirmation vote on the Senate floor, with opportunity for debate on Judge
Merrick Garland’s nomination; and

3)

Working on behalf of the people of the United States to ensure that the vacancy on the
Supreme Court is filled without undue and unnecessary delay so that the Supreme Court
can effectively serve its essential constitutional function as the final arbiter of the law.

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that suitable copies of this Resolution be sent to Senate Majority Leader
Mitch McConnell, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, Senator Richard Durbin, and Senator Mark Kirk.

WHEREAS, an aspect of that legislation will raise the taxes on motor fuel by $0.04 per gallon; and
WHEREAS, the tax is expected to generate roughly $50,000,000.00 in additional revenues; and
WHEREAS, the proceeds of this tax shall be reserved, in large part, for the use of the Cook County Jobs
Council for the purpose of providing meaningful employment opportunities and employment training to
Cook County residents between the ages of 16 and 24; and
WHEREAS, stabilizing communities and reducing violence in the most vulnerable neighborhoods of
Cook County are critically important endeavors, requiring sacrifice from all residents of Cook County;
and
WHEREAS, residents of Cook County, too often, feel disconnected from the elected officials who serve
them; and
WHEREAS, elected officials should make a concerted effort to be an example for the communities who
have placed them in a position of power and responsibility; and
WHEREAS, the members of this Board of Commissioners and the President of the Cook County Board
receive generous salaries paid for from the tax dollars of the County; and
WHEREAS, in many instances, the salaries that the members of the Board of Commissioners receive are
not the sole source of income for the members; and
WHEREAS, the salaries that the members of the Cook County Board of Commissioners receive are
substantially greater than the median per capita income of Cook County which is $30,048.00 per year;
and
WHEREAS, the senior citizens of Cook County did not receive a Cost of Living Adjustment in their
Social Security Benefits for Fiscal Year 2016; and
WHEREAS, the principle of shared sacrifice and the mandate to “do more with less” should apply not
just to the citizens of Cook County, but to the elected officials that represent them; and
WHEREAS, shared sacrifice in deed rather than in word will do much to strengthen the trust between
the elected officials of Cook County and the people of Cook County.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and Cook County Board of
Commissioners do hereby support reducing their own salaries by $10,000.00 per annum for the purpose
of funding public works projects and creating meaningful jobs for the residents of Cook County who are
affected by high unemployment;
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, the President intends to recommend the appropriation of the funds
saved by virtue of the aforementioned reductions in salary be especially dedicated to funding of
employment opportunities for residents of Cook County aged 16-24.

COUNTY COMMISSIONERS
SUPPORT FOR ILLINOIS GENERAL ASSEMBLY HOUSE BILL 4633 AND
CONDEMNATION OF LIFE INSURERS WHO REFUSE TO FIND BENEFICIARIES OF
UNCLAIMED BENEFITS
WHEREAS, the 99th General Assembly of the State of Illinois has recently considered House Bill 4633;
and
WHEREAS, House Bill 4633 will create the Unclaimed Life Insurance Benefits Act; and
WHEREAS, the Act will require all authorized insurers regulated by the Illinois Department of Insurance
to undertake good faith efforts to locate beneficiaries and make payment funds owed to those beneficiaries;
and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners is entrusted with the responsibility for the welfare
of the residents of Cook County; and
WHEREAS, United States Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL) has recently called upon Cook County-based
insurance company, Kemper Corp. to disavow the practice of withholding unclaimed beneficiary funds;
and
WHEREAS, Kemper Corp, an insurer with several subsidiaries, headquartered in Cook County, has $8
billion dollars in assets; and
WHEREAS, Kemper Corp. and its subsidiaries hold billions of dollars in unclaimed benefits; and
WHEREAS, Kemper Corp. and its subsidiaries profit and bolster their bottom line by intentionally

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

withholding beneficiaries’ rightful funds; and
WHEREAS, at the same time that many of the residents of Cook County experience financial hardships as
a result of the death of loved ones, Kemper Corp. and other Insurers record massive profits; and
WHEREAS, the State of Illinois and 40 other states have recently filed suit against insurers to force them
to allow an audit; and
WHEREAS, Kemper Corp. has filed suit to stop Illinois from auditing its records of unclaimed benefit
payments; and
WHEREAS, the corporate entities of Cook County should hold themselves to the highest standards of
ethics, decency, and good corporate citizenship; and
WHEREAS, withholding unclaimed funds and making no efforts to locate beneficiaries, as well as
obstructing efforts to require compliance with Illinois law fall far short of these standards; and
WHEREAS, the practices of not locating or notifying beneficiaries and denying beneficiaries with a
rightful claim to life insurance proceeds could amount to the tortious act of conversion; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board will not sit silently while a corporate citizen of Cook County
perpetrates such harm on the residents of Cook County.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and Cook County Board of Commissioners
do hereby support and encourage the 99th General Assembly of the State of Illinois in the passage of House
Bill 4633 and strongly encourage Governor Rauner to sign such legislation into law; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the President and the Cook County Board of Commissioners
strongly encourage Kemper Corp. and its subsidiaries to dismiss its suit against the State of Illinois and
fully submit to the State’s effort to audit their policy records; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the President and the Cook County Board of Commissioners
condemn in the strongest terms, the actions of life insurers who sell policies to the residents of Cook County
and have willfully and wantonly withheld payment of claims and refused to find and notify beneficiaries.
Approved and adopted this 11th of May 2016.

Summary: In 2013, Cook County leveraged pricing discounts available to volume purchasers by
aggregating its technology needs with the City of Chicago. A joint City-County RFP was issued and
representatives from both government entities recommended that CDW Government LLC be awarded.
The contract allows County agencies to procure necessary software and equipment through an online
ordering system.
This Board subsequently approved a contract increase in 2015 to facilitate grant-funded purchases by the
Department of Homeland Security, and additional purchases for other offices under the President and
separately elected officials. The contract increase was accompanied by a corresponding amendment to
reduce the mark-up cost for any newly added software items.
The Bureau of Technology now respectfully requests Board approval of an increase and extension to the
contract to allow County agencies to continue to procure necessary software and equipment while a
corresponding RFP process is completed.
This contract was awarded through a competitive Request for Proposal (RFP) process in accordance with
the Cook County Procurement Code. CDW Government was awarded based on established evaluation
criteria.

MEETING OF MAY 10, 2016

ORDINANCE
Sponsored by
THE HONORABLE JOHN A. FRITCHEY AND LUIS ARROYO JR,
COUNTY COMMISSIONERS
COOK COUNTY ANIMAL ABUSER REGISTRY
WHEREAS, the State of Illinois and the County of Cook have criminalized abuse and cruelty towards
animals; and
WHEREAS, despite these laws against animal cruelty and abuse, animal cruelty continues to be a problem
in Illinois and Cook County; and
Page 109 of 319

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

May 11, 2016

WHEREAS, the number of cruelty cases reported daily on various media sources is not reflective of the
actual number of cases, as most cases are never reported, and most animal suffering goes unrecognized and
unabated; and
WHEREAS, further complicating this issue is the fact that, unlike violent crimes against people,
information on reported cases of animal abuse have not been compiled by state and federal agencies, making
it difficult to calculate the prevalence or trends in these crimes; and
WHEREAS, intentional cruelty to animals is strongly correlated with other crimes, including violence
against people, and data on domestic violence and child abuse cases reveal that a staggering number of
animals are victimized by abusive parents or partners each year; and
WHEREAS, in light of the above-mentioned link between animal abuse and crimes against people,
including violent crimes and domestic violence, after a years-long lobbying effort and the backing of the
National Sheriffs Association and the Animal Welfare Institute, in 2014, the FBI agreed to elevate animal
cruelty to its own separate offense category defined as “Intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly taking an
action that mistreats or kills any animal without just cause, such as torturing, tormenting, mutilation,
maiming, poisoning, or abandonment.”; and
WHEREAS, 2016 marks the first time the FBI will collect data on animal crimes the way it does for other
serious crimes such as homicide or rape by having their own organized category within the National
Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS), the FBI’s public collection of national crime statistics; and
WHEREAS, the goal is that after several years of collecting statistics other law enforcement agencies will
be able to see trends that will allow them to better allocate their resources to catching animal abusers and
in the process hopefully better protect both animals and people; and
WHEREAS, it is in the best interest of the residents of Cook County and their animals that an online
registry be established identifying individuals residing in Cook County convicted of animal abuse crimes
that will prevent these individuals from adopting, purchasing, or otherwise obtaining animals from any
animal shelter, pet seller, or other person or entity involved in the exchange of animals by adoption, sale,
or other means.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that Chapter
46 Law Enforcement, Article II Sheriff, Division I, Sections 46-38 through 46-45 of the Cook County Code,
is hereby enacted as follows:

ORDINANCE
Sponsored by
THE HONORABLE TONI PRECKWINKLE,
PRESIDENT OF THE COOK COUNTY BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS
WHEREAS, Section 6(a) of Article VII of the 1970 Constitution of the State of Illinois provides that “a
County which has a Chief Executive Officer elected by the electors of the County ... (is) a Home Rule Unit”
and The County of Cook, Illinois (the “County”), has a Chief Executive Officer elected by the electors of
the County and is therefore a Home Rule Unit and may, under the power granted by said Section 6(a) of
Article VII of the Constitution of 1970, as supplemented by the Local Government Debt Reform Act of the
State of Illinois, as amended (the “Debt Reform Act”), and the other Omnibus Bond Acts, as amended,
exercise any power and perform any function pertaining to its government and affairs, including, but not
limited to, the power to tax and to incur debt; and
WHEREAS, the County has the power to incur debt payable from ad valorem property tax receipts or from
any other lawful source and maturing within 40 years from the time it is incurred without prior referendum
approval; and
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of the County (the “Corporate Authorities”) has not adopted
any Ordinance, resolution, order or motion or provided any County Code provisions which restrict or limit
the exercise of the home rule powers of the County in the issuance of general obligation bonds without
referendum for corporate purposes or which provides any special rules or procedures for the exercise of
such power; and
WHEREAS, the County has heretofore issued and there are now outstanding various series of general
obligation bonds (collectively, the “Prior Bonds”), including General Obligation Refunding Bonds, Series
2006A (the “2006A Bonds”); and

Page 163 of 319

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

May 11, 2016

WHEREAS, the 2006A Bonds are now outstanding in the aggregate principal amount of $333,680,000,
mature and are subject to optional redemption on the dates and as provided in the Ordinances adopted by
the Corporate Authorities on the 19th day of September, 2002, and on the 5th day of January, 2005,
authorizing the issuance of the 2006A Bonds; and
WHEREAS, it is in the best interests of the County and its citizens and is necessary for the government
and affairs of the County to authorize the refunding (the “Refunding”) from time to time of all or a portion
of the Prior Bonds, including the 2006A Bonds, or of all or any portion of any installment of interest coming
due thereon, all as may be advisable from time to time in order to achieve debt service savings for the
County or to restructure the debt service burden on the County; and
WHEREAS, the aggregate costs of the Refunding, including consulting, financial advisory, legal services,
underwriters’ discount, trustee and other financial fees as shall be necessary, are far less than the anticipated
savings to be generated from the Refunding; and
WHEREAS, the Corporate Authorities accordingly do hereby determine that it is advisable and in the best
interests of the County to borrow from time to time for the purpose of the Refunding, and to pay costs of
issuance, and, in evidence of such borrowing, to issue one or more series of full faith and credit bonds of
the County as hereinafter authorized.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the Board of Commissioners of The County of Cook,
Illinois, as follows:

The Corporate Authorities hereby find that it is necessary and in the best interests of the County,
its residents and taxpayers that the County provide for the Refunding; that the Refunding is expressly
authorized under the Act; and that the Bonds be issued to enable the County to pay the costs of the
Refunding. The Corporate Authorities hereby find that all of the recitals contained in the preambles to this
Ordinance are full, true and correct and do hereby incorporate them into this Ordinance by this reference.
It is hereby found and determined that the Corporate Authorities are authorized by law to borrow upon the
credit of the County and as evidence of such indebtedness to issue at this time one or more Series of Bonds
to pay the costs of the Refunding. It is hereby found and determined that such borrowing of money pertains
to the government and affairs of the County, is necessary or advisable for the welfare of the government
and affairs of the County, is for a proper public purpose or purposes and is in the public interest, and is
authorized pursuant to the Act; and these findings and determinations shall be deemed conclusive. The
authority to issue the Bonds is the Act, and the Bonds shall be issued pursuant to the Act.
Sec. 3.Bond Details.
To pay the costs of the Refunding, the Bonds shall be issued from time to time in one or more
Series, all as may be determined by the Chief Financial Officer, provided that the aggregate principal
amount of any Bonds issued pursuant to this Ordinance shall not exceed $375,000,000. The Bonds shall be
designated substantially as “General Obligation Refunding Bonds, Series 2016,” with such additions or
modifications as shall be determined to be necessary by the Chief Financial Officer at the time of the sale
of the Bonds.
Each Series of Bonds shall be dated as of June 1, 2016, or such later date at or prior to the date of issuance
thereof as may be provided in the relevant Bond Order (any such date for any Bonds being a “Dated Date”);
provided that no Bond shall be dated later than December 31, 2016.
All Bonds (i) shall also bear the date of authentication, (ii) shall be in fully registered form, (iii)
shall be issued in Book Entry Form, (iv) shall be in Authorized Denominations as provided in the relevant
Bond Order (but no single Bond shall represent installments of principal maturing on more than one date),
(v) shall be numbered 1 and upward within each Series, (vi) shall bear interest at the rates percent per annum
and (vii) shall mature serially or as Term Bonds (subject as hereinafter provided with respect to prior
redemption) on November 15 (or such other date or dates as may be provided in the relevant Bond Order)
of the years and in the amounts, as provided in the relevant Bond Order, subject to the limitations set forth
below.
All Bonds shall become due and payable as provided in the relevant Bond Order, provided,
however, that no Bond shall have a Stated Maturity which is later than the date which is thirty (30) years
after its Dated Date.
The Bonds shall bear interest at a rate or rates percent per annum not to exceed seven percent (7.0%)
per annum. The Bonds shall bear interest at the rate or rates percent per annum as provided in the relevant
Bond Order.
Each Bond shall bear interest from the later of its Dated Date or the most recent interest payment
date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, until the principal amount of such Bond is paid,
such interest (computed upon the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months) being payable, subject
Page 170 of 319

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

May 11, 2016

to the provisions of any Bond Order, on each May 15 and November 15, commencing on such May 15 or
November 15 as determined by the Chief Financial Officer in the Bond Order therefor.
So long as the Bonds are held in Book Entry Form, interest on each Bond shall be paid to the
Depository by check or draft or electronic funds transfer, in lawful money of the United States of America,
as may be agreed in the Representations Letter; in the event the Bonds should ever become available in
physical form to registered owners other than the Depository, interest on each Bond shall be paid by check
or draft of the Trustee, payable upon presentation thereof in lawful money of the United States of America,
or by electronic funds transfer of lawful money of the United States of America, as may be provided, to the
person in whose name such Bond is registered at the close of business on the applicable Regular Record
Date, and mailed to the address or transferred to such account of such registered owner as it appears on the
Bond Register or at such other address or account as may be furnished in writing to the Trustee.
Principal of and premium (if any) on each Bond shall be paid upon surrender in lawful money of
the United States of America, at the principal office maintained for the purpose by the Trustee or its proper
agent.
The Bonds shall have impressed or imprinted thereon the corporate seal or facsimile thereof of the County
and shall be signed by the manual or duly authorized facsimile signatures of the President and County Clerk,
as they shall determine, and in case any officer whose signature shall appear on any Bond shall cease to be
such officer before the delivery of such Bond, such signature shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for
all purposes, the same as if such officer had remained in office until delivery.
All Bonds shall have thereon a certificate of authentication substantially in the form hereinafter set
forth duly executed by the Trustee as authenticating agent of the County and showing the date of
authentication. No Bond shall be valid or obligatory for any purpose or be entitled to any security or benefit
under this Ordinance unless and until such certificate of authentication shall have been duly executed by
the Trustee by manual signature, and such certificate of authentication upon any such Bond shall be
conclusive evidence that such Bond has been authenticated and delivered under this Ordinance. The
certificate of authentication on any Bond shall be deemed to have been executed by the Trustee if signed
by an authorized officer of the Trustee, but it shall not be necessary that the same officer sign the certificate
of authentication on all of the Bonds issued hereunder.
Sec. 4.Book-Entry Provisions.
The Bonds shall be initially issued in the form of a separate single fully registered Bond for each
of the maturities of each Series of the Bonds. Upon initial issuance, the ownership of each such Bond shall
be registered in the Bond Register in such name as may be provided by the Depository (the “Book Entry
Owner”) and, accordingly, in Book Entry Form as provided and defined herein. Any Designated Officer is
authorized to execute a Representations Letter or to utilize the provisions of an existing Representations
Letter. Without limiting the generality of the authority given with respect to entering into the
Representations Letter for the Bonds, it may contain provisions relating to (i) payment procedures, (ii)
transfers of the Bonds or of beneficial interests therein, (iii) redemption notices and procedures unique to
the Depository, (iv) additional notices or communications, and (v) amendment from time to time to conform
with changing customs and practices with respect to securities industry transfer and payment practices.
With respect to Bonds registered in the Bond Register in the name of the Book Entry Owner, neither the
County nor the Trustee shall have any responsibility or obligation to any broker-dealer, bank, or other
Page 171 of 319

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

May 11, 2016

financial institution for which the Depository holds Bonds from time to time as securities depository (each
such broker-dealer, bank, or other financial institution being referred to herein as a “Depository
Participant”) or to any person on behalf of whom such a Depository Participant holds an interest in the
Bonds. Without limiting the meaning of the immediately preceding sentence, neither the County nor the
Trustee shall have any responsibility or obligation with respect to (a) the accuracy of the records of the
Depository, the Book Entry Owner, or any Depository Participant with respect to any ownership interest in
the Bonds; (b) the delivery to any Depository Participant or any other person, other than a registered owner
of a Bond as shown in the Bond Register or as expressly provided in the Representations Letter, of any
notice with respect to the Bonds, including any notice of redemption; or (c) the payment to any Depository
Participant or any other person, other than a registered owner of a Bond as shown in the Bond Register, of
any amount with respect to principal of or interest on the Bonds. No person other than a registered owner
of a Bond as shown in the Bond Register shall receive a Bond certificate with respect to any Bond. In the
event that (x) the County determines that the Depository is incapable of discharging its responsibilities
described herein or in the Representations Letter, (y) the agreement among the County and the Depository
evidenced by the Representations Letter shall be terminated for any reason, or (z) the County determines
that it is in the best interests of the County or of the beneficial owners of the Bonds that they be able to
obtain certificated Bonds; the County shall notify the Depository of the availability of Bond certificates,
and the Bonds shall no longer be restricted to being registered in the Bond Register to the Book Entry
Owner. The County may determine at such time that the Bonds shall be registered in the name of and
deposited with a successor depository operating a book entry only system, as may be acceptable to the
County, or such depository’s agent or designee, but if the County does not select such successor depository,
then the Bonds shall be registered in whatever name or names registered owners of Bonds transferring or
exchanging Bonds shall designate, in accordance with the provisions hereof.
Sec. 5.Redemption.
A. MANDATORY REDEMPTION. If so provided in the relevant Bond Order, any Bonds may be
issued as Term Bonds and be subject to mandatory redemption by operation of the Bond Fund at a price of
par, without premium, plus accrued interest to the date fixed for redemption, on November 15 (or such
other date or dates as may be provided in the relevant Bond Order) of the years and in the amounts and
subject to such provisions as shall be set forth in the relevant Bond Order. The County covenants that it will
redeem Term Bonds pursuant to the mandatory redemption requirement for such Term Bonds and provide
Pledged Taxes accordingly.
In connection with any mandatory redemption of Bonds as authorized above, the principal amounts
of such Bonds to be mandatorily redeemed in each year may be reduced through the earlier optional
redemption thereof, with any partial optional redemptions of such Bonds credited against future mandatory
redemption requirements in such order of the mandatory redemption dates as the Chief Financial Officer
may determine. In the absence of such determination, partial optional redemptions of such Bonds shall be
credited against future mandatory redemption requirements in inverse chronological order of such payments
beginning with the amount scheduled to become due at Stated Maturity, then the amount subject to
mandatory redemption on the redemption date immediately preceding Stated Maturity, and so on. In
addition, on or prior to the sixtieth (60th) day preceding any mandatory redemption date, the Trustee may,
and if directed by the Chief Financial Officer shall, purchase Bonds of such maturities in an amount not
exceeding the amount of such Bonds required to be retired on such mandatory redemption date and at a
price not exceeding par plus accrued interest. Any such Bonds so purchased shall be cancelled and the

Page 172 of 319

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

May 11, 2016

principal amount thereof shall be credited against the payment required on such next mandatory redemption
date.
The County shall provide the Trustee with written notice of such reduction, which notice shall be
given within thirty (30) days after such redemption or purchase, and the Trustee shall promptly give written
notice of the same to the Bondholders, in the manner hereinafter provided.
B. OPTIONAL REDEMPTION. If so provided in the relevant Bond Order, any Bonds may be
redeemable prior to maturity at the option of the County, in whole or in part on any date, at such times and
at such optional redemption prices, including any make-whole optional redemption prices, as shall be
determined by the Chief Financial Officer at the time of the sale thereof. Such optional redemption prices,
other than for any make-whole optional redemption, shall be expressed as a percentage of the principal
amount of Bonds to be redeemed, provided that such percentage shall not exceed one hundred three percent
(103.00%), plus accrued interest to the date of redemption. Optional redemption prices and other provisions
related to any make-whole optional redemption with respect to any Bonds shall be determined by the Chief
Financial Officer at the time of the sale thereof.
If less than all of the Outstanding Bonds of a Series are to be optionally redeemed, the Bonds to be called
shall be called from such Series, in such principal amounts and from such maturities as may be determined
by the County and within any maturity in the manner hereinafter provided.
C. REDEMPTION PROCEDURE. The Bonds subject to redemption shall be identified, notice
given, and paid and redeemed pursuant to the procedures as follows.
1.Redemption Notice. For a mandatory redemption of Term Bonds, unless otherwise notified by
the County, the Trustee shall proceed to redeem the Term Bonds without any further order or direction from
the County hereunder or otherwise. For an optional redemption, the County shall, at least forty-five (45)
days prior to any optional redemption date (unless a shorter time period shall be satisfactory to the Trustee),
notify the Trustee of such redemption date and of the principal amount and maturities of Bonds to be
redeemed.
2.Selection of Bonds within a Maturity. The Bonds shall be redeemed only in the principal amount
of $5,000 each and integral multiples thereof. For purposes of any redemption of less than all of the Bonds
of a single maturity, the particular Bonds or portions of Bonds to be redeemed shall be selected by lot by
the Trustee for the Bonds of such maturity by such method of lottery as the Trustee shall deem fair and
appropriate; provided, that such lottery shall provide for the selection for redemption of Bonds or portions
thereof so that each $5,000 principal amount of such Bond shall be as likely to be called for redemption as
any other such $5,000 Bond or $5,000 portion. The Trustee shall make such selection (a) upon or prior to
the time of the giving of official notice of redemption, or (b) in the event of a refunding or defeasance, upon
advice from the County that certain Bonds have been refunded or defeased and are no longer Outstanding
as defined.
Alternatively, if so provided in the relevant Bond Order, for purposes of any redemption of less than all of
the Bonds of a single maturity, the particular Bonds or portions of Bonds to be redeemed shall be selected
by the Trustee pro rata based upon a fraction the numerator of which is the principal amount of Bonds to
be redeemed on a given date and the denominator of which is the aggregate principal amount of such Series
of Bonds and of the given Stated Maturity remaining unpaid immediately prior to such redemption. If the
Bonds are held in Book Entry Form at the time of such redemption, the County shall direct the Trustee to
instruct the Depository to select the specific Bonds within such maturity for redemption pro rata among
Page 173 of 319

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

May 11, 2016

such Bonds, which redemption may utilize the Depository’s current pro rata pass-through distribution of
principal procedure or similar or substituted procedure promulgated from time to time. If while in Book
Entry Form the Depository has no procedure for pro rata redemption, then such partial redemption shall be
accomplished by lot, as described above. The County and the Trustee shall have no responsibility or
obligation to insure that the Depository properly selects such Bonds for redemption.
3.Official Notice of Redemption. The Trustee shall promptly notify the County in writing of the
Bonds or portions of Bonds selected for redemption and, in the case of any Bond selected for partial
redemption, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. Unless waived by the registered owner of Bonds
to be redeemed, official notice of any such redemption shall be given by the Trustee on behalf of the County
by mailing the redemption notice by first class U.S. mail not less than thirty (30) days and not more than
sixty (60) days prior to the date fixed for redemption to each registered owner of the Bond or Bonds to be
redeemed at the address shown on the Bond Register or at such other address as is furnished in writing by
such registered owner to the Trustee. All official notices of redemption shall include the name of the Bonds
and at least the information as follows:
(a) the redemption date;
(b) the redemption price, or for any optional redemption utilizing a make-whole redemption
provision, a description of the formula by which the redemption price shall be determined;
(c) if less than all of the outstanding Bonds of a Series and of a particular maturity are to be
redeemed, the identification (and, in the case of partial redemption of Bonds of a Series within such
maturity, the respective principal amounts) of the Bonds to be redeemed;
(d) a statement that on the redemption date the redemption price will become due and payable upon
each such Bond or portion thereof called for redemption and that interest thereon shall cease to accrue from
and after said date; and
(e) the place where such Bonds are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price, which
place of payment shall be the office designated for that purpose by the Trustee.
4.Conditional Redemption. Unless moneys sufficient to pay the redemption price of the Bonds to
be redeemed shall have been received by the Trustee prior to the giving of such notice of redemption, such
notice may, at the option of the County, state that said redemption shall be conditional upon the receipt of
such moneys by the Trustee on or prior to the date fixed for redemption. If such moneys are not received,
such notice shall be of no force and effect, the County shall not redeem such Bonds, and the Trustee shall
give notice, in the same manner in which the notice of redemption was given, that such moneys were not
so received and that such Bonds will not be redeemed.
5.Bonds Shall Become Due. Official notice of redemption having been given as described, the
Bonds or portions of Bonds so to be redeemed shall, subject to the stated condition in paragraph 4.
immediately preceding, on the redemption date, become due and payable at the redemption price therein
specified, and from and after such date (unless the County shall default in the payment of the redemption
price) such Bonds or portions of Bonds shall cease to bear interest. Upon surrender of such Bonds for
redemption in accordance with said notice, such Bonds shall be paid by the Trustee at the redemption price.

The procedure for the payment of interest due as part of the redemption price shall be as herein provided
for payment of interest otherwise due.
6.Insufficiency in Notice Not Affecting Other Bonds; Failure to Receive Notice; Waiver. Neither
the failure to mail such redemption notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular
registered owner of a Bond, shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other registered
owners. Notice having been properly given, failure of a registered owner of a Bond to receive such notice
shall not be deemed to invalidate, limit or delay the effect of the notice or redemption action described in
the notice. Such notice may be waived in writing by a registered owner of a Bond entitled to receive such
notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of
notice by registered owners shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent
to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver. In lieu of the foregoing official notice, so
long as the Bonds are held in Book Entry Form, notice may be given as provided in the Representation
Letter, and the giving of such notice shall constitute a waiver by the Depository and the book entry owner,
as registered owner, of the foregoing notice. After giving proper notification of redemption to the Trustee,
as applicable, the County shall not be liable for any failure to give or defect in notice.
7.New Bond in Amount Not Redeemed. Upon surrender for any partial redemption of any Bond,
there shall be prepared for the registered owner a new Bond or Bonds of like Series and tenor, in Authorized
Denominations, of the same maturity, and bearing the same rate of interest in the amount of the unpaid
principal.
8.Effect of Nonpayment upon Redemption. If any Bond or portion of Bond called for redemption
shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, the principal shall, until paid, bear interest from
the redemption date at the rate borne by the Bond or portion of Bond so called for redemption.
9.Bonds to Be Cancelled; Payment to Identify Bonds. All Bonds which have been redeemed shall
be cancelled and destroyed by the Trustee and shall not be reissued. Upon the payment of the redemption
price of Bonds being redeemed, each check or other transfer of funds issued for such purpose shall bear the
CUSIP number identifying, by issue and maturity, the Bonds being redeemed with the proceeds of such
check or other transfer.
10.Additional Notice. The County agrees to provide such additional notice of redemption as it may
deem advisable at such time as it determines to redeem Bonds, taking into account any requirements or
guidance of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, the
Government Accounting Standards Board, or any other federal or state agency having jurisdiction or
authority in such matters; provided, however, that such additional notice shall be (a) advisory in nature, (b)
solely in the discretion of the County (unless a separate agreement shall be made), (c) not be a condition
precedent of a valid redemption or a part of the Bond contract, and (d) any failure or defect in such notice
shall not delay or invalidate the redemption of Bonds for which proper official notice shall have been given.
Reference is also made to the provisions of the Continuing Disclosure Undertaking of the County with
respect to the Bonds, which may contain other provisions relating to notice of redemption of Bonds.
11.Trustee to Advise County. As part of its duties hereunder, the Trustee shall prepare and forward
to the County a statement as to notices given with respect to each redemption together with copies of the
notices as mailed.

Sec. 6.Registration of Bonds; Persons Treated as Owners; Bonds Lost, Destroyed, Etc.
The County shall cause the Bond Register to be kept at the office maintained for the purpose by the
Trustee, which is hereby constituted and appointed the Registrar of the County. The County is authorized
to prepare, and the Trustee shall keep custody of, multiple Bond blanks executed by the County for use in
the transfer and exchange of Bonds.
Subject to the provisions hereof relating to the Bonds in Book Entry Form, any Bond may be
transferred or exchanged, but only in the manner, subject to the limitations of and upon payment of the
charges as set forth in this Ordinance. Upon surrender for transfer of any Bond at the office maintained for
the purpose by the Trustee, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of
transfer in form satisfactory to the Trustee and duly executed by, the registered owner or his or her attorney
duly authorized in writing, the County shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate, date and deliver in
the name of the transferee or transferees a new fully registered Bond or Bonds of the same Series of the
same tenor, of the same interest rate and Stated Maturity, of Authorized Denominations, for a like aggregate
principal amount. Subject to the provisions of this Ordinance relating to Book Entry Form any fully
registered Bond or Bonds may be exchanged at said office of the Trustee or its proper agent for a like
aggregate principal amount of such Bonds of the same tenor, of the same Series, interest rate and Stated
Maturity, of other Authorized Denominations.
The Trustee shall not be required to transfer or exchange any Bond during the period from the close
of business on the Regular Record Date for an interest payment to the opening of business on such interest
payment date or during the period of fifteen (15) days preceding the giving of notice of redemption of
Bonds or to transfer or exchange any Bond all or a portion of which has been called for redemption.
The execution by the County of any fully registered Bond shall constitute full and due authorization
of such Bond, and the Trustee or its proper agent shall thereby be authorized to authenticate, date and
deliver such Bond in accordance with the terms of this Ordinance; provided, however, the principal amount
of Bonds of each Series and maturity authenticated by the Trustee shall not at any one time exceed the
authorized principal amount of Bonds for such Series and maturity less the amount of such Bonds which
have been paid.
The person in whose name any Bond shall be registered shall be deemed and regarded as the
absolute owner thereof for all purposes, and payment of the principal of, premium (if any) or interest on
any Bond shall be made only to or upon the order of the registered owner thereof or his or her legal
representative. All such payments shall be valid and effectual to satisfy and discharge the liability upon
such Bond to the extent of the sum or sums so paid.
No service charge shall be made for any transfer or exchange of Bonds, but the County or the
Trustee may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may
be imposed in connection with any transfer or exchange of Bonds exchanged in the case of the issuance of
a Bond or Bonds for the outstanding portion of a Bond surrendered for redemption.
If any Bond, whether in temporary or definitive form, is lost (whether by reason of theft or
otherwise), destroyed (whether by mutilation, damage, in whole or in part, or otherwise) or improperly
Page 176 of 319

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

May 11, 2016

cancelled, the Trustee or its proper agent may authenticate a new Bond of like Series, date, maturity date,
interest rate, denomination and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding;
provided that
(a) in the case of any mutilated Bond, such mutilated Bond shall first be surrendered to the Trustee,
and
(b) in the case of any lost Bond or Bond destroyed in whole, there shall be first furnished to the
Trustee evidence of such loss or destruction, together with indemnification of the County and the Trustee,
satisfactory to the Trustee. In the event any lost, destroyed or improperly cancelled Bond shall have matured
or is about to mature, or has been called for redemption, instead of issuing a duplicate Bond, the Trustee
shall pay the same without surrender thereof if there shall be first furnished to the Trustee evidence of such
loss, destruction or cancellation, together with indemnity, satisfactory to it. Upon the issuance of any
substitute Bond, the Trustee may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other
governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto.
Sec. 7.Security.
The full faith and credit of the County are hereby irrevocably pledged to the punctual payment of
the principal of and interest on the Bonds. The Bonds shall be direct and general obligations of the County,
and the County shall be obligated and hereby covenants and agrees to levy ad valorem taxes upon all the
taxable property in the County for the payment of the Bonds and the interest thereon, without limitation as
to rate or amount. The County hereby pledges, as equal and ratable security for the Bonds, all present and
future proceeds of the Pledged Taxes on deposit or to be deposited in the Bond Fund for the sole benefit of
the registered owners of the Bonds, subject to the right, hereby expressly reserved by the County, to transfer
certain interest income or investment profit earned in the Bond Fund to other funds of the County.
Sec. 8.Forms of Bonds.
The Bonds shall be in substantially the forms hereinafter set forth; provided, however, that if the
text of the Bonds is to be printed in its entirety on the front side of the Bonds, then the second paragraph on
the front side and the legend “See Reverse Side for Additional Provisions” shall be omitted and the text of

in the amounts as shall be provided in each relevant Bond Order, which amounts, when aggregated with (i)
the receipts, if any, of taxes levied and collected for the payment of Refunded Bonds, (ii) any accrued

C.Covenants re Pledged Taxes. The County covenants and agrees with the purchasers and
registered owners of the Bonds that so long as any of the Bonds remain outstanding, the County will take
no action or fail to take any action which in any way would adversely affect the ability of the County to
levy and collect the Pledged Taxes. The County and its officers will comply with all present and future
applicable laws in order to assure that the Pledged Taxes may be levied, extended and collected as provided
herein and deposited into the Bond Fund.
D.Ordinance and Bond Orders to be Filed. A copy of this Ordinance, together with a subsequent
copy of each Bond Order, duly certified by the County Clerk, shall be filed in the office of the County
Clerk, and such filings shall constitute the authority for and it shall be the duty of said County Clerk, in

collection, such taxes to be in addition to and in excess of all other taxes heretofore or hereafter authorized
to be levied by the County on its behalf.
E.Abatement. Whenever and only when other funds from any lawful source are made available
for the purpose of paying any principal of and interest on the Bonds, so as to enable the abatement of the
Pledged Taxes levied herein for the payment of same, the Corporate Authorities shall, by proper
proceedings, direct the deposit of such funds into the Bond Fund and further shall direct the abatement of
the Pledged Taxes by the amount so deposited. A certified copy or other notification of any such

pledged as security for the payment of the Bonds. This pledge is made pursuant to Section 13 of the Debt
Reform Act to the fullest extent applicable and shall be valid and binding from the date of issuance of the
initial series of the Bonds. All such Pledged Taxes and the moneys held in the Bond Fund shall
immediately be subject to the lien of such pledge without any physical delivery or further act and the lien
of such pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract or
otherwise against the Country irrespective of whether such parties have notice thereof.
The Pledged Taxes and other moneys, securities and funds so pledged are and will be free and clear
of any pledge, lien, charge or encumbrance thereon or with respect thereto prior to, or of equal rank with,
the pledge created by this Ordinance. The County shall at all times, to the extent permitted by law, defend,
preserve and protect the pledge of the Pledged Taxes and other moneys, securities and funds pledged under
this Ordinance and all the rights thereto of the Bondholders under this Ordinance against all claims and
demands of all persons whomsoever.

owners as will allow the County to achieve debt service savings for the County, and the Designated Officers
are hereby authorized and directed to approve or execute, or both, such documents as may be necessary to
accomplish such purchase. The Senior Managers, Co-Senior Managers and Co-Managers listed in
Paragraph C of this Section 11, and any underwriting affiliates thereof, are hereby approved and confirmed
as dealer managers with respect to the purchase of any Prior Bonds with the proceeds of the Bonds.
Sec. 12.Creation of Funds and Appropriations; Abatement of Taxes Levied for Refunded Bonds.
A.Bond Fund Created. There is hereby created the “General Obligation Refunding Bonds, Series
2016, Bond Fund” (the “Bond Fund”), which shall be the fund for the payment of principal of and interest
on the Bonds.
All receipts of the Pledged Taxes received by the County Treasurer, acting ex officio as the County
Collector, shall be deposited daily, as far as practicable, with the Trustee. All other moneys appropriated or
used by the County for the payment of the principal or redemption price of and interest on the Bonds shall
be paid to the Trustee. The Trustee shall be accountable only for moneys actually so deposited with the
Trustee. The Trustee is hereby expressly authorized to establish such accounts within the Bond Fund as
shall be necessary to account for the Pledged Taxes levied for each Series of Bonds issued hereunder. All
Pledged Taxes, and all such moneys, shall be deposited by the Trustee into the Bond Fund.
The County Treasurer is hereby expressly authorized and directed to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary to provide for the prompt deposit with the Trustee, in accordance with this Ordinance, of
all Pledged Taxes.
The Bond Fund shall be held and maintained as a separate and segregated account by the Trustee.
The Trustee may create accounts within the Bond Fund as necessary for any Series of Bonds as specified
in a relevant Bond Order. Moneys in the accounts of the Bond Fund may be withdrawn or may be transferred
among the accounts of the Bond Fund by the County upon requisition by the Chief Financial Officer.

Page 186 of 319

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

May 11, 2016

The Pledged Taxes shall either be deposited into the Bond Fund and used solely and only for paying
the principal of and interest on the Bonds or be used to reimburse a fund or account from which advances
to the Bond Fund may have been made to pay principal of or interest on the Bonds prior to receipt of
Pledged Taxes. Interest income or investment profit earned in the Bond Fund shall be retained in the Bond
Fund for payment of future principal of and interest on the Bonds or, to the extent lawful and as determined
by the Chief Financial Officer, transferred to such other funds as may be determined.
B.Escrow Accounts. The sum necessary, as determined by the Chief Financial Officer, of the
principal proceeds and premium, if any, received upon delivery of the Bonds, together with such money in
the debt service funds for the Refunded Bonds as may be advisable for the purpose, shall be used to provide
for the Refunding, pursuant to the provisions of the relevant Escrow Agreement or Escrow Agreements.
Any funds remaining to the credit of the County pursuant to an Escrow Agreement upon the termination of
the Escrow Agreement shall be disbursed by the Escrow Agent to the County as directed by the Chief
Financial Officer.
C.Expense Fund Created. The sum necessary, as determined by the Chief Financial Officer, of the
principal proceeds of each Series of the Bonds shall be deposited into a separate and segregated fund, hereby
created, to be known as the “General Obligation Refunding Bonds, Series 2016 Expense Fund” (the
“Expense Fund”) and shall be disbursed upon the delivery of that Series of Bonds by the Trustee at the
written direction of the Chief Financial Officer or shall be used by the County to pay costs of issuance in
accordance with normal County disbursement procedures. Any funds remaining to the credit of the Expense
Fund on the date which is six months following the date of delivery of the Bonds shall be transferred to the
County Treasurer for deposit into such fund or account of the County as the Chief Financial Officer may
direct.
D.Investments. The moneys on deposit in the Bond Fund may be invested from time to time by the
Trustee at the written direction of the Chief Financial Officer in Qualified Investments. Any such
investments may be sold from time to time by the Trustee without further direction from the County as
moneys may be needed for the purposes for which the Bond Fund has been created. In addition, the Chief
Financial Officer shall direct the Trustee (which direction may be by telephonic, electronic or facsimile
transmission by the County to the Trustee and confirmed by electronic or facsimile transmission by the
Trustee to the County) to sell such investments when necessary to remedy any deficiency in the Bond Fund
or any accounts created therein. All other investment earnings shall be attributed to the account for which
the investment was made.
E.Deposits. All moneys (not including securities) held by the Trustee subject to the provisions of
this Section may be deposited by it, on demand or time deposit, in its banking department or with such
banks, national banking associations, trust companies, savings banks or savings and loan associations, that
are members of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as may be designated by the President or the
Chief Financial Officer. No such moneys shall be deposited with any such financial institution in an amount
exceeding 20 percent of the amount that an officer of such financial institution shall certify to the Trustee
and the Chief Financial Officer as the combined capital and surplus of such financial institution. No such
moneys shall be deposited or remain on deposit with any such financial institution in excess of the amount
insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, unless (a) such financial institution
shall have lodged with the trust department of the Trustee or with a Federal Reserve Bank or branch or,
with the written approval of the Trustee and the Chief Financial Officer, pledged to some other financial

institution for the benefit of the County and the holders of Bonds, as collateral security for the moneys
deposited, Federal Obligations or Agency Obligations having a market value (exclusive of accrued interest)
at least equal to 100 percent of the amount of such moneys, and (b) the Trustee shall have a perfected first
lien in the Federal Obligations or Agency Obligations serving as collateral, and such Federal Obligations
or Agency Obligations shall be free from all third party liens. The Trustee shall allow and credit interest
on any such moneys held by it at such rate as it customarily allows upon similar funds of similar size and
under similar conditions or as required by law. Interest in respect of moneys or on securities in any fund
shall be credited in each case to the fund in which such moneys or securities are held.
F.Repurchase Agreements. The County may invest any moneys pursuant to a repurchase
agreement. Each repurchase agreement shall meet the requirements of the Public Funds Investment Act
of the State of Illinois, as amended, or be secured by Federal Obligations or Agency Obligations or such
Qualified Investments as may be specified in a relevant Bond Order, having a market value, marked to
market weekly, at least equal to 102 percent of the amount invested in the repurchase agreement plus
accrued interest. The Trustee shall at all times have a first lien in such Federal Obligations or Agency
Obligations perfected (i) by possession of certificated securities held by the Trustee or held by a third party
acting on behalf of the Trustee if the institution serving as Trustee is also the counterparty to the repurchase
agreement and is providing the collateral securities, or (ii) under the book-entry procedures specified in 31
Code of Federal Regulations 306.1 et seq. or 31 Code of Federal Regulations 350.0 et seq. The President
or the Chief Financial Officer is hereby authorized to enter into, execute and deliver any investment or
repurchase agreement authorized by this Ordinance, and any additional documents as shall be necessary to
accomplish the purposes of any such agreement.
G.Taxes Levied for Refunded Bonds. To the extent not theretofore abated and as determined
necessary by the Chief Financial Officer, the taxes previously levied and collected (or in the process of
collection) to pay the Refunded Bonds shall be used to effectuate the Refunding as provided in the Escrow
Agreement or shall be used to effectuate the Restructuring, or to the extent not needed due to the issuance
of the Bonds, shall be deposited into the Bond Fund and used to pay first interest coming due on the Bonds.
Taxes previously levied for the Refunded Bonds but not yet extended for collection shall be abated. The
Chief Financial Officer is hereby expressly authorized to file an abatement certificate with the County
Clerk, without further official action of the Corporate Authorities, to effectuate such abatement.
H.Purchase Refunding. The proceeds of any Bonds issued in accordance with Paragraph H of
Section 11 of this Ordinance shall be used to purchase Prior Bonds from their owners on a date or dates not
later than 90 days after the issuance of such Bonds.
Sec. 13.General Tax Covenants.
A.Not Private Activity Bonds. None of the Tax Exempt Bonds shall be a “private activity bond”
as defined in Section 141(a) of the Code.
B.Pertaining to Rebate.
The County further certifies and covenants as follows with respect to the requirements of Section
148(f) of the Code, relating to the rebate of “excess arbitrage profits” (the “Rebate Requirement”) to the
United States:
Page 188 of 319

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

May 11, 2016

1. Unless an applicable exception to the Rebate Requirement is available to the County will
meet the Rebate Requirement.
2. Relating to applicable exceptions, any Designated Officer is hereby authorized to make
such elections under the Code as either such officer shall deem reasonable and in the best
interests of the County.
3. The Designated Officers are hereby expressly authorized and directed to cause to be
established, at such time and in such manner as they may deem necessary or appropriate
hereunder, a “General Obligation Refunding Bonds, Series 2016, Rebate Fund” (the
“Rebate Fund”) for the Tax Exempt Bonds, and such officers shall further, not less
frequently than annually, cause to be transferred to the 148 Compliance Fund the amount
determined to be the accrued liability under the Rebate Requirement or Penalty. Said
Designated Officers are hereby expressly authorized and directed to cause to be paid to
the U.S., without further order or direction from the Corporate Authorities, from time to
time as required, amounts sufficient to meet the Rebate Requirement or to pay the
Penalty.
4. Interest earnings in the Bond Fund are hereby authorized to be transferred, without
further order or direction from the Corporate Authorities, from time to time as required,
to the Rebate Fund for the purposes herein provided; and proceeds of the Tax Exempt
Bonds and other lawfully available funds of the County are also hereby authorized to be
used to meet the Rebate Requirement or to pay the Penalty, but only if necessary after
application of investment earnings as aforesaid.
Sec. 14.Registered Form.
The County recognizes that Section 149 of the Code requires Tax Exempt Bonds to be issued and
to remain in fully registered form in order to be and remain Tax Exempt. In this connection, the County
agrees that it will not take any action to permit Tax Exempt Bonds to be issued in, or converted into, bearer
or coupon form.
Sec. 15.Further Tax-Exemption Covenants.
The County agrees to comply with all provisions of the Code which, if not complied with by the
County, would cause Tax Exempt Bonds not to be Tax Exempt. In furtherance of the foregoing provisions,
but without limiting their generality, the County agrees: (a) through its officers, to make such further
specific covenants, representations as shall be truthful, and assurances as may be necessary or advisable;
(b) to comply with all representations, covenants and assurances contained in certificates or agreements as
may be prepared by Bond Counsel; (c) to consult with Bond Counsel and to comply with such advice as
may be given; (d) to file such forms, statements and supporting documents as may be required and in a
timely manner; and (e) if deemed necessary or advisable by its officers, to employ and pay fiscal agents,
financial advisors, attorneys and other persons to assist the County in such compliance.

Page 189 of 319

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

May 11, 2016

The County also certifies and further covenants with the Underwriters and registered owners of the
Tax Exempt Bonds from time to time outstanding that moneys on deposit in any fund or account in
connection with the Tax Exempt Bonds, whether or not such moneys were derived from the proceeds of
the sale of the Tax Exempt Bonds or from any other source, will not be used in a manner which will cause
the Tax Exempt Bonds to be “arbitrage bonds” within the meaning of Code Section 148 and any lawful
regulations promulgated thereunder, as the same presently exist or may from time to time hereafter be
amended, supplemented or revised.
The County further covenants that it will not take any action, or omit to take any action or permit
the taking or omission of any action within its control (including, without limitation, making or permitting
any use of the proceeds of the Tax Exempt Bonds) if taking, permitting or omitting to take such action
would cause any Tax Exempt Bond to be a private activity bond within the meaning of the Code or would
otherwise cause interest on the Tax Exempt Bonds to be included in the gross income of the recipients
thereof for federal income tax purposes. The County acknowledges that, in the event of an examination
by the Internal Revenue Service of the exemption from federal income taxation of interest on the Tax
Exempt Bonds, under present rules, the County may be treated as a “taxpayer” in the examination and
agrees that it will respond in a commercially reasonable manner to any inquiries from the Internal Revenue
Service in connection with such an examination.
Sec. 16.Opinion of Counsel Exception.
The County reserves the right to use or invest moneys in connection with the Bonds in any manner,
notwithstanding the tax-related covenants set forth in Sections 13 through 15 herein, provided, that it shall
first have received an opinion from Bond Counsel to the effect that such use or investment as contemplated
is valid and proper under applicable law and this Ordinance and that such use or investment will not
adversely affect the Tax Exempt status of the Tax Exempt Bonds.
Sec. 17.Payment and Discharge; Refunding.
The Bonds may be discharged, payment provided for, and the County’s liability terminated as
follows:
(a)Discharge of Indebtedness. If (i) the County shall pay or cause to be paid to the
registered owners of the Bonds the principal, premium, if any, and interest, to become due thereon
at the times and in the manner stipulated therein and herein, (ii) all fees and expenses of the Trustee
shall have been paid, and (iii) the County shall keep, perform and observe all and singular the
covenants and promises in the Bonds and in this Ordinance expressed as to be kept, performed and
observed by it or on its part, then these presents and the rights hereby granted shall cease, determine
and be void. If the County shall pay or cause to be paid to the registered owners of all Outstanding
Bonds of a particular Series, or of a particular maturity within a Series, the principal, premium, if
any, and interest, to become due thereon at the times and in the manner stipulated therein and
herein, such Bonds shall cease to be entitled to any lien, benefit or security under the Ordinance,
and all covenants, agreements and obligations of the County to the holders of such Bonds shall
thereupon cease, terminate and become void and discharged and satisfied.

(b)Provision for Payment. Bonds for the payment or redemption or prepayment of which
sufficient monies or sufficient Defeasance Obligations shall have been deposited with the Trustee
or an escrow agent having fiduciary capacity (whether upon or prior to the maturity or the
redemption date of such Bonds), and accompanied by an express declaration of defeasance of the
Bonds by the Corporate Authorities, shall be deemed to be paid within the meaning of this
Ordinance and no longer outstanding under this Ordinance; provided, however, that if such Bonds
are to be redeemed prior to the maturity thereof, notice of such redemption shall have been duly
given as provided in this Ordinance or arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee shall have been
made for the giving thereof. Defeasance Obligations shall be considered sufficient only if said
investments mature and bear interest in such amounts and at such times as will assure sufficient
cash to pay currently maturing interest and principal and redemption premiums if any when due on
the Bonds without rendering the interest on any Bonds taxable under the Code.
The County may at any time surrender to the Trustee for cancellation by it any Bonds
previously authenticated and delivered hereunder, which the County may have acquired in any
manner whatsoever, and such Bonds, upon such surrender and cancellation, shall be deemed to be
paid and retired.
(c)Termination of County’s Liability.` Upon the discharge of indebtedness under paragraph
(a) hereof, or upon the deposit with the Trustee of sufficient money and Defeasance Obligations
(such sufficiency being determined as provided in paragraph (b) hereof) for the retirement of any
particular Bond or Bonds, all liability of the County in respect of such Bond or Bonds shall cease,
determine and be completely discharged and the holders thereof shall thereafter be entitled only to
payment out of the money and the proceeds of the Defeasance Obligations deposited with aforesaid
for their payment.
Sec. 18.Duties of Trustee.
(a)If the Trustee has received notice, or has actual knowledge that an Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall exercise its rights and powers and use the same degree
of care and skill in their exercise as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances
in the conduct of such person’s own affairs.
(b)The Trustee need perform only those duties that are specifically set forth in this
Ordinance and no others, and no implied covenants or obligations of the Trustee shall be read into
this Ordinance. In the absence of bad faith on its part, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the
truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed, upon certificates or opinions
furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Ordinance. However, the
Trustee shall examine the certificates and opinions to determine whether they conform to the
requirements of this Ordinance.

taken by it in good faith in accordance with the direction of any Insurer or the owners of
the Bonds (in such percentages as may be required by the terms hereof) relating to the time,
method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee,
or exercising any trust or power conferred upon the Trustee, under this Ordinance;
(4)no provision of this Ordinance shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its
own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties
hereunder or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if it shall have reasonable
grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk
or liability is not reasonably assured to it.
(d)Every provision of this Ordinance that in any way relates to the Trustee is subject to all
the paragraphs of this Section.
(e)The Trustee may refuse to perform any duty or exercise any right or power, or to make
any payment on any Bond to any holder of such Bond, unless it receives indemnity satisfactory to
it against any loss, liability or expense.
(f)The Trustee shall not be liable for interest on any cash held by it except as the Trustee
may agree with the County or as set forth herein.
(g)For all purposes under this Ordinance, the Trustee shall not be deemed to have notice
of any Event of Default described in Section 26 herein (iii), (iv) or (v) hereof unless a responsible
officer of the Trustee has actual knowledge thereof or unless written notice of any event which is
in fact such an Event of Default is received by the Trustee at the Corporate Trust Office, and such
notice references any of the Bonds generally or this Ordinance.
(h)The permissive right of the Trustee to perform any discretionary act enumerated in this
Ordinance shall not be construed as a duty, and the Trustee shall not be answerable for other than

in it by this Ordinance or to institute, conduct or defend any litigation hereunder or in relation hereto

satisfactory to the Trustee against the costs, expenses and liabilities which may be incurred therein
or thereby.
Sec. 20.Individual Rights of Trustee.

hereunder, respectively, and all rights, remedies and powers of the Trustee shall continue as though no such
proceeding had been taken.
Sec. 29.Right of Holders to Control Proceedings.
Subject to the provisions of any Commitment, anything in this Ordinance to the contrary
notwithstanding, the registered owners of a majority in principal amount of the Bonds then outstanding
shall have the right, by an instrument in writing executed and delivered to the Trustee, to direct the method
and place of conducting all remedial proceedings to be taken by the Trustee hereunder in respect of the
Bonds, respectively; provided that such direction shall not be otherwise than in accordance with law and
the Trustee shall be indemnified to its satisfaction against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred
therein or thereby.
Sec. 30.Right of Holders to Institute Suit.
Subject to the provisions of any Commitment, no holder of any of the Bonds shall have any right
to institute any suit, action or proceeding in equity or at law for the execution of any trust hereunder, or for
any other remedy hereunder or on the Bonds unless such holder previously shall have given to the Trustee
written notice of an Event of Default as hereinabove provided, and unless also the registered owners of
twenty-five percent (25%) in principal amount of the Bonds then outstanding shall have made written
request of the Trustee after the right to exercise such powers, or right of action, as the case may be, shall
have accrued, and shall have afforded the Trustee a reasonable opportunity either to proceed to exercise the
powers hereinbefore granted, or to institute such action, suit, or proceeding in its name; and unless, also,
there shall have been offered to the Trustee security and indemnity satisfactory to it against the costs,
expenses and liabilities to be incurred therein or thereby, and the Trustee shall have refused or neglected to
comply with such request within a reasonable time; and such notification, request and offer of indemnity
are hereby declared in every such case, at the option of the Trustee, to be conditions precedent to the
execution of the powers and trusts of this Ordinance or for any other remedy hereunder; it being understood
and intended that no one or more holders of the Bonds shall have any right in any manner whatever by his,
her or their action to affect, disturb or prejudice the security of this Ordinance, or to enforce any right
hereunder, except in the manner herein provided, and that all proceedings at law or in equity shall be

same, at the time and place in the Bonds expressed.
Sec. 31.Suits by Trustee.
All rights of action under this Ordinance, or under any of the Bonds, enforceable by the Trustee,
may be enforced by it without the possession of any of the Bonds or the production thereof at the trial or

in its name for the ratable benefit of the holders of the Bonds affected by such suit or proceeding, subject
to the provisions of this Ordinance.
Sec. 32.Remedies Cumulative.
No remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee, the Bondholders, or to the Insurer is
intended to be exclusive of any other remedy or remedies, and each and every such remedy shall be
cumulative, and shall be in addition to every other remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at
law or in equity or by statute.
Sec. 33.Waiver of Default.
No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Bondholder to exercise any right or power accruing
upon any default shall impair any such right or power or shall be construed to be a waiver of any such
default, or an acquiescence therein; and every power and remedy given by this Section to the Trustee and
the Bondholders, respectively, may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed
expedient. In the event any Event of Default shall be waived by the Bondholders or the Trustee, acting at
the direction, or with the consent of, the Bondholders, such waiver shall be limited to the particular Event
of Default so waived and shall not be deemed to waive any other Event of Default hereunder.

(1)First, to the payment of all reasonable costs and expenses of collection, fees, and other
amounts due to the Trustee hereunder; and thereafter,
(2)Second, to the payment of amounts, if any, payable to the United States Treasury
pursuant to any Tax Agreement;
(3)All such monies shall be applied as follows:
(A)first, to the payment to the persons entitled thereto of all installments of interest
on Outstanding Bonds then due, in the order of the maturity of such installments, and, if
the amount available shall not be sufficient to pay in full any particular installment, then to

Page 197 of 319

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

May 11, 2016

the payment ratably, according to the amounts due on such installment, to the persons
entitled thereto, without any discrimination or preference; and
(B)second, to the payment to the persons entitled thereto of the unpaid principal
and premium, if any, on any of the Outstanding Bonds which shall have become due (other
than Bonds matured or called for redemption for the payment of which monies are held
pursuant to the provisions of this Ordinance), in the order of their due dates, with interest
upon such Outstanding Bonds from the respective dates upon which they became due, and,
if the amount available shall not be sufficient to pay in full Outstanding Bonds due on any
particular date, together with such premium, then to the payment ratably according to the
amount of principal and premium due on such date, and then to the payment of such
principal ratably according to the amount of such principal due on such date, to the persons
entitled thereto without any discrimination or preference.
Whenever monies are to be applied by the Trustee pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph, such monies
shall be applied by the Trustee at such times, and from time to time, as the Trustee shall determine upon
consultation with the County, having due regard to the amount of such monies available for application and
the likelihood of additional monies becoming available for such application in the future. The deposit of
such monies with the paying agents, or otherwise setting aside such monies, in trust for the proper purpose,
shall constitute proper application by the Trustee; and the Trustee shall incur no liability whatsoever to the
County to any Bondholder or to any other person for any delay in applying any such funds, so long as the
Trustee acts with reasonable diligence, having due regard to the circumstances, and ultimately applies the
same in accordance with such provisions of this Ordinance as may be applicable at the time of application
by the Trustee. Whenever the Trustee shall apply such funds, it shall fix the date (which shall be an interest
payment date unless the Trustee shall deem another date more suitable) upon which such application is to
be made and upon such date interest on the amounts of principal paid on such date shall cease to accrue.
The Trustee shall give such notice as it may deem appropriate of the fixing of any such date and of the
endorsement to be entered on each Bond on which payment shall be made, and shall not be required to
make payment to the holder of any unpaid Bond until such Bond shall be presented to the Trustee for
appropriate endorsement, or some other procedure deemed satisfactory by the Trustee.

The provisions of this Ordinance shall constitute a contract between the County and the registered
owners of the Bonds, and no changes, additions or alterations of any kind shall be made hereto, except as

contained, other covenants and agreements thereafter to be observed or to surrender,
restrict or limit any right or power herein reserved to or conferred upon the County;
(ii)To make such provisions for the purpose of curing any ambiguity, or of curing,
correcting or supplementing any defective provision contained in this Ordinance, or in
regard to matters or questions arising under this Ordinance, as the County may deem
necessary or desirable and not inconsistent with this Ordinance and which in the opinion

as evidenced by an opinion of counsel delivered to the Trustee;
(iii)To designate one or more tender or similar agents of the Trustee, bond
registrars or paying agents;
(iv)To comply with the provisions of Section 17 hereof when money and the

Any supplemental Ordinance authorized by the provisions of this Section may be passed by the County and
accepted by the Trustee without the consent of or notice to the registered owners of any of the Bonds at the
time outstanding, but with notice to the Insurer, notwithstanding any of the provisions of paragraph (b) of
this Section, but the Trustee shall not be obligated to accept any such supplemental Ordinance which affects
the Trustee’s own rights, duties or immunities under this Ordinance or otherwise.
(b)Supplemental Ordinances Requiring Consent of Bondholders. With the consent
(evidenced as provided in Section 40 hereof) of the registered owners of not less than a majority in
aggregate principal amount of the Bonds, at the time outstanding, and subject to any Commitment,
the County, by the Corporate Authorities may pass, and the Trustee may accept from time to time
and at any time an Ordinance or Ordinances supplemental hereto for the purpose of adding any
provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of this Ordinance or
of any supplemental Ordinance; provided that no such modification or amendment shall extend the
maturity or reduce the interest rate on, or permit the creation of a preference or priority of any
Outstanding Bond or Outstanding Bonds over any other Outstanding Bond or Outstanding Bonds,
or otherwise alter or impair the obligation of the County to pay the principal, interest or redemption
premium, if any, at the time and place and at the rate and in the currency provided therein of any
Bond, without the express consent of the registered owner of such Bond or permit the creation of a
preference or priority of any Bond or Bonds over any other Bond or Bonds, or reduce the percentage
of Bonds, respectively, required for the affirmative vote or written consent to an amendment or
modification, or deprive the registered owners of the Bonds (except as aforesaid) of the right to
payment of the Bonds from the Pledged Taxes, or alter or impair the obligations of the County with
respect to the Tax Exempt status, the registration, transfer, exchange or notice of redemption of
Bonds, without the consent of the registered owners of all Outstanding Bonds affected; nor shall
Page 199 of 319

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

any such modification or amendment reduce the percentage of the registered owners of Outstanding
Bonds required for the written consent of such modification or amendment without the consent of
the owners of all of the Outstanding Bonds. Upon receipt by the Trustee of a certified copy of
such Ordinance and upon the filing with the Trustee of evidence of the consent of Bondholders as
aforesaid, the Trustee shall accept unless such supplemental Ordinance affects the Trustee’s own
rights, duties or immunities under this Ordinance or otherwise, in which case the Trustee may in
its discretion, but shall not be obligated to, accept such supplemental Ordinance.

of principal and interest by a municipal bond or financial guaranty insurance policy, a letter of credit, or

discretion, and whose consent shall be binding on such owners and all successors in interest. Ownership
of Bonds for purposes of consent by the registered owners thereof shall be conclusively proved by the Bond
Register.

pertaining to the Bonds pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph, the County shall publish a notice,
setting forth in general terms the substance of such supplemental Ordinance, at least once in a financial

general circulation among dealers in municipal securities in the County of New York, New York. If,
because of temporary or permanent suspension of the publication or general circulation of any financial
newspaper or journal or for any other reason it is impossible or impractical to publish such notice of
supplemental Ordinance in the manner herein provided, then such publication in lieu thereof as shall be
made with the approval of the Trustee shall constitute sufficient publication of notice. Any failure of the
County to given such notice, or any defect therein, shall not, however, in any way impair or affect the
validity of any such supplemental Ordinance.
(c)Supplemental Ordinance to Modify this Ordinance. Upon the execution of any
supplemental Ordinance pursuant to the provisions of this Section, this Ordinance shall be modified
and amended in accordance therewith and the respective rights, duties and obligations under this
Ordinance of the County, the Trustee and all registered owners of Bondholders, respectively,
outstanding thereunder shall thereafter be determined, exercised and enforced hereunder subject in
all respects to such modification and amendments, and all the terms and conditions of any such
supplemental Ordinance shall be and be deemed to be part of the terms and conditions of this

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

Account(s): N/A
Summary: The Department of Planning and Development within the Bureau of Economic Development
respectfully submits the attached Community Development Block Grant - Disaster Recovery project loan
recommendation in the amount of $7,000,000.00 to Presidio Capital, LLC. This project loan will be
utilized to support CDBG -DR-eligible project costs incurred during the new construction of 29 new
townhomes and single family homes in Cicero, Illinois as replacement housing for households displaced
by the 2013 Flood. The area of Cicero where these homes will be built (northeast corner) is not in a 100
year flood plain, but is near transit and meets the new energy star ratings for new construction. The
construction of these units is in keeping with Planning for Progress and the CDBG -Disaster Recovery
Action Plan.
The requested CDBG -DR funds would subsidize the project via a permanent loan based upon the following
terms:
Loan Type: Construction Loan will be provided to the Developer, and then the down payment assistance
will be recorded as Second Mortgage by Cook County and remain subordinate to the permanent
first
mortgage to the homebuyer
Interest Rate: The loan will be a zero percent (0%) interest repayable of the sale of each home to a qualified
homebuyer
Loan Term: The Project is estimated to have a “construction” phase of (12) months to complete with a
detailed schedule to be set forth in final loan documents subject to the guidance and final approval of
HUD.
Lien Position: County is the sole lender and recorded in first position during construction and then Cook
County will award on a case by case needs basis a second mortgage for each homebuyer to ensure
compliance with the abovementioned Affordability Period.
Buyer Down Payment Assistance: Qualified Buyers will receive down payment assistance based upon
individual needs. Fifteen properties will be sold to Buyers with less than 80 percent of AMI and fourteen
properties will be sold to Buyers with less than 120 percent of AMI.
Affordability Period for Home Buyer: The homebuyer will be awarded a second mortgage on the
property based upon the needs of each qualified homebuyer. The second mortgage will come with an
affordability period of 15 years if the subsidy is $20,000 or less and 20 years if the subsidy is $20,001 or
more.
Guarantee: Presidio Capital, LLC guarantees that any home not sold by 12/31/2017 will be repaid in
“balance” (outstanding balance minus any projected developer subsidy) to the County, after the complete
exhaustion of the “sales plan” initiative. On 10/1/2017 any unsold units will be evaluated and determine
the units prices need to be decreased or if an extension beyond 12/31/2017 is necessary to sell all units. If
on 12/31/2017 units still remain unsold the County and Developer have the option to convert the units to
supportive services rental housing units in conjunction with an approved non-profit agency. Finally, any

reprogrammed funds will be utilized at the sole discretion of the County for projects that are eligible
under the CDBG-DR regulations.
The Bureau would like to request approval for the attached recommended CDBG -DR project loan and
authorization to proceed to execute on behalf of the County of Cook, any and all documents necessary to
further the aforementioned project.
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) provided the County with the
CDBG -DR funds due to the flooding that occurred in April of 2013. The Cook County Board has approved
The Action Plan for the CDBG - DR funds on 3/12/2014 with two Substantial Amendments on 9/10/2014
and 4/1/2015.
This project is being submitted for review by the Housing and Community Development Committee and
then for Board Approval on 5/11/2016. As such, this item will require Board review and approval in the
same meeting on 5/11/2016.

WHEREAS, on average 1,000 people die each year from gunshot wounds in our state. The gun death toll
in Illinois in 2013 included 576 homicides and 496 suicides; and
WHEREAS, guns are used in over 70% of all homicides in Illinois; and

Page 300 of 319

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

May 11, 2016

WHEREAS, the price of one gun homicide costs an average of $441,000 in direct costs (including law
enforcement, medical expenses, court costs, and prison), of which 87% is paid by taxpayers; and
WHEREAS, each gun death averages about $6 million in total costs, including both direct and indirect
costs; and
WHEREAS, Chicago police officers recover more than twice the number of crime guns per capita than in
Los Angeles, and more than seven times than in New York City; and
WHEREAS, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms & Explosives (“ATF”) almost all the
guns recovered after being used in crimes were originally sold by retail dealers; and
WHEREAS, corrupt gun dealers represent a major source of illegally trafficked firearms, making oversight
of dealers critical; and
WHEREAS, between 2009 and 2013, four particular gun dealers, each located a short drive outside
Chicago, supplied 20% of all guns recovered from Chicago crime scenes. These stores supplied thousands
of crime guns; and
WHEREAS, firearms dealers are subject to very little federal oversight, and on average are inspected only
once a decade, primarily because ATF lacks the resources and authority to monitor the 138,000 gun dealers,
manufacturers, collectors, and others that it licenses; and
WHEREAS, lack of oversight makes it far too easy for gun dealers to turn a blind eye to “straw purchasers,”
and other traffickers who fill out the paperwork and undergo background checks in order to provide guns
to criminals or other people ineligible to possess guns; and
WHEREAS, states that do not permit or require law enforcement inspections of gun dealers are the sources
of crime guns recovered in other states at a rate that is 50% greater than states that do, showing that illegal
trafficking of guns could be substantially reduced with better oversight of gun dealers; and
WHEREAS, measures such as law enforcement inspections, background checks for employees, inventory
inspections, video surveillance and improved security, and restrictions on the location of gun dealers and
ranges, would promote best practices, discourage theft, and thwart illegal sales and straw purchases; and
WHEREAS, the State of Illinois possesses the infrastructure and resources to institute licensing and
regulation of gun dealerships, by requiring them to obtain a state license from the Department of Financial
& Professional Regulation (IDPFR); and
WHEREAS, the State of Illinois licenses and regulates a wide range of professions to promote public
safety, health, and welfare, from acupuncturists and cosmetologists to real estate appraisers and professional
geologists, but not gun dealers; and
WHEREAS, too many Illinois families have suffered the loss of a loved one and too many innocent people
have been injured or lost their lives as bystanders or victims of gun crimes; and

(12) Class 8. Real estate used primarily for industrial and commercial purposes, consisting of all newly
constructed buildings or other structures, including the land upon which they are situated; or
abandoned property, as defined in this division, including the land upon which such property is
situated; or all buildings and other structures which are substantially rehabilitated to the extent such
rehabilitation has added to their value, including qualified land related to the rehabilitation.
a. Land qualifies when the rehabilitation adds vertical or horizontal square footage to the
improvements. The amount of land eligible for the incentive shall be in such proportion as
the square footage added by the rehabilitation bears to the total square footage of the
improvements on the parcel. Such real estate must be either obtained through the Cook
County Tax Reactivation Project or must be located in one of the following designated
geographical areas:

1.

An area which has been certified as in need of substantial revitalization in
accordance with the provisions of Section 74-65(b);

2.

An enterprise community as proposed and approved by the County Board on June
22, 1994, or the Chicago City Council on May 18, 1994, and the municipality in
which such real estate is located, or, if in an unincorporated area, the County must
by lawful Resolution determine that such real estate is consistent with an overall
plan for the rehabilitation of the area; or

3.

Any one of the following five townships: Bloom, Bremen, Calumet, Rich and
Thornton.

b. In the instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property
as defined herein, the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may still
determine that special circumstances justify that the property is deemed "abandoned" for
purpose of Class 8, unless:

1.

There has been a purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have
not been vacant and unused prior to such purchase; or

2.

There has been no purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have
been vacant and unused for less than 24 continuous months.

The finding of abandonment, along with the specification of the special circumstances,
shall be included in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and consenting to the Class 8
application. If the Ordinance or Resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the
County Board is required to validate such, a finding that the property is deemed
"abandoned" for purposes of Class 8, and a Resolution to that effect shall be obtained. The
applicant must obtain the municipal enabling Ordinance with the required finding of
special circumstances and present such municipal Ordinance to the Board of
Commissioners of Cook County prior to its determination as to whether it will validate
such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 8 and provide
Page 303 of 319

a County Resolution to that effect. A certified copy of an Ordinance or Resolution finding
that special circumstances exist, as well as a certified copy of a County Ordinance or
Resolution validating such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes
of Class 8 need not be filed at the time of filing the Class 8 application with the Assessor,
but must be filed with the Assessor no later than the date an assessment appeal is filed to
request the class change to Class 8. If the Resolution is not filed at the time of the Class 8
application, the applicant shall instead file, at that time, a letter from the municipality or
the County as the case may be, confirming that a Resolution or Ordinance regarding special
circumstances has been requested.
Temporary Emergency Economic Recovery Modification (TEERM) Program: In the
instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as defined
herein, the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may still determine that
special circumstances justify that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purpose of Class
8 under the TEERM Program, if there has been no purchase for value and the buildings
and other structures have been vacant and unused for at least 12 continuous months. The
finding of abandonment, along with the specification of the special circumstances, shall be
included in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and consenting to the Class 8
application. If the Ordinance or Resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the
County Board is required to validate such, a finding that the property is deemed
"abandoned" for purposes of Class 8, and a Resolution to that effect shall be obtained. The
applicant must obtain the municipal enabling Ordinance with the required finding of
special circumstances and present such municipal Ordinance to the Board of
Commissioners of Cook County prior to its determination as to whether it will validate
such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 8 and provide
a County Resolution to that effect. A certified copy of an Ordinance or Resolution finding
that special circumstances exist, as well as a certified copy of a County Ordinance or
Resolution validating such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes
of Class 8 need not be filed at the time of filing the Class 8 application with the Assessor,
but must be filed with the Assessor no later than the date an assessment appeal is filed to
request the class change to Class 8. If the Resolution is not filed at the time of the Class 8
application, the applicant shall instead file, at that time, a letter from the municipality or
the County as the case may be, confirming that a Resolution or Ordinance regarding special
circumstances has been requested.
Applications for the TEERM Program must be received by the Assessor's Office on or
before November 30, 2018 to receive consideration.

c.

A copy of the Resolution or letter confirming that a Resolution has been requested,
whichever is filed with the application, will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the
Secretary of the County Board for distribution to the members of the County Board from
the affected districts.

d.

An affidavit of the applicant attesting that all construction, demolition, maintenance or
repair services at the subject property shall only be performed by a contractor or

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

Apprenticeship, shall also be submitted with the application. The Assessor or the Bureau
of Economic Development shall provide by rule for the filing of such affidavit and the
filing of any subsequent supporting documents which establishes credible evidence that
any construction, maintenance or repair service performed at the subject property will
be done by a contractor or subcontractor who participates in an active apprenticeship
and training program approved and registered with the United States Department of
Labor’s Office of Apprenticeship. The failure to file such affidavit and supporting
documents within the time established by the Assessor’s rules shall result in the loss of
the incentive for the period relating to the non-filing.

e d. This classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the date of new
construction (excluding demolition, if any) or substantial rehabilitation was completed and
initially assessed, or in the case of abandoned property, from the date of substantial reoccupancy, or in the case of incentives granted pursuant to the TEERM Program, from the
date of the notice of approval.

f e. Unless it was granted pursuant to the TEERM Program, this incentive may be renewed
during the last year a property is entitled to a ten-percent assessment level pursuant to
Section 74-64(11), if the following requirements are met:

1.

The taxpayer notifies the Assessor's Office of the taxpayer's intent to request
renewal of the incentive from the municipality, or the County
Board if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area;

2.

The municipality in which the real estate is located or the County Board, if the
real estate is located in an unincorporated area, adopts a Resolution expressly
stating that the municipality or County Board, as the case may be, has
determined that the industrial or commercial use of the property is necessary
and beneficial to the local economy, and supports and consents to renewal of
the Class 8; and

3.

A copy of that Resolution and a completed renewal application are filed with
the Assessor's Office before the expiration of the ten-percent assessment level
period.

4.

Applicant shall submit an affidavit to the Bureau of Economic
Development attesting that, at all times after the applicant receives and
maintains a Class 8 designation, if any construction, demolition, maintenance
or repair service is performed at the subject property, then any contractors and
any subcontractors who perform such service must participate in an active
apprenticeship and training program approved and registered with the United
States Department of Labor’s Office of Apprenticeship.

g f. Class 8 incentives that are granted pursuant to the TEERM Program are not renewable.
For all other Class 8 incentives, the number of renewal periods is not limited as long as the
property continues to apply and meet the requirements for Class 8.

h g. A copy of the request for renewal of the incentive will be forwarded by the Assessor's
Office to the Secretary of the County Board for distribution to the members of the County
Board from the affected districts.

i h. If no renewal is obtained, the incentive shall be phased out over the next two years,
pursuant to Section 74-64(11). After expiration of the last incentive period the real estate
shall revert to the applicable classification under this Division.

j i. The Assessor may adopt rules consistent with this subsection necessary to ensure proper
review of all factors relevant to determine eligibility for the benefits provided under Class
8.

k j. The certification of an area as in need of substantial revitalization shall expire five years
from the date such certification is granted. The Assessor shall notify the applicant of the
date of expiration of certification one year before the date of the expiration of the
certification. Such certification, pursuant to the same criteria, may be extended for one
additional five-year period subject to reapplication by the appropriate local governing body
within the period from one year to six months prior to the expiration of the initial five-year
period.

l k. The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports by all
Class 8 recipients as to the use of the property and the number of persons employed at the
Class 8 site. A copy of such reports will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the
Secretary of the County Board for distribution to members of the County Board from the
affected districts. Failure to file such reports within the time established by the Assessor's
rules shall result in loss of the incentive for the period relating to the non-filing.
m. Taxpayers who currently receive a Class 8 incentive shall file with the Bureau of Economic
Development an affidavit as required under subsection (d) of this Section within 90 days
of the enactment that will be applicable for all future construction, demolition,
maintenance or repair services performed at the subject property as required under
subsection (d) of this Section. Failure to provide the affidavit in a timely manner may

located in an unincorporated area, an agreement to abate a portion of the local government's
sales tax generated by the industrial or commercial enterprise located on such real estate and
such abatement of sales tax must cover the period of time for which the applicant would
qualify for this Class 8a incentive; and

b.

Applicant can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Cook County Board of Commissioners
that due to national and regional economic conditions beyond its control the industrial or
commercial enterprise has undergone a significant reduction in net operating income of at
least 40 percent in the year it makes application for this incentive as compared to the average
net operating income of the industrial or commercial enterprise in the prior three years; and

c.

Applicant provides objective and credible evidence including, but not limited to, an
economic impact study that demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Cook County Board of
Commissioners that the ongoing industrial or commercial enterprise is not economically
viable and as such it will cease operations within 60 days of the submission of an eligibility

will become vacant and unused for an extended period of time of at least 24 months; and

d.

Applicant provides objective and credible evidence including, but not limited to, an
economic impact study that demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Cook County Board of

remainder of the five-year term.

(5) In order for real estate to qualify for a Class 8a designation an eligibility application must be made

Resolutions are provided to the Cook County Assessor; and the Cook County Assessor determines

(7) The Cook County Assessor may adopt rules consistent with this Section to determine eligibility
for the benefits provided under Class 8a.

(8) Upon receipt of an eligibility application for a Class 8a designation, the Cook County Assessor

where the property has been acquired for hospital use by a for-profit acquirer unrelated to the not-for-profit
disposer, thereby avoiding Illinois Health Facilities and Services Review Board discontinuation approval,
shall be considered for a Class 8b designation if it meets the requirements of this Section and the Cook
County Board of Commissioners provides a Resolution or Ordinance in support of such designation.

(1) The Cook County Board of Commissioners may only provide such a Resolution or Ordinance in
support of Class 8b designation when:

a.

The applicant is a hospital, as defined in the Hospital Licensing Act, or an entity that owns
the real property on which a hospital is located, the hospital is licensed by the state, and the
abandonment of the hospital would require the applicant, or the hospital on behalf of which
the applicant owns the real property on which the hospital is located, to obtain a permit or
exemption from the State of Illinois Health Facilities and Services Review Board pursuant
to the Illinois Health Facilities Planning Act prior to discontinuing hospital operations and
to obtain a second permit or exemption prior to reopening or otherwise reestablishing the
hospital after abandonment;

b.

The applicant demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Cook County Assessor that approval of
the Class 8b designation will materially increase the likelihood that the property will be
retained for hospital use with the associated employment benefits relative to industrial or
commercial use of the property;

c.

The subject hospital is located in a zip code which has a ten-percent or greater incidence of
families and/or individuals below the poverty level, as identified by the U.S. Census Bureau's
most recent census; and

d.

The subject hospital employs at least 750 full-time equivalents (full-time equivalent jobs
being defined as total hours worked by all non-full-time employees divided by average
annual hours worked by the full-time employees).

e.

Applicant must provide credible evidence that, at all times after the applicant receives and
maintains a Class 8 designation, if any construction, demolition, maintenance or repair
service is performed at the subject property, then any contractors and any subcontractors
who perform such service must participate in an active apprenticeship and training program

designation will materially increase the likelihood that the property will be retained for
hospital use; and

b.

A statement by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that it supports and consents to
the designation of the property as a Class 8b property.

(3) When the real estate is located in an incorporated area of the county, and designation as a Class
8b property is sought using the provisions of this Section, the municipality in which the real estate
is located must provide to the Cook County Assessor a resolution or ordinance that contains the
following:

a.

A finding by the corporate authorities of the municipality that the proposed redevelopment
contemplated for the subject hospital or the property on which the hospital sits is necessary
and appropriate and that, without a classification having the impact of this Section, the
special circumstances that exist on the property on which the subject hospital sits including,
but not limited to, the unique requirement that mandates that the subject hospital's operations
are continually maintained without interruption in order for the State of Illinois Health
Facilities and Services Review Board to issue a certificate of need and licensure approval
for the continued operation of the subject hospital and the extraordinary need for the
continued operation of the subject hospital within the applicable region, will not be addressed
and the property on which the subject hospital sits will become vacant and underutilized and
cause the continued exasperation of blighted factors within the municipality and region;

b.

A finding by the corporate authorities of the municipality that a classification having the
impact of this Section is necessary for the redevelopment to occur on the property on which
the subject hospital sits; and

c.

A statement by the corporate authorities of the municipality supporting and consenting to
the filing of an application for a classification having the impact of this Section for the
property on which the subject hospital sits.

(4) Real estate receiving a Class 8b designation pursuant to the provisions of this Section shall be
assessed at the lowest percentage of market value and for the term provided for in Section 7464(12).

(5) In order for real estate to qualify for a Class 8b designation, a Class 8 or Class 8b application must

Services Review Board discontinuation approval, shall be reconsidered as an application pursuant
to this Section upon supplement of such Class 8 application with the additional information
required in this Section, if any. Upon receipt of an application, the Cook County Assessor shall
forward such application and any supporting documentation provided with the application to the
Cook County Board of Commissioners for consideration as to whether the Cook County Board
will provide a resolution or ordinance in support of a Class 8b designation. Real estate receiving
a Class 8b designation pursuant to the provisions of this Section shall be eligible for such
designation beginning in the assessment year during which an application for the classification
having the impact of this Section is made to the Cook County Assessor.

(6) Class 8b designation cannot be applied to real estate unless the following has occurred:
application is made or has been made to the Cook County Assessor, and all required municipal
and county Ordinances and Resolutions are provided to the Cook County Assessor.
Effective date: This ordinance shall be in effect immediately upon adoption.
