 ACTION ITEMS
Ohio Turnpike and Infrastructure Commission (OTIC) Membership
Ms. Gallucci reminded the Governance Committee of the previous meeting discussion about
making OTIC a member of the NOACA Board.
County Executive Budish asked about the relationship between OTIC and ODOT. Ms. Gallucci
stated that the two agencies are independent, but the ODOT Director is a member of the OTIC
board. County Executive Budish asked if ODOT is a member of NOACA. Ms. Gallucci said yes.
Commissioner Hutson asked what the benefit would be to making OTIC a member. Ms. Gallucci
stated that OTIC could provide its perspective on specific projects, funding available, advanced
technologies and opportunities for collaboration.
After discussing the issue, the Governance Committee agreed that OTIC should be an ex-officio
member of the NOACA Board.
A motion was made by Commissioner Lundy to recommend to the Executive Committee that
OTIC be made an ex-officio member of the NOACA Board. The motion was seconded by
Commissioner John Hamercheck. The motion passed by voice vote.
Ms. Gallucci mentioned that if the recommendation is approved by the Board, an amendment to
the NOACA Code of Regulations would be required, which would have to be ratified by all five
counties.
Commissioner Hutson asked what the timeframe would be to get the membership ratified.
Ms. Gallucci said it would depend on when the recommendation is approved by the Board.
NOACA Board Membership by Population
Ms. Gallucci provided background on previous Committee discussions about the NOACA Board
membership; shortage of two seats for the City of Cleveland; and previous attempts to get the
Code of Regulations ratified. Ms. Gallucci presented the following options for the Committee to
consider:
•

Reintroduce the amendment to the Code correcting the math error made with
respect to the City of Cleveland’s representation and awarding two additional board
seats to the City, resulting in a board of 46 voting members.

•

Reintroduce the amendment to address the issue of representation by population,
providing for automatic adjustments based on the decennial census, as well as
codifying the three-member minimum for each county.

A motion was made by Mr. Jim Cordes to recommend the two options to the Executive Committee.
The motion was seconded by Commissioner Hutson.
After discussing the above-referenced options, the original motion was withdrawn.
A motion was made by Commissioner Hutson and seconded by Mr. Cordes to recommend to the
Executive Committee the following:
8305c
1-2

 •
•
•
•

Add two seats to the Board
Provide a minimum of three seats per the Code of Regulations
Apportion the seats by population which would be adjusted automatically by the decennial
census
Delay implementation until after the decennial census

Commissioner Lundy suggested that staff take a look at the impact the change would have on
NOACA dues. Ms. Gallucci said there would be no impact since the dues are based on
population. She provided examples of how dues may be determined in the future.
Commissioner Lundy stated that when Lorain County offered to surrender one of its seats, it was
done as a compromise to get the Code of Regulations ratified.
The Governance Committee voted and the motion passed by voice vote.

NORTHEAST OHIO AREAWIDE COORDINATING AGENCY
MEMORANDUM
TO:

Governance Committee

FROM:

Grace Gallucci, Executive Director

DATE:

November 1, 2019

RE:

Membership Expansion of Advisory Councils

ACTION REQUESTED
The Governance Committee will be asked to consider expanding the membership of the Advisory Councils
to include emerging future leaders.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION FOR CURRENT ACTION
The purpose of expanding the membership count to the Councils will allow young professionals
opportunities to help advance and reinforce NOACA’s mission and agenda. The inclusion of emerging
future leaders is expected to help spark new ideas, approaches and perspectives for growing NOACA’s
stakeholder and community connections, especially targeting specific messages to other future leaders.
The request includes the expansion of three seats for each council. The future leaders will help the Council
build and enhance relationships with various government agencies and subdivisions, the media and
general public. NOACA advisory councils made up of business representatives, the general public and
large groups, could better inform the Committee’s recommendations to the NOACA Board of
Directors and enhance NOACA’s advocacy on infrastructure-related and environmental issues.
The Councils help monitor community reactions to agency policy, proposals, and progress early in the
planning process, and supplement the public involvement activities that NOACA staff performs. The
Councils also assist the External Affairs Committee in developing agency policies for outreach to the
public, business and rural communities.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact at this time.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
The External Affairs Committee and NOACA staff will recruit members for each advisory council and
establish meeting schedules.
