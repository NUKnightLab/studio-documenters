June 2nd 2017, Meeting Overview

The Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority’s (ICJIA) Quarterly Board Meeting will be held Friday,
June 2nd, from 9 a.m. to 11:30 p.m. at the Michael A. Bilandic Building, 160 N. LaSalle, N-505, in
Chicago. To enter the Bilandic Building, visitors must present a valid State I.D. and pass through a metal
detector. All ICJIA Board meetings are subject to the Open Meetings Act. Members of the general public
are encouraged to attend. ICJIA’s statutorily-created oversight Board serves a unique and vital role in
improving the State’s public safety outcomes. Composed of state and local public safety officials, policy
experts, and community leaders, the Board is designed to embody and represent the state’s criminal justice
system and is tasked with setting agency priorities, tracking the progress of ongoing programs, and
overseeing the agency’s grant-making. To that end, ICJIA’s quarterly Board meetings bring research and
practical insights to bear on important and emerging issues affecting public safety in Illinois with the goal
of identifying how the agency should address them through research and grant-making.
At the June Board meeting, members and agency staff will honor the legacy of Dr. Candice Kane, who
passed away in March of this year, by presenting Dr. Dave Olson with the first annual Candice Kane
Lifetime Service Award. Dr. Kane spent over 20 years at ICJIA and led the agency as Executive Director
for seven of those years. She retired in 2014 from University of Illinois at Chicago, Cure Violence, where
she was Chief Operating Officer. In her career, Dr. Kane was dedicated to using research, collaboration,
and innovation to improve public safety outcomes. This annual award will recognize individual whose
career in Illinois exemplifies this legacy of service. Many of you, of course, know and have worked with
Dr. Olson, who began his career as a researcher at ICJIA and is now a Professor in the Criminal Justice and
Criminology at Loyola University Chicago, where he also co-directs the Center for Criminal Justice
Research, Policy, and Practice.
After this recognition, executive staff will provide Members with essential updates on the agency’s work.
This will include updates on our federal formula grants, state-funded programs, and our strategic policy
initiatives. ICJIA’s executive director and general counsel will also give a brief overview of basic of Board
member responsibilities.
The meeting will conclude with a Research, Policy, and Practice Presentation, giving an Overview of the
National and State Opioid Crisis. Jessica Reichert, M.S., Manager of ICJIA’s Center for Justice Research
and Evaluation, will lead the presentation. The presentation will provide a national and state overview of
the opioid crisis including current criminal justice efforts and challenges to reducing opioid use disorders,
overdoses, and related criminal justice involvement. Following the presentation, a panel of experts will
