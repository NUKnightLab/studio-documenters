PROPOSED ORDINANCE

ORDINANCE AMENDING CHAPTER 46 OF THE COOK COUNTY CODE OF ORDINANCES
CONCERNING BY ADDING A NEW SECTION 46-3 8 PROHIBITING THE
USE OF CHOKE HOLDS BY COOK COUNTY LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS

WHEREAS, the County of Cook is a Home Rule Unit of Government pursuant to the 1970 Illinois
Constitution, Article VII, Section 6; and,

WHEREAS, pursuant to its home rule power the County of Cook may exercise any power and perform any
function relating to its government and affairs, including the power to regulate for the protection of the
public health, safety, morals and welfare; and,

WHEREAS, Cook County Police Of?cers and those public servants under the direction of the Cook
County Sheriff strive to maintain a courteous and professional demeanor when dealing with the public, in
addition to and including individuals detained in Cook County Jail and the Juvenile Temporary Detention
Center; and,

WHEREAS, the Cook County Sheriff trains his of?cers to select the appropriate level of force based on a
subject?s actions, and to modify their selection of options as the subject offers less or greater resistance;
and,

WHEREAS, choke holds are largely ineffective and create the potential for a subject to panic and react
with greater resistance than he or she otherwise might deploy during an of?cer restraint; and,

WHEREAS, the children in the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center, due to their ages, are not as likely to
appreciate the consequences of impulsively resistant behavior in the same manner as an adult inmate; and,

WHEREAS, the President and Board of Commissioners of Cook County intend to codify the Cook County
Sheriff?s commitment to a progressive and reasonable escalation and de-escalation of of?cer-applied force
into the County Codes and Ordinances, and further intend to expressly prohibit the use of choke holds by
Cook County police of?cers as well as any private security personnel employed by Cook County;

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED BY THE PRESIDENT AND BOARD OF
COMMISSIONERS OF COOK COUNTY: 

SECTION 1. The above recitals are expressly incorporated herein and made part hereof as though fully set
forth herein.

SECTION 2. Chapter 46-38 of the Cook County Code of Ordinances concerning ?Law Enforcement? is
hereby enacted as follows:

Sec. 46-38 Policy on Use of Force- choke holds prohibited
Members of the Cook County Sheriffs Department and Cook County police of?cers as well as any
private security personnel employed by Cook County shall use an amount of force reasonably
necessary based on the totality of the circumstances to perform a lawful task, effect an arrest,
overcome resistance, control a subject, or protect themselves or others from injury. Circumstances
that may govern the reasonableness of using a particular force option include but are not limited to:

(1) whether the subject poses an immediate threat to the safety of of?cers or others; and

(2) whether the subject is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by ?ight.

(b)After gaining control of a subject, members of the Cook County Sheriff?s Department and Cook
County police of?cers as well as any private security personnel employed by Cook County shall:

(1)Avoid sitting, kneeling, or standing on a subject?s chest, which may result in chest compression,
thereby reducing the subject?s ability to breathe;

(2)Position the subject in a manner to allow free breathing and, whenever feasible, avoid placing the
subject on his or her stomach;

(3)Monitor an arrestee until transported to a secure location; and,

(4)Seek medical attention for an arrestee who has injuries or illnesses consistent with
Sheriff? 3 Department Policy Directives.

(c)No Cook County Sheriff? 5 Department, Cook County police of?cer or private security personnel
employed by Cook County shall apply a choke hold in the performance of his or her duties unless
faced with a situation in which the use of deadly force is justi?ed under applicable law. A choke
hold shall include but is not limited to, any pressure to the throat or windpipe, which may prevent or
hinder breathing or reduce intake of air.

(d)For purposes of this section the following terms shall have the following meaning:
?Police of?cer? means any person who by virtue of his or her public employment is vested by law with a
duty to maintain public order or make arrests for offenses, whether that duty extends to all offenses or is
limited to speci?c offenses. ?Private security personnel? means a person or persons acting in the capacity of
his or her employment by a private contractor who engages in the business of providing a private security
of?cer, watchman, patrol, guard dog, canine odor detection or a similar service by any other title, or name
on a contractual basis for another person, ?rm, corporation, or other entity for a fee or other consideration
and performing one or more of the following functions:

(l)The prevention or detection of intrusion, entry, theft, vandalism, abuse, ?re or trespass on
Cook County governmental property or private property within jurisdiction of Cook County law

enforcement;

(2)The prevention, observation or detection of any unauthorized activity on Cook County governmental
property or private property within jurisdiction of Cook County law enforcement;

(3)The protection of persons authorized to be on the premises of the person, ?rm, or other entity for which
the security contractor contractually provides security services;

(4)The prevention of the misappropriation of the concealment of goods, money, stocks, bonds,
notes, documents or papers;

(5)The control, regulation, or direction of the movement of the public for the time speci?cally
required for the protection of the property owned or controlled by the client;
