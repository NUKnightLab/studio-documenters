REPORT FROM THE CHAIR
“I just want to say how glad I am that Wayne County is welcoming, and has
welcomed the members of the National Organization of Black County Officials, which I
am on the board of. It is a non-profit organization under the NACO realm, so there are
two organizations; there is NACO, there is NABCO and there is NOBCO. So NABCO,
National Association of Black County Officials, is the membership piece and that was
the organization that I was the president of for two years. NOBCO is our 501(c)(3) arm,
non-profit, and every year, and this is our 35th economic development conference. I am
happy to have it here in Wayne County. We had it here 6 years ago in Wayne County,
and it was so wonderful to see so many commissioners who had never been to Detroit,
never been to Wayne County and they were just blown away 6 years ago about how
wonderful our Detroit River is, how our downtown was, and that was 6 years ago. So I
164

 am happy that we have, today, hundreds more people coming from across the country
to see our beautiful county. So, they’re at the Renaissance Center, as we speak, I left
them to come over here and chair the meeting. We did have a wonderful opportunity to
have U.S. Senator Cory Booker speak to us this morning and he was a wonderful
speaker and got us revved up for the conference. On Friday, we are going to have
Senator Amy Klobuchar speak to us during our lunchtime. So I am just happy that we,
as a national organization, have national presidential candidates coming down, and we
have wonderful speakers throughout the conference on topics as the census, criminal
justice reform, just getting to those issues that all of us, no matter where we are
commissioner, across the country, these issues are near and dear to us. It is our
responsibility to, as commissioners, to make sure that we are leading on those different
topics. So, I just wanted to make you all aware and then of course invite you to all of
our activities. I think I have sent the agenda out and everyone is more than welcomed to
participate for the next three days as we celebrate and we learn and we fellowship with
one another right here in Wayne County. So, just want to bring that to everyone’s
attention.”

UNFINISHED BUSINESS
The Acting Clerk advised that there was no Unfinished Business.

PRESENTATION OF PETITIONS, ORDINANCES AND RESOLUTIONS
Pursuant to the Wayne County Commission Rules of Procedure, a Resolution of
Memoriam was read into the record in memory of former Wayne County Supervisor Judge
Damon Keith. The resolution is listed below:
JUDGE DAMON J. KEITH
WHEREAS, it is with great respect and admiration that that we, the members of the Wayne
County Commission, solemnly pause and reflect on the life of JUDGE DAMON J. KEITH, an outstanding jurist, a
giant in the struggle for equality and a mentor to generations of Michigan civic leaders, who passed away April 28,
2019, at age 96; and
WHEREAS, JUDGE DAMON J. KEITH, born July 4, 1922, in Detroit, Michigan, and served in the
U.S. Army during World War II before earning his law degree from Howard University. He received a master’s of
law degree from Wayne State University in 1956 and served on the Wayne County Board of Supervisors,
predecessor to the Wayne County Commission, before becoming co-chairman of the newly formed Michigan Civil
Rights Commission in 1963; and
WHEREAS, JUDGE DAMON J. KEITH was nominated to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern
District of Michigan by President Lyndon Johnson in 1967 and would order the U.S. government to cease
wiretapping defendants without court approval in 1971, a decision considered key to the Watergate scandal
involving President Richard Nixon; and

165

 WHEREAS, JUDGE DAMON J. KEITH was named chief judge of the U.S. District Court for the
Eastern District of Michigan in 1975 and was nominated to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth District
in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter and would obtain senior status in 1995, continuing to write opinions, including
a 2002 opinion rebuking the U.S. government for closing deportation hearings to the public; and
WHEREAS, throughout his career, JUDGE DAMON J. KEITH earned praise not only for his
decisions desegregating public schools, ending examples of systemic racism in U.S. communities and erasing
color barriers in the public sector, but also for his personal integrity and the legacy he left through the Damon J.
Keith Center for Civil Rights at the Wayne State University Law School;
Now therefore be it
RESOLVED, that on this 2nd day of May 2019, that this resolution be spread at length upon the
journal of this day’s proceedings to endure as a lasting record of Wayne County’s respect for the life of JUDGE
DAMON J. KEITH with deep appreciation for everything he accomplished in making this county, this nation and
the world a better place for all to enjoy.
