BOARD AGENDA

March 22, 2017

The contract-specific goal set on this contract was zero.
The Chief Procurement Officer concurs.
Summary: This increase and first of two (2), one (1) year renewal options will allow the Cook County
Assessor’s Office to continue to satisfy the statutory requirements set forth in 35 ILCS 200/12-20 and
715 ILCS 10/1 which require assessments to be published at the same time for the North and South
suburban townships. Cook County Suburban Publishers, Inc. can publish the North and South suburban
townships under one umbrella.

This contract will also allow the Cook County Clerk’s Office to continue to satisfy the statutory
requirements set forth in Article 12 of the Election Code, 10 ILCS 5/12-1 et seq. which requires the Cook
County Clerk’s Office to place notices in a minimum of two newspapers for each suburban municipality
in the election jurisdiction on the same day and for the same duration of time. If multiple vendors are
involved, there could be a scenario where some newspapers in certain municipalities have different
publication dates.
This would result in a loss of coordination of the notices and possible confusion
among the voters. Therefore, it is necessary to have one source that can publish notices in all election
municipalities on the same day.
Cook County Suburban Publishers, Inc. can provide the necessary
geographical coverage and guarantee that notices are placed in the correct papers on the same day.
This contract was awarded as a Sole Source procurement pursuant to Section 34-139 of the Cook County
Procurement Code.
