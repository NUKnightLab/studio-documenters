OCHKEE KIM, in the course of her employment as a Nurse for Stroger Hospital of Cook
County sustained accidental injuries on January 17, 1997. Payment of a $91,756.27
decision (Nos. 97-WC-22961 and 98-WC-18708) was approved at the November 4, 2004
subcommittee meeting and subsequently paid out in December 2004. At that time, the
matter was pending on review in the Circuit Court, and the Circuit Court subsequently
affirmed the decision. The Workers’ Compensation Commission had reversed the
Arbitrator’s denial of compensation. The Workers’ Compensation Commission had
awarded TTD, medical expenses, and permanency plus interest under Section 19(n). At
the time, the interest rate under Section 19(n) was 2.16%, and interest on the award was
calculated based on that rate from the date of the Workers’ Compensation Commission’s
decision to the time of payout, for a total payout of $91,756.27.
Petitioner has filed a Petition for additional interest under Aper v. National Union Electric
Corp., 165 Ill. App. 3d 482 (1988), which held that if a review to the Circuit Court is filed,
interest should be calculated from the date of the Arbitrator’s decision using 735 ILCS 5/21304. Under Aper and subsequent cases, interest on the award was substantially
underpaid. The additional interest due, calculated from the date of the Workers’
Compensation Commission’s decision, rather than the date of the Arbitrator’s decision is
$7,410.30. State's Attorney, Richard A. Devine, is submitting additional interest on the
decision in the amount of $7,410.30 and recommends its payment.
