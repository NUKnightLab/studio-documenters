 EXPLANATION
In March 2008, the Board of Commissioners approved an award of an agreement with Integrys
Energy Services, Inc. for the supply and delivery of natural gas to various CHA residential sites
and facilities for a base period of two (2) years. The current contract will expire on March 31,
2010.
The Natural Gas Supply and Delivery Agreement offers CHA the opportunity to purchase its gas
needs at wholesale instead of retail, and enables the CHA to hedge against potential market price
fluctuations through use of multi-tiered price/risk management options.
An extension of the agreement would allow the CHA to continue to purchase natural gas
supplies from non-utility sources and thereby reduce the CHA’s overall gas costs. The
Department of Housing and Urban Development has historically offered incentives to housing
authorities that purchase their natural gas supplies at wholesale costs (wellhead) that are less than
what the local retail utility would ordinarily charge. It is critical that the CHA continue to reduce
its energy costs through gas purchases made under the wellhead program.
Under Contract #8014 natural gas is supplied and delivered to multiple CHA family and senior
developments. The following table shows the usage and cost of natural gas in 2008 and 2009:
Year
2008
2009
TOTAL

Usage (therms)
14,601,540
12,000,990
26,602,530

Cost
$12,910,760
$ 7,679,278
$20,590,038

CHA’s aggregate natural gas usage in 2009 was 17.7% less than in 2008 for the portfolio
properties subject to the agreement, and the cost was approximately 40.5% less over that same
term. The decreases in the CHA’s natural gas consumption and costs were primarily due to
price/risk management strategies, building consolidations and closures, and energy-efficient
retrofits.
Based on the historical consumption and management practices, the anticipated annual usage for
the period of April 1, 2010 through March 31, 2011 is projected at 12,334,819 therms. Based on
proposed pricing for the period, the projected cost to CHA would be $8,440,427.00.
Based on the foregoing, it is in the best interest of the CHA that the Board of Commissioners
authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to exercise the first one-year option with
Integrys Energy Services, Inc. for the supply and delivery of natural gas to various CHA
residential sites and facilities in an amount not-to-exceed $8,440,427.00.
