7. Progress Report on Permit Application – Announcement
OLD TOWN TRIANGLE DISTRICT
227 W. Menomonee St.
ANNOUNCED:

WARD 43

Ten years ago, in June 2003, the Commission, following a public hearing, issued
a final disapproval relating to the applicant's proposal to raise the building
located at 227 W. Menomonee by 4 feet, and to demolish the adjoining building
located at 231 W. Menomonee. The applicant did not appeal either of the final
disapprovals. Subsequently, the applicant applied for a permit under application
number 100478815 for the same scope of work. This permit application was
preliminarily disapproved by the Commission on April 4, 2013.
The Commission’s counsel has advised that the Commission is not required to
proceed to a public hearing regarding permit application 100478815 because the
applicant is precluded from re-litigating matters decided in the 2003 final
disapproval.
In accordance with Article I-A-2a of the Landmark’s Ordinance, the Chairman
decides all points of order and procedure and concurred with the opinion of the
Commission's counsel. Therefore, the Commission will not proceed with a
public hearing regarding permit application 100478815. However, the applicant
still has the opportunity to submit a new application (or revise the existing
application) to conform to the conditions of approval established by the Permit
Review Committee at their February 7, 2013 meeting.

8. Adjournment
There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned at 1:29 p.m.
Motioned by Smith. Approved unanimously. (6-0)
