RE: Resolution to declare October as National Disability Employment Awareness Month in

the City of Detroit

The Honorable Council Member Scott Benson requested that the Legislative Policy Division
draft a resolution to declare October as National Disability Employment Awareness Month in the

City of Detroit.

Attached, please ?nd our draft of the resolution.

Please con-tact us if we can be of any further assistance.

BY COUNCIL MEMBER SCOTT BENSON

Resolution affirming support to declare October 2019 and every year after, National Disability
Employment Awareness Month

WHEREAS, The mission of the Detroit City Council is to promote the economic, cultural, and physical
welfare of Detroit?s citizens through Charter-mandated legislative functions; and

WHEREAS, The purpose of National Disability Employment Awareness Month (NDEAM) is a campaign to
educate the public about disability employment issues and celebrate the many contributions of
America's workers with disabilities, and

WHEREAS, The history of National Disability Employment Awareness Month traces back to 1945 when
Congress enacted a law declaring the first week in October each year "National Employ the Physically
Handicapped Week." In 1962, the word "physically" was removed to acknowledge the employment
needs and contributions of individuals with all types of disabilities. In 1988, Congress expanded the
week to a month and changed the name to National Disability Employment Awareness Month; and

WHEREAS, People with disabilities are unemployed at TWICE the rate of people without disabilities.
increasing the labor participation for every American who is willing and able to work, will serve to
reduce the local unemployment rate and strengthen the local tax base; and

WHEREAS, In this spirit, the Detroit City Council acknowledges the efforts of Detroit employers and
workplaces that welcome the talents of people with disabilities and recognize their contributions as an
essential component of an inclusive community; and NOW THEREFORE BE IT

RESOLVED, The Detroit City Council is proud to be a part of this year's National Disability Employment
Awareness Month, by promoting this year's theme "The Right Talent, Right Now during October and
throughout the year, AND BE IT FURTHER

RESOLVED, That the Detroit City Council hereby designate the month of October, in this year, 2019, and

every year, thenceforth as National Disability Employment Awareness Month in the City of Detroit;
AND BE IT FINALLY

RESOLVED, That copies of this resolution be forwarded to the office of the City Clerk, and the Mayor.
