 GENERAL BACKGROUND
The Chicago Housing Authority’s (“CHA”) information technology infrastructure is critical to
daily operations in its ability to support planned and existing application systems. The CHA
utilizes Sun hardware and software to support internal/external communications and the CHA’s
essential operating functions. Every CHA computer is linked together via Sun hardware and
software components. Critical core applications, i.e., Lawson (ERP), Yardi, and the Relocation
Management Tracking System, would be adversely affected should the Sun components cease to
be operational, and the CHA would be unable to execute a timely recovery as a result. It would
be imprudent not to assure maintenance agreements remain in place as a preventative precaution
to avoid the risk of service disruption or impairment.
The CHA issued Invitation for Bid (“IFB”) # 01441 on February 17, 2006. This IFB was
advertised on February 17, 2006 and February 20, 2006 in the Chicago Sun-Times, and the week
of February 17, 2006 in The Defender and El Dia. This IFB competitively solicited qualified
firms and/or individuals who could provide Sun Maintenance Services to the CHA.
On March 21, 2006 at 11:00 a.m. CST eight (8) bid proposals were received and opened by
CHA’s Department of Procurements and Contracts. Two (2) bid proposals were deemed nonresponsive because the vendors, Technology Consortium and Smart Technology, did not bid on
all items in the maintenance list. Fastech, Inc., proposed the lowest total price of $251,308.16.
Upon recommendation of the evaluation panel, the CHA entered into a maintenance contract
with Fastech, Inc. for Sun Maintenance Services. The Contract was awarded at the firm fixed
price of $251,308.16 for a two (2) year base term, with the option of three, one (1) year term
extensions, at a firm, fixed price of $128,181.22, $132,196.48, and $132,196.48 for each of the
respective successive option years.
Based on the foregoing, it is in the best interest of the CHA to authorize the Chief Executive
Officer or his designee, to exercise the third one (1) year option of the Contract with Fastech for
the period of June 1, 2010 through May 31, 2011, for an amount of $132,196.48 to provide Sun
Maintenance Services.
The Contract’s new aggregate compensation amount will be
$643,882.34.
