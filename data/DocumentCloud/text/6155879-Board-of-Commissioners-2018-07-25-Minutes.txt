Project Name: Beverly Road Bicycle Tollway Crossing and Road Resurfacing
Applicant: Village of Hoffman Estates
Type: Roadway
Amount: $60,000
This grant funds preliminary engineering to design a combination off-street I on-shoulder bicycle facility
on Beverly Road to cross the Jane Addams Tollway (1-90). Within the project limits of Prairie Stone
Parkway and Beacon Pointe Drive, the scope of work includes resurfacing Beverly Road. The lack
of Tollway crossings for bicyclists and pedestrians was a common concern heard from the public when
the Village developed its Bicycle Plan. Beverly Road is one of the key remaining roads which cross
the Tollway without such accommodations. The pavement surface conditions on Beverly Road indicate
a need for resurfacing. Combining the roadway rehabilitation with the bicycle work in one project is
an efficient and cost-effective way to address both of these issues.
The proposed scope of work for this proposal is preliminary engineering for bicycle facilities on Beverly
Road to cross the Illinois Tollway and resurfacing of the road within the project limits. Phase I will
evaluate options for new accommodations on Beverly Road to assist bicyclists in crossing the Jane
Addams Tollway (1-90). While lower cost alternatives will be explored, the presumption is a barrier
separated two-way path on the west side of Beverly Road will be preferred. The roadway and shoulder
surface conditions between Beacon Pointe Drive and Prairie Stone Parkway ind icate the need for
resurfacing along with areas of curb and shoulder to be repaired. Phase I services of a consultant will
be used to complete plans for this work and will follow federal processes and shall be designated as

addressed in the early 1980s, at this time. The roadway is currently at a higher elevation than the
sidewalk, on the north side of the right-of-way, which results in flooding of the parkway and sidewalk
area. The right-of-way for the roadway is only thirty-three feet wide, with the south portion of roadway
located on property owned by the Cook County Forest Preserve District. The Village is working with the
Forest Preserve District to reach an agreement to allow for a continuance of the existing roadway

limits.
This proposed study will include but not be limited to the following research components: traffic analysis
(both present and projected); interchange spacing on 1-294 and traffic impact at other interchanges in the
vicinity; types of possible interchange configurations; impact on current road/highway infrastructure in
adjacent areas; environmental and noise impacts; preliminary right-of-way identification; cost projections;
possible funding sources and partnerships; economic development impact, opportunities and projections;
potential challenges to an interchange--economic, engineering, environmental, legal, etc. The study will
be led by Cook County on behalf of Robbins and Crestwood and shall be designated as Section: l 8IICRD-08-ES M FT.

the Sauk Village LogistiCenter, which is located east of Cottage Grove Avenue, north of Sauk Trail,
west of IL 394, and south of the CN Railway in the Village of Sauk Village, Illinois. The roadway
improvements will expand the road network within the LogistiCenter to access vacant, developable
parcels located east of Mark Collins Drive, as well as potentially provide new ingress and egress to
the LogistiCenter from Cottage Grove Avenue. The rail improvements will extend the existing industrial
track within the LogistiCenter to create a new loop track and storage tracks serving the vacant parcels
east of Mark Collins Drive, as well as south of Winpak Way. The rail improvements will include new
left-hand and right-hand turnouts from the CN mainline, as well as a new pocket track at the northern end
of the loop.

types of uses in the South Deerfield area, surveys and/or interviews with area residents and employees
with recommendations for commuting options for residents, guests, and employees based on data
collected. Particular attention will be focused on people who live in the area, and who work at times
not served by existing transit service. The southern section of the Village of Deerfield, which had
primarily consisted of office and commercial uses, is seeing additional types of land uses. There are
two hotels with 355 rooms and 240 senior apartment units in the study area with up to 500 more apartments
proposed. Existing Pace transit service is primarily designed to provide reverse commute service from
the Lake-Cook and Braeside Metra Stations on weekday mornings and to those stations on weekday

Project Name: Western Springs Metra Station Pedestrian Underpass Improvements
Applicant: Village of Western Springs
Type: Transit
Amount: $200,000
This grant funds the construction of the Pedestrian Underpass Improvements project to provide a safe
pathway for commuters and residents to cross the Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) railroad tracks.
This underpass will provide a new access point to the Metra station and will also fill in sidewalk gaps
in the area and add lighting to create a safe environment for users. This project is a priority for the
Village due to fatal accidents at the railroad crossing. A pedestrian underpass would eliminate the need
for pedestrians to cross at grade and better connect the Village. In addition, the Invest in Cook program
will help the Village leverage federal Surface Transportation Program funding to construct the proposed
Pedestrian Underpass Improvements.

The proposed underpass will connect pedestrian traffic between Hillgrove Avenue and Burlington
Avenue, through a grade separation of the BNSF railroad tracks. Standard precast concrete bridges will
be used for each track (3-tracks) supported by H-piles. After the bridge is in place the underpass will
be excavated beneath the bridge ("top-down method"). The current location identified for the project will
not require any stairs or significant ADA ramping. Adjacent retaining walls would be minimal in height
and shall be designated as Section: 18-IICTR-O 1-GS MFT.

Wages of Regular Employees Account as a result of six positions within the Department of
Administrative Hearings recently certified by AFSCME Union Local 3696. The salaries of these positions
have been increased to union wage scale plus back pay from the date of certification. The Department is
also requesting an additional $5,000.00 transfer of funds for its Deputy Director position which shall
replace our currently funded Legislative Coordinator position. The Department is requesting a transfer of
funds for the difference in pay scale between the two job classifications. The Legislative Coordinator
position will no longer be a funded position within the Department of Administrative Hearings.

To Account(s): 501010, $40,000.00
Total Amount of Transfer: $40,000.00
On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
Acct# 540135 - Working Capital Maintenance of Data Processing Equipment was identified as a source
of transferred funds because it was $35,000.00 over funded due to a chargeback expense attributed to
Administrative Hearings in error. Acct#-520830-Professional Services was also used as a source of funds
because it was the only other account with sufficient funds available to facilitate the transfer. There are
no other accounts with sufficient available funds to facilitate this transfer.
Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from.
None.
If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
Acct# 540135 was originally budgeted for chargeback expenses attributed to Administrative Hearings
from Bureau of Technology. $35,000.00 in chargebacks were attributed to Administrative Hearings in

WHEREAS, Cook County has set a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions 80% by the year 2050; and
WHEREAS, PACE is an economic development initiative with environmental benefits that lowers the cost

Municipal District (Maywood), 2) the Fifth Municipal District (Bridgeview), and 3) the Sixth Municipal
District (Markham).
The purpose of the Suburban Municipal Districts DCSEP is to increase the number of suburban drug
court participants who graduate successfully from the program and achieve stable recovery and affect the
long-term health and safety needs of these individuals and their communities. Participants in the program
include adult men and women (age 18 and older) who are arrested/charged with new non-violent,
drug-related felony offenses and are diagnosed with substance use disorders. The majority of participants
are from minority communities.
Project funds are dedicated mostly for community-based case management and treatment services. The
remainder are used for staff, fringe benefits, supplies, training and travel.

procurement process that allows facility owners to complete a multitude of repair/maintenance and

The County is under no obligation to expend the amount requested, and is only obligated to pay JOC

A RESOLUTION OPPOSING THE REDUCTION OF AIR AND WATER POLLUTION
STANDARDS IN WISCONSIN FOR THE PROPOSED FOXCONN DEVELOPMENT
WHEREAS, Foxconn Technology Group (“Foxconn”) is a manufacturer of computer, communication and
electronics; and
WHEREAS, Foxconn is constructing a fabrication plant in Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin to manufacture
LCD glass panels. Mount Pleasant is in Racine County, Wisconsin; and
WHEREAS, the proposed plant is sited at the headwaters of the Des Plaines River and is located
approximately 50 miles from the border of Cook County; and
WHEREAS, Cook County shares the Des Plaines Watershed Region, and our water and air resources are
all interconnected; and
WHEREAS, the State of Wisconsin has passed legislation that waives environmental regulations for the
Foxconn plant; and
WHEREAS, the legislation allows Foxconn to fill 26 acres of wetlands with dredged materials without an
Environmental Impact Study or input from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers; and
WHEREAS, the United States Environmental Protection Agency exempted Racine County, Wisconsin
from air quality requirements for ozone, allowing Foxconn to avoid having to install stringent pollution
control equipment; and
WHEREAS, the Foxconn plant will divert approximately 7 million gallons of water from Lake Michigan
a day; and
WHEREAS, the greatest natural resource Cook County has is Lake Michigan and the proposed plant will
adversely affect that resources; and
WHEREAS, there has been no stormwater management plan for the proposed plant, even though the plant
will encompass thousands of acres of farmland; and
WHEREAS, the Des Plaines River has had significant flooding and removing permeable land at the
headwaters of the River will likely increase the downstream flood risk; and
WHEREAS, without a proper study of all potential environmental impacts of the plant, it is unknown if
there will be adverse effects to the environment and population of Cook County.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County call on the
State of Wisconsin and the United States Environmental Protection Agency to require the Foxconn
Development to comply with all applicable environmental regulations in the construction and operation of
its proposed plant at Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin; and

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County supports the Illinois
Attorney General, Illinois General Assembly and Illinois agencies in taking whatever actions possible to
protect Cook County and the State of Illinois against the loss of water resources, potential flooding, and
other ecological impacts from this development; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a copy of this Resolution shall be provided to the Governor of
Wisconsin, the Director of the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, the Governor of Illinois, the

WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners has adopted a Real Property Assessment
Classification 6b that provides an applicant a reduction in the assessment level for an abandoned industrial
facility; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Classification System for Assessment defines abandoned property as
buildings and other structures that, after having been vacant and unused for at least 24 continuous months,
have been purchased for value by a purchaser in whom the seller has no direct financial interest; and
WHEREAS, in the instance where the property does not meet the definition of abandoned property, the
municipality or the Board of Commissioners, may determine that special circumstances may exist that
justify finding that the property is abandoned for purpose of Class 6b; and
WHEREAS, in the case of abandonment of less than 24 months and purchase for value, by a purchaser in
whom the seller has no direct financial interest, the County may determine that special circumstances justify
finding the property is deemed abandoned; and
WHEREAS, Class 6b requires the validation by the County Board of the shortened period of qualifying
abandonment in cases where the facility has been abandoned for less than 24 consecutive months upon
purchase for value; and
WHEREAS, the municipality states the Class 6b is necessary for development to occur on this specific
real estate. The municipal Resolution cites the qualifications of this property to meet the definition of
abandoned with special circumstances; and
WHEREAS, industrial real estate is normally assessed at 25% of its market value, qualifying industrial
real estate eligible for the Class 6b can receive a significant reduction in the level of assessment from the
date that new construction or rehabilitation has been completed, or in the case of abandoned property from
the date of substantial re-occupancy. Properties receiving Class 6b will be assessed at 10% of the market
value for 10 years, 15% for the 11th year and 20% in the 12th year; and
