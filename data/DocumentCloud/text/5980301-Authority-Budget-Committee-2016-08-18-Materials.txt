an introduction to the FFY15 plan. He described FFY10, FFY11, and FFY12 funds

 Department of Innovation and Technology Director Hardik Bhatt identifying ISE
implementation as a recommendation of the Illinois Commission on Criminal Justice and

Program
Associate Director Givens called attention to the memo dated May 12, 2016, regarding
the FFY13 National Instant Criminal Background Check System Act Reporting
Improvement Program (NARIP) plan adjustment. He said that since the original
designation of $1.5 million was made to the Illinois State Police (ISP) in 2013, the
program’s focus shifted. He said staff recommended rescinding the unspent $1.5 million
NARIP designation to ISP and re-designating $1,403,100 to the Illinois Department of
Human Services (IDHS) to enhance its data collecting partnership with ISP.

the SFY16 Safe from the Start (SFS) plan. He said that while the Authority does not have
active SFS grants at this time, grant activities are continuing, and staff continues to report
the numbers of those served by the program to the Governor’s Office. The purpose of
making the designations without an appropriation was to ensure that when an
appropriation became available, staff could forward grant agreements to the agencies in a
timely manner.

Greene seconded the motion and the motion passed by unanimous voice vote.

He described FFY13 and FFY14 funds recently returned to the Authority and
recommended designations.
Authority Program Supervisor Ron Reichgelt, in response to a question by Ms.
Campanelli, said that the reason some VOCA grantees did not 25-percent increase was
that staff were instructed to identify programs that were not in good standing and make
the appropriate funding recommendations. In any case, these designations will be the last
for all programs under the current VOCA plan.

Notices of Funding Opportunity
Illinois Partnerships to Reduce Violent Crime Notice of Funding Opportunity Designation
Requests
At the May 12, 2016, Budget Committee meeting, the committee set aside $800,000 in FFY14
funds to support the Illinois Partnerships to Reduce Violent Crime Notice of Funding
Opportunity (NOFO). The goals is to reduce violent crime and strengthen the relationship
between law enforcement and communities by completing the Problem-Oriented Policing
Scanning, Analysis, Response and Assessment (SARA) process, building local research and
evaluation capacity, and implementing procedural justice and focused deterrence. Initial grants
will be awarded for the assessment process. Subsequent grants will be awarded for training and
implementation.
Having reviewed and scored the NOFO submissions, staff recommends the following

Medication Assisted Treatment for Opioid Addiction Notice of Funding Opportunity
Funding Request
At the January 19, 2016, meeting, the Budget Committee approved the use of federal fiscal year
2013-2015 RSAT local funding for a competitive NOFO to select a county-level jail or detention
center to implement a Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) program to address opioid
addiction. At that time, it was anticipated that RSAT local funds could provide one case
management program that would link inmates to insurance coverage and post-release MAT
substance abuse treatment over a two-year period.
Since that meeting, staff have researched MAT programs, participated in RSAT training and
technical assistance webinars on opioid treatment, and attended a MAT-focused national RSAT
conference. The information gathered indicates that provision of these transitional case
management services alone have a low long-term impact of opioid addiction and recidivism. The
most effective MAT interventions include the long-acting opioid antagonist medication
Naltrexone and ongoing substance abuse treatment and support.

 JAG FFY10, FFY11, FFY12, FFY13, FFY14, FFY15
August 18, 2016

Model programs include three components:




Jail-based substance abuse treatment.
Transitional case management services to actively link offenders to Affordable Care Act,
Medicaid, or private insurance coverage, as well as certified MAT treatment providers
and community-based substance abuse treatment.
Post-release probation and substance abuse treatment.

Congress is currently considering the President’s request for $1.1 billion in federal funding to
expand opioid treatment, particularly MAT treatment programs, and as much as $28 million
could be made available to Illinois to expand health center capacity to treat opioid disorders in
underserved communities. While greater availability of community opioid treatment would
enhance access to services for offenders post-release, targeted treatment for incarcerated
populations is needed. The requested designation would help fill the gap in this expanded opioid
treatment plan.
The FFY13 JAG award will expire September 30, 2017, with the possibility of additional 12
months. Currently, $557,786 in JAG FFY13 local formula set-aside funds are available.
Designation of these funds to supplement the RSAT Medication Assisted Treatment for Opioid
Addiction NOFO will allow funding of at least two comprehensive MAT programs in
jurisdictions that did not receive direct JAG local awards from the U.S. Bureau of Justice
Assistance.

RE:

FFY16 National Forensic Sciences Improvement Act Plan
Introduction

The Authority expects receipt of the FFY16 NFSIA award to Illinois in the amount of
$313,276 by September 30, 2016, however, staff requests permission to make
designations at this time in anticipation of these funds in an effort to expedite their
expenditure. After deducting $21,677 for administrative costs there would be $291,599
available for grants. Staff asks permission, if the FFY16 award is less than expected, to
make across-the-board reductions in the recommended designation amounts detailed
below consistent with the difference between the expected and actual FFY16 award
amounts. Staff will update the Budget Committee on any designation changes related to
this item at our next Budget Committee meeting.
Recommended Designations
NFSIA funds principally are used to purchase new lab equipment and support required
proficiency testing, lab accreditation, and conference travel. In addition, these funds
support staff overtime and contractual toxicology testing to help labs meet the demand
for testing.
Staff proposes using FFY16 NFSIA funding to support ongoing improvements at the
Cook County Medical Examiner’s Office and nine crime labs across Illinois. These
improvements will be made through agreements with the DuPage County Crime Lab
(DuPage), the Northeastern Illinois Regional Crime Lab (NIRCL), the Office of the Cook
County Medical Examiner (CCME) and the Illinois State Police (ISP).
Staff recommends the following NFSIA FFY16 designations.

RE:

FFY15 Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) Plan Introduction

This memo introduces the FFY15 Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) Plan.
PREA was, “enacted to address the problem of sexual abuse of persons in the custody of
U.S. correctional agencies. PREA calls for Federal, State, and local corrections systems
to have a zero-tolerance policy regarding prison rape (as defined by PREA) in prisons,
jails, police lock-ups, and other confinement facilities (National Institute of Justice,
2014).”

Recommended Designation
In 2017, the Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC) plans to open the Joliet
Treatment Center, an adult multiple security (including maximum) residential treatment
unit for mentally ill offenders. One issue identified in facility renovation was the lack of
sufficient security cameras for surveillance, security, and prevention efforts. IDOC seeks
to improve security and prevention at the facility by increasing surveillance capabilities.
The Authority’s FFY15 PREA award is $119,942. Staff recommends designating these
funds to the IDOC for its Inmate Sexual Assaults – Prevention and Intervention Program
for the purchase of security cameras and peripheral equipment
Staff will be available at the meeting to answer any questions.
See the attached Grant Recommendation Report for further detail.

RE:

FFY13-16 Residential Substance Abuse Treatment

Designation Reduction
Due to a declining number of youth in the program, the Illinois Department of Juvenile Justice
(IDJJ) requested that the Illinois Youth Center (IYC)-Warrenville Residential Substance
Abuse Treatment (RSAT) be terminated six months early. Consequently, staff recommends
reducing the original FFY15 designation of $23,934 by $11,967 and making those funds
available for future programming.
Recommended Designations
The Authority expects receipt of the FFY16 RSAT award to Illinois in the amount of $334,121
by September 30, 2016, however, staff requests permission to make designations at this time in
anticipation of these funds in an effort to expedite their expenditure. After deducting $27,591 for
administrative costs there would be $306,530 available for grants. Staff asks permission, if the
FFY16 award is less than expected, to make across-the-board reductions in the recommended
designation amounts detailed below consistent with the difference between the expected and
actual FFY16 award amounts. Staff will update the Budget Committee on any designation
changes related to this item at our next Budget Committee meeting.
RSAT Local
RSAT guidelines require that a minimum of 10 percent of each federal award must be used
to support local substance abuse treatment or aftercare services. At the January 19, 2016,
meeting, the Budget Committee approved the use of federal fiscal year 2013-2015 RSAT
local funding in a competitive process to select a county-level jail or detention center to
implement a Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT) program to address opioid addiction.
At that time, it was anticipated that the available RSAT local funds could support 24 months
of case management services to link inmates to insurance coverage and post-release MATsupported substance abuse treatment.

19

 RSAT FFY13, FFY14, FFY15, FFY16
August 18, 2016

Staff has since learned through available research that provision of transitional case
management services have a low long-term impact on opioid addiction and recidivism. The
most effective MAT interventions are those that use the long-acting opioid antagonist
medication Vivitrol and ongoing substance abuse treatment and support.
Model programs have three components, including:
 Jail-based substance abuse treatment.
 Transitional case management services to link formerly incarcerated persons to
Affordable Care Act, Medicaid, or private insurance coverage, as well as certified MAT
treatment provider and community-based substance abuse treatment,
 Post-release probation and substance abuse treatment.
This table summarizes RSAT local dollars that are available in the FFY13-15 awards and the
anticipated FFY16 award:

RSAT State
RSAT funds may only be used for jail and corrections-based assessment and treatment of
incarcerated persons or aftercare programs. Treatment must be provided during the last three
months of a jail sentence or the last six months of a prison sentence. The programs
recommended for funding provide screening and assessment for juvenile males at IYC-St.
Charles, and juvenile drug treatment at IYC-Harrisburg and IYC-St. Charles. RSAT funding
also is recommended to support ongoing implementation of the dual diagnosis treatment
program for female incarcerated persons at the Logan Correctional facility. All treatment and
assessment services are evidence-based and provided through vendor contracts that are
competitively bid and meet all staff education and certification standards.
