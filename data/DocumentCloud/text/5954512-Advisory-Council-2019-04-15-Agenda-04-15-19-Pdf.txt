Please remember that this is a well-attended meeting with many, many people
participating all over the State. To make sure that everyone has the best chance of
hearing the conversation, PLEASE MUTE YOUR PHONE. Do not place the call
on hold. Hold music and other hold tones are very disruptive to the entire group.
During discussions, lease remember to identify yourself, whether you are in person in
Chicago, on the phone or in Springfield. This makes it easier for the note taker and for
those who don’t recognize you voice.
