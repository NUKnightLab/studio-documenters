REQUEST TO DISCHARGE COMMUNICATION NO. 272036 FROM
THE COMMITTEE ON HEALTH AND HOSPITALS

AMENDMENT TO THE COOK COUNTY DEADLY WEAPONS DEALER
CONTROL ORDINANCE (PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT). Sponsored
by Larry Suffredin, County Commissioner; Co-sponsored by John P. Daley and Joan
Patricia Murphy, County Commissioners. Transmitting a Communications, dated June
28, 2005.
The proposed Ordinance updates the current list of assault weapons banned within Cook
County to include new models introduced to circumvent federal, state and local law.
Also, the proposed ordinance substantially expands the definition of "assa ult weapon:
through the imposition of a characteristic-based test. A definition based on the
characteristics of a firearm eliminates one of the weaknesses of the federa l ban on assault
weapons. Finally, the proposed ordinance bans the manufacture, possession and
purchase of large capacity magazines that increase the lethality of firearms.

WH EREAS, Cook County has an ongoing responsibility for protecting the health and safety of its
residents which includes providing a safe place for children with behavioral problems and providing
services that are efficient, equitable and accountable; and
WHEREAS, Cook County is home to the first juvenile court in the world, created in 1899 by Jane
Addams and many local citizen organizations. Cook County has been a leader in juvenile justice for over
100 years and has lead the nation in creating a range of community based alternatives to pre-trial juvenile
detention such as evening reporting centers and home confinement programs; and
WHEREAS, over the past eight years the Cook County Juvenile Temporary Detention Center ("JTDC")
has been plagued with problems and the subject of on-going litigation, investigations and media and
community criticism; and
WHEREAS, given Cook County is under a Federal Consent Decree to improve the administration and
operation of the JTDC it affords us the opportunity to focus our emphasis on the best practices to divert
children from the system and to assess their critical needs and provide supportive services for those
entering the system to reduce the recidivism rate; and
WHEREAS, Cook County has made some progress in changing how we care for children in the JTDC.
Cook County has not implemented the best practices which focus on services that will intervene and
divert children with behavioral problems leading to criminal activity; and
WHEREAS, there is an increase in the number of children with physical, mental and emotional problems
that enter the JTDC coupled with the decrease in resources from State and Federal government, it poses a
serious challenge to balancing the Cook County budget.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and the Cook County Board of
Commissioners change the name of the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center to the Cook County
Juvenile Intervention and Support Center reflecting the change in the mission from detention to
intervention and support for children with behavioral problems; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the President and the Cook County Board of Commissioners
activate and utilize the Cook County Jail Diversion Program taskforce, adopted November 2005 , to
restructure and develop policies and procedures designed to intervene with children having behavioral
problems that could lead to criminal activity and to assess and provide individualized support to children
and families for the purpose of minimizing the child's chances of committing more serious crimes and
entering the adult criminal system.

office to expend the remaining grant funds that were awarded. This grant will provide continued funding
for the Sexual Assault/Domestic Violence Prosecution Coordination Program. This program is, in
essence, the combination of five grants that were once separate. The five separate programs were: Sex
Offender Prosecution Program, Chicago Response, Domestic Violence Resource Center, Domestic
Violence Suburban Coordinator, and Total Response. By combining these programs into one Violence
Against Women program, the State's Attorney's Office is able to better utilize staff and resources to
effectively address the combined issues of sexual assault and domestic violence. In addition, the
combined program allows for more efficient administration and oversight of the various components of
the program. The program dedicates seven (7) assistant state's attorneys, four (4) investigators, two (2)
victim specialists, one (I) resource specialist and one (1) administrative support staff.
This grant requires that the office match one dollar for each three dollars of federal funding. The match
commitment for this program will be salary and fringe benefits of three (3) existing staff as well as a cash
match that will fund two (2) positions.
The authorization to accept the original grant was given on March 1, 2006 by the Cook County Board of
Commissioners in the amount of $832,345.00 with a match of $277,448.00 and an over-match of
$212,426.00.
The Budget Department has reviewed this item, and all requisite documents have been submitted.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: None. Funding period extension: December 6, 2006 through June 30, 2007 .

Commissioner Maldonado, seconded by Commissioner Moreno, moved that the request of the Chief of
the Administrative Services Bureau of the State's Attorney's Office be approved and that the Proper
Officials be authorized to sign on behalf of Cook County. The motion carried unanimously.

MINORITY- AND WOMEN- OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE CONSTRUCTION
INTERIM ORDINANCE
WHEREAS, in 1988, Cook County ("County" ) adopted the Minority- and Women- Owned
Business Enterprises Ordinance establishing an affirmative action program to ensure the full
and equitable participation of minority and female owned bus inesses in the County's
procurement process as both prime Contractors and subcontractors; and
WHEREAS, in 1993, Cook County amended the Minority- and Women- Owned Business
Enterprises Ordinance to include specific minority and women participation goals in

from setting minority and women participation goals in County construction projects; and

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 14, 2006

WHEREAS, the district court's holding was affirmed in Builders Association of Greater
Chicago v. Cook County, 256 F.3d 672 (7th Cir. 2001); and
WHEREAS, in 2005 , the County commissioned a review of the utilization of Minority- and
Women- Owned Business Enterprises ("M/WBE") in its construction contracts since the

Recommendations for Narrowly tailored Remedies for Cook County , Illinois" ("Report");
and
WHEREAS, the Report concluded that there is extensive evidence of discrimination against
Minority-and Women-Owned Business Enterprises in the Chicago area Construction
marketplace, and the participation of Minority- and Women- Owned Business Enterprises in
the County's construction prime contracts and subcontracts is below the availability of such
firms; and
WHEREAS, the Report recommended, among other initiatives, the establishment of an
interim ordinance to remedy the underutilization of Minority- and Women- Owned Business
Enterprises in the County 's construction contracts and ensure that the County is not passively
participating in discrimination against Minority- and Women- Owned Business Enterprises in
the Chicago area construction marketplace; and
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 14, 2006

Vice Chairman Silvestri inquired of Colette Holt, Attorney at Law and MBE/WBE Consultant, whether
the "burden of persuasion" could be quantified.
Ms. Holt replied that it is the usual civil proof standard, rather than the more stringent "clear and
convincing" evidence. Extensive documentation is required by the Contract Compliance Administrator's
Office. There are extensive criteria and schedules involved. The qualified person must own, manage and
control the affairs of the firm.
Vice Chairman Silvestri inquired whether any reciprocal certification agreements exist with the state or
the City of Chicago.
Ms. Holt replied that this is left to the discretion of the County's Office of Contract Compliance.
However, the requirements for certification by the federal government and the City of Chicago are so
stringent, that if you pass those you will most certainly pass the County 's certification process.
Vice Chainnan Silvestri inquired whether the existence of discretion affects the viability of any contracts
in court.
Ms. Holt replied in the negative, noting that the County has modeled itself after the federal regulations.
These regulations contain language concerning discretion, and have been upheld in nine different courts
thus far.
Commissioner Butler inquired how the County would fare if there were a law suit filed against it.
Ms. Holt replied that the drop-off since 2001 was so extreme that the County possesses a good interim
defense. She cautioned, however, that formal evidence gathering would be a wise next step.
Commissioner Butler inquired as to how the eligibility criteria were determined.
Ms. Holt replied that the County's criteria are based on the federal model; also, any individual can contact
the Office of Contract Compliance and present evidence that they have been discriminated against.
Commissioner Butler inquired why people of Portugese and Spanish descent are included in the definition
of " h ispanic."
Ms. Holt replied that the United States Congress and the Department of Labor made this determination,
and it is part of the federal model. Once the County moves beyond an interim ordinance, it can perform a
disparity study to review the definition of "hispanic."

Amendment #1
Commissioner Maldonado, seconded by Commissioner Moreno, moved that Section 34-292,
"Definitions," be amended to exclude language regarding "roads" and "bridges." The motion
carried. Commissioner Butler voted no.
Comm issioner Maldonado clarified that excluding "roads" and " bridges" will allow participation of I 0%
by WBEs and 25% by MBEs.

130

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 14, 2006

Amendment #2
Commissioner Maldonado, seconded by Commissioner Moreno, moved to amend Section 34-292,
"Definitions," to increase the economically disadvantaged personal net worth from $1 million to $2
million. The motion carried.
Commissioner Maldonado noted that this amendment is cons istent with the C ity of Chicago 's policy.

Amendment #3
Commissioner Maldonado, seconded by President Steele, moved to amend Section 34-292 to state
that the term "personal net worth" does not include interest in the applicant or another certified
firm, provided that the other firm is certified by a governmental agency th at meets the County's
eligibility criteria. The motion carried.
President Steele inquired whether one's spouse' s assets are calculated into an applicant's net worth .
Ms. Holt replied in the negative.

Amendment #4
Commissioner Maldonado, seconded by President Steele, moved to delete Section 34-295(k). The
motion carried.
Amendment #5
Commissioner Maldonado, seconded by Commissioner Moreno, moved to amend Section 34-295 to
include the following sentences (to be inserted after the first sentence): "Such challenges shall be
signed and sworn by the individual challenging the eligibility of an applicant for certification or a
certified form . The burden of proof shall rest with the complaintant. Such challenges to eligibility
shall be subject to an appeal. The director shall be the final arbiter of all challenges." Additionally,
Sections "L, M, N, and 0" become " K, L, M, and N." The motion carried.
Ms. Holt clarified that typically in a certification program there is someone higher than the certification
agency to whom one may appeal. Cook County does not have a supervising entity as the DBE Program
does, where appeals go to the Department of Transportation in Washington, D.C. There is no mechanism
to proceed to Circuit Court, nor is there an administrative review. The Illinois Administrative Procedure
would apply.
Commissioner Peraica inquired whether the City of Chicago provides for this language in its fonn.
Ms. Holt replied that she thinks so, and that the Ordinance makes this clarification.
Vice Chairman Silvestri inquired whether this appeals process presents a conflict of interest.
Ms. Holt replied tha t this fo llows the County's usual way of functioning.

Amendment #6
Commissioner Maldonado, seconded by Commissioner Butler, moved to amend Section 34-299 (a)
a nd (t) to include the language, "The utilization p lan is due at the time the bid proposal is due." and
to omit the language, "The utilization plan must be set out in the solicitation documents." The
motion carried.

131

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 14, 2006

Betty Hancock Perry, Contract Compliance Administrator, Office of Contract Compliance, stated that it is
customary that the Office of Contract Compliance allows for an applicant to supply a letter of intent up
until three days after the bid proposal. She requested that this not change.

Commissioner Maldonado, seconded by Commissioner Butler, moved to reconsider Amendment
#6, "to require that the utilization plan be submitted at the time of bid proposal, and the signed
letter of intent be submitted at the time of bid proposal or within three days after such submission."
The motion carried.
Commissioner Peraica inquired as to what is contemplated after the sunset date.
Ms. Holt replied that during the next two years, the expectation is that the County will undertake a full
and complete disparity study on construction contracts. When that study is completed, we will return
with provisions and a new ordinance. She expects to complete this well before the sunset date.

President Steele, seconded by Commissioner Maldonado, moved the approval of Communication
Number 282814, as amended. The motion carried.

Section 34-288. Findings of Discrimination. The President and the Board of Commissioners of the
County of Cook, after considering (i) evidence presented at trial in Builders Association of Greater
Chicago v. City of Chicago, 298 F.Supp.2d 725 (N.D. Ill. 2003) and Northern Contracting, Inc. v. Illinois
Department of Transportation, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19868 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 8, 2005); (ii) County
statistical evidence of continuing discrimination against Blacks, Hispanics, Asians and women in the
County 's contracting awards; (iii) the Report title, "Review of Compelling Evidence of Discrimination
Against Minority-and Women-Owned Business Enterprise in the Chicago Area Construction Industry and
Recommendations for Narrowly Tailored Remedies for Cook County, lllinois;" as well as (iv) anecdotal
evidence of discrimination against minorities and women in the County's construction marketplace; and
(v) receiving and considering written reports, adopts the following findings as a strong basis in evidence
supporting a narrowly tailored, remedial affirmative action program in County construction contracting:
(a) The County of Cook seeks to provide a level playing field and equal access for all prime Contractors
and subcontractors to participate in County construction contracting opportunities;
(b) Since the County's affirmative action program as it relates to construction projects was declared
unconstitutional in 2000, the County has witnessed a drastic reduction in M/WBE construction prime
contract and subcontract participation;
(c) The County has engaged in committee hearings in which the County has heard anecdotal evidence of
discrimination in the construction industry, bas commissioned a study on the levels of M/WBE
participation in County contracts, has reviewed the Report prepared indicating evidence of discrimination
in County construction contracts and has considered the evidence in relevant case law;
(d) In the absence of M/WBE participation goals the County has witnessed a drastic decline in M/WBE
participation in its construction contract below the availability of such firms and thus would be a passive
participant in a discriminatory marketplace without the use of such M/WBE goals;
(e) The County has a compelling interest in preventing discrimination; and

(t) The County desires to reaffirm its commitment to full and fair opportunities for all firms to participate
in its construction contracts.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 14, 2006

(2) The contributions of capital or Expertise by the Socially and Economically Disadvantaged
owner(s) to acquire the ownership interest must be real and substantial. If Expertise is relied upon as part
of a Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner's contribution to acquire ownership, the Expertise
must be of the requisite quality generally recognized in a specialized field, in areas critical to the firm's
operations, indispensable to the firm's potential success, specific to the type of work the firm performs
and documented in the firm's records. The individual whose Expertise is relied upon must have a
commensurate financial investment in the firm.
(c) On ly a firm that is managed and controlled by a Socially and Economically Disadvantaged person(s)
may be certified as a MBE or WBE.

(1) A firm must not be subject to any fonnal or informal restrictions that limit the customary
discretion of the Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s). There can be no restrictions
through corporate charter provisions, by-law provisions, contracts or any other formal or informal devices
that prevent the Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s), without the cooperation or vote of
any non-Socially and Economically Disadvantaged person, from making any business decision of the
firm, including the making of obligations or the dispersing of funds.
(2) The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) must possess the power to direct or
cause the direction of the management and policies of the firm and to make day-to-day as well as longterm decisions on management, policy, operations and work.

particular license or other credential to own and/or control a certain type of firm, then the Socially and
Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) must possess the required license or credential. If state law,
County ordinance or other law regulations or statute does not require that the owner posses the license or

detennining whether the Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) actually controls the firm.
(6) A Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner cannot engage in outside employment or
other business interests that conflict with the management of the firm or prevent the owner from devoting
sufficient time and attention to the affairs of the firm to manage and control its day to day activities.
(d) Only an independent firm may be certified as a MBE or WBE. An independent firm is one whose
viability does not depend on its relationship with another firm. Recognition of an applicant as a separate

and non-Affiliated. ln determining whether an app licant is an independent business, the Director wi ll:

(l) Scrutinize relationships with non-Certified Firms in such areas as personnel, facilities,
equipment, financial and/or bonding support, and other resources.

Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) of the applicant and non-Certified Firms or persons associated
with non-Certified Finns compromi se the appl icant's independence.
(3) Examine the applicant's relationships with non-Certified Firms to determine whether a pattern
of exclusive or primary dealings with non-Certified Firm compromises the applicant's independence.
(4) Consider the consistency of relationships between the app licant and non-Certified Finns with
nonnal industry practice.
(e) An applicant shall be certified on ly for specific types of work in which the Socially and Economically
Disadvantaged owner(s) has the ability and Expertise to manage and control the firm's operations and
work.

(f) The County shall certify the e ligibility of Joint Ventures involving MBEs or WBEs and non-Certified
Firms.
(g) In lieu of conducting its own certifications, the Director by rule may accept formal certifications by
other entities as meeting the requirements of the Program, if the Director determines that the certification
standards of such entities are comparable to those of the County.
(h) The certification status of all MBEs and WBEs shall be reviewed periodical ly by the Office of
Contract Compliance. Failure of the firm to seek recertification by filing the necessary documentation
with the Director as provided by rule may result in decertification.
(i) It is the respons ibility of the Certified Firm to notify the Director of any change in its circumstances
affecting its continued eligibility for the Program. Fai lure to do so may result in the firm's decertification.
U) The Director shall decertify a firm that does not continuously meet the eligibility criteria.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 14, 2006

Section 34-296. Annual Aspirational Goals.
The Annual Aspirational Goals for the utilization of MBEs and WBEs on County construction contracts
and subcontracts shall be 24% for MBEs and 4% for WBEs.

Section 34-297. Project Specific Goals.
The Director, in consultation with the User Department shall establish Project Specific Goals for
construction Contracts based upon the ava ilability of at least three MBEs and three WBEs to perform the
anticipated subcontracting functions of the project and the County's util ization of MBEs and WBEs to
date.

Section 34-298. Counting MBE and WBE Participation.
(a) The entire amount of that portion of a contract that is performed by the MBEs or WBEs own forces
shall be counted, including the cost of supp lies and materials obtained by the MBE or WBE for the work
of the contract, and supplies purchased or equipment leased by the MBE or WBE (except supplies and
equipment the MBE or WBE purchases or leases from the prime Contracto r or the prime Contractor' s
Affiliate).
(b) The entire amount of fees or commissions charged by a MBE or WBE for providing a bona fide
service, such as professional, technical, consultant or managerial services, or for providing bonds or
insurance specifically required for the performance of a contract, shall be counted, provided the fee is
reasonabl e and not excessive as compared with fees customarily charged for similar services.
( c) When a MBE or WBE performs as a participant in a Joint Venture, only the portion of the total dollar
value of the contract equal to the di stinct, c learl y defined portion of the work of the Joint Venture's
contract that is performed by the MBE or WBE with its own forces and for which it is separately at risk,
shall be counted.
(d) On ly expenditures to a MBE or WBE that is performing a Commercially Useful Function sha ll be
counted . To detennine whether a MBE or WBE is performing a Commercially Useful Function, the
County will evaluate the amount of work subcontracted, industry practices, whether the amount the MBE
or WBE is to be paid under the contract is commensurate with the work it is actually performing and
other relevant factors. To perform a Commercially Useful Function, the MBE or WBE must be
responsible, with respect to materia ls and supplies used on the contract, for negotiating price, determining
qua lity and quantity, ordering the material, in stalling (where applicable) and paying for the material itself.
A MBE or WBE does not perfonn a Commercially Useful Function if its role is limited to that of an extra
participant in the contract through which funds are passed in order to obtain the appearance of MBE or
WBE participation. If a MBE or WBE subcontracts a greater portion of the work of a contract than would
be expected based on normal industry practice, it is presumed not to perform a Commercially Useful
Function. When a MBE or WBE is presumed not to be perfonning a Commercially Useful Function, the
Certified Firm may present evidence to rebut this presumption.
(e) One hundred percent of the cost of the materials or supplies obtained from a MBE or WBE
Manufacturer or Regular Dealer sha ll be counted. One hundred percent of the fees or transportation
charges for the delivery of materials or supplies required on a job site shall be counted only if the
payment of such fees is a customary industry practice and are commensurate with fees customarily
charged for similar services.

142

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 14, 2006

(f) If a firm ceases to be a certified during its performance on a contract, the dollar value of work
performed under a contract with that finn after it has ceased to be certified shall not be counted.
(g) In determining achievement of Project Specific Goals, the participation of a MBE or WBE shall not be
counted until that amount has been paid to the MBE or WBE.

Section 34-299. Contract Pre- Award Compliance Procedures.
(a) For all solicitations, the bidder/proposer shall submit a Utilization Plan detailing all subcontractors
from which the Contractor solicited bids or quotations, and if Project Specific Goals have been
established, its achievement of the Goals or its Good Faith Efforts to do so. The Utilization Plan shall be
due at the time set out in the solicitation documents the bid proposal is due.
(b) Any agreement between a Contractor and a MBE or WBE in which the Contractor requires that the
MBE or WBE not provide subcontracting quotations to other Contractors is prohibited.
(c) Where the Contractor cannot achieve the Project Specific Goal(s), the Director will determine whether
the Contractor has made Good Faith Efforts to meet the Goal(s). In making this determination, the
Director will consider, at a minimum, the Contractor's efforts to:
( 1) Solicit through all reasonable and available means (e.g., attendance at pre-bid meetings,
advertising and written notices) the interest of all MBEs and WBEs certified in the scopes of work of the
contract. The Contractor shall provide interested MBEs and WBEs with timely, adequate infonnation
about the plans, specifications, and requirements of the contract to allow MBEs and WBEs to respond to
the solicitation . The Contractor must follow up initial solicitations with interested MBEs and WBEs.
(2) Select portions of the work to be performed by MBEs and WBEs in order to increase the
likelihood that the Project Specific Goals will be achieved. This includes, where appropriate, breaking
out contract work items into economically feasible units to facilitate MBE and WBE participation, even
when the Contractor would otherwise prefer to perform these work items with its own forces. It is the
Contractor's responsibility to make a portion of the work available to MBEs and WBEs and to select
those portions of the work or material needs consistent with the availability MB Es and WBEs to facilitate
their participation.
(3) Negotiate in good faith with interested MBEs and WBEs. Evidence of such negotiation
includes the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of MBEs and WBEs that were contacted; a
description of the information provided regarding the plans and specifications for the work selected for
subcontracting; and why agreements could not be reached with MBEs and WBEs. The Contractor may
not reject MBEs and WBEs as being unqualified without sound reasons based on a thorough investigation
of their capabilities. That there may be some additional costs involved in finding and using MBEs and
WBEs is not in itself sufficient reason for a Contractor's failure to meet the Project Specific Goa ls, as
long as such costs are reasonable. The ability or desire of a Contractor to perform the work of a contract
with its own organization does not relieve it of the responsibility to make Good Faith Efforts on all
subcontractable scopes of work.
(4) Make efforts to assist interested MBEs and WBEs in obtaining bonding, lines of credit, or
insurance as required by the County or the prime Contractor, where appropriate.
(5) Make efforts to assist interested MBEs and WBEs in obtaining necessary equipment, supplies,
materials, or related assistance or services, where appropriate.
(6) Use the services of the Office of Contract Compliance, available minority/women community
organizations, minority/women contractors' groups, government sponsored minority/women business
assistance offices and other appropriate organizations to provide assistance in the recruitment and
placement of MBEs and WBEs.

143

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 14, 2006

(e) In determining whether a Contractor has made Good Faith Efforts, the perfonnance of other
Contractors in meeting the Project Spec ific Goals may be considered. For example, when the apparent
successful Contractor fails to meet the Project Specific Goals but others meet it, it may be reasonably
questioned whether, with additional reasonable efforts, the apparent successful Contractor could have met
the Project Specific Goals. Similarly, if the apparent successful Contractor fails to meet the Project
Specific Goals, but meets or exceeds the average MBE or WBE participation obtained by other
Contractors, this may be evidence that the apparent successful Contractor made Good Faith Efforts.

(f) A signed letter of intent from each listed MBE or WBE, describing the work, materials, equipment or
services to be performed or provided by the MBE or WBE and the agreed upon dollar value shall be due
as specified in the solieitation dool:lments at the time of bid proposal or within three days after such
submission.
(g) The Director shall timely review the Utilization Plan before award, including the scope of work and
the letters of intent from MBEs and WBEs. The Director may request clarification in writing of items
listed in the Utilization Plan, provided such clarification shall not include the opportunity to augment
listed participation or Good Faith Efforts.
(h) If the Director determines that the Utilization Plan demonstrates that the Project Specific Goals have
been achieved or Good Faith Efforts made, with the concurrence of the User Department, the Director and
User Department shall recommend award to Purchasing Agent.
(i) If the Director finds that a Contractor did not make sufficient Good Faith Efforts, the Director shall
communicate this finding to the User Department and recommend that the bid/proposal be rejected. A
Contractor may protest this determination pursuant to the County's bid protest procedures.

Section 34-300. Contract Administration Procedures.
(a) Upon award of a contract by the County that includes Project Specific Goals, the Project Specific
Goals become covenants of performance by the Contractors in favor of the County.
(b) The Contractor shall provide a listing of all subcontractors to be used in the performance of the
contract, and detailed subcontractor information to the County with each request for payment submitted to
the County or as otherwise directed by the County. The Director and the User Department shall monitor
subcontractor participation during the course of the contract. The County shall have full and timely
access to the Contractor's books and records, including without limitation payroll records, tax returns and
records and books of account, to determine the Contractor's compliance with its commitment to MBE and
WBE participation and the status of any MB E or WBE performing any portion of the contract. This
provision shall b e in addition to, and not a substitute for, any other provision allowing inspection of the
Contractor's records by any officer or official of the County for any purpose.
(c) The Contractor cannot make changes to the Utilization Plan or substitute MBEs or WBEs named in
the Utilization Plan without the prior written approval of the Director, Purchasing Agent and the User
Department. Unauthorized changes or substitutions shall be a violation of this Ordinance and a breach of
contract, and may constitute grounds for rejection of the bid or proposal or cause tennination of the
executed contract for breach, the withholding of payment and/or subject the Contractor to contract
penalties or other sanctions.

144

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 14, 2006

(I) All requests for changes or substitutions of a MBE or WBE Subcontractor(s) named in the
Utilization Plan shall be made to the Director, Purchasing Agent and the User Department in writing, and
shall clearly and fully set forth the basis for the request. A Contractor shall not substitute a MBE or WBE
subcontractor or perform the work designated for a MBE or WBE subcontractor with its own forces
unless and until the Director, Purchasing Agent and the User Department approve such substitution in
writing. A Contractor shall not allow a substituted subcontractor to begin work until both the Director,
Purchasing Agent and the User Department have approved the substitution.
(2) The facts supporting the request must not have been known nor reasonably should have been
known by either party before the submission of the Utilization Plan. Bid shopping is prohibited. The
Contractor must negotiate with the MBE or WBE subcontractor to resolve the problem. Where there has

(4) The County's final decision whether to permit or deny the proposed substitution, and the basis
of any denial, shall be commun icated to the parties in writing by the Director.
(5) Where the Contractor has established the basis for the substitution to the satisfaction of the
County, the Contractor shall make Good Faith Efforts to fulfill the Utilization Plan. The Contractor may
seek the assistance of the Office of Contract Compliance in obtaining a new MBE or WBE. If the Project
Specific Goal(s) cannot be reached and Good Faith Efforts have been made, the Contractor may substitute
with a non-Certified Firm.
(6) If the County requires the substitution of a MBE or WBE subcontractor listed in the Utilization
Plan, the Contractor shall undertake Good Faith Efforts to fulfill the Utilization Plan. The Contractor
may seek the assistance of the Office of Contract Compliance in obtaining a new MBE or WBE
subcontractor. If the Goal(s) cannot be reached and Good Faith Efforts have been made, the Contractor
may substitute with a non-Certified F inn.
(d) If a Contractor plans to hire a subcontractor on any scope of work that was not previously disclosed in
the Utilization Plan, the Contractor shall obtain the approval of the Director to modify the Utilization Plan
and must make Good Faith Efforts to ensure that MBES and WBEs have a fair opportunity to bid on the
new scope of work.
(e) Changes to the scopes of work shall be documented by the User Department at the time they arise, to
establish the reasons for the change and the effect on achievement of the MBE or WBE goal.
(f) Prior to contract closeout, the Director shall evaluate the Contractor's fulfillment of the contracted
goals, taking into account all approved substitutions, tenninations and changes to the contract's scope of
work. If the County detennines that Good Faith Efforts to meet the MBE or WBE commitments were not
made, or that fraudulent misrepresentations have been made, or any other breach of the contract or
violation of this Ordinance, a remedy or sanction may be imposed, as provided in the contract.

narrowly tailored remedies.
(d) On or before the sunset date of this Chapter, the County shall review the results of this evidence
gathering, to detennine whether it has a compelling interest in continuing narrowly tailored remedies to

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 14, 2006

Commissioner Maldonado inquired as to the effective date of the Ordinance.
Ms. Holt replied that the effective date will be ninety days after passage, to allow enough time for
notification.
Ms. Ho lt asked for the commissioners' support in the budget process of an avai lability study.
Commissioner Gorman inquired about the possibility of conducting a disparity study on goods and
services.
Ms. Holt replied that there has been very little litigation in this area, and hence it is not necessary.
President Steele inquired as to the cost of a disparity study regarding construction.
Ms. Ho lt replied that the cost would be approximately $500,000 for the County to conduct the study
alone. Several years ago there were discussions of conducting a nine-agency inter-jurisdiction disparity
study for construction at the cost of $250,000 per agency; this project never happened.
President Steele inquired whether any private or charitable agency has ever funded a disparity study.
Ms. Holt replied in the negative.
Commissioner Gorman inquired whether there would be a cost-savings by conducting a construction

28 1408

A RESOLUTION REAFFIRMING ITS OFFICIAL SUPPORT EARLIER THIS YEAR
OF PRIVATE BILL HR 3856, THE FAMILY UNITY ACT (PROPOSED
RESOLUTION). Submitting a Proposed Resolution sponsored by Roberto Maldonado,
County Commissioner.
I am submitting the attached Resolution as a New Item at the September 7, 2006 Board
meeting to be referred to the committee on Law Enforcement and Correction s for a
public hearing. The Resolution declares Cook County "A Sanctuary County", a county
that defends that basic human rights and dignity of undocumented immigrants and
stands in solidarity with loca l governments across the nation who have declared
themselves "Sanctuaries."
Furthermore, the Resolution prohibits Cook County
Departments and the Sheriff's Office from inquiring about immigration status and
unilaterally enforcing immigration law provisions, to the extent allowed by law.
The following is a synopsis of the Proposed Resolution:

148

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 14, 2006

PROPOSED RESOLUTION

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the County of Cook be declared " A
Sanctuary County," a county that defends the basic human rights and dignity of
undocumented immigrants and our democratic principles of life, liberty, and justice,
and all those who, as Emma Lazarus wrote in her famous sonnet that now is engraved
on a plaque at the Statue of Liberty, are " tired ... poor ... [and] ... yearn to breathe free ... "
and recognizes that much of the historical and moral tradition of our nation is rooted in
the provision of sanctuary to those seeking a safe haven from oppression; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the County of Cook supports the humanitarian
efforts of Reverend Walter Coleman, who, in good faith, has opened the doors of the
Adalberto United Methodist Church in Cook County to provide sanctuary to Elvira
Arellano and her U.S. citizen son and who are prepared to accept the penalty for this act
of civil disobedience in the hope that this violation of current immigration law will lead
to comprehensive immigration reform that respects the rights of immigrants as families,
workers, and human beings; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the County of Cook stands in solidarity with
local governments across the nation who have declared themselves " Sanctuaries"
upholding the basic human rights of immigrants, including the cities of San Francisco,
Maywood, Huntington Park and Coachella in California and the City of Cambridge in
Massachusetts; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the County of Cook joins several major cities,
including Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Minneapolis, Saint Paul, and
others who have official policies prohibiting their municipal agencies from inquiring
about immigration status and unilaterally enforcing immigration law provisions, and
hereby requires that no Cook County employee or department, to the extent legally
possible, will request information about or otherwise assist in the investigation of the
citizenship status of any County resident, will disseminate information regarding the
citizenship of a County resident, or condition the provision of County of Cook services
or benefits on matters related to citizenship; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that requiring, or promoting, local enforcement of
immigration laws gives rise to an increased threat of immigrant and minority profiling
and harassment and, therefore, it is the policy of the Cook County Sheriff's Office not
to become involved in the enforcement of federal civil immigration laws to the extent
legally possible; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and
the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement be called upon to issue a moratorium
on raids until the U.S. Congress comes to an agreement on comprehensive immigration
reform so that the debate can be carried out in good faith, rather than against a backdrop
of fear, repression and intimidation ; and

149

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 14, 2006

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the County of Cook rejects the use of the word
" illegal" to describe human beings and the use of the word "aliens" to describe
immigrants, which has a dehumanizing effect and helps justify policies that seek to
criminalize and exclude immigrants, and hereby adopts the language " undocumented"
when referring to those who do not have federally recognized resident status and
" immigrant" to refer to those who have migrated to the U.S. from another country; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners
reaffirms its official support earlier this year of private bill HR 3856, the Family Unity
Act, which protects 35 Illinois families from being torn apart by our broken
immigration laws, and reaffirms its official support in 2005 of "The Secure America
Act" which allows families to be reunited more quickly through the family immigration
system; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a copy of this resolution be submitted to the
Illinois Congressional delegation and to President George Bush on behalf of the entire
Cook County Board.

*Referred to the Committee on Law Enforcement and Corrections on 09-07-06.

AMENDED RESOLUTION
Sponsored by
THE HONORABLE ROBERTO MALDONADO, COUNTY COMMISSIONER
WHEREAS, the County of Cook is a home rule unit of local government pursuant to
Article VII, Section 6(a) of the 1970 Illinois Constitution; and

WHEREAS, pursuant to its home rule power, the County of Cook may exercise any
power and perform any function relating to its government and affairs including the
power to regulate for the protection of the public health, safety, morals, and welfare; and

WHEREAS, to this end, the County of Cook is dedicated to providing all of its residents
with equal access to the services, opportunities, and protection county government has
been established to administer; and

WHEREAS, there are now approximately 12 million undocumented immigrants in the
United States, including half a million in Illinois and more than 300,000 in Cook
County, who have been systematically denied the opportunity enjoyed by past
generations of immigrants to become legal permanent residents or citizens of this
country; and

WHEREAS, conditioning the provision of services, opportunities, and protection on
citizenship or immigrant status or inquiring about such status in the course of such
provision directly contravenes the County 's commitment to ensuring equal access for all
of its residents; and
WHEREAS, 13rior to 1918, the term " illegal immigrant" l~ad no meaniAg siAee the
United States did not eveA require 13assports aAd the Mexican U.S. border \\'as
u0guarded a0d passed freely; and
WHEREAS, when Congress passed the National Origi0s Aet in 1924, it began its
restrictive iFBmigratioA poliey, plaeing striet q1:1otas on the n1:1mbers of Italians, Irish,
Germa0s, Je .vs, Japanese, and other ethnicities, who were co0sidered i0ferior by many
white Protestant AFBericans; and
1

WHEREAS, in 1965, Congress re13ealed the ~~atio0al Origi0s Act a0d established a ne·.v
system of immigratioA restrieting the n1:1mber of new arrivals, b1:1t making it illegal to
discriminate against applicants beca1:1se of their birthplace, raee or eth0ieity; and

151

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 14, 2006

\\'llEREAS, over the past h't'o decades, immigratioR polio~· has become e'ven more
restrictive and puniti'<'e and closed off aven11es previol:lsly available for immigrants to
obtain legal permanent residency, while the U.8. Mexico border has been forther
militarized; aRd
WHEREAS, current U.S. immigration policy does not reflect our democratic values of
what is just, humane and moral and as the current debate on comprehensive immigration
refonn comes to a halt, the urgency to find real, workable solutions to modernize our
archaic immigration laws becomes desperately apparent; and
\\'HEREAS, the migration experience has adverse emotional and psychological effects
on families, especially those who have U.8. citizen families, incll:lding children and/or
spol:lses, and are forced to separate for ffiany years d11e to 11nj11st iffiffiigration policies
aRd backlogs in visa applications; and
WHEREAS, raids carried ol:lt by the federal government, ranging from the highly
pl:lblicized nation\vide \Yorkplace raids OR April 17, 2006 that resl:llted in the arrest of
1, 187 employees to the less widely known sweeps of homes, have instilled fear and
panic in immigrant comml:lnities, enco11raged intimidatioR, harassment and racial
profiling, a0d led to the separation of many from their U.8. citizen families and
\\'HEREAS, one of these families recently gai0ed natio0al attention, when an
l:!Rdoemnented mother, Elvira Arellano, defied a deportatio0 order froffi the U.8.
lffimigration and C11stoms Enforceme0t and sought sanctl:lary in the Adalberto United
Methodist Ch11reh in Chicago with her U.8. eitize0 son; and
WHEREAS, altho11gh the plight of Elvira and her son is the plight of ffiillio0s
l:lndocmnented iffimigrants with U.8. eitizon families, her fate is a test ease that will
either set our natioR on the progressive path of real, hl:lffiane, iffimigration reform or the
regressive path of fear, repression and intiinidation; and
WHEREAS, according to a recent study on undocumented immigrants conducted by the
University of Illinois at Chicago' s Center for Urban Economic Development,
undocumented workers contribute much more to the U.S. economy than they receive:
the majority work full-time ; 70% pay taxes; the majority don' t collect tax refunds they
have earned; 220,000 currently employed in Chicago contribute $5.35 billion annually to
the area economy as a result of their local consumer spending; they make far less use of
available social services than any other group; and
WHEREAS, Douglas S. Massey, a Princeton University professor and author of
"Beyond Smoke and Mirrors: Mexican Immigration in an Era of Economic Integration,"
further supports these statistics, stating that in 2004 alone, undocumented workers
contributed $7 billion to Social Security and $1.5 billion to Medicare with the
knowledge that they would have no claim to future collection; and
HERE,"•.S, despite these statistics, there is a grov>'ing sentime0t of hatred a0d
intimidation of l:!Rdoemnontod immigrants feelings reminiscent of nearly every
historical wave of migration iRto the U .8. 40% of the first massive wave of immigra0ts
that caffie to America between l 815 and l 860 were escaping starvation in Ireland, b11t
'Nere derided as stl:lpid, lazy a0d dirty, despite the fact they cleaned hol:lses and cared for
the children of the rich and toiled in dangerol:ls Fnines a0d filthy sweatshops; and

Superintendent's General Order stating that "the enforcement of immigration law rests

Sheriff's Office to prohibit the investigation or assistance in the investigation of the
citizenship or residency status of any person unless such inquiry or investigation is

WHEREAS, sex offenders cross socio-economic boundaries, living in both the richest and

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 14, 2006

thereby giving them, in a timely manner, the information they need to protect their fami lies
and reduce the chance of future victimization.
*Referred to the Committee on Law Enforcement and Corrections on March 1, 2006.
Approved as amended on September 14, 2006. Withdrawn from the agenda on
September 19, 2006.
Chairman Maldonado stated that Communication No. 276232, which was approved as amended at the
September 14, 2006 Law Enforcement and Corrections meeting, the committee report was withdrawn at
the September 19, 2006 Board Mee ting in order that this public hearing could be held.
Commissioner Moreno stated that some of the public speakers will be sharing valuable experience which
they possess in implementing victim alert systems.
Zelda Whittler, Undersheriff, Office of the Sheriff, delivered the following remarks: While the concept
behind this Ordinance is admirable, she is uncertain whethe r the Sheriff's Office has the necessary funds
to commit to implement this Ordinance, given the budget cuts which the Sheriff' s Office will sustain this
year. Another concern is that the information that will be utilized in the implementation of this Ordinance
will be obtained from the Illinoi s State Police, and may be inaccurate. Additionally, this Ordinance may
create liability for the County. She wou ld like to examine this Ordinance more closely to determine how
the Sheriff's Office could have greater control. He r office has met with Commissioner Moreno's office
as well as with the State's Attorney ' s Office and w ith Catherine Maras-O ' Leary. C urre ntly, the Sheriffs
Office accesses data from the Illinoi s State Police and provides a website where a citizen can determine
which registered sex offenders live in their area. The State's Attorney 's Office also has a victim alert
program . She would like to involve more people to determine the greater impact of this Ordinance.
Chairman Maldonado inquired what the cost of this program would be.
Ms. Whittler replied that she cannot provide that information at this time. However, the State's
Attorney ' s victim notification program notifies 17,000 victims and costs $250,000. The majority of these
victims prefer to be notified by phone; also, not everyone has access to e-mail.
Commissioner Butler voiced his concern that people who committed lesser offenses or unwisely plea
bargained would be unfairly stigmatized by this Ordinance. He read part of a letter submitted by Jo Anne
Smith, LCSW , and requested that it be entered into the record. (The referenced documents are on fi le in
the Office of the County Clerk.)

157

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER I 4, 2006

Commissioner Moreno stated that Software does exist that would enable the County to alert victi ms. Two
of the main issues are timeliness and accuracy. The implementation of this Ordinance would require a
collective effort of all the police departments in Cook County supervised by the Sheriff's Office in
conjunction with the State's Attorney's Office. Of particular importance would be the input of those
organizations that already have a victim alert system in place.
Chairman Maldonado asked the Secretary to the Board to call on the following registered public speakers:
I) Cara Smith - Po licy Directo r, Illino is Attorney General 's Office
2) Shauna Bo liker - Chief, Sex Crimes Division, Cook County State 's Attorney 's Office
3) Trevor Peterson - Director of Government Relations, Chicago Children's Advocacy Center
4) George Blakemore - Concerned C itizen

Commissioner Moreno moved to adjourn the meeting, seconded by Commissioner Butler. The motion
carried and the meeting was adjourned.
