PROPOSED RESOLUTION

WHEREAS, the Cook County Co mmission on Women 's Iss ues s ubmitted a re port titled '·Girl Violence
and Agg ression: Problem s and Solutions" to the Cook County Board of Commissioners in Aug ust 2006;
and

3

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 4, 2006

WHEREAS, the Commission made various recommendations to improve the conditions for girls and
young women at the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center (JTDC).
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners adopt the following
recommendations:
l ) The Cook County Juvenile Temporary Detention Center should institutionalize gender-responsive
programming and policies which take into account the distinct needs of girls, including their
physical and emotional safety.
A) The JTDC should expand the very limited resources currently allocated to the
development and implementation of gender-responsive policies and programs.
B) The JTDC should support the formation of an advisory committee on the implementation
of gender-responsive programs and policies.
C) The JTDC should require mandatory on-going training on gender responsiveness in the
criminal justice system, similar to training developed by the Sheriffs Department of
Women's Justice Services.
2) The County should study long-term solutions for girls involved in the j uvenile justice system,
including separate facilities and comprehensive services much like those which are offered to
women through the Cook County Sheriffs Department of Women's Justice Services. The
Sheriffs Department of Women's Justice Services uses a gender-responsive integrated model
which can serve as an example for the best practices in establishing a gender-responsive system
for juvenile girls.
3) The County should expand Project RENEW to serve all girls on probation throughout all of the
County's police districts. As of May 2006, 232 of the 728 girl s on probation are in the project,
which prepares girls to return to their communities by helping them recognize the resources
available to them and providing ties to their communities.
4) The County should provide support for the development and maintenance of a GIRLS LINK
website. This website would serve as a centralized source of links to several resources and tools
geared towards serving girls involved in or at-risk of being involved in the juvenile j ustice
system.
5) The County should support programs that successfully connect girls in the juvenile j ustice system
with community-based resources, including health and mental health services. In 1998, a model
gender-responsive, community-based case management program was developed by GIRLS LINK
and was piloted through Metropolitan Family Service. The program has been funded by the Cook
County Board of Commissioners since 1998 and has a current annual budget of $135,000. The
case management program services girls ages I0 to 16 who are petitioned through the court from
two of Chicago's police districts. The case management program and model needs a
comprehensive outcome evaluation to detennine its efficiency, to assess its strengths and to
identify areas that need improvement, such as increasing its referral base. The data should help
detenn ine whether the program needs modification, should be replicated and/or whether
alternative programs should be developed.

Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Butler, moved that the Proposed Resolution be
referred to the Committee on Finance. (Comm. No. 282088). The motion carried unanimously.

Submitting a Proposed Resolution sponsored by
ROBERTO MALDONADO, County Commissioner
PROPOSED RESOLUTION

WHEREAS, the John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County Security Police Force (" Police Force")
was established in the nineteen-seventies through Illinois State Statute enabling legislation 55 ILCS 5/5370 11 which authorized the Cook County Board of Commissioners to appoint security police officers to
act as "conservators of the peace"; and
WHEREAS, the purpose of establishing this Police Force was to protect the public peace by vesting
Police Force Officers w ith powers "to carry weapons within or upon hospita l facil ities or prem ises"; and
WHEREAS, furthennore, the state Jaw seeks to prevent the hiring of a Police Force Officer who may be
predisposed to abuse of power by allowing the Board to "establish reasonable e lig ibility requirements fo r
appointment. .. relating to residence, health, habits and moral character" and by excluding anyone who is a
"habitua l drunkard, gambler or a person convicted of a fe lony or a crime involving moral turpitude"; and
WHEREAS, numerous allegations from patients, visitors, and employees against the Police Force
recently accuse certain Police Force Officers of police brutality, allegedly committing acts of physical and
emotional abuse of power and even false arrests, and it has also been revealed that other officers have
criminal arrests in their past, all clear violations of the plain language and spirit of the enabling
legislation; and
WHEREAS, the most recent allegation occurred on September 11 of 2006, when a Police Force Officer
allegedly used excessive force on an elderly man after asking about his ethnicity and immigration status,
and subsequently charged the elderly man with battery and resisting arrest. FBI agents are now
conducting an investigation into whether there was a potential violation of federal civil ri ghts Jaws or a
'·color of law violation'' meaning a sworn law enfo rcement officer overstepped his authorized powers; and
WHEREAS, although the Pol ice Force has the " power to make arrests or cause to be arrested, with or
without process, any person who breaks the peace, or may be found violating any State statutes or city or
county ordinances within or upon such faci lities or premises;' an alleged victim of Police Force abuse
must file a fonnal complaint internally either through the John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County
Patient Relations Department or through the Cook County Inspector General's Office which, according to
the alleged victims, have failed to initiate any investigation ; and
WHEREAS, the Police Force is budgeted in 2006 for a total of 77 employees (7 1 sworn and 6 civilian) at
a cost of nearly $3 million; and

5

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 4, 2006

WHEREAS, the Police Force's function established over thirty years ago has not fulfilled its stated
purpose as "conservators of peace" and has instead, led to an atmosphere of hostility, distrust, and
brutality that is a clear detriment to the mission of John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County, that of
saving the lives and souls of people who suffer from physical and emotional injury.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that a hearing will be held in the Law Enforcement and
Corrections Committee and the Stroger and Cennak Hospitals Subcommittee to discuss the most efficient
and cost effective method of replacing the Hospital Police Force with an alternative security unit; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that funding for the John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County
Security Police Force shall be phased out in Fiscal Year 2007, during which time the Bureau of Health
Services will give the necessary notice to the union representing the Police Force and initiate the
competitive bidding process for the replacement of the Police Force with Security Officers within one
year of the enactment of this Resolution.

Commissioner Maldonado, seconded by Commissioner Moreno, moved to suspend the rules so that this
matter may be considered. The motion carried unanimously.
Commissioner Maldonado, seconded by Commissioner Moreno, moved that the Proposed Resolution be
referred to the Committee on Finance. (Comm. No. 282089). The motion carried.
Commissioner Butler voted "no".

281765.
Chairman Silvestri added Commissioners added all members as co-sponsors.
Commissioner Hansen inquired as to the purpose of establishing a Cook County Zoning and Building
Local Government Advisory Committee.
Chainnan Silvestri replied that such a committee would improve communications between the Cook
County Code Enforcement, the Zoning Board of Appeals, and local governments throughout the County.
Commissioner Hansen stated that the Cook County Board of Commissioners should avoid creating excess
bureaucracy.
Chainnan Silvestri stated that this is not to create another bureaucracy and that this Advisory Committee
would have no administrati ve role, only advisory, and would meet on a regular basis to communicate with
the Department of Building and Zoning.
Chainnan Si lvestri stated: This is an Advisory Committee to the Board and this committee would not
e liminate the Board 's authority. Six zones would be picked in suburban Cook County and one person
from each zone would be appointed by the Pres ident of the Board. These persons would gather to discuss
problem areas in their neighborhoods.
Alex Seith, Zoning Board of Appeals explained that the Zoning Board of Appeals recommends on three
types of cases: variations, special uses and amendments. The Ordinance provides that the County Board
can pose conditions and restrictions on any cases the Zoning Board of Appeals recommends, which is
very important. The Zoning Board of Appeals does not enforce the restrictions; these restrictions are
enforced by the Building and Zoning Department.

Commissioner Daley voiced concerns about the source of funding.
Chaimrnn Silvestri stated that the Resolution is distinctive and it is a Zoning and Building issue. He
further stated that he foresees a small staff and that other governments have noted that it pays for itself
over time.
Commissioner Daley asked about staffing and whether there would be a need to hire additional personnel.
James L. Eldridge, Jr., Chief Administrative Officer, noted there are available personnel, but it would be
difficult to perfonn the duties of the Zoning and Building Department without hiring additional personnel.
Commissioner Daley continued asking about the funding ifthe General Assembly adopted the resolution.
Chainnan Silvestri noted that when the State legislation created Administrative Adjudications they
allowed it for every government in Illinois except Cook County government. He stated that this is a good

escrow in the capital budget to be used when and if the renovation of the old Cook County Hospital takes
place. This amendment is presently being distributed.
Commissioner Murphy stated that she has had several discussions with John W. Davis, Director, Real
Estate Management Division. She asked that the following public listings be entered into the record:
1300 South Wabash, listed at $5,550,000.00, and 2248 South Michigan, listed at $4,500,000.00, both on

contracted to have an appraisal perfonned.
Mr. Davis replied in the affinnative.
Commissioner Suffredin inquired whether the offering price is greater than the appraisal price.
Mr. Davis replied in the affinnative.

appraisers. He further stated that the offering price exceeds both appraisals.
Commissioner Suffredin inquired whether the appraisals took into consideration comparable sales of
properties within the area and highest use value.
Mr. Davis replied in the affinnative.
Commissioner Collins inquired as to how the County obtains the appraisers it uses.
Mr. Davis replied that the President's Office approves a list of appraisers.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDJNGS FOR OCTOBER 4, 2006

Commissioner Collins asked how a certified apprai ser would get on the County's list of appraisers.
Mr. Davis replied that appraisers can submit their name to Mr. Davis or to President Steele's Office.
Commissioner Peraica inquired as to the two companies that perfonned the appraisals on this property.
Mr. Davis replied that their names are Midwest Appraisal Company at 3000 West 111 th Street and
Applied Real Estate Analysis at 914 South Wabash.
Commissioner Peraica inquired as to who at these two firms signed off on the appraisals.
Mr. Davis replied that Kathleen Dart of Midwest Appraisal Company, and Andy Prodanovic of Applied
Real Estate Analysis signed off on the appraisals.
Commissioner Peraica inquired as to the appraisal made by Midwest Appraisal Company.
Mr. Davis replied that it was substantially less than $4,250,000.00.
Commissioner Peraica inquired whether the appraisal was less than the offering price.
Mr. Davis replied in the affirmative.
Commissioner Peraica inquired as to how the property was listed.
Mr. Davis replied that no broker was utilized, at a $250,000 savings to Cook County; it was listed on the
County Web Site and with the Sun Times.
Commissioner Peraica inquired how many offers were made.
Mr. Davis replied that sixteen individuals picked up packages, and one responded.
Commissioner Peraica inquired whether there was a two-bid requirement.
Mr. Davis replied in the negative.
Anna Ashcraft, Special Assistant to the President, noted that the offer came from the owner of a
neighboring property.
Commissioner Quigley inquired whether Mr. Davis knew why there was no other bid.
Mr. Davis replied that he did not have a reason for this. He specified that the Department of Facilities
Management personnel gave tours to numerous developers.
Commissioner Quigley inquired whether $4,000,000.00 was perhaps too high a price for most of the
prospective bidders.
Mr. Davis replied in the affirmative.
Chainnan Daley stated for the record that this item was put on the Agenda at the request of the
Administration. He further stated that it was his understanding that Mr. Davis had spoken to many of the
commissioners, and had attempted to speak to them all.

69

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 4, 2006

Commissioner Butler inquired whether he expects the new owner to demolish the building on the
property and how much it would cost.
Mr. Davis replied in the affirmative and stated that the demolition would cost approximately $ 150,000.00.
Commissioner Claypool suggested that brokers have numerous relationships with potential bidders and
use of a broker could have thus yielded more bids; he inquired why a broker was not used on this
property.
Mr. Davis stated that it was a judgment call on his part and that the County saved $250,000.00 by not
utilizing a broker.
Commissioner Murphy stated that she was satisfied with going forward on this item, after having several
conversations with Mr. Davis, with staff, and also going on the internet and speaking with some brokers
in the area.
Commissioner Daley asked the Secretary to the Board to call on the following registered public speaker:

Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Committee on Finance of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County met pursuant to notice for a
public hearing on Thursday, September 28, 2006, at the hour of 10:00 A.M. in the Board Room, Room
569, County Building, 118 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois.
Chainnan Daley asked Comm issioner Quigley to provide an overview of the items to be considered by
the Committee.
Commissioner Quigley delivered the following comments:
The proposed ordinances would neither impair tax increment financing nor create a moratorium at the
state level on TJFs. The proposed resolution requests that state government conduct an empirical analysis
of the effectiveness of TIF programs. The number of TIF districts has ri sen from seven in 1984 to 363 at
present, including 136 in Chicago. TIF districts cover one-third of the land area in Chicago. Chicago TIF
districts raise $386 million per year; this is more than the amount of taxes levied by Cook County in the
City of Chicago yearly. If these funds were returned to the tax roll s, citize ns' taxes would decrease by
10% in Chicago and 5% in the suburbs. Just as Chicago's Special Service Areas are reflected on tax bills,
so should TIFs. The Southern Illinois county of Williamson reflects TIFs on its tax bills. In order to
detennine the appropriateness of a TIF for a given area, one should consider whether the equalized
assessed value would grow without a TIF. According to academic research, T!Fs have very little positi ve
impact upon equalized assessed value growth. Simply asserting that equalized assessed value increases in
a TIF area does not establish a causal relationship; this value might have increased without the T IF. EA V
totals in the annual TIF reports suggest there is growth that cannot be attributed to TIF activity. Of the 45
TIFs that had not yet received any public investment and had no debt service, only eight had negati ve
equalized assessed value growth. The remaining 37 T!Fs are growing in value without any public finance
activi ty or subsidized private activity. The LaSalle Street TIF will be in effect for 23 years, with 12
additional optional years. As a result of the proposed ordinances and proposed resolution, the County
Board would have input into the decision to create a new TIF, the TIF would be reflected on tax bills, and
the State would be requested to perfonn statistical analysis on the effectiveness of TIFs. TIFs shrink the
available tax revenue for other agencies. Countywide governments are negatively impacted by TIFs.
T IFs increase everyone's tax rate.

ILLfNOIS TAX fNCREMENT FfNANCE REVIEW AND REFORM RESOLUTION
(PROPOSED RESOLUTION). Submitting a Proposed Resolution sponsored by Mike
Quigley, County Commissioner.
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
ILLINOIS TAX INCREMENT FINANCE REVIEW
AND REFORM RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, the State of Illinois first authorized the creation of tax increment finance
(TIF) districts in I 977, to encourage development in blighted areas by using the prospect
of future growth to issue bonds in order to jumpstart infrastructure and site
improvements; and
WHEREAS, fo r the initial 23-year lifetime of a TIF district, Cook County and other
taxing bodies receive tax revenue only from the assessed value present in the district at its
creation, known as the baseline equalized assessed value, an amount which is not
adjusted for inflation; and

72

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 4, 2006

WHEREAS, the establishment of a TIF district in a municipality in Cook County
requires the approval of a joint review board, on which the County holds only one seat,
meaning that the County alone cannot stop the creation of a TIF district to which it is
opposed; and
WHEREAS, certain other units of government which collect property taxes from the
area contained within a proposed TIF district, such as the Forest Preserve District of
Cook County, are not members of the joint review board and are therefore excluded from
the decision-making process; and
WHEREAS, once a TIF district is established, the municipality in which the TIF district
is located has total control over the funds generated by the TIF district, even though said
funds are generated by diverting tax revenues that otherwise would have gone to all units
of government present in the TIF district; and
WHEREAS, critics have objected to the creation of certain TIF districts in areas that
would not be considered blighted or at risk of becoming blighted by most definitions; and
WHEREAS, the effectiveness of TIF districts in Jllinois has never been studied
com prehensively.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of
Commissioners urges the Illinois General Assembly to authorize a study evaluating the
effectiveness of TIF districts in the state; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners urges
the Illinois General Assembly to amend the state's TIF legis lation to refocus the program
on its original purpose of helping truly blighted areas and to establish a role for all
affected taxing bodies in the governance and oversight of TJF districts and the
distribution of TIF funds.
*Referred to the Committee on Finance on 06/20/06.
Commissioner Quigley, seconded by Commissioner Silvestri, moved to receive and file
Communication No. 279603. The motion carried.
Chainnan Daley proceeded with the remaining items on the agenda, Communication Numbers 279604
and 28 1405.
Commissioner Murphy stated that she was reluctant to take power away from local mayors on this issue.
Commissioner Quigley clarified that existing legislation requires that all TIFs be approved by a joint
review board; the County currently has a representative on this board. The commissioners themselves
should know when a new TIF is being considered, and should be ab le to advise the representative
accordingly. The process ofTIF approval would not be slowed.
Commissioner Murphy stated that she is infonned on a regular basis of TIFs.
Commissioner Collins inquired whether the Board fonnally appoints someone to the TIF joint review
board.

73

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 4, 2006

Jacqueline K. Harder, Director of Economic Development, Cook County Department of Planning and
Development, replied that the President delegated to the Department of Planning and Development the
responsibility to assign a representative to the joint review board. The state statute requires that a
representative from all taxing bodies contained in the TIF district must attend the meetings. Also a citizen
representative is nominated by the community and voted on by the joint review board.
Ms. Harder stated that the County is currently represented by a staff member in the Economic
Development Office of the Department of Planning and Development, and this individual has an
extensive background in economic development, including experience with the state and the City of
Chicago.
Commissioner Claypool stated that the County currently works effectively with local municipalities on
economic development through 6Bs tax suspension and diminution, where it maintains the authority to
reject applications for tax relief.
Commissioner Sims noted how vital TIFs are to her district and how vocal her constituents have been
against the proposed resolution and proposed ordinances. She stated that while she supports the
transparency measure, she feels the proposed ordinances would be detrimental to her district.
Commissioner Silvestri stated that the state has made the TIF approval process sufficiently open with its
provision for the joint review board. His district has five suburban TIFs with joint review boards which
meet regularly; he has attended some of these meetings. Constituents can directl y contact their mayor or
aldennan with input into the TIF process. These proposed ordinances and proposed resolution will not
generate additional funds for schools, nor will they prevent the abuse of TIFs by local governments. This
is a matter for the state and municipalities.
Commissioner Suffredin stated that while the state affords the County a seat on the joint review board, the
County does not have veto power. The constitutional and statutory purpose of tax bills is to tell people
how much they owe in taxes, not how much they don ' t owe. Additional information concerning TIFs on
the tax bill might be confusing. The Board needs to detennine the role of County representatives in
attending joint review board meetings. Also the County was previously granted authority to create TIFs
by the lllinois General Assembly. He requested that Commissioner Quigley withdraw the proposed
ordinances and resolution so that they can be reworked to address the issues of transparency,
representation, and the possibility of the County creating TIFs.
Commissioner Murphy stated that in her district there are public hearings and other openness measures
undertaken when TIFs are being considered. Letters that she has received against these ordinances and
resolution include those from the Southwest Conference of Mayors (21 members), West Central
Municipal Conference (36 municipalities and I township) and the Metropolitan Mayors' Caucus (272
mayors).
Commissioner Collins stated that it would be more effective to involve local government rather than the
state in any analysis or oversight. She suggested that more work be done on specific problem s regarding
TIFs.
Commissioner Maldonado stated that he is for transparency and for listing the allocation of TIF funds on
tax bills.
Chainnan Daley requested that Catherine Maras O'Leary, Chief Information Officer, estim ate a cost of
listing the allocation ofTIF funds on property tax bills.

74

 JO URNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 4, 2006

Mrs. O' Leary stated she would need input from the County Clerk to assist her w ith modifications to the
system; additionally, this would entail internal personnel costs.
Chainnan Daley stated that the County Clerk estimated that sending out postcards would cost $50,000.
He further stated that there are jurisdictional issues involved.
Commissioner Moreno stated that T!Fs are very important to his district; these TIFs have supported the
parks and schools, and have established industrial parks, which created employment opportunities.
Additionally, TlFs have supported the University of Illinois Extension Center, which has been a positive
factor for economic development. The County should not oversee TIFs; local residents have a greater
ability to respond to them.
Commissioner Quigley delivered the following closing remarks: TIFs affect the future potential growth
of the County's equalized assessment value and where the County can tax. He suggests that TIFs are a
hidden tax hike and most people do not know they exist. The proposed ordinance is an attempt to clarify
a confusing issue. Constituents have a right to know how this money is being spent.

Commissioner.

TAX INCREMENT FINANCE DISTRICT APPROVAL ORDINANCE
WHEREAS, the State of lllinois first authori zed the creation of tax increment finance
(TIF) districts in 1977, to encourage development in blighted areas by using the prospect

75

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 4, 2006

WHEREAS, this diversion of property tax revenue prevents units of government present
in the TIF district from maintaining the same tax rate and using that additional revenue
for services or from lowering tax rates while achieving the same levy; and
WHEREAS, the use ofTIF districts has grown exponentially in Cook County, increasing
from seven in 1984 to 144 in 1994 and to 363 in 2004; and
WHEREAS, TlF districts have a significant fiscal impact on Cook County, di verting
over $49 million in tax revenue from Cook County in 2004 that otherwise would have
been available for county services or would have allowed for a six percent cut in the
property tax rate while achieving the same levy.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of
Commissioners that Chapter 14, Article I, of the Cook County Code is hereby amended
as follows:
Section 14-1. Review of proposed tax increment finance districts
T he County's representative on a tax increment finance (TIF) joint review board of
any municipality within Cook County shall vote as directed by the Board of
Commissioners on the creation, renewal, or extension of any TIF district. Upon
receipt of any TIF study or proposal, the joint review board representative shall
transmit copies of said study or proposal to the Board of Commissioners for referral
to the Finance Committee. If the Board of Commissioners does not take a position
on a TIF proposal prior to the meeting of the joint review board at which such TIF
proposal will be considered, the County's joint review board representative shall
abstain from voting.
*Referred to the Committee on Finance on 06/20/06.
Commissioner Butler, seconded by Commissioner Quigley, moved to defer consideration of

Quigley, County Commissioner; Co-Sponsored by Bobbie L. Steele, President, Earlean
Collins and Anthony J. Peraica, County Commissioners.
PROPOSED ORDINANCE
TAX INCREMENT FINANCE DISTRICT DISCLOSURE ORDINANCE
WHEREAS, a total of $686 million in property tax revenue was captured by tax
increment finance (TIF) districts in Cook County in 2005; and

76

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 4, 2006

WHEREAS, keeping the growth in property value in TIF districts off the tax rolls
effectively narrows the tax base and forces tax rates to be higher than they would
otherwise need to be to generate the same levy amounts; and
WHEREAS, Cook County tax bills identify those properties located in T IF districts, but
do not indicate how much in taxes from each property is distributed to the TIF district;
and
WHEREAS, some parcels, including 77 West Wacker Drive in Chicago, the future
headquarters of United Airlines, pay I 00 percent of their property taxes to the TIF district
in which they are located, even though the amounts shown on the tax bill suggest that
taxing districts such as the County and Forest Preserve District are receiving the revenue;
and
WHEREAS, Cook County taxpayers deserve an accurate accounting of the distribution
of their tax dollars.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of
Commissioners that:
T he County Clerk shall detennine whether a property is located in a tax increment
fi nance (TIF) district, and, if so, shall determine the name of the TIF district in which the
property is located.
For each property located within a TIF district, the County Clerk sha ll calculate the
amount of tax distributed to the taxing districts and to the TJF district. T he County Clerk
shall furni sh these findings to the County Treasurer for use in preparing the secondinstalJment property tax bilJs of affected properties.
The County Treasurer shalJ clearly indicate on second-installment property tax bills
whether a property is located within a TIF distr ict, and, if so, shall identify the T IF
district by name.
On the second-installment property tax bill of each property located within a TIF district,
the County Treasurer shall show the amount of tax distributed to the taxing districts and
to the TIF district.
This Ordinance sha ll take effect on December 3 I, 2007 .

This item was also referred to the Committee on Business and Economic
Development. (See Comm. No. 28 1406).

PROPOSED ORDINANCE

WHEREAS, a total of $686 million in property tax revenue was captured by tax
increment finance (TJF) districts in Cook County in 2005 ; and
WHEREAS, keeping the growth in property value in TIF districts off the tax rolls
effectively narrows the tax base and forces tax rates to be higher than they would

130

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 4, 2006

WHEREAS, Cook County tax bills identify those properties located in TIF districts,
but do not indicate how much in taxes from each property is distributed to the TIF
district; and
WHEREAS, some parcels, including 77 West Wacker Drive in Chicago, the future
headquarters of United Airlines, pay I 00 percent of their property taxes to the TIF
district in which they are located, even though the amounts shown on the tax bill
suggest that taxing districts such as the County and Forest Preserve District are
receiving the revenue; and
WHEREAS, Cook County taxpayers deserve an accurate accounting of the distribution
of their tax dollars.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of
Commissioners that:
The County C lerk shall detennine whether a property is located in a tax increment
finance (TIF) district, and, if so, shall determine the name of the TIF district in which
the property is located.
For each property located within a TIF district, the County Clerk shall calculate the
amount of tax distributed to the taxing districts and to the TIF district. The County
Clerk shall furnish these findings to the County Treasurer for use in preparing the
second-installment property tax bills of affected properties.
The County Treasurer shall clearly indicate on second-installment property tax bills
whether a property is located within a TIF district, and, if so, shall identify the TIF
district by name.
On the second-installment property tax bill of each property located within a TIF
district, the County Treasurer shall show the amount of tax distributed to the taxing
districts and to the TIF district.
This Ordinance shall take effect on December 31, 2007.
NOTE: This item was also referred to the Committee on F inance. (See Comm.
No. 281405).

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 4, 2006

Chainnan Suffredin called the meeting to order and noted that no votes would be taken today. He stated
that the purpose of the meeting is for the people who have been involved in creating the new online
County ordinances to provide infonnation on how to access the ordinances and to answer questions.
James L. Eldridge, Jr., Chief Admini strative Officer, Bureau of Administration, delivered remarks
regarding those involved in the codification of the Cook County Code.
Jerry Pray, Industrial Engineer, Bureau of Administration stated that the first volume deals with
administrative issues, whereas the second volume addresses land use ordinances. Any department that
would like a hard copy, please submit a written request to the Chief Administrative Officer, Bureau of
Administration. There are limited supplies; the volumes are very costly. He strongly recommends
accessing the material online. Inside the front cover of each volume there is a number, this number will
be utilized in forwarding supplements, whether through the Bureau of Administration or a possible future
legislative bureau. The public can purchase hard copies of the code through Municipal Code Corporation
by accessing the County website. The turnaround is about one week. The Bureau of Administration is
contracted to receive supplements on a quarterly basis.
Kathleen Markham, Internet Project Manager, Bureau of Infonnation Technology and Automation, stated
that on www.cookcountygov.com there will be a direct link to www.municode.com which contains the
Cook County Code. All agency pages will also have links directly to relevant ordinances. Each
ordinance will contain an expandable table of contents. There is an extensive search function. There is a
" Show URL" function to share information. There is a link back to the County home page. There is also
a FAQ section . As part of the County's intranet, there will a lso be a network-based option for searching
for an ordinance. This involves installing a small software viewer program to your pc. This software
offers additional functionality such as the ability to extract multiple sections into Microsoft Word. There
will be training for this in October. Updates for the network-based option will be quarterly. However,
the web-based program should be sufficient for most people. Help is available through Municode.
Joy Wykowski, Deputy Clerk of the Board of Commissioners, stated that on page four of the Preface,
there is an explanation of the chapter and section numbering system and also the page numbering system.
The first number is the chapter, separated by a dash, and the second number is the section number. There
is a table explaining the prefix system used for the page numbering system. The number to the right of
the colon represents the number of the page in that portion and the number to the left of the colon
indicates the number of the chapter. Under "General Ordinances," Chapter I, Section 1-3 , provides
definitions and rules of construction as applied in this code. Section I-7 addresses the format of new
ordinances and amendments to the code. There are specific sections on amending the existing code, new
enactments, and repeal of existing code. A ll deleted language of the code should be shown as strikethrough, new language to the code should be underlined. The use of track changes will not be an
accepted fonnat. In the coming week there will be in-service sessions held to assist on these issues.
Chairman Suffredin stated that the County will still have a contract with Municipal Code Corporation to
do the updates. He further stated that Municipal Code Corporation will be receiving post-agenda
documents from the clerk; as new ordinances are passed the update will take place first on the electronic
side and then in the book supplements. He stated that hopefully everyone can start to fonnat ordinances
in such a way as to make matters easier. Chairman Suffredin requested that the users of the new online
code be cognizant of and provide feed back on any di screpancies between this version and the previous
codification, whether it is a missing ordinance or slightly different language. He stated that, for the first
time in over 25 years, the citizens of Cook County have a place on-line to access County law.

Commissioner Daley moved to adjourn the meeting, seconded by Commissioner Sims. The motion
carried and the meeting was adjourned.
