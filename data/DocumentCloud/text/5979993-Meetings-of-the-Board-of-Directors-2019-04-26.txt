long term acute care hospitals).
• Can be fatal in immunocompromised, and strains resistant to medications.

• Training providers on reporting

• Field Operations
• Risk- and harm-reduction counseling of cases, partner services
• HIV cases
• Adolescents with 2 or more STIs in a rolling 12 month window
• Cases where providers could not be reached

 2017 National Data
• US in 4th year of sustained STI increases
• Chlamydia: 1.7 million cases in 2017; 45% among 15- to 24-year-old females
• Gonorrhea diagnoses increased 67 percent between 2013 and 2017
• Primary and secondary syphilis increased 76 percent;

Men who have sex with men (MSM) made up ~70% percent of cases

 “We are sliding backward,” said Jonathan Mermin, M.D., M.P.H, director of CDC’s National Center for HIV/AIDS,
Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention. “It is evident the systems that identify, treat, and ultimately prevent
STDs are strained to near-breaking point.”

STI Initiatives
• Community/Patient-based approaches
• Infrastructure changes

• Provider-based approaches

18

 Cook County Health
HIV/STI Services Coordination/Integration Committee
STI Campaign Activities (in process)
• Ambulatory Community Health Network health centers:
• Walk in patients for STI screening and treatment at all health centers
• First visit no charge, including treatment. Then enroll with a primary care provider.

• Key messages
•
•
•
•

Chlamydia and gonorrhea are most frequently reported; 2/3 of cases are ages 19-24 years old
Get tested. (We will only test for GC/Chlamydia.)
Get treated. (You and your partners.)
Prevent STIs. (Condoms, communication, etc.)

• We will provide information about other diseases (HIV, syphilis,
Hepatitis B and C, HPV)

21

 Strategies
• Website (www.dontguessgetatest.com)
• Partners (social media sites and clients/members)
• Print materials (posters, flyers, wallet cards, fact sheets) and swag
(pop sockets, lip moisturizer, aluminum water bottles, microfiber pouch, sunglasses)
• Earned media (radio or TV PSAs, interviews)

23

 Infrastructure Changes
• Electronic case reporting
• Intra-facility STI testing reports
• CCH
• Loyola
• Ingalls

24

 STI Reporting Form
• Make electronic
• Pull info from EMR and lab
• Automatic routing to Local and State Health Depts.

25

 Provider-based Approaches
• Detailed and (non-judgmental!) sexual history on ALL PATIENTS WHO ARE SEXUALLY ACTIVE
• Ensure correct treatment is prescribed and taken by patient
• Expedited Partner Therapy
