PROPOSED RESOLUTION
HONORING THE ‘TIME’S UP’ MOVEMENT
WHEREAS, TIME’S UP launched on January 1, 2018 as a unified call for change from women in
entertainment for women everywhere. From movie sets to farm fields to legislatures alike, TIME’S UP
envisions nationwide leadership that reflects the world in which we live; and,
WHEREAS, TIME’S UP stands with all those who have endured sexual harassment: those who have
come forward and those who have decided to remain quiet; and,
WHEREAS, Powered by women, TIME’S UP addresses the systemic inequality and injustice in the
workplace that have kept underrepresented groups from reaching their full potential; and,
WHEREAS, Sexual harassment is pervasive across industries, but especially in low-wage service jobs.
For example, more than 25% of sexual harassment charges filed with the EEOC in the last decade came
from industries with service-sector workers; and,
WHEREAS, TIME’S UP partners with leading advocates for equality and safety to improve laws,
employment agreements, and corporate policies; help change the face of corporate boardrooms and the
C-suite; and enable more women and men to access our legal system to hold wrongdoers accountable;
and,
WHEREAS, TIME'S UP Legal Defense Fund provides subsidized legal support to women and men who
have experienced sexual harassment, assault, or abuse in the workplace and while in pursuit of their
careers; and,
WHEREAS, The time is up for silence; and,
WHEREAS, The time is up for waiting; and,
WHEREAS, The time is up for tolerance for discrimination, harassment or abuse.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, That the Cook County Board of Commissioners salutes
the women who founded TIME’S UP and that Cook County recognizes the importance of ending sexual
assault, harassment and inequality in the workplace.

HONORING UPTOWN’S CORNERSTONE COMMUNITY OUTREACH
WHEREAS, Cornerstone Community Outreach (CCO) is a Illinois not-for-profit organization, founded in
1989, to raise the quality of life for low-income residents in the Uptown area of Chicago; and,
WHEREAS, since its founding, CCO has welcomed Chicago’s homeless residents to provide shelter to
families, single women and single men by providing a safe place for residents to recover from the streets
and to move toward permanent housing and self-sufficiency; and,
WHEREAS, CCO’s programs serve nearly 500 men, women and children daily and with Cornerstone’s
help these families and individuals can begin to build a new life, one step at a time; and,
WHEREAS, Many neighbors come to CCO with very little clothing for themselves and their children,
therefore CCO allows neighbors and shelter residents to shop for essential clothing and household items at
their Free Store; and,
WHEREAS, CCO’s Dinner Guest Program serves a free nutritious meal to 100-150 of their low-income
neighbors every Saturday to allow individuals to fellowship and create community together; and,

mental-health needs of its residents; and,
WHEREAS, Parenting, life-skills, and computer classes are provided through CCO and give a safe place
to share life experiences, gain new tools to rebuild their lives, allow residents to create resumes, improve
typing skills, and explore the internet for employment and housing opportunities; and,
WHEREAS, CCO residents ages 5-12 attend the after-school program three afternoons a week which
offers tutoring, educational encouragement and a safe, fun environment.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners
commends Cornerstone Community Outreach for the work it does for Chicagoland residents and to make
Uptown and its surrounding communities a more healthy and productive place to live.
