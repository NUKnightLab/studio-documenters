National Child Abuse Prevention Month
Cuyahoga County Calls on all Residents to Help Prevent Child Abuse

Throughout April, National Child Abuse Prevention Month, Cuyahoga County?s Division of
Children and Family Services will engage our community to help prevent abuse, recognize signs
of abuse, and learn what to do when abuse is suspected. Activities include a community
gathering in Public Square, a training for mandated reporters, an event at the Strongsville Mall,
and more.

The County is also joining the painted rock craze, painting and distributing blue rocks around
the area for residents to find. The 570 rocks, symbolizing the number of children in permanent
County custody, will each display the hashtag #CuyahogaHero, encouraging finders to go online
and learn more about preventing child abuse.

Anyone who knows of or suspects child abuse or neglect, or would like to refer a family for
services, should call 216-696-KID8 for help. Visit 
to learn more about the signs of child abuse and neglect.
