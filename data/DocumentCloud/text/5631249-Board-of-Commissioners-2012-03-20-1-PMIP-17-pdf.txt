General Bac ound
The Property Manager?s Insurance Program, known as PMIP, is a CHA controlled
insurance program that ensures that the Authority has the necessary insurance protection
for general liabilities associated with the management of its housing portfolio. This
program provides the most cost effective insurance solution for the portfolio, while
maintaining coverage standards that are difficult for property management ?rms to
procure individually.

All costs associated with the program insurance premiums, claim and broker
administration fees), are deducted from the participating Private Property Management
Firm?s operating budgets.

participation has been waived, as currently there are no
insurance companies that can meet standard criteria. Insurance
providers must possess assets in excess of $1 billion and carry a minimum rating of 
by the A.M. Best Rating Guide; this is equivalent to an excellent credit rating for an
insurer.

Pre-Plan For Transformation History
Prior to the Plan For Transformation, the general liability risks of the Authority were, at

times, uninsurable. In 1985 and 1986, the Chicago Housing Authority had been without
Excess General Liability, Auto Liability, and Public Of?cials Liability insurance because
of cancellation of these policies. In Spite of attempts to acquire replacement coverage,
none was available. Other housing authorities were also without these coverages. In
order to secure some semblance of coverage, the Chicago Housing Authority joined other
housing authorities and procured insurance as part of the Housing Authority Risk
Retention Group in 1987. This group provided an opportunity for PHAs to secure these
necessary insurance coverages.

PET Impact on Insurance Procurement
The Plan For Transformation (PFT) paved the way for considerable improvement in

living conditions for CHA residents. Densely populated high-rise developments that
were not only dif?cult to maintain, but did not sustain safe living environments, were

r[Jinx-3.? 4.: E'r vurzzartf; J?i'ilfc- 5.. 14,75? an w? - ?by. 

razed. A direct result of the PFT was a dramatic improvement in living conditions as
well as improved claims experience throughout the portfolio.

As part of the PFT, a decision was made to outsource property management functions to
private ?rms. As part of this process, management liabilities were contractually
transferred away from the Authority to the Private Property Managers (PPM). PPMs thus
became responsible for procuring general liability insurance, among other coverages.
Inconsistencies in coverage obtained by PPMs, including inferior policy forms, varying
retention levels, and high costs leading to non-payment and cancellation of coverage,
resulted in almost no success in tendering claims to the PPM insurers. The resulting
claims and litigation expense then fell back to the Authority and CHA faced substantial
exposure.

PMIP Development 1999-2008
The Private Manager?s Insurance Program (PMIP) was designed in 1999 to afford

insurance coverage for the property management operations of the Chicago Housing
Authority. The program is considered an ?owner controlled insurance program?, allowing
the Authority to use its economies of scale to purchase coverage in the commercial
insurance marketplace, and direct coverage necessary to protect the interests of the
Authority. This program allowed Cl-lA to insure all of its properties.

However, The exposures remained expensive to insure because of many factors,
even when globally procured. The general condition of the portfolio, crime, and serious
injury proved dif?cult to control for the ?fteen (15) different management ?rms, which
resulted in poor and unpro?table loss experience for insurers. As a result, CHA paid
expensive premiums and faced a $750,000 self insured retention for each claim.

PMIP 2008 - Current

In 2008, the number of PPM ?rms managing the assets was reduced from ?fteen to ?ve.
This was a strategy that allowed the top-performing ?rms to provide better management
of CHA assets from an operational and safety control perspective. The drastic change in
the portfolio composition led to substantial improvement of the physical portfolio and
claims experience. The number of claims and amounts paid began to decline, and as a
result, the Authority began to attract more attention from insurers. Improved physical
attributes as well as reduced claims activity were contributing factors.

In 2009, the scope of coverage for the PMIP was reduced, which resulted in further
reductions of expense. Prior to this policy period, Workers? Compensation and Auto
Liability exposures were covered by PMIP. All property management contracts were
renegotiated to transfer WC and Auto Liability exposures to the PPMs.

In 2010, competition from insurers proved to bene?t the Authority with lowered
premiums by 32%, and reduced per-claim retentions (deductible) from $750,000 to
$250,000. Although this carrier insured the CHA for only one year, resulting reductions
in premium and retention levels have been maintained.

Cost and Feasibilig of PMIP
In 2010, the CHA again explored the feasibility of the PMIP by tasking the PPM ?rms to

obtain individual quotes for their managed portfolio. The feasibility analysis was
performed in conjunction with insurance broker, AON, Legal, Finance,
Risk and Asset Management departments, and the PPM ?rms. The PPMs were given
coverage speci?cations to secure these quotes for coverage.

Quotes received by the PPMs had inconsistent and unfavorable coverage terms, and
several ?rms were unable to secure quotes for the Authority?s high risks. The PMIP
approach showed that the insurance expense was approximately $900,000 or 30% less
than what the individual PPMs were quoted. Coverage inconsistencies and varying
retentions inherent in coverage sought by the PPMs was also viewed as problematic. As
a result, CHA elected to continue the PMIP program.

Recent benchmarking data versus private sector companies do show that the Authority?s
cost for Excess and Umbrella coverages are more expensive when compared to private
companies. Public Housing Authorities pose extremely dif?cult risks to insure, and also
unique in that the exposure is multi-family and senior only, as opposed to other large real
estate ?rms whose insurable exposures may be diluted by of?ce, retail, hospitality, and
industrial risks.

The Property Managers Insurance Program remained the most cost effective solution for
General Liability coverage in the insurance market, and the liability exposures of both the
Authority and Private Property Managers can be controlled.

Renewal Stratm'es and Procurement
Both AON and CHA Risk Management have made concerted efforts to increase the

marketability of the Authority?s PMIP program to insurers. Property tours were
conducted with underwriters; portfolio composition information was presented in formats
previously unavailable; and, internal claims information and analysis were provided to
the insurers.

Most interested insurers are surplus lines carriers, who insure high risk entities. The
program received limited interest from admitted insurers, who have less appetite for risk
but generally more favorable pricing. Although the current renewal has garnered attention
from new insurance carriers, willing participants were unable to meet expiring pricing
and retention levels. Insurers that could not meet expiring pricing targets chose to not
incur underwriting costs and therefore did not submit quotes, even though our exposures
were within their underwriting guidelines. Entities such as the Housing Authority Risk
Retention Group (HARRG) have previously declined to quote CHA exposures as their
focus is now on small to mid-size public housing authorities.

Consequently, CHA was able to secure only one quote for the primary layer of General

Liability coverage (with reduced pricing from expiring year), one quote for the Excess
layer of Liability coverage, and two quotes for the Umbrella layer of liability coverage"an, g.

As the Plan For Transformation matures, along with improving claims experience,
implementation and focus on risk control programs, the Chicago Housing Authority
should bene?t in future renewals as insurers become more comfortable with CHA
exposures.

Year Over Year Cost Comparison
The chart outlines a six (6) year history of the PMIP premiums. The coverage limit has

remained constant with a $22 million general aggregate limit of coverage. Self Insured
Retentions (SIR), or deductible per occurrence, is identi?ed as well as the insurer
providing coverage for each year.

PROCUREMENT HISTORY

Aon directly and indirectly (through one wholesaler) solicited requests for insurance
premium quotes from 18 insurance carriers in January 2012 and requested that their
quotes be submitted to Aon in early February 2012. The incumbent general liability
carrier, First Specialty, was the only insurance company to submit a premium quote for
the general liability primary coverage layer, but also expanded coverage for certain
pollution perils with a slight decrease in pricing, $541,828 v. $549,080 for the contract
year about to expire. All other insurers declined to provide premium quotes for 
PMIP due to the class of business (multi-family and public housing), inability to meet
expiring pricing or non-competitive retention levels.

The incumbent carrier for the excess liability layer, Illinois Union, offered to renew at the
same premium amount, $475,524, and was also the only insurer to provide a quote for
this layer of coverage. CHA received two quotes for the Umbrella Liability layers, one
from incumbent carrier, AXIS, and also AWAC. AXIS will be replaced by AWAC,
which offered the same coverage at a $10,000 savings with a premium cost of $186,480.
The aggregate total premium is $1,203,832, representing an overall decrease of 1.4% in
premium costs for the PMIP program from the previous contract year.

Based on the foregoing, it is in the best interest of the CHA to enter into contracts with
First Specialty Insurance Company for general liability, Illinois Union for excess
liability, and AWAC, in the aggregate amount of $1 ,203,832 for the PMIP for the
period oprril 1, 2012 through March 31, 2013M25 Vannumn smw- war ?ax-.3 -
