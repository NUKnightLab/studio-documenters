Submitting report relative to Police Surveillance and Facial Recognition
Technology. (Even identifying an accurate and clear understanding of how
facial recognition technology actually works is much more difficult than might
be expected. The technology has multiple formats and is used for many other
things besides law enforcement investigations. One scientific source generically
describes the function as follows: “Facial recognition is an advanced
technology that helps in discerning and identifying human faces from an image
or video. A system employed to perform facial recognition uses biometrics to
map facial features from the photo or video. It compares this information with
a large database of recorded faces to find a correct match.”)
