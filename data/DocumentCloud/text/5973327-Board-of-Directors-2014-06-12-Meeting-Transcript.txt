CHAIRMAN BELL:

If I can get everyone to

take their seats so we can get started.

Thank you.

3

I'd like to call the meeting to

4

order, and I want to welcome all of you to our

5

June 12th meeting.

6

We have a pretty full agenda.

7

Obviously most of it will be in our executive

8

session as we talk about sensitive procurement

9

proposal information.

But we do want to jump right

10

in and deal with the things in our open meeting

11

first, and we'll again adjourn for executive

12

session.

13

Let's just start with the

14

organizational matters.

15

is the approval of the last meeting minutes.

16

MR. BEITLER:

First and foremost, this

Mr. Chairman, before we do

17

that, if you don't mind, if we could just check if

18

anybody's on the phone.

CHAIRMAN BELL:

I thought you had done

that.
MR. BEITLER:

Anybody on the phone?
(No response.)

All right.

Thank you.

UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:

Damon Silvers is

going to attend in a few minutes.

CHAIRMAN BELL:
All right.

4
5

Damon will be there.

Any comments, questions, changes to
the minutes?

6

(No response.)

7

Not hearing any, do I have a motion?

8

ALDERMAN POPE:

9

MS. FERGUSON:

10

CHAIRMAN BELL:

So moved.
Second.

11

is the contracting manual.

12

revisions.

13
14
15

Second item of business
There were a few

You want to walk us through them,
Steve?
MR. BEITLER:

Mr. Chairman, basically as

16

part of the procedure for unsolicited and

17

collaborative proposals, we are allowing a meeting

18

basically with the Trust staff to discuss the

19

proposal prior to final bid, so we just are

20

memorializing that in the manual, and we have some

21

grammatical edits that we caught, and those are the

22

only two changes.

23
24

CHAIRMAN BELL:

It may seem like we're

having revisions every meeting, but we said upfront

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 4
1

that this is a living document, so it will have to

2

change and be revised and reflect what we're

3

actually experiencing.

4

Any comments, questions?

5

(No response.)

6

Do I have a motion?

7

MS. FERGUSON:

8

ALDERMAN POPE:

Seconded.

9

CHAIRMAN BELL:

All in favor.

10

MS. FERGUSON:

11

ALDERMAN POPE:

Aye.

12

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Okay.

13

So moved.

Aye.

Why don't you

walk us through the IRS Form 990, Steve?

14

MR. BEITLER:

Vivian.

15

MS. FUNCHES:

The 990 represents the

16

information at the end of the fiscal period 12-31

17

2013, and it was due May the 15th which has been

18

extended to August the 15th.

19

It shows our total revenue and

20

expenses that we went over back in December which

21

is currently under audit.

22

extension is so that we can have our audited

23

financial statements which we don't expect any

24

audit adjustments, so the numbers should not

The reason for the

McGuire's Reporting Service

 Page 5

2

change.
So hopefully you guys had an

3

opportunity to review it, and I will take questions

4

or if there's anything in particular you want to

5

discuss in the 990, I'll take questions.

6
7
8
9

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Any questions or

comments on the 990?
Scott.
MR. FALK:

Mr. Chairman, the one thing I

10

would just make -- I'd want to alert the Board to

11

the fact that as we start to hire more employees

12

there's going to be an obligation to describe in

13

the 990 how it is that the Board has determined the

14

compensation paid to the individual employees is

15

reasonable under IRS guidelines and not excessive.

16

And the IRS, as people know, has

17

been cracking down on high salaries paid to

18

non-profit leadership.

19

That's not an issue for us.

But, nevertheless, we'll need -- at

20

some point once we get above the threshold we'll

21

need to have the Board have a finding that the

22

compensation in the aggregate is reasonable, and

23

the way you determine that is by reference to other

24

similarly situated charities and how they pay their

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 6
1

people, make sure we're within a range of normalcy.

2

But that's not an issue for this year's first 990.

3

It may well be an issue for next year.

4
5

CHAIRMAN BELL:

We don't need to do it

for Steve's salary?

6

MR. FALK:

No, sir.

7

MS. FUNCHES:

And the other thing that

8

he's referencing is all the checklist

9

questionnaires that the Board is responsible for

10

making sure that those procedures and policies are

11

in place, so you all want to pay close attention to

12

those checklist questionnaires.

13
14

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Any other

comments or questions with regard to the 990?

15
16

Okay.

(No response.)
Do I have a motion?

17

ALDERMAN POPE:

18

MS. FERGUSON:

19

CHAIRMAN BELL:

All in favor.

20

ALDERMAN POPE:

Aye.

21

MS. FERGUSON:

22

CHAIRMAN BELL:

23

MR. BEITLER:

24

So moved.
Second.

Aye.
Okay.

Mr. Chairman, basically I

wanted to get the Board's concurrence for -- if

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 7
1

there was a different approach.

We've been

2

scheduling our Board meetings on a quarterly basis.

3

We have had to schedule a couple of additional

4

Board meetings, and I thought I would recommend

5

that we continue to schedule the Board meetings on

6

a quarterly basis but essentially schedule a straw

7

meeting, for lack of a better term, in the

8

intervening months and then set up a methodology by

9

which we make a decision as to whether or not we

10

need that particular date and then either decide to

11

hold it or cancel it but at least have knowledge

12

that the Board is available on a particular date.

13
14
15

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Do you have a date in

mind?
MR. BEITLER:

No.

We'll send out a poll

16

to all the Board members to get concurrence on

17

dates for the next year's schedule because our last

18

scheduled Board meeting is in October.

19

CHAIRMAN BELL:

So, Steve, do you think

20

that it's still sufficient to meet quarterly or

21

should we be looking at every two months or --

22

MR. BEITLER:

It would be -- I mean at

23

the current pace, we are more on a -- I don't know

24

if bimonthly but every two month schedule.

We do

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 8
1

appear to be headed in that direction.

2
3

CHAIRMAN BELL:

So why don't we send

that around?

4

MR. BEITLER:

Okay.

5

CHAIRMAN BELL:

And see if we can get

6

that, get that on the calendar because I think it's

7

better for us to plan and cancel than to try to

8

schedule one.

9

If we think the volume right now is

10

driving, you know, it's looking at meeting every

11

couple months, let's plan accordingly, and we can

12

back off of it.

13

you know, we didn't have much going on, but now we

14

do have.

15

probably need to talk about them sooner than give

16

you some support whether or not we think we want to

17

go forward with some of these projects before we

18

spend a lot of resources.

19

We went to quarterly because we,

We've got a lot on the plate.

MR. BEITLER:

Then we'll send out a poll

20

for the every two months meeting and get

21

concurrence on that.

22

CHAIRMAN BELL:

23

MR. BEITLER:

24

We

All right.

Thank you.

So, Mr. Chairman, that would take us

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 9
1

into the update that Claire Tramm will provide on

2

aquatic facilities.

3

CHAIRMAN BELL:

4

MS. TRAMM:

Okay.

All right.

5

turn to Page 9.

6

the slide before.

7

Facilities Retrofit Project.

8
9

Claire.
So if you'll

This is just a review.

We've seen

It's an overview of Aquatic

We are recommending that we go
forward with an energy services agreement again

10

which was the exact same format as Retrofit 1, and

11

I think we're very well suited at the Trust to

12

facilitate.

13

Page 10 just talks about the

14

sequence of events that we have heretofore gone

15

through starting with the unsolicited proposal for

16

this project which was received January 3rd, and

17

then we proceeded to an open bidding process per

18

our procurement manual standards as of March 26th.

19

That closed on May 2nd, and then we proceeded to an

20

additional question period which lasted until last

21

Thursday.

22

Page 11 just talks about going

23

forward and then looking back for the last week

24

after we closed that additional question period

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 10
1

what are the schedule of meetings that we have to

2

go through to actually sign documents and make this

3

project a reality.

4

So starting last Friday we

5

syndicated this with the City and the Schools'

6

leadership.

7

Yesterday we syndicated with the

8

Parks' leadership and the Water Department's

9

leadership.

10

We're also working on scheduling a

11

meeting with the Chicago Housing Authority

12

leadership who needs to sign off on some of the

13

pools that the Parks operate.

14

Pending your approval of the project

15

today we'll proceed to everything else on there --

16

City Council, Parks and School Board approval and

17

then hopefully be able to execute the contingent

18

investment grade audit documents which will be the

19

first agreement we sign in mid August.

20

So Page 12, this just talks about

21

the basic description of the structure, so, again,

22

it's the Energy Services Agreement.

23

and zero net cost to our clients, in this case

24

Schools and Parks.

Zero upfront,

It's off credit financing as

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 11
1

well as tax exempt debt used to finance this.

2

Let's talk a little bit more about

3

the benefits.

4

park facilities with pools in them.

5

are located across 48 wards, and we'll show you the

6

maps of the distribution of these pools in a few

7

slides.

8
9

So we're looking at 141 school and
These pools

The first $20,000,000 will -- in
this project will create about 100 to 200 jobs, and

10

we're aiming for a maximum of about 20 percent

11

energy savings reductions in these.

12

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Claire, where will the

13

jobs be created?

Will they be in the companies

14

doing the work or the City or --

15

MS. TRAMM:

Mostly in the construction

16

partners that we're choosing, and they have clear

17

standards to meet in terms of MBE/WBE which they

18

have agreed to meet or exceed.

19

CHAIRMAN BELL:

20

MS. TRAMM:

21

So we get to drive that?

Exactly.

We get to drive

that.

22

ALDERMAN POPE:

Mr. Chairman.

23

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Yes.

24

ALDERMAN POPE:

Claire, can you

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 12
1

describe or in the future provide information on

2

not just the number of jobs but the work hours -- I

3

think we've done that in the past -- so we have a

4

more accurate understanding of how many hours of

5

work are being performed on these projects?

6
7

MS. TRAMM:

Will

do.

8
9

That's a great idea.

So I think actually one of the most
critical slides is Page 13, the next slide.

So I

10

want to highlight for you some of the key

11

differences of this project with Retrofit 1 because

12

as you saw on the previous page, we don't actually

13

know what the savings number is yet.

14

don't know the savings number yet is because we are

15

including our investment grade audit within the

16

transaction this time.

17

paid and fronted the cost for the investment grade

18

audit.

19

The reason we

Whereas, last time the City

In this case, we are actually

20

bringing it into the contracting process for the --

21

for this transaction, so it has not yet been done.

22

We have identified a list of

23

measures that will be eligible for our contract

24

partner to look at in all 141 pools, and we hope to

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 13
1

be able to do cost effective upgrades on all 141

2

pools, but we won't know the total numbers until

3

we've done that.

4

CHAIRMAN BELL:

So, Claire, let's say --

5

then we can't conclude the negotiations until that

6

audit is done and fully understand that?

7

MS. TRAMM:

No.

What we're going to do

8

is proceed with what's called a contingent

9

investment grade audit, so we'll have clear terms

10

in it that state if a project of X dollar size is

11

found and you agree to finance it or you agree that

12

financing will be found at Y rate, then we will go

13

ahead and proceed with the work.

14

either of those conditions are not met, the

15

financing can't be found at a reasonable price or

16

the project is not found, we don't pay for the

17

investment grade audit.

18

a series of contingent contracts here that will

19

allow the project to go forward from the moment

20

that we start this investment grade audit.

21
22
23
24

If you -- if

We're essentially creating

ALDERMAN POPE:

How soon do you think

the soonest start would be?
MS. TRAMM:

August 18th for the actual

work in evaluating the Schools and Park District's

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 14
1

buildings.

2

ALDERMAN POPE:

But with the

3

contingencies how quickly do you think the physical

4

work?

5
6

MS. TRAMM:

We think the work could

start as early as the beginning of 2015.

7

ALDERMAN POPE:

8

MS. TRAMM:

9
10

Great.

Potentially earlier.

So I think that's the major contrast
I wanted to highlight.

11

Also, we have a bit of a different

12

structure in terms of our partnerships.

13

recommending one contractor rather than three in

14

this case, and then we'll have two building owners,

15

the Parks and the Schools, and four property

16

owners.

17

the Water Department have to give their sign off

18

for these things to be done on their property.

19

We'll be

I mentioned Housing Authority as well as

CHAIRMAN BELL:

So one contractor

20

because they're providing the financing quite

21

frankly?

22

MS. TRAMM:

In this case, the contractor

23

that we're selecting at this point can work with us

24

to find the financing.

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 15
1

CHAIRMAN BELL:

I guess the question

2

there -- are we comfortable we can meet the City's

3

requirements on having competition and I mean is

4

this -- how do we deal with one contractor and make

5

sure we don't put ourselves or the City in a

6

position that we haven't met some due diligence

7

test of having a competitive bid for the

8

construction work?

9

MS. TRAMM:

We're going to get into this

10

in closed session because it is a matter of

11

procurement.

12

receive several other bids in response to our open

13

bidding process, so we feel that it was a

14

competitive process, and then within those bids,

15

which all of them included obviously some sort of

16

energy service company, traditional engineering and

17

contractor company, all of them also partnered with

18

at least one, sometimes many financiers and found

19

ways to do that financing procurement.

20

However, I can say that we did

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Now is the City

21

comfortable with that also?

22

discussion?

23
24

MR. BEITLER:

Have we had this

The City and the Trust

have been working closely together to do this

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 16
1

particular project.

2

work that has to be done, but the City is aware of

3

all the facets of this project and the City's

4

requirements to accomplish this project.

5

is in the process of meeting.

6

way of saying yes, we're working together.

7

There is considerable more

CHAIRMAN BELL:

That's a long-winded

That's not quite the

8

question.

9

I mean I know we're working together.

10
11

The Trust

The question was are they comfortable.

MS. TRAMM:

Everyone left Friday's

meeting very, very pleased I would say.

12

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Because this is the

13

structure.

14

is what I think you're gonna recommend to us after

15

we walk through this.

16

This is what we're saying it is.

MR. BEITLER:

Right.

This

So where there's

17

more work that has to be done is essentially

18

pertaining to what are the items that actually get

19

implemented in a building at a pool and what are

20

the items that shouldn't be implemented because say

21

the Park's department says, gee, that's not a good

22

idea for these reasons.

23

have been done yet.

24

in the future anyway.

That's work that would not

That's work that would be done

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 17
1

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Yeah, that part I

2

understand.

3

beginning of the project we settle on one

4

contractor and that's it.

5
6

It's just the issue of at the

MR. BEITLER:

Everybody's on the same

page.

7

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Everybody has to --

8

that's the way this thing is structured.

9

the way the proposal or the project is -- the only

10

way people are interested in doing it, and we just

11

need to make sure that meets whatever criteria we

12

have for having competitive bids on construction

13

work.

14

MR. BEITLER:

That's

So we have conducted a

15

competitive bid at this point.

16

unsolicited proposal.

17

process.

18

proceed into executive session recommend a

19

selection.

20

We received an

We went to an open bid

Other companies bid, and we will as we

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Okay.

I just want to be

21

sure Winters is -- like understands this, is

22

comfortable with this.

23

don't want us to get downstream here and then we've

24

got an issue that may scuttle the deal if we have

Make sure that -- I mean I

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 18
1

to go out and compete each of the projects.

2
3

MR. BEITLER:

No.

our rules and the City rules that apply to us.

4

CHAIRMAN BELL:

5

MR. BEITLER:

6

Okay.

And we've held an open,

competitive process.

7
8

We followed all of

MS. TRAMM:

Yeah, we're following all of

the letters of our procurement manual.

9

In the case of both Schools and

10

Parks, they are contracting with us.

11

finding the debt.

12

structure of the deal too, it's really up to us to

13

find the best rate and compete out the bid as we

14

see fit.

When you think about the

15

CHAIRMAN BELL:

16

MS. TRAMM:

17

again.

18

already.

19

We are

Okay.

And we have syndicated

As I mentioned, we had those three meetings

So I think I'll just wrap up Page 13

20

by saying this is a more industry standard

21

methodology which we're excited to apply, and it

22

takes a lot of the risk off, for the investment

23

grade audit phase off of us.

24

So Page 14 just shows that

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 19
1

throughout every step of this process, from project

2

development through the investment grade audit

3

phase to construction and then later ongoing

4

management after the project closes and is fully

5

constructed, the Trust is playing really an end to

6

end support role.

7

a little bit over time, but this will be, you know,

8

essentially a more extensive role even than in

9

Retrofit 1.

You can see how our roles change

10

Page 15 just shows you a map of all

11

of the 141 pools across the City and all the wards

12

that they are in.

13

50 wards.

14

Again, they cover 48 out of the

And then you can see on Pages 16 and

15

17 this broken out by the Chicago Public Schools

16

first and then the Park District.

17

Page 18 just takes a look at which

18

upgrades we're looking at in each of the buildings,

19

and it's a little bit more extensive than I believe

20

what was looked at for Retrofit 1, and that will be

21

not just looking at pool efficiency.

22

looking at the same types of things we looked at

23

for Retrofit 1 which is facility efficiency.

24

We'll be

Then we've added some things on at

the end -- solar thermal, solar PV, demand response

2

as well as combined heat and power which with the

3

subsidies that are newly available from the State

4

may actually break even for the first time.

5

that's exciting stuff.

6

things in all 141 pools.

7

So

We'll look for all of those

Then the remaining four or five

8

slides are just revisiting the structure of an ESA

9

to refresh your memory from Retrofit 1.

Again, the

10

goal is to bring down the total amount of energy

11

spent and have that amount of savings both be

12

shared with the client, in this case schools and

13

parks that we are serving, as well as repaying the

14

principal and interest on our debt.

15

CHAIRMAN BELL:

So to summarize though,

16

the City -- what the City gets out of this is

17

upgraded pools, public pool facilities at a lower

18

operating cost going forward?

19

MS. TRAMM:

Exactly.

20

CHAIRMAN BELL:

And not have to front

21

the monies for those modifications and they do

22

retain title to them at the end of this whole

23

thing?

24

MS. TRAMM:

Exactly.

CHAIRMAN BELL:

2

MS. TRAMM:

Okay.

All right.

I believe you've seen the

3

structural schematic of how this transaction works,

4

so I won't go over that one.

5

I believe you've also seen the slide

6

in terms of why this is not a parking meters type

7

deal.

8

the risk so that we keep the upside not our

9

investment partners.

We really thought about how we structured

10

And then finally just a few of the

11

unique terms that keep this an off credit, off

12

balance sheet type of transaction.

13
14

So I think we'll proceed to project
approval.

15

Do we want to call for --

16

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Let me talk a little bit

17

about this.

18

we -- what process the Board has that somehow

19

approved the project that the Trust goes forward

20

with.

21

You know, we have been discussing how

Scott, I understand this is not a

22

legal definition, but it is a process issue that,

23

you know, I'm not so sure we fully ironed out, but

24

until we do so I've asked Steve to put this chart

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 22
1

in here so that the Board, one, satisfies itself

2

this project is clearly in the interest of the City

3

and its citizens.

4

that to us.

5

I think you guys just explained

Two, that a project like this

6

doesn't fit traditional funding models that the

7

City can employ and not have to engage the Trust to

8

go out and raise money at a cheaper cost.

9

think we're going to hear that's not the case.

And I
I

10

mean this is a more cost effective way to do it to

11

benefit the City.

12

And, thirdly, that we do have some

13

control over the number of things that are coming

14

to us given the resource constraints we have.

15

just gotta decide as a Board how we prioritize

16

things, and there are a lot of things that I think

17

the staff is getting, some of which we just don't

18

have the capacities or the resources to pursue, so

19

we need to figure out how to do that.

20

I've asked Steve to put this in here that we first

21

approve that we're gonna adopt this project as a

22

Trust.

23
24

MR. BEITLER:

We

That's why

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

If I may, you may also want to

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 23
1

discuss the composition of the Board today prior to

2

taking a vote.

3

CHAIRMAN BELL:

4

I do.

I do.

You might notice David is not here.

5

David Hoffman is not here.

6

representing one of the offerers in the pool

7

project.

8

would be better he recused himself from everything.

9

I'm not so sure he had to recuse himself for this

10

public part where we decide to go forward with the

11

project, but at the end of the day, we just wanted

12

to make sure that and when this thing all sorts out

13

that there is no perception at all of some

14

impropriety because his firm, even though David is

15

not one of the owners on the, on this particular

16

account, but his firm is obviously doing that.

17

just wanted to be as transparent as possible that

18

he's not been involved in either deciding to go

19

forward with the project or in the selection of the

20

preferred offeree, so we decided he just wouldn't

21

be at the meeting.

22
23
24

His firm is

He and I talked, and we both felt that it

Okay.

We

Any questions or comments

from anybody on the Board or anyone else?
MS. FERGUSON:

Claire, can you go back

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 24
1

for a quick second to 21 and just remind me how on

2

the far right hand bar, the 2,000,000 of benefit,

3

savings, how is that being split or what's the

4

methodology by which the City and the Trust share

5

in that upside?

6

Just remind me.

MS. TRAMM:

So right now I believe for

7

payments over a certain amount or an excess savings

8

over a certain amount we're prepaying the loan

9

essentially on the City's behalf, and then the

10

Trust retains the remainder.

11

MR. BEITLER:

It's on a case-by-case

12

basis.

We haven't made a determination yet for

13

this particular transaction as to how we should do

14

it but in the past transaction.

15

MS. FERGUSON:

16

CHAIRMAN BELL:

17
18

Okay.

Thank you.

Any other comments?

(No response.)
So do I have a motion?

19

ALDERMAN POPE:

So moved.

20

MS. FERGUSON:

21

CHAIRMAN BELL:

All in favor.

22

ALDERMAN POPE:

Aye.

23

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Aye.

24

MR. BEITLER:

Second.

Okay.

Mr. Chairman, would you

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 25

care to call for public comments?
CHAIRMAN BELL:

got a call from a Mr. Tim Clue.

4

MR. BEITLER:

CHAIRMAN BELL:

11
12
13

I think you

Is he here?

I don't know if he's here.
Is he present?

(No response.)
Are there any others that would care
to make a public comment at this time?

9
10

I would.

(No response.)
Not hearing any, I think we move on.
MR. BEITLER:

So then I would ask that

we move into executive session.
CHAIRMAN BELL:

Before doing that,

14

Scott, would you cite the provision in the Open

15

Meetings Act that would cover us and what we'll be

16

doing today in this executive session?

17

MR. FALK:

The Board is permitted to but

18

is not required to close a meeting for a specific

19

set of enumerated reasons under the Illinois Open

20

Meetings Act, so if you choose to do so, you will

21

need to have a motion to close the meeting.

22

The particular provision of the Open

23

Meetings Act we're relying on for today's closed

24

session is Section 2C7 which relates to the

McGuire's Reporting Service
(312) 346-0911 (FAX) (312) 346-0988

 Page 26
1

negotiation, sale and purchase of investments or

2

financing contracts.

3

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Okay.

All right.

I'm

4

going to ask for a motion to close the meeting.

5

will come back into open session after the closed

6

session should anyone care to join us after we

7

conclude the executive session.

8

So a motion?

9

MS. FERGUSON:

10

ALDERMAN POPE:

Seconded.

11

CHAIRMAN BELL:

All in favor.

12

ALDERMAN POPE:

13

CHAIRMAN BELL:

14

MR. BEITLER:

15
16

We

So moved.

Aye.
Aye.

So we would ask members of

the public to please leave the room.
(WHEREUPON, the meeting

17

was suspended to go into

18

executive session.)
