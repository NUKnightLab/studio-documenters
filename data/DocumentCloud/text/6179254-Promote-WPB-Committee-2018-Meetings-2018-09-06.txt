1. Community Grant Applications – the committee discussed 4 community grant applications

a) Silent Theatre Company’s “Wild Party Variety Hour” – RD and EC commented
that they are curious about similar applications from Silent Theatre Company for
past years

since this project focuses on a project by/for and financially benefiting just one
organization that it is not appropriate for Community Grant funding. However, it
is suggested that it be brought to Arts Committee for special consideration.
