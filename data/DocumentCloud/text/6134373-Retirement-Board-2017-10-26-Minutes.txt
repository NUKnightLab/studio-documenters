The next order of business was review and adoption of Board orders as submitted by the Board’s counsel.
In the matter of Tyler Partyka the Board finds that “Pursuant to 40 ILCS 5/5-214, and for all of the
reasons stated herein, Partyka has not established entitlement to the police pension service credit for the
period May 15, 2016, through June 11, 2017, at which time he was employed as a patrol commander for
the Village of Oak Park, Illinois, as the statutory provisions of the Act do not grant police pension credit
for such service. Partyka's request for police pension service credit for all or part of the time period
requested is, therefore, denied.”
It was moved by Trustee Wright, seconded by Trustee Brown that the Board approve the order on Tyler
Partyka, as submitted.

March 19, 2017, Tellez was disabled, but Tellez' disabling injury incurred on November 21, 2015, was not
sustained while in the performance of an act of duty; therefore, Tellez' application for a duty disability
benefit is denied. Tellez is granted an ordinary disability benefit, as more fully defined in the Pension Act,
for the time period of January 10, 2017, the date Tellez effectively exhausted her CPD medical leave time,

Board counsel reviewed with the Board members current legal matters.
The first item was review of the Tribune litigation in New York. Mr. Kugler indicated that lawsuits were
commenced in the New York courts, including the bankruptcy court, seeking to recapture monies that
investors made in the sale of Tribune stock. This Fund, as a defendant, realized approximately $500,000,
when the Tribune stock was sold. The plaintiffs have made an offer to various defendants, including the
Fund, to settle the case for approximately $75,000 of the half million dollars that the Fund received.
At the last Board meeting, the Fund decided not to accept the settlement offer, based on the status of the
case and successful defense of the case thus far. Mr. Kugler reminded the Board that the settlement offer
must be accepted or rejected by the 30th of this month. Communication was directed to the attorneys in
New York advising them of the Board's decision not to accept the offer. However, Mr. Kugler advised
that if the Board had any questions on the case, such as the risks involved, the attorneys on the case have
made themselves available for a conference call with the Board.
The Board unanimously agreed that its position hasn't changed, and will not accept the settlement offer.
The Board agreed that a conference call to further discuss the matter was not necessary.
The next item relates to a case filed by the Sergeants Association seeking to have the Fund turn over to
them, as part of a judgment they received against former Sergeant Pallohusky the monies he is receiving
from his police officer widow’s annuity benefit.
The Board filed a response in the court noting that under the Illinois Pension Statute, 5/5-218, pension
benefits are exempt from garnishment or attachment. The trial court ruled that the Fund should turn over
the money to the Sergeants Association.
The case then progressed to the appellate court. In the past thirty days, the appellate came down with a
decision finding that the statute, 5/5-218, is clear, unambiguous and provides for no attachment or
garnishment of pension credits. The trial court decision was reversed and stated that basically the
Sergeants Association could not garnish the pension benefits that Mr. Pallohusky was receiving as a result
of his police officer wife's death. So the money which has been held since March 2016, if no appeal is
filed by the next Board meeting, should be returned or sent over to Mr. Pallohusky.
Mr. Kugler next discussed a matter involving Francis Zoeller, Jr., who was convicted in the federal
courts of a felony. The US Justice Department has served the Fund with a garnishment. As part of the
order that they intend to present in federal court, the US Department of Justice will seek the Fund to turn
over to the US Government some $17,000 in this former officer’s account. He currently has over a
$100,000 in his account at the Fund. The Fund has agreed to comply with that order when issued. The US
Government has a statute which allows them to garnish from an officer’s contributions or annuity
payments. Additionally, the US Department of Justice has sent to the Fund all of the documents with
regard to the conviction, the sentencing, the hearing, and it would appear, although subject to a Board
decision, that section 5/5-227 of the Illinois Statutes would apply to his felony conviction such that he
would not be entitled to a pension benefit but entitled only to a refund of his contributions. As of this date,
the member has not presented himself to the Fund requesting a benefit or a refund.

An issue for consideration is whether the Fund should initiate the pension eligibility matter, and send a
notice to Mr. Zoller informing him that the Fund has information indicating that he has been convicted of a
felony; he has contributions in this Fund; and the Fund is going to conduct a hearing to determine
entitlement to any benefits or a refund of contributions. It is a matter for Board consideration.
The Board then held a brief session on several investment matters. Ms. Tuczak began the discussions with
a short overview of the Fund’s anticipated cash flow position at October 31, 2017. Ms. Tuczak noted that
the Fund continues to utilize the tax revenue receipts from the August collections by the City of Chicago,
to fund ongoing benefit payments. Sufficient cash on-hand is anticipated for October benefit payments
and most likely November, as well. Liquidation of assets will be necessary to fund December benefit
payments, which will be discussed at a later date.
The Fund’s Chief Investment Officer, Ms. Aoifinn Devitt, next reviewed with the Board the pending sale
of the legacy private equity portfolio. A handout on this matter was distributed to the Board members.
Ms. Devitt provided a brief overview of the legacy private equity portfolio and the reasons for
consideration of its sale on the secondary market. Ms. Devitt noted that after a request for proposal (RFP),
Evercore was selected as the broker for private discovery of the pricing of a possible sale. The portfolio
has been bundled as one product and viewed in an electronic due diligence room. All of the Fund’s
managers consented to the inclusion of their information in this electronic data room. The NAV of the
portfolio is approximately $117 million as of June 30, 2017. Eight genuine bids were received.
Ms. Devitt indicated that the next step would be to enter into a period of exclusivity with the highest
bidder, noting that the two highest bidders are currently offering 92.5 and 92.3 percent of the June 30
NAV. This period of exclusivity would allow the potential buyer to complete full due diligence necessary
to complete their offer. Ms. Devitt recommended that the Board enter into the exclusivity period, and
discussed the reasons for her recommendation to the Board on this portfolio sale.
It was moved by Trustee Brown, seconded by Trustee Caldero that the Board take the Fund’s Chief
Investment Officer's advice to move with the chosen buyer, number 1, to sell the private equity portfolio.

Ms. Devitt then provided a brief update on the Fund’s investment performance, noting the portfolio’s
performance was 1.3% for September and approximately 13.4% year-to-date in 2017. The drivers of the
strong performance were the equity markets, with the Fund’s equity portfolio increasing 2.3% for the
month of September.
Ms. Tuczak briefly discussed the Fund’s presentation at the Senate Committee Hearings on Pension
Investments, held October 16, 2017. Ms. Tuczak noted that the Fund was the first to provide testimony
and thus a lengthy question and answer discussion occurred. However, overall the Committee appeared to
be content with the Fund’s results. One item for potential action by the Board will be discussed at a
subsequent meeting.

President Hauser appointed Recording Secretary Wright to the Audit and Actuarial Committee to replace
retired Board member James Maloney. Trustee Wright accepted the appointment.
The Executive Director reported that all of the audit and actuarial reports for 2016 have been issued
and are on the Fund’s website. At this time, it would be prudent to revisit the RFPs for (1) audit and
(2) actuarial services.
The Board reviewed a summary of the RFPs submitted for (1) audit services and (2) actuarial services.
The Board had previously received full copies of all the RFPs submitted. After consideration of the
RFPs submitted, reputation and experience of the firm respondents, and estimated fees of each firm,
the Board then selected two finalists for each the (1) audit RFP and the (2) actuarial RFP. The Board
then determined that each finalist would present to the Audit and Actuarial Committee at a meeting on
November 9, 2017, at 10:30am. Each finalist would be allowed a thirty minute oral presentation. The
Audit and Actuarial Committee would review the finalist presentations and provide a recommendation
at the next Board meeting for retention of (1) an audit firm and (2) an actuarial firm.
President Hauser appointed Trustee Thomas Beyna to the Richard J. Jones Annuitants Assistance Fund to
replace James Maloney. Trustee Beyna accepted the appointment.

The Executive Director began discussion on the previously issued RFP for securities litigation firms.
In recent years, there have been inquiries from trustees about adding some firms. While these firms
work on a contingency fee basis, if they do represent the Fund in a securities litigation matter, they
quite often receive more than $25,000 in fees, Thus it was confirmed that the fairest way to add or
subtract firms from the bench of the Fund is through an RFP process. The Fund received twenty-seven
responses to the RFP which closed in June. Board counsel reviewed each response and provided a
robust summary for the Board. This summary detailed information about each firm, including firm
size, location of headquarters, Securities Class Action Service Ranking regarding settlements received
over the last year, and classification as a MWDBE and/or percentage of females or minorities. The
Executive Director discussed the current firms utilized by the Fund, along with recommendations for
action by each firm over the last few years, and success as lead plaintiff appointment by the Fund.
After lengthy discussion of the qualifications and other important characteristics of each firm, the
Board selected five firms to provide presentations to the Board at the January Board meeting. Each
firm would receive approximately 20 minutes for its presentation.
The Executive Director reviewed with the Board the following matters.
•

The first item is to welcome Trustee Lieutenant Edward Wodnicki to the Retirement Board. He
was sworn in on October 11, 2017, filling the vacancy of retired Board member James Maloney.

•

The Executive Director next discussed a matter brought to her by the Fund’s legal counsel. Board
counsel advised that the Fund should be sending a letter to all annuitants who are either, A) not
receiving free insurance from the City of Chicago, or, B) are not part of the group that retired prior
to August 23, 1989, (Korshak group) who receive insurance from the City of Chicago. The letter
would advise them and remind them of the options for healthcare coverage. And should they
elect one of the plans detailed, the Fund would deduct that premium from their pension checks. A
draft of the letter was distributed to all Board members for review. The Board had a few edits and
agreed to proceed with the mailing of the letter.

•

•

The next item discussed was correspondence from the President of the Fraternal Order of Police.
The FOP is requesting, on behalf of AETNA/LABOR FIRST to do a blind mailing to the retirees of
this Fund who do not receive insurance in scenarios (A) and (B) detailed in the prior discussion.
The Fund would provide the names and addresses to a printer, of which the FOP would not have
access to. Representatives from AETNA/LABOR FIRST would provide mailing materials, and pay
the cost of printing and mailing the information. At no time would AETNA/LABOR FIRST or the
FOP have access to the names or addresses submitted to the printer. Through general agreement,
the Board approved this request, completed as discussed.

The next item was a request from a trustee for the registration fee and travel expenses to attend the
IPPFA certified trustee program October 30 through November 2, 2017.
It was moved by Trustee Wright, seconded by Trustee Hamburger that the Board approve this expense.

Patricia Mackey, a disability recipient to whom the Fund has sent notices of scheduled
appointments with the Fund’s attending physician, has missed her first appointment. Her mail has
come back “Return to Sender” and the Fund does not have any other address on file. Another
appointment has been scheduled. If she fails to keep this appointment, there needs to be a
mechanism in place to ensure that she is informed of her scheduled annual exam and that she keeps
her appointment. The Executive Director suggested that her disability benefits be suspended at the
end of November, in the event she has not provided an updated address, so that she can be
contacted regarding her appointment with the Board’s physician. Once she provides an updated
address, her benefits would be re-instated. The Board agreed to this plan.

Board counsel queried the Trustees concerning policy and procedure concerning members with felony
conviction cases. Does the Board want to proactively contact the member or wait until the member makes
application for benefits? General agreement was to have the member’s contributions remain in the Fund
and wait until the member contacts the Fund and applies for benefits.
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR’S REPORT CONCLUDED
