3. Administrative Report
a. Open Enrollment Update
Brenda Deming, Director of Health Benefits, reported that approximately 900 members
attended the Open Enrollment Meetings that were held at four different locations throughout
Cook County. She stated that expenses for conducting the meetings were less than the
previous year. Additionally, members had positive responses to the disease management
presentations made at the Open Enrollment Meetings. Ms. Deming also stated the the
implementation of the Medicare Employer Group Waiver Plan (“EGWP”) was progessing as
planned. She added that initially an estimated 1800 members did not have correct matches
with Medicare’s data, but that number was now reduced to less than 30. If these problems are
not resolved by January 1, 2017, the member would still be covered under the Fund’s nonMedicare plan. Ms. Deming also noted that about 40 members are expected to qualify for the
low-income subsidy.
b. Trustee Education
Nickol R. Hackett, Executive Director and CIO, stated that the members of the Board were in
substantial compliance with the annual requirements for trustee education She stated that
there were seminars in December for those members who needed additional hours.
The Executive Director stated that the Harvard University Business School was conducting a
case study of public pension fund investments and their asset allocations. Harvard had
contacted the Fund and asked if its asset allocation experience could be part of the case
study. She stated that the information to be shared with Harvard was generally available to
the public. The trustees agreed that the information could be provided for the case study, but
asked the Executive Director to inquire if Harvard, in return, would waive the attendance fee
for the trustee education seminars that it might sponsor.
c. Website Demo
Courtney Hollins, Communications Manager, stated that the Fund was ready to launch its
new website. Ms. Hollins reported that all members would receive a postcard notifying them
that the new website would be available in December, but that the website address would
remain the same. While the current website had been developed to comply with legislation,
the new website was designed to be user-friendly and to educate members about their
benefits. Ms. Hollins stated that an important feature of the new website was the calculation

 tool which will allow members to obtain a rough estimate of their pension benefits so that
they can be better informed before meeting with counselors to discuss the specifics of their
annuity benefits. Ms. Hollins provided a demonstration of the website, including use of the
calculation tool. She noted that the estimator was not intended to be precise and that the
website users were informed that only benefits allowed by the Illinois Pension Code and
approved by the Board would be provided to members.
4. Legal Matters
b. In the Matter of Budlove and In the Matter of Salerno
Margaret Fahrenbach, Legal Advisor, stated that Mr. Scott Budlove and Mr. Charles Salerno
had requested administrative hearings regarding their applications for duty disability benefits.
She stated that the members were now represented by the same attorney and raised the same
issues. She asked that the matters be consolidated and that Mr. William Motto be appointed
to serve as the hearing officer. The trustees discussed that the issue of consolidation could be
allowed, but only if the hearing officer confirmed that the matters could be heard on a
consolidated basis.
It is moved by Trustee McFadden and seconded by Trustee Nevius that the Board appoint
Mr. William Motto to serve as a hearing officer for the administrative hearings requested by
Mr. Scott Budlove and Mr. Charles Salerno and that he make a recommendation about
whether the members are entitled to additional duty disability benefits pursuant to the Illinois
Pension Code. The Board further moved that the administrative hearings be consolidated,
subject to the hearing officer’s discretion.

MOTION ADOPTED UNANIMOUSLY BY VOICE VOTE

5. 2017 Finance Report
a. 2017 Budget Approval
The Executive Director presented an overview of the 2017 administrative budget for the
Fund. She stated that there had been preliminary discussions about the administrative
budget at the Board’s meeting in November. She added that the budget presentation related
to the Fund’s discretionary expenses and could be used as long-term operational planning
tool. It was noted that the Fund has a conservative operational structure, but continues to
provide services to a growing membership base. The Fund serves more members with fewer
staff members and has a smaller administrative budget than its local peers. For the current
fiscal year, the actual expenses incurred were below budget projections due to aggressive
cost management and deferred initiatives. Ms. Hackett reviewed the variances in projected
and actual expenditures for the year by category.
Trustees discussed the various budget projections. Trustee Wilson stated that it would be
helpful in assessing the budget if trustees were provided with monthly or quarterly projected
vs. actual reports so as to better understand and monitor the various categories of expenses.

 Michael Maratea, Director of Finance and Administration, stated that the Fund would
continue with its verification processes to ensure that benefits were paid only to eligible
members. The return of any Form 1099R, issued for income tax purposes, and Form 1095,
issued for health benefits verification, would trigger additional inquiry into a member’s
continued eligibility. He also noted that the 2017 budget included expenses related to the
move to new administrative offices and would not be recurring items in the following year.
The Executive Director reviewed projected initiatives for 2017 and their estimate impact.
She stated that the new website was designed to better provide information to the members
in an efficient manner. It was anticipated that the implementation of the website would
decrease the number of calls received by the Fund. She noted that a review of how disability
benefits are administered would be a major focus in 2017. Because the County will no
longer provide a County physician at 118 N. Clark Street to review applications and make the
statutorily required recommendations to the Board about a member’s disablement, the Fund
will need to engage another provider for those services and incur additional expense.
It was moved by Trustee Kouruklis and seconded by Trustee Goode, consistent with the
recommendations of the Fund’s staff, that the Fiscal Year 2017 Administrative Budget be
adopted.

could attend to satisfy their requirements for trustee education.
It was moved by Trustee Goode and seconded by Trustee Nevius, consistent with the
recommendations of the Fund staff and Fund counsel, that the expenses, including any
associated travel expenses, incurred by any Trustee or Fund staff in attending any of the
indicated educational conferences be approved, provided that the reimbursement shall be in
an for amounts that are consistent with the Fund’s Travel Expense Reimbursement Policy.
