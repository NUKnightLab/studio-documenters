IV.

Action Items
A. Contracts and Procurement Items (Attachment #2)
Gina Besenhofer, System Director of Supply Chain Management, presented the requests for the Board’s
consideration. The Board reviewed and discussed the requests.
Chairman Carvalho assumed the Chair at this time.
Dr. Ram Raju, Chief Executive Officer, provided additional information on the requests. He stated that, as
part of the activities relating to the Section 1115 Waiver, there are two components. One component is that
the System has to have people with the right skill mix on board; the second component is timeliness to bring
these people in very quickly. It is his intention that eventually the consultants will transition out, and then
the System will have its own people assuming these duties; however, since approval of the Waiver appears
imminent, the administration has to put in place very quickly what is needed. Health Management
Associates (HMA) has been working with the System, both in advising and helping with the Waiver
approval process; however, additional funds need to be put in their budget to be able to manage them and
get the patient-centered medical home model up and running.
Director O’Donnell inquired regarding the duties and responsibilities of HMA staff, and regarding the plan
for handing off some of these responsibilities to System employees. Dr. Raju stated that the Waiver
activities and approval process have taken a much longer time than expected, so a part of the funding
related to this request is to shore up the funding that has been affected by the extended process.
Additionally, he stated that although the System has a group of people who are really managing it, there is
still a need for outside expertise, because the System has never implemented a patient-centered medical
home model in the past. Dr. Raju indicated that the consultants will be the “boots on the ground” to help
staff, and will be transferring that knowledge to the medical home transformation team.

IV. Action Items
A. Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)
During the Board’s review of request number 2, Dr. Raju stated that the vendor, Susan Greene, has been
working through the HMA contract, and is well respected by staff at the State and at the Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). She is assisting with the recruitment and enrollment process as an
advisor. The System needs to have a very aggressive enrollment person in the field. This contract involves
Ms. Greene providing her services for a period of six (6) months, along with a couple members of her staff
who are experts in setting up the enrollment process and who are able to put together contracts with the
various federally-qualified health centers (FQHCs) for their services and manage a third-party administrator
(TPA). Eventually this will transition into a Cook County employee-staffed managed care department. It
will have to be a separate department because the System will have to start managing patients and care
coordination, and managing Waiver patients within the per-member per-month (PMPM) payment. It will
be the precursor to the managed care division that will report directly to Dr. Raju, and will have its own
medical director who will manage it.
Director Golden stated that she has worked with Ms. Greene in activities at the University of Chicago
Medical Center, and added that there is no doubt with regard to Ms. Greene’s credentials and competency;
however, she had concerns around the process when the System utilizes sole-source methodology in the
selection of individuals for these types of opportunities. She stated that she prefers a more open bidding
process where there is an opportunity for others who do this work, as well. She noted that she is sensitive to
the timeliness factor, however she indicated that the administration should look at opportunities for others
to participate in the bid process for these types of services. Dr. Raju agreed; he stated that his intention is to
have an open process, but noted that time is an issue and the System is looking for someone who can hit the
ground running.
Director O’Donnell, seconded by Director Muñoz, moved the approval of request
numbers 1 through 3, under the Contracts and Procurement Items. THE MOTION
CARRIED.
Director Golden voted PRESENT on request number 2.

B. Approval of Transfer of Funds requests
There were no Transfer of Funds requests for the Board to consider.

C. Proposed Amendments to the Rules of Organization and Procedure of the Board of Directors of the
Cook County Health and Hospitals System (Attachment #3)
Elizabeth Reidy, System General Counsel, provided an overview of the proposed Amendments to the Rules
of Organization and Procedure of the Board of Directors of the Cook County Health and Hospitals System.
One of the two amendments involved the ratification of a correction to one of the sections; the other
amendment relates to the Board’s ability to amend the Rules from time to time. Chairman Carvalho noted
that the proposed amendment relating to the Board’s ability to amend the Rules from time to time provides a
defined process for amendments to be presented by a Director for the Board’s consideration.

UNANIMOUSLY.

D. Approval of CCHHS FY2013 Preliminary Budget (Attachment #4)
Chairman Carvalho provided an overview of the process to date regarding the FY2013 Preliminary Budget.
The budget was presented to the Finance Committee, and the Finance Committee, having received it just the
day before, elected to defer taking a vote on it until there was an opportunity for public hearings. The public
hearings were scheduled; Finance Chairman O’Donnell chaired two public hearings at the System Board’s
regular meeting location at 1900 West Polk Street, and Chairman Carvalho chaired a public hearing held
downtown at the Cook County Building. At today’s Board of Directors Meeting, the System Board will
consider the approval of the FY2013 Preliminary Budget.
Following approval of the Preliminary Budget by the System Board, it will be submitted to the Cook County
Board, who will then consider it in whole; should the Cook County Board approve it, it will then be submitted
to Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle for inclusion in her budget recommendation that she
submits to the Cook County Board to cover all of Cook County government. President Preckwinkle’s plan
last year, and again this year, is to seek the final approval of the Cook County budget, which includes the
System’s budget, prior to the commencement of the fiscal year, which is December 1.
Under the Enabling Ordinance and the practice of the Cook County Board, the Preliminary Budget that the
System Board considers today would be considered by the Cook County Board the first time as an “all or
nothing” proposition; when it is incorporated into the President’s budget recommendation and submitted to
the Cook County Board as part of the entire Cook County budget, it would be amenable to amendment
through the normal amendment process, although the System Board would weigh in on those amendments if
and when they were proposed.
It was noted that Director Michael had submitted requests for further information regarding the Preliminary
Budget in advance of this meeting, and had received responses to his questions. Director Michael stated that
he supports the budget completely, but noted that there are a lot of assumptions, reasonable under the
circumstances, underlying the budget that have to be made. Because the System is in unchartered territory it
is not certain whether the assumptions will all be proven correct or not. One of the assumptions relates to the
ability to enroll the 115,000 Waiver patients, and the speed with which the System can do that. Another
assumption relates to the System’s ability to have the information systems and general systems in place to
keep track of the costs associated with those patients, in order for the System to be paid by Medicaid.
Director Michael indicated that the costs related to the Waiver patients have been segregated into a separate
budget, to the extent that it is possible to do so. There are a few line items, pharmaceutical services for
example, that in the total budget are completely flat; he inquired whether this type of expense may be underbudgeted to some extent, if additional supplies are needed to serve those patients. Although it has been
estimated that approximately 60% of the 115,000 patients that the System needs to enroll are already currently
being served by the System, he inquired how the assumption can be made that the other 40% of the potential
Waiver patients will not negatively impact the budget line item for pharmaceutical costs.

IV. Action Items
D. Approval of CCHHS FY2013 Preliminary Budget (continued)
Dr. Raju indicated that the System will need to go through a complete transformation. That simply means
that coordinated care needs to control the costs; this does not mean restricting access or care – it means not
duplicating or wasting services. With regard to Director Michael’s question regarding the budget for
pharmaceutical expenses, Dr. Raju stated that the medical and pharmaceutical staff is extremely adept in
managing pharmacy utilization. This is one of the well-managed departments in the System, which is one of
the reasons why the cost has remained flat.
Chairman Carvalho noted that it is important for the Board Members to go into the budget with eyes wide
open. A budget is principally a statement of priorities, but it is also a bundle of risks; the Board needs to
know what those risks are so that there is not a surprise later in the fiscal year.
Director O’Donnell noted that the Waiver is a tremendous opportunity for the System; it is an extremely
challenging task to implement. She stated that one of the reasons why it is so important to report on the
progress through the Finance Committee or at the Board Meetings is so that the administration can tell the
Board what is needed. If things are changing and something is not working, or if the administration needs to
do something a little differently, regular reporting and updates to the Finance Committee or the Board will
help to make sure that the administration is able to get the resources needed or issues resolved, in order to
reach the targets as planned.
Director O’Donnell, seconded by Director Butler, moved the approval of the CCHHS
FY2013 Preliminary Budget. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

Report from Chairman of the Board
A. Board Education
i. Overview of the Office of the Cook County Independent Inspector General and Unlawful Political
Discrimination enforcement (Attachment #5)
Patrick Blanchard, Cook County Independent Inspector General, provided an overview of information on
the Office of the Independent Inspector General (OIIG) and Unlawful Political Discrimination
enforcement. The Board reviewed and discussed the information.
ii. Standards of Conduct/Code of Ethics (Attachment #6)
Cathy Bodnar, System Chief Compliance and Privacy Officer, presented an overview of information on
the Standard of Conduct/Code of Ethics. The Board reviewed and discussed the information.
Ms. Bodnar indicated that activities are currently ongoing to review the Standards of Conduct alongside
the Cook County Ethics Ordinance, in order to update the Standards of Conduct by developing what will
be called the Cook County Code of Ethics. Chairman Carvalho inquired whether it will be clear that the
Code of Ethics applies to Board Members. Ms. Bodnar indicated that the Standards of Conduct currently
includes Board Members and will do so in the future in the Code of Ethics, as well.

Report from Chairman of the Board
A. Board Education
ii. Standards of Conduct/Code of Ethics (continued)
Ms. Bodnar stated that as staff moves closer to developing a more complete draft of the Code of Ethics,
she will work with the Audit and Compliance Committee to finalize it; following this, it will be brought
before the full Board. She noted that in addition to engaging the Board Members, employees, physicians
and union leadership will be engaged in the process.
The Board returned to the subject of the information contained in the presentation by Mr. Blanchard.
Chairman Carvalho noted that the OIIG reports involving Cook County agencies go to the Cook County
Board President, and the OIIG reports involving the System are sent to Dr. Raju, who reports to the
System Board. He asked whether this reporting structure is written into the Ordinance or whether it exists
by practice. Mr. Blanchard stated that the reporting protocol is set by Ordinance. If there is a sustained
finding involving an individual, the report goes to the President. If it involves the System, it goes to the
President and Dr. Raju. If it involves a separately elected official, it goes to the President and that
official, in addition to the human resources director of that organization to which that individual belongs.
If the finding is not sustained, the reporting mechanism is the same, although the reports are bland (for
example, complainant and subject’s names are not used). Mr. Blanchard added that has been some
discussion in the past about amending the Ordinance to have the OIIG report only to the entity in which
the case involves. Chairman Carvalho asked that consideration also be given to reports going to the
Board through some mechanism, such as the Chairman or the Audit and Compliance Committee.

LOCAL Local 73 and Doctors Council SEIU Talking Points F1
SEIU Hearings on FY 2013 Preliminary Budget 
Stronger Together September 4? 2012 Striggogher

    

 

SEIU is here to express its strong and unequivocal support for the 2013 Health System
Preliminary Budget. We must point out that this budget, for a health system already cut to the
bone, is a budget that is balanced on a knife?s edge.

We therefore loudly applaud Dr. Raju?s public commitment to no further cuts in services or
front-line jobs in 2013. We also applaud President Preckwinkle and her budget staff for
working closely with Dr. Raju to maintain the 2012 County subsidy despite the losses in
County sales tax revenue.

It is no secret that this budget is balanced on a 197 million dollar bet that will be
granted its 1115 waiver and that it will be successful in making the operational changes
required to capture this new Medicaid revenue stream.

SEIU has long recognized the significance of the 1115 waiver and, as the Board and executive
team knows, we have been a consistent and vocal champion of the waiver and has stood
ready to help move this effort whether in Cook County, Springfield or in DC.

But, politics aside, everyone, including Dr. Raju recognizes the scale of the operational
challenges we face in implementing the 1115 waiver.

Meeting these operational challenges requires us to take a massive, rigid, dysfunctional
system, forged over decades, and to collectively transform it, virtually overnight, into a nimble,
high-functioning, and, most importantly, patient?centered medical home for a complex and
high-acuity population.

While the obstacles to this transformation are numerous, the central challenge lies in the
restructuring of tasks, jobs, work processes and relationships, and, perhaps, most importantly,
the culture of our health system.

Such restructuring, in a wall-to-wall unionized setting is extremely challenging, and it requires a
robust labor-management partnership capable of channeling the knowledge and creativity of
front?line staff into system transformation.

SEIU has been working with Health System executives to operationalize a labor-management
partnership for over two years. While we received the Board?s blessing for this effort over a
year and a half ago, meaningful operational progress has in reality been painfully slow.

While our overtures to leadership have found afar more sympathetic and receptive
ear under Dr. Raju?s leadership and our efforts have thus been able to accelerate, we are still
far from where we need to be to drive successful waiver implementation.

As SEIU today pledges to support the 2013 Health System Preliminary Budget, wherever and
whenever we can, we ask the Board and executive team to re-pledge its support to our labor?
management partnership and embrace the goal of making 2013 the year we begin to rebuild
our health system, together.

PRIOR CONTRACT HISTORY:

Health Management Associates has provided with specialized technical assistance related to Medicaid
reimbursement for the past several years. The current contract provides consulting services focusing on Medicaid
cost reporting, reimbursement. policy issues and future planning regarding patient centered medical homes. HMA
has lent critical guidance in the development of the 1115 Waiver application and is utilizing their services
with the development of- and implementation of? a care coordination model that consists of the full continuum of

patient care.

NEW PROPOSAL JUSTIFICATION:

As the Cook County Health and Hospitals System approaches implementation of the Affordable Care Act
(ACA) in January of 2014, it must address organizing the delivery of care emphasizing continuity, building
relationships with other providers to assure coordination at all levels of care, establishing the infrastructure to track
and document care delivered to populations. and realigning financial incentives to promote quality and efficiency
rather than volume?in a very short time. An agreement with the federal government to establish a Medicaid 1115
Waiver that will move many of the System's patients into coverage before ACA implementation offers an enormous
opportunity to support the System transformation that is necessary to be ready for health care reform. This
amendment and increase is requested in order to secure additional critical and highly specialized expertise to assist
the System with the transformation to the patient-centered medical home model, the implementation of the 1115
Waiver, analytical and technical support for the Office of Managed Care and System Transformation. as well as other

system issues as determined by the CEO.

COOK COUNTY HEALTH AND HOSPITALS SYSTEM
REPORT TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
September 5, 2012

1115 WAIVER
Approval Process
Weekly telephone meetings with CMS, HFS, and CCHHS continue. CMS has indicated that a draft of the
terms and conditions for waiver approval will be forthcoming in the near future. CMS has not, however,
committed to a specific timeline for delivering the draft terms and conditions.

After the draft is

received, it is anticipated that discussion and negotiation of specific terms and conditions will ensue.
Additional questions continue to be asked by CMS and responded to by CCHHSS and HFS. Additional
analysis concerning the “budget neutrality” requirements of the waiver remains in progress.
Implementation Status
Internal work teams, led by Dr. Jennifer Smith, continue intensive preparations. An RFP soliciting for a
“Third Party Administrator” currently is active. Solicitations for service providers (FQHCs, Mental Health
providers, and Substance Abuse providers) to supplement the CCHHS network are being prepared.
Scope and contract terms are being negotiated with the current Medicaid eligibility vendor, Chamberlin
Edmonds, for enrollment assistance. Progress is being made on the preparation of the Hoyne Avenue,
Illinois Medical District building for occupancy by State of Illinois Department of Human Services
personnel earmarked for assisting enrollment of waiver patients.

Organizational changes to

supplement the implementation team and modify its structure are being planned and will be presented
to this Board.

 OAK FOREST HEALTH CENTER
On August 22, 2012 the groundbreaking took place for Phase 1 of the construction re development
project for the E Building on the Oak Forest Campus as part of the planned transition to the Oak Forest
Health Center. The construction will pave the way for a more effective, population health approach,
creating the opportunity for more screenings and tests with new state of the art equipment for
diagnostic imaging. The development of the Oak Forest Health Center is an integral part of the vision of
accessible primary care and more coordinated specialty care that will improve the health outcomes and
reduce unnecessary utilization of acute – and more expensive – care.
The Phase 1 development of the Oak Forest Health Center is a re affirmation of our commitment to the
Oak Forest community and to the southland. I would like to extend a sincere thank you to our current
and future partners and providers, we look forward to working with you to keep the southland healthy
and to make sure that our neighbors, the residents in this community have access to the care they need.

PUBLIC HEALTH UPDATE
Cook County Department of Public Health continues on its path toward accreditation with document
selection to demonstrate its achievement of the standards and measures of the Public Health
Accreditation Board in process.

Communicable disease activity has been high during the month of August with West Nile Virus, H3N2v
Influenza Virus, Pertussis (whooping cough) and Pontiac Fever at a suburban hotel. Active surveillance
and investigation by the Communicable Disease and Environmental Health Units is ongoing to address
these increases in communicable diseases.

West Nile Virus activity is high throughout the nation and state including suburban Cook County
(excluding City of Chicago, Evanston, Skokie, Oak Park, and Stickney Township) with 34 cases being
reported through 8.29.2012. The hot, dry weather conditions have contributed to the rise in West Nile.
While the number of cases is higher than in previous years, it does not appear that the number will
reach the number seen in 2002 (884 cases and 67 deaths). Coordination activities continue with the four
local mosquito abatement districts and communities to provide guidance on larviciding and adulticiding

 activities. The Communications and Policy Development Unit has been active with media interviews and
public service announcements emphasizing prevention messages.

RECOGNITION
Patient Thank You
We received a letter from a patient that was treated at the Cook County Department of Public Health
Integrated Clinics at the Markham Courthouse. The patient complimented the professional and caring
staff, referring to them as “Top Gun”. I would like to acknowledge and thank the staff at the Markham
Clinic, specifically: Gwendolyn Pinkney, APN, Tia Robinson May, RN, Leslie Papierski, Clinic Assistant.
Staff Acknowledgement
The Cerner PowerChart 2012 went live on July 30, 2012 and has shown terrific engagement on the part
of clinical and administrative staff throughout the health system. CCHHS is on its way to meeting federal
meaningful use requirements for electronic health records. I would like to thank Dr. Bala Hota,
CMIO/Interim CIO and his team for the successful launch of this system.
On Monday August 20, 2012 the Pharmacy Department went live with a new operating system,
EnterpriseRx. This operating system is designed to receive and process both e prescriptions and
hardcopy prescriptions. In a project of this scope and scale, some issues can occur – in fact two issues
were found: a significant connectivity issue that resulted in a delay in prescription processing time; and
our interface to the SureScripts prescribing network had some issues that prevented successful
transmission of prescriptions. As soon as these issues were raised a collaborative team led by our
Director of Pharmacy, Rhonda Yates worked toward a resolution, always keeping in mind the needs of
our patients. I am happy to report that the issues are being resolved and our patients needs are being
addressed. I want to thank Rhonda and all those that lent their assistance and expertise: Bala Hota,
Claudia Fegan, Marty Grant, Terry Mason, Carol Schneider, just to name a few, there were so many
others, thank you all.

Dead Birds: A total of 51 birds have been collected, of which 6 were positive and 1 has results pending.
Human Cases: Twenty nine human cases have been reported.
Risk Assessment
There is a high risk of human West Nile Virus infection in suburban Cook County.
Prevention: When outdoors between dusk and dawn, cover skin with lightly colored lose fitting clothing and use mosquito
repellent with DEET, picaridin or oil of lemon eucalyptus. When applying repellent, always follow the directions on the
product label. Get rid of standing water around your home in pet bowls, flower pots, old tires, baby pools and toys. Water
that is allowed to stagnate for three or four days becomes a breeding ground for mosquitoes. Make sure your doors and
windows have tightly fitting screens and repair any tears or other openings. Keep weeds and grass cut short and keep
gutters clean and free of debris.
Disclaimer: All data are preliminary and may change as more reports are received.
