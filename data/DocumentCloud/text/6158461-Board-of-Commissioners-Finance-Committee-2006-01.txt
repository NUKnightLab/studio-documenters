AMENDMENT TO THE COOK COUNTY TAXPAYERS' INTEREST
ASSURANCE ORDINANCE (PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT).
Transmitting a Communication, dated December 12, 2005 by John H. Stroger,
Jr., President, Cook County Board of Commissioners.
I am submitting for your approval an ordinance to amend the Taxpayers'
Interest Assurance Ordinance last amended on November 16, 1993. The
proposed changes are the collaboration of the Office of the Chief Financial
Officer, the Office of the County Treasurer and the County Auditor. The
proposed changes will align the County with the collateralization requirements
of other area governments, as well as enable the County to generate additional
interest income on our deposits.
The following is a synopsis of the Proposed Ordinance Amendment:
PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT
AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND THE
COOK COUNTY TAXPAYERS' INTEREST ASSURANCE ORDINANCE
LAST AMENDED ON NOVEMBER 16, 1993
WHEREAS, the County of Cook is a home rule unit of government as defined
in Article VII, Section 6(a) of the 1970 Constitution of the State of Illinois, and
as such may exercise any power and perform any function pertaining to its
government and affairs; and
WHEREAS, on March 5, 1991, the Board of Commissioners of Cook County
adopted the "Cook County Taxpayers' Interest Assurance Ordinance" directing
all elected and appointed public officials of Cook County to invest public funds
in their possession or for which they are custodians in interest-bearing
accounts; and
WHEREAS, on November 16. 1993, the Board of Commissioners of Cook
County desire to amend the "Cook County Taxpayers' Interest Assurance
Ordinance" to authorize Cook County's participation in IPTIP; and
WHEREAS, the primary objective in managing public funds is the protection of
principal; and
WHEREAS, collateralization of public funds by approved depositories through
the pledging of securities is one way to guarantee the safety of public deposits;
and
WHEREAS, the posting of collateral in excess of 102% results in a decrease in
interest earned on deposits; and

WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of Cook County desire to amend the
"Cook County Taxpayers' Interest Assurance Ordinance" to authorize Cook
County's participation in IPTIP; reduce the collateralization requirement from
110% to 102%. to define approved depositories and to establish a monitoring
procedure.
*Referred to the Committee on Finance on 12/21/05.

* The next regularly scheduled meeting is presently set for Wednesday, February 1, 2006.
