Private Management Update
Acting Director Gregory Smith updated the Board on the private management procurement
process for the Lottery. The Evaluation Committee is wrapping up its assessment of the RFP
response submitted by Camelot Illinois. The Illinois Lottery and its current private manager,
Northstar, continue to map lottery processes in anticipation of manager and supplier transitions.
Northstar will continue to provide all management services until a new private manager is in
place.
Responsible Gaming
Ms. Tomao then gave a summary of Responsible Gaming practices. She stated that the Illinois
Lottery was a member of the World Lottery Association, which created a Responsible Gaming
framework so that each aspect of gaming is considered in a lottery’s quest to operate responsibly.
Using this framework, the Illinois Lottery put in place a plan to address each of these 10 areas
and to assure across-the-board compliance at every level of the organization.
The mission of the Illinois Alliance is to assure wide-scale public awareness of problem
gambling. The state’s gaming industry joined with treatment providers to promote education,
increase access and full coordination of the resources and information available to assist problem
gamblers, those who are at risk, and those who are affected. Every Alliance member, including
the Lottery, has a link to the Alliance on their websites.

*Responsible Gaming messages included on all communications throughout the year
