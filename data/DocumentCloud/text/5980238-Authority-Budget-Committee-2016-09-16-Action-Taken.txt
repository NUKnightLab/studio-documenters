Since this memorandum is the official notification of Budget Committee action taken on
September 16, 2016, the following is a reminder to the members of the Authority’s
organizational rules regarding committee oversight. Section 1750.340(I) of the
Authority’s Organizational Rules states:
i)

Oversight of Committees—In order to provide for oversight by the
Authority of actions taken by any committee, whether ad hoc or standing,
Authority members shall be notified—by phone, mail or equivalent—of
all motions passed by a particular committee, within five (5) business days
of any committee meeting, or prior to the next meeting of that committee,
or before the next meeting of the Authority, whichever is sooner. Within
ten (10) business days of receipt of such information, a special meeting of
the Authority may be convened upon the request of five (5) Authority
members, for the purpose of fully discussing any action taken by a
committee and to supersede the authorization granted to the committee to
act on the Authority’s behalf in any particular matter.

Subject to the oversight process described above, the Budget Committee action becomes
the action of the Authority.
