 EXPLANATION
To ensure continued compliance with CHA’s Housing Choice Voucher (“HCV”) Administrative
Plan and 24 CFR 982.553 (Denial of admission and termination of assistance for criminals and
alcohol abusers) HCV Program screens adult household members for certain types of criminal
activity before admission to the program, at a move, for adult additions to the household, or head
of household changes. Consequently, it is necessary to contract with a screening company to
conduct the criminal background checks. The background check is then provided to CHA,
which is used as assistance for a final determination.
On February 17, 2009, the Board authorized the CHA to enter into a contract for tenant screening
services for public housing residents with Screening Reports, Inc. This vendor was chosen due
to the fact that Screening Reports, Inc. offered the most robust services at competitive pricing,
including (1) most comprehensive screening packet for the per person cost (multi-county
criminal and eviction services as well as national criminal search, and multi-state sex offender
searches), (2) ongoing post-occupancy crime alerts of individuals, (3) National social security
trace and verification, and (4) customized scoring models to assist in objective readings of
reports.
On March 16, 2010, the Board authorized the CHA to amend the contract with Screening
Reports, Inc so that the HCV Program could take advantage of the Contract and to increase the
Contract’s not-to-exceed amount. Subsequently, the HCV Program’s special Improving
Properties Initiative (“IPI”) (and data matching agreement with CPD), resulted in the HCV
Program running background checks for all HCV households admitted prior to FY2010. In
addition, the modified HCV FY2010 Administrative Plan states, “HCVP will run a criminal
background check on each adult family member 18 years and older, including Live-In-Aides at
admission, annual reexaminations, at interim reexaminations, and moves”. Because of this
increased volume of screening reports, the HCV Program is requesting authorization to add
$160,000 to the Contract’s not-to-exceed amount to cover the costs of running these additional
criminal background checks. Additionally, Screening Reports, Inc. has agreed to provide the
CHA with segregated billing for this special initiative at a reduced cost of $5 per screening. The
HCV Program and special IPI background screenings, and anticipated costs for the anticipated
screenings for all tenant based voucher family adults 18 years and older, including, live-in-aides
are included in this request for a funding increase.
Based on the foregoing, it is in the best interest of the CHA to authorize the Chief Executive
Officer or his designee to amend the Contract Number 9009 with Screening Reports Inc. to
provide tenant services screening services to the HCV Program and increase the Contract by an
amount not to exceed $160,000.00. The contract’s new aggregate not-to-exceed funding amount
will be $542,000.00.
