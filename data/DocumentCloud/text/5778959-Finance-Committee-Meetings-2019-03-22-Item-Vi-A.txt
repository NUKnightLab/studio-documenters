Provides millions $/year of medications/care through funded research
• Expensive or investigational medications to treat HIV and cancer

•

Informed, inquisitive clinician-investigators improve patient care, lifts
morale

•

CCH well represented in the medical literature and scientific gatherings

•

Influence public health practice and policy through partnerships with
public agencies: IDPH, CDPH, CCDPH, CDC, and NIH

 CCH Institutional Review Board Mission
• Primary: Protection of human research subjects from harm and
assurance of fully informed voluntary participation…

 Project 1: Opioid Prescribing Social Network, CountyCare
Implications and Response
• Highly interconnected prescribers in the network’s core were clinicians of CCH’s chronic pain
management center. Their model of chronic pain management may be part of a national
solution.

• Prescribers in the network’s periphery and specialties like emergency medicine and procedural
specialties were vulnerable to exposing patients to high daily dose opioids through discoordinated
prescriptions.
• Cook County Department of Public Health targeted public health detailing toward
prescribers among procedural specialists.
• Illinois legislation (SB 1607) mandating prescribers to use the Prescription Monitoring Program for
first time opioid prescriptions to each patients went into effect January 2018. Evaluation of its
impact on CountyCare members planned.

CRU Ongoing Role in CCH Initiatives Around Housing Insecurity
• In support and coordination with executive leadership and external partners to make contact
with patients prioritized for permanent supportive housing through the FHP.
• Lead and execute outcomes evaluation of CCH patients in the FHP.

• Synthesize experience from CCH’s recent participation in other housing programs into
generalizable knowledge (WIN II, Illinois Housing Development Authority rental subsidy
program).
• Participate in discussions about new CCH initiatives related to housing and involve Integrated
Care Management, Departments of Emergency Medicine and Psychiatry, and others.
