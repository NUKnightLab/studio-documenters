During the discussion of slide 6 of the metrics, Director Driscoll requested that the actual numbers of
hospital acquired infections be provided in a table format.
With regard to slide 9 of the metrics, Dr. Wyatt noted that there were less than seven (7) surveys
submitted by patients, so staff could not validate the numbers. Director Richardson-Lowry suggested that
an analysis be done comparing the number of patients surveyed versus the number of surveys returned, to
try to determine the reason for the low response rate.
