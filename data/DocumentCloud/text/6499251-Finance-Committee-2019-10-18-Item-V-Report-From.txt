Observations on Financials
 Net Patient Service Revenues - $506M, 6% unfavorable to target due to increasing and unsustainable growth in
charity care, some lower clinical activity and lower revenue cycle activity
•

System-wide uninsured numbers
•

Captured by Visits, held at 44%

•

Captured by Charges, held at 40%

 CountyCare Capitation Revenues - $1.3B, 5% unfavorable to target due to lower than budgeted enrollment as a
result of lower State/County MCO enrollment
 Other Revenues - $13M , trending to exceed FY2019 target

 Cost of Pharma - $63M, unfavorable by 3% compared to budget and closely monitored/managed to get to target
