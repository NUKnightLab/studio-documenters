Recommendations, Discussion / Information Item
A.

Strategic planning discussion (Attachment #2)
Topic: Human Resources, presented by Gladys Lopez

Dr. John Jay Shannon, Chief Executive Officer, stated that Ms. Lopez will be reviewing a strategic planning
presentation on Human Resources. Additionally, he introduced Richard Sewell, Associate Dean of Community
and Public Health Practice at UIC School of Public Health, who will be facilitating the strategic planning
discussions in these meetings through to the adoption of a full strategic plan in the summer.
Ms. Lopez provided an overview of the presentation, which included information on the following subjects:
• Human Resources Department functions;
• Demographics of employees (various data)
Employee Population by Age and Years of Service
Employee Population by Race and Ethnicity
Employee Population by Gender
Employee Population by Union vs. Non-Union
Employee Population – Clinical and Non-Clinical Positions
Employee Population – Comparison of Management and Staff Positions
• Union Membership Rates by State, 2015 Annual Avg.
• CCHHS Management Functions
• Human Resources Tactics to address Principle Objectives
During the discussion of the subject of educational requirements for certain positions and further educational
opportunities for employees, Director Velasquez suggested that the administration consider partnering with
Malcolm X College to look at continuing education initiatives. Director Junge agreed; she noted that the subject
has been mentioned in the past, and should be further considered.
With regard to the subject of cultural competency, Chairman Wiese noted that studies in education have shown that
the racial and ethnic makeup of staff and faculty make a big difference in the culture and climate of the institution.
Additionally, there are many studies that have been done to determine why health is not improving for American
Indians. The reason why is because they do not trust western medicine; however, if American Indians were to see
other American Indians working at that institution, that begins to build trust.
Director Velasquez referenced the conversation held the previous day at the Audit and Compliance Committee
Meeting; there was an energetic dialogue on several subjects, including those relating to employee productivity,
resources, and community health workers. She noted that another benefit of using community health workers is
that those workers will connect to patients in those communities with a level of trust that can be challenging to
establish under different mechanisms.

VI.

Adjourn
Chairman Wiese, seconded by Director Gugenheim, moved to adjourn. THE MOTION
CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY AND THE MEETING ADJOURNED.

Consider type of work, level of staff, and other
factors when determining the ideal employee to
manager ratio as it can be varied by skill
set/experience:
•
•
•

4 to 1 direct reports to Vice-President /
Senior Manager
20 to 1 direct reports in an
Administrative Area
Average is 10 to 1

Staff with greater experience would like
require less managing:
•
•

i.e. IT 20 to 1 for programmers
i.e. Call Center (low-level tasks) 15

Less involvement required from the Manager
would result in a larger staff ratio

“The people we hire, and the focus we put on their development as leaders, are critical to
P&G ’s ability to innovate and compete. Nothing I do will have a more enduring impact on P&G’s long-term success
than helping to develop other leaders.”
- A.G. Lafley, CEO, Proctor & Gamble

"It is not the strongest of the species that survive, nor the most intelligent, but
the one most responsive to change." –Charles Darwin

decades.”

“In our values and our commitments - as physicians, our primary raison d’être is patient care. The welfare of patients, the

education of students and residents, and the growth of research knowledge - these are important commitments underlying our
profession.”
Waldhousen JMD. Leadership in Medicine Gibbon John H., Jr LectureHershey, PA: 2000

Five fundamental leadership principles are critical to building a better future:
1. Recognizing that the work of leadership involves an inward journey of self-discovery and selfdevelopment;
2. Establishing clarity around a set of core values that guide the organization as it pursues its goals;
3. Communicating a clear sense of purpose and vision that inspires widespread commitment to a shared
sense of destiny;
4. Building a culture of excellence and accountability throughout the entire organization; and
5. Creating a culture that emphasizes the development of leaders and leadership as an organizational
capacity.
Leadership and learning are inextricably linked.
