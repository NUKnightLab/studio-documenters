Funding Source: General Fund – Jail Medical
Tanisha Gates and Stephen Witt, Sheriff’s Department, presented. Lenora Lockett commented that the
vendor has not completed the registration process with the Office of the Inspector General and asked if
the vendor could be registered under a different name or if this service would qualify as physician services
and be exempt from registration. Mr. Witt stated that the vendor is currently registered under the name
of Kurt Zillmann.
Trevor McAleer asked if Alternative Body Connections, LLC is the current provider and how many inmates,
on average, are receiving therapy; asked if services are being provided at the downtown Jail and who
issues the orders for therapy services; and asked if there is a current contract in place and if so, when will
it expire.
Ms. Gates indicated there is no current contract.
Mr. McAleer asked how this vendor has been providing services with no contract and whether services
were ever bid out; asked if this vendor was ever selected through a competitive bid process and requested
additional information on how this vendor was selected prior to this contract; asked for a total paid to
this vendor to date; and asked if there is a termination clause in this contract in case MetroHealth can
begin providing these services prior to this contract’s expiration.
Dennis Kennedy asked if services were being paid on office vouchers in the past and asked for
confirmation that those amounts billed were generally less than $1,000; asked if the amount of this
contract will be for new services only and not for services already provided; and asked if the last office
voucher paid would have occurred within the past 30 days.
Nan Baker asked if services will be added to the new contract that is being negotiated with MetroHealth
and if the new contract is expected to be finalized before the end of the year; asked why will it take 6
months to negotiate this service with MetroHealth, where this contract would not otherwise be
necessary; and asked for clarification on whether the past practice of paying by invoice was an option.
Mr. Kennedy indicated that paying by invoice is not an option because funds must be encumbered for
tracking allocations and for audit purposes.
Mr. McAleer addressed Ms. Baker’s question as to whether this service would be part of the MetroHealth
contract and stated that he does not recall a line item for physical therapy services in the contract so this
may result in an additional expense outside of the contract.
Mr. Kennedy stated that additional information regarding this request will be distributed to the Board
members.
Dennis Kennedy motioned to approve the item; Trevor McAleer seconded. Item BC2019-484 was
unanimously approved.

 C. – Consent Agenda
Trevor McAleer referred to Item BC2019-485 and asked what the average life span of a crane is and how
much did the County pay for the equipment. Dennis Kennedy asked what the current value of the crane
is. Dale Miller asked if the department could have anticipated, prior to the purchase, that the crane usage
would not last beyond 3 years, after it no longer fit with the department’s strategy.
Nan Baker referred to Item BC2019-486 and asked for clarification on the subgrant agreement end date;
asked why the payment was not made earlier and how much money has been held that is to be paid;
asked if there is any need to extend the time period of the agreement; and asked for clarification on the
amount owed. Dennis Kennedy asked what the dates of the invoices are and why did it take one year to
bring this request forward to get the invoices paid.
Trevor McAleer referred to Item BC2019-489 – Direct Open Market Purchases on various requisitions for
food purchases for the Sheriff’s Department and stated that the proposals for food service are currently
being scored for a new contract and that this may perhaps, be the last food order utilizing this process for
the Jail, which is a positive step in the management of the Jail.
There were no further questions on the consent agenda items. Dennis Kennedy motioned to approve
items BC2019-485 through -489; Michael Dever seconded, the consent agenda items were unanimously
approved.
