RQ#41251
RSM US LLP Contract Amendment
Scope of Work Summary
The Department of Information Technology is requesting approval of a contract amendment with RSM US
LLP for additional funding under the existing Statement of Work for Organizational Readiness Assessment
to the RSM Third-Party Assurances contract for the anticipated cost not-to-exceed $50,000.00.
Authority for this Request: Additional funding is being requested under the contract provision B5 17 (Page
7) which reads “RSM will assist in identification of realistic recommendations (templates, policies,
procedures) to close or remediate findings. The TPA estimate includes hours for recommendations.
However, if substantial RMS support or effort is consumed then the Project Manager will document and
communicate potential need for a change order may be necessary.”
Background: RSM, under their current contract provide the Cuyahoga County ERP Program with Third
Party Consulting services for Organizational Readiness Assessment, Testing Readiness Assessment, and
Deployment Readiness Assessment. The SOW for this work specifically calls for RSM to “assist in the
identification of realistic recommendations (templates, policies, procedures) to close or remediate
findings.”
In the June 2019 ERP Executive Steering Committee meeting RSM presented their Organizational
Readiness and communication status observations; it was noted at that time that there had been little
work done in this area for Fiscal go-lives therefore a formal evaluation could not conducted at that time.
On the strong recommendation by Jack Rhyne, the decision was made with Matt Carroll (then Interim
Chief of Staff), to ask RSM to provide detailed recommendations along with work and planning templates
for the county to use in identifying stakeholder groups and creating communications plans. This work was
and is clearly within the scope of RSM’s existing current contract Statement of Work and there were, and
are, funds available in the current contract to perform the work. The Law department has reviewed the
Statement of Work and concurs.
The county required this assistance in this area because it currently does not have the expertise in county
staff. RSM has the expertise and specifically a consultant that has already been working with the county
in performing the readiness assessments for Organizational Readiness for some time.
The assistance that RSM has provided has been very effective. An October 24th ,2019 assessment the
status has move from the June finding of 0% ready to 65% ready for communications with several areas
still improving weekly as the plan that RSM help the county create is being executed.

24

 Request: Because of the additional assistance required of RSM in the area of Operational Readiness
Assessment thus far for Fiscal it estimates that it will require an additional $50k to perform the remaining
assessments and recommendations to senior management for Payroll, Work Force Management,
Accounts Payable and Procurement. The current contract calls
Decision: The county could elect not to do these assessments however these are high risk areas of the
implementation and having a 3rd party (RSM) assess our readiness reduces the risk by identifying areas
of concern to be addressed before go-live is executed.
Recommendation: Provide the additional $50K of funding proposed by RSM to ensure that all remaining
assessment work can completed by RSM in support of the higher risk go-lives scheduled between now
and April 2020.
Additional funds of $50,000 and the extension of the contract to June 30, 2020 is requested.
Technology Items
If the request is for the purchase of software or technical equipment:
a) Please state the date of TAC Approval n/a
b) Are the purchases compatible with the new ERP system? Services are for the implementation of the

 B. – New Items for Review
BC2019-859
Dpw, 2019 Olmsted Township sewer connection resident reimbursements, $10,500
Scope of Work Summary:
Department of Public Works is requesting reimbursement of up to $1,500 per resident for sanitary sewer
construction costs for a group of seven (7) Olmsted Township residents related to the Bagley Road Sewer
Project.
There is currently an MCIP Grant Reimbursement program in place with the Northeast Ohio Regional
Sewer District (NEORSD) for individual resident sewer connection reimbursements of $1,500 for up to 85
residents which is effective from January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2020. (CON2018-125 passed on
December 10, 2018).
This group of seven residents in the Bagley Road project area made their sewer connections BEFORE the
effective date of the grant program and are therefore not eligible for the reimbursement from NEORSD.
To be consistent for all affected by the project, the County looks to reimburse these residents at the same
rate as their neighbors who connected after January 1, 2019.
The primary goal is for the County to reimburse up to seven residents (they must first make the sewer
connection and then submit paperwork to the County before the reimbursement can take place).
The reimbursement of $1,500 per resident would total $10,500 if all seven residents applied and
submitted paperwork and these reimbursements would ultimately come out of the Olmsted Township
sewer district fund.
The location of the project is Olmsted Township.
The project is in Council District 5.

SURVEILLANCE CAMERA INSTALLATION FOR PATH FROM CORRECTIONS CENTER TO COURT TOWER AND
BULLPEN
Scope of Work Summary
Department of Information Technology on behalf of the Sheriff’s Office requesting approval of a RFP
Exemption for purchase and installation with Integrated Precisions Systems, Inc in the amount of
$62,853.30.
The County operates an Enterprise, Networked Physical Security System throughout the County. There
are over 200 existing cameras in Jails 1 and 2. Upon review of the issues presented by various assessments
of the facilities and a review with current Corrections’ Management, products and recommendations
were determined. The purchase of these cameras will assist staff in monitoring those inmates who are
scheduled to attend Court proceedings. This path and holding area are not covered by recording cameras
currently. This procurement and installation will allow for better monitoring of inmates and staff as
prisoners are escorted to the Court Tower.
The equipment being purchased is expanding the currently installed system that IPS is under contract to
maintain. Any additions to the current system will have to involve our current vendor (IPS) due to the
architecture and infrastructure that has been built out. Introducing other vendors and equipment is not
cost effective or functionally appropriate. Should other vendors start supplying “pieces parts” to this
system, the County runs the risk of having multiple points of failure and complicates the management and
troubleshooting of the system. Doing so would compromise the integrity of the systems and create
confusion in the management and support of the systems. When the County required Whiting-Turner to
bid the security equipment for the new Maintenance Yard, months of additional time was added to the
project completion time line. In addition, tens of thousands of dollars was added to the cost of the project
for contractors and subcontractors. Further delays in the scope of work may place the health and safety
of inmates and/or staff at risk.
The costs provided are under IPS’s state term schedule pricing. The pricing for this equipment has been
vetted and reviewed by the State of Ohio’s Department of Administrative Services. In addition, some of
the pricing provided by IPS is below STS pricing. In the last six months, an RFQ and Bid were released for
work in County facilities. Only one vendor came back as qualified and responsive.
Procurement
The procurement method for this project was RFP Exemption – State Contract.
The total value of the RFP Exemption is $62,853.30.
Integrated Precision Systems, Inc. (IPS) is able to provide the needed Access Control and Security Camera
and Storage solutions under Ohio STS #800545 which expires on January 31, 2021. The costs provided are
under IPS’s state term schedule pricing. The pricing for this equipment has been vetted and reviewed by
the State of Ohio’s Department of Administrative Services. In addition, some of the pricing provided by
IPS is below STS pricing.

Scope of Work Summary
Dept of Information Technology is requesting approval of a contract with WOWZA Media Systems, LLC for
the anticipated cost of $10,000.
This state-of-the-art streaming media Content Delivery Network CDN will increase access to Government
meetings over mobile devices. The CDN also transcodes the source signal to create streams that are
optimized for the device it is being viewed on. This allows an iPhone / Android user to get a lower bitrate
video than a desktop or TV viewer. This move to a cloud-based solution will allow us to have more reliable
video streams that are capable of handling larger audiences than a media server in a county-based data
center. The anticipated start-completion dates are (10/15/2019-- 10/15/2020).
The primary goals of the project are to enhance the live video stream capabilities of Cuyahoga County.
The Cloud based Content Delivery Network (CDN) offers numerous end user experience improvements,
security upgrades, overall reliability improvements and enhancements to our current workflows. This also
allows us to standardize our Council Chambers, Committee Room A, Committee Room B and the 8th floor

Project Status and Planning
The project is new to the County in this expanded capacity. The County has used WOWZA services in a
limited fashion in the past two years. We are now expanding the use to provide a standardized approach
to all video streaming spaces in the Administration building.
The project is on a critical action path because, the Cloud based CDN will link directly with video encoder
hardware that is scheduled (October 2019) to be installed in the Administration Building 6th floor
Broadcast studio, it will also be connected to the Crestron control systems within the Council and Boards
meeting spaces. It is vital that the WOWZA CDN be in place for the AV integrator to complete the hardware
and software installation, testing and configuration in a timely manner. The goal is to not have an
interruption in Council video stream delivery.

fiscal reviews and client outcomes. It is anticipated that 225 offenders will be served each year, estimated
at 50% females and 50% males.
The reason this item is being submitted well after the contract start date of July 1, 2019 includes the
following issues influencing the submission date.
1. The State of Ohio did not pass the current two (2) year budget until July 15, 2019.
2. The Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction received confirmation as to their community
corrections funding availability on July 17, 2019.
3. Although the contract would have already be at least three (3) weeks late if the Corrections Planning
Board had the ability to move it forward at that time, we were unable to do so because of the required
appropriations underpinning the contract required approval prior to this happening.
4. In August, there was only one (1) fiscal agenda (August 6th) Corrections Planning Board potentially
could have placed the appropriations item on. The August 6th meeting was not on the original schedule
released by OBM to include appropriations. By the time the Court learned that appropriations were
to be included in the August 6th meeting, the deadline to submit required documents had passed (July
25th).
5. Upon review of required OnBase documentation that accompanies all contracts, the Corrections
Planning Board discovered that during this lapse in time, the Vendor-provided certificates for
insurance had expired. The Vendor was contacted and provided an updated certificate on 09/06/19.
6. The next scheduled meeting with appropriations on the agenda did not take place until September
10th with funding becoming available September 11th.

Department of Information Technology
Justification for Alternative Procurement
Software/System:
Bulk Email Marketing Solution
Identified Issue:
The Web team identified an issue where emails were being significantly delayed
when being sent to a large volume of email addresses, both internal and external. As this solution is
needed across agencies (Web/Multi-Media/Communications/HHS/Municipalities) it made sense for
everyone to collaborate, gather the departments’ requirements and search for a solution that works best
for everyone.
We researched Bulk Email Marketing solutions and found that there were many that may meet or exceed
our needs. We issued a Formal RFP (#46738) that was sent to more than 10 of the top-ranked vendors for
competitive bidding. One of the popular vendors, MailChimp, does not respond to RFPs, so unfortunately,
they could not be part of the process. There were only 3 proposals, one of which was non-compliant as
per OPD guidelines. The team proceeded with evaluating the 2 that were compliant. While one was
superior to the other, it was very expensive and would not be a justifiable use of taxpayers’ money. The
second proposal did not have government clients, as requested in the RFP.
We explored other options for procurement such as State Term Contracts, GSA, Cooperative Purchasing
Agreements without success.
There are several email marketing systems that may meet our needs with reasonable pricing options.
Therefore, we would like to explore a non-standard procurement approach to potentially find a solution
that best fits our needs in terms of features, installed base, and cost.
Approach:
• Reach out directly to vendors of this solution
• Evaluate each individually via demonstrations
• Obtain other government reference checks
• Collectively select a vendor
• Process this transaction

2020 Cjfs Amend Resolution For Skill-Up / Alternative Procurement Procedure
AMENDING FOR TIME ONLY to extend the end date to 12/31/2021. NO SCOPE CHANGE.
PREVIOUS CHANGE:
BC2019-148 previous amendment
PREVIOUS AMENDMENT LANGUAGE
BC2016-892 / BC2017-804 Amended Procedure Request
Department of Development
Businesses either located in Cuyahoga County, or located elsewhere but employing Cuyahoga County
residents, may submit applications for reimbursement of employee training costs to the Department of
Development. A separate application will be submitted for each employer participating in Skill-Up.
Department of Development staff will review each application and work with the business submitting the
application as needed to be sure the proposed training plan and training wage differential are consistent
with Cuyahoga County’s Learn and Earn program. Upon approval of each application, the Skill-Up
Department Orders are being processed by JFS Procurement. Generally, the business has begun the
training program for the employee; however, the County reimbursement will not take effect until
approval is granted. As the business pays out its approved training costs and training wage differential, it
may submit up to 4 invoices to the Department of Development with backup documentation as required
by Learn and Earn program guidelines. Department of Development staff will review each invoice and,
upon approval, submit the approved invoice for payment under the appropriate Department Order. The
total amount reimbursed for training of each employee will not exceed the amount of the Department
Order authorizing their training and training wage differential.
Because companies will be ready to request training approval on a rolling basis throughout the calendar
year, it is necessary to have a flexible approval process that complies with all legal requirements while
giving businesses certainty as to when their employee training applications will be approved.
The Law Department previously advised Development that an alternate process involving execution of a
single master contract, with repeated amendments to the contract adding new businesses, is under
development but we are not yet considering that option.
Companies will apply on a rolling basis and Department Order(s) will be issued for each company. There
may be various requests for Department Orders issued for the same vendor for the same training time
period, so the department can maintain the payment process. Each Department Order will be submitted
for approval on the regular weekly Board of Control calendar.

FCSS is a funding stream Family and Children receives every year under ORC121.37. The signature for the
Allocation Letter was approved on DOC#45643949 on July 9, 2019, CON2019-61. FCSS funds provide a
flexible funding stream for families seeking services community based wraparound assistance. Families
can select local and accessible providers, which are often used one time. FCSS funds must be flexible for
the following reasons:
-These state and federal dollars support non-Medicaid billable services.
45

 -FCSS focuses on maintaining children and youth in their own homes/communities by providing nonclinical family-centered services and supports. FCSS is built on the foundation that family involvement in
service planning and implementation:
a: is critical to successful treatment outcomes
b. strengthens the existing capacity of families to improve family functioning
c. ensures safety and well-being of each family member
-The target population for FCSS is children birth to 21, with multi-systemic needs, who are receiving
service coordination through the local FCFC partners.
-Single agencies or programs providing service coordination(outside of the Service Coordination
Mechanism) that may not be able to meet the needs of youth/families can make a referral to FCFC Service
Coordination for cross-system team planning.
-If these families meet the local criteria for FCFC Service Coordination and a FCFC Individual Service
Coordination Plan(IFCSP) is developed, that families identifies as FCSS eligible and then FCSS funds may
be used for the purpose(s) identified in the IFSCP.
-In order to prevent duplication of plans or conflicting expectations of the family, the agency/program
plan should be integrated into or linked to the coordinated plan with the FCFC IFSCP.
Service Coordination is mandated in ORC121.37. The Ohio Family and Children First Council created this
funding stream in conjunction with the Ohio Department of Mental Health & Addition
Services(OHIOMHAS) to offer flexible wraparound services to families at the local level and reduce the
number of children/youth in congregate care. The state guidance requires FCFC to maintain a copy of the
IFSCP with the application.
The total amount of the application is $407,897.00. for the time period of 7/1/2019 to 6/30/2020. FCFC is
requesting to pay for services for the families to various vendors from other agencies in which families
are involved with such as Bright Beginnings, Division of Children and Family Services, Juvenile Court, Board
of Developmental Disabilities, and mental health providers via ADAMHS Board of Cuyahoga County.
FCFC is requesting that individual payments to vendors be processed by submitting a request into
BuySpeed, then an issuance of Department Order for any amount up to $24,999.00 that does not require
any additional BOC approval. Currently, FCFC adheres to the OPD policy of processing all payments
through BuySpeed for BOC approval. The vendors most families choose have been used repeatedly by the
families because of the specialized services the vendors provide. The length of time for vendors to receive
payments can take up to three months long before payment is received. The delay in payment can delay
the start of service for the youth and families. This delay can cause undue stress to the families and
vendors may not be willing to agree to payment from the County. An estimate of 300 invoices were
processed this year. FCFC will provide all back up documentation for the requisitions for review and
approval by the Office of Procurement and Diversity, including a running tally(spreadsheet) of

46

 expenditures, a current State of Ohio Auditor's Findings for Recovery and verification that vendors are not
on any debarment list from Cuyahoga County, the State of Ohio, and/or the United States of America, as
well as any other required documents from the OPD checklist.
**The Alternative Procurement was approved in SFY19 BC2018-933. **
**The funding is a combination of federal child welfare dollars 75% and state general revenue funds
25%.
***The operational capacity grant is also included in this item for $15,750.00. It is to be included in our
budget as it apart of the allocation from the state for reimbursement for staffing.***
