GENERAL BACKGROUND

0 ma] Acguisition
On June 21, 2011, the Board of Commissioners authorized the Chicago Housing Authority

(CHA) to acquire 515 West Oak Street, Chicago, Illinois as part of ongoing redevelopment and
revitalization efforts on and around the former Cabrini-Green public housing sites. The 0.225-
acre site includes an abandoned and deteriorating church building that has sat vacant for
approximately ten years. The site lies directly to the north of the Cabrini Row Houses.

At the time of acquisition, the appraiser attached a value to the land underlying the
church at $840,000.00, and reduced the property?s value by his estimated demolition cost of
$125,000.00, leaving a net value of $715,000.00. The CHA further negotiated the actual
purchase price down to $604,175.00 to ensure that the CHA recouped the entire cost of the
intended demolition of the building. The total cost to the CHA of the acquisition plus demolition
is $824,710.00, $15,290 less than the land?s appraised value 

Demolition Process

Deteriorating brickwork presents a hazard, necessitating the installation of a canopy around
portions of the building to protect the public. The seller committed to bearing the cost of the
canOpy through May 31, 2012. Given its condition and the desire to clear the site for future
redevelopment, CHA staff immediately began the process of demolition upon acquisition of the
structure, including design work and demolition contractor solicitations. The CHA has worked
with the City?s Building Department to work out a schedule for demolition. Demolition must
commence by May 31, 2012 or the City?s Building Department could start to assess ?nes. The
CHA also negotiated with seller to install canopies around the building through May 31, 2012 at
the seller?s expense.

The Chicago Housing Authority advertised Invitation for Bid No. 11 - 00861 (the
for demolition services to raze the building in December of 2011. The demolition process
will include, but not be limited to, the following: mobilizing equipment, securing site
fencing, coordinating street and/or sidewalk closures, providing security, securing
permits, approvals, and authorizations, performing abatement and disposing of all hazardous
materials, removing all trash and debris, providing site extermination, performing
utility terminations, performing structural demolition, ?lling, grading and restoring the
site, and (1) hydro seeding for new grass. The demolition process will have a duration of no
more than 90 days.

PROCUREMENT HISTORY
The CHA advertised the IF on December 14, 2011. The IF was advertised in the Chicago
Sun-Times, the Chicago Defender, El Dia, on the CHA website and on BuySpeed Online. The
Pre-Bid meeting and Site Visit were held on December 19, 2011. One (1) addendum was issued

After performing an initial review of the bid submittal materials to determine if they were
complete, the Department of Procurement and Contacts (?Procurement?) and the Capital
Construction Department held a pre-award survey/clari?cation meeting with the
apparent low bidder, N.F. Demolition, Inc. (N .F . Demolition). A Compliance Specialist reviewed
the ?nn?s compliance materials in detail. N.F. Demolition?s MBE Participation is 32.9% and
they will hire one (1) Security Guard to meet their Section 3 requirements. The representatives of
N.F. Demolition responded to questions on the thoroughness of their bid, how they developed
their Division Costs, the amount of work they planned to self-perform, and the methods they
would use to ensure the safety of the community during the demolition activities.

The past experience with N.F. Demolition includes satisfactory completion of multiple
CHA demolition projects. They have been awarded $3,475,888.00 in demolition work through
competitive solicitations since 2004. Their ?nancial status has been reviewed and deemed
acceptable based on an analysis of their Dun Bradstreet report and ?nancial statements. N.F.
Demolition has no liens, judgments or bankruptcies in its ?nancial record.

Having completed its review of the bid materials of the apparent low bidder, the staff of the CCD
recommends that N.F. Demolition be awarded a contract for this demolition work. Procurement
has completed its own review of the bid materials and recommendation and has
determined that N.F. Demolition is the lowest responsive and responsible bidder at $220,535.00.

Based on the foregoing, the CCD recommends that the Board of Commissioners authorize the
Chief Executive Of?cer or his designee to enter into a contract with N.F. Demolition, Inc. in the
amount of $220,535.00 for the demolition of 515 W. Oak Street in Chicago, IL. Work is to be
completed by no later than ninety (90) calendar days from the date set forth in the Notice to
Proceed.

This award is subject to the Contractor?s compliance with the Section
