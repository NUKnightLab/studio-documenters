·7· ·evening, everyone.· My name again, as you just

10· · · · · · ·I'm here because I have a complaint about
11· ·a detective who was assigned to my case who I kept
12· ·calling and he never came, called me back.· Never,
13· ·not one time when I called for him, they would just
14· ·leave me hanging.
15· · · · · · · The purpose of me calling was we have a
16· ·site called Next Door Douglas where all the
17· ·communities come together and we talk about our
18· ·neighborhood concerns, what's right and what's
19· ·wrong.· I made a statement and he took issue with a
20· ·statement I had on there.
21· · · · · · ·This is a young man, young Caucasian man.
22· ·And from 9:07 a.m. that morning to 3:12 p.m. that
23· ·evening, he sent me 244 harassing e-mails.· Two
24· ·hundred and forty-four harassing e-mails

 ·1· ·threatening me, name calling me, all kinds of ugly,
·2· ·trashy things he said.· And I brought it on my
·3· ·phone, it's on my phone, where I want a detective
·4· ·to talk to me about this because anybody that does
·5· ·something like that is a nut.· And he's capable of
·6· ·doing anything to anybody.
·7· · · · · · · So I did some research to some
·8· ·neighborhood communities and I found out he used to
·9· ·work in one of those communities and he attends
10· ·that organization for their food pantry, okay.· And
11· ·so they told me that he talks nutty and acts nutty.
12· · · · · · ·Well, you know, I'm single, I live alone,
13· ·and I'm out a lot.· And so I don't want to take
14· ·this lightly.· I don't want Detective Nunez
15· ·(phonetic), who I know don't care anything about a
16· ·73-year-old senior citizen who lives alone.
17· ·Because if he did, he would have contacted me all
18· ·of the many times that I called down here to talk
19· ·to him.
20· · · · · · ·So that's why I'm here, to get somebody
21· ·to take my case.· For my safety.· I fear for my
22· ·life for a nut that would send me 244 harassing
23· ·e-mails.· That's excessive.
24· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· Okay.· May I ask, this is

·3· ·texts wasn't law enforcement.
·4· · · ·MS. MUHAMMAD:· I can't hear you.
·5· · · ·MS. ZOPP:· Was it the officer who sent the 244
·6· ·e-mails or someone else?
·7· · · ·MS. MUHAMMAD:· Obviously I was assigned to
·8· ·Detective Nunez, because he called and left me a
·9· ·voicemail message.
10· · · ·MS. ZOPP:· Who sent you the 244 e-mails?
11· · · ·MS. MUHAMMAD:· I called the police.
12· · · ·MS. ZOPP:· No, who sent you the e-mails?
13· · · ·MS. MUHAMMAD:· Oh.· His name is Chris Bertucci.
14· · · ·MS. ZOPP:· So this is somebody who is
15· ·threatening you, or you feel threatened?
16· · · ·MS. MUHAMMAD:· Of course I do.· Once you read
17· ·the e-mails -18· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· We are just trying to
19· ·understand.
20· · · ·MS. ZOPP:· So he's not a law enforcement
21· ·officer?
22· · · ·MS. MUHAMMAD:· ·Yes.· His name is Chris
23· ·B-e-r-t-u-c-c-i.
24· · · ·MS. SMITH:· But my question is, is he a police

 ·1· ·officer?· No?
·2· · · ·MS. MUHAMMAD:· Oh, no.· He's just a nut in the
·3· ·neighborhood.· He claims to be an activist in his
·4· ·e-mails.· He tells me I'm an activist, I'm married
·5· ·to a black woman, and da-da-de-de.· Well, I've been
·6· ·out here a long time and I never heard of him out
·7· ·in the community.
·8· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· We have a good
·9· ·understanding now.· So who does she speak with.
10· ·She's not getting any answers.
11· · · ·MR. WALLER:· I'll follow up with her after the
12· ·meeting, get her information -13· · · ·MS. MUHAMMAD:· Oh, please do.
14· · · ·MR. WALLER:· -- and make sure that a detective
15· ·follows up with you.· It won't be Detective Nunez.
16· ·We'll make sure someone follows up with you.
17· · · ·MS. MUHAMMAD:· Well, thank you.· I appreciate
18· ·that.
19· · · ·MS. ZOPP:· Thank you, Mr. Waller.· Thank you.
20· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· Next speaker, Octavia
21· ·Mitchell.
22· · · ·MS. MITCHELL:· Hi again.· Okay.· I'm standing
23· ·before you all, and as you know, I've been asking
24· ·for my son's DNA, Izael Jackson.· I've been asking

 ·1· ·for this DNA since March 2014 and was denied his
·2· ·DNA.
·3· · · · · · ·I understand that I'm being denied his
·4· ·DNA, but I was also told that the Illinois State
·5· ·Police Department had the DNA.· Illinois State
·6· ·Police Department says they do not have his DNA.
·7· ·Can someone from the Chicago Police Department tell
·8· ·me where -- whose custody this DNA is in?
·9· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· As you know, we spoke via
10· ·e-mail.· This is something that your attorney is
11· ·going to have to request.· You've been in front of
12· ·the judge, so from -- I ask the questions, and at
13· ·this point this is with your attorney.· Your
14· ·attorney e-mailed me, I wrote back to him, and then
15· ·I didn't hear back from him.
16· · · ·MS. MITCHELL:· I emailed you.· I e-mailed you
17· ·after that, you didn't return my email.
18· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· The issue is -19· · · ·MS. MITCHELL:· Because you had said all you had
20· ·to say, right?
21· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· Your attorney is going to
22· ·have to request this information -23· · · ·MS. MITCHELL:· That's fine.· That's fine.
24· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· -- from the judge.

 ·1· · · ·MS. MITCHELL:· That's fine.· That's fine.· I'm
·2· ·asking this independently as the estate of my son.
·3· ·I'm not asking them to give it to me at this time.
·4· ·I'm asking where is it.· Because the investigating
·5· ·officer got on the stand and said that Illinois
·6· ·State Police Department had his DNA.· Illinois
·7· ·State Police Department said that they do not have
·8· ·the DNA.· I just want to know whose custody it's
·9· ·in.· Do anyone from the City have any idea?
10· · · · · · ·Because I've been here several weeks so I
11· ·know somebody's going to do some type of
12· ·investigating to find out where this DNA is at.
13· ·I'm quite sure that someone was curious about what
14· ·DNA and what person this young lady is talking
15· ·about.· I'm not asking for it today, I just want to
16· ·know whose custody his DNA is in.
17· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· Again, I tried to research
18· ·it, and the information that I came back with was
19· ·that your attorney needs to make this request to
20· ·the judge.
21· · · ·MS. MITCHELL:· Okay.· That's fine.
22· · · · · · ·So what I want to say is if the CPD is
23· ·trying to gain trust with the citizens of the City
24· ·of Chicago, this is no way to gain trust.· If

McCorkle Litigation Services, Inc.

14

 ·1· ·you're going to lie and hide things, you will never
·2· ·get the City's trust.· And you would definitely
·3· ·never get my respect.· And that's why I want to sit
·4· ·here in front of this Board and state, if the City
·5· ·is not made to do something, they're not going to
·6· ·do it.· So they're just as worse gang as the gang
·7· ·bangers in the street.
·8· · · · · · ·Because they know where this DNA is at.
·9· ·They have this DNA, and they're taking a grieving
10· ·mother through all of this for nine years until
11· ·they are made to give me this DNA.· And you best
12· ·believe I'm going to keep pushing for this DNA till
13· ·the day I die.· Because I know they have it.
14· · · · · · · Thank you.· And I'm going to keep
15· ·standing here and I'm going to keep coming up here
16· ·and you're going to keep seeing my face.· I'm not
17· ·going away.
18· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· Okay, thank you.
19· · · · · · ·Our next speaker is John Catanzara, Jr.
20· ·Excuse me, George Blakemore.

22· ·citizens of our great County of Cook and great City

·5· ·out and took my cart and rolled it down and say I'm
·6· ·putting it in the street.· You're not going to be
·7· ·down here.
·8· · · · · · ·I took a belt or something I had and
·9· ·whammed him right across his back because he was
10· ·stealing from me by force.· And then he came back
11· ·and rolled the next one.· And I took that and
12· ·whammed his right back again.· He was robbing me
13· ·and doing in the street.
14· · · · · · ·And then when I called 911, the policeman
15· ·came and they say we saw it on the video, he's
16· ·rolling it down there.· And then I asked for a
17· ·sergeant.· And when the sergeant came, the sergeant
18· ·say we saw on his cell phone, that's his cell
19· ·phone, that you was whamming him with that bungee
20· ·hook.
21· · · · · · ·I said the I was -- if a man come and
22· ·take a lady's purse or something, she has a right
23· ·to hit him and to defend themselves.· And they lock
24· ·me up.· And when I went to the 18th District, that

13· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· Mr. Blakemore -14· · · ·MR. BLAKEMORE:· So, listen here.· Listen here,

17· ·you all check these policemen.· You have no right

12· ·the ones that came out and they said internal now,

14· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· All right.· Mr. Blakemore,
15· ·if you give this information to Max, I will make
16· ·sure that we coordinate with the Police Department

·4· ·Robert J. More, executing instructions that he
·5· ·understands are not infallible and in regard to
·6· ·which he is responsible for the execution of those
·7· ·instructions.· And he accepts that responsibility.
·8· ·And he also realizes that it's a terrible thing to

10· ·10:31.· First Timothy 5:22, never incur complicity
11· ·in anyone else's sin.
12· · · · · · ·There are 94 ways a person can incur

14· ·provocation, praise and flattery, silence defending
15· ·evil (inaudible) evil doers.
16· · · · · · ·There's murders that are Bland, Young,

·8· · · ·MR. MORE:· Oh, okay.· Got you.
·9· · · · · · ·So here is the situation.· What we have
10· ·to do is we got to modify the whole structure.· Now
11· ·it's not just the state of mind of the
12· ·Superintendent, it's got to be the state of mind of
13· ·everybody sitting in that position.· Because
14· ·authority can be delegated, responsibility can't
