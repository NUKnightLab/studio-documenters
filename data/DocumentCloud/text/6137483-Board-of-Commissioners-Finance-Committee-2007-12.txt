SHERIFF OF COOK COUNTY, Thomas J. Dart, by David S. Devane,
Executive Director, Department of Community Supervision and Intervention:
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to extend for twelve (12)
months, Contract No. 05-73-561 with HEALTHCARE ALTERNATIVE
SERVICES, INC. (HAS), Chicago, Illinois, for a substance abuse treatment
program for the Sheriff’s Department of Community Supervision and
Intervention, Day Reporting Center.
Reason: The Sheriff’s Office is exercising a one-year extension option as per
contract documents. Healthcare Alternative Systems, Inc. (HAS) has
seven (7) staff serving the population of the Day Reporting Program.
Most of the staff are Certified Alcohol and Drug Counselors who
provide classroom-size counseling or cognitive instruction focused on
substance abuse education and treatment, relapse prevention, drug
dependency education, and cognitive-behavioral restructuring. HAS
staff also provided limited individual counseling, case management,
community referrals for ancillary services, and on-site drug testing.
The expiration date of the current contract is January 8, 2008.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: $597,938.00. Contract extension: January 9, 2008
through January 8, 2009. (236-298 Account).
Approval of this item would commit Fiscal Year 2008 and future year funds.

COOK COUNTY ASSESSOR, James M. Houlihan, by John M. Fallon, Special
Assistant to the Assessor, transmitting a Communication:
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with
ACS GOVERNMENT RECORDS MANAGEMENT, Dallas, Texas, for
enhancements to the Recorder of Deeds indexing module of the 20/20 Perfect
Vision System and two (2) years of maintenance and technical support for the
Assessor’s Scanning and Document Imaging System. These enhancements
will give the Recorder of Deeds the ability to capture the additional data from
the IL PTAX-203 Transfer Declaration Form. This data is currently being
captured by the Assessor’s Office and is needed to support the Illinois
Department of Revenue’s Sales Ration Study and the Assessor’s Office
Assessment Cycle. The enhancements to the Recorder’s 20/20 System will
eliminate the duplicative data entry efforts being made by the Recorder of
Deeds and the Assessor’s Office, and give the Recorder of Deeds the ability to
capture all of the data needed by the agencies.
Reason: ACS Government Records Management (ACS) is the original vendor
for the Recorder of Deeds 20/20 Perfect Vision System and the
Assessor’s Scanning and Document Imaging System. The Recorder
of Deeds and the Assessor’s Office Imaging Systems contain ACS
proprietary software or software customized exclusively by ACS to
meet business needs. To have another vendor undertake these
enhancements and have them enter our environments to learn our
systems and business processes would be very costly and timely.
ACS fully understands the Recorder of Deeds and Assessor’s Office
Imaging Systems and the related business functions that will be
implemented, making this the best way to achieve our goals in a cost
efficient manner.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: $61,500.00. Contract period: December 1, 2007
through November 30, 2009. (040-441 Account). Requisition No. 70400037.
Approval of this item would commit Fiscal Year 2007 and 2008 funds.
The Chief Information Officer has reviewed this item and concurs with this
recommendation.

ACCURATE POSITION TITLES AND SALARY GRADES REPORT
(PROPOSED RESOLUTION). Submitting a Proposed Resolution sponsored
by Deborah Sims, County Commissioner.
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
ACCURATE POSITION TITLES AND SALARY GRADES REPORT
WHEREAS, Cook County government is in a challenging budget year and is
working on passing a balanced fiscal year 2008 budget by finding an
appropriate balance between cutting expenses and generating additional
revenues; and

 FINANCE COMMITTEE REPORT
DECEMBER 18, 2007
PAGE 35

WHEREAS, Cook County government is making concentrated efforts to cut
expenses by streamlining operations through the elimination of duplicity in
various government departments through consolidation, increasing revenue
collection efforts and improving efficiencies; and
WHEREAS, it is nearly impossible for the Board of Commissioners to make
thoughtful decisions as to whether various positions are necessary to the
operation and core missions of County departments, when many budget titles
and salary grades contained in the County budget do not accurately describe
the work being performed by people in those budgeted positions; and
WHEREAS, arbitrarily cutting positions is neither conducive to providing core
services for which this government is responsible and upon which our citizens
rely, nor to streamlining operations to run effectively and efficiently; and
WHEREAS, there is a long history of not updating position titles in the County
budget as those positions and the duties of people in those budgeted positions
have evolved over the years; and
WHEREAS, it is the desire of this Honorable Body to receive the most accurate
information available to make the necessary changes and decisions to ensure
this government will be financially viable and responsible to the taxpayers it
represents and efficiently provide the services for which it is mandated; and
WHEREAS, having the necessary information to make informed decisions on
where to make cuts if necessary, is essential to running an effective
organization.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of
Commissioners does hereby request that the Bureau of Human Resources
provide the County Board, no later than September 1, 2008, with a list of all
positions in the County, by department, which show position titles and salary
grades that accurately reflect the work being performed by people in those
positions; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Department of Budget
and Management Services shall incorporate this list of updated budget titles
and salary grades into the Cook County Board President’s fiscal year 2009
budget recommendation.
* Referred to the Committee on Finance on 11/06/07.

Reason:

This software is proprietary to the Hewlett Packard Company and
