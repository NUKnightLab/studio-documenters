RESOLUTION
RECOGNIZING OCTOBER OF 2009
AS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AWARENESS MONTH IN COOK COUNTY
WHEREAS, one third of American women report being physically abused by a husband, boyfriend or
partner at some point in their lives; and
WHEREAS, the crime of domestic violence in one way or another affects every family in Cook County;
and
WHEREAS, this form of violence is not confined to any group or groups of people, but cuts across all
ages, as well as across economic, racial and societal barriers; and
WHEREAS, domestic violence is particularly devastating because it wears a familiar face – the face of a
spouse, a parent, or a partner; and
WHEREAS, societal indifference to domestic violence contributes to the endangerment of families in
Cook County; and
WHEREAS, Cook County government recognizes the importance of educating its own workforce on
domestic violence because domestic violence often does not stay at home, but rather follows its victims to
their place of employment; and
WHEREAS, in addition to the very human toll of domestic violence, there is a very real cost to
employers in Cook County in lost wages, chronic absenteeism, excessive use of sick time and increased
medical expenses; and
WHEREAS, Cook County government, through the work of the Cook County Commission on Women’s
Issues, the Cook County Bureau of Human Resources and the Cook County Employee Assistance
Program recognizes the need to heighten employee awareness of both the County’s Domestic and Sexual
Violence Workplace Policy as well as the County’s Violence in the Workplace Policy; and
WHEREAS, collaboratively, these Cook County departments and other partners will conduct training
and provide guidance for Cook County management and employees to help them to recognize the signs
and symptoms of violence, to learn appropriate responses and procedure, and to be knowledgeable about
available resources and referrals; and
WHEREAS, raising public awareness about domestic violence, the inter-generational cycle of violence,
and the needs of victims and survivors of domestic violence are crucial to the safety and well-being of the
residents of Cook County, our families and the communities in which we live; and
WHEREAS, the dedicated professionals in Cook County who work within victim-advocacy
organizations and shelters, within our medical, public health and mental health communities, and within
our criminal justice system merit recognition and encouragement for their exceptional efforts to reduce
domestic violence, treat victims and survivors, and punish perpetrators.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the month of October is recognized as Domestic
Violence Awareness Month in Cook County; all residents and employees of Cook County are urged to
observe this month by supporting those who are working toward its end, by becoming more aware of the
tragedy of domestic violence, by learning to recognize the signs and cycles of domestic violence, and by
learning to speak out and respond to violence in our homes and in our communities.

RESOLUTION
A RESOLUTION URGING THE ILLINOIS HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES TO PASS
AND THE GOVERNOR TO SIGN, SENATE BILL 1868 CHANGING THE
VETO OVERRIDE REQUIREMENT OF THE COOK COUNTY BOARD FROM 4/5 TO 3/5
WHEREAS, a study of the Illinois Counties Code revealed that of the County Board Chief Executive
Officers in Illinois that have veto power, a 3/5 majority is required for an override with the exception of
one county; and
WHEREAS, veto override requirements of all of the municipal governments in Illinois, overriding an
executive veto requires not more than a 2/3 majority; and
WHEREAS, the override requirement for a veto of the Governor of Illinois is only 3/5; and
WHEREAS, the County of Cook is the only government in the State of Illinois with a veto override
requirement of 4/5 of the members of the legislative body; and
WHEREAS, this unprecedented veto power is inherently unfair to the citizens of Cook County who are
represented by the County Board; and
WHEREAS, on April 1, 2009, the Illinois Senate unanimously passed Senate Bill 1868 which seeks to
correct this unfair veto override requirement by amending the Counties Code to provide for the same 3/5
veto override requirement as is required in every other County with veto power.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that we urge
the Illinois House of Representatives to pass Senate Bill 1868 as currently engrossed, or any other
substantially similar legislation, and urge the Governor to sign it into law; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Clerk transmit copies of this Resolution to the
President and minority leader of the Senate, the Speaker and minority leader of the House of
Representatives and the Governor of the State of Illinois.

INTERGOVERNMENTAL AGREEMENT
ITEM #44
APPROVED
Transmitting a Communication, dated September 22, 2009 from
NANCY L. JONES, M.D., Chief Medical Examiner, Office of the Medical Examiner
requesting authorization for the Office of the Medical Examiner to enter into an Intergovernmental
Agreement with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, Georgia, to study the
potential influence of genetic polymorphisms in the ADRB2 gene on asthma mortality and to determine
how race influences this association.
Reason:

This study is designed to measure the frequency of genetic polymorphisms in ADRB2 in
people that have had a fatal asthma exacerbation. Fatal asthma cases will be identified with
help from Medical Examiner office records as people who have asthma listed as the primary
cause of death on their death certificates. Non-identifiable information will be abstracted by
CDC investigators from death certificates and medical examiner records for each case. It is
expected that science and society in general will benefit if scientists are better able to
understand the causes of differences in asthma morbidity; this information may lead to
improved intervention and prevention strategies for asthma.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: None. Contract period: November 1, 2009 through October 31, 2010.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from: 259-215, 259-237, 259-268, and 259-630.
There will not be any delays, cancellations, etc. in the 215-Scavenger Services Account that funds

There will not be any delays, cancellations, etc. in the 237-Services for Minors or the Indigent
Account that funds will be transferred from.

There will not be any delays, cancellations, etc. in the 630-Rental of Office Equipment Account
that funds will be transferred from.

4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
The amount of purchases from the 215-Scavenger Services Account fluctuates from year to year.
However, due to this surplus we have adjusted the FY2010 request to reflect this account's
decreased spending.
The amount of purchases from the 237-Services for Minors or the Indigent Account fluctuates from
year to year. The number of cases from day to day cannot be determined; therefore, we are unable
to estimate how many cases will require County burial after cases are sent to funeral homes or
Veterans' Affairs. Due to this surplus, we have adjusted our FY2010 request to reflect this
account's decreased spending.
The amount of purchases from the 268-Court Reporting, Stenographic, Transcribing, or Interpreter
Services Account fluctuates from year to year. Given that the volume of cases and the length of
these cases will change from year to year, it is difficult to determine how many cases and lines will
be used in a year's contract. For much of 2009, we were using moneys encumbered from a 2007
contract. Due to this surplus, we have adjusted our FY2010 request to reflect this account's
decreased spending.
The amount of purchases from the 630-Rental of Office Equipment Account fluctuates from year to

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED AS FOLLOWS:
The foregoing recitals are incorporated herein as findings of the Board of Commissioners of Cook
County, Illinois.
a.
The Property Defined. The Lake Parcel and the Crawford Parcel are hereinafter referred to
collectively as the “Property.” The property on which the Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County and other

b.
Conveyance Authorized. The Board hereby determines that the conveyance of the Lake Parcel
and the Crawford Parcel to the District is in the public interest. The Board hereby authorizes the
conveyance of the Property to the District by quit claim deed, in consideration of a total purchase price of
$15,050,000.00 (the “Purchase Price”), for the public purposes of preserving the existing burial areas in
an appropriate manner and as required by applicable laws, protecting and preserving historic sites, and
protecting and preserving the flora, fauna and scenic beauties, in accordance with the District’s authority.
It is hereby acknowledged that the County has already received $13,261,066.00 from the District pursuant

d.
Joint Planning Effort. The Board hereby recognizes that the history of the Property’s use by the
County and the history embodied on the site require careful consideration and planning of future uses, and
should be appropriately preserved and commemorated in a manner conducive to education of the public,
and that such planning and preservation is the responsibility of both Cook County and of the District. The
Board further recognizes that access to and uses of the Property require ongoing planning and cooperation
and will impact the County, Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County, and the District. Therefore, the Board
hereby authorizes the President and his designees to engage in a joint planning effort incorporating
historic preservation, investigations, environmental restoration, and planning for the District’s proposed
use of the Property and the impacts of such use on the Oak Forest Hospital Campus. Further, the Board
hereby directs the Comptroller to set aside from the proceeds of closing $150,000.00 to be utilized to pay
one-half the cost of such efforts, including the retention of consultants, planners and other experts, it
being understood that the District will likewise pay one-half the cost.

JOSEPH SOVA, Chief, Bureau of Human Resources
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to negotiate and enter into a Joint Purchasing
Agreement for a professional services contract on behalf of Cook County with Taleo Corporation
(“Taleo”), Almeda, California, to provide an automated recruiting, hiring, and onboarding system that can

Preserve District.
Taleo offers a nationally recognized automated recruiting, hiring and onboarding system to both private

currently engaged by the City of Chicago to provide hosting and maintenance support services so that the
City of Chicago (“City”) has an automated recruiting, hiring and onboarding system. On September 30,
1996, the City engaged the services of Taleo to perform various Project Definition Services and as a result
made certain analyses and recommendations to the City concerning the use of Taleo’s software services
for the purpose of improving the City’s hiring processes. After considering Taleo’s recommendations, on
February 20, 2007, the City amended its original agreement to provide for the implementation of Taleo’s
software services and to have Taleo provide hosting, and maintenance support services so that the City
would have an automated recruiting, hiring and onboarding system.
Due to Taleo’s familiarity and experience with providing automated hiring in both private and public
organizations as well as healthcare institutions and its successful relationship in implementing the City’s
automated hiring system, the Bureau of Human Resources hereby requests that the Purchasing Agent and
the Bureau of Human Resources be authorized to negotiate project definition services, implementation
services, system licenses, and the appropriate schedules of compensation to engage Taleo in the provision
and implementation of Taleo Software services as well as the hosting, maintenance and support services
to provide for the automated recruiting, hiring and onboarding system for Cook County.

ITEM #76
APPROVED
Transmitting a Communication, dated August 12, 2009 from
ANITA ALVAREZ, Cook County State's Attorney
by
RAYMOND BALCARCEL, Chief Financial Officer
requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners to transfer funds totaling $275,000.00 from and to
the accounts listed below.
Reason:

Although every effort is made each year to accurately budget our non-personnel operating
accounts given the current fiscal constraints, many of these costs vary from year to year and
are difficult to predict. This reallocation of less than one half of one percent of our budget
should be sufficient for the remainder of the fiscal year.

To Accounts:

1.

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
240: This account is currently in a negative balance. After reviewing the July 31 balances it was
determined that a transfer was advisable. The 7/31 balance was $7,040.00; the 6/30 balance was
$5,169.00 (the increased balance was due to a canceled purchase order). The transition to a new
administration required the printing of new letterhead, envelopes, business cards and other
materials, the costs of which were slightly underestimated.
268: This account is currently in a negative balance. After reviewing the July 31 balances it was
determined that a transfer was advisable. The 7/31 balance was $74,619.00; the 6/30 balance was
$193,535.00. This account is used to pay for court transcripts provided by the Official Court
Reporters. After the submission of the budget, the statutory per page fees for these transcripts were
increased by approximately 25% for 2009.
440: This account currently has a negative balance. The 7/31 balance and the 6/30 balance were
both $59,236.00. After the budget was passed, it was determined that our two heavy duty copiers at
26th Street are not covered under the county wide maintenance agreements, resulting in the need
for this transfer.
441: This account is not currently in a negative balance, but after reviewing the July 31 balances it
was determined that a transfer was advisable. The 7/31 balance was $38,316.00; the 6/30 balance
was $39,368.00. The maintenance and support contract for our Juvenile case management system,
payable prior to the end of the current fiscal year is for approximately $44,000.00.

660: This account is currently in a negative balance. After reviewing the July 31 balances it was
determined that a transfer was advisable. The 7/31 balance was $8,017.00; the 6/30 balance was
$13,497.00. On July 21, 2009 the Real Estate Management Division of the Department of Planning
and Development asked the Board of Commissioners to approve a one year extension, effective
September 1, of the lease for our warehouse space at 5410 West Roosevelt, since our intended
space at 23rd and Rockwell was not yet ready. This resulted in an additional obligation of three
months' rent which was not included in our original budget.
2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
Accounts 217, 225, 263, 445: After reviewing the July 31 balances, and projecting expenses
through the end of the fiscal year, we have identified these accounts as having sufficient surplus for
transfer.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from 250-217, 250-225, 250-263 and 250-445.
None.

4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
217: This account is used for the travel expenses of witnesses brought in from out of town to
testify, and for the extradition of prisoners from other jurisdictions. Expenses this year have been
10% to 15% lower than originally anticipated, resulting in this surplus.
225: Despite the recent increase in postal rates, our total postage expenses have been slightly
lower than our original projections due to the increased use of electronic media.
263: This account provides for the hiring of outside counsel, primarily in civil cases where special
expertise is required or where potential conflicts of interest may exist. It is difficult to predict these
cases in advance, and 2009 costs have been slightly less than original estimates.
445: This account pays for gasoline. At the time the budget was prepared, prices were significantly
higher than current levels.

Reason:

The Bad Check Restitution Program was established by Illinois statute to divert from
prosecution individuals who write bad checks, with the condition that they make restitution
and complete an educational program. This program is funded by administrative fees paid by
the participants, with any additional revenues to be used in the enforcement and prosecution
of criminal laws. At the time the budget was established, we were still evaluating a number
of possible spending plans; the funding was placed in the Appropriations Adjustment
Account with the intention of later transferring the funds, with Board approval, as needed.
This transfer would allow previously unallocated funds to be used for the purchase of trial
technology and courtroom presentation equipment to be used in the felony trial courtrooms.
