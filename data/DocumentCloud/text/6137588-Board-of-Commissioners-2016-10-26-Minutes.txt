COMMEMORATING THE EXTRAORDINARY LIFE
OF THE HONORABLE DONALD PERILLE
WHEREAS, Don Perille, longtime Skokie Village Trustee and Plan Commission Chairman whose vision
and wisdom helped shape the Village of Skokie died on September 12, 2016 at the age of 88 leaving behind
family, countless friends and a community profoundly enriched for having known him; and
WHEREAS, Don Perille served as chairman of the Skokie Plan Commission during some of the most
turbulent times in the history of the Commission and in the village of Skokie. With him at the helm guiding
the process, Skokie transitioned from being a farming community into the modern, economically thriving,
multicultural municipality it is today. His term was notable as much as for its impact on the community as
for its length; he joined the Plan Commission as a young man in his 30s and remained in Skokie government
for over half a century. In all, Perille spent the first 28 years on the Plan Commission, 25 of them as
chairman, and the last 24 years as a village trustee; and
WHEREAS, as Plan Commission Chairman, Don Perille came up with a new way to measure the height
of a building, a pyramid zoning formula that became widely known as "the Perille concept." This concept
resulted in the charming and often imitated nature of the present day Old Orchard Mall. In his later years
on the Village Board, he chaired the Landlord Tenant Advisory Committee and is credited with bringing
together people with very polarized views about regulating rental housing in Skokie; and
WHEREAS, Don Perille represented the highest qualities of public service, citizenship and humanity
through his decades of work on behalf of all of the people of Skokie. He will long be remembered for
reinvigorating Westfield Old Orchard, crafting the village's comprehensive flood control program, the
relocation of the Illinois Holocaust Museum from its cramped storefront home into its verdant location near

Skokie is presently a village which has a depth of diversity rivaled by few on the planet. With his support,
Skokie has become a village of many voices; a community where over 50 languages are regularly spoken
and where diverse cultures are respected and celebrated. He was instrumental in establishing the Skokie
Festival of Cultures, which has grown exponentially over the years and currently celebrates over three
dozen cultures, welcomes 30,000 visitors annually and has been honored with numerous state and national
art event programming awards; and
WHEREAS, Don Perille served his country during the war in Korea which interrupted his college career
at the University of Illinois. In Korea, he ran the Purchase and Contracting Office for all Air Force
construction in Korea and sponsored and cared for a young Korean orphan, named Skoshi; and
WHEREAS, throughout his long and amazing life Don Perille was intellectually curious and regularly
embraced new concepts and new adventures. He was a longtime admirer and supporter of the arts. He
recognized the vital role that the arts play in civic life and was a subscriber to no less than five theater series
across the Chicagoland area; and

WHEREAS, aside from his work serving the citizens of his beloved community Don Perille had two
careers, his longest was in the valve industry where he worked for several companies as sales manager,
marketing manager or vice president. He later took a job as purchasing agent for the Cook County Circuit
Court for the next fifteen years before he retired; and
WHEREAS, Don Perille’s was a singular presence in the city of Skokie; he was honored by the Village
for his 50 years of political, civic, and philanthropic service in 2011 and was regularly sought out for his
wisdom and expertise. He was described by Skokie Mayor George Van Dusen as "an undisputed expert in
land use”; and
WHEREAS, Don Perille was well known for his tireless commitment to his community. He served on the
board of Rush North Shore Hospital and later the North Suburban Healthcare Foundation. Don exemplified
the values contained in the commandment to love thy neighbor as thyself and he will be particularly missed
by those at his beloved Saint Peter Parish; and
WHEREAS, the Community has lost a great friend in Don Perille. He will be sorely missed by his friends,
neighbors and colleagues. His loss will be felt most acutely by his children Christopher (Christine) Perille,
Lisa (Paul) Sabourin, Amy Perille-Ball (Kevin Ball), Steve (Tamara) Perille, Laura Perille (John Riordan),
and Gina Perille; grandchildren Matt (Lisa Nickele), Karen, Emilie, Daniel, Coleman, Grace, Katherine,

October 26, 2016

WHEREAS, Dr. Willie Wilson bailed out six non-violent detainees from the Cook County Jail in
September of 2016; and
WHEREAS, those six individuals were being held for minor offenses and could not make bail, meaning
they would have remained in the Cook County Jail until their trial ended; and
WHEREAS, in November of 2016, Dr. Wilson plans to use $100,000 of his own money to bail out nonviolent offenders so they will be able to spend this Thanksgiving with their families; and
WHEREAS, this is the latest in a long line of philanthropic efforts Dr. Wilson has made to improve life
for Chicagoans; and
WHEREAS, Cook County Corrections facilities currently hold in excess of 300 inmates who are only
incarcerated because they cannot afford to pay their bond; and
WHEREAS, the bond amount for the aforementioned individuals is $1,000.00 or less; and
WHEREAS, approximately 55 percent of these individuals are currently being held on misdemeanor
charges that carry a maximum imprisonment penalty of 364 days in a County Detention Facility; and
WHEREAS, Dr. Wilson’s selfless act in September of 2016 has saved taxpayers thousands of dollars, and
his similarly planned initiative for Thanksgiving will save much more; and
WHEREAS, Dr. Wilson serves as an outstanding mentor for formerly incarcerated individuals, as he has
come from humble roots to build a multi-million dollar business; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners ought to follow in Dr. Wilson’s footsteps and
advocate with haste for bail reform that will enable low-level detainees to not waste their lives in the Cook
County Jail as they await trial.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President of the Cook County Board and the Cook
County Board of Commissioners support the efforts of Dr. Willie Wilson to mitigate the worst impacts of
excessive bail bond fees; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the President of the Cook County Board and the Board of

CHAIR OF HONOR RECOGNIZING AMERICAN PRISONERS OF WAR
AND MISSING IN ACTION
WHEREAS, since the founding of our nation, millions of courageous men and women have answered the
call to defend democracy both at home and abroad, and many have made the ultimate sacrifice in the fight
for freedom, liberty and peace; and
WHEREAS, we support the valiant efforts of our men and women who serve in the Army, Navy, Marine
Corps, Air Force and Coast Guard and hope for their safe return at all times; and
WHEREAS, there are currently 83,204 unaccounted for U.S. personnel, including 73,547 from World War

love of country and their commitment to defending our nation; and
WHEREAS, we urge the U.S. government to never give up pursuing the safe return of all POWs and MIAs;
and
WHEREAS, the creation of a Prisoners of War/Missing in Action (POW/MIA) chair in the Cook County
Board Room will be a reminder that many American prisoners of war were left behind after previous wars
and many other military personnel were missing in action. The chair also will enable the County Board
Members to pay tribute to those individuals who made such a great sacrifice for their country; and
WHEREAS, the establishment of a POW/MIA chair will properly acknowledge the past and protect future
Veterans from being left behind should they become prisoners of war or go missing in action.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Board of Commissioners of Cook County that the

RESOLUTION CALLING FOR A PUBLIC HEARING ON PRE-TRIAL DETENTION AND THE
OPERATION OF BOND COURT
WHEREAS, Illinois’ Bail Statute, 725 ILCS 5/110-1, et seq, mandates that the amount of bail shall be
considerate of the financial ability of the accused; and
WHEREAS, a class action lawsuit was filed on October 14, 2016 alleging that release-eligible arrestees
are detained pretrial at Cook County jail solely because they are unable to pay the amount of money fixed
as a financial condition of their release; and
WHEREAS, the class action lawsuit also alleges that reliance on monetary bond results in a disparate
impact on African Americans that constitutes illegal race discrimination in violation of the Illinois Civil
Rights Act; and
WHEREAS, Cook County jail receives over 70,000 admissions every year; and
WHEREAS, 8,248 individuals were being detained at Cook County Jail as of October 17, 2016; and
WHEREAS, Cook County spends $330 million yearly to maintain jail operations; and
WHEREAS, approximately 90% of those detained in Cook County jail have not yet been convicted of

WHEREAS, the average length of stay in Cook County jail is 59 days; and
28

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

October 26, 2016

WHEREAS, 271 individuals were detained solely due to their inability to post a bond of $1,000 or less as
of October 17, 2016; and
WHEREAS, 1,024 “turnarounds” were held in Cook County jail last year — individuals who spent so
much time in custody that, once they were sentenced to state prison, they already had served every day of
their prison sentence, on average each serving 2½ months of extra time; and
WHEREAS, a 2013 evaluation of Cook County Criminal justice data showed that 63% of detainees are
unable to post bond; and
WHEREAS, Cook County spends an estimated $143 per day to house the average pre-trial detainee in
Cook County jail, with higher costs associated with detaining individuals requiring mental health treatment;
and
WHEREAS, studies have shown that pre-trial detention is more expensive than the pre-trial supervision
programs that allow individuals to return to their communities and continue working; and
WHEREAS, judges have the discretion to set bond based on individual factors and these decisions
determine whether an individual will remain in the community and continue to work and attend school, or
remain incarcerated; and
WHEREAS, judges are required by the Code of Criminal Procedure to consider more than 30 statutory
factors pertaining to the nature of the charge(s) against the defendant, his or her criminal history, prior
instances of failure to appear, and the defendant's home and community information, such as place of
residence, family ties, employment, education, character, and mental condition; and
WHEREAS, judicial decisions on bonds and release conditions varies considerably by judge; and
WHEREAS, judges spend approximately 37 seconds and sometimes as few as 10 seconds listening to
information on the charged arrest and any mitigating factors before determining bond; and
WHEREAS, as a matter of practice, judges impose financial conditions without making an inquiry into
and findings concerning a defendant’s ability to pay the amount ordered; and
WHEREAS, the average bond amounts set by judges are out of reach for the majority of pre-trial detainees;
and
WHEREAS, the average monetary bond was $71,878, yet the median household income in Cook County
is $54,648; and
WHEREAS, African Americans are disproportionately detained on monetary bonds through their pretrial
period; and
WHEREAS, between the years 2011 and 2013, only 15.8% of African Americans charged with a Class
4 felony were released on bond, while 32.4% of non-African Americans charged with a Class 4 felony
were released on bond; and
29

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

October 26, 2016

WHEREAS, other jurisdictions, such as Washington D.C., have successfully ended the reliance on
monetary bond and have established non-monetary alternatives; and
WHEREAS, a number of other jurisdictions do not detain arrestees prior to trial solely on lack of ability
to pay and instead employ pre-trial supervision programs that often achieve court-appearance rates of over

Summary: This contract will provide a universal carrier setup that will alleviate the need for Election

center technicians. An “always-on” electronic pollbook system allows for real-time tracking of voting
issues and notifications of possible issues in the precincts.
Competitive bidding procedures were followed in accordance with the Cook County Procurement Code.
Bids were solicited for electronic pollbook workstations and protective cases. Election Works, Inc. was
the lowest, responsive and responsible bidder.

AN ORDINANCE CREATING A MINIMUM WAGE IN COOK COUNTY
WHEREAS, Cook County, Illinois is a home-rule unit of government under Article VII, Section 6(a) of the
1970 Constitution of the State of Illinois and, as such, may regulate for the protection of the public welfare;
and
WHEREAS, promoting the welfare of those who work within the County's borders is an endeavor that
plainly meets this criterion; and
WHEREAS, enacting a minimum wage for workers in Cook County that exceeds the state minimum wage
is entirely consistent with the Illinois General Assembly's finding that it "is against public policy for an
employer to pay to his employees an amount less than that fixed by" the Illinois Minimum Wage Law, 820
ILCS 105/2.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that Chapter
42 Human Relations, Article I In General, Division 2 Cook County Minimum Wage Ordinance, Sections 427 through 42-19 of the Cook County Code are hereby enacted as follows:

thereunder. For purposes of this Section, prohibited adverse actions include, but are not limited to,

There has been no purchase for value and the buildings and other
structures have been vacant and unused for less than 24
continuous months.

The finding of abandonment, along with the specification of the special circumstances, shall be
included in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and consenting to the Class 6b application. If
the Ordinance or Resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the County Board is required
to validate such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b, and a
County Resolution to that effect shall be obtained. The applicant must obtain the municipal
enabling Ordinance with the required finding of special circumstances and present such municipal
Ordinance to the Board of Commissioners of Cook County prior to its determination as to whether
it will validate such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b
and provide a County Resolution to that effect. A certified copy of an Ordinance or Resolution
finding that special circumstances exist, as well as a certified copy of a County Ordinance or
Resolution validating such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class
6b need not be filed at the time of filing the Class 6b eligibility application with the Assessor, but
must be filed with the Assessor no later than the date an assessment appeal is filed to request the
class change to Class 6b. If the Resolution is not filed at the time of the Class 6b eligibility
application, the applicant shall instead file, at that time, a letter from the municipality or the County
as the case may be, confirming that a Resolution or Ordinance regarding special circumstances has
been requested.
If the real estate is located within an Industrial Growth Zone, prior to filing a Class 6b eligibility
application with the Assessor and in lieu of an Ordinance or Resolution, an applicant must obtain
from an authorized officer of the municipality or an authorized officer of the Cook County Bureau
of Economic Development if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, a letter stating that

must demonstrate that the industrial development project qualifies for the Class 6b classification
and shall bear the expense of doing so.
Temporary Emergency Economic Recovery Modification (TEERM) Program: In the instance
where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as defined herein, the

circumstances justify finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purpose of a Class 6b
under the TEERM Program if there has been no purchase for value and the buildings and other
structures have been vacant and unused for at least 12 continuous months. The finding of
abandonment, along with the specification of the special circumstances, shall be included in the

Program. If the Ordinance or Resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the County Board
122

is required to validate such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class
6b, and a County Resolution to that effect shall be obtained. The applicant must obtain the
municipal enabling Ordinance with the required finding of special circumstances and present such
municipal Ordinance to the Board of Commissioners of Cook County prior to its determination as
to whether it will validate such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of
Class 6b and provide a County Resolution to that effect. A certified copy of an Ordinance or
Resolution finding that special circumstances exist, as well as a certified copy of a County
Ordinance or Resolution validating such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for
purposes of Class 6b need not be filed at the time of filing the Class 6b application with the
Assessor, but must be filed with the Assessor no later than the date an assessment appeal is filed to
request the class change to Class 6b. If the Resolution is not filed at the time of the Class 6b
application, the applicant shall instead file, at that time, a letter from the municipality or the County
as the case may be, confirming that a Resolution or Ordinance regarding special circumstances has
been requested.
Sustainable Emergency Relief (SER) Program: In the instance where real estate does not meet the
definition of abandoned property as defined herein, the municipality or the County Board, as the
case may be, may still determine that special circumstances justify finding that the property is
deemed "qualified" for purpose of Class 6b under the SER Program if:
1.

The industrial enterprise that occupies the premises has been at
the same location for a minimum of ten years prior to the date of
application for the SER Program; and

2.

The industrial enterprise that occupies the premises submits
evidence of hardship supporting a determination that participation
in the SER Program is necessary for the industrial enterprise to
continue operations at its current location and maintain its staff,
and that without such designation the industrial enterprise would
not be economically viable causing the property to be in imminent
risk of becoming vacant and unused.

The finding that a property is qualified, along with the specification of the special
circumstances, and a determination that the applicant's participation in the SER Program is
necessary for the industrial enterprise to continue operations at its current location and
maintain its staff, and that without such designation the industrial enterprise would not be
economically viable causing the property to be in imminent risk of becoming vacant and
unused, shall be included in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and consenting to the
Class 6b application. If the Ordinance or Resolution is that of a municipality, the approval
of the County Board is required to validate such a finding that the property is deemed
"qualified" for purposes of Class 6b, and a County Resolution to that effect shall be
obtained. The applicant must obtain the municipal enabling Ordinance with the required
finding of special circumstances and present such municipal Ordinance to the Board of
Commissioners of Cook County prior to its determination as to whether it will validate
such a finding that the property is deemed "qualified" for purposes of Class 6b and provide

Resolution validating such a finding that the property is deemed "qualified" for purposes
of Class 6b need not be filed at the time of filing the Class 6b application with the Assessor,
but must be filed with the Assessor no later than the date an assessment appeal is filed to
request the class change to Class 6b. If the Resolution is not filed at the time of the Class
6b application, the applicant shall instead file, at that time, a letter from the municipality
or the County as the case may be, confirming that a Resolution or Ordinance regarding
special circumstances has been requested.
Applications for the TEERM Program or SER Program under a Class 6b application must
be received by the Assessor's Office on or before November 30, 2018 to receive
consideration.
The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of annual reports by recipients of Class 6b
incentives granted pursuant to the SER Program as to the use of the property and the
number of persons employed at the Class 6b site. In such reports, recipients shall be
required to certify whether the industrial enterprise that occupied the premises at the time
of the SER application continues its operations at that location. In addition, recipients of
Class 6b incentives granted pursuant to the SER Program shall be required to report to the
Assessor within 30 days if the industrial enterprise that occupied the premises at the time
of the SER application ceases operations at that location. A copy of such reports will be
forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the County Board for distribution to
members of the County Board from the affected districts. Failure to file such reports within
the time established by the Assessor's rules shall result in loss of the incentive for the period
relating to the non-filing. Additionally, if the industrial enterprise that occupied the
premises at the time of the SER application ceases operations at that location, then the
Class 6b incentive granted pursuant to the SER program shall terminate.
e.This classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the date such new
construction (excluding demolition, if any) or such substantial rehabilitation was
completed and initially assessed, or in the case of abandoned property, from the
date of substantial re-occupancy, or in the case of incentives granted pursuant to
the TEERM Program, from the date of the notice of approval. In the case of
incentives granted pursuant to the SER Program, this classification shall continue
for a period of 12 years from the date of the notice of approval, or until the
industrial enterprise that occupied the premises at the time of the SER application
ceases operations at that location if that occurs sooner.
f.Unless a Class 6b granted pursuant to the TEERM Program or the SER Program,
this incentive may be renewed during the last year a property is entitled to a ten
percent assessment level pursuant to Section 74-64(7), if the following
requirements are met:
1.

2.

The municipality in which the real estate is located or the County
Board, if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area,
adopts a Resolution expressly stating that the municipality or the
County Board, as the case may be, has determined that the
industrial use of the property is necessary and beneficial to the
local economy, and supports and consents to renewal of the Class
6b; provided, however, that if the real estate is located within an
Industrial Growth Zone, in lieu of a Resolution, may provide from
an authorized officer of the municipality or an authorized officer
of the Cook County Bureau of Economic Development if the real
estate is located in an unincorporated area, a certified letter stating
that the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be,
supports and consents to the renewal of the Class 6b; and

3.

A copy of that Resolution or certified authorization letter (if
applicable) and a completed renewal application are filed with the
Assessor's Office before the expiration of the ten percent
assessment level period.

g.Class 6b incentives that are granted pursuant to the TEERM Program or SER
Program are not renewable. For all other Class 6b incentives, the number of
renewal periods is not limited as long as the property continues to apply and meet
the requirements for Class 6b.
h.A copy of the request for renewal of the incentive will be forwarded by the
Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the County Board for distribution to members
of the County Board from the affected districts.
i.If no renewal is obtained, the incentive shall be phased out over the next two
years, pursuant to Section 74-64(7). After expiration of the last incentive period,
the real estate shall revert to the applicable classification under this Division.
j.The Assessor may adopt rules consistent with this subsection necessary to ensure
proper review of all factors relevant to determine eligibility for the benefits
provided under Class 6b.
k.The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports
by all Class 6b recipients as to the use of the property and the number of persons
employed at the Class 6b site. A copy of such reports will be forwarded by the
Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the County Board for distribution to members
of the County Board from the affected districts. Failure to file such reports within
the time established by the Assessor's rules shall result in loss of the incentive for
the period relating to the non-filing.

including abandoned property, as defined in Section 74-62, including the land upon
which such property is situated; or vacant land; where such real estate because of

contamination has undergone environmental testing and remediation and has
received a "No Further Remediation Letter" from the site remediation program.
a.To be eligible for a Class C classification an applicant must have received a "No
Further Remediation Letter" confirming achievement of the remediation
objectives based on the industrial or commercial use.
b.The owner of the property is rendered ineligible for the Class C classification by
having previously owned or operated the site, directly or indirectly, or having been
a partner or being associated through a family or business relationship with anyone
who has owned or operated the site, which ownership or operation caused the
contamination which was remediated pursuant to a site remediation, except for an
employee who worked for an owner, as defined herein, that operated the site. A
present owner or employer who can successfully demonstrate that the owner or
employer was not responsible for the contamination may be eligible for Class C
classification.
c.An applicant must obtain from the municipality in which the real estate is located
or the County Board if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, an
Ordinance or Resolution expressly stating that the municipality or County Board,
as the case may be, has determined that the incentive provided by Class C is
necessary for development to occur on that specific real estate and that the
municipality or County Board, as the case may be, supports and consents to the
Class C application to the Assessor. A certified copy of the Ordinance or
Resolution must be filed at the time of application for the Class C classification. A
copy of that Ordinance or Resolution, whichever is submitted, will be forwarded
by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the Board for distribution to the
members of the County Board from the affected districts.
d.To qualify for the Class C classification, an application for Class C classification
must be made within one year of the receipt of the "No Further Remediation
Letter". Where an application for Class C classification encompasses less than all
of the contiguous property owned by the applicant upon which remediation has
been completed, the one-year limitation will be waived for any subsequent separate
application for Class C classification for the remainder or for additional portions
of the property, provided that such subsequent application is made within seven
years.
e.Additionally, to qualify for the Class C classification, the estimated remediation
costs, including site investigation, testing, oversight, remediation and removal
costs, monitoring, and engineering and legal fees associated with the remediation
process, must total at least $100,000.00, or alternatively, must total at least 25
percent of the market value of the real estate as determined by the Assessor's
property record card in the year prior to the remediation, whichever is less.
f.The initial Class C classification shall continue for a period of 12 years for both
industrial and commercial property. For industrial property, this incentive may be
126

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

October 26, 2016

renewed during the last year a property is entitled to a 16-percent assessment level,
if the following requirements are met:
1.

The taxpayer notifies the Assessor's Office of the taxpayer's intent
to request renewal of the incentive from the municipality, or the
County Board if the real estate is located in an unincorporated
area;

2.

The municipality in which the real estate is located or the County
Board, if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area,
adopts a Resolution expressly stating that the municipality or
County Board, as the case may be, has determined that the
industrial use of the property is necessary and beneficial to the
local economy, and supports and consents to renewal of the Class
C; and

3.

A copy of that Resolution and a completed renewal application
are filed with the Office of the Assessor before the expiration of
the 16-percent assessment level period.

The number of renewal periods is not limited as long as the property continues to apply and qualify
for Class C. Any property which applies for Class C treatment on or before the adoption date of the
ordinance from which this division is derived will be eligible for this renewal term at the end of
their original incentive period subject to the above requirements. The notice of intent to request
renewal which is filed with the Assessor's Office will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the
Secretary of the Board for distribution to members of the County Board from the effected districts.
g.If, on November 23, 1999, a property is receiving Class C treatment, but the
assessment level is higher than 16 percent, that taxpayer may apply for renewal as
outlined above and receive a 16-percent assessment level for the prescribed period
beginning after the filing and approval of the resolution and renewal application.
However, if, as of that effective date, the taxpayer's assessment is higher than 16
percent and the taxpayer is granted a renewal of the incentive for subsequent years,
no reduction of the current assessment level based on renewal of the incentive will
be granted. If no renewal is obtained, the incentive shall be phased out over the
next two years, pursuant to Section 74-64. After such ten-year period expiration of
the last incentive period, the real estate shall revert to the applicable classification
under this Division.
h.For commercial properties, once the original 12-year incentive period has
expired, the commercial Class C incentive will expire. The incentive classification
will not be subject to renewal and the real estate shall revert to the applicable
classification under this Division.
i.The Assessor shall review the application and supporting documentation to
determine eligibility for the Class C classification. The Assessor may adopt rules
consistent with the foregoing necessary to ensure proper review of all factors
127

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

relevant to determine initial and continued eligibility for the benefits provided
under the Class C classification.
j.The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports
by all Class C recipients as to the use of the property and the number of persons
employed at the Class C site. Such reports shall be verified. Failure to file such
reports within the time established by the Assessor's rules shall result in loss of the
incentive for the period relating to the non-filing.

Class 7a. Real estate used primarily for commercial purposes, comprising a
qualified commercial development project, as determined pursuant to Section 7465(a), located in an area in need of commercial development, where total
development costs, exclusive of land, do not exceed $2,000,000.00, consisting of
all newly constructed buildings or other structures, including the land upon which
they are situated; or abandoned property, as defined in this Division, including the
land upon which such property is situated; or all buildings and other structures
which are substantially rehabilitated to the extent such rehabilitation has added to
their value, including qualified land related to the rehabilitation. Land qualifies
when the rehabilitation adds vertical or horizontal square footage to the
improvements. The amount of land eligible for the incentive shall be in such
proportion as the square footage added by the rehabilitation bears to the total
square footage of the improvements on the parcel.
a.In the instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned
property as defined herein, the municipality or the County Board, as the case may
be, may still determine that special circumstances justify that the property is
deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 7a. The finding of abandonment, along
with the specification of the special circumstances, shall be included in the
Resolution or Ordinance supporting and consenting to the Class 7a application.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, special circumstances may not be determined to
justify finding that a property is deemed "abandoned" where:
A.There has been a purchase for value and the buildings and other
structures have not been vacant and unused prior to such purchase; or
B.There has been no purchase for value and the buildings and other
structures have been vacant and unused for less than 24 continuous
months.

Such Resolution or Ordinance must be filed with the eligibility application. If the
Ordinance or Resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the County Board is
required to validate such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes
of Class 7a and a Resolution to that effect shall be included with the Class 7a eligibility
application filed with the Assessor.
b.This classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the date such new
construction (excluding demolition, if any) or such substantial rehabilitation was
128

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

completed and initially assessed, or in the case of abandoned property, from the
date of substantial re-occupancy. After such 12-year period, the real estate shall
revert to the applicable classification under this Division.
c.The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports
by all Class 7a recipients as to the use of the property and the number of persons
employed at the Class 7a site. Such reports shall be verified. Failure to file such
reports within the time established by the Assessor's rules shall result in loss of the
incentive for the period relating to the non-filing.
(10)

Class 7b. Real estate used primarily for commercial purposes, as defined in this
Division, comprising a qualified commercial development project, as determined
pursuant to Section 74-65(a), located in an "area in need of commercial

$2,000,000.00, consisting of all newly constructed buildings or other structures,
including the land upon which they are situated; or abandoned property, as defined
herein, including the land upon which such property is situated; or all buildings
and other structures which are substantially rehabilitated to the extent such
rehabilitation has added to their value, including qualified land related to the
rehabilitation. Land qualifies when the rehabilitation adds vertical or horizontal
square footage to the improvements. The amount of land eligible for the incentive
shall be in such proportion as the square footage added by the rehabilitation bears
to the total square footage of the improvements on the parcel.
a.In the instance where real estate does not meet the definition of
abandoned property as defined herein, the municipality or the County
Board, as the case may be, may still determine that special circumstances
justify finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of
Class 7b. The finding of abandonment, along with the specification of the
special circumstances, shall be included in the Resolution or Ordinance
supporting and consenting to the Class 7b application. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, special circumstances may not be determined to justify
finding that a property is deemed "abandoned" where:
A.There has been a purchase for value and the buildings and other
structures have not been vacant and unused prior to such purchase;
or
B.There has been no purchase for value and the buildings and
other structures have been vacant and unused for less than 24

Such Resolution or Ordinance must be filed with the eligibility application. If the ordinance
or resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the County Board is required to

primarily for commercial purposes, consisting of all newly constructed buildings
or other structures, including the land upon which they are situated; or abandoned
property, including the land upon which such property is situated; or all buildings
and other structures which are substantially rehabilitated to the extent such
rehabilitation has added to their value, including qualified land related to the
rehabilitation. Land qualifies when the rehabilitation adds vertical or horizontal
square footage to the improvements. The amount of land eligible for the incentive
shall be in such proportion as the square footage added by the rehabilitation bears
to the total square footage of the improvements on the parcel.
a.An applicant must obtain from the municipality in which the real estate is located
or the County Board if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, an
Ordinance or Resolution expressly stating that:
(i)The property, site, or area is deemed a redevelopment priority by the
municipality, and
(ii)The municipality or County Board, as the case may be, has determined
that the incentive provided by Class 7c is necessary for development to
occur on that specific real estate and that the municipality or County
Board, as the case may be, supports and consents to the Class 7c
application to the Assessor.

In order to determine Class 7c applications, an application for Class 7c shall be submitted
to the Assessor and the Bureau of Economic Development. Upon receipt of the application
and all the necessary supporting data, the Economic Development Advisory Committee of
the County, within 30 days return the application to the Assessor with a finding stating
whether the conditions of Subsections (a)(1)-(a)(4) of this Section are present. The
Assessor shall review the application, supporting data, findings of the Committee and other
appropriate facts. Where the Assessor finds the conditions of Subsections (a)(1)-(a)(4) of
this Section exist, the Assessor shall, within 30 days of the receipt of the Committee's
findings, certify the commercial development project eligible for Class 7c treatment under
this Division.

Where the Economic Development Advisory Committee does not return a finding stating
whether the conditions of Subsections (a)(1)-(a)(4) of this Section are present within 30
days, and upon further application of the requesting party, the Assessor may review the
application, supporting data, and other appropriate facts and certify the commercial
development project eligible for Class 7c treatment and grant the incentive.
(1)

That the Property's (the real estate that is subject of the Incentive application)
Assessed Value, Equalized Assessed Value or Real estate taxes for three of the last
six years, have declined or remained stagnant due to the depressed condition;

(2)

There is a reasonable expectation that the development, re-development or
rehabilitation of the commercial development project is viable and likely to go
forward on a reasonably timely basis if granted Class 7c designation and will
therefore result in the economic enhancement of the property;

(3)

Certification of the commercial development project for Class 7c designation will
materially assist development, redevelopment or rehabilitation of the property and
the commercial development property would not go forward without the full
incentive offered under Class 7c; and

(4)

Certification of the commercial development project for Class 7c designation is
reasonably expected to ultimately result in an increase in real property tax revenue
and employment opportunities of the property.
b.A certified copy of the Ordinance or Resolution need not be filed at the time of
filing the Class 7c eligibility application with the Assessor, but must be filed with
the Assessor no later than the date an assessment appeal is filed to request the class

application, the applicant may instead file, at that time, a letter from the
municipality or the County, as the case may be, confirming that a Resolution or
Ordinance supporting the incentive has been requested.
c.A copy of the Resolution or letter confirming that a Resolution has been
requested, whichever is filed with the application, will be forwarded by the
Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the County Board for distribution to the
members of the County Board from the affected districts.
d.Class 7c applications for newly constructed or substantially rehabilitated
buildings and other structures must be made to the Assessor within one year prior
to the commencement of such new construction or substantial rehabilitation to
qualify for a Class 7c incentive. With respect to abandoned property, the Class 7c
application must be made to the Assessor prior to the commencement of the

with the Assessor, on or before a date determined by the Assessor, a sworn
statement verifying continuous compliance with the Class S provisions of this

to the commencement of substantial rehabilitation. After the substantial rehabilitation has
been completed, the preservation commission shall review the project to determine that it
is eligible under Subsection (14) of this Section. The applicant must supplement the
eligibility application with a copy of the determination of the preservation commission
prior to classification of the real estate as Class L.
g.The initial Class L classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the date
such substantial rehabilitation was completed and initially assessed.

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

October 26, 2016

1.The taxpayer notifies the Assessor's Office of the taxpayer's intent to request
renewal of the incentive from the municipality, or the County Board if the real
estate is located in an unincorporated area;
2.The municipality in which the real estate is located or the County Board, if the
real estate is located in an unincorporated area, adopts a resolution expressly
stating that the municipality or County Board, as the case may be, has determined
that the industrial use of the property is necessary and beneficial to the local
economy, and supports and consents to renewal of the Class L; and
3.A copy of that Resolution and a completed renewal application are filed with the
Office of the Assessor before the expiration of the incentive period.
The number of renewal periods is not limited as long as the property continues to apply
and qualify for Class L. The notice of intent to request renewal which is filed with the
Assessor's Office will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the County
Board for distribution to members of the County Board from the affected districts.
i.If, as of November 23, 1999, a property is receiving Class L treatment, but the assessment
level is higher than 16 percent, that taxpayer may apply for renewal as outlined above and
receive a 16-percent assessment level for the prescribed period beginning after the filing
and approval of the Resolution and renewal application. However, if as of the effective
date, the taxpayer's assessment is higher than 16 percent and the taxpayer is granted a
renewal of the incentive for subsequent years, no reduction of the current assessment level
based on renewal of the incentive will be granted. If no renewal is obtained, the incentive
shall be phased out over the next two years, pursuant to Section 74-64. After expiration of
the last incentive period, the real estate shall revert to the applicable classification under
this Division.
j.For commercial properties, once the original 12-year incentive period has expired, the
commercial Class L incentive will expire. The incentive classification will not be subject
to renewal and the real estate shall revert to the applicable classification under this
Division.

review of all factors relevant to determine initial and continued eligibility for the benefits
provided under Class L.
l.The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports by all

ORDINANCE
Sponsored by
THE HONORABLE JOHN A. FRITCHEY, SEAN M. MORRISON,
COUNTY COMMISSIONERS AND PRESIDENT TONI PRECKWINKLE
AN AMENDMENT TO THE COOK COUNTY AMUSEMENT TAX
WHEREAS, it is the intent of the County Board to recognize and encourage both the artists who add to
our cultural identity as well as the venues that allow them to display their talents to crowds from around the
County and around the world by exempting them from the City and County’s amusement tax for live
performances; and
WHEREAS, it is not the role of government to restrictively decide and define what is and is not ‘music’;
and
WHEREAS, to single out one or any type of music genre performed at these types of venues as not
applicable to the small venue exemption clause is not in the spirit or purpose of the exemption clause nor
the expansive definition of music;
WHEREAS, as the recording industry and music genres have evolved, the National Academy of Recording
Arts and Sciences has recognized, although sometimes more slowly than society at large, that new music
genres evolve and form, such as Rock, Rap, Reggae, Metal, Roots, Electronica, New Age etc.; and
WHEREAS, DJ’s have been considered an art form for many years now and in fact the National Academy
of Recording Arts and Sciences’ Grammy Awards created the Grammy Award for Remixer of the Year,
Non-Classical at the 40th Grammy Awards in 1998 to recognize an individual(s) who takes previously
recorded material and adds or alters it in such a way as to create a new and unique performance; and
WHEREAS, the first Grammy Award for such category was presented to Chicago’s very own Frankie
Knuckles whose key role in developing and popularizing House music into an internationally recognized
musical genre during the 1980s led to him being referred to as the "The Godfather of House Music."; and
WHEREAS, in 1998, the Cook County Board created an exemption to the Amusement Tax for small
venues with a maximum capacity of not more than 750 persons, and in 1999 the County Board further
amended said ordinance by defining live performances by examples giving several genre examples and art
forms including live musical performances, but does not restrict it to only those examples by including the
encompassing term “music”; and
WHEREAS, the current language contained in the County Code has created unintended and unnecessary
confusion as to what constitutes ‘music’ and has created undue burdens on venue operators who are being
required to comply with inconsistent definitions, restrictions and exemptions by the County and the City of
Chicago.

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

October 26, 2016

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that Chapter
74 Taxation, Article X Amusement Tax, Sections 74-391 and 74-392 of the Cook County Code of
Ordinances are hereby amended as follows:

tax imposed on the charge.
Department and Department of Revenue mean the County Department of Revenue.
Live theatrical, live musical or other live cultural performance means a live performance in any of
the disciplines which are commonly regarded as part of the fine arts, such as live theater, music, opera,

defined in Section 14.2.1 of the Cook County Zoning Ordinance).
Maximum capacity means the persons that an auditorium, theater or other space may accommodate
as determined by the local fire department or other appropriate governmental agency. If the number of

(gh) It shall be presumed that all amusements are subject to tax under this article until the contrary
is established by books, records or other documentary evidence.
(hi) It is unlawful for any person to produce, present, conduct, or resell tickets to, any amusement
without collection of the tax, except as provided in this article.

AN AMENDMENT TO THE COOK COUNTY PROCUREMENT CODE
BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that Chapter 34, FINANCE, Article
IV. - PROCURMENT CODE, Sections 34-139 and 34-140 be amended as follows:
ARTICLE IV. - PROCUREMENT CODE
Sec. 34-139. - Sole source procurements.
Procurements of supplies, equipment, goods or services may be made without use of one of the
competitive processes if there is either only one source or there is a need for the unique or specialized skill,
experience, or ability possessed by a particular source. The Using Agency must submit a letter to the CPO
justifying the sole source Procurement, and provide any other documents or information required by the
CPO. At least 15 days prior to seeking Board Action with any proposed contract, the CPO shall provide
such letter to the Board of Commissioners.
Sec. 34-140. - Comparable government procurement.
If a governmental agency has awarded a contract through a competitive method for the same or
similar supplies, equipment, goods or services as that sought by the County, the Procurement may be made
from that vendor at a price or rate at least as favorable as that obtained by that government agency without
utilizing a competitive procurement method set forth in this Procurement Code. Prior to the award of any
contract pursuant to this section, the contracting agency shall provide to the CPO a detailed summary setting
forth the justification for use of such reference contract including, but not limited to: the date, scope, subject
matter and pricing of the original contract; a summary of the bid procedures of the original contracting
authority; the basis for the County not entering its own competitive bidding process, as well as a pricing
comparison between the original contract and the proposed reference contract. At least 15 days prior to
seeking Board Action with any proposed contract, the CPO shall provide such summary to the Board of
Commissioners.
Effective Date: This Ordinance shall take effect January 1, 2017.
