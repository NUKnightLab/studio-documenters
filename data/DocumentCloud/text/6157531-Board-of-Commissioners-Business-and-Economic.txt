Article for Class 6b industrial property, Class 8 industrial property, or Class 9 multifamily
residential property. "Property tax incentive" shall not include a Class 9 designation granted to

older persons and persons with disabilities under Medicaid and which are certified by the State
Department of Public Aid pursuant to Division 2 of this Article; and Sales tax means the
Page 2 of 9

 Retailer's Occupation Tax, the Service Occupation Tax and/or the Use Tax.
(a)(b) Living wage requirement.

(1) Unless expressly waived by the County Board, any Employer occupying a property that
receives a property tax incentive for Class 6b industrial property, Class 8 industrial property,
or Class 9 multifamily residential property shall pay not less than the Living Wage, as defined
in the Cook County Procurement Code (Cook County, Ill., Code, Ch. 34, Art. IV, Div. 1 § 34121), to each of its onsite Employees, unless such Employees' Wages are governed by
Federal or State prevailing wage law. For purpose of this Section, the term "Employee" shall
mean an Employee who performs duties or services for an Employer on average at least 30
hours per week in any two-week period for which the Employee is paid; "hours per week"
shall mean hours for which an Employee is paid or entitled to payment by the Employer for a
period of time during which no duties are performed by the Employee due to vacation, holiday,
illness, incapacity, jury duty, military duty or approved leave of absence.
(2) On and after July 1, 2020, the owner of any property that receives a property tax incentive
shall notify all Employers who occupy such property as lessees of the requirements of this
Section. Upon commencement of a lease, on or after July 1, 2020, of a property that receives
a property tax incentive, any new lessee shall be required to submit to the municipality or the
Cook County Board, as the case may be, an affidavit stating that such lessee is paying a
Living Wage to its Employees in compliance with this Section. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, the requirements of this Section shall not apply to an Employer who is
a lessee and not an owner-occupant of a property that receives a Class 8 industrial property
tax incentive or an Employer who was a lessee and not an owner-occupant of a property that
receives a property tax incentive prior to July 1, 2020.
(3) This Section shall not apply to Employers that are not-for-profit organizations or funded by
Federal grants or Federal loans or Employers who are lessees but are not owners of a
property that receives a property tax incentive prior to adoption of this amended Ordinance.
Further, this Section shall not apply to Employers who can demonstrate to the County Board
that compliance with the requirements of this Section would cause such Employer to be in
violation of the terms of a collective bargaining agreement between the Employer and a labor
union.
(4) Every Employer required to pay the Living Wage shall notify its Employees of the Living
Wage requirements and shall notify all of its Employees annually of any adjustment to the
Living Wage. In addition, the Employer shall notify its Employees that if any Employee
contends that the Employer is not paying a Living Wage or has otherwise violated this section,
that Employee may file a complaint with the Cook County Commissioner on Human Rights
("Commission"). The Commissioner shall investigate alleged violations of the Living Wage
Ordinance and is authorized to adopt regulations for the proper administration and
enforcement of its provisions. If at the conclusion of the Commission's investigation, the
Commission finds that the Employer has violated this section, it shall (i) in the case of an
Employer receiving a property tax incentive, notify the Assessor and the municipality, or the
County, as the case may be; or (ii) in the case of a Contractor or a subcontractor required to
Page 3 of 9

 pay the Living Wage, notify the Chief Procurement Officer, who shall exercise such remedies
as are in the best interest of the County, including ordering the Employer to pay back pay and
penalties, as provided in this section.
(5) If an Employer is found to be in violation of this section, such Employer may be required to
pay back pay to each affected Employee, and may also be fined by the County up to $100.00
for each affected Employee for each day paid at less than the Living Wage. Such penalties
will not be imposed on any Person except after a hearing (Cook County, Ill., Code, Ch. 2, Art.
IX). Further, if an Employer is found to be in violation of this section, the property tax
incentive for this property is subject to revocation.
(6) If an Employer is found to have retaliated against an affected Employee, the Employer's
property tax incentive may be terminated unless such Employer appropriately reinstates or
compensates such Employee.
(7) For the purposes of this Section:
Property tax incentive means a reduction in the assessment level as set forth in Division 2 of this
Article for Class 6b industrial property, Class 8 industrial property, or Class 9 multifamily
residential property. "Property tax incentive" shall not include a Class 9 designation granted to
supportive living facilities, which establish an alternative to nursing home care for low income
older persons and persons with disabilities under Medicaid and which are certified by the State
Department of Public Aid pursuant to Division 2 of this Article; and Sales tax means the
Retailer's Occupation Tax, the Service Occupation Tax and/or the Use Tax.
(8)(7) Living Wage Affidavit. Every municipality or the Cook County Board that provides a
Resolution or Ordinance or authorized officer letter, as the case may be, to an applicant for
a Class 6b industrial property or a Class 8 industrial property tax incentive shall maintain in
its files and records documentation that such municipality or the County Board received
and filed the Living Wage Affidavit submitted by the applicantowner or lessee of such
property stating that such applicantowner or lessee is paying a Living Wage to its
Employees in compliance with this Section. Further, an applicant or lessee of a Class 9
multifamily residential property tax incentive shall provide the municipality or the Cook
County Board, as the case may be, a Living Wage Affidavit which shall be maintained by
such municipality or the Cook County Board in its files and records. For purposes of clarity
and notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Employers who are lessees and not
owner-occupants shall not be required to comply with the requirements of this paragraph
until on or after July 1, 2020. Further, the requirements of this paragraph shall not be
applicable to a lessee of a property that receives a Class 8 industrial property tax incentive.
