**Report from System Human Resources Department (Attachment #1)
A. Report from Interim Director of Human Resources
Gladys Lopez, System Interim Director of Human Resources, provided an update on the following subjects: 2012
Year End Vacancies Filled; 2013 Vacancies Filled; CCHHS Hiring Snapshot as of 12/5/12 and 1/15/13;
Recruiting/Sourcing Update; update on Taleo; and update on other Human Resources Initiatives.
Included in the update on other Human Resources Initiatives was information on the following subjects: 2013
House Staff; Electronic Scheduling; Shakman Training; Employment Plan; Workplace Violence Training; and
Assessment of Contracted Staff on Site. The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
Board Chairman Carvalho provided information regarding an issue involving a professional regulation licensing
problem with respect to residents. The State laid off all of the people who process these applications
approximately two weeks ago; this was due to a dispute with the Medical Society over the collection of the
physician license fees that support the program. He stated the problem has to be solved; no residents in the State
of Illinois can start work on July 1st unless they have been processed by this remaining single individual, who
cannot possibly process them all. Additionally, all of the physicians who are up for renewal a year from June
have to be processed by this single individual, as well. It will be fixed, but he recommended that staff may want
to monitor the issue. Ms. Lopez stated that Dr. John O’Brien, System Chair of Planning, Education and Research,
is monitoring the issue; he will provide feedback on the issue when it is resolved.
