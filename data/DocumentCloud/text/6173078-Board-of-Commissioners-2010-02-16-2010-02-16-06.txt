EXPLANATION
The proposed resolution is to approve the TSP, Lease, and Lease Rider, and bylaws to be used for
Rockwell Gardens replacement housing units at West End Phase 2. The 112 units, including 65
designated for public housing, 33 as affordable housing, and 14 as market rate units, will be
operated by the private developer. Priority will be given to previous residents of Rockwell Gardens
as determined by the Housing Offer Process. It is understood that the developer has an interest and
desire to implement its own lease forms and policy that encourages consistent community
standards for the effective management of its development.
The property specific requirements for applicants contained in the attached ACOP are based on the
CHA’s Minimum TSP (Board approved September 21, 2004).
The authorization of approval of the TSP, Lease, and Lease Rider, and bylaws to be used for the
public housing replacement housing units at West End Phase 2 is required at this time to facilitate
the development of these units. These documents have been reviewed by CHA, the Developer,
Working Group, and Resident Leadership representing the interest of residents from Rockwell
Gardens, who recommend the documents as acceptable. A public comment period was held from
December 9, 2009 through January 7, 2010. A public comment hearing was held on December
16, 2009 at Grant School Campus. Due to low resident turnout, it was requested that CHA host
another hearing. A town hall meeting was held on January 23, 2010 at Grant School Campus. The
comment period was extended and the CHA accepted comments until January 25, 2010. Notice
for the 30-day comment period was published in the Chicago Sun-Times, Chicago Defender, and
Extra newspapers, as well as posted on the CHA website and on site at the following Office(s):
CHA Administrative Office, Central Advisory Council, and West End Management Office.
Consideration was given to any forthcoming comments prior to finalizing the documents.
