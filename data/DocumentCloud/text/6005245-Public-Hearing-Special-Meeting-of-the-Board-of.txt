ABOUT THE

COOK COUNTY HEALTH & HOSPITALS SYSTEM
The Cook County Health & Hospitals System (CCHHS)
is one of the largest public health care systems in
the United States, providing a range of health care
services regardless of a patient’s ability to pay.
CCHHS serves approximately 300,000 unique patients
annually through more than 1 million outpatient visits
and more than 20,000 inpatient hospital admissions.
The System operates:

The System’s hospitals and ambulatory network are Joint
Commission accredited. Stroger Hospital also holds
certifications in stroke, burn, perinatal and oncology
care. CCHHS’ Primary Care Medical Home model is
also Joint Commission accredited.
The Cook County Department of Public Health (CCDPH)
serves 2.5 million residents in 124 municipalities
and serves the public health needs of its jurisdiction
through effective and efficient disease prevention and
health promotion programs. CCDPH’s approach to
protecting and promoting health brings residents,
partners and resources together to address issues
facing the communities it serves. The department
is responsible for the prevention of the spread of
nearly 70 reportable communicable diseases and the
enforcement of Cook County and Illinois public health
laws, rules and regulations.

state of Illinois Medicaid agency to early-enroll eligible
low-income Cook County adults (ACA adults) into a
Medicaid managed care program. Many of CountyCare’s

ABOUT

IMPACT 2020
The 2017-2019 strategic planning process began in early 2016 with an analysis of Vision 2015, the
five-year strategic plan that was adopted by the Cook County Health & Hospitals System (CCHHS)
Board of Directors in 2010. CCHHS has made significant progress in the last five years toward the
achievement of the goals detailed in Vision 2015. These achievements can be found in the Appendix.
The following mission and vision statements were adopted in Vision 2015 and continue to reflect
CCHHS’ philosophy today.

MISSION
To deliver integrated health services with dignity and respect
regardless of a patient’s ability to pay; foster partnerships with
other health providers and communities to enhance the health of
the public; and advocate for policies which promote and protect the
physical, mental and social well-being of the people of Cook County.

VISION
In support of its public health mission, CCHHS will be recognized
locally, regionally and nationally – and by patients and employees – as
progressively evolving model for an accessible, integrated, patient-centered
and fiscally-responsible health care system focused on assuring highquality care and improving the health of the residents of Cook County.

PRINCIPLES
At the outset of Impact 2020, the System offered the following goal for its three-year strategic plan based on CCHHS’
vision and developed five principles that would guide the creation and execution of the plan: to build a high-quality
safe, reliable, patient-centered, integrated health system that maximizes resources to ensure the greatest benefit for the
patients and communities we serve.
These five principles, outlined below, challenge CCHHS to step out of its historical role to transform into a modern,
integrated health system leveraging all of its component parts to lead in the provision of high-quality health care
and the elimination of health disparities throughout Cook County.
Improve health equity
Health equity is achieved when every person has the opportunity to attain his or her full health potential
and no one is disadvantaged from achieving this potential because of social position or other socially
determined circumstances.1
Provide high quality, safe, reliable care
The quality of patient care is determined by the quality of infrastructure, training, competence of personnel
and efficiency of operational systems.2 The fundamental requirement is the adoption of a system that is
‘patient centered’ and the implementation of highly reliable processes.
Maximize financial sustainability and demonstrate value
Transformation requires significant focus on financial management to ensure that limited resources are expended
in accord with the strategic priorities. Ensuring and measuring the value of CCHHS programs and services
against appropriate industry standards will be critical for CCHHS to thrive in a competitive environment.
Develop the workforce
CCHHS’ 6,700+ employees are its biggest asset. Building employees’ skills through education and
development opportunities focused on improving efficiency and quality of care, as well as staff
and patient satisfaction will serve as the basis for all of its work.
Lead in medical education, clinical investigation and research relevant to vulnerable populations
Cook County has a rich history of medical training and top-notch clinical research, particularly for
vulnerable populations. This legacy is an important component to maintain the System’s
workforce pipeline and develop effective innovations in care.
These five principles reflect the System’s unique market position as a public safety net system with a rich history of
providing quality patient care to vulnerable populations as well as significant contributions to medical training and
clinical investigation. Impact 2020 recognizes that CCHHS must work closely with the larger community, including but
not limited to health care, social services, government and community groups to develop solutions to address the social
determinants that disproportionately impact the populations CCHHS serves.

 D RAFT
With further consolidation expected in the health
care delivery and insurance sectors, national
elections looming and a state in fiscal crisis,
external forces will require CCHHS to remain
nimble to achieve its ambitious goals. While
data does not yet exist, estimates suggest and
logic dictates that the ACA and Medicaid expansion
will reduce uncompensated care provided by private
hospitals. And while CCHHS saw an initial decline,
uncompensated care is on the rise in 2016 - the result
of either increased referrals of uninsured patients
from other hospitals or the reality that many who hold
marketplace plans simply cannot afford them.

The ACA has created competition for many of CCHHS’
patients, requiring additional investments and initiatives
by CCHHS. Improving the patient experience is
imperative for CCHHS. As a majority of CCHHS’ patients
now have choice in where to seek care in today’s postACA environment, CCHHS must provide many of the
same services, conveniences and amenities available at
competing health systems.

The System has recently made great strides
to enhance the delivery of care and patient
experience, such as:

CCHHS is one of the few health systems in the country
that has all of the component parts for success under
one umbrella. The opportunity this presents for strategic
integration and impact is immense and should be
capitalized on for the benefit of the communities and
patients CCHHS serves. Leveraging and integrating all
of CCHHS’ assets in an intentional manner will generate
meaningful and actionable plans and position CCHHS
as a health care leader both locally and nationally. It
will also help enable CCHHS to achieve the Institute of
Healthcare Improvement’s Triple Aim to improve the
patient experience and the health of populations, while

 D RAFT
provide opportunities for CCHHS to implement process
improvement strategies that will continuously raise the
quality bar.
The game changer in patient care will come from the
comprehensive implementation of care management
across all of CCHHS’ patient populations. The CCHHS
care management model has explicit goals: improve
patient outcomes, engage physicians and medical home
teams and improve patient satisfaction.
CCHHS has built a care management infrastructure
that is now managing more than 90,000 CountyCare
members, connecting them with appropriate care. Care
managers seek to assist patients in managing their
health, navigating the delivery system, linking to social
services and reducing barriers – all contributors to higher
quality care. Risk screenings implemented reliably across
the System will not only drive individual care plans but
also allow CCHHS to analyze and develop strategies that
can improve population health. CCHHS believes that
care management at the provider-level differentiates
CCHHS as a provider and CountyCare as a plan, from
the competition and will go a long way toward achieving
the objectives of the Triple Aim.

FOCUS AREA 1:
Deliver High
Quality Care

The System’s Joint Commission certified Primary Care
Medical Home (PCMH) model standardizes the delivery
of primary care services within its community-based
health centers. Each center now has the skills and
resources to effectively manage its ‘panel’ of primary
care patients using a team-based approach. The PCMH
model coupled with planned capital investments in
health facilities will ensure that CCHHS’ health centers
are providing patient- and family-centered care in a
modern, environment akin to the Federally Qualified
Health Centers (FQHCs) who have enjoyed access to
significant federal funds to rebuild and/or renovate

While CCHHS has long focused its attention on
providing excellent acute care in hospitals, the new
health care environment provides immense opportunity
for CCHHS to strengthen delivery of its outpatient
services – primary care, specialty care, diagnostics,
therapeutic, dental, behavioral health and pharmacy –
to prevent unnecessary hospitalizations and reserving
inpatient services when only medically indicated.
As CCHHS moves toward a fully integrated system,
greater standardization of evidence-based practices at
every stage in the care continuum will result in highly
reliable care and better outcomes for patients. The
ability to measure practices and outcomes against
national standards and other health systems will

facilities and providing access to a comprehensive
portfolio of outpatient primary and specialty care as well
as diagnostic and therapeutic services will also allow
CCHHS to attract new patients and grow volumes.

Cerner platform designed to scale at a population
level while facilitating health and care at a person and
provider level. This cloud-based platform enables health
care systems to aggregate, transform and reconcile
data across the continuum of care. A longitudinal record
is established, through that process, for individual
members of the population that the organization is

the Health Center Consolidation Act (Section 330 of
the Public Health Service Act).

Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) – An
organization interposed between providers and payers
that attempts to “manage the care” on behalf of the

Medicaid – A state and federal program that provides
health coverage for those with very low income.
Medicaid Managed Care – Services provided through
an arrangement between a state Medicaid agency and

pays the MCO a monthly premium to cover the services
provided to a beneficiary. There are two main forms
of Medicaid managed care, “risk-based MCOs” and
“primary care case management (PCCM).” In a riskbased MCO system, the State pays a flat per-memberper-month rate and the MCO pays for health care
services rendered to the member. In a PCCM system, the
State pays for services on a fee-for-service basis as well
as a monthly fee to a contracted primary care provider to
coordinate care for the beneficiary.

Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) –

“empaneled” with them. The PMPM remains the
same for an individual whether they receive no health
care services in a month, or very intensive health care
services.

which government jobs are given to supporters of a
politician or party, and government employees may be
fired for not supporting a favored candidate or party.

Uncompensated Care – Health care or services
provided by hospitals or health care providers that are
not reimbursed from the patient or from third-party
payers. Often uncompensated care arises when people
are uninsured or underinsured and cannot afford to pay
the cost of care. Some costs for these services may be
covered through cost shifting.

Six Sigma – A process-improvement methodology
that relies on a collaborative team effort to improve
performance by systematically removing waste.

Underinsured – People with public or private insurance

and are identified by the Illinois Department of Public
Health by “Level” designation: Level-I (Level-1) being
the highest, to Level-III (Level-3) being the lowest (some
states have five designated levels, in which case Level-V
(Level-5) is the lowest). Stroger Hospital is home to the
busiest Level-I trauma center in Illinois and one of the
busiest in the nation.
