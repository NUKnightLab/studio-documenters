EXPLANATION
The Chicago Housing Authority’s Plan for Transformation represents a new beginning for public
housing in Chicago. The CHA has partnered with CCC since 2005 to establish education and
training programs for CHA residents and former CHA residents who have temporarily relocated
to the private market with a Housing Choice Voucher. The goal of the IGA has been to support
self-sufficiency for families by creating a continuum of education and training opportunities that
allow CHA residents to advance over time to progressively higher levels of education, and obtain
certification and employment that should ultimately result in better paying careers in areas of
economic importance.
Under the IGA, existing degree and certification programs have continued to be made available
to CHA residents at no cost in a variety of industries. In addition, customized bridge programs

 have enabled residents needing more extensive educational support to move towards entry into
degree and certification programs or directly to employment. City Colleges provides staff
dedicated to support residents as they attend educational programs. They also provide assistance
with navigating CCC’s enrollment procedures, help with decision making about educational and
employment tracks and ensure continued attendance in CCC’s educational programs through
tutoring and retention services. In 2011, the IGA will continue to provide for the delivery of
educational services to CHA residents at a variety of educational levels as well as to provide
support while residents are engaged in educational activities.
CCC’s staff dedication and CHA participants’ desire to achieve self-sufficiency is demonstrated
by 2010 program outcomes. As of October 2010, 206 residents have completed a
degree/certificate program, an additional 81 are currently enrolled and another 14 are waiting for
their programs to begin. In addition, 87% of program registrants have completed or still remain
in their degree/certificate program, a 4% increase in retention from 2009. CCC staff have
conducted educational sessions with CHA case management providers (e.g. FamilyWorks), and
over 475 residents have attended an orientation.
Based on the foregoing, it is in the best interest of the CHA to authorize the Chief Executive
Officer, or his designee, to enter into an IGA with the City Colleges of Chicago for the period of
January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2011 in an amount not-to-exceed $1,000,000.
