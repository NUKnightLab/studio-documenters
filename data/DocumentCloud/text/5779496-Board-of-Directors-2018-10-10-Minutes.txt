The Detroit Brownfield Redevelopment Authority (the “DBRA”) had determined that the process for
authorizing expenditures for the DBRA was in need of further streamlining.
Any two Officers or any one Officer and any one Authorized Agent shall have the power to review and
approve expenditures in an amount up to and including the sum of $50,000.00, plus an amount not to
exceed 25 percent of the original contract amount for change orders, if necessary.

 Upon such approval, the officers and Authorized Agents would be authorized to negotiate and execute any
and all documents and other writings necessary to implement the authorized expenditure, the execution of
which would be in a manner consistent with the previous resolutions adopted by the DBRA Board.
DBRA staff would also report in writing to the Board on a quarterly basis regarding all expenditures
authorized during that month.
Ms. McClain asked if the Delegation of Authority would need to be renewed annually or only approved
once. Ms. Kanalos stated that the Delegation of Authority would only need to be approved by the DBRA
Board once.
Ms. McClain asked why the DBRA Delegation of Authority was not the same as the Delegation of Authority
for the other Authorities administered by DEGC for the City of Detroit. Ms. Kanalos stated that when the
Delegation of Authority was presented to the DBRA Board in 2013, there was a DBRA Board member that
wanted to reduce the expenditure authorization amount from $50,000 to $25,000.

Authorized Agent for the DBRA.

PROJECTS
AMC Site – 14250 Plymouth Road – Expansion of Scope: Environmental Assessment/Second Party
Review & Geotechnical Site Assessment Services Contract
Mr. Dailey presented the contract for the Environmental Assessment/Second Party Review & Geotechnical
Site Assessment Services for the AMC Site.
On behalf of the City of Detroit, the DBRA is evaluating the former AMC Site located at 14250 Plymouth
Road for Environmental and Geotechnical Due Diligence in connection with the DDOT and Wayne County
Land Bank swap agreement and for attracting industrial facility developments to the Project.
PROJECT SCOPE
On December 20, 2017 the DBRA conducted an initial solicitation for the submission of competitive
proposals for the provision of Site Assessment Services associated with the DBRA’s Pre-development Site
Preparation Activities of the AMC via a Request for Proposals.
The DBRA approved a contract with Testing Engineers & Consultants, Inc (TEC) on January 19, 2018 in
the amount of $136,000, which also included a 20% contingency and was largely due to the unknown
contamination at the site, to provide the following services on the site:
•
•
•
•
•

Phase 1 Environmental Site Assessment
Stock piled (non-native) soil, testing & characterizing soils for contaminants
Gridding sampling, testing & characterizing of native ground soils for contaminants
Geotechnical investigation
Hazardous material survey of existing facilities

EXPANSION OF SCOPE

 Due to the complexities of the site, including the significant costs associated with assessing and disposing
of the soil stockpiles, and as a follow up to TEC’s Evaluation, the City has requested a second party
assessment. This second party review includes the assessment of TEC’s report as it relates to sufficiency
and identification of data gaps from the soil stockpile samples and geotechnical investigation. In addition,
the City has expanded the project area to include assessments of property adjacent to the east and west
of the site.
Second Party Contractor Selected: DBRA staff proposes the selection of Soil & Materials Engineers, Inc.
(SME) as the second party contractor to perform the services associated with the expanded scope of
services due to their multidisciplinary project team approach and responsiveness to the expanded scope
of services at the AMC Site. Details of the expanded scope and fees are below:
SCHEDULE AND PROFESSIONAL FEES
Second Party Assessment Review, Site Visit, Stockpile Test Pits and Survey
Contingency
Total Board Approved Amount

$50,000
$25,000
$75,000

Mr. George asked how much the first environmental assessments for the AMC Site cost. Mr. Dailey stated
that the first contract for environmental assessments for the AMC Site was $136,000.
Mr. George asked if the contract for the second party assessment review was going to be $50,000-75,000.
Mr. Dailey confirmed that the contract for the second party assessment review was going to be $50,00075,000 which will include the same scope as the first review but will have extended boundaries.
Mr. George asked if the City of Detroit was requesting the contract for the second party assessment review.
Mr. Dailey confirmed that the City of Detroit has requested the contract for the second party assessment
review to get a second opinion on the $12-14 million cost estimate to remove the stockpiled soil on the
AMC Site.
Ms. DeSantis asked if the DBRA has procured SME through the City of Detroit’s procurement process. Mr.
Dailey stated that SME was selected based upon recommendations, SME’s background and based on the
timing requirements for the AMC Site. Ms. DeSantis asked if this was a bid process that the City of Detroit
would normally conduct. Mr. Dailey stated that it was not a bid process conducted by the City.
Ms. DeSantis asked why there are timing requirements for the AMC Site. Mr. Walters stated that the City
of Detroit has to inform Wayne County by November 1, 2018 if the City of Detroit would like to accept
ownership of the AMC Site as part of the land swap for the new criminal justice complex and the City of
Detroit needs large areas of acreage for employment opportunities and needs to decide if the City of Detroit
wants to accept land that has significant cleanup costs.
Ms. DeSantis asked if the DBRA received the results of the environmental assessments from TEC months
ago, why is the DBRA asking for a second opinion now and not earlier in the process. Mr. Dailey stated that
the City of Detroit and the DEGC attempted to find additional sources of funding available to assist with the
cleanup costs for the AMC Site, and now would like to seek a second assessment.
Ms. Wilkins asked if the DBRA anticipates receiving different results in the second environmental
assessment from SME. Mr. Dailey stated that different results are not expected from the assessment to be
performed by SME, but the assessment boundaries have been expanded in order to seek additional
solutions for the cleanup of the AMC Site.
Ms. Wilkins stated that she remembers when the AMC Site was first presented to the DBRA Board and she
had concerns about it and would like the Site to be cleaned up for the surrounding community.
Ms. Kanalos stated that any further actions taken after the second assessment that would come through
the DBRA would be presented to the DBRA Board for approval before moving forward.

 Ms. Washington asked if we get the assessment back from SME and there aren’t any other viable solutions
to the environmental cleanup issues, what will the City of Detroit move forward. Ms. Kanalos stated that the
City of Detroit would then have to decide if they would like to accept the land from Wayne County.
Mr. Walters called for approval of the resolution approving the AMC Site – 14250 Plymouth Road –
Expansion of Scope: Environmental Assessment/Second Party Review & Geotechnical Site Assessment
Services Contract. The Board took the following action:
On a motion by Ms. Wilkins, seconded by Mr. George, DBRA Resolution Code 18-10-254-03 was
unanimously approved.

Agreement
Mr. Vosburg presented the Reimbursement Agreement for the Second Amended and Restated Garfield
Area Brownfield Redevelopment Plan to the DBRA Board. Mr. Vosburg stated that Sonya Mays has
disclosed to the DBRA Board her position as President and CEO of Develop Detroit at past DBRA Board
meetings when the Second Amended and Restated Garfield Area Brownfield Redevelopment Plan was
presented to the DBRA Board.
On July 25, 2018, the Detroit Brownfield Redevelopment Authority (the “DBRA”) Board of Directors
recommended approval to City Council of the Brownfield Plan for the Second Amended and Restated
Garfield Area Redevelopment Project (the “Plan”) which was subsequently approved by Detroit City Council
on September 11, 2018. A requirement for Tax Increment Financing reimbursement pursuant to the Plan
is that a Reimbursement Agreement (the “Agreement”) be entered into between the DBRA, Develop Detroit,
Inc., 71 Garfield, LLC and Midtown Detroit, Inc. (the “Developers”). The Agreement has been prepared

Project Introduction
This Plan is intended to replace the brownfield plan for the Garfield Area Redevelopment Project that was
approved on October 18, 2006 (hereinafter referred to as the "2006 Plan") and that was first amended and
restated on November 1, 2011 (hereinafter referred to as the “2011 Amendment”). Changes are noted
within the individual project descriptions. The Plan includes multiple projects, each to be developed by
different developers (referred to generally throughout this Plan as the “Developer”). The developers have
agreed that each of the projects benefit the others, and as such, agree to cooperate with one another to
implement this Plan and any future agreements to be executed pursuant to this Plan.
Develop Detroit Inc. and Preservation of Affordable Housing Inc. were selected by the City of Detroit as the
developers of four (4) City owned parcels that are part of the Plan. The second (2nd) amendment and
restatement of the Garfield Area Brownfield Plan is being requested to include the new developers in the
Brownfield Plan and to modify the following aspects of the 2011 Plan: scope of Project, Eligible Activities,
TIF Table, and Eligible Investment that was included in the original approvals.
In the 2006 Plan, the projects were as follows:
• Garfield Manor and York Apartments
• E. Forest Art Project
• Randora Apartments
• Parking Deck I
• Parking Deck II
In the 2011 Amendment, changes to the Plan included:
• Updating the TIF eligible public improvements
• Splitting the Garfield Manor and York Apartments development into two separate projects
• Updating the status of the E. Forest Art Project
• Removing the eligible MBT investment in the Randora apartment project.

 •
•
•
•

Updating the plans for the Parking Deck I project
Removing the eligible activities from Parking Deck II
Adding 76 E. Forest
Adding 92 E. Forest

In this 2nd Amendment & Restatement, proposed changes to the Plan include:
• Amending the project description to change what was known as the Parking Deck I project
to the Sugar Hill Redevelopment project.
• Amending and restating the eligible activities associated with the Sugar Hill
Redevelopment project
• Amending and restating the TIF Tables to add the Sugar Hill Redevelopment project.
• Identifying investment in the Sugar Hill Redevelopment project as Eligible Investment
associated with a Michigan Business Tax (MBT) credit, which is to be amended.
These changes are described in more detail in the individual project descriptions. Each Project includes
eligible activities and eligible properties and will request, has already requested, or has already received
a MBT credit.
Total investment for the Sugar Hill Redevelopment Project is expected to be approximately
$34,600,000.00. The Developers are requesting $9,639,944.00 in TIF reimbursement under the proposed
Plan.
Property Subject to the Plan
