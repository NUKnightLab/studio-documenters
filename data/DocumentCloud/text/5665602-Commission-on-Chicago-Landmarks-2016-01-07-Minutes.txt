1. 2118 W. Evergreen
2nd Ward
Wicker Park District
Proposed new 2½-story single-family frame house with a 3-car rear detached garage.
Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:

1. Given the variety of historic building types, scales, and siting of this particular

front yard setback, as shown on drawings dated 12/24/15 is approved as
proposed;
2. The windows shall be wood or clad-wood double-hung windows with muntins

siding shall have a 4” exposed lap with a smooth texture to be consistent with
historic wood siding. Enlarged window, cornice, trim, porch, stair, and siding
details shall be included in the permit plans; and,
3. Considering that the brick at the base will be a standard sized brick, similar in
scale to historic brick bases, that dark color tones are found within the district,

conceptually approved with a non-reflective finish, with Historic Preservation
