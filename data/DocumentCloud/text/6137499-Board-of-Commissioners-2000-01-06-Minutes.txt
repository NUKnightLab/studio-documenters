Court Reporter: Tony L isanti, C.S. R.
Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Audit Committee of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County met pursuant to notice on
Tuesday, October 26, 1999 at the hour of 10:30 AM in the Board Room, Room 569, County Building,
118 North C lark Street, Chicago, Illinois.
Your Comm ittee has considered the following items and upon adoption of this repo11, the
recommendations are as follows:
Following the Call of the meeting, Chairma n Daley stated that questions had been submitted to various
departments and e lected officials on the agenda items. The C hairman requested copies of the responses
and questions be submitted to the Secretary to the Board and placed in the record as attachments to the
Committee's report. (The referenced documents are on file in the Office of the County C lerk.)
The Chairman then proceeded to the first item on the agenda.
1.

Office of the Public Guardian - Financial Report for the year ended November 30, 1997, by
Laura A. Burman, County Auditor.
Submitted to the Audit Committee on May 13, 1999. Deferred at the July 29, 1999 meeting.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JANUARY 6, 2000
The Chairman then proceeded to the second item on the agenda.

2.

Fixed Asset Inventory Control Review, by Laura A. Burman, County Auditor, dated March
31, 1999.
Deferred at the July 29, 1999 meeting.

Commissioner Hansen requested that his questions submitted to the County Auditor and the response
from Laura Burman be submitted for the record.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question regarding why the county does not depreciate its assets,
Tom Glaser stated that under a new rule by the Government Accounting Standards Board (GASB 34,
with an effective implementation date of November 30, 2002), the county will be reporting in a ll financial
statements depreciation on all assets.
Tom Glaser noted that one of the Bureau of Finance's performance measurements in the FY 2000 Budget
addresses the GASB 34 rule in regards to what is needed to prepare the county to begin tracking
depreciation levels and enable the county to be in compliance by the 2002 implementation date.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question regarding if the county can determine depreciation
relative to estimates of useful life or is the county limited under the new GASB rule, Tom Glaser stated
that prior to the implementation date the county is not limited and will have significant flexibility in
determining the county's asset base. He stated that the asset depreciation system the county would
implement after November 30, 2002 would most likely use Internal Revenue Service (IRS) guidelines and
regulations to recommend what is best for the county. However, Mr. Glaser stressed that the details of
the new GASB No. 34 rule and its possible limits on the county were still under review.
Commissioner Hansen req uested that Tom Glaser keep the committee informed on the impact of the new
GASB 34 rule on the county's asset depreciation system.
In response to Commissioner Butler's question regarding the county's policy and procedure for the
disposal of county equipment, Cathy Maras stated that when an office needs to dispose or move county
property they are required to contact the Department of Central Services. She stated that once the
department is notified, it comes out to record the county identification number in order for it to be
removed from the office's inventory list and tracked to a storage facility , new office placement or
salvaged. Cathy Maras noted that when county assets are salvaged, Central Services goes out to bid on
purchase of the assets (accepting three bids), the bid of the highest dollar amount is chosen, and the
monies collected are put in the county's genera l fund.

DEPOSITORY ACCOUNTS AS OF FEBRUARY 28, 1999

T AXPAYER'S INTEREST ASSURANCE ORDINANCE. As you know, the Taxpayer's
lnterest Assurance Ordinance requires that the opening of any depository accounts be
reported to the Chief Financial Officer a nd the County Auditor within seven days of the
opening of the account. Attached find information prepared by the Office of the C hief
Financial Officer on depository relationships, by department, existing as of Febr uary 28,
1999.
Referred to the Audit Committee on September 22, 1999.
In response to Commissioner Lechowicz's question regarding what office and individual is responsible for
monitoring the intent and purpose of the Taxpayer's Interest Assurance Ordinance, Tom G laser stated that
the ordinance does not clearly define the office responsible for e nforcing the ordinance, specify between
interest bearing and non-interest bearing accounts, or directly assign the minimum level of interest that
should be obtained o n a ll accounts. However, he noted the ordinance does require that a ll new accounts
be reported to the Chief Financial Officer and the Auditor, and that the Auditor reviews interest earned on
accounts as part of office audits.
In response to Vice Chairman Goslin's question regarding if the county had a written investment policy
that sets criteria on the rate of investment of county fund s, Torn G laser stated that he was not awa re of
any spec ific written po licy beyond the State criteria the county follows which sets the guaranty at 110
percent of current market value for col lateralization of the money invested.
In response to Vice C hairman Goslin's question regarding if there was any criteria for selecting
institutions, such as the institution being located in Cook County, Torn Glaser stated that he was not
aware of any location criteria for bank accounts or investments.
Vice Chairman Goslin suggested that the county look into establishing some general account and
investment criteria for all public funds its departments and officials hold and invest.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JANUARY 6, 2000
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question regarding if it would be possible to show an annualized
balance and an annualized percent of earnings on the items in the report, Tom Glaser stated that he would
look into making this change and improving the format of the report.
Commissioner Lechowicz requested a letter be sent from the Chairman to respective public officials,
which the report shows have accounts earning no interest, and ask for the number of accounts they hold
with no interest and a response explaining why.
Commissioner Lechowicz requested that the Chief Financial Officer and Auditor prepare and submit to
the Chairman recommendations to improve the ordinance in regards to establishing a criteria for
investment, by setting a threshold or minimum interest rate level, and procedures to monitor the policy ,
by specifying the office that would have direct oversight and the responsibility to enforce the ordinance.

Commissioner Lechowicz moved to receive and file Item 3 - Communication 231045. Seconded by

DEPARTMENT OF RISK MANAGEMENT, by Stephen A. Hill, Director,

transmitting a Communication, dated September 7, 1999:
I am hereby transmitting the PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Actuarial Review of the
Workers' Compensation and Liability Self-Insured Programs for the fiscal year ending
November 30, 1998 for your review and consideration.
Referred to the Audit Committee on September 9, 1999.

In response to Commissioner Hansen's question, on pages 3 and 7, regarding if a five-year trend on
reserve requirements and on expenditures to meet the types of liabilities that are aggregated was available
for review, Laura Burman stated that she had passed the Commissioner's questions and req uest for
information to Stephen Hill, Director of Risk Management, in the Bureau of Finance.
Stephen Hill stated that PricewaterhouseCoopers was working on the requested information on the fiveyear trend on reserves. Mr. Hill noted that page 7 of the report did show a five-year spread of the claims
and the expected total payouts.

372

 JOURN AL O F PROCEE DINGS FOR JAN UARY 6, 2000
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question regarding what amount of reserve do llars have been
placed in the year 2000 budget, T o m G laser stated $55 million in reserves have been put in next year's
budget fo r payouts.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question regarding how the actual pay ments in the past years
re lates to the summary of the loss reserves on a proportionate bas is, Terry O'Brien, with
PricewaterhouseCoopers, stated that the loss reserve is develo ped based on both the county's historical
pay ments and case reserves (which are reserves set up by adjusters and attorneys based on the individual
claim information). He noted that it is an aggregate of all known claims.
In response to Commissione r Hansen's question, on page 8, regarding if the estimated $40 million
projected pay me nts versus the actual $35 million loss in fi scal year ' 98 was an ave rage variance, Terry
O'Brien stated that is was a reasonable va riance given the amo unt of exposure the county has and the fact
that the county has no cap on any individual loss. Mr. O'Brien noted that most insurance companies and
self- insurers have some sort of excess insurance that caps the individual's c la im amount that can be paid
at any one time. If this were the case the contributions to the county's an nual payments, from any
indiv idual c laim, would be quite a bit less than w hat the potential Joss is currently.
In response to Commiss ione r Hansen's question regarding whether the county had done an analysis of its
current risk in terms of insurance premium levels, max imum payout pe r incide nt, T om G laser stated that
the Risk Management Department has looked at buy ing levels of excess insurance and the possibility of
the county assuming a smaller share of the risk as part o f the self-ins urance program. He noted, however,
that the program is in the process of being developed and a recommendation had not yet been submitted.
O n the same subject, Stephen Hill spoke on the ana lys is Commissio ner Hansen had inquired about. He
stated the analysis appears on page 14 of the actuarial review and shows an across-the-board presentation
of the County's total liability exposure in terms of the budget and a udit process (including auto, gene ral
lia bility, workers' compensation, and excess coverage.) Mr. Hill stated that the analysis also provides
suggestions and projections in re lat ion to the level of excess ins urance the county m ight consider
purc hasing, the self-insured retention base, the deductible amount to retain, and what limits the County
should consider in purchasing excess insurance. Mr. Hill noted that pricing of additiona l coverage is a lso
indicated, at an estimated range of $4.3 million. He explained that the County would have to go into the
marketplace with an RFP to dete rmine a firm price and the coverage conditions that would be acceptable
or be neficial to the County .
In response to Commissioner Ha nsen's question regarding if there was a target date for hav ing a
recommendation or RFP ready on the self-insurance program, Tom G laser stated that the RFP was in the
process of be ing completed and he would keep the committee informed.

Commissioner Butler moved to receive and file Item 6 - Communication 230838. Seconded by Vice
Chairman Goslin, the motion carried.
T he Chairman the n proceeded to the seventh item on the agenda.

C lerk of the Circuit Court - Child Support Enforcement Division, Financial Report for the
year ended November 30, 1997, by Laura A. Burman, County Auditor.

In response to Commissioner Hansen's question o n c hild support receipts regarding what percentage of
do llars are collected versus dollars assessed, Heathe r Cross ley stated that the total dollar amount rece ived
by the C lerk of the C ircuit Court a nd dis bursed is $ 120,707,866 fo r the year ended November 30, 1997.
She stated that the pe rcentage of collected dollars versus assessed do llars is c urrently being compiled for
fiscal year '99.

373

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JANUARY 6, 2000
Ms. Crossley explained that the percentage for prior years was difficult to ascertain from the current records
system, due to the fact that total dollar amounts assessed on any kind of Court ordered action is not captured
in the electronic docket. In addition to that, in July 1997 the C lerk's child support computer system had
been converted over to the State mandated T-KIDS System. In that conversion, she noted, the office did not
take historical balances for prior years. Therefore, she explained, the data is not currently available.
However, the office is working on compiling 1998 numbers to give a comparative view with the data on the
State's T-KIDS System and has contacted the Illino is Department of Public Aid for information since they
are the enforcing agency for child support and are responsible for all of the delinquency notices and
notification to the employers and the obligors. Ms. Crossley added that assessing what is being ordered in
the courtrooms as opposed to what is actually being collected is one of the C lerk's office priority objectives
for the fiscal year '99, especially with the new Single Audit Act coming up for FY 1999.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question regarding the procedure for collecting delinquent child
support and at what point does the county's State's Attorney get involved, George Rada stated that the
Clerk of the C ircuit Court had sent a letter to the State's Attorney's Office regarding this issue and
address ing the C lerk's concerns on the de linquent child support in terms of procedures in place for going
after the obligors.
On this issue, Pat Driscoll with the State's Attorney's Office spoke and confirmed that the office had
received a letter from the C lerk of the Circuit Court.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question regarding unbilled fees due to incorrect mailing addresses
and what is be ing done to improve the 20 percent figure noted on page 14, Heather Crossley stated that
the C lerk of the C ircuit Court's office does capture the name and address of the obligor, and references
this information with the State system which give the Social Security number and various other
information. She explained that the problem occurs when the records referenced in the State system are
not updated and this creates a standstill in regards to what is the correct record. Ms. Crossley noted that
recently (after reading the statute) the C lerk's office became aware that the Jllinois Department of Public
Aid (IOPA) has a parent/spouse locator service and the responsibility to find the rec ipients of the child
support and the obligors.

Commissioner Lechowicz requested that the Clerk's Office submit to the Chairman a written
recommendation on a plan, including any proposed changes to the statutes needed to implement the
plan, that would allow a continual follow-through in trying to get the fee money to the County and
improve the current child support records, collection and distribution procedures and systems.
Commissioner Hansen moved to defer action on Item 7. Seconded by Commissioner Lechowicz.
The motion carried and the item was deferred for future discussion.
Commissioner Hansen moved to adjourn, seconded by Commissioner Butler. T he motion carried
and the meeting was adjourned.
