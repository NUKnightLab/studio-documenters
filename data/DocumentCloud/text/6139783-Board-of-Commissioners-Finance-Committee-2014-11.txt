COMMENTS:

These resources will be devoted to 11 new positions, for the purpose of collaborating around pre-trial release and pre-trial
diversion of inmates at the Cook County Jail. Three L 1s, step 1, are included in the Public Defender's Office, 3 ASAs, step
348, are included in the State's Attorneys Office, and five Pre-Trial Officers, step 1, are included for Adult Probation . Fringe
health benefits are also included in Fixed Charges.
Adult Probation, the Public Defender's Office, and the State's Attorneys Office, have a need for additional resources for the
diversion and release of inmates awaiting their trial. Several initiatives are either in development or ongoing in each
department to serve this purpose. It is the intention of this amendment that the departments utilize the additional resources
to expand their capacity to serve inmates, pre-trial, and to focus their efforts on this issue.
