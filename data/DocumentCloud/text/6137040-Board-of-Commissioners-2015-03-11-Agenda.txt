PROPOSED RESOLUTION
PROTECTING ACCESS TO COMPREHENSIVE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE
AND SUPPORTING INCREASED FUNDING LEVELS
WHEREAS, women need access to safe, affordable, and comprehensive reproductive health care
throughout their lives, including screening for cancer and sexually transmitted infections, contraceptive
services, abortion care, prenatal care, and labor and delivery services; and

Page 3 of 51

 Board of Commissioners

BOARD AGENDA

March 11, 2015

WHEREAS, reproductive health is a vital component of a woman’s overall health, and reproductive
freedom is vital to a woman’s safety, well-being, and ability to participate equally in society; and
WHEREAS, on January 22, 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court, in a historic and landmark decision, ruled in
Roe v. Wade that the U.S. Constitution safeguards a woman’s ability to make her own personal medical
decisions about when or whether to have children; and
WHEREAS, that decision has allowed women to participate more fully in society, saved lives, and
strengthened families and we must always guard against efforts to deliberately erode the availability and
affordability of abortion and undermine the protections provided by Roe v. Wade; and
WHEREAS, the majority of Americans continue to support safe, legal abortion; and
WHEREAS, federal and state laws that place obstacles in the paths of women seeking abortion care take
away the ability of those women to make decisions and threaten the health of families; and
WHEREAS, one such restriction is the Hyde Amendment, passed by Congress on September 30, 1976,
which for nearly 39 years has impeded access to abortion care for low-income women enrolled in
Medicaid; and
WHEREAS, Medicaid coverage for abortion care has a significant effect on low-income women’s
ability to decide to end an unwanted pregnancy, and in the absence of such coverage many women are
unable to obtain an abortion; and
WHEREAS, many women in Cook County, including state and federal employees, obtain insurance
coverage through other public insurance programs that also restrict coverage for abortion; and
WHEREAS, all women should have insurance coverage for comprehensive reproductive health care,
including abortion care, to ensure that their economic status or the source of their insurance coverage
does not affect important health care decisions or access; and
WHEREAS, millions of women nationally, and hundreds of thousands in Illinois and Cook County, are
subject to these inequitable policies; and
WHEREAS, public health insurance should cover all of a woman’s options when she is facing an
unintended pregnancy, so that she is able to make a real decision about what is best for her and her
family; and
WHEREAS, Cook County provides important support for many women to ensure that they have access
to comprehensive reproductive health care, including abortion, but regardless of the resources dedicated
by Cook County, bans on coverage for abortion continue to harm many women; and
WHEREAS, it is imperative that funding of comprehensive reproductive health care be increased and
that abortion be covered as part of comprehensive reproductive health care in all public insurance
programs to ensure that services are accessible for women who are enrolled in such programs.

BOARD AGENDA

March 11, 2015

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and members of the Board of
Commissioners of Cook County call upon federal and state elected officials to maintain the protections
established by Roe v. Wade for access to comprehensive reproductive health care and undo restrictions
that have been placed on those protections; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the President and members of the Board of Commissioners of
Cook County call for increased federal and state funding for comprehensive reproductive health care and
to reinstate coverage for abortion services for women enrolled in public insurance programs.

Concurrences:
The vendor has met the Minority and Women Owned Business Enterprise Ordinance.
Summary: Amend the authorized amount for the below contracts awarded for the Countywide Job
Order Contract (JOC) Program. JOC is a quantity based procurement process that allows facility owners
to complete a multitude of repair/maintenance and construction project with a single, competitively bid
contract. The JOC process involved first selecting a vendor pool of potential contractors through a
competitive procurement process, and identifying projects for such selected vendors. The contractors
were found to be the lowest, responsive and responsible bidder through a competitive bid process in
accordance with the Cook County Procurement Code.
On 3/20/2013, The Board of Commissioners approved contracts with the selected contractors listed
below for the Countywide Job Order Contracting (JOC) Program. The contracts are a two (2) year base
term with two (2) one-year renewal options from the date of execution, 3/20/2013 to 3/19/2015.
The Department of Capital Planning and Policy, the Department of Facilities Management, the
Department of Transportation and Highways, and the Office of the Chief Procurement Officer request
authorization to renew one (1) one-year renewal options from the date of execution; 3/19/2015 to
3/19/2016; and authorize an increase to the JOC Contractors contract authority by $12,000,000.00.
The County is under no obligation to expend the amount requested, and is only obligated to pay JOC
contractors when the construction work is procured through the JOC program. The amendment will
allow the County to extend the utilization of JOC contracts to facilitate all departments’ upcoming
projects through the base contract period with a one (1) one-year renewal option.

BOARD AGENDA

The Chief Procurement Officer concurs.
Summary: On 2/5/2013, the Cook County Board of Commissioners authorized a contract for the Cook
County Juvenile Detention Reduction Project (DRP) under the auspices of the Circuit Court of Cook
County's Juvenile Probation and Court Services Department. The target population is court-involved
minors who may be in jeopardy of an imminent referral to the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center due
to non-compliance with court order/orders.
The DRP augments the court’s nationally recognized Juvenile Detention Alternatives Initiative in
expanding the continuum of community-based services used by judges and probation officers to keep
at-risk minors in their communities and engaged in pro-social interventions in lieu of detention. The
contract provides a wide range of respite care, including educational, therapeutic and recreational
programming, emergency shelter beds and expedited access to clinical services, which respond to the
needs of the juveniles who are referred to participate in this program. Since the beginning of the
program, more than 2,500 minors have received DRP services. In addition, the contract has provided
more than 1,000 bed-days of community housing as an alternative to detention.
This contract was extended with the approval of the Cook County Board in 2014; this increase and
extension request represents the final extension option identified in the original contract.

PROPOSED TRANSFER OF FUNDS

Request: Transfer of Funds
Reason: The transfer of funds is needed to extend contract for Professional Services of three I.T.
programmers for Mainframe and .Net programming to assist with electronic filing, imaging operations
and the implementation of the Standard File Room Operating Procedures (SFROP) Project.
From Account(s): 335-240, $83,200.00
To Account(s): 335-260, $83,200.00
Total Amount of Transfer: $83,200.00
On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
1/30/2015, $0.00, $0.00
How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
Account 335-240, Printing and Publishing, was identified as the source of transfer of funds for the
purchase of Personal Issue Traffic Tickets for the City of Chicago and Suburban Traffic Tickets. The
placement of a supplemental order of tickets in 2014 with FY 2014 funds while awaiting the bid and
award of a new traffic ticket contract, reduced the need for a larger order of tickets in 2015. Therefore,
as a result of the supplemental order of tickets, we anticipate purchasing a reduced quantity of additional
tickets in FY 2015.
Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
As a result of supplemental tickets ordered in 2014, we anticipate that an additional FY 2015 order for
traffic tickets will be less than previously anticipated, hence the availability of funds in Account
335-240 for a transfer.

Summary: R&S Associates has more than 30-years of experience as a designer and builder of
specialized mainframe computer applications. He has headed numerous process improvement initiatives
that spanned organizations and agencies. Most recently, R&S Associates has designed and programmed
systems supporting the Cook County Treasurer’s Office. This unique knowledge is not available
internally within Cook County, or externally.
Additionally, as the County moves to replace their 40+ year old property tax system, with a new
integrated property tax system, R&S Associates’ detailed knowledge of mainframe operations and
systems will be invaluable
