CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER WILLIAM T. FOLEY
Mr. Foley presented information regarding the following (Attachment #1):
Revised Chief Executive Officer’s 90 Day – 6 Month – 1 Year Plan for the Cook County Health
and Hospitals System

 REPORT OF THE MEETING
OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE
COOK COUNTY HEALTH AND HOSPITALS SYSTEM
AUGUST 12, 2009
Page 3
Mr. Foley briefly reviewed the plan. He stated that Navigant Consulting’s performance improvement
assessment will probably not be completed until mid to late September, as they are having difficulties gathering
the data that is needed. He indicated that the Board should be receiving a thorough update from Navigant at
their meeting on August 26th.
With regard to the status of filling leadership positions, Mr. Foley informed the Board that the position of Chief
Compliance Officer has been filled. Cathy Bodnar, who previously worked for seven years as Director of
Compliance at Northwestern, will be starting in September. He added that a Chief Information Officer has been
hired; information on the individual’s identity will be released at a later date.
Briefing on Potential Integration of OB/Gyn Residency Program
Mr. Foley stated that Dr. John Raba, System Interim Chief Medical Officer and Dr. Maurice Lemon, Chief
Medical Officer of John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County, would be presenting the Board with a briefing
on a time-sensitive issue.
Dr. Lemon explained that Northwestern and our own obstetrics and gynecology leadership have forwarded the
outlines of a proposal to consider, to completely integrate the OB/Gyn residencies between the two institutions.
Currently, there is an affiliation agreement under which their residents come here and our residents go there.
This would represent a move beyond that, to a complete integration of those two programs. A letter is being
drafted to the Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) on this subject, the idea is to
start in July 2010. Because of the lead time in recruiting classes, a letter to apply for next July would have to be
received within a week or so. He added that the System has successfully integrated in the past, providing the
example of Rush and the Surgery Residency Program.
Dr. Lemon continued by stating that a contract would still need to be drafted and brought before the Board for
approval once the details were worked out. But for now, the letter being drafted to ACGME will have the
System’s commitment to not recruit the first year class next year in OB/Gyn.
The Board reviewed and discussed the information. Dr. Lemon stated that he could forward the draft letter to
the Board for their review.
Director Carvalho stated that he would like to pose a couple of questions, which did not need to be answered at
this meeting. First, the Board will want to know whether Northwestern is paying the System’s doctors beyond
what the System is paying them in connection with those activities. Second, because of the nature of obstetrics,
when a patient is a returning client for seven or eight months, there has always been a continuity of care issue
when you have a residency program providing for that care. Pregnant women coming to Stroger Hospital may
see a different doctor every time they visit. He requested that they try to build something into the agreement to
address this concern.
Mr. Foley stated that at this time, they are requesting the Board’s input and support to proceed with the letter
and development of a proposal.
Director Lyne, seconded by Director Greenspan, moved to support the Chief Executive Officer and
medical staff’s actions to negotiate this transaction, with the understanding that the final agreement will
be brought back for the Board’s approval. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

REPORT FROM THE SYSTEM
INTERIM CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER JOHN RABA, MD
Dr. Raba presented information regarding the following (Attachment #2):
Integration of System-wide Clinical Services
Dr. Raba pointed out that since the last time he reported on the subject, two additional departments have been
integrated System-wide.
Collaborations within and outside the System
Dr. Raba informed the Board that they will have a report at their meeting of August 26th on the System’s
ongoing efforts with regard to preparedness for H1N1 (Swine Flu).
Single Medical Staff Bylaws
Dr. Raba stated that efforts continue on the draft of the single medical staff bylaws. It is expected that the final
draft will be presented to the three hospital bylaws committees by September 1, 2009. He hopes to have
everything finalized, after review and approval by the appropriate entities, by late Fall in 2009.
Physician Salary Issue
Dr. Raba provided an update on an issue that came up in the Human Resources Committee with regard to
physician salary inequity corrections. He was directed to create a plan that would equalize salaries for similar
specialties and primary care providers. The plan was created and implemented; changes were made in the
payroll system and these salary adjustments will begin to be received by the providers on August 26th.
Accountability and Productivity
With regard to dual employment standards for the clinical leaders, these have been finalized, and compliance by
the Department Chairs is being implemented. By August 15th, Department Chairs with outside ongoing
practices are to have agreed upon a plan to eliminate their practices by no later than December 1st.

APPROVAL OF
PATIENT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Gretchen Ryan, of MedAssets, presented the proposed patient accounting policies, entitled Revenue Cycle
Policies (Attachment #3).
Ms. Ryan noted that page three of the handout listed all of the policies before them, with the exception of the
Uninsured Patient Discounts. That policy is pending legal review, and is not being presented for their
consideration at this time.
Ms. Ryan highlighted the CareLink program, which is what would currently be considered the Limit of Liability
program. Going forward, it is a financial assistance program for Cook County residents at or below 450% of the
federal poverty guidelines.
The Board discussed the proposed $10.00 co-pay amount; Director Carvalho inquired whether there was a
difference in co-pays for a four-day inpatient stay compared to a 15-minute outpatient visit.
Albert De La Cruz, of MedAssets, responded that the $10.00 co-pay is for medical services, regardless of
whether it is relating to those received as an inpatient or outpatient, or relating to length of stay. Ms. Ryan
provided an example; if a patient sees three separate clinics in one location on one given day, the patient will
have a $10.00 co-pay for each clinic visit, totaling $30.00 in co-pays for that given day.
In response to questions from Director Ansell regarding the underinsured, Ms. Ryan stated that underinsured
patients served by the System would need to have insurance with a company that the System participates with.
Additionally, each contract that the System has with these insurance companies needs to be reviewed to see if
the co-pay can be waived.
Director Carvalho noted that consistency with policies across the System is important.
information on what the local federally-qualified health care centers charge for co-pays.

He requested

Director Greenspan inquired as to the projected implementation date. Ms. Ryan responded that implementation
of these policies needs to be staggered; it is paired with the financial counseling initiative. The first one would
be tied to the October 1st goal of inpatient financial counseling across the System. The timeline for outpatient
financial counseling was January 1, 2010.
It was stated that the Board would receive a report on the feedback from the medical staff after their review of
the policies.
Director Greenspan, seconded by Director Lyne, moved to approve the proposed Revenue Cycle Policies.
THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

of $2.6 million for the Family Practice Program for services between Loyola and Provident.

Medical School Relationships. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

continue to meet every week to talk about the progress made with the planning process. They are still in the
discovery phase, in which John Abendshein’s group is gathering external information to get feedback on the
System’s strengths and weaknesses. They are expecting to start getting some of the preliminary findings from
Mr. Abendshein in the next couple of weeks. She referenced the remaining town hall meetings (Attachment #4).
Chairman Batts suggested that for the town hall meetings, in addition to showing the System’s mission,
information such as three-year cost trends should be provided, also.
Mr. Foley announced that there will be a seventh town hall meeting set, specifically for the Hispanic/Latino
community.
With regard to meetings of the Board for strategic planning, Mr. Foley stated that there will be a three-hour
Board meeting dedicated to the strategic planning process on September 18th. Additionally, a retreat is planned
for early October; the Board will be polled for their availability to set that date.
Mr. Foley stated that at the retreat, they would have the framework for the plan, which would be reviewed with
the Board in detail. Assuming agreement is reached at the retreat, during the month of October there will be
various meetings with the constituencies throughout the System and County.
There will be a second round of town hall meetings in the month of October. The goal is to bring the plan back
to the Board for official action at the November 5th meeting.

Interim System CMO Report
CCHHS Meeting

Integration of System-wide Clinical Services
20 clinical departments, divisions, and programs have now been designated as systemwide entities. Since the last CMO report system chairs of Otolaryngology and Family
Planning have been added to Adult Endocrine, Breast Cancer, Emergency Medicine,
Family Practice, Gastroenterology, Hematology-Oncology, Infectious Diseases,
Neurology, OB-Gyn, Ophthalmology, Pain, Pediatrics, Palliative Care, Psychiatry,
Pulmonary/Critical Care, Radiology Rehabilitation and Physical Medicine, Surgery, and
Urology. Cardiology, Rheurnatology, Dermatology, and Infection Control are in process.
Searches for System Chairs of Anesthesiology, LaboratorylPathology,and Medicine are
in various stages of completion.
Respiratory therapy services at Stroger, Provident, and Oak Forest Hospitals have been
placed under the administration of the system Division of Pulmonary/Critical Care.
Respiratory Therapy had been the only clinical technical service in the CCHHS that did
not report to clinical leadership.
Each department is submitting metrics to evaluate clinical services across the CCHHS.
The job description for System-wide Clinical Chairs has been finalized and will be
presented to the HR committee.

Collaborations within and outside the System
Radiology staffing levels at Provident Hospital have been assessed and opportunities to
expand on-site radiologist coverage, maximize productivity, and minimize utilization of
contracted radiologist hours have being identified. Annual savings to the CCHHS will be
>$400,000.
OB-Gyn has identified two Stroger physicians who will provide OB-Gyn consultation
services at Oak Forest Hospital. They are completing their OFH credentials applications.
Gastroenterology services staffed by a recent grad of the Stroger Hospital GI fellowship
program has started at Oak Forest Hospital where he will provide inpatient and outpatient
consultations.
Efforts are in process to allow non-CCHHS FQHC community health center partners to
have access to medical information in Cerner on shared patients. This arrangement will
be discussed at the IT taskforce meeting on 8/19/09.
Discussions have been initiated with the University of Chicago concerning opportunities
for collaborative relationships with Provident Hospital concerning a range of patient care
services and with ACHN concerning U of C's 87thStreet clinic.
The hospital Quality Directors long with the System CMO, CCO, and COO are
developing an organizational structure that unifies the approach to quality and patient
safety at both the local affiliates and throughout the CCHHS

Single Medical Staff Bylaws
The State's Attorneys and representatives of the CMOs continue to work on the final
draft of unified System medical staff bylaws. It is firmly anticipated that the draft of the
single bylaws will be presented to the three hospital bylaws committees by September 1,
2009. The bylaws committees will be then given 6 weeks to separately and jointly
review the document. The States Attorneys will review and incorporate revisions
recommended by the bylaws committees and CMOs into a final document that will be

 15

scheduled to be voted upon by the medical staffs of the System. It is anticipated that
draft will be ready for vote in the late Fall, 2009.

Physician Salary Issue
The physician salary adjustments that addressed inequities exacerbated by the new CCB
physician salary scale have been entered into the payroll system and will be begin to be
received by the providers on August 26,2009.
A comparative study of current CCHHS salary levels for primary care and specialty
physicians has been initiated using benchmarks established by the AAMC and the
SullivanCotterPhysician Reimbursement Survey.

Accountability and Productivity
System-wide metrics that are facility, center, and provider specific continue to be
identified by system chairs.
Departmental and Divisional accountability expectations are being audited at all facilities
in the CCHHS.
Dual employment standards for clinical leaders have been finalized. Compliance by
Department chairs with these standards is being implemented. By 8/15/09, Department

programs, must apply for such coverage to be eligible to apply for CareLink assistance. Medicare beneficiaries
must be enrolled in Medicare Part D to receive assistance under CareLink and are also subject to asset limits.
Individuals who decline employer-sponsored health insurance are not eligible to participate in the CareLink
program. All patients receiving assistance under CareLink must pay a $10 co-pay at the time of each clinical
service to contribute to the cost of their care. Assistance to qualified residents of Cook County is available for
any of the health system’ facilities. System facilities include John H. Stroger of Cook County, Oak Forrest

Section I.

Program Overview

Cook County Health & Hospitals System has the responsibility of providing medical care to the indigent
residents of Cook County, Illinois. CareLink is a healthcare assistance program intended to provide financial
assistance to qualified Cook County residents. This document establishes the requirements to determine
eligibility for the CareLink program.
Program Guidelines
The CareLink Policy will comply with all state laws and precedent set by the Illinois Department of Healthcare
and Family Services (IDHFS).
CareLink eligibility will be administered by the financial counseling services department and patient
registration operations unit. CCHHS will utilize federal poverty guidelines as published annually in the Federal
Register as the basis for income eligibility thresholds.
Income eligibility is based on the following Federal Poverty Income Levels (FPIL) as follows:
Individuals with an annual income equal to or less than 250% of the Federal Poverty guidelines as
established in the Federal Register annually are eligible for a 100% discount of total charges.
Individuals with an annual income greater than 250% of the federal poverty level but equal to or less
than 350% of the current years Federal Poverty guidelines as established in the Federal Register
annually are eligible for a 50% discount of total charges.
Individuals with an annual income greater than 350% of the federal poverty level but equal to or less
than 450% of the current years Federal Poverty guidelines as established in the Federal Register
annually are eligible for a 25% discount of total charges.
Individuals with an income above 450% are not eligible for assistance under the CareLink program.

Criteria Evaluated
Applicants must meet all eligibility requirements to be eligible. Program eligibility determinations are based on
analysis of the following criteria:
Established Cook County Residence
Third Party Funding Sources
Identification
Household Composition
Income
Page 3 of 25

 Resources (as required by Medicare regulations for indigence)

32

It is the applicant's responsibility to present required documentation to substantiate the criteria above.
Applicants who refuse to provide this documentation are not eligible. Applicants will be made aware that
independent verification is a part of the eligibility process. This includes the use of all available technology to
include, but not limited to the use of credit reporting bureaus. Applicants are required to provide written
attestation to the validity and accuracy of information provided.

Reasonable Judgment Eligibility Decisions
Every effort will be made to determine an applicant’s eligibility based on policies and procedures in this
document as well as those in IDHFS TANF guidelines, Medicaid Eligibility policy and Illinois statute. In those
instances where a clearly defined policy does not exist, CCHHS recognizes and encourages the use of a
“Reasonable Judgment Rule” to reach a decision about an applicant’s CareLink eligibility. The “Reasonable
Judgment Rule” is addressed in this policy manual.

Patient Financial Obligations
All applicants enrolled in the CareLink program are required to make a ten dollar ($10.00) co-payment at the
time of each clinical service. The ability or inability to meet the program’s patient financial obligations does
not affect eligibility or ability to receive healthcare services. However, failure to satisfy this financial obligation
will result in enforcement of CCHHS’ standard collection efforts.
Pharmacy Financial Obligations
Use of CCHHS pharmacies is limited to patients enrolled in the CareLink program. Prescriptions must be
written by a CCHHS staff physician. All applicants enrolled in the CareLink program are required to make a four
dollar $4.00 co-payment per prescription prior to the medication(s) being dispensed. All prescriptions will be
limited to a 30-day supply per co-payment. Patients who do not have the ability to make the necessary copayment will only receive a 14-day supply of the prescribed medications on a one-time basis.
Right to Appeal Process
Every applicant will be afforded the right to appeal any decision related to program eligibility. The applicant’s
right to appeal is addressed at the end of this policy.

Section II. Patient Identity Procedures

determining eligibility. Types of income are “Countable Income” and “Exempt Income”. The income of the
applicant and applicable household members must be considered when determining eligibility. For the
purposes of determining eligibility, income is either counted or exempt.
Countable Income

Commissions
Bonus
Alimony support
Child support payments
Retirement Survivors Disability Insurance (RSDI). These are benefits from the Social Security
Administration

Section VI. Income Determination Process
Calculating Income
Income determination for eligibility is based on verified gross monthly income. Not every applicant or
household member receives income on a once monthly basis. Often a household’s income must be converted
from a non-monthly amount into a monthly amount.
Converting Income to Monthly Values
The following table lists the different conversion formulas to be used when converting income to a monthly
amount.
If the applicant or household member Then convert the income to a monthly amount
receives income …
by…
Weekly

Multiplying weekly average by 4.33

Every Other Week

Multiplying bi-weekly average by 2.17

Twice Monthly

Multiplying twice monthly average by 2

Once Monthly

Multiplying once monthly average by 1

Yearly (Self-employed)

Dividing previous tax years gross income by 12

Documenting Income
All household income, counted or exempted, must be verified and documented. An applicant’s statement of
income will not be accepted as income verification.

Page 11 of 25

 40
Employment Income Verification
An applicant’s or household member’s most recent paycheck stubs are the preferred method of verifying
Employment Income. Acceptable forms of income verification may include:
Required at application:
Income Frequency

Pay Stubs Required

Weekly

Two (2) Payroll check stubs, dated within
last 30 days, if employed full-time and paid
weekly.

Supplemental Security Income Award letters (SSI)
Statement of dividends, interest and royalties
Education/training stipends (specified for living expenses)

Section VII. Third Party Funding Sources
Page 12 of 25

 41
All patients applying must have a review of availability to third party funding (i.e., health insurance) completed
as part of the eligibility assessment process. The review of health insurance availability is split into three broad
categories: Access to Health Insurance, Enrollment in Health Insurance, and Other Funding Programs.
Third Party Funding Access
Enrollment in Employer-Sponsored Health Insurance
Applicants who are eligible, but not enrolled, in an employer-sponsored health plan at the time of application
are not eligible for the CareLink assistance program.
Applicants who are enrolled in an employer-sponsored health plan at the time of application can be eligible
for the CareLink assistance program if they meet all eligibility criteria, and their insurance plan is considered
“In-Network” with CCHHS.
Enrollment in Other Funding Programs
Applicants who are enrolled in a funding program not sponsored by an employer such as Medicare and
Medicaid at the time of application may be eligible for CareLink assistance as a secondary or tertiary funding
source.

Other Funding Program Eligible Applicants
CCHHS, as a provider of care for indigent Cook County residents provides for patient admissions and
outpatient visits using many different funding sources. Often, these programs may be limited in the scope of
services funded for reimbursement. As such, the applicant can use CareLink Assistance together with another
funding program for a healthcare service. An eligible patient should be reassessed anytime a third party
funding source is identified and verified.

Section VIII. Resource Determination for Medicare Eligible Patients
Overview
Medicare recipients may be eligible for program coverage as secondary or tertiary coverage. However, Federal
regulations require that Medicare providers follow certain guidelines when determining a patient’s indigence.
More specifically, Federal regulations state:
“The provider should take into account an applicant’s total resources which would include, but
are not limited to, an analysis of assets (only those convertible to cash and unnecessary for the
applicant’s daily living), liabilities, and income and expenses. In making this analysis the
provider should take into account any extenuating circumstances that would affect the
determination of the applicant’s indigence.”
Page 13 of 25

 In addition, Medicare patients must also provide documentation related to personal assets at the time42
of
application. The resource determination criteria in this section of the CareLink policy only apply to Medicare
eligible applicants.
Resource Limits
A Medicare eligible applicant’s total assets cannot exceed $5,000.00 at the time of the application. This
amount is to be used for the household unit’s combined assets; and not $5,000.00 per household member.
Evaluating Resources
There are two types of Resources, Liquid and Non-liquid. Liquid resources are resources that are readily
available and can be converted to cash.
Liquid Resources
Cash
Checking & saving accounts
Stocks
Bonds.
Non-liquid Resources
Items that generally take more than 30 days to convert to a liquid resource.
Inaccessible
Irrevocable trust funds,
Property in probate,

*The applicant provides proof that the property cannot be sold with the consent of the owner others, and
*The owners of joint property refuse to sell or divide the property.

Fair Market Value
Fair market value (FMV) is the amount of money the sale of an asset would bring to the seller in normal
market conditions. FMV is counted when determining eligibility. Use the average wholesale price of the asset
to determine fair market value. If the applicant or household member states money is owed on an asset see
directly below.
Equity Value
The equity value of a resource is counted when determining eligibility if the applicant or household member
owes money on a resource. Equity value is the fair market value of the asset minus
All money owed on the resource
Any cost associated with the sale of the resource
Page 14 of 25

 43
Countable versus Exempt Resources
Resources of the applicant and eligible household members are to be considered in the eligibility evaluation
process. Not all resources will be counted towards the maximum total allowable amount of $5,000.00.
Resource Types
Bank Accounts
Countable
Checking
Savings
Certificates of Deposit
Money Market accounts.
Individual Retirement Account (IRA)
Annuities
Stocks
Bonds.
Exempt
401(K) & 403(B)
Keogh Plan
Simplified Employee Pension (SEP)
Vehicles
Automobiles & Trucks
Exempt the value of the applicant’s primary vehicle.
If the applicant or household owns more than one vehicle, apply the exemption to the vehicle with the
highest equity value as the primary vehicle. Count the equity value of all other vehicles the applicant or
household owns.
Other Vehicles
Count the equity or fair market value of other vehicles if not exempted as a primary vehicle or for business
purposes. This includes motorcycles, boats, farm vehicles, motor homes, etc.
Property
Homestead
Exempt the applicant’s homestead and surrounding property. This exemption also applies for the following
conditions:
Page 15 of 25

 44
Any structure the household uses as a primary residence including trailer homes, motor homes, and
houseboats. Note: If the household does not live in the structure it is counted as a resource.

Income Producing Property
Exempt property that the household owns, if it used to generate income. Examples of income producing
property include;
Machinery
Business inventory
Oil, gas, and mineral rights
Livestock.

Verification of Resources
Verification is required for all counted resources. Resource values are assessed at the time of application.
Bank Accounts
Current bank statement dated within 30 days from date of application or interview. Use the average
daily balance as the countable resource amount.
Other Financial Accounts
Most recent statement from the financial institution dated within 30 days or the last quarterly
statement, whichever is more recent. Stocks and bonds may be calculated by applying the value of the
particular stock or bond from a recent newspaper (value x number of shares).
Vehicles
Vehicle values can be obtained from NADA’s website http://www.nadaguides.com/ or related sources.
The “Average Trade In” column is used. Note: Do not increase value if the vehicle has low-mileage. The
applicant or household may provide an appraisal from a recognized car dealership if the vehicle is in
less than average condition.
Property
Use the tax appraisal district, financial institution, or statement from a real estate company.

Section IX. Application Process
Applicant Rights & Responsibilities

Residents of Cook County have the right to submit an application for review and eligibility determination. Each
applicant should be treated with dignity and respect during an interview for potential program eligibility.
Before completing the eligibility interview, Financial Counselors must:
Ensure the applicant has a thoroughly completed application with all required supporting
documentation.
Review rights and responsibilities.
Confirm the applicant understands the rights and responsibilities.
Explain the program’s eligibility and verification requirements.
Reasonable Judgment Rule
Unique applicant situations can and will arise. As such CCHHS will apply reasonable judgment in making
eligibility determinations.
When staff encounter unusual applicant situations, or there is no clearly defined policy guideline. CCHHS
encourages the use of logical judgment and sound reasoning in making eligibility determinations. The
“Reasonable Judgment Rule” encourages staff to make reasonable decisions based on the best available
information using:
Program knowledge
Experience
Applicant circumstances
The rationale used to make the decision must be documented, including any references to applicable
information sources.

Conflict of Interest
Financial Counselors must not process a charity-based program application if a conflict of interest exists. A
conflict of interest is defined as situations where an employee/contracted employee and the applicant are in a
personal relationship; situations in which the applicant is the employee’s/contracted employee roommate,
relative or acquaintance. Examples include:

Father or mother
Grandfather or grandmother
Brother or sister
Page 17 of 25

 46

Uncle or aunt
First cousin
Nephew or niece
Stepfather or stepmother
Stepbrother or stepsister
First cousin once removed
Neighbor
Business Associate
Acquaintance
The conflict of interest relationship restriction extends up to:
The spouse of the listed relatives, even after the marriage has ended in death or divorce;
The degree of "great-great" for uncles/aunts and nephews/nieces; and
The degree of "great-great-great" for grandparents.

The conflict of interest also extends to include the spouse of the listed relatives even when the married couple
(listed relative and spouse) is “separated.” Financial Counselors should inform their immediate supervisor of
the potential conflict of interest and request that another Financial Counselor determine the applicant’s
eligibility. Similarly, management staff must defer to another member of management if a potential conflict of
interest exists during the appeals process.

Interview/Enrollment Appointments
CareLink enrollment will primarily be handled by appointment only. Patients requesting assistance will
provided with detailed instructions and an application packet via telephone or in person. Once the applicants
have completed the application and gathered all supporting documentation they will be provided with the
phone number to call and schedule an appointment for a face-to-face interview with a financial counselor to
determine eligibility. This process will primarily be initiated during the pre-registration process in the
outpatient areas as well as while the patient is inpatient. Enrollment in the CareLink program will not be
available to walk-in patients due to volume. Walk-in patients will be required to follow the same procedures
and schedule an appointment once they’ve completed their application packet and have all supporting
documentation available.
Application Submission
Applicants must complete the “Application for CareLink as part of the eligibility review process. The applicant
or authorized representative can request an application in person or by telephone. All applications must be
completed and signed by the applicant or a representative.
Note: CCHHS employees/contracted employees may assist with the completion of the application in situations
where the applicant cannot reasonably complete the application him/herself, but the applicant or
Page 18 of 25

 47
representative must sign the application attesting to its accuracy. All applications for assistance through the
CareLink program must be submitted complete and with all supporting documentation in order to be
scheduled for a face-to-face interview appointment. Incomplete applications or applications missing the
necessary supporting documentation will be denied. Denied applications and all supporting documentation
will be returned to the applicant at time of denial and the patient will be provided with an “Eligibility
Determination Notice” as well as instructions on how to re-apply for assistance.

Face-to-Face Interview
The interview process is a face-to-face interview with the applicant and by scheduled appointment only.
Interviews will only be conducted if the application packet is 100% complete, and all supporting documents
attached. Financial Counselors are the designated staff responsible for eligibility determination process.
Supporting Documentation
It is the responsibility of the applicant or representative to provide any and all supporting documents
identified as necessary to determine eligibility during the interview. Failure to provide the appropriate
documents will result in denial. The applicant will be responsible for re-scheduling another appointment once
they have secured all required documentation.

Other Funding Program Sources
CareLink is a payer of last resort. Financial Counselors must explore potential eligibility for other funding
program sources (e.g., Medicaid, Crime Victims, etc.) prior to certifying patients for eligibility. If a patient is
potentially eligible for another financial assistance program(s) the patient must apply for assistance with the
appropriate agency and denied prior to being approved for CareLink Assistance. Any patient who fails or
refuses to comply with this eligibility requirement is not eligible for CareLink assistance. Accounts on patients
who have applied for assistance through other funding sources will remain financially classified as “Self-Pay”
until final disposition is reached on applications for assistance with the other funding sources. At CCHHS’
management discretion applicants pending eligibility for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) assistance may
be processed for CareLink assistance based on several factors. This might include consideration of the length
of time it currently takes the Social Security Administration to process and approve claims for SSI, high account
balances, and account aging. Another consideration would include the applicant’s SSI claim and the current
level of appeal with SSA.
Disposition of Application at Interview
The “Notice of Eligibility Determination” is the applicant's notice of eligibility status. At the end of the
application review and face-to-face interview with the patient the financial counselor will have reached one of
two outcome options. This includes:

Denied Application

Approved Application
The financial counselor will complete the “Notice of Eligibility Determination” letter informing the applicant of
their eligibility (or continuing eligibility for recipients reapplying to extend their benefits). The “Notice of
Eligibility Determination” letter will contain the following:
Applicants name
Medical record number
Effective beginning and ending dates of CareLink eligibility (Eligibility Coverage Period)
Level of Assistance (e.g., 100% or a partial discount)
Effective date of the decision
The right to appeal
The right to re-apply
The financial counselor will advise the household about their right to appeal the decision if there are concerns
about the amount of eligibility provided. Additionally, remind the recipient they are required to report any
change in their residency, household composition, or income. Explain that failure to do so will result in
termination of coverage dating back to the date of the unreported change.
Denied Application
The financial counselor will complete the “Notice of Eligibility Determination” letter informing the applicant of
their denial. The “Notice of Eligibility Determination” letter will contain the following:
Applicants name
Medical record number
Specific reason for denial; as listed below.
Effective date of the decision
The right to appeal
The right to re-apply
i. Incomplete application or missing/invalid supporting documentation
ii. Residency outside Cook County, Illinois
iii. Failure to keep appointment
iv. Income exceeds program limits for applicant’s household unit size
v. Access to employer-sponsored health insurance coverage
vi. Medicare Resource Limits Exceeded (Based on federal guidelines)
vii. Applicant’s identification not established
8. Non-Compliance (Not completing the requirement to apply for other funding program sources)
9. Failure to report changes in “Residency, Household Composition, or Income.”
Continuing Eligibility Reviews
Each time a recipient of the CareLink program presents for services at CCHHS registration staff must conduct a
mini-review to establish continuing eligibility. This review is designed to determine if any changes have
Page 20 of 25

 49
occurred in the recipient’s circumstances that would affect CareLink eligibility. Continuing Eligibility Reviews
may also be conducted as part of the pre-registration for scheduled services. These changes include but are
not limited to:
Residency
Income
Employment
Household composition
Resources(Medicare Beneficiaries Only)
Access to Employer group health coverage
Registration staff is required to conduct the continuing eligibility review questions in an open-ended question
format, meaning the patient must provide responses with more than a YES or NO response. For example,
instead of asking the patient, “Do you still reside at 1313 Mockingbird Lane?” the registrar would ask the
question, “Can you please verify the address we currently have on file for you?”
When a status change is identified during the mini-review, the patient will be directed to a Financial Counselor
who will interview the patient to determine if the status change affects program eligibility. This must occur
prior to services being rendered, if possible. If not possible, this should be accomplished prior to the patient
being discharged. Financial Counselors are responsible for explaining to the patient that failure to see a
financial counselor could result in termination of their CareLink assistance. Additionally, the patient should be
reminded that CareLink policy requires changes be reported within 14 days of the change. If the financial
counselor determines the changes were not reported within 14 days of the change as required by policy, then
CareLink eligibility should be terminated effective that day. In these situations, the patient must be provided
with a “Notice of Eligibility Determination” stating reason for termination, as well as instructions for reapplying if the event the patient desires to re-apply.

Section X. Eligibility Periods
Automatic 12-Month Eligibility Period
Eligibility can remain in effect for a period of 12 consecutive months from the date of the approval. There are
certain recipients who, when all eligibility criteria have been satisfied, may be eligible for a 12-consecutive
month period. This includes:
Medicare recipients
Medicare/Medicaid recipients
Recipients receiving disability and waiting for Medicare enrollment
Pregnant women
Children not otherwise eligible for Medicaid
Applicants employed on the date of application approval
Applicants exempted from employment services registration
Applicants unemployed but registered for employment services
Page 21 of 25

 50
Retroactive Eligibility
Retroactive eligibility can be allowed for up to 12 consecutive months prior to the date of approval, provided
the patient is met all eligibility criteria during that time frame. Retroactive eligibility applies only to the
patient’s self-pay account(s) or balances. Any patient who was not a verified Cook County resident or did not
meet all of the eligibility criteria in any of the 12 months prior to the date of application approval is not eligible
for retroactive coverage for that month(s).

Eligibility Extension – Hospitalization
In certain situations, an eligible patient will be hospitalized beyond the “Effective To” date on the CareLink
program; although, at admission, the eligibility was in effect. When this occurs, the patient’s eligibility is
adjusted to discharge date.

Less than 12-Month Eligibility Period
The enrollment period for CareLink is not 12 consecutive months in the following situation:
Recipients who claim temporary incapacity and do not register for employment services.
The applicant will need to provide proof of temporary incapacity by having a treating physician or licensed
clinician (such as a physician assistant or registered nurse) complete a “Medical Statement.” The length of
eligibility is based on the amount of time the physician or clinician certifies the patient as being
temporarily disabled. An example is provided below.
A male, 27 year-old patient with a fractured leg does not have a long-term disability. He states he
works in construction and won’t be able to work for a while. The patient applies for CareLink
assistance on September 2nd. The patient has his doctor complete the Medical Statement, which
indicates that the patient cannot return to work for three (3) months. The patient brought in all other
documentation and otherwise meets criteria.
The patient would be certified effective from September 2nd and lasting to December 2nd. At the end of
this eligibility period the patient would need to re-establish eligibility by registering for employment
services with IDES, or obtaining a second medical statement certifying the extension of the patient’s
temporary incapacity.
Eligibility Periods Based on Medical Statement
Every applicant needing a medical statement must have the statement completed by a licensed physician,
physician’s assistant, or nurse practitioner familiar with the patients care. The statement must include
language related to one of the three following designations.
Page 22 of 25

 51

Permanently Incapacitated

This designation is used for patients with a medical condition or illness that prevents a return to work
permanently. Applicant is eligible for a period of up to 12 consecutive months.
Indefinitely Incapacitated
This designation is used for patients where the medical condition is severe, a return to work is not
immediately known, but the condition may not be permanently disabling. Applicant is eligible for a period
of up to six (6) consecutive months. A re-evaluation of the medical condition must occur after the eligibility
period ends.
Temporarily Incapacitated
This designation is used for patients treated for a medical condition that, under usual medical
circumstances, can be expected to last for a finite period of time; for example, recovery from an
appendectomy. The clinician must state a definitive period of time the patient’s temporary incapacity can
be expected to last. Applicant is eligible for the period of time as described in the medical statement. A reevaluation of the medical condition must occur after the eligibility period ends if the patient wants to
continue eligibility based on the temporary incapacity.
Note: Enroll an eligible applicant for a minimum of one (1) month if the medical statement indicates a
treatment period of less than 30 days.

Dual Medicare & Medicaid Eligibility
Applicants eligible for Medicare and Medicaid simultaneously are deemed “Indigent” by Federal and State
Government Agencies and therefore qualify for CareLink. Medicare eligible patients also eligible for any of the
following Medicaid programs should be considered financially eligible for the CareLink program:
Any Traditional or Managed Care Medicaid Plan
Medicaid Qualified Medicare Beneficiary (MQMB)
Qualified Medicare Beneficiary (QMB)
Dual eligible applicants must provide the following documentation:
Proof of Medicare and Medicaid eligibility at the time of application, and
Cook County residency.
***All other eligibility elements are waived for Dual Eligible applicants***
Page 23 of 25

 52
Eligibility secondary to commercial or managed care
Applicants with a commercial health insurance or managed care health insurance plan may be eligible for
CareLink assistance as a secondary plan. The applicant’s health insurance plan must be considered “innetwork” (contracted with CCHHS or a “fee-for-service” indemnity policy) as a part of the eligibility
assessment. The applicant must also meet all other applicable eligibility criteria as described in this policy.

Section XI. Complaints, Grievances, and Appeals
Overview
Applicant disagreements regarding denials should be addressed to the financial counselor completing
the denial.
If the applicant is not satisfied with the explanation or reason, the applicant may file an appeal by
contacting the financial counseling supervisor where the interview took place. The financial counselor
or supervisor upon receipt of notice of appeal, either written or verbal must schedule an appointment
with the applicant to hear their appeal within 10 business days. The applicant may be required to
present additional documentation in compliance with this policy for the appeal process.
The financial counseling supervisor will review the patients CareLink application and all supporting
documentation and determine if the appeal hearing is necessary in order to reach a favorable decision.
If the hearing is necessary, it should take place as scheduled. If not, the hearing is cancelled and the
patient notified of the favorable outcome. The patient must be notified of the financial counseling
supervisor’s decision no later than 10 business days following the appeal hearing.
If the applicant is not satisfied with the Financial Counseling Supervisor’s decision, the applicant will be
referred to the Financial Counseling Director for further review. The Financial Counseling Director will
review the file and render a final decision in writing and notify the applicant within 10 business days
from the date the appeal was referred. The Financial Counseling Director may request that the patient
provide additional documentation to assist in resolving the dispute.
If the applicant is not satisfied with the Financial Counseling Director’s decision, the applicants file will
be referred to the Director of Financial Control for final resolution.

Policy
Number:RCPAS07

Core Policy
Area Specific Policy

Purpose:
Under the Red Flag Rule, every “Creditor” with “Covered Accounts” is required to establish an
Identity Theft Prevention Program tailored to the size, complexity and nature of its operations. The
Program must contain policies and procedures reasonably designed to:
1. Identify relevant “Red Flags” for new and existing “covered accounts” and incorporate those
Red Flags into the Program.
2. Be able to detect Red Flags that have been incorporated into the Program.
3. Respond appropriately to any Red Flags that are detected in order to prevent and mitigate
“Identity Theft.”
4. Update the Program periodically to reflect changes in risks to our patients and to the safety
and soundness of our Organization from Identity Theft.

Scope: Adoption of The Identity Theft Prevention Program
Cook County Health and Hospitals System developed this Identity Theft Prevention Program (“the
Program”) pursuant to the Federal Trade Commission’s Red Flag Rule (“the Rule”), 16 C.F.R. §681.2.
The Program was developed with the oversight and approval of the Organization’s [Board of
Directors/Managing Partner/Managing Member] who has determined that our Organization is a
Creditor with Covered Accounts (as defined below) and is obligated to comply with the Rule. After
due consideration of the Rule’s requirements and its guidelines, and of the size and complexity of the
Organization’s operations and systems, and the nature and scope of the Organization’s activities, the
[Board/Managing Partner/Managing Member] determined that this Program is reasonable and
appropriate for the Organization.

Policy:
The Identity Theft Prevention Program Policy provides guidelines to follow to prevent or eliminate the
risk for Identity Theft of Cook County Health and Hospitals System patients. The policy also provides
instructions for addressing incidents of Identity Theft or potential Identity Theft events.

Definitions:
A. Definitions of Terms used in the Program
1. Identity Theft is fraud committed using the identifying information of another person,
which can be medical identity theft and/or financial identity theft.
2. A Creditor is any person or entity who:
i. regularly extends, renews or continues credit;
ii. regularly arranges for the extension, renewal or continuation of credit;
or
iii. any assignee of an original creditor who participates in the decision to
extend, renew or continue credit.
3. A Covered Account is:
i. an account that a creditor offers or maintains, primarily for personal,
family or household purposes, that involves or is designed to permit
multiple payments or transactions; and
ii. any other account that the creditor offers or maintains for which there
is a reasonably foreseeable risk to patients or to the safety and
soundness of the creditor from Identity Theft.
4. Because our Organization regularly extends credit to patients by establishing an
account that permits multiple payments, our Organization is a Creditor offering
Covered Accounts. Commentary to the Rule states that “creditors in the
health care field may be at risk of medical identity theft (i.e., identity theft
for the purpose of obtaining medical services) and, therefore, must identify
Red Flags that reflect this risk.”
5. Identifying Information is defined under the Rule as any name or number that
may be used, alone or in conjunction with any other information, to identify a
specific person, including name, address, telephone number, social security
number, date of birth, government-issued driver’s license or identification
number, alien registration number, government passport number, employer or
taxpayer identification number, unique electronic identification number,
computer’s Internal Protocol Address, or routing code.

further prevent the likelihood of Identity Theft occurring with respect to
the Organizations accounts.
D. Program Updates
The Program Administrator will periodically review and update this Program
to reflect changes in risks to patients and the soundness of the Organization in
protecting against Identity Theft, taking into consideration the Organization’s
experience with Identity Theft occurrences, changes in methods of how
Identity Theft is being perpetrated, changes in methods of detecting,
preventing and mitigating Identity Theft, changes in the types of accounts the
Organization offers, and changes in the Organization’s business relationships with other
entities. After considering these factors, the Program Administrator will
determine whether changes to the Program are warranted. The Program
Administrator will present any recommended changes to the [Board/Managing
Partner/Managing Member], which will make a determination whether to
accept, modify or reject the recommended changes to the Program.

Procedures:
Emergency Room Patients:
In order to adhere to EMTALA guidelines, patients will not be asked to make payment on ER
copayments/deductibles until they have been triaged and a full registration has been completed. EMTALA
guidelines require the patient be assessed/triaged and stabilized prior to any payment arrangements being
discussed with the patient.
1. As part of the discharge process, registration associates will review the patient’s insurance card to
determine the appropriate ER copayment/deductible owed. Most insurance cards specify an ER
copayment/deductible amount. However, in the event there is no specified ER copayment listed on the
insurance card, the registration associate will attempt to validate whether or not a copayment is
required by making a phone call to the insurance carrier or by prompting and validating against the
electronic eligibility response. If it is determined there is a copayment required but no amount is
specified, the registrar will request an estimated ER copayment from the patient in the amount of $50.
2. The registration associate will ask the patient for their preferred method of payment (credit card, check,
or cash).
3. If the patient chooses to pay by credit card, the registration associate will process the payment and
issue the patient the credit card receipt produced by the credit card machine. The payment will be
entered into the cash log and the merchant receipt will be stapled to a copy of the face sheet and
placed in the Patient Access safe.
4. If the patient chooses to make payment in cash or check, the registration associate will collect the
payment, enter it into the cash log and write out a receipt for the patient using the appropriate receipts
issued by the cashier. The registration associate must then staple a copy of the face sheet and receipt
to the payment and place it in the Patient Access safe.
5. All Credit Card, Cash, and check payments must be logged into the Cash Receipt Record before the
next patient is registered. When logging payments into the Cash Receipt record, registration associates
must include the date of the payment, patient name, account #, amount received, initials of the person
receiving the payment, receipt number, and method of payment.
6. All Credit Card, Cash or check payments must be placed in the safe with a copy of the receipt and face
sheet.
7. For uninsured or underinsured patients, If the patient states they cannot make full or partial payment,
they will be referred to a Financial Counselor to be screened for other financial arrangements. The
registration associate will follow the appropriate referral process as specified by Patient Financial
Services.
Central Registration Area - Outpatients:
Copayments, deductibles, and coinsurances, will be determined during the pre-registration process for all
scheduled outpatients services when benefits are confirmed with the insurance company. Patients will be
advised prior to their arrival of the expected payment on the scheduled date of service. The required
payment will be noted on the patient’s pre-registration documentation.
1. The registration associate will ask the patient for their preferred method of payment (credit card, check,
or cash).
2. If the patient chooses to pay by credit card, the registration associate will process the payment and
issue the patient the credit card receipt produced by the credit card machine. The payment will be

5. All Credit Card, Cash or Check payments must be placed in the safe with a copy of the receipt and face
sheet.
6. Patients pre-registered for elective services will be notified of their out-of-pocket responsibility prior to
their arrival date. The patient will be required to bring their payment with them when they arrive for
services.
7. For uninsured or underinsured patients, if the patient states they cannot make full or partial payment,
they will be referred to a Financial Counselor to be screened for other financial arrangements. The
registration associate will follow the appropriate referral process as specified by Patient Financial
Services.
8. Patients with no insurance coverage that have failed to make adequate payment arrangements will be
screened by a Financial Counselor for eligibility of financial assistance programs or payment
arrangements prior to services being authorized. Elective services may be delayed or postponed if a
patient has not completed all requirements into one of the Medical Assistance programs offered by
CCHHS or made acceptable payment arrangements. Urgent/Stat orders will be approved for services
and monitored closely for compliance with the Financial Clearance policy.
Inpatients (ER Admissions & Direct Admissions):
The Insurance Verifier will obtain full pre-certification, benefits, and eligibility information within 24 hours of
admission to determine whether a patient is responsible for a deductible or coinsurance related to the

safes will be limited to the Patient Access Director, Manager, and Supervisors.
Patient Cash Collection and Registration Script:
It is important to maintain professionalism and consistency when requesting payment for services. Please
use the following script as a helpful tool in approaching patients for payment:

Sample Script for Registration Associates
Patient/guarantor arrives in emergency/outpatient department area:
Registration Associate: Good morning/afternoon (applicable title and name). Thank you (name of care professional if
patient was escorted). My name is _______, and I am a registration associate here at (name of hospital). I'm sorry if an
emergency brought you here today, and I hope things are better now. Let me explain quickly what we will be doing. Is
that OK?
If patient answers no:
Registration Associate: What may I help you with before we go on?
Based on the response, it may be necessary to reconnect with the care professional or allow the patient some time to
take care of some immediate need, e.g., go to the restroom, get a beverage, hand off a child.
If patient answers yes:
Registration Associate: I just need to review some of the information you have provided. We want to be sure we have
complete and accurate information to file a claim with your insurance company. Let's go over this quickly, and please
feel free to interrupt me if you don't understand something or if we have recorded something incorrectly. Does all of that
sound OK to you?
1. If patient is insured, registration associate reviews guarantor information and insurance information.
Registration Associate: Great. Then let's move on. We will file an insurance claim with your insurance plan within the
next 72 hours, and they should process and pay your claim within 30 days. You will receive a statement from us if your
insurance company delays payment; thus, you will be aware of our progress with your insurance company. If there is an
excessive delay, you may trust that we will contact you to assist us in getting your claim resolved to your satisfaction.

Purpose:
The purpose of this policy is to provide guidance and instruction for the implementation of Quality Assurance
(QA), standards/guidelines for patient registration accuracy. This policy is specific to collecting quality data
captured by registrars at the time of pre-registration and registration. Quality Assurance must be performed to
ensure the highest degree of data integrity through timely collection of patient information. Failure to obtain
accurate information during the intake process puts the facility at risk for inappropriate billing. Patient
registration errors can result in lost revenue; partial or full denials, significant rework, dissatisfied patients and
can be an overall compliance issue. The CCHHS Patient Access and Training & Development Department is
responsible for maintaining this policy and procedure to reduce the number of registration errors and improve
the clean claim rate and patient billing experience.

Scope:
This policy and procedure will pertain to all Cook County Health and Hospital’s Systems entities and those
departments and associated staff capturing patient data for the purpose of creating a registration or preregistration within Cerner.

Policy:
The Patient Registration Quality Assurance (QA) policy is defined as the process through which a variety of
different data sets within the calendar year will be reviewed and audited by trainers, supervisors, management
and/or designees. A scoring system will be used with standard parameters to identify and rate registration
errors and overall registration accuracy. All CCHHS affiliates will be required to rate above a goal of 98%
accuracy for scheduled visits or admissions and 96% for unscheduled visits or admissions. A baseline should
be determined for the current quality rating and operational performance in order to track future performance
relative to a quality initiative start date.
Patient Access is also responsible for assisting in the appeal process if a denial is related to front end
registration data capture. These denials are referred to as technical or administrative denials. A strong QA
program eliminates repetitive errors by continuous quality auditing, education and training of management and
staff.

Procedures:
1. Define the data elements or data sets to be tracked (refer to QA Worksheet) and the frequency of
tracking. Data sets should be tracked weekly for each registrar using a combination of results from the
Registration Accuracy automated tool and manual sampling. Quality Review Forms can be completed
for specific examples of errors in order to communicate and re-educate registrars committing the errors.
2. After completion of the Quality Review form, a duplicate of the detailed form will be distributed to each
employee and will be initialed by the employee upon receipt and review of the error with the trainer or
direct supervisor. (see Quality Review form).
3. The Registration Quality Weekly Summary is used to track employee errors only and maintain weekly
quality % scores as a ratio to total registrations completed by each registrar.
4. A Quality Trending Report will score and track percentage of accuracy and compare it to the goal for
each Patient Access team. An employee’s QA score is totaled weekly and included in the average for
the weekly calculation of the Patient Access team. Each month is tracked and compared to the yearly
average which should be used for employee annual reviews and the departmental annual accuracy
percentages.
5. Select accounts from the Daily Registration Error Report available on the automated Registration
Accuracy Tool that identifies all accounts in the system that have been registered and identified to have
an error. The accuracy percentage should be calculated for each registrar as a ratio of total
registrations with errors divided by total registrations.
6. Collect all paperwork affiliated with the account selection such as physician order, faxed information
from physician office, etc. These items we’ll be manually reviewed for accuracy and comparison to data
captured within Cerner.
7. Bring up the QA data elements to be audited in the Cerner System.
8. Review all other data elements for accuracy that may not be detected by the automated accuracy tool
by reviewing the account in Cerner. All forms related to the account should also be reviewed.
Consistent development of the automated registration accuracy tool may occur to capture all detectible
errors where reasonable.
9. A copy of each error should be retained by the trainer/supervisor to support the QA Worksheet and/or
summary of errors.
10. The number of errors should be indicated for each employee.
11. Once the selected accounts are reviewed, repeat for the next employee until the weekly process is
complete for each employee within your department.
12. Errors should be totaled on the QA Worksheet and a QA percentage is applied based on results.

13. At the end of the weekly QA audit, results will be shared with staff. At the end of the month, each
employee will participate in a brief meeting with management to discuss QA results and an education
plan for areas where the employees has repetitive errors. One-on-one re-training with the individual
employee regarding their errors should have occurred prior to the monthly meeting or shortly thereafter.
14. Repeat the process for all applicable employees performing registration functions.

Procedures:
A. All requests to schedule new services begin with a completed referral in the IRIS system. The
referral will specify the ordering physician and information, diagnosis, completed pre-requisite
requirements, and valid patient contact and insurance information. Specified High-Dollar
referrals will be reviewed by nursing staff for appropriate use of clinical resources and services
before an appointment is scheduled. All other services will be scheduled in an available
appointment appropriate for the patient availability request.
B. Once the appointment is scheduled the automated appointment acknowledgement system will
place a call to the patient or guarantor to confirm, decline, or re-schedule their appointment.
Patients must be told at the time their referral decision is made that they must complete one of
the three options or their appointment will be cancelled.
C. The IRIS referral system will detect invalid contact information and the scheduler will:
a. Contact the ordering physician’s office to obtain the accurate patient’s phone number if
a valid number is not already available in the Patient Management System from
historical visits.
b. A patient’s appointment will not be scheduled if inaccurate contact information is
obtained.
D. If the automated system detects an answering machine, a brief message will be left with a
return number to call for the patient to confirm, decline, or reschedule their appointment.
E. The Pre-Registration/Scheduling Unit will answer all requests to reschedule a patients
appointment and will identify a suitable appointment for the patient. A pre-registration will be
performed while the patient is on the phone. (Refer to the Pre-Registration Policy for details).
F. Confirmed appointments will be directly routed to the pre-registration unit as part of the
automated call process.
G. For those departments that do not process referrals for services through the IRIS system or

Policy

Core Policy

Pages:

Purpose:
Patients who are minors have the right to treatment under specific guidelines to obtain appropriate
consent. Consent to treat a minor should usually be obtained from a parent or guardian, however,
that is not necessarily the case under specific circumstances.
The purpose of the following policy is to provide all admission and outpatient treatment areas with a
clear guideline of obtaining a valid consent for the treatment of minors and ensuring compliance.

Scope:
This policy and procedure will pertain to all Cook County Health and Hospital system entities that
provide treatment, diagnostic services, or preventive patient services to minors. This policy is in
alignment with Illinois State Family Law Chapter 750; Sections 30-1 thru 30-11 (Also referred to as
the Emancipation of Minors Act).

Policy:
The “Consent for Treatment of a Minor” policy is defined to ensure that proper written or verbal
consent is obtained for minor’s with legal guardians/parents, emancipated minors, or minors seeking
specific types of services.

Approved By:

Date:

Page 1 of 3

 96

Procedures:

A. Cook County Health and Hospitals System requires that all minors requesting medical
treatment in any of its entities have a parent or legal guardian provide written consent except in
the following instances as required by law:
a.
b.
c.
d.
e.
f.
g.

A minor that has been deemed emancipated by a court order.
A minor considered emancipated through marriage
A minor seeking diagnosis, treatment, or prevention of pregnancy
A minor seeking diagnosis, treatment, or prevention of a sexually transmitted condition
A minor seeking treatment for a sexual assault
A minor seeking treatment for alcohol or drug abuse
A minor that is requiring or seeking treatment related to his/her mental health

It is important to remember that a minor can only be deemed emancipated in the State of
Illinois from the age of 16 until the time they turn 18 years old. Minors younger than 16 years of
age cannot be considered emancipated and are always considered to be under the custody of
an authorized parent/guardian that can provide consent to treat the minor. It is also important
to remember that children in the custody of DYFS (Division of Family and Youth Services) are
never considered emancipated.
Please adhere to the following policy for minors that require a parent or legal guardian provide
consent for treatment:
B. As a general rule, an unemancipated minor’s consent to treatment is not valid, and the consent
of a parent or legal guardian must be obtained before treatment is rendered unless specified in
section A. The informed consent process, which includes a thorough discussion between the
care provider and the patient, together with written documentation of that discussion, should be
undertaken prior to procedures. In the case of a minor, the informed consent process must
also involve the parent or legal guardian. The informed consent process need not be as
detailed for routine diagnostic and treatment measures, compared with the technical specificity
that more complex procedures demand. However, the patient must be advised about all
treatment and diagnostic procedures with respect to the proposed treatment plan, including
what is to be done and why. The patient does have a right to refuse even the most routine
treatment.
C. In the case of an unemancipated minor, unaccompanied by a parent or legal guardian, the
physician should use his/her professional judgment as to whether any delay in treatment will
likely be detrimental to the minor patient’s systemic health. The physician will decide whether it
is in the patient’s best interest to proceed with the treatment immediately, or whether treatment
can wait until a parent or legal guardian can be contacted.
D. Next, make a reasonable effort to contact the parent or legal guardian. To that end, patient
charts/electronic records should be updated with all parent/guardian contact information. The
record and patient management system should contain documentation of all attempts to reach
a parent or guardian.
Page 2 of 3

 97
E. If you cannot reach a parent or guardian, the physician will decide to defer routine treatment
or, if necessary, to palliate the patient’s condition until a parent or guardian’s informed consent
can be obtained. Generally, it is acceptable to intervene without parental consent when
immediate intervention is warranted due to traumatic injury or other truly emergent conditions
but it is critical that the physician make that decision, NOT a Patient Access staff member.
F. The verbal consent or signature on a consent form of one parent is adequate. However, it is
essential that the parent/guardian granting consent is legally authorized to do so. Divorces can
often be highly contentious, to the point where some divorce decrees have stipulated that a
non-custodial parent be stripped of parental rights. If a natural parent has no parental rights,
that individual is precluded from granting consent on behalf of his or her child. Ensure that you
have obtained the consent signature from the parent that can legally authorize the treatment
for the minor. The right to legally grant consent for a minor child is independent of any financial
obligations or arrangements that may have been made during divorce proceedings.
Consequently, the parent paying the medical fees may or may not be legally authorized to
grant consent. A copy of a divorce decree is required in the event it is unclear who is legally
authorized to provide consent for a child of divorced parents. A copy of the court order is also
required for guardians other than the patients parents that are authorized to provide consent
for the minor patient.
G. Occasionally, a minor patient will be accompanied by a relative other than the parent or
guardian authorized to provide consent for treatment. It is important that written consent be
obtained by the authorized parent/guardian before the patient receives treatment unless the
services are of such an emergent nature that only the physician decides to treat the patient.
Refer to section E regarding a physician’s judgment to treat a minor patient.
H. If an unaccompanied minor child presents for treatment it is NOT permissible to proceed with
treatment unless the physician has determined it is of such emergent nature that not providing
treatment would be detrimental to the patient’s health. It is only permissible to proceed with
treatment for this reason or the reasons stated in section A.
