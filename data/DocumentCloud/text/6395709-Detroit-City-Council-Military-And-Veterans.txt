DETROIT CITY COUNCIL 

DETROIT KETTERING HIGH SCHOOL CLASS OF 1969
?In Recognition of Your 5 Class Reunion 

WHEREAS: On September 21, 2019 Kettering High School (KE) Class of 1969 will celebrate its 50th class
reunion. This is a milestone we celebrate with great pride. In the 50 years since the KB Class of 1969
graced Kettering?s hallways, the world has changed more dramatically than we could ever have
imagined. The KE Class of 1969 began their public school education on the heels of Brown vs Board
of Education, the 1954 Supreme Court landmark ruling that made segregated public schools illegal;
and

WHEREAS, Kettering High School opened in 1965, a new high school for Detroit. The site selected for Kettering
High School was the Detroit?s Board of Education attempt to address both overpopulation in Detroit?s
High Schools and segregation in Detroit?s schools. Located on Van Dyke and the I-94 interchange,
Kettering High School was zoned to bring students from the black community (who lived south of I-
94) together with students from the white community (who lived north of resulting in Kettering
being an integrated school in 1965. The KE Class of 1969 represented a future of equal opportunities
for African Americans. As direct bene?ciaries of the Civil Rights Movement, the KB Class of 1969
gained access to opportunities and careers that were not open to their parents due to racism; and

WHERE AS, The KE Class of 1969 survived very turbulent times, including the 1967 Detroit Rebellion, downward
spiral of the automotive industry, the Vietnam War, and the in?ux of narcotics in their communities.
These events took a toll on the Kettering community-at-large. This September, we celebrate the
Kettering High School Class of 1969 with a 50th class reunion. It is a bittersweet moment, as we re?ect
on the classmates who are no longer with us. Additional it saddens us that Kettering permanently closed
in 2012 and the school building is slated for demolition in the very near future; and

WHEREAS, We will take the PIONEER SPIRIT with us into the future. That as true PIONEERS, we will continue
to support efforts needed to ensure Civil Rights are not compromised that were cultivated by the Civil
Rights Movement. That as PIONEERS, we chartered new territories in education, the military,
manufacturing, government, entertainment, health care, and business. That although they may tear
down Kettering High School?s building, they will never destroy the PIONEER SPIRIT. That the
Kettering High School?s PIONEER SPIRIT will live on in the hearts and minds of every PIONEER.
That the KB Class of 1969 has survived; and 50 years we are the ULTIMATE 
NOW, THEREFORE BE IT

RESOLVED, That the DETROIT CITY COUNCIL and of?ce of COUNCIL PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE MARY
SHEFFIELD, wishes to take this Opportunity to honor and recognize the Kettering High School Class of
1969?s 50?] Class Reunion!
