WHEREAS, the City of Chicago, the County of Cook, and many other public and private entities,
currently recognize an identification card issued by the Mexican Consulate, known as a Matricula
Consular, as a legal form of identification; and
WHEREAS, the Mexican Consulate requires sufficient confirmation of a person's identity before issuing
a Matricula Consular card and the card contains several security features designed to prevent

WHEREAS, Cook County should also recognize the Matricula Consular cards of other Latin American
consulates who create an identification card system that meets the high standards of security established

WHEREAS, the acceptance of Matricula Consular cards as valid forms of identification increases our
sense of security and our ability to protect the public health and safety of all of the residents of Cook

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, BY THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF COOK
COUNTY:
Section 1. The Matricula Consular Ordinance, (02-0-27), amending Chapter 5, Departments and
Agencies, General Provisions, of the Ordinances & Resolutions of Cook County is hereby amended by
inserting the language underscored as follows:
CHAPTER 5-4 IDENTIFICATION CARDS

ill Recognition of Matricula Consular as valid identification. When requiring members of the
public to provide identification, each County department shall accept as valid identification of the person
a "Matricula Consular" identification card issued by the Mexican Consulate.
(b) Recognition of other Matricula Consular as valid identification. When requiring members of
the public to provide identification, each County department shall accept as valid identification of the
person a " Matricula Consular" identification card issued by any other Latin American country that is
represented by a consulate office in Cook County, to its citizens or nationals if the issuing country's
consulate has certified that the identification card meets the following security requirements:

(i)
(ii)
(iii)
(iv)

The issuing country authorizes the use of the card as an alternative to a passport for re-entry
into the issuing country; and
the card holder was required to provide proof of identity, nationality, and address in order
to obtain the card; and
the card has a photograph of the person and the person's date of birth; and
the card has physical security features reasonably designed to protect against fraud and
counterfeit reproduction, including the use of bonded paper, lamination, a hologram, an
embedded signature of the issuing officer, and serialization.

(c) The Chief Administrative Officer ("Officer") shall compile and make available to County
departments a list of the identification cards and the issuing countries that have been determined to meet
the requirements of this section.

161

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 17, 2002

!.Ql The requirements of this section do not apply under circumstances where ( I) a federal or
state statute, administrative regulation or directive, or court decision requires the County to obtain
different identification, (2) a federal or state statute or administrative regulation or directive preempts
local regulation of identification requirements, or (3) the County would be unable to comply with a
condition imposed by a funding source, which would cause the County to lose funds from that source.

ill Nothing in this section is intended to prohibit the County department from (I) asking for
additional infonnation from individuals in order to verify a current address or other facts that would
enable the department to fulfill its responsibilities, except that this section does not pennit the department
to require additional information solely because the Matricula Consular is the fonn of identification
presented, (2) using fingerprints for identification purposes under circumstances where the department
also requires fingerprints from persons who have a driver's license or State identification card.
Section 2. This ordinance shall take effect immediately upon approval.
Commissioner Hansen, seconded by Commissioner Daley, moved to suspend the rules so that this matter
may be considered. The motion carried unanimously.

OFFICE OF THE CHIEF JUDGE
GRANT AWARD
Transmitting a Communication, dated November 27, 2002 from
TIMOTHY C. EVANS, Chief Judge, Circuit Court of Cook County
requesting authorization to accept second-year grant funding in the amount of $300,000.00 from the
Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority (ICJIA). This grant will fund Multi-Systemic Therapy
(MST) services to delinquent minors identified by the court to be in need of clinical intervention. The
grant succeeds the current grant which expired September 30, 2002.
Through the combined use of well-known therapeutic techniques such as cognitive behavior therapy,
MST addresses complex issues faced by multi-need families. Intensive MST clinical interventions target
the fami ly as the client rather than the individual minor. MST clinicians provide therapeutic services for
minors between the ages of 12 and 17 who have been diagnosed with mental health disorders, thereby
helping reduce the number of minors placed in expensive residential treatment facilities by allowing
minors to remain in their communities without compromising public safety.
Consistent with last year, grant funds will be used to pay for therapeutic services provided by Hartgrove
Hospital, travel by staff, computers and telecommunications equipment, and office supplies.
This grant did not require a written application. As such, prior approval by the Cook County Board was
not required.
The grant requires cash matching funds from Cook County in the amount of $100,000.00.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: $100,000.00. Grant Award: $300,000.00. Funding period: November l , 2002
through October 3 1, 2003. (326-249 Account).

Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Committee on Finance of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County met pursuant to notice fo r a
public hearing on Thursday, December 5, 2002 at the hour of 10:30 A.M. in the Board Room, Room 569,
County Building, 11 8 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois, to explain the 2003 Proposed Property Tax
Levy for the County of Cook and receive public testimony regarding said proposed tax levy.
Chainnan Daley stated the State legislature enacted the Cook County Truth in Taxation Act that requires
taxing districts to disclose by publication and to hold a public hearing on their intention to adopt a tax
levy. The Act provides that a notice of intention to adopt a proposed property tax levy and the
designation of a time and place for a public hearing be published in a newspaper of general circulation
within the taxing district.
Chainnan Daley further stated that in accordance with the Truth in Taxation Act, the date of the public
hearing shall be the first Thursday in December, which is today.
Sandra Williams, Secretary to the Board, stated the notice for this public hearing was published in the
fonn required under the law, in the Chicago Sun-Times on Monday, November 25, 2002.
Chainnan Daley asked the Secretary to read the notice into the record. (The referenced documents are on
file in the Office of the County Clerk.)

222

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 17, 2002

Chairman Daley called upon the Chief Financial Officer, Tom Glaser, to explain the 2003 proposed
property tax levy.
Mr. Glaser gave an overview of the tax levy by fund, as reflected in the executive budget summary charts.
He referenced the seventh page of charts, which shows a history of the property tax levy going back to
1995 when President Stroger took office. He commented that the overall property tax levy has been held
constant with the 2003 proposed budget at $720.5 million for the fourth consecutive year. He stated the
property tax levy has slightly increased from $71 1 million in 1995 to $720.5 million in 2003, however
abatements have been done over that time period. As a result, the overall levy has essentially remained
flat over the last e ight years.
Chairman Daley asked the Secretary if requests from members of the public indicating a desire to be
heard at this public hearing had been received.
The Secretary stated that one individual, Mr. William E. Kyle, a concerned citizen, had registered to
testify. The Secretary proceeded to call Mr. Kyle.
Hearing no response from Mr. Kyle, the Chairman asked if anyone present wished to testify. Hearing
none, Chairman Daley then returned to the Commissioners for questions.
In response to Commissioner Claypool's question regarding if there would be a vote taken, Chairman
Daley clarified that a vote will not be taken and that the meeting is a public hearing.
In response to Commissioner Peraica's request, Grace Colbert, Budget Director gave an overview of the
budget. Ms. Colbert also clarified the revenue figure is inclusive of all fee revenue.
In response to Commissioner Peraica's remark regarding a potential budget deficit, John Chambers,
County Comptroller, stated that by law, the county is required to present and approve a balanced budget,
so there is no deficit in the 2003 budget.
He further stated that 2003 revenue estimates include aggregate fee income from all sources. Fee revenue
is higher due to successful efforts by the Bureau of Health Services to maximize state and federal
reimbursements, collections from third party payers, insurance companies, and individuals. Mr.
Chambers also gave an overview of general operating funds, special revenue funds, home rule taxes and
grants. Mr. Chambers agreed to provide all new commissioners with a copy of the Revenue Estimate
book.
In response to Commissioner Peraica's question regarding the Village of Rosemont, President Stroger
stated that he would ask the State' s Attorney 's O ffice for a status update regarding the litigation.
Chainnan Daley stated that every commissioner should receive a copy of the status report.

Commissioner Sims moved to adjourn the meeting, seconded by Commissioner Maldonado. The
motion carried and the meeting was adjourned.

256335

REAL ESTATE MANAGEMENT DIVISION, by John W. Davis, Director, transmitting a
Communication, dated November 20, 2002:
On December 18, 200 l , the Board of Commissioners approved a lease (the " Lease") for use
by the Adult Probation Department of 4,437 square feet (the "Premises") to be constructed on
the second floor of an existing building. The landlord is Atlantic Mall Corporation (the
"Landlord") and the building is located at 3934 West 26th Street, Chicago, lllinois.
The Lease provides that the term of the Lease will commence 14 days after substantial
completion, estimated to occur on April 1, 2002. The Lease also gives the Tenant the right to
terminate the Lease if the premises are not substantially complete by December 18, 2002, one
year after approval of the Lease. However, if the Landlord substantially completes the
Premises during the thirty days after notice is given, the termination is null and void.
While awaiting delivery of the Premises, the Adult Probation Department is occupying space
on the first floor of the building (the "Temporary Premises") on a month-to-month lease
approved by the Board on December 18, 2001.
The Premises has not been substantially completed and, in fact, appears to be some weeks
away from completion. Further, the Adult Probation Department has concerns regarding
maintenance of the Temporary Premises that have not been adequately addressed by the
Landlord. Representatives of the Adult Probation Department have requested that the County
tenninate the Lease in accordance with its tenns, and exercise the right to terminate the
Temporary Premises lease on 30 days notice. Staff currently occupying the Temporary
Premises will be relocated to existing locations.
Based upon the foregoing, respectfully requesting authority to serve the thirty (30) days
tennination notice under the Lease, to terminate the Temporary Lease, and to serve any other
notices and take any other actions necessary to effectuate such tenninations.

*Referred to the Finance Real Estate Subcommittee on 12/3/02.
