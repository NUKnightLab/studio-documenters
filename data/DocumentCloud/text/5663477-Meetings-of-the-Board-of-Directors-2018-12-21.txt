 Total Population
Cook County
As seen nationally, Cook County is experiencing
three main trends that characterize the big

changes in American suburbia:*

1. Return migration and black suburbanization
2. Suburban immigrant destinations
3. Suburbanization of poverty

*The New Sociology of Suburbs: A Research Agenda for Analysis of Emerging Trends,” published in Annual Review of
Sociology, July 2016.

4

 Return Migration and
Black Suburbanization
Cook County is experiencing what some call
“reverse migration” with African Americans
leaving urban areas for the suburbs.

The African American population in
Chicago decreased by over 15% with a
similar increase in Suburban Cook
County.

5

 Return Migration and
Black Suburbanization
Adding to the reverse migration phenomenon –
“white flight” is also occurring with whites
returning to the urban centers. Overall, there has
been a 10% decrease of white populations in Cook
County. However, the population loss is not
consistent across the area. Suburban Cook County
had more than double the decrease in NH White
populations (14%) compared to Chicago with 6%.

6

 Suburban Immigrant
Destinations
Cook County, as most of the nation, saw an
increase in Hispanic populations. However, this
increase was greatest in Suburban Cook County
(over 50% increase).

7

 Suburbanization of poverty
While Chicago saw very little change in poverty and
even experienced an 2% decrease in child poverty,
Suburban Cook County (SCC ) saw dramatic rises in
its poverty levels.

Vulnerable Populations
Communities in the west and the south
have the highest vulnerability scores
Social Vulnerability Index* - demographic
and socioeconomic factors that affect the
resilience of communities

Composed of indicators from the following
domains:
1) Socioeconomic status
2) Household composition and disability
3) Minority status and language

4) Housing and transportation

11

 Child Opportunity Index (COI)
The Child Opportunity Index is a composite measure
of neighborhood-based opportunities, at the census
tract level, that influence children’s health and
development. The index includes measures in three
domains of neighborhood opportunity:
•

Educational opportunities (e.g., quality early
childhood education)

•

Health and environmental opportunities
(e.g., availability of healthy food), and social and

•

Economic opportunities (e.g., low poverty).
*Chicago-Joliet-Naperville , IL-IN -W I (Metro Area)
**data and maps courtesy of diversity datakids.org & the Kirwan Institute

12

 Racial/Ethnic Inequities in
Neighborhood Opportunities
Racist housing and labor markets have resulted in high
levels of residential segregation creating inequities in
neighborhood opportunities.

Children of color are disproportionately distributed
among neighborhoods with very low opportunity. Over 50
percent of black and 31 percent of Hispanic children live in
very low-opportunity neighborhoods in Cook County.

13

 Life Expectancy at Birth
by Census Tract
Large geographic inequalities in life expectancy
range from 60 years in Englewood to 90 years for a
census tract Chicago’s Near North Side.

 Medically Underserved
Medically Underserved Areas (MUAs)
Designated places lacking adequate medical services
according to federal guidelines. The data is useful for
targeting areas for increased medical services.
Medically Underserved Populations (MUPs)
Some areas are underserving certain specific populations
(such as those with low-income, or non-English speakers)
and are designated as MUPs.
MU Population – Governor’s Exception

Additionally, the state’s governor (or other chief executive
officer of the state) can designate areas that lack medical
services in a particular area, these are labeled as
“Governor’s Exception.”

• Poverty and lack of opportunity drive health outcomes.
• Population shifts and changes may define future workforce and demands for care in vulnerable
populations.
• Who are the Cook County Health partners that will help to improve opportunities for Cook county
residents where they work, live, and play?
