THE COOK COUNTY BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS (PROPOSED
RESOLUTION). Submitting a Proposed Resolution sponsored by Larry
Suffredin, County Commissioner.
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, FY 1997 Amendment Number 75, approved and adopted by the
Board of Commissioners of Cook County, instituted positions of support staff

WHEREAS, FY 2005 Amendment Number 33, sponsored by Commissioners
Larry Suffredin and Forrest Claypool, which "reduces funding for open
positions to 9 months," and Amendment Number 35 sponsored by
Commissioners Larry Suffredin and Forrest Claypool, which "reduces funding
for open positions to 6 months," were both presented by the sponsors to the
Board for their approval with the intent to reduce personnel expenditures by
reducing funding for open positions; and
WHEREAS , certain members of the Board of Commissioners utilize contractual
services paid from monies transferred from their 110 Account to the 289
Account, in which case a person is not hired and employed by the County of
Cook, but is instead contracted to do a particular task related to the member's
office, and therefore the position from which the contractual services are paid is
depleted each year and was not intended to be considered open or vacant for
the purposes of Amendment Numbers 33 and 35;
NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of
Cook County declares that it did not intend that Amendment Numbers 33 and
35 apply to the Grade 016 positions of those Commissioners who in prior years
transferred the funds from the Grade 016-110 Account to the 289 Account
thereby depleting the funds in those Grade 016-110 Accounts; and further
directs that the Director of Budget & Management Services return any monies
taken pursuant to Amendment Numbers 33 and 35 from these Commissioners'
Grade 016 110 Accounts to transfer the amount by which the Grade 016
positions at issue were reduced from the 814 Account (Appropriation
Adjustments) into the 110 Account (Salaries and Wages of Regular
Employees) from these Grade 16 positions.

* Referred to the Committee on Finance as amended on 05/03/05.
** Deferred at the 05/09/05 Finance Committee meeting to 05/17/05.

*The next regularly scheduled meeting is presently set for Tuesday, June 7, 2005.
