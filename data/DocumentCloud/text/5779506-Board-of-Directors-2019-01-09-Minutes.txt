PROJECTS
Brush Park South: Brownfield Redevelopment Plan
Mr. Vosburg presented the Brownfield Plan for the Brush Park South project.
Project Introduction
Brush Park South Phase I MR LLC is the project developer (the “Developer”) for the Plan which
entails a comprehensive, mixed-use redevelopment of the site. The redevelopment, Brush Park
South, is planned to consist of three mixed-income apartments buildings that will include
approximately 149 apartments and 600 square feet of retail space. Approximately 58 apartments
will be rented as affordable apartments with rents restricted and otherwise subject to various
requirements to assure their occupancy by residents who satisfy affordable housing criteria.
Twenty-nine of the affordable units will use project-based vouchers through the Detroit Housing
Commission and the other 29 affordable units will use Low Income Housing Tax Credits. A portion
of the remainder of the Property will be used for parking that will remain in place indefinitely for
use by tenants of the new apartment buildings as well as additional parking that will be available

 until alternative, permanent alternative parking becomes available either on the east side of Brush
or at other locations. It is expected that the alternative parking will not be available for at least
several years.
The total investment is estimated to be $37 million. The Developer is requesting $5,273,310.00
in TIF reimbursement.
There will be 250 temporary construction jobs and 4-6 FTE jobs. The 250 temporary construction
jobs are expected to be created over a 2-year period once construction begins. The 4-6 FTE jobs
will be related to property management. An unknown number of jobs are expected to be created
by one or more businesses that located in the retail component of the project.
Property Subject to the Plan
The eligible property (the “Property”) consists of nine (9) parcels located in the Brush Park area,
west of Brush Street, north of Winder Street and south of the east-west alley between Adelaide
and Alfred Street from Brush Street to John R Street.
Basis of Eligibility
The Property is considered “eligible property” as defined by Act 381, Section 2 because (a) it was
previously utilized for a commercial purpose and/or public purpose; (b) it is located within the City
of Detroit, a qualified local governmental unit under Act 381; and (c) it is a facility under Part 201
due to the presence of metals, PNAs, PCBs soil and fill or adjacent and contiguous to a facility
and the development of the adjacent or contiguous parcels is estimated to increase the captured
taxable value of the remainder of the eligible property.
Eligible Activities and Projected Costs
The “eligible activities” that are intended to be carried out at the Property are considered “eligible
activities” as defined by Sec 2 of Act 381, because they include baseline environmental
assessment activities, due care activities, additional response activities, site preparation,
infrastructure improvements, development and preparation of a brownfield plan and work plan,
brownfield plan implementation and interest. The eligible activities and budgeted costs are
intended as part of the development of the Property and will be financed solely by the Developer.
The Authority is not responsible for any costs of eligible activities and will incur no debt. The
eligible activities are estimated to commence within 18 months of approval of the Plan and be
completed within 3 years after approval of the Michigan Strategic Fund work plan, if applicable,
or three years after execution of the Reimbursement Agreement.
Tax Increment Financing (TIF) Capture
The Developer desires to be reimbursed for the costs of eligible activities. Tax increment revenue
generated by the Property will be captured by the DBRA and used to reimburse the cost of the
eligible activities completed on the Property after approval of this Plan pursuant to the terms of a
Reimbursement Agreement with the DBRA.

$7,181,686.00

The actual cost of those eligible activities encompassed by this Plan that will qualify for
reimbursement from tax increment revenues of the DBRA from the Property shall be governed by
the terms of the Reimbursement Agreement.
Other Incentives
The Developer is seeking additional incentives, which will include local and/or state approval of
Commercial Rehabilitation Act (CRA) Tax Abatement, City of Detroit allocations of HUD Home
HOME & Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds, Low Income Housing Tax Credits
(LITHC), and Project-Based Vouchers (PBV) from the Detroit Housing Commission.
Attached for your review and approval is a resolution authorizing the Brush Park South Brownfield
Plan for submittal to the Community Advisory Committee for consideration and comment within
30 days of their receipt of the proposed Plan. In addition, it authorizes the President of the Detroit
Economic Growth Corporation or any person designated by him, as a representative of the DBRA,
to conduct a public hearing in the area to which the Proposed Plan applies within the next 30
days. This public hearing may be held jointly with any public hearing conducted by the Community
Advisory Committee.
Ms. Mays requested more information on the development team for the Project. Mr. Duczynski
stated that the Developer is Schostak Brothers & Company as a joint venture with John Rhea,
the contractor is Rockford Construction Company working as a joint venture with Jenkins
Construction Company, the architect is Hamilton Anderson Associates with the support of
consultants including Giffels as the civil engineer, and the local structural engineer is SDI.
Ms. Mays asked if the parcels included in the Plan are owned by the City of Detroit and were part
of a Request for Proposal process. Ms. Chavez confirmed that the parcels included in the Plan
are owned by the City of Detroit and were part of a Request for Proposal process.
Mr. George asked what the Developer’s commitment is to employing Detroit residents to work on
the Project. Mr. Duczynski stated that the Developer will work with the contractors to ensure that
at least 51% of workers are Detroit residents and 51% of contractors and subcontractors have
addresses in the City of Detroit.
Ms. Mays asked if the Project is still on track to begin construction in February 2019. Mr.
Duczynski stated that the Project is still on track and that the Developer will have construction
drawings by February 15, 2019 and expect to start construction on April 15, 2019 beginning with
the removal of soil.
Ms. Wilkins called for approval of the Brush Park South Brownfield Redevelopment Plan. The
