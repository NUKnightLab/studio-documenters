VOTEC CORPORATION (PROPOSED CONTRACT).
Transmitting a
Communication, dated September 12, 2012 from David Orr, County Clerk by Clem
Balanoff, Deputy County Clerk and Maria De Lourdes Coss, Chief Procurement Officer:
requesting authorization for the Chief Procurement Officer to enter into and execute a
contract with Votec Corporation, San Diego, California, for implementation of an
electronic poll book system.
Reason:

A Request for Proposal (RFP) was issued for electronic poll book and
software services (e-pollbook) via the Cook County website. Votec
Corporation offered the best value by meeting the requirements and offering
the best price. They have extensive experience with such implementations.
The e-pollbook is a software application residing on personal computing
hardware, built with data from the Cook County Election Division’s voter
database. The application will help ensure that, in all precincts, voters are
uniformly processed by election judges, and that voters who appear at the
wrong precinct can be directed to the correct polling location, thus
preventing disenfranchisement. Other benefits include expediting of voter
intake on election day and access to accurate, up-to-date voter history and
turnout data. In addition, e-pollbooks enable us to electronically capture
data from the polling place, including data on affidavit and provisional
voters, election judge timekeeping reports, statements of ballots and survey
information.
Further, the e-pollbook provides a two-way instant
communication platform with our office to help the judges better administer
the election. In addition to these benefits cost savings will be realized in the
following areas: printing, election morning deliveries of updated lists of
early/mail voters to each precinct, and personnel costs associated with
manually updating voter history post-election. The total contract amount is
funded in its entirety by Help America Vote Act (HAVA) and other grant
funds.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: None. Grant funded amount: $3,014,450.00 [$2,812,109.00 (619-818 Account); and $202,341.00 - (642-818 Account)]. Contract period: December 1,
2012 through November 30, 2014.
The Chief Procurement Officer concurs.
Vendor has met the Minority and Woman Business Enterprise Ordinance.
