RESOLUTION
Sponsored by
THE HONORABLE JOAN PATRICIA MURPHY AND DEBORAH SIMS
COUNTY COMMISSIONERS
A RESOLUTION RECOGNIZING PEER JURY PROGRAMS AND
THEIR IMPORTANCE TO THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM IN COOK COUNTY
WHEREAS, peer juries, also known as youth courts or teen courts, are one of the fastest growing crime
intervention and prevention programs in the nation; and
WHEREAS, peer juries offer young, first-time, nonviolent offenders who admit their guilt an
opportunity to be sentenced by their peers and receive a consequence that reflects the ideals of, and
educates the offenders in, restorative justice; and
WHEREAS, peer juries give young volunteers the chance to serve as jurors in a coordinated effort to
hold their peers accountable with balanced consequences that repair harm done to the victim, the
community, and to the offender himself or herself, and their family; and
WHEREAS, peer jury programs exemplify the practices of empowering youth through involvement in
community solutions, problem-solving, decision-making, leadership development, and positive peer
pressure; and
WHEREAS, youth courts increase the awareness of delinquency issues and problem behavior on a local
level and mobilize community members and youth to take an active role in addressing the problem; and
WHEREAS, Federal, State, and local governments, corporations, foundations, service organizations,
educational institutions, juvenile justice agencies, and individual adults support youth court programs
because such programs actively promote and contribute to building successful, productive lives and
futures for our youth; and

763

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 4, 2009
WHEREAS, community service and related service learning opportunities enable young people to build
character and to enhance and learn life skills, including responsibility, decision-making, time
management, teamwork, public speaking, and leadership, which are skills that prospective employers
value and which help to transform participants in youth court programs into productive members of their
communities; and
WHEREAS, peer jury programs build ties between the justice system, members of the community and
youth. Youth courts also build awareness in youth of the law and the consequences of delinquency, and
build a type of community where youth can contribute to society.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners recognizes
and commends the youth court programs in existence in Cook County, including, but not limited to the
Homewood Flossmoor Peer Jury Program, for the support and efforts of such programs in enhancing the
quality of the juvenile justice system in Cook County, and supports the purposes and practices of such
programs in improving such system; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a suitable copy of this Resolution be tendered to the Homewood
Flossmoor Peer Jury Program in recognition of its success and that this text be spread upon the official
proceedings of this Honorable Body.
Approved and adopted this 4th day of March 2009.

WHEREAS, the Baby Boomer generation, born between 1946 and 1964, is rapidly approaching
retirement. In 2006 the first Baby Boomers turned 60; and

764

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 4, 2009
WHEREAS, the number of Americans over the age of 65 is expected to double from the year 2000 to
2030 and the number of people over age sixty in the State of Illinois is projected to increase by 87% from
1,966,236 in 2000 to 3,676,295 in 2030 – 1 in every 5 Illinoisans; and
WHEREAS, this growth presents both enormous potential and new planning challenges for communities
and preparing for this growth requires coordinated action between multiple levels of government, the
aging network, businesses, social service providers, faith-based and community organizations, families,
and individuals; and
WHEREAS, a national survey of U.S. counties and cities found that in 2006 only 46% of communities
had started planning to address the needs of the growing number of older residents; and
WHEREAS, recognizing the need for communities to prepare for this growing segment of the
population, the Older Americans Act Amendments of 2006 authorized the Illinois Department on Aging
and the 13 Planning and Service Areas of Illinois including Age Options to assess the preparedness of
Illinois and our communities for the aging of the population and make recommendations to government
officials in the areas of health and human services, land use, housing, transportation, public safety,
workforce and economic development, recreation, education, civic engagement, and emergency
preparedness; and
WHEREAS, a joint resolution of the Illinois General Assembly directs that the Illinois Department on
Aging, the thirteen Area Agencies on Aging, and a statewide membership organization that advocates for
the needs of seniors, with the advice of the Illinois Council on Aging and the Older Adult Services
Advisory Committee, and in collaboration with other departments and offices of state government,
advocacy organizations on behalf of older adults, local units of government, and organizations in the
private sector, shall assess the preparedness of the State of Illinois and counties and communities within
the 13 Planning and Service Areas of Illinois for the aging of the population and shall submit a report
with recommendations for the planning and development of livable communities for all ages in Illinois to
the Illinois General Assembly, the Office of the Governor, and local officials by January 1, 2011; and
WHEREAS, Age Options will assess the preparedness of the Cook County suburban communities of

requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with CDW

Reason:

The Bureau of Technology's Active Directory network has grown significantly
since it was first designed and is in need of a reassessment to allow stable growth
for the future. An assessment will check for vulnerabilities and point out a

correcting them before they cause a problem will reduce the overall support costs
to maintain our network and provide a secure structure which will allow the
County to grow. Microsoft Premier support services are only performed by
Microsoft Corporation or its affiliates. CDW-G is an authorized affiliate of
Microsoft Services. CDW-G has been appointed by Microsoft Services to
perform the assessment.

DEPARTMENT OF OFFICE TECHNOLOGY
CONTRACT
Transmitting a Communication, dated February 10, 2009 from
ANTONIO HYLTON, Chief Information Officer, Bureau of Technology
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with Merrick & Company,
Aurora, Colorado, for aerial imagery for the Counties of Cook, DuPage, Kane, Kendall, Lake, McHenry
and Will. The seven county projects for aerial imagery includes ground control, aerial imagery (including
aerotriangulation), orthorectified imagery, DEM, geodatabase design, metadata, and project management.
This time-sensitive project is performed in the spring under "leaf-off" conditions.
Reason:

A regional Request for Proposal (RFP) was jointly developed by the Counties of Cook,
DuPage, Kane, Kendall, Lake, McHenry and Will (collectively "the regional GIS work
group") to select a company to perform aerial imagery for data acquisition and sharing at
county borders. The regional GIS work group has recommended Merrick & Company
because of its ability to meet all technical specifications of the RFP. Cook County, the
largest, most complex territory in the region, comprising dense urban areas, airports, and
shoreline environments, acts as the lead government project manager for this initiative. The
entities able to contribute financially to this project are the Counties of Cook, DuPage, Kane,
Kendall and Lake, and the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning. Beneficiaries of this
project are the Cook County municipalities that provide vital operations: emergency first
responders, emergency planners, remediation experts for homeland security, and emergency
management and disaster preparedness entities.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $1,280,907.74. Contract period: April 1, 2009 through July 31, 2010. (545260 Account). Requisition No. 95450009.
Sufficient funds are available in the Geographic Information Systems Fund.
Vendor has met the Minority and Women Business Enterprise Ordinance.

WHEREAS, Cook County has defined "abandoned property" as buildings and other structures that, after
having been vacant and unused for at least 24 months, are purchased for value by a purchaser in whom
the seller has no direct financial interest; and
WHEREAS, Cook County has defined an exception to this abandon property definition shall be, if the
City of Calumet City or the Board of Commissioners, finds that special circumstances justify finding that
the property is "abandoned" for purposes of Class 8; and
WHEREAS, in the case of abandonment of less than 24 months and purchase for value, by a purchaser in

WHEREAS, the City of Calumet City cites the special circumstances including, the redevelopment and
occupation of the abandoned property, will only occur if the Class 8 Tax Assessment is authorized in
order to overcome the special circumstances that are inherent to the property, which will continue to
thwart any viable redevelopment; the irregular size of the structures and their innate design flaws that
create an attractive nuisance to criminal elements; the aging and eroding of mechanical equipment within
the abandoned structures; the unkept and unsightly abandoned structures that have created a blighting
effect on surrounding residential neighborhoods, and the ongoing deterioration of the abandoned
structures that have an intrinsic chilling effect on the influx of potential commercial development within
the region.

RECOGNIZING MARCH 24, 2009 AS WORLD TB DAY
WHEREAS, the spread of tuberculosis continues to present a global public health threat, second only to
HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the world’s leading infectious killers; and
WHEREAS, tuberculosis is primarily an illness of the respiratory system that spreads by coughing and
sneezing. Each year, about two million people worldwide die from this curable disease; and
WHEREAS, with appropriate antibiotic treatment, TB can be cured in most people. Left untreated, each
person with active TB disease can infect an average of between 10 and 15 people every year; and
WHEREAS, successful treatment depends on close cooperation between the patient and health care
provider. Patients who stop taking their medication before they are cured remain ill and are at risk for
developing and spreading multi-drug resistant TB, a deadlier form of TB that is much more costly and
difficult to treat; and
WHEREAS, in suburban Cook County, treatment and control services are provided by the Cook County
Department of Public Health’s (CCDPH) TB Prevention and Control Unit; and
WHEREAS, an effective TB prevention and control program includes screening, early case
identification, contact tracing, and treatment. These are the services provided by the CCDPH that are so
essential to the prevention of costly TB outbreaks.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that I, Todd H. Stroger, President of the Cook County
Board of Commissioners, do hereby recognize the efforts of the Cook County Department of Public
Health to provide the services needed to control this disease and furthermore recognize March 24, 2009,
