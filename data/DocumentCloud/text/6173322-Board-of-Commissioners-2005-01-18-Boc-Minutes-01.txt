MINUTES OF THE REGULAR MEETING

OF THE

COMMISSIONERS OF THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY

JANUARY 18, 2005

The Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority held its Regular Meeting on Tuesday,
January 18, 2005, at 8:30 a.m. at Wentworth Gardens Fieldhouse, 3770 South Wentworth,
Chicago, Illinois.
The meeting was called to order by the Chairperson, and upon roll call, those present and absent
were as follows:
Present:
Sharon Gist Gilliam
Hallie Amey
Earnest Gates
Dr. Mildred Harris
Lori Healey
Michael Ivers
Carlos Ponce
Sandra Young
Mary Wiggins
Absent:

Martin Nesbitt

Also present were Terry Peterson, Chief Executive Officer; Gail Niemann, General Counsel;
Chicago Housing Authority Staff Members and the General Public.
There being a quorum present, the meeting duly convened and business was transacted as
follows:
Terry Peterson, Chief Executive Officer of the CHA then presented his report. Per Mr. Peterson,
the agenda this morning is light, but it’s no reflection of the broader agenda for the year ahead –
which is full of activity. Per Mr. Peterson, with the halfway point behind us and more than half
of the new units completed and occupied, the Plan for Transformation is proceeding. The CHA
expects to complete another 1400 units this year. Of these, approximately 300 will be new
construction and the rest will be rehabs. The big challenge CHA will face in the coming year is
not so much about getting units ready for residents as about getting residents ready for units in
new, mixed-income communities. In the new CHA, residents can no longer spend their life
without a job. They must pay their bills. They cannot house criminals. They cannot deface or
abuse their common areas. And property managers can no longer neglect the properties. Mr.
Peterson concluded his report by saying that the CHA Board and staff are prepared to do
whatever it takes to help residents succeed.

 The Chairperson then convened the Public Hearing portion of the meeting by inviting residents

The resolution for Item A1 approves award of contract to Fries Frame Productions for the
development and production of CHA’s cable television show “A Better Place.” In accordance
with the requirements sought, as outlined in the RFP, Fries Frame has extensive experience in
developing government informational programming. The show, in addition to being a primary
communications tool, is also serving as a conduit of information and inspiration to current
residents as it focuses on success stories resulting from the Plan for Transformation. Focus
groups with CHA residents and the general public, along with tracking information received
from call-ins, determined that the show is highly viewed and the information is being positively
received. Fries Frame has successfully provided the CHA with similar services for the past two
years.
RESOLUTION NO. 2005-CHA-3

negotiations with the Respondents and the established evaluation scoring criteria, the CHA

(Item A3)
The resolution for Item A3 approves an Intergovernmental Agreement with the City Department
of Fleet to allow the CHA to purchase fuel, car washes, road services, and towing and repair
services for CHA owned vehicles and heavy equipment used for official CHA business, while

to submit documentation regarding their licenses, qualifications, solvency, etc. to maintain their
