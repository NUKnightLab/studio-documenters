PROPOSED RESOLUTION

 ORGAN DONOR LEAVE POLICY
WHEREAS, the need for potentially life-saving organ and bone marrow transplants far exceeds the supply; and
WHEREAS, the State of Illinois has recognized the importance of organ donation by providing the opportunity
for paid leave to State employees who donate an organ or bone marrow; and
WHEREAS, like Illinois, many other jurisdictions have attempted to offset the incidental costs associated with
the donation and protect employees from retaliation for taking leave to donate an organ by passing legislation
providing job-protected, paid leave to employees who donate organs or bone marrow; and
WHEREAS, Cook County currently does not provide job-protected, paid leave for the purpose of organ or bone
marrow donation, necessitating employees to use their accrued sick and vacation leave or take unpaid personal
leave, if eligible; and
WHEREAS, in order to offset the incidental costs associated with donation and protect employees from
retaliation for taking a leave of absence to donate an organ, all Cook County agencies and offices should afford
paid leave to employees who donate organs or bone marrow; and
WHEREAS, the President’s Office and the Bureau of Human Resources have researched various organ donor leave
policies and as a result, the Bureau of Human Resources has developed an Organ Donor Leave Policy that will
provide job-protected, paid leave for the purpose of organ or bone marrow donation; and
WHEREAS, the proposed policy would be available to all eligible Cook County employees (employed with the
County for at least twelve (12) months) who donate organs or donate bone marrow via surgical aspiration or
non-surgical apheresis; and
WHEREAS, the risk of complications and death, as well as the burden to the donor in terms of recovery time, pain,
and suffering is lowest for apheresis donation and greatest for organ donation; and
WHEREAS, an eligible employee who donates bone marrow via non-surgical apheresis would receive five (5)
days of paid leave within a twelve (12) month period; and
WHEREAS, an eligible employee who donates bone marrow via surgical aspiration would receive fifteen (15)
days of paid leave within a twelve (12) month period; and
WHEREAS, an eligible employee who donates an organ would receive thirty (30) days of paid donor leave within
a twelve (12) month period; and
WHEREAS, an eligible employee that donates an organ as of January 1, 2015, that by necessity used their accrued
sick and vacation leave or took unpaid leave may recover that time under this policy but may not exceed the thirty
(30) days of paid donor leave within a twelve (12) month period; and
WHEREAS, the Bureau of Human Resources shall adopt and circulate the Organ Donor Leave Policy to all Cook
County agencies and offices as this policy will not only benefit our employees and their families but also the
County’s overall mission.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and Board of Commissioners of Cook County does
hereby direct the Chief of the Bureau of Human Resources to implement an Organ Donor Leave Policy with an
effective date of September 1, 2015; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that all Cook County agencies and offices receive a copy of the Organ Donor
Leave Policy issued by the Chief of the Bureau of Human Resources; and
