Dear Ryan Kattoo,

This correspondence serves as a follow up to our meeting on Thursday, October 3, 2019, at CNS
Healthcare?s clinic - at 15560 Joy Road, Detroit, Michigan 48228.

In that meeting, the CNS Healthcare (CNS) team made you aware that we are hosting three events,

during the next couple of months, including:

- CNS Healthcare?s 1St Annual Turkey Giveaway on Saturday, November 23, 2019. We will start
setting up at 8 am. The actual turkey giveaway will start at 11 am and ends when, CNS has given
away all 1,000 turkeys. We agreed to host the event directly in front of clinic and out into
the parking lot for approximately 50 50 square feet, which we will block off. Last Thursday,
you asked Allen from US Quality Super Market to come to facility and we discussed that
CNS is giving away 1,000 turkeys. Allen does not have a problem that CNS is giving away 1,000
free turkeys. You asked that CNS clean up once, the turkey give away is over, and we will do so.

>k . Ribbon Cutting Ceremony on Monday, December 9, 2019 from 10 am to noon. This event
will occur inside clinic. We are inviting elected officials, dignitaries, other guests and the
media. We agreed it is OK to tie a ribbon on the yellow posts in front of CNS, the ribbon we will

cut
*0 Open House Event on Monday, December 9, 2019 from 4 pm to 7 pm. This event will also
occur inside clinic. We are inviting elected officials, dignitaries and other guests.

Please let me know, If I captured your understanding about three upcoming events. If you have

questions and/or require clarifications, please advise.

Thank you in advance for your consideration in this matter.

Best,
af?x ?t

OSecond Blvd. and West Hancock block.

Petition No. 497 Wayne State University (WSU), request to outright vacate the south part of
the north-south alley, 17 feet wide, ?rst west of Cass Avenue; also to vacate and convert to

The petition was referred to the City Engineering Division DPW for investigation (utility review)

The request is being made so that Wayne State University can construct a new development known
as the ?Hilberry Gateway Performance Complex? involving building renovation of the existing
Hilberry Theatre; and construction of a 71,300 square foot addition.

The request was approved by the Solid Waste Division DPW, and Traf?c Engineering Division
DPW (TED), and City Engineering DPW (CED). The construction of the proposed turnaround
in the alley will be done under plans approved by both TED and CED. Provisions for the
turnaround to be constructed under plans approved by TED and permits from CED are a part Of
the resolution.

Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) has no objection to the conversion to easement
and outright vacation. The speci?c DWSD provisions for easements and vacations are included
in the resolution.

DTE Energy reports having services in the area. WSU has already made arrangements to relocate
the DTE facilities. Provisions to maintain access to DTE facilities in the easement area; and to
pay for the removal work for the vacation is a part of the resolution.

RE: 9115 Artesian Walkway Damage

 

Could you please investigate and respond as to why when the city contractors were tasked with
widening the street on Artesian at Cathedral, they did not return the walkway at 9115 Artesian
to its original state. The privately owned walkway originally extended from the sidewalk to the
curb. After the repair work, it now only extends half way between the sidewalk and curb.
Thank you in advance for an update and resolution.
