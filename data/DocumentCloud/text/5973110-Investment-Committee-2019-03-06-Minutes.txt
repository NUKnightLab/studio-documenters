GENERAL COUNSEL’S REPORT- continued
Re: Raven Asset-Based Opportunity Fund IV
Resolution Moved By: Trustee Hall-Wagner – Supported By: Trustee Sheehan
WHEREAS, the Board of Trustees of the General Retirement System of the City of
Detroit is vested with the authority and fiduciary responsibility for the administration,
management, and operation of the Retirement System, and
WHEREAS, the provisions of the plan are subject to the applicable provisions of the
Internal Revenue Code, applicable state law, the applicable charter and ordinance
provisions of the City of Detroit and the Combined Plan for the General Retirement
System, and
WHEREAS, the Investment Committee of the General Retirement System of the City of
Detroit (“Investment Committee”) was established in connection with the Eighth
Amended Plan for the Adjustment of Debts of the City of Detroit, and
WHEREAS, the Investment Committee serves in a fiduciary capacity and was
established for the purpose of making recommendations to and approving actions by
the Board of Trustees of the General Retirement System of the City of Detroit (the
“Board”), and
WHEREAS, Section 15.2 of the Combined Plan provides in pertinent part that all
actions and recommendations of the Investment Committee shall be forwarded to the
Board for consideration and are subject to Board approval. If the Board (a) fails to
approve or disapprove an Investment Management decision that has been
recommended by an affirmative vote of the Investment Committee, and such failure
continues for forty-five days after the date that the recommendation was made to the
Board, or (b) the Board disapproves an Investment Management decision within such
forty-five day period but fails to provide to the Investment Committee within such fortyfive day period a detailed written response outlining the reasons for such disapproval,
then the Investment Committee and the Chief Investment Officer are authorized to
implement the decision, and
WHEREAS, Section 15.2 further provides in pertinent part that if the Board disapproves
an Investment Committee recommendation within such forty-five day period and

MARCH 06, 2019

GENERAL COUNSEL’S REPORT- continued
Re: Raven Asset-Based Opportunity Fund IV-continued
WHEREAS, the Investment Committee previously approved an asset allocation for the
Retirement System’s portfolio to Credit Opportunities. The Investment Consultant,
NEPC, and the Chief Investment Officer made a recommendation in December, 2018 to
consider an investment in the Raven Asset Based Opportunities Fund IV, managed by
Raven Capital Management as part of the System’s Credit Opportunities allocation. The
Investment Committee members raised numerous questions and several concerns at
the December meeting. These issues were addressed with the Investment Committee
by NEPC with a written report at the Committee’s February 11, 2019 meeting. After
presentation by NEPC at the meeting, the Investment Committee resolved to approve
the recommendation of Staff and NEPC to commit $20 million to Raven Asset Based
Opportunity Fund IV (“Raven Fund IV”).
WHEREAS, this investment and the Investment Committee’s recommendation were
presented by the Chief Investment Officer to the Board of Trustees at its meeting held
February 20, 2019. During review and discussion, the following concerns were raised by
the Trustees:
a. The management fee on the Raven Fund IV is 1.5% on committed capital.
The firm history on earlier funds for vintage years 2012 to 2016 demonstrate
a measurable difference between Commitments and Invested Capital. The
1.5% management fee is on the high end of management fees and it is not
prudent to pay a management fee on a commitment that may never be called
by the manager and invested.
b. The net IRR of Raven Capital Management’s earlier funds do not reflect
returns consistent with the 13 – 15% IRR projected for Raven Fund IV. The
Trustees understand the J-Curve expected returns for these types of
investments, but they were of the opinion that some of the earlier vintage year
funds should have come to greater value.
c. The schedule of First Lien, Second Lien and Equity by calendar year (pg. 11
of the NEPC February 2019 Raven Fund IV Analysis booklet) and the
Secured Vs. Unsecured investments by calendar year (pg. 12) reflect an
increasing exposure to Second Lien investments and Equity, as well as,
Unsecured investments which appears to suggest that Raven is taking on
more and more risk within the Fund.
d. NEPC had indicated to the Investment Committee that if the Committee
decided not to move forward with Raven, NEPC had other diversifying
strategies that they could bring forward for consideration.

GENERAL COUNSEL’S REPORT- continued
Re: Raven Asset-Based Opportunity Fund IV-continued
e. There were no updated 2018 performance numbers on how the fund has
recently performed. The numbers presented were only through 2017. NEPC
appeared to have updated numbers at the Investment Committee meeting but
nothing was provided in writing to the Committee or the Board.
WHEREAS, the Board has discussed this matter amongst the Board members and with
the Chief Investment Officer, therefore be it
RESOLVED, that the Board acknowledges receipt and review of the Investment
Committee’s approval of the recommendation of Staff and NEPC to commit $20 million
to Raven Asset Based Opportunity Fund IV (“Raven Fund IV”), and
FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Board hereby disapproves of the Investment
Committee’s recommendation with respect to Raven Fund IV and directs that
notification be provided to the Investment Committee of the Board’s disapproval along
with a detailed written response outlining the reasons for such disapproval in
accordance with Section 15.2 of the Combined Plan Document,, and
FURTHER RESOLVED, that a copy of this resolution shall be provided to the GRS
