Report on CountyCare Health Plan (continued)
During the discussion of the information, a question arose regarding the CountyCare organizational chart.
Mr. Kiamos indicated that staff are currently working on it; once revisions are finalized, a copy will be
provided to the Committee.
Director Thomas inquired whether information can be provided that reflects the percentage of CountyCare
members who have chosen their primary care provider from within CCHHS. Additionally, Chairman Junge
inquired whether the administration can track data on members who fill their prescriptions at CCHHS versus
filling them at outside pharmacies. Mr. Kiamos responded that this information will be provided.
Director Thomas noted that the Medicaid Managed Long Term Services and Supports (MLTSS) and Waiver
population is growing; it would be good to get that information also. Mr. Kiamos stated that that type of
information would typically be included in the periodic report from Mary Sajdak, Senior Director of
Integrated Care; he will coordinate with Ms. Sajdak to relay that request.
Mr. Elwell provided information on two (2) other plans that will be reported on in the future. CCHHS is
now at risk for HMOI; 3,700 members came in on January 1st. Another plan that CCHHS has had for a while
but is getting a bit more organized each day is the CareLink plan, which has 27,000 members. For that plan,
CCHHS will probably be adding some partner organizations in the near future. Both of those plans will start
being reported to the Committee at the next meeting.
