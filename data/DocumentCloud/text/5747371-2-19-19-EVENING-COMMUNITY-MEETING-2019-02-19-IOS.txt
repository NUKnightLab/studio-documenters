HONORABLE INTERNAL OPERATION STANDING COMMITTEE:
Re: Appointment-Historic Designation Advisory Board Members

As the Council considers ?lling two seats on the Historic Designation Advisory Board, it seems
appropriate to remind Council Members that there is one statutory requirements for a member of
the board and also some needs relating to the City?s status as ?Certi?ed Local Government.?

It is a requirement of our ordinance that one member of the Historic Designation Advisory Board
be a representative of a local preservation organization which may be, but is not limited to, an
historic district association or resides in an historic district. The present board has several
members who meet this criterion.

Beginning in 2001 the City has been quali?ed as a ?Certi?ed Local Government? (CLG) under
the federal historic preservation program. This bene?t gives the city direct input into the
nomination of Detroit properties to the National Register of Historic Places. More importantly,
the status makes the city eligible for grant funds from the federal government.

Under the CLG program, we are required to have on the Advisory Board persons with certain
skills to review National Register programs. The skills required include, but are not limited to, an
understanding of historic preservation and the important role of culturally and architectural
signi?cant structures in Detroit. I?ve attached the following resumes of Carolyn Carter and
Joseph Rashid for your consideration.

As always, I am available if there are questions.

Carolyn Carter

Carolyn is a historian and researcher in history and public history. She has been researching the
Michigan Central Railroad?s (MCRR) connection to the UGRR story for over ?ve years. The
Michigan Central Railroad (MCRR) Third Street Station was involved in the escapes of freedom
seekers traveling to the Detroit, MI by railroad using the Third Street Station as a route to
Canada. Freedom seekers used these trains to escape to freedom. The residents who lived on
Fort and Third Streets (Cir. 1846-1890), the founders and employees of the MCRR, prominent
businessmen, clergy and the Detroit community supported UGRR efforts. Its founders and
employees were very involved in Underground Railroad activities, such as John Murray Forbes,
President of the MCR Company and James F. Joy attorney and later MCRR President and
Founder/President of the Fort Street Union Depot were dynamically involved.
