GENERAL BACKGROUND

On January 6, 2000, the Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) Board of Commissioners approved
the Plan for Transformation, which called for sweeping changes in both the administration and
operation of CHA. The Plan for Transformation was approved by the US. Department of
Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and incorporated into a Moving to Work (MTW)
Demonstration Agreement, which was executed on February 6, 2000. The Agreement was
subsequently amended in February 2001, requiring CHA to submit an annual plan to HUD,
describing anticipated activities that will utilize MTW ?exibility.

On June 26, 2008, CHA executed an Amended and Restated MTW Agreement (Restated
Agreement) between itself and HUD, which supersedes the original MTW Agreement. The
Restated Agreement extends participation in the MTW Demonstration to the end of
FY2018. continued participation in the MTW Program is contingent upon adherence to
the requirements set out in the Restated Agreement, which includes submission of an Annual
Plan. The document represents CHA's FY2013 MTW Annual Plan and details 
anticipated activities for FY2013.

Per HUD guidelines, CHA has organized the discussions of activities in the FY2013 MTW
Annual Plan under the following Sections: Introduction, General Housing Authority Operating
lnfonnation, Related Housing Authority Information, Long-Term MTW Plan.
Proposed MTW Activities HUD Approval Requested, Ongoing MTW Activities - HUD
Approval Previously Granted, Sources and Uses of Funds, and Administrative.

Each activity CHA seeks to engage in that either uses MTW funds or requires a MTW regulatory
waiver, has to meet at least one of the following three MTW Statutory Objectives:

work by participating in job training, educational programs, or programs
that assist people to obtain employment and become economically self-
suf?cient.

I MT Statutory Objective Reduce costs and achieve greater cost
effectiveness in federal expenditures.

Prior to submission of the FY2013 MTW Annual Plan to the Board, a 30-day public comment
period was conducted wherein both residents and the public alike were able to submit comments
orally and in writing, regarding the information contained in the proposed Plan. The public
comment period ran from August 31 through October 1, 2012. During such time, on September
11, 2012, a public comment hearing was held. Prior to ?nalizing the FY2013 MTW Annual
Plan, CHA gave consideration to comments received during the public comment period.

To this end, CHA has complied with the requirements of the Restated Agreement and HUD
regulations regarding annual plans. CHA requests that the Board of Commissioners approve the
FY2013 MTW Annual Plan, and the form, CHA Certi?cations of Compliance with MTW Plan
Requirements and Related Regulations. Pending Board approval, CHA will submit the FY2013
MTW Annual Plan to HUD.
