CY19 Q2

SIR (Standardized Infection Ratio) is a summary
measure which compares the actual number of
Healthcare Associated Infections (HAI) in a facility
with the baseline data for standard population. SIR >
1.0 indicates more HAIs were observed than predicted,
conversely SIR of < 1.0 indicates that fewer HAIs were
observed than predicted.

Quality and Patient Safety Committee Meeting

Leathecia Arnold, MHA, RHIA, CCS, CHTS-TR
Tara Ruhlen, MPH
20 September 2019
16 of 51

 Background
Inaccurate documentation of patient complexity skews metrics related to length
of stay (LOS), risk of mortality (ROM) and patient disease burden
Documentation practices at Cook County Health always reflected our high quality
care, but opportunities existed to more accurately reflect our patient complexity
Accurate portrayals of patient complexity improves clinical outcome metrics,
quality of care, reimbursement, and aligns with the IMPACT 2020 Strategic Plan

2

17 of 51

 Background: Documentation and IMPACT 2020
Objective 1.1: Standardize clinical operations, practices and procedures across
the System to improve quality, reliability, and efficiency

Objective 3.4: Improve provider documentation to support coding and billing to
reflect the level of service provided and the complexity of illness of the patients

3

18 of 51

 Background: How Documentation Works
• Diagnosis Related Groups (DRGs) created by CMS to simplify the ICD-10 into 740+
groups
• Most conditions can be classified into 3 different DRGs (triplet)
• DRGs change with patient comorbidities which are labeled "complications and comorbidities" (CC) and "major complications and co-morbidities" (MCC)
Example:
Pneumonia in a healthy patient: DRG 195
Pneumonia in a patient with acidosis (CC): DRG 194
Pneumonia in a patient with sepsis (MCC): DRG 193
4

19 of 51

 Background: Capture Rate
The capture rate is the percentage of discharged patients that have a CC or MCC
as compared with the base DRG
Example:
100 patients are discharged with pneumonia (base DRG 195)
60 had a CC or MCC "captured" in the documentation
60 pts with CC or MCC
Capture rate =
= 60%
100 pts total with pneumonia

5

20 of 51

 Background: Case Mix Index
• Each DRG is assigned a relative weight by CMS
• Imparts complexity, resource use, length of stay and reimbursement
• The case mix index (CMI) is the average relative weight for all discharged patients

Example
Normal newborn (DRG 795) : 0.18
Pneumonia w/o CC or MCC (DRG 195) : 0.68
Pneumonia w/ MCC (DRG 193) : 1.31
Heart transplant with MCC (DRG 001) : 26.41
6

21 of 51

 Aim Statement
• We seek to improve our institutional CMI with a system-wide educational effort
focused on divisional didactics and training supported by software-driven
identification of improvement opportunities in real time.
• Surgical CMI target May 2020: 3.1 (baseline 2.4)

• Medical CMI target May 2020: 1.3 (baseline 0.98)
• System-wide capture rate May 2020: 75% (baseline 45%)

Plan
1. Recruit physician leaders from each division with admitting privileges to act as
“documentation champions”
2. Assist “documentation champions” in crafting and distributing documentation
educational sessions to attendings and house staff (train the trainer)
3. Utilize the clinical documentation team in conjunction with software to
identify documentation shortfalls and suggest real-time alternatives

 Study Summary

Lessons Learned
• Major progress made with medical DRGs, with further work now focused on
identifying more nuanced lapses in documentation rather than “low hanging
fruit”
• Surgical DRG improvement relies on continued educational efforts (surgical
house staff mostly rotators and thus more logistically challenging) and
collaboration with medical consultants to capture medical complexity

• Real time examples necessary to train those not well-versed in this relatively
new domain
