BACKGROUND

 

Maria Pappas
Cook County Treasurer
October 24, 2013
Toni Preckwinkle
President
Cook County Board of Commissioners
118 N. Clark Street, Room 500
Chicago, IL 60602
Dear President Preckwinkle:

It is with pleasure that I submit to you the Fiscal Year 2014 Budget for my Office.
I believe this budget shows that my office continues to demonstrate fiscal discipline by creating a leaner and more efficient operation without
overburdening taxpayers. This will be the 13th straight year that we cut the taxpayer-funded portion of our budget, which we achieve by position
reductions made possible through automation efforts.
I also want to take this opportunity to thank you and the other real estate tax offices for collaborating to develop projects that improve Cook
County’s property tax system. Our mutual efforts will help build a streamlined and even more efficient property tax system in the future.
Here are some highlights of the FY2014 budget for the Treasurer’s Office:
•

Our 060 corporate budget falls from $3,906,208 to $1,952,814, a 50 percent decrease in money from tax revenues.

•

Our headcount falls to ninety-two (92), and is now 13.2 fewer FTE’s than in FY2013 – and 63.2 percent less than the 250 employees the Office
had in 1998.

•

In 1998 the Office’s $10.6 million budget was all “corporate,” money from taxpayers. Today, more than two-thirds of our total budget comes
from commercial users of our services.

•

The 534 Account uses fees collected from commercial users to upgrade our technology, enhance internal systems and further streamline the
Office.

•

Since its inception, the 534 Account has helped the County save $151 million in tax money.

2

 Because of our ongoing technological improvements, we continue to make corporate and personnel cuts without compromising service. In
fact, we will improve our service – and continue to coordinate with the other real estate offices on improving the entire property tax system.
The major office project for FY2014 is the Comprehensive Scanning and Document Imaging Initiative. We intend to eliminate physical paper
coming to the Office and from within the Office by installing systems for scanning, imaging and electronic work flow. The goal is to have all
documents stored on hard drives instead of thousands of boxes sitting on the shelves at the Rockwell Warehouse.
Other projects we already are working on or are prepared to begin include:
•
•
•
•

Electronic Warrant Book
Central Repository for Property Tax Identification (PIN) Data
DDO Web-site Enhancements
Automation of Bank Reconciliations

I am proud to submit the FY2014 budget for the Treasurer’s Office. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.
Sincerely,

Maria Pappas
Cook County Treasurer

 BACKGROUND
Prior to reviewing the budget of the Treasurer’s Office, it is important to understand how it
operates with two separate and distinct budgetary accounts:

 060 – County Treasurer Corporate Account
• Funded primarily by taxpayer sources
• FY2014 Budget: $1,952,814

 534 – County Treasurer Tax Sale Automation Account
• Funded by fees/revenues approved by the County Board
• Established by County ordinance on April 6, 1999
• FY2014 Budget: $9,605,533
In recent years, the Treasurer’s Office has continually reduced the 060 Corporate Account by
shifting to the 534 Automation Account. Many governmental entities simply raise property taxes
instead of creating alternative funding sources and reducing their budgets.
NOTE: The Treasurer’s Office pays the health care, vision, dental, life insurance and pension
benefits for employees on the 534 account. The result is a savings of $9.4 million to the County
from FY2008 to FY2014.

2) Reduce Headcount
Headcount has gone from 250 positions in FY1998 to 92 in FY2014, a reduction of 63.2 percent.
• Reductions in staff have occurred through elimination of vacant positions, through
attrition and automation of services.
• Recruited and hired specialized professional employees in Information Technology,
Finance and Legal departments.
• Conducted office-wide training to focus on the most important topics, processes and
procedures. Continued to cross-train in all departments.

 FY2014 BUDGET HIGHLIGHT 4: FURTHER SELF-FUNDING
4) Become Further Self-Funded
• The office continues moving toward being self-funded by relying less on taxpayer
funding on the 060 corporate account and more on user-based revenues, approved by
the Board, to fund the 534 automation account.
• The following revenues allow us to further enhance the automation of our operations,
thus saving money and streamlining processes for both commercial users and individual
taxpayers:

5) Projects
• In FY2014, the Treasurer’s Office will continue its countywide commitment for additional
projects aimed at improving the entire property tax system.
• The major office project for FY2014 is the Comprehensive Scanning and Document
Imaging Initiative. The intent is to eliminate physical paper coming to the office and from
within the office by installing systems for scanning, imaging and electronic work flow. The
goal is to have all documents stored on hard drives instead of thousands of boxes sitting
on the shelves at the Rockwell Warehouse.

• The creation of the Electronic Warrant Book is another project for FY2014. We are already
working with the Clerk’s Office on this project designed to replace the physical Warrant
Books located on the 4th Floor and 3M with an electronic system. All PIN-related
transactions will be posted on a daily basis automatically, thereby eliminating the need for
manual postings.
Other projects include:
• Central Repository for Property Tax Identification (PIN) Data
• DDO Web Site Enhancements
• Automation of Bank Reconciliations
• Property Tax Portal (Phase 3)

 Automation/Information Technology – Major Projects
The Treasurer’s Office will continue its countywide commitment to automation in FY2014. Last
year, CCTO provided $1.4 million to the Bureau of Technology to fund projects aimed at
improving the entire property tax system, including:

 Budget – Fiscal Responsibility
Submitted annual budgets for the 060 County Treasurer budget below the previous year, for 13
consecutive budgets beginning in FY2002 with a 1.1% reduction, followed by reductions of 1.9%,
3.5%, 3.2%, 6.8%, 8.3%, 34.8%, 6.8%, 7.2%, 5.2%, 6.5% and 19.4%. The FY2014 proposed
corporate budget features a 50% reduction. Beginning in FY2008, reductions are due primarily to
shifting the burden from the Corporate, taxpayer-funded 060 Corporate Account to the 534
County Treasurer – Automation Account, which is funded through fees collected by the
Treasurer’s Office.

 Reduction in Staff
Reduced staff by 158 positions, a decrease of 63.2%. (FY1998 – 250 positions to FY2014 – 92
positions.) This reduction occurred through automation, attrition, reduction in staff and closing
five satellite offices. Note: Upon taking office, recruited and hired specialized professional-level
employees.

AUTOMATION
HIGHLIGHTS

AUTOMATION HIGHLIGHTS – PIN RESEARCH (INTERNAL PORTAL)
The PIN Research System is the centerpiece of the Cook County Treasurer’s Office.
The internal system centralizes various forms of crucial data that otherwise are
accessible only via cumbersome stand-alone modules. It underwent a major overhaul
in 2013 and the result is that even more data is available electronically to internal
users.
By entering a PIN, an employee has access to 20 years of PIN data within one single
system. PIN Research eliminates the need for an employee to access up to 14 different
programs. The data with the system includes:
• Entire PIN Summary, including mailing address, property address, exemption
data, payment overview and photo of the parcel.
• Detailed payment data, which includes the amount paid, date paid, and
method of payment.
• All scanned images, including payment coupons and checks, post penalty
envelope images (used to verify late-payment according to USPS postmark),
Name/Address change applications, and Returned Certified Mail images.
• Refund history.
• STOPS notification (to prevent duplicate payment on a previously paid PIN).
• History of correspondence, sent from taxpayer and sent to taxpayer.

 AUTOMATION HIGHLIGHTS – DEBT DISCLOSURE ORDINANCE
The Taxing District Debt Disclosure Ordinance approved by the County Board of
Commissioners on September 1, 2009 provides extraordinary transparency in
government.
The ordinance requires taxing districts to submit audited financial statements from
their most recent audit that includes total debts and liabilities, total of gross tax levy,
gross operating budget revenue and pension information such as the funded and
unfunded amounts.
This ordinance and its amendments:
• Created a single electronic repository which allows taxpayers to electronically
access the financial information they need to make informed decisions about
the taxing districts they support.
• Mandated the Treasurer's Office to house and maintain the electronic
infrastructure where each taxing district uploads its information and makes that
information electronically available to taxpayers.
In 2012, the Treasurer’s Office created a virtual online tax bill that allows taxpayers to
view the financial information to their associated tax districts based on a PIN.

AUTOMATION HIGHLIGHTS – PROPERTY TAX PORTAL
The Treasurer’s Office managed a project creating the Property Tax Portal for property
owners in the County.

The portal is a collaborative effort that allows residents access to information such as:
•
•
•
•
•

Ownership and liens – Provided by the Recorder of Deeds
Tax payments and refunds – Provided by the Treasurer
Valuations, exemptions and appeals – Provided by the Assessor
Prior year tax bill statuses, delinquencies and TIF information – Provided by the Clerk
Appeals – Provided by the Board of Review

The Treasurer’s Office went live with the new web site on April 1, 2012, and
completed the project in just 90 days. A second phase of the portal went live on
September 5, 2013.
The portal has been visited 2.3 million times, or roughly 4,500 visits each day.

AUTOMATION HIGHLIGHTS – STOPS
STAT FACT:
STOPS was implemented for the 2009 Second Installment property tax collection in an
effort to reduce the number of erroneous duplicate and overpayments of property
taxes, and thus eliminate the need for taxpayers to apply for a refund.
Since November 2010, over 40,000 duplicate payment attempts have been stopped in
the amount of nearly $165 million.

55

 AUTOMATION HIGHLIGHTS – STOPS
The STOPS program is designed to ensure that only the legally responsible party
submits payment.
STOPS prevents duplicate and overpayments by flagging screens within each of the
four main payment channels:
•
•
•
•

Third Party Agent (TPA) - Mortgage/Title Company electronic bulk payment site
Mail (Lockbox)
Online (e-check and credit card)
In Person

A payment will be stopped if the taxes have already been paid or a TPA, such as a
mortgage company, commits to pay the taxes.
If a payment is stopped, the payer is notified in a letter mailed by the Treasurer’s
Office. The payer is given the opportunity to only resubmit payment if legally
responsible to do so. When this occurs, the first payee is authorized to receive a
refund.
56

 AUTOMATION HIGHLIGHTS – STOPS
Mail payments are compared against a daily STOPS file during processing at Lockbox.
Payments identified as STOPS are compared to the internal PIN Research System to
verify prior payment or commitment.

57

 AUTOMATION HIGHLIGHTS – STOPS
Taxpayers attempting to make an in-person property tax payment at the Treasurer’s
Office or Chase Bank location are alerted if the taxes were paid or are committed to be
paid. The below screen shot displays the message that appears within the Treasurer’s
collection system.

58

 AUTOMATION HIGHLIGHTS – STOPS
Taxpayers attempting to make an online property tax payment at
www.cookcountytreasurer.com are alerted if the taxes were paid or are committed to
be paid by a mortgage company.

59

 AUTOMATION HIGHLIGHTS – STOPS
Taxpayers who hold mortgages with certain Third-Party Agents (TPA) received
notification on their tax bill of a TPA’s pre-commitment to pay property taxes. The
message appears within the ‘Important Payment Messages’ box on the coupon
portion in an effort to prevent duplicate payments being made to the PIN.

60

 AUTOMATION HIGHLIGHTS – AUTOMATED NAME CHANGE SYSTEM
The Treasurer’s Office created an Automated Name Change System that automatically
updates a taxpayer’s name and address when a Transfer Declaration is filed with the
Cook County Recorder of Deeds. The Treasurer’s Office receives and uploads name
and address data that is entered by the Recorder’s Office staff. This cooperation
between governmental agencies improves efficiencies for taxpayers by eliminating the
need for redundant forms and duplicate data entry.

61

 AUTOMATION HIGHLIGHTS – AUTOMATED NAME CHANGE SYSTEM

STAT FACT:
The Treasurer’s Office has electronically received over 595,000 name changes since
July 2005 as a result of the collaboration with the Recorder of Deeds.

AUTOMATION HIGHLIGHTS – AUTOMATED TAX SALE
The Treasurer’s Office automated the traditional outcry Annual Tax Sale auction to an
online auction in the summer of 2008. Process of tax buyer registration, collateral
deposits, bidding and payments went from a manually intensive system to an online
Internet system.
• Sale previously lasted 20 days; now it takes only four days. Historically a daily
auction would require a staff of eight people. The decrease in the duration of
days of the sale allows staff to work on other Treasurer’s Office projects.
• A computer program selects the winning bidder instead of a human
auctioneer, thereby eliminating any human judgment and ensures that the
awarding of parcels is completely random.
• Registration, collateral deposits and payments are completed online which all
contribute to creating a “virtual office” that has less reliance on customer
service and cashiering personnel.
