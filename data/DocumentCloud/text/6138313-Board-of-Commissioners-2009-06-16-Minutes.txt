THE HONORABLE SANDRA OTAKA
WHEREAS, Almighty God in His infinite wisdom has called a distinguished judge and a passionate
activist, The Honorable Sandra Otaka, from our midst; and
WHEREAS, a third-generation Japanese-American, Judge Otaka’s mother and grandparents were held in
U.S. Internment camps during World War II; and
WHEREAS, her search for and demand for justice began in her youth, when Judge Otaka campaigned
against the Vietnam War; and
WHEREAS, Judge Otaka matriculated at the University of California at Berkley at age 28; while at
Berkeley, she volunteered as a legal clerk with an Asian-American law firm where she worked to
overturn the conviction of a Japanese-American shipyard worker who was jailed in 1944 for failing to
report to an internment camp; and

1855

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 16, 2009
WHEREAS, Judge Otaka went on to earn a J.D. from the University of California at Los Angeles, and
during this time her dedication to activism continued; she was arrested while campaigning against cuts to
an affirmative-action program that impacted Asian-Americans; and
WHEREAS, in 1989, eleven years before she became a judge, Ms. Otaka staunchly defended the
Japanese-American community by spearheading a campaign to have a Cook County judge removed who
had launched a rant against the Japanese from the bench; one year later, this judge was voted out of
office; and
WHEREAS, two years later, Judge Otaka helped Lynne Kawamoto get appointed as the County’s first
Asian-American associate judge; and

Phelan to serve as a Commissioner on the newly established Human Rights Commission; and

and expertise as a member of the committee responsible for drafting the ground-breaking Cook County
Human Rights Ordinance. In 1993, the Cook County Board of Commissioners adopted legislation
enacting the County’s Human Rights Ordinance, which is one of the most comprehensive and progressive
local civil rights laws in the Country. Judge Otaka was elected as Vice Chair of the Commission and
served with passion and distinction until she was appointed to the bench in 2000; and
WHEREAS, before being elected to the bench, Judge Otaka was a commercial litigator with the law firm
of Sidley Austin and worked for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and she continued to be a
potent voice and advocate on behalf of the Asian-American community; and
WHEREAS, Judge Otaka was appointed by the Illinois Supreme Court to the bench in 2000; she became
only the second Asian-American to be elected a judge by Illinois voters; she was retained as a Child
Protection Division judge, where she heard abuse and neglect cases with compassion and a keen sense of
her responsibilities; and
WHEREAS, Judge Otaka lovingly raised her late brother’s son, Jeffrey, as her own; and
WHEREAS, The Honorable Sandra Otaka will be remembered in the hearts of those people whom she
touched and loved.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that I, Todd H. Stroger, President of the Cook County
Board of Commissioners, on behalf of the more than five million residents of Cook County, do hereby
express my deepest condolences and most heartfelt sympathy to the family as well as to the many friends
and loved ones of The Honorable Sandra Otaka, and may a suitable copy of this Resolution be tendered to
the family of The Honorable Sandra Otaka so that her rich legacy may be so honored and ever cherished.

PROPOSED ORDINANCE
COOK COUNTY HEALTHCARE ACCESS PROTECTION INITIATIVE
(HAPI) ORDINANCE
BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that Chapter 38 Health and Human
Services, Article V, Section 38-94 of the Cook County Code is hereby enacted as follows:
ARTICLE V: COOK COUNTY HEALTH & HOSPITALS SYSTEM
Sec. 38-94.
(a)

Healthcare Access Protection Initiative (HAPI)
Short Title. This Ordinance may be cited as the Healthcare Access Protection Initiative

(HAPI).
(b)
Purpose. The purpose of this Ordinance is to improve access to basic, affordable health
care services for all Cook County residents – especially poor and low-income uninsured residents –
through regulation of local general hospitals, which play an important role in the local health care safetynet. Access to necessary, quality health services is vital to the health, safety and welfare of all individuals
living in Cook County, and should not be based upon one’s ability to pay.
(c)
Authority. This Ordinance is within the County’s home rule regulatory powers granted
by Article VII, Section 6(a) of the Illinois Constitution.
(d)

Findings. The Cook County Board of Commissioners finds that:

1861

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 16, 2009
(1)

Rising health care costs have pushed private health insurance beyond financial reach for
many poor and low-income working families, thereby increasing the number of the
uninsured. Since 1999, average health insurance premiums for family coverage have
increased 119%, according to the 2008 Kaiser Family Foundation’s Employer Health
Benefits Survey.

(2)

According to 2007 U.S. Census Bureau data, 1.2 million individuals living in the City of
Chicago and the surrounding Metropolitan Area are uninsured. While the majority of the
uninsured are working, many do not earn enough to afford private health coverage. Fully
41% of the uninsured living in Chicago and the Metropolitan Area earn just $25,000 a
year or less.

(3)

Minorities in particular have been disproportionately affected by rising health care costs.
The overwhelming majority of the uninsured in Chicago and the Metropolitan Area are
minorities: 37.3% are Latino, 29.7% are African-American and 25.3% are White.

(4)

When the uninsured are struck by serious illness or injury, financial devastation is
common as medical bills mount. The Kaiser Family Foundation reports that nearly half –
46% – of low-income families (those making $30,000 or less a year) experience problems
paying medical bills. In 2007, overwhelming medical bills forced an estimated 20,349
Illinois residents to file for bankruptcy. Fully 61% of these medical bankruptcies were
Chicago families.

(5)

Hospital behavior toward the uninsured plays a direct role in access to health care and
health outcomes. Many studies have found that exorbitant hospital charges combined
with aggressive billing and collection practices discourages low-income, uninsured
individuals from seeking medical care when it is needed. Accordingly, the uninsured
often wait until they are sicker to get care, which results in more expensive care.

(6)

As a result, the uninsured have worse health outcomes than those with coverage.
According to the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured, uninsured heartattack and trauma patients are less likely to receive surgical interventions; uninsured
heart-attack patients have higher mortality; uninsured cancer patients are more likely to
be diagnosed at late-stage and have shorter survival; uninsured patients with appendicitis
are more likely to have a ruptured appendix; uninsured babies have a poorer survival rate
than privately insured babies; and uninsured trauma patients are more likely to die.

(7)

The local health care safety-net includes many different types of health care delivery
organizations that deliver health care services to County residents with barriers to
accessing health care. Such barriers include, but are not limited to, lack of insurance; no
or low income; and ethnic and cultural characteristics.

(8)

This Ordinance focuses on the role of local general hospitals in providing affordable,
necessary medical care to poor and low-income uninsured County residents because
hospitals are typically where people go when they experience a traumatic injury or
illness.

(9)

Lawmakers intended that both public and private hospitals play an important role in
delivering necessary health care services to poor and low-income uninsured individuals.

1862

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 16, 2009
(10)

Cook County’s Health & Hospitals System is the largest provider of indigent care in the
County and the State. Currently, the System spends more than half – 55.5% – of its total
expenditures in delivering care to the uninsured who do not have the ability to pay for
their medical services. As such, the County does not receive payment for the
overwhelming majority of this care. Rather, it is subsidized by County taxpayers.

(11)

According to an April 10, 2009 Chicago Tribune investigation, “[i]ndigent and underinsured patients are turning to Cook County’s Stroger Hospital after not getting fully
treated at non-profit hospitals, swamping the cash-strapped public facility, while fueling
the county’s sky-high sales tax…[t]axpayers provide nearly half of the county hospital’s
revenues along with hundreds of millions of dollars in property and sales tax breaks to
non-profits.”

(12)

The same Chicago Tribune investigation found that some patients arriving at Stroger’s
emergency room come “bearing discharge slips, prescriptions, even Yahoo and Google
maps from non-profit hospitals,” and these hospitals are, according to Dr. Jesse Pines, an
assistant professor of emergency medicine at the University of Pennsylvania School of
Medicine and a member of the American College of Emergency Room Physicians,
engaging in “legalized patient dumping.”

(13)

While public hospitals are intended to play a far greater role than private hospitals in
caring for the uninsured, private hospitals are expected to play a vital role. However,
numerous reports have concluded that many private hospitals do not do a good job of
providing hospital care that is affordable to poor and low-income uninsured individuals,
thereby effectively acting as a barrier to medical treatment when it is needed.

(14)

When local hospitals do not provide affordable care to poor and low-income uninsured
County residents, this impacts the County health care system, both in terms of patient
load and financial burden. In addition, such hospital behavior negatively affects access to
care for individuals in need of medical care but who do not have the ability to pay full
hospital charges.

(15)

Access to affordable quality health care – hospital care in particular – is in the local
public interest to ensure that all County residents, rather than just those with the ability to
pay, get the appropriate medical care when it is necessary. This Ordinance seeks to
provide a regulatory framework to protect access to care for the most vulnerable County
residents by encouraging local hospitals to provide affordable health care services to this
population, and discouraging hospital behavior that acts as an effective barrier to access
to care. In addition, this Ordinance will assist the County with its cost of caring for lowincome, uninsured County residents that private general hospitals either cannot or will
not provide care for.

(e)

Healthcare Access Protection Initiative (HAPI) Fee.

1868

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 16, 2009
(1)

Healthcare Access Protection Initiative (HAPI) Fee. To ensure that low-income,
uninsured individuals living in the County have access to basic, affordable health care,
and to assist the County with its cost of caring for uninsured patients other hospitals
either cannot or will not care for, each general hospital operating in the County that is not
a safety-net hospital as defined in subsection (e) of this Ordinance shall annually provide
financial assistance as defined in subsection (f)(1), measured at cost, in an amount at least
equal to 4.5% of the hospital’s total hospital expenses. A safety-net hospital as defined in
subsection (e) shall annually provide financial assistance as defined in subsection (f)(1),
measured at cost, in an amount at least equal to 2.3% of the hospital’s total hospital
expenses. If a hospital that is not a safety-net hospital does not provide financial
assistance to eligible individuals in the required amount, the County shall impose a HAPI
Fee on each general hospital operating within the County equal to the difference between
the cost of financial assistance provided for the year, and 4.5% of total hospital expenses.
If a safety-net hospital does not provided financial assistance to eligible individuals in the
required amount, the County shall impose a HAPI Fee on each safety-net hospital
operating within the County equal to the difference between the cost of financial
assistance provided for the year, and 2.3% of total hospital expenses. A hospital may
elect to pay the full amount of the HAPI Fee in lieu of providing financial assistance to
eligible individuals pursuant to subsection (f). The fee shall be calculated annually on a
stand-alone hospital basis as follows:
a.

Determination of a general hospital’s total expenses for purposes of the
healthcare access protection fee. For purposes of calculating the fee, the amount
of a general hospital’s total expenses shall be determined by the hospital’s most
recent audited financial statements. If a hospital is part of an affiliated or
consolidated group that files audited financial statements on a group basis rather
than individually, total expenses for the stand-alone hospital shall be determined
from the consolidating statements in the affiliated or consolidated audited
financial statements.

b.

Amount of the HAPI Fee due. If the financial assistance provided by a general
hospital for the year in accordance with section (f)(1) of this Ordinance is less
than 4.5% of the hospital’s total expenses, a fee shall be paid to the County in an
amount equal to the difference between the cost of the financial assistance
provided, and 4.5% of the hospital’s total expenses. If the hospital is a safety-net
hospital as defined in subsection (e) of this Ordinance, and if the financial
assistance provided by a general hospital for the year in accordance with section
(f)(1) of this Ordinance is less than 2.3% of the hospital’s total expenses, a fee
shall be paid to the County in an amount equal to the difference between the cost
of the financial assistance provided, and 2.3% of the hospital’s total expenses.
Any fee due under this Ordinance shall be paid to the County Treasurer within 90
days of receipt of notice of any fee due.

1869

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 16, 2009
(h)
Date of Determination of any HAPI Fee. The HAPI Fee for a general hospital shall be
calculated by the County Clerk no later than October 1st of each year, using the most recent audited
financial statements of each hospital and the most recently filed hospital financial assistance statement,
both of which are required to be filed with the County Clerk pursuant to section (j) of this Ordinance.
The HAPI Fee shall be calculated annually for each general hospital located within the County. If a
hospital elects to pay the full amount of the fee in lieu of providing assistance pursuant to subsection (f),
the hospital shall notify the Clerk no later than October 1st of each year. If the hospital has provided such
notice to the Clerk, the hospital shall not be subject to the requirements of subsection (f) and shall not be
subject to the penalties set forth in subsection (k)(3) for failure to provide notice and information
otherwise required.
(i)
HAPI Fund. There is hereby created the HAPI Fund as a special fund in the County
Treasury. All HAPI fees and penalties paid under this Ordinance shall be deposited into the HAPI Fund.
Subject to appropriation, monies in the HAPI Fund shall be expended exclusively for uncompensated
indigent care at the Cook County Health & Hospitals System. No HAPI Fees or penalties paid pursuant
to this Ordinance may be transferred to the General Fund.
(j)
Financial Assistance Reporting. Not later than March 31st of each calendar year, each
general hospital operating in the County must submit the following to the County Clerk:
(1)

Financial assistance statement. A statement which identifies the aggregate dollar amount
of financial assistance furnished by the hospital in its most recently completed fiscal year
for which the data is available, in accordance with this Ordinance, to be reported at the
actual cost of the services provided based on the total cost-to-charge ratio derived from
the hospital’s most recently settled Medicare Cost Report. If a hospital is required to file
Form AG-CBP-1, Annual Non Profit Hospital Community Benefits Plan Report with the
Illinois Attorney General, a copy of this form is sufficient as long as the financial
assistance reported was provided in accordance with section (f)(1) of this Ordinance.

(2)

Most recent annual audited financial statements. The hospital’s most recent annual
audited financial statements, including consolidating statements if the hospital is part of
group or network that files consolidated or affiliated financial statements.

(3)

Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital Statement. A statement identifying whether
the hospital received Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital Payments in the most
recent year such payments were made by the State.

(4)

Other necessary information. Hospitals must report any other information the County
Clerk deems necessary to ensure compliance with the provisions of this Ordinance.

(k)

Implementation and Enforcement.

(1)

Determination of the HAPI Fee. The County Clerk shall be responsible for calculating

(2)

Financial assistance compliance review by the HAPI Officer. The County shall create a
position for a HAPI Officer. Such Officer shall be responsible for ensuring that each
general hospital in the County is in compliance with section (f) of this Ordinance. If the
Officer determines a general hospital is not in compliance with any of such provisions,
the Officer shall notify the hospital of the assessment of the appropriate penalty or
penalties provided for in section (k)(3) of this Ordinance. The HAPI Officer has the
authority to issue any rules necessary to carry out this Ordinance.

(3)

required under this Ordinance is subject to a civil penalty of $1,000 per day for
each day the required notice is not posted or notification is not provided.

b.

A general hospital that fails to provide information to the public as required
under this Ordinance is subject to a civil penalty of $1,000 per violation.

c.

A general hospital that violates any provision of this Ordinance other than the
provisions of sections (f)(1), and (g) is subject to a civil penalty of $1,000 per
violation.

d.

All fees and penalties provided for in this Ordinance shall constitute a debt to the
County. The State’s Attorney is authorized to institute a civil suit in the name of
the County to recover the amount of any such unpaid fee or penalty.

(l)
Effective date. This Ordinance shall take effect on the first day of the fiscal year of Cook
County following enactment.

follows:
Sec. 74-70.

Class 8a and 8b Designation/Assessment Class

(a) Class 8a. Real estate that is used primarily for industrial or commercial
purposes, which real estate would qualify for a class 8 designation pursuant to Sec. 74-62 thru
Sec. 74-64, except for the fact that the qualifying use of the property prior to application for
the incentive does not comply with the definition of abandoned property provided for in
Sec.74-62(b), can receive a designation as a class 8a property so long as the applicant can
show that it has complied with all of the requirements necessary to receive a class 8
designation per Sec. 74-62 thru Sec. 74-64, except for meeting the definition of abandonment
provided for in Sec. 74-62(b), but only when the Cook County Board of Commissioners
provides a resolution or ordinance in support of such designation absent abandonment.
1936

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 16, 2009
(1)

(2)

The Cook County Board of Commissioners may only provide such a
resolution or ordinance in support of class 8a designation absent
abandonment when:
a.

an applicant who collects or transmits sales tax has obtained from the
municipality in which the real estate is located or the Cook County
Board of Commissioners, if the real estate is located in an
unincorporated area, an agreement to abate a portion of the local
government’s sales tax generated by the industrial or commercial
enterprise located on such real estate and such abatement of sales tax
must cover the period of time for which the applicant would qualify
for this Class 8a incentive;

b.

applicant can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Cook County
Board of Commissioners that due to national and regional economic
conditions beyond its control the industrial or commercial enterprise
has undergone a significant reduction in net operating income of at
least 40% in the year it makes application for this incentive as
compared to the average net operating income of the industrial or
commercial enterprise in the prior three years;

c.

applicant provides objective and credible evidence including, but not
limited to, an economic impact study that demonstrates to the
satisfaction of the Cook County Board of Commissioners that the
ongoing industrial or commercial enterprise is not economically
viable and as such it will cease operations within sixty-days of the
submission of an eligibility application for class 8a designation to the
Cook County Assessor, and thereafter the property will become
vacant and unused for an extended period of time of at least twentyfour months; and

d.

applicant provides objective and credible evidence including, but not
limited to, an economic impact study that demonstrates to the
satisfaction of the Cook County Board of Commissioners that
designation as a class 8a property will allow the industrial or
commercial enterprise to be economically viable and thereby
continue its operations so that the industrial or commercial enterprise
can continue to occupy and fully utilize the real estate for an
extended period of time.

Such a resolution or ordinance must contain:
a.

a finding that the Cook County Board of Commissioners has
determined that industrial or commercial enterprise has undergone a
significant reduction in net operating income of at least 40% in the
year it makes application for the incentive as compared to the
average net operating income of the industrial or commercial
enterprise in the prior three years;

b.

a finding that the Cook County Board of Commissioners has
determined that class 8a designation of the property is necessary for
the ongoing industrial or commercial enterprise to continue its
operations and that without such designation the industrial or
commercial enterprise would not be economically viable causing the
property to become vacant and unused;
1937

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 16, 2009

(3)

(4)

c.

a statement by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that it

supports and consents to the application made to the Cook County
Assessor requesting designation as a class 8a property absent an
abandonment requirement.

When the real estate is located in an incorporated area of the county, and
designation as a class 8a property is sought using the provisions of this
section, the municipality in which the real estate is located must provide to
the Cook County Assessor a resolution or ordinance that contains the
following:
a.

a finding by the municipality that it has determined that class 8a
designation of the property is necessary for the ongoing industrial or
commercial enterprise to continue its operations and that without
such designation the industrial or commercial enterprise would not
be economically viable causing the property to become vacant and
unused;

b.

a statement by the municipality that it supports and consents to the
action by the Cook County Board of Commissioners to support
designation of the property as a class 8a property;

c.

a statement by the municipality that it supports and consents to the
class 8a application to the Cook County Assessor; and

Real estate receiving a class 8a designation pursuant to the provisions of this
section shall be assessed at the lowest percentage of market value provided
for in Section 74-64 (11), however the term of the incentive will be limited to
five years only and such class 8a designation shall not be renewed.
a.

after the initial application has been approved and granted, if the
subject real estate receiving the class 8a designation pursuant to the
provisions of this section is sold or the applicant transfers ownership
of any portion of the property at any time prior to the five year term
of the 8a classification, then the property’s 8a classification shall be
subject to an eligibility review by the Cook County Board of
Commissioners, the municipality, and the Assessor under the
procedures set forth in this Ordinance for the remainder of the 5 year
term.

(5)

In order for real estate to qualify for a class 8a designation an eligibility
application must be made to the Cook County Assessor.

(6)

Class 8a designation can not be applied to real estate unless the following has
occurred: application is made to the Cook County Assessor; all required
municipal and county ordinances and resolutions are provided to the Cook
County Assessor; and the Cook County Assessor determines that the real
estate which is the subject of the application for a class 8a designation would
qualify for designation as a class 8 property but for the inability to comply
with the definition of abandonment pursuant to Sec.74-62(b).

1938

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 16, 2009
(7)

The Cook County Assessor may adopt rules consistent with this section to

(8)

Upon receipt of an eligibility application for a class 8a designation, the Cook

designation absent abandonment.

(9)

section shall not be eligible for a class 8a designation for any year prior to the
assessment year for which an application for the designation is made to the

(10)

The Cook County Board of Commissioners or its designee may adopt rules
consistent with this section that may be needed to ensure proper review of

lose such designation and the corresponding reduced level of assessment
upon termination of the required partial sales tax abatement by local

effective upon passage.

(b) Class 8b. Real estate that is used primarily for hospital purposes where the
property has been acquired for hospital use by an acquirer unrelated to the disposer, thereby
avoiding Illinois Health Facilities Planning Board discontinuation approval, shall be
considered for a class 8b designation if it meets the requirements of this section and the Cook
County Board of Commissioners provides a resolution or ordinance in support of such
designation.

(3)

(4)

a.

the applicant is a hospital as defined in the Hospital Licensing Act
that is licensed by the state, and the abandonment of the hospital
would require the applicant to obtain a permit or exemption from the
Illinois Health Facilities Planning Board pursuant to the Illinois
Health Facilities Planning Act prior to discontinuing its operations
and to obtain a second permit or exemption prior to re-opening or
otherwise re-establishing the hospital after abandonment; and

b.

the applicant demonstrated that approval of the class 8b designation
will materially increase the likelihood that the property will be
retained for hospital use with the associated employment benefits
relative to industrial or commercial use of the property.

Such a resolution or ordinance must contain:
a.

a finding that the Cook County Board of Commissioners has
determined that the applicant demonstrated that approval of the class
8b designation will materially increase the likelihood that the

section, the municipality in which the real estate is located must provide to
the Cook County Assessor a resolution or ordinance that contains the
following:
a.

a finding by the municipality that without a classification having the
impact of this section, special circumstances inherent to hospitals
including but not limited to efforts to continue treatments, maintain
access to emergency medical and other health care services, and the
unique requirement that mandates that hospital operations are
continually maintained without interruption in order for the Illinois
Health Facilities Planning Board to issue a permit and licensure
approval for the continued operation of the hospital, will not be
addressed and the hospital will become vacant and underutilized.

b.

a statement by the municipality finding a classification having the
impact of this section to be necessary for the redevelopment of the
subject hospital to occur; and

c.

a statement by the corporate authorities of municipality that they
support and consent to the filing of an application for a classification
having the impact of this section.

Real estate receiving a class 8b designation pursuant to the provisions of this

acquired for hospital use by an unrelated acquirer, avoiding the Illinois
Health Facilities Planning Board discontinuation approval, shall be
reconsidered as an application pursuant to this section upon supplement of
such class 8 application with the additional information required in this
section, if any. Upon receipt of an application, the Cook County Assessor
shall forward such application and any supporting documentation provided
with the application to the Cook County Board of Commissioners for
consideration as to whether the Cook County Board will provide a resolution
or ordinance in support of a class 8b designation. Real estate receiving a

Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Audit Committee of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County met pursuant to notice on
Tuesday, June 9, 2009 at the hour of 11:00 A.M. in the Board Room, Room 569, County Building, 118
North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois.
Chairman Daley entered into the record a corrected cover letter from Nicholas G. Grapsas, Public
Administrator, which corrected an error in the transmittal date by changing it from 2008 to 2009. (The
referenced documents are on file in the Office of the County Clerk.)
Your Committee has considered the following items and, upon adoption of this report, the
recommendations are as follows:
298605

FY2007 DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES (DHS) GRANT REPORT. Transmitting
a Communication, dated January 16, 2009 from Laura A. Burman, C.P.A., Cook County
Auditor:
submitting herewith a copy of the FY2007 Cook County Department of Human Services
(DHS) Grant Report. The Illinois Department of Human Services (DHS) requires annual
financial reporting from providers which receive funding from DHS. Included in Cook
County’s reporting package is the “Report on Agreed-Upon Procedures to Review Grant
Reports” issued by the Cook County Auditor.
* Referred to the Audit Committee on February 4, 2009.

Commissioner Butler, seconded by Commissioner Gainer, moved to receive and file
Communication No. 298605. The motion carried unanimously.
300313

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT. Transmitting a Communication, dated April 9,
2009 from Thomas J. Dart, Sheriff of Cook County by Alexis A. Herrera, Chief Financial
Officer:
submitting the Independent Auditor’s Report dated February 23, 2009 from Sam Macaluso &
Associates, Inc., Certified Public Accountants for the period ending November 30, 2008.
This audit report contains a Statement of Revenues Collected, Expenditures Paid and

Sharing Program administered by the Cook County Sheriff's Office.
* Referred to the Audit Committee on May 5, 2009.

Commissioner Peraica inquired as to the negative numbers on the balance sheet.

1948

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 16, 2009
Alexis A. Herrera, Chief Financial Officer for the Sheriff’s Office, stated the 2008 expenses exceeded the
revenue for that year, but such fluctuations are normal, and the overall balance remains positive. The
current fund balance is $657,000.00 in the federal account and in the State fund it is $1,166,727.00.
Commissioner Butler, seconded by Commissioner Gainer, moved to receive and file
Communication No. 300313. The motion carried unanimously.
300847

COOK COUNTY AUDITOR, by Laura A. Burman, transmitting a Communication, dated
May 27, 2009:
We are submitting herewith a copy of the Cook County Public Administrator Internal
Investigation report dated October 17, 2007 from McGovern & Greene LLP.
* Referred to the Audit Committee on June 2, 2009.

Nicholas G. Grapsas, Cook County Public Administrator, stated all relevant law enforcement agencies
related to the inquiry have been contacted including the Attorney General’s Office. He stated that he has
been advised that no further inquiry is pending. In the past, pending investigations had precluded his
office from releasing the audit.
Patrick T. Driscoll, Jr., Deputy State’s Attorney, Chief, Civil Actions Bureau, stated the Financial Crimes
and Governmental Corruption Unit of the State’s Attorney’s Office considered the available evidence and
declined to pursue an investigation, but did refer the matter to the Attorney General. The Deputy
Supervisor of the Financial Crimes and Governmental Corruption Unit indicated they would not pursue
any investigation, because the three year statute of limitation for state crimes has elapsed. In the federal
system, the limit is five years, with a ten year limit for certain types of bank fraud.
Commissioner Peraica objected to the fact that the statute of limitations had lapsed, thus preventing any
possible prosecution.
Commissioner Gorman inquired as to the payee’s relationship with the estate in the matter of the stolen
checks. Mr. Grapsas responded it was unclear, but it was determined that the payee was not an employee
of the previous public administrator.
Laura A. Burman, Cook County Auditor, stated no monies were transferred from the general funds of
Cook County at any time. The transfers in question were from dedicated reserve funds in the Public
Administrator’s Office, and were used for operating purposes when deficits were identified.
Chairman Daley requested that the Public Administrator provide a written statement regarding the nine
recommendations on page 18 of the independent auditor’s report. (The referenced documents are on file
in the Office of the County Clerk.)
At the request of the Public Administrator, a copy of his reply to a published report, co-signed by Ms.
Burman, is included in the record. (The referenced documents are on file in the Office of the County
Clerk.)
Commissioner Gorman, seconded by Commissioner Gainer, moved to receive and file
Communication No. 300847. The motion carried unanimously.
Chairman Daley asked the Secretary to the Board to call upon the registered public speaker, in accordance
with Cook County Code, Sec. 2-108 (dd Public Testimony):

IN OPPOSITION TO THE RELOCATION OF THE COOK COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF
PUBLIC HEALTH TO THE OAK FOREST HOSPITAL OF COOK COUNTY CAMPUS
(PROPOSED RESOLUTION). Submitting a Proposed Resolution sponsored by Peter N.
Silvestri and Earlean Collins, County Commissioners.
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
IN OPPOSITION TO THE RELOCATION OF THE
COOK COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH
TO THE OAK FOREST HOSPITAL OF COOK COUNTY CAMPUS
WHEREAS, the Cook County Department of Public Health has been located at its current
location at 1010 Lake Street in Oak Park, Illinois since 1992, having relocated from its
Maybrook County Courthouse facility for the purpose of providing additional courtrooms;
and
WHEREAS, the facility is centrally located in Cook County in downtown Oak Park,
accessible to the CTA Green Line and the Blue Line, the METRA railroad line and the
Eisenhower Expressway and numerous PACE and CTA bus lines; and
WHEREAS, the facility includes the Department’s administration offices, various
educational programs, and public information resources, which are utilized by municipalities,
public and private schools, community groups, the press and the public; and
WHEREAS, Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County is located in the far southwest section of
the County and is not nearly as accessible as the Oak Park location; and
WHEREAS, the Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County site requires the expenditure of public
funds, which far outweigh a long term rental of space in a central location; and
WHEREAS, the people of Cook County and their municipalities and schools are better
served in an accessible, central location, which has been utilized as such for the past
seventeen years.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and Board of Commissioners
direct that all efforts and expenditures planned for the relocation of the Cook County
Department of Public Health be terminated.

Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Murphy, moved to defer Communication No.
298604. The motion carried unanimously.
299986

AMENDMENT TO THE BOARD OF HEALTH ORDINANCE (PROPOSED
ORDINANCE AMENDMENT). Transmitting a Communication, dated March 30, 2009
from Stephen A. Martin, Jr. Ph.D., M.P.H., Chief Operating Officer, Department of Public
Health:
the Cook County Department of Public Health (CCDPH) respectfully requests the Board of
Commissioners approve the proposed amendment to the Cook County Board of Health
Ordinance.

1951

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 16, 2009
This proposed amendment serves two purposes. First, it clarifies the authority of the Cook
County Department of Public Health to require certain types of state-licensed providers
within the department's jurisdiction to participate in the electronic submission of syndromic
surveillance data. This data is extremely useful to the efforts of the Department in
communicable disease control and has the potential to alert us to an outbreak in its very early
stages, when intervention may be most effective. Many health providers currently participate
in this program on a voluntary basis and we would like to pursue participation arrangements
with more providers to improve our efforts in this very exciting program.
The second purpose of the proposed amendment is to memorialize authorizations, many of
which have been extended to the Department by the Board through Board Resolutions in the
past regarding various types of routine memoranda of agreement the Department periodically
needs to enter into. These agreements are typically programmatic in nature and do not
involve the establishment of fees, except to the extent that fees have been separately approved
by the Board and set forth in the schedule found at Chapter 32 Fees of the Cook County
Code.
Submitting a Proposed Ordinance Amendment sponsored by
TODD H. STROGER, President, JERRY BUTLER
and ELIZABETH “LIZ” DOODY GORMAN, County Commissioners
The following is a synopsis of the Proposed Ordinance Amendment:

the Cook County Code are hereby amended as follows:

SUBSTITUTE AMENDMENT FOR THE BOARD OF HEALTH ORDINANCE
PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT
Sponsored by
THE HONORABLE TODD H. STROGER, PRESIDENT, JERRY BUTLER
AND ELIZABETH “LIZ” DOODY GORMAN, COUNTY COMMISSIONERS
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of Cook County serves as the Board of
Health and as such oversees the regulatory and programmatic activities of the Cook
County Department of Public Health; and

1952

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 16, 2009
WHEREAS, the Cook County Department of Public Health engages in syndromic
surveillance activities, whereby it receives electronic transmissions of information
regarding chief complaints reported to emergency departments of area hospitals,
particularly those located within suburban Cook County; and
WHEREAS, syndromic surveillance program is an important public health tool with
the potential to assist in identifying measures that may reduce the severity of an
outbreak of communicable disease; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Department of Public Health wishes to assure
provider participation in this program through clarification of its authority to require
emergency departments and other providers, such as urgent care centers, to
participate in the syndromic surveillance program; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Department of Public Health participates in a large
number of community initiatives, emergency planning, and routine inspection
programs which are often memorialized in memoranda of agreement and the Board
has previously, through its proceedings including various resolutions, extended
authorization to the Chief Operating Officer of the Cook County Department of
Public Health to enter into such agreements; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Department of Public Health seeks to consolidate and
clarify its authorization to enter into various programmatic agreements consistent
with Board authorization or direction, in the Board of Health Ordinance.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of
Commissioners that Chapter 38, Article II, Sections 38-32 through 38-40 of the Cook
County Code are hereby amended as follows:

of the Circuit Court of Cook County has collected fees from civil filings for disbursement to the Dispute
Resolution Centers which qualify under said Act and General Order 19 of the Circuit Court of Cook
County. Fees available for disbursement from this Fund for the year 2008 total $258,740.00.
Upon review of applications received for funds collected in 2008, the sole qualifying applicant
under the requirements set forth in said Act and General Order 19 of the Circuit Court of Cook County
was found to be the Center for Conflict Resolution. It is eligible for the maximum amount allowable for
disbursement to any Dispute Resolution Center in a given year of $200,000.00.
Pursuant to the Illinois Not-For-Profit Dispute Resolution Act (710 ILCS 20/1 et seq.), any funds
collected but not disbursed in a given year shall be paid in single county judicial circuits to the County
Treasurer for the administration of justice in the judicial circuit. An amount of $58,740.00 remains
collected for the year 2008 but no other Dispute Resolution Center is qualified to receive disbursement of
these funds.
Therefore, it is hereby ordered that the amount of $200,000.00, representing the maximum
amount allowable for disbursement to any Dispute Resolution Center in a given year, shall be disbursed
to the Center for Conflict Resolution.
Further, it hereby ordered that the amount of $58,740.00 representing funds collected under the
Illinois Not-For-Profit Dispute Resolution Act for 2008 but not disbursed shall be paid to the Treasurer of
Cook County for the administration of justice in the Circuit Court of Cook County.
