Item No. 2

RECOMMENDATION TO APPROVE AN INTERGOVERNMENTAL
AGREEMENT WITH THE CITY OF CHICAGO FOR FUEL SUPPLY AND FLEET
MAINTENANCE
Presenter: Darlena Burnett, Deputy Chief, Fleet and Facilities Management
RECOMMENDATION:
The Chief Executive Officer recommends that the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing
Authority approve an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with the City of Chicago Department of
Fleet and Facility Management (Fleet) for fuel supply and vehicle maintenance, car wash, road and
towing services to the CHA for a five (5) base term effective July 1, 2019 through July 31, 2024 and for
compensation in an amount not-to-exceed $250,000.00.
In association with the requested approval for a new contract renewing the fuel and fleet service
amenities under the same general terms and conditions, the CHA additionally seeks the Board’s
formal approval and ratification of the short-term extension of the prior IGA (Contract #11386). The
short-term extension of the prior IGA was for time only, and covered the term from January 1, 2019
through June 30, 2019, as no additional funding was deemed necessary to continue the provision of
supplies and services without interruption through the date of the anticipated commencement of a
new IGA.
The Board action recommended in this item complies in all material respects with all applicable
Chicago Housing Authority Board policies and all applicable federal (HUD) procurement laws.
FUNDING
CHA General Fund
BACKGROUND
CHA’s most recent prior IGA for these fleet supply and service amenities (Contract #11386) was
authorized by the Board in November 2013 for a two (2) year base term with one (1) 3-year option to
renew the Agreement and with total compensation in an amount not to exceed $250,000.00.
The prior Intergovernmental Agreement was entered into to enable the CHA to fuel, maintain and
service its vehicles used for official CHA business. The CHA exercised the available option term under
Contract 11386 and then executed a short-term extension of the prior IGA on a “Time-Only” basis for

 six (6) months to continue the arrangements until replacement supply and services could be secured
under a new contract. Under this renewed arrangement, Fleet provides fuel supplies and vehicle
maintenance, car wash, road and towing services for CHA vehicles at the established Fleet rate(s).
While the CHA has closely monitored the prevailing fuel prices in the private market as they compare
with those of Fleet, it is determined that the prices extended to the CHA by Fleet remain considerably
lower than those available to the CHA in the private market. The cost of unleaded and diesel fuel at
a cost of $1.95 cents per gallon is lower than that if the CHA procured such fuel supplies and services
outside of the IGA relationship with Fleet. The price of car washes @ $7.00/per wash through the
Fleet vendor has remained constant; the need for maintenance and towing services, while all
inclusive, is minimal to none, and is flexibly utilized on an as-needed or emergency basis.
Respectfully Submitted,
