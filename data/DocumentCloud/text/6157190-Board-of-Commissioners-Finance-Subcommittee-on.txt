Summary: I am delighted to submit this letter of request for the City of Harvey’s interest in Cook County’s No
Cash Bid Program to the Cook County Board of Commissioners. There are a total of 79 Parcels listed in our
request and they are as follows. As indicated in Resolution 2772 and amended in Resolution 2775, the City of
Harvey requests 79 parcels of land for the redevelopment of our major thoroughfares and Downtown Business
District areas.
The City will retain legal counsel and pay all costs for tax deeds. Currently, the City has no “Third Party
Requestors.” The City will report as required to the Cook County Bureau Economic Development annually from
the date of sale on each parcel for five years or until the development is completed or whichever comes last. The
City will file for tax exempt status for PINs which will be used for municipal purposes or maintain the status until
tax deed(s) are conveyed to developers. If a City of Harvey lien is cleared by the no cash bid, the City agrees to
this in that the future redevelopment is more valuable to the City than the cost of the municipal lien. If a Cook
County lien is on a parcel, the City agrees to reinstate the lien after the tax sale for the County with an
intergovernmental agreement to be recorded.

Volume and Property Index Number:

Summary: The Village of Justice (the Village) hereby submits a No Cash Bid Request Package to acquire the
following parcel of real property located at 8801 West 84th Place, Justice, Illinois 60458 (the Property). The
Property is improved with a gasoline service station that has been abandoned and remained unoccupied for at
Page 7 of 11

 least two (2) years. The Village will file for tax exempt status once the Property has been acquired. Once tax
exempt status is obtained, the Village intends to demolish the gasoline service station improvements, remediate
environmental contamination, and possibly market the same for redevelopment by a third-party. If the Property is
sold and redeveloped by a third-party, it would no longer be exempt from taxation. The Village initiates this
request on its own, and there has been no request by a third-party for the Village to acquire the Property or to
convey the certificate of purchase or the perfected tax deed(s) to said third-party purchaser.
The Village will retain legal counsel to obtain the tax deed and bear all legal costs and other costs associated with
acquisition of the Property. The Village will submit annually to the Cook County Department of Economic
Development "No Cash Bid Reports" on the status of each parcel for five years, or until the intended use and
development is complete, whichever occurs last, as required by the Cook County No Cash Bid Ordinance.

PROPOSED NO CASH BID REQUEST
Requestor: Marilynn J. May, Village President, Village of River Grove
Request: Approval of No Cash Bid Request
Location:

Village of River Grove

Volume and Property Index Number:
067, 12-26-311-010-0000; 067, 12-26-311-012-0000; 067, 12-26-416-010-0000
Summary: Three (3) properties located within the Village of River Grove are currently tax-delinquent and
unoccupied, and the Village would therefore like to secure ownership of these properties through the Cook County
No Cash Bid Program and the 2015 Scavenger Sale. A list containing the volume number and full 14-digit
permanent index number (PIN) of each parcel requested is as follows. The total number of PINs requested in the
package is three (3). A statement of current and intended use for each PIN follows, but, the Village intends on
acquiring all three parcels for the development of public parking facilities: Common Address 2620 Thatcher
Avenue, River Grove, Illinois, 60171 Vol. 067 PIN 12-26-311-010-0000 currently contains multiple unoccupied,
neglected commercial structures. Vol. 067 PIN 12-26-311-012-0000 currently contains two unoccupied,
neglected structures, with one improvement being commercial and the other residential. Both parcels have not been
occupied for a period in excess of three (3) years. As mentioned above, the intended use of these parcels is the
development of public parking facilities. These two parcels are located near the business district and across from
the municipal building of the village. Currently, the business district suffers from a profound lack of parking for
owners, businesses and customers within the district. For this reason, the village plans to build a public parking lot
for village employees and the public on these parcels, which in turn would free up space in the village’s current
public parking lot immediately adjacent to the business district. This plan expands parking available to the owners,
employees and patrons of the businesses in the business district. The village believes that by increasing public
Page 8 of 11

 parking facilities, the commercial activity of the business district will be enhanced and greater sales-tax revenues
will be generated for both Cook County and the Village of River Grove. Common Address 8135 West Grand
Avenue, River Grove, Illinois, 60171 Vol. 067 PIN 12-26-416-010-0000. This parcel currently consists of an
obsolete, neglected unoccupied restaurant structure, and the improvement consumes the entire parcel with no on-site
parking facilities. This parcel has not been occupied for a period in excess of three (3) years. As mentioned above,
the intended use of this parcel would be the development of public parking facilities. The parcel is situated in the
middle of the Grand Avenue Business Corridor and offers a great opportunity to create additional public parking to
serve the business district. As previously stated, the village believes that by increasing public parking facilities
serving the business district, the commercial activity of the business district will be enhanced and greater sale-tax
revenues will be generated for both Cook County and the Village Rive Grove. Next, in accordance with the county
ordinance, on behalf of the Village of River Grove, I make the following representations and affirmations in support
of the Village’s Request Package: The Village shall file for tax exempt status on each parcel because the Village
intends on retaining these three parcels for municipal use. There is neither a Third Party Request nor a Third Party
Requestor with respect to these three parcels. The Village shall retain legal counsel to obtain the tax deeds and bear
all legal and other costs associated with acquisition of these three parcels. The Village agrees to submit to the Cook
County Department of Economic Development No Cash Bid Reports on the status of each parcel for five (5) year
or until development is complete, whichever occurs last, as required by the Cook County No Cash Bid Ordinance.
