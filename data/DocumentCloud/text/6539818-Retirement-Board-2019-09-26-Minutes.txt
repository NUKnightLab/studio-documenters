The Fund’s Executive Director, Erin Keane provided the following updates:
A draft funding resolution has been provided for review. This version was based on direction
received to make some changes; therefore, it is not on the September agenda. It is scheduled to
be on the agenda for next month, October. All feedback and questions from Trustees are
welcomed.

The next item was review of the healthcare for the employees and the retirees of this fund, which
expires December 1st. Therefore, by October 31st insurance must be renewed. The Executive
Director presented rates from the broker and represented that she and the Comptroller talked to
another broker about health insurance. The pricing was the same with both brokers. Overall this
year, the total insurance went down approximately 4 percent. There are nine retirees that are
currently using this plan coverage. The letter for retirees will indicate that any future increases
in the cost from BCBSIL will be their responsibilities.
It was moved by Trustee Wright, seconded by Trustee Lappe that the Board approve the healthcare
plan currently in place for Fund staff members and its retirees.

Next item to review and discuss are healthcare subsidy letters. Ms. Keane informed the Board
members that staff have been manually processing them for our Fund. As of date we have about
1.3 million in total of subsidy payments that we could make. This is not reflected on this month’s
docket for approval of that payment, however, upon Board approval, we could start sending people
their money. After discussion it was determined to make disbursements, when ready and reflect the
details on the docket for the next Board meeting. This should be the practice for the entire subsidy
project.
Proposed meeting dates for PABF Board meetings for 2020, were disbursed for review, to be
approved at the next meeting.
The last item; Recording Secretary Wright read into the record a resolution honoring Trustee
Carol L. Hamburger, which an engraved copy shall be presented to her.
All business concluded for this date, it was moved by Trustee Wodnicki, seconded by Trustee
