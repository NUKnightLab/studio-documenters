 Administrative Hearings – FY2013 Accomplishments
FY2014 Budget Presentation

• Increased the number of County Departments that are connected to the case management
system which allows for more productive use of staff time and allows each client agency to
better monitor their caseload. Rather than make a formal request for case updates or for
copies of a docket, new client agencies are able to get that information directly from the
source.
• Restructured the docketing system to better handle the cigarette cases. By separating
arraignment matters from the cases that are ready to be tried, the Department of Revenue can
better allocate its investigators so they are not waiting for a hearing that may or may not be
heard. The separate dockets also allow the Office of the State’s Attorney to better prepare or
negotiate the matters brought before Administrative Hearings.
• Commenced the adjudication of old automobile use tax cases which assists the Department of
Revenue in eliminating the backlog of uncollected taxes. By increasing the caseloads that can
be heard to 500 cases per day with one hearing day set every two weeks, the backlog of cases
is diminishing rapidly.

FY2014 Budget Presentation

• New Public Nuisance Offenses – Recently, the County Board enacted a series of County
violations that are adjudicate in the Department of Administrative Hearings that are intended to
reduce the occurrence of public nuisances experienced by constituents
• Human Rights Hearings – By absorbing the administrative hearings component of the
Commission on Human Rights, the County can experience a $30,000 savings
• Recorder of Deeds – Pursuant to a new state law, fraudulent deeds and liens can be declared
invalid by Administrative Hearing, allowing constituents a practical way to free themselves from
nuisance and costly filings against their property
• Procurement Disqualification Enhancement – Working with the CPO and the Independent
Inspector General, the County and its vendors have a fair process of determining when a
disqualification by the Chief Procurement Officer can occur.
