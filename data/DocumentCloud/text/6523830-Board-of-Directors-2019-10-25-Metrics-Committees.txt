 

 

Observations on Financials
 Net Patient Service Revenues - $506M, 6% unfavorable to target due to increasing and unsustainable growth in
charity care, some lower clinical activity and lower revenue cycle activity
•

System-wide uninsured numbers
•

Captured by Visits, held at 44%

•

Captured by Charges, held at 40%

 CountyCare Capitation Revenues - $1.3B, 5% unfavorable to target due to lower than budgeted enrollment as a
result of lower State/County MCO enrollment
 Other Revenues - $13M , trending to exceed FY2019 target

 Cost of Pharma - $63M, unfavorable by 3% compared to budget and closely monitored/managed to get to target

Impact 2020 – Develop Cultural Competency of Workforce
The Changing Landscape - Benchmark
• According to the US Census Bureau:
 The minority population increased from 32.9% of U.S. residents in 2004 to 37.9% in 2014.
 Chicago’s minority population is 54.7%.
 The percentage of minorities in America is projected to exceed 50% by 2056

• A 2015 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, found that 22% of adults in the US
have some form of a disability.
 The study also found Black (29%) and Hispanic (25.9%) adults were more likely to have a
disability than were White (20.6%) adults (CSC newsroom, 2015).
• A 2016 U.S. Gallup Poll of the largest representative sample of LGBT Americans found that more than
an estimated 10 million adults now identify as :GBT om the U.S. today, approximately 1.75 million
more compared with 2012. This is an increase from 3.5% in 2012 to 4.1% in 2016.
LGBT millennials rose from 5.8% in 2012 to 7.3% in 2016 (Gates,2017)>

Implicit Bias Defined

Biases are the intentional or unintentional beliefs
based on stereotypes that cause someone to

not be true, which enables the favorable or
unfavorable treatment of said person or group.

Implicit biases are:

Attitudes or stereotypes that unconsciously
affect our understanding, actions, and decisions.

- Activated involuntarily and without our
awareness or intentional control.

CY19 Q2

SIR (Standardized Infection Ratio) is a summary
measure which compares the actual number of
Healthcare Associated Infections (HAI) in a facility
with the baseline data for standard population. SIR >
1.0 indicates more HAIs were observed than predicted,
conversely SIR of < 1.0 indicates that fewer HAIs were
observed than predicted.
