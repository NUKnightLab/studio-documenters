Report from System Director of Human Resources
Deborah Tate, Director of Human Resources for the Cook County Health and Hospitals System, presented an
update on hiring goals and the recruiting process transformation. She stated that two key positions have
recently been filled; Gina Goodson-Allen will be the new Nurse Recruiter, and Naisha Denegal will be filling
the position of Human Resources Generalist, effective October 12, 2009.
Ms. Tate referenced the weekly Human Resources staff meetings that are occurring. As part of that, MedAssets
and Lawson staff are included so they can be provided the information they need and so that there is an
understanding of where they are in the project cycle.
Director Golden inquired regarding whether the System is posting information on their website relating to open
positions for which MedAssets is hiring. She stated that in previous meetings, there was a discussion on that
subject. Although these would be MedAssets’ employees, the intent was to assist in providing for the greatest
opportunity to cast a wide net through multiple resources to draw in the most qualified and diverse applicants
for these positions located at the System.
Ms. Tate stated that she would follow up with MedAssets on the subject, and would report back to the
Committee.

Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
A. Update and discussion of pending information requests
Chairman Zopp stated that there were no pending information requests at this time.

B. Presentation on Recruitment Transformation/Taleo Implementation
Joseph Sova, Chief of the Cook County Bureau of Human Resources, provided an introduction to the
presentation on the Taleo Implementation. In order to address issues relating to automation, inefficiencies,
and Shakman compliance requirements, Cook County has identified a vendor, Taleo, whose automated
recruiting, hiring, and onboarding system is currently used by the City of Chicago, as well as by 147
companies in the Fortune 500. He introduced Jim Montrie, Senior Regional Manager for Taleo, who would
be giving a brief presentation on the system.
Mr. Montrie proceeded with the presentation (Attachment #1).
Mr. Sova stated that the request to enter into a contract with Taleo is expected to be on the October 6th Cook
County Board agenda for approval. He added that the funding for the system has already been budgeted.
With regard to the timing of such implementation, he estimated that it would be roughly four to six months
after the contract is signed.
Chairman Zopp inquired whether the Cook County Health and Hospitals System would be a separate unit
within the Taleo system. Mr. Sova responded that the System would be considered a “business partner.” At
the onset, he envisions a tag-team approach. Once the Taleo system is up and running, he stated that the
system would be theirs; the System would be autonomous, having direct contact with Taleo.
Chairman Zopp stated that there needs to be an interim plan to address hiring changes until the Taleo system
is up and running, if implementation of this system won’t happen until at least next Summer.
Mr. Foley mentioned that the System also needs to install a new time and attendance system. He asked Mr.
Sova if the County is planning a time/attendance system installation in the near future. Mr. Sova responded
that he was unaware of any plans.
