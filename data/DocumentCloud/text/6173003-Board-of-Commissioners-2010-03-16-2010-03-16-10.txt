GENERAL BACKGROUND
In order to effectively complete all capital construction, rehabilitation, modernization,
environmental and demolition activities in conjunction with the Chicago Housing Authority’s
(“CHA”) Plan for Transformation, the CHA requires a full service professional Construction
Management (“CM”) firm to provide all necessary program and construction services related to
these activities. These activities include, but are not limited to, program management, strategic
planning, reporting, scheduling, design management, procurement development, construction
administration, construction monitoring, including site work, and observation, change orders,
claim resolution, payment processing, close-out and warranty, cost estimating and budgeting
analysis and consulting services at various properties within the CHA’s portfolio.
The CM will directly report to the CHA’s Vice President for the Capital Construction
Department.
PROCUREMENT HISTORY
The CHA advertised Request for Proposal No. 09 – 00403 (“RFP”) on November 23, 2009 for
Authority-wide construction management services for the Plan for Transformation in the
Chicago Sun-Times, the Chicago Defender and Extra, on the CHA’s website, and at BuySpeed
Online. The CHA also directly solicited two hundred twenty-five (225) firms, including thirtynine (39) M/W/DBE firms. Eighty-six (86) firms picked up copies of the solicitation. Addendum
No. 1 was issued on December 11, 2009 to respond to Requests for Information (“RFI”) and
distribute a job description for the Field Manager position and a list of private property managers
and their assignments. Addendum No. 2 was issued on December 14, 2009 to answer one (1)
remaining RFI. The CHA received eight (8) proposals on December 21, 2009. An Evaluation
Committee, consisting of four (4) staff members chosen from the Office of Development
Management, Finance Division, Asset Management and the Legal Department, reviewed and
scored the written proposals.
Four (4) Respondents were found to be in the competitive range, which was set by CHA’s
Contracting Officer. The Four (4) Respondents, Bovis Lend Lease, AECOM, Jones Lang LaSalle
and Partnership for Transformation were invited to make presentations and hold discussions with
the CHA. After further evaluations following the presentations and discussions with the four
Respondents, the Contracting Officer set a second competitive range narrowing the field to
AECOM and the Partnership for Transformation. Upon further consideration following
additional discussions with these two firms, the Capital Construction Department concluded that
Partnership for Transformation provides the best overall combination of expertise, knowledge,

 understanding, competence, ability and cost. The Partnership for Transformation is a joint
venture consisting of McKissack & McKissack Midwest, Inc., The Rise Group, LLC and URS
Corporation.
Based upon the foregoing, it is in the best interest of the CHA to execute a contract for

amount not-to-exceed $2,975,581.00. The contract will be awarded for a one (1) year base period
with two (2) one (1) year renewal options. The amount of the first one (1) year renewal option is
not-to-exceed $2,382,325.00 and the amount of the second one (1) year renewal option is not-toexceed $1,915,847.00.
This award is subject to the firm’s compliance with CHA’s M/W/DBE, Section 3 resident hiring,
and bonding and insurance requirements.
