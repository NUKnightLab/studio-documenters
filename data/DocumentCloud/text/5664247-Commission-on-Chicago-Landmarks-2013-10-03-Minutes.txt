1501-03 N. Milwaukee
(Milwaukee Avenue District – 1st Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed demolition of a 2-story frame building.

Action:

The Committee reviewed the pre-permit application based on Article III of
the Commission’s Rules and Regulations, which includes “Criteria for
Determining a Contributing Building within a Landmark District”. At the
meeting, the Committee unanimously adopted the following findings:
(A) Find that, pursuant to the Milwaukee Avenue District Designation
Ordinance designating the Milwaukee Avenue District a Chicago
Landmark on April 9, 2008, for permits for demolition only, the
significant historical and architectural features of the district are
identified as all exterior elevations and roofs, regardless of visibility
from public rights-of-way; and,
(B) Preliminarily find that the subject building, a 2-story frame building
constructed in 1881, contributes to the character of the Milwaukee
Avenue District, which includes commercial buildings in a wide
variety of architectural styles built in the late nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries; and,
(C) Preliminarily find that the demolition of a contributing building or
structure within a landmark district is a per se adverse effect on the
significant historical and architectural features, pursuant to Article III,
Section G.3.b., of the Rules and Regulations; and,
(D) Pursuant to Section 2-120-780 of the Landmarks Ordinance,
preliminarily find that the demolition of the subject property will
adversely affect and destroy significant historical and architectural
features of the property and the district.
Should Historic Preservation staff receive a wrecking application for the
subject building, staff shall issue a preliminary disapproval of the
application. A preliminary disapproval of the application would trigger an
informal conference and, if the informal conference does not reach an
accord, a public hearing on the permit application would be scheduled in
accordance with the provisions of the Chicago Landmarks Ordinance.

6.

1505 N. Milwaukee
(Milwaukee Avenue District – 1st Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed new construction of a 4-story masonry commercial and
residential building.

 Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. The masonry façade design shall be modified to provide a more
substantial coping or cornice at the parapet, and lintels and sills shall
be incorporated at the masonry openings to be more compatible with
the architectural character of the historic properties of the district;
2. The proposed canted metal surround of the storefront shall be
eliminated, and the storefront glazing shall extend to the perimeter of
the opening, typical of proportions and arrangement of historic
storefronts in the district. Recesses in the storefront shall be limited to
entries only. The storefront design shall incorporate a 1’-2’-tall
masonry or metal-paneled knee wall below the display windows.
Enlarged details of the storefront system shall be included in the
permit plans; and,
3. Exterior wall material samples reviewed at the Committee meeting are
approved as proposed. The exposed masonry wall on the north (side)
from the 3rd-floor to the parapet shall be clad with face brick to match
the (front) Milwaukee Avenue façade.
