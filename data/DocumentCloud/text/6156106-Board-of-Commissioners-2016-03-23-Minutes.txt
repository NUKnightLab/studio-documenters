PROPOSED ORDINANCE
AN ORDINANCE PROHIBITING THE SALE OF SECOND HAND CATALYTIC CONVERTERS
WHEREAS, since 1975, all motor vehicles produced in the United States are required to have a catalytic
converter as part of the exhaust system. The catalytic converter is an emissions control device containing
precious metals, such as platinum, palladium or rhodium, that act as catalysts. A catalytic converter is
vehicle emissions control device that converts toxic pollutants in the exhaust gas of motor vehicles into Jess
harmful fumes; and
WHEREAS, with the price of precious metal skyrocketing, such as platinum, which is $936.10 an ounce,
palladium, which is $536.30 an ounce, and rhodium which is $760 an ounce, thieves have acquired an
Page 40 of 212

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

March 23, 2016

interest in stealing catalytic converters, which they then pawn or sell to junk peddlers, second hand dealers,
motor vehicle repair shops, and recycling facilities for a fraction of the converter's cost. Stolen catalytic
converters typically reap the thief a profit of $100.00 to $150.00, while, depending on the make and model
of the vehicle, it costs the vehicle owner between $1,000.00 and $2,000.00 to replace; and
WHEREAS, vehicles that sit higher from the ground, such as trucks, pick-up trucks and SUVs, are
particularly vulnerable to catalytic converter theft because thieves can access the converter simply by
sliding underneath the vehicle without having to jack it up. With just a few cuts of a battery-powered saw,
a catalytic converter can be removed from a vehicle in less than a minute; and
WHEREAS, catalytic converter theft typically happens to vehicles that are parked for prolonged periods
in large parking lots, such as shopping centers, mass transit commuter lots or company parking lots.
However, vehicles parked on City streets are not immune from such theft, as police blotters are riddled with
reports of stolen catalytic converters; and
WHEREAS, because catalytic converters are not marked with the vehicle's VIN number, they are not
readily traceable to the vehicle's owner, making them easy fodder for theft and illegal resale; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Commissioners seeks to deter catalytic converter theft by making it more
difficult for thieves to sell stolen catalytic converters in Cook County; and
WHEREAS, by implementing a ban on the sale of secondhand catalytic converters, Cook County would
effectively become a dry County in the resale market of catalytic converters.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that Chapter 58
Offenses and Miscellaneous Provisions, Article II Offenses Involving Property Rights, Section 58-48
Special Handling of Catalytic Converters, is hereby enacted as follows:
ARTICLE II. - OFFENSES INVOLVING PROPERTY RIGHTS

Summary: A contract with Capita Technologies, Inc. is requested to develop and implement a new
comprehensive case management infonnation system for the Adult Probation Department and the Social
Service Department to track probation and pretrial operations as well as related cashier and contract
monitoring. The case management system is necessary to replace the departments' outdated case
management system, PROMIS (Prosecutor's Management Information System), which resides on the
Cook County mainframe. PROMIS was designed in the 1970s and is antiquated, limited in its
functionality, and cumbersome to use. Also, it is no longer supported by the company that designed it.
The two departments currently supervise about 40,000 probationers and pretrial defendants. The Adult
Probation Department also completes approximately 33,000 pretrial bond assessments per year and over
3,000 presentence investigations. The new system will help to improve supervision of probationers and
pretrial defendants, upgrade the quality of information provided to the court, and enhance public safety.
Specifically, the new system will achieve the following: increase efficiency in case management tasks;
reduce redundancy in data entry; improve quality assurance, program evaluation, and workload
management; improve financial auditing and contract monitoring processes; enhance security and data
tracking; and increase the departments' ability to integrate with other systems within and outside of Cook
County government.

needs of the juveniles who are referred to participate in this project. Heartland partners with 14
faith-based and other community organizations to facilitate direct access to services and care. Since the
beginning of the project, more than 2,500 referrals have been processed for DRP services.
This contract was renewed with the approval of the Cook County Board in 2014 and 2015. A Request for
Proposal (RFP) is now in development to provide DRP services countywide.

WHEREAS, the Cook County Classification System for Assessment defines abandoned property as
buildings and other structures that, after having been vacant and unused for at least 24 continuous months,
have been purchased for value by a purchaser in whom the seller has no direct financial interest; and
WHEREAS, in the instance where the property does not meet the definition of abandoned property, the
municipality or the Board of Commissioners, may detennine that special circumstances may exist that
justify finding that the property is abandoned for purpose of Class 8; and
WHEREAS, in the case of abandonment of less than 24 months and purchase for value, by a purchaser in
whom the seller has no direct financial interest, the County may determine that special circumstances justify
finding the property is deemed abandoned; and
WHEREAS, Class 8 requires the validation by the County Board of the shortened period of qualifying
abandonment in cases where the facility has been abandoned for less than 24 consecutive months upon
purchase for value; and

real estate eligible for the Class 8 can receive a significant reduction in the level of assessment from the
date that new construction or rehabilitation has been completed, or in the case of abandoned property from
the date of substantial re-occupancy. Properties receiving Class 8 will be assessed at 10% of the market
value for 10 years, 15% for the 11th year and 20% in the 12th year.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the President and Board of Commissioners of the County

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
Sponsored by: RIC HARD R. BOYKJN, County Commissioner
CALLING UPON THE CITY OF CHICAGO TO RESCIND THE $0.05 BOTTLED WATER TAX
WHEREAS, in the aftennath of the water supply crisis in Flint, Michigan, an increasing level of public
concern is being expressed in communities throughout Chicago and Cook County about the age of the
water-related infrastructure and the content of the water suppl y in Chicago and Cook County, including
whether or not there are quantities of lead present in that water supply; and,
WHEREAS, much like the water delivery infrastructure in Flint, Michigan, the water delivery
infrastructure in many parts of the City of Chicago and Cook County is rapidly aging and composed
primarily of lead pipe; and,
WHEREAS, there exist clear and numerous pieces of scientific evidence demonstrating that exposure to
lead causes significant neurological and developmental damage to babies, toddlers and children, and that
the effects of that damage include higher rates of developmental delay, learning disabilities, and hearing
loss; and,
WHEREAS, there exist clear and numerous pieces of scientific evidence demonstrating that lead exposure
in adults can lead to mood disorders, decline in mental functioning, miscarriage and infertility, as well as
an increased risk of cancer; and,
WHEREAS, recent analysis indicates that while the lead pipes that supply water to most of the City of
Chicago and Cook County generally pose only a slight health risk, recent construction projects which
disturb the water lines around the County have caused the risk to increase; and,
WHEREAS, many infonned residents of the City of Chicago and Cook County, in the light of the
aforementioned risks, choose to drink bottled water rather than tap water; and,
WHEREAS, many Chicago and Cook County residents with low and moderate household incomes rely
upon bottled water as their cleanest source of drinking water, as an installation of a water filtration system
in their homes is cost-prohibitive; and,
WHEREAS, the City of Chicago should recognize the reality that large numbers of its citizens rely on
bottled water, and must purchase that bottled water commercially; and,

Page 206 of212

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

March 23, 2016

WHEREAS, the existing five-cent per bottle tax on bottled water imposed by the City of Chicago is
regressive, in that it disproportionately impacts citizens of Cook County and Chicago with the least
disposable income; and,
WHEREAS, rescinding the five-cent per bottle tax will make bottled water more affordable to lower
income residents who rely on bottled water for purposes of ensuring a clean drinking water source for their
families; and,
WHEREAS, it is right and proper for the Cook County Board of Commissioners to opine and advocate on
matters that affect the health and welfare of the citizens of Cook County.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and Cook County Board of Commissioners
do hereby call upon the City of Chicago to rescind the five-cent bottled water tax, to ensure that the citizens
of the City of Chicago and Cook County have a more affordable source of clean, healthy drinking water.

A motion was made by Commissioner Boykin, seconded by President Pro Tempore Steele, that this
Resolution be referred to the Human Relations Committee. The motion carried.
