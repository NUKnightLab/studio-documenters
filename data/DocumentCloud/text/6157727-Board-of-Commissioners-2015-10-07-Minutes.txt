cancer, besides lung cancer; and

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

Requestor: Keith R. Sbiral, AICP, Village Manager, Village of Brookfield
Request: Approval of No Cash Bid Request
Location:

Village of Brookfield

Volume and Property Index Number:
176, 15-34-221-004-0000; 176, 15-34-221-005-0000
Summary: The Village of Brookfield, Illinois (the “Village”), hereby requests an over-the-counter
no-cash bid for the following parcels. This Request Package contains two (2) PIN’s. The two
above-referenced parcels are collectively referred to herein as the “Property”. The Property is comprised
of two (2) adjacent parcels located at 3415 Maple Avenue, Brookfield, Illinois 60513. The Property is a
dilapidated parking lot. No structures exist on the Property. In October of 2014, by means of the Cook
County No-Cash Bid Program, the Village acquired title to the parcel immediately south of the requested
Property, which is improved with an unoccupied and dilapidated single-story commercial structure
formerly used as a bowling alley. The Village seeks to acquire and hold the Property for redevelopment
pending a future proposal by a yet-to-be-determined developer for commercial use of the Property and
adjacent parcel. Acquisition of the Property through the Cook County No-Cash Bid Program will benefit
the Village by increasing the potential for a commercial development on the Property, and the adjacent
parcel owned by the Village, by providing a larger contiguous parcel and adequate off-street parking.
Commercial development of the Property will benefit the Village by increasing the Village’s property tax
base and by offering additional employment opportunities to local residents.
If the Village is successful in acquiring the Property through the No-Cash Bid Program, it will file for tax
exempt status and will maintain the Property as tax exempt until such time as it is conveyed to a third
party for development. The Village represents that there currently exists no Third Party Request by a
developer, organization, or other private party which would result in the Village’s conveyance of
certificates of purchase for, or perfected tax deeds to, the Property to such a developer, organization, or
private party. The Village will bear all legal and other costs associated with the acquisition of these
parcels. The Village agrees to submit an annual report on the status of these parcels for five (5) years or
until development is complete, whichever occurs last, as required by the Cook County No-Cash Bid
Ordinance, to the Cook County Bureau of Economic Development, 69 West Washington Street, Suite
2900, Chicago, Illinois 60602.

Summary: I am delighted to submit this letter of request for the City of Harvey’s interest in Cook
County’s No Cash Bid Program to the Cook County Board of Commissioners. There are a total of 79
Parcels listed in our request and they are as follows. As indicated in Resolution 2772 and amended in
Resolution 2775, the City of Harvey requests 79 parcels of land for the redevelopment of our major
thoroughfares and Downtown Business District areas.
The City will retain legal counsel and pay all costs for tax deeds. Currently, the City has no “Third Party
Requestors.” The City will report as required to the Cook County Bureau Economic Development
annually from the date of sale on each parcel for five years or until the development is completed or
whichever comes last. The City will file for tax exempt status for PINs which will be used for municipal
purposes or maintain the status until tax deed(s) are conveyed to developers. If a City of Harvey lien is
cleared by the no cash bid, the City agrees to this in that the future redevelopment is more valuable to the
City than the cost of the municipal lien. If a Cook County lien is on a parcel, the City agrees to reinstate
the lien after the tax sale for the County with an intergovernmental agreement to be recorded.

decedents brought to the Medical Examiner's Office and the Medical Examiner's service to the
residents of Cook County. The Medical Examiner's Office shall provide administrative support as
necessary.
Sec. 38-13342. - Death caused by wrongful act; liability for expenses incurred.
Any person, individual, partnership, corporation, firm, company, trust, estate, political subdivision,
state agency, or any other legal entity who causes the death of a decedent by a wrongful act, carelessness,
or negligence which shall be subject to a Medical Examiner's investigation shall be liable to pay any and

recoverable by the county.

obligation to arrange for transportation of bodies to the Medical Examiner's facility.
Sec. 38-13544. - Fees.
The Medical Examiner shall charge the following fees with the amounts as set in Section 32-1 of this
Code.
(1) Autopsy report.
(2) Toxicology report.
(3) Miscellaneous reports, including artist's drawings, but not including police reports.

facsimile or electronic filing, unless the Medical Examiner determines that the decedent and the
authorized person is indigent and unable to pay the permit fee, or other special circumstances
warrant fee waiver in the Medical Examiner’s discretion.
(5) Return fee. The return fee is charged to funeral homes that pick up bodies from the Medical
Examiner's Office and then request to return them to the Office after determining that the family
has no funds for burial. This cost would include the cost of the burial shell and the burial cost.

to verify that families have funds for burial prior to removing a body from the Office of the
Medical Examiner. In the cases of funeral homes, this "storage fee" would replace the "return fee"

operating procedures of the Medical Examiner.

jurisdiction of the Medical Examiner.

procurement per body by a tissue procurement facility or program authorized by the Medical

(12) Student and resident rotation fee. Fee charged to institutions outside of Cook County providing
student and resident rotations at the Medical Examiner's Office to offset the County's costs for
disposable supplies as well as the staff time supervising the student rotation.
(13) Staff supervision of external experts. Fee charged to individuals requesting to review slides,
images and/or records at the Medical Examiner's Office to offset staff costs for supervising such
review.

circumstances warrant fee waiver in the Medical Examiner’s discretion.

Summary: TASC will provide clinical professional services to probationers reporting to the Adult
Probation Department as part of their participation in the Circuit Court of Cook County’s Drug

substance abuse treatment needed and recommendations for appropriate treatment placements from the
provider network. TASC also develops individualized treatment plans, monitors participants’ attendance

designated by the State.

CRIMINAL JUSTICE COMMITTEE MEETING OF OCTOBER 7 2015
15-5254
ORDINANCE
Sponsored by
THE HONORABLE RICHARD R. BOYKIN
AND PETER N. SILVESTRI, COUNTY COMMISSIONERS
REPLICA FIREARMS ORDINANCE
BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners, that Chapter 54, Article XII of the
Cook County Code is hereby enacted as follows:
ARTICLE XII. REPLICA FIREARMS
Sec. 54-420. Replica guns.
(a) Title. This division shall be known and may be cited as the “Replica Firearms Ordinance” of
Cook County, Illinois.
(b) Purpose and Policy. Like other major cities across America, the Cook County Government
faces the ongoing challenge of combating the scourge of gun violence in our communities. Many
imitation and replica firearms are manufactured in a manner that makes them nearly indistinguishable
from working firearms; and imitation and replica firearms pose the greatest threat to mistakes in the use
of force by police. Several foreign manufactured mobile phone cases which have the appearance of 9mm
handguns have recently appeared for sale on several online retail outlets, and the one "Gun Grip Case"
features the grip of an actual gun and trigger guard attached to the housing of a phone cover. When placed
in a pocket, this product is indistinguishable from a working handgun. Law enforcement officials from
New York, New Jersey and Michigan among others have advised people not to purchase or use this
product. Numerous incidents have been reported by law enforcement officers across the country who
have mistakenly identified imitation or replica firearms to be working handguns.

(c) It shall be unlawful for any person to purchase, possess, conceal, use, sell, give away or
otherwise transfer, or to engage in the business of selling or to exhibit for sale, a replica firearm in Cook
County, except as provided in subsection (e) of this section.
(d) Definitions. For the purposes of this chapter, the following terms shall have the following
meanings:
Replica firearm means any device, object or facsimile made of plastic, wood, metal or any other material,
that a person could reasonably perceive as an actual firearm but that is incapable of being fired or
discharged, including, but not limited to mobile phone cases, lighters, and cameras, except that the term
shall not include any replica of an antique firearm. Each such replica firearm shall have as an integral
part, permanently affixed, a blaze orange plug inserted in the barrel of such replica firearm. Such plug
shall be recessed no more than six millimeters from the muzzle end of the barrel of such firearm.
(e) Exceptions. The manufacture, marketing, distribution, sale and possession of replica firearms
are permitted if the devices are manufactured, marketed, distributed, sold or held solely for subsequent
transportation in intrastate, interstate or foreign commerce. Such devices shall not be displayed to the
general public or sold for other use in the County
(f) Violation. Any person who violates the provisions of this section, upon conviction thereof,
shall be fined not less than $100.00 nor more than $750.00 for each offense. All actions seeking the
imposition of fines only shall be filed as quasi-criminal actions subject to the provisions of the Illinois
Code of Civil Procedure, Illinois Revised Statutes, Chapter 110, Section 1-101, et seq. (1985), as
amended. Each purchase, use, sale, gift or transfer of any such replica firearm, shall be deemed a separate
and distinct offense, and each day a person unlawfully engages in the business of selling or exhibits for
sale any such replica firearm, paint pellet or paint pellet gun shall be deemed a separate and distinct
offense.
Effective date: This ordinance shall be in effect immediately upon adoption.
..
Approved and adopted this 7th of October 2015.

ORGAN DONOR LEAVE POLICY
WHEREAS, the need for potentially life-saving organ and bone marrow transplants far exceeds the supply;
and
WHEREAS, the State of Illinois has recognized the importance of organ donation by providing the
opportunity for paid leave to State employees who donate an organ or bone marrow; and
WHEREAS, like Illinois, many other jurisdictions have attempted to offset the incidental costs associated
withtim donation and protect employees from retaliation for taking leave to donate an organ by passing
legislation providing job-protected, paid leave to employees who donate organs or bone marrow; and
WHEREAS, Cook County currently does not provide job-protected, paid leave for the purpose of organ or
bone marrow donation, necessitating employees to use their accrued sick and vacation leave or take unpaid
personal leave, if eligible; and
WHEREAS, in order to offset the incidental costs associated with donation and protect employees from
retaliation for taking a leave of absence to donate an organ, all Cook County agencies and offices should
afford paid leave to employees who donate organs or bone marrow; and
WHEREAS, the President’s Office and the Bureau of Human Resources have researched various organ
donor leave policies and as a result, the Bureau of Human Resources has developed an Organ Donor Leave
Policy that will provide job-protected, paid leave for the purpose of organ or bone marrow donation; and
WHEREAS, the proposed policy would be available to all eligible Cook County employees (employed
with the County for at least twelve (12) months) who donate organs or donate bone marrow via surgical
aspiration or non-surgical apheresis; and
WHEREAS, the risk of complications and death, as well as the burden to the donor in terms of recovery
time, pain, and suffering is lowest for apheresis donation and greatest for organ donation; and
WHEREAS, an eligible employee who donates bone marrow via non-surgical apheresis would receive five

Page 245 of 274

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

October 7, 2015

(5) days of paid leave within a twelve (12) month period; and
WHEREAS, an eligible employee who donates bone marrow via surgical aspiration would receive fifteen
(15) days of paid leave within a twelve (12) month period; and
WHEREAS, an eligible employee who donates an organ would receive thirty (30) days of paid donor leave
within a twelve (12) month period; and
WHEREAS, the Bureau of Human Resources shall adopt and circulate the Organ Donor Leave Policy to
all Cook County agencies and offices as this policy will not only benefit our employees and their families
but also the County’s overall mission.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and Board of Commissioners of Cook
County does hereby direct the Chief of the Bureau of Human Resources to implement an Organ Donor
Leave Policy with an effective date of September 1, 2015; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that all Cook County agencies and offices receive a copy of the Organ
Donor Leave Policy issued by the Chief of the Bureau of Human Resources; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that all Cook County agencies and offices which shall include but not
be limited to the offices under the Cook County Board President, Cook County Board of Commissioners,
Cook County State’s Attorney, Cook County Sheriff, Clerk of the Circuit Court of Cook County, Cook
County Board of Review, Cook County Assessor, Cook County Public Defender, Chief Judge of the
Circuit Court, Cook County Public Administrator, Cook County Recorder of Deeds, Cook County Health

RESOLUTION IN SUPPORT OF “WE DON’T SERVE TEENS,” AN INITIATIVE BY THE
FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION, CONSTELLATION BRANDS BEER DIVISION, AND
COOK COUNTY BEER DISTRIBUTORS AND RETAILERS TO ENLIST PARENTS AND
OTHER ADULTS TO FIGHT UNDERAGE DRINKING
WHEREAS, thousands of younger residents of Cook County are back in middle schools, high schools,
colleges, and universities in September, beginning a year of great promise and opportunity to advance in
learning, forge new friendships, and look toward the future; and
WHEREAS, for several years, Cook County has recognized the Federal Trade Commission’s “We Don’t
Serve Teens” consumer education campaign as a valuable resource to raise awareness among parents,
educators, and other adults of actions they can take to reduce illegal underage drinking and the
well-documented hazards caused by underage drinking to teens and to the general public; and
WHEREAS, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) released its
analysis of the most recent National Survey on Drug Use and Health, which shows a sustained decline in
alcohol abuse and underage drinking and stressed parental involvement as an effective means of combating
illegal underage drinking; and
WHEREAS, SAMHSA also highlighted a new app called “Talk, They Hear You”, designed to help parents
talk with younger teens about the dangers of underage drinking and to promote a message consistent with
the We Don’t Serve Teens; and
WHEREAS, recently published research conducted by the University of Illinois-Chicago found that
adolescents who engage in binge drinking may disrupt gene regulation and brain development in ways that
promote anxiety and excessive drinking behaviors; and those findings are consistent with many prior
studies showing that persons drinking before the age of 15 are up to four times more likely to meet the
criteria for alcohol dependence at some point in their lives than those who delay drinking until age 21; and

Page 257 of 274

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

October 7, 2015

WHEREAS, federally-funded surveys find that significant numbers of younger persons between the ages
of 12 and 14 drank alcohol in the month before they were surveyed, and that more than 90 percent obtain
alcohol from their own home, the home of a friend, or an adult family member. Those findings clearly
indicate the importance that family members can play in reducing young adolescents’ access to alcohol and
the associated risks of injury and the early onset of serious health problems; and
WHEREAS, Middle school, high school and younger college and university students in Cook County are
at significant risk of serious illness, injury, and death if they engage in illegal underage drinking; and
WHEREAS, We Don’t Serve Teens provides parents and teens with useful information on the dangers of
underage drinking, the manner in which most teens procure alcohol, the costs of violating the law, and
strategies to overcome peer pressure and other negative influences; and
WHEREAS, We Don’t Serve Teens information is available at a web site established by the Federal Trade
Commission, www.dontserveteens.gov <http://www.dontserveteens.gov>, and the information will be
publicized by Cook Country-based Constellation Brands Beer Division in various media and at retailer
during the month of September; and
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, Cook County commends the Federal Trade Commission for
its efforts to protect our teens and the general public and endorses the basic message: Don’t serve alcohol
to teens; it’s unsafe, illegal, and irresponsible; and
BE IT FURTHUER RESOLVED, Resolved, that Cook County calls upon all licensed alcohol beverage
retailers to actively participate in We Don’t Serve Teens outreach efforts to their customers; and
BE IT FURTHUER RESOLVED, Cook County commends Constellation Brands Beer Division, Cook
County beer distributors, and Cook County alcohol beverage retailers for their ongoing support for We
Don’t Serve Teens; and
BE IT FURTHUER RESOLVED, the Cook County calls upon all parents, civic leaders, and other adults
involved in the lives of teens to post the We Don’t Serve Teens logo on their social network pages and to
