CITY COUNCIL QUARTERLY REPORT
Q1 FY 2020

 

 

October 15, 2019

The Honorable Brenda Jones, President

Detroit City Council

Coleman A. Young Municipal Activity Center, 13th Floor
Detroit, MI 48226

Subject: City Council Quarterly Report, Quarter FY 2020, Detroit Land Bank Authority
Dear Council President Jones:

I am pleased to submit this quarterly report on behalf ofthe Detroit Land Bank Authority
(DLBA). The strategic and layered approach to curbing residential blight continues
to improve neighborhoods across all seven Council districts. This quarter we hit a milestone
of 20,000 total sales across all programs. Combined with a total of 12,680 Hardest Hit Fund
(HHF) demolitions, the DLBA has advanced the City?s blight elimina?n?on goal by addressing
32,680 properties since 2014. We estimate the total economic impact of the 
Auction, Own It Now, and demolition programs is $427,818,872 to the City of Detroit.

Of course, our success relies on the hard work and dedication of the people who
purchase and renovate DLBA houses every day This quarter, 545 Auction and Own lt
Now buyersfinished their renovations and achieved Compliance. To date, 3,015 people
have successfully rehabilitated their Auction and Own lt Now homes.

We are proud that the majority of DLBA buyers are Detroiters. Our voluntary, post?sale
survey shows 69% of buyers lived in Detroit at the time of purchase, and 67% plan to
live in their DLBA home after renovation. Additionally, 61% of respondents indicate they
were renters before buying from the DLBA, demonstrating our unique ability to make the
dream of homeownership a reality for those systematically excluded from the traditional
real estate market.

This ?scal year our team focused on implementing creative solutions that address
the changing nature of the market and inventory. We pushed forward into
neighborhoods that have yet to benefit from outside investment and areas where DLBA
sales were not previously feasible. As a result, Own It Now sales out-paced Auction sales,
fueled in part by the strength of our community-based Building Blocks event strategy.
With an increasing caseload, we are actively realigning our Compliance team to improve
customer service and better support successful renovations.

.I 

Community engagement continues to play a critical role in the efforts to return
blighted and vacant properties to productive use. Our dedicated outreach team attended
more than 50 community meetings this quarter, while our Client Services staff served
3,512 walk?in customers and answered 20,855 phone calls.

The DLBA remains committed to improving the quality of life for all Detroiters by advancing
holistic blight remediation efforts in every city neighborhood.

DEPUTY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR
TAMMY DANIELS

 

The Deputy Executive Director supports the Executive Director in the development and implementation
of the Detroit Land Bank Authority?s (DLBA) strategic initiatives and policies. Promoted from Demolition
Director at the close of the ?scal year 2019, Tammy Daniels transitioned to Deputy Executive Director in
the ?rst quarter of the ?scal year 2020. The transition was the ?rst step in a reorganization, instrumental
to identifying critical areas for organizational growth and promoting best practices.

Under the new structure, the Deputy Executive Director oversees the following departments:
0 Demolition
- Compliance
0 Public Relations Strategic Initiatives

DEMOLITION

The DLBA, in partnership with the Mayor?s Of?ce, City Council, and the Detroit Building Authority (DBA),
continues to impact all Council districts through its various demolitTon programs. The DLBA gears its target
demolitions within the federally designated HHF geographic boundaries toward reducing blight and spurring
economic activity in these neighborhoods. The strategic demolition efforts are complemented by
strategic reinvestment and rehabilitation, leading to signi?cant increases in property values across the city.

HARDEST HIT FUNDS

Thefederal Hardest Hit Fund (HHF) program administered bythe DLBA is near completion, with all remaining
funds now under contract and fewer than 900 structures slated to be torn down with HHF dollars. To date,
MSHDA has reimbursed the DLBA $215,226,691.78 for 12,680 demoli?ons across all ?ve rounds of HHF.
Currently, the DLBA is awaiting in reimbursements for 2,748 properties.

As ofthe close of this reporting period, four rounds of HHF funding are currently open, as the DLBA
successfully closed out HHF3 on December 27, 2018.

Please see the Hardest Hit Fund Program tab of for a complete list of properties
demolished and released to contractors. The DLBA continues to work diligently with the demolition
contractors to ensure their invoices and supporting documents are correct, complete, and processed in
a timely manner.

ONGOING INVESTIGATIONS

MED
In February 2019, the Detroit Building Authority (DBA) the DLBA's HHF project manager received credible

information that McDonagh Demolition foundation walls, slabs, and other demolition debris buried at
multiple sites, in direct violation of their contractual obligations. The DLBA and DBA issued a Stop Work
Order immediately and launched an internal investigation requiring McDonagh to verify all sites were
properly excavated, debris removed, and backfilled. As ofthe date ofthis report, McDonagh has completed
all the work necessary to close out its contracts and is currently submitting invoices accordingly.

City of Detroit Of?ce of Inspector General: Third Partvr Air Monitoring Contractors

On August 9, 2019, the City of Detroit?s Of?ce of Inspector General (DIG) issued interim suspensions for
BBEK Environmental, Green Way, HC Consultants and principals representing all three companies, for
violations of MCL 338.3221 which requires air quality monitors be wholly independent and of abatement
contractors.

On September 20, 2019, the 016 issued an interim suspension for Environmental Specialty Services (ESS)
due to their alleged involvement in criminal activity related to the demolition program and the fact that
asbestos abatement impacts the health and safety of Detroit residents.

SIGTARP

On June 4, 2019, at the request of U.S. Representatives Brenda Lawrence and Rashida Talib, SIGTARP
initiated an evaluation to update its review of technical and other requirements for demolitions in the
HHF Blight Elimination Program in Michigan. SIGTARP, with the Army Corp of Engineers, will also evaluate
ongoing and completed demolition activities in Detroit, analyzing demolitions in relation to industry best
practices and safeguards to determine any program risks.

ADVANCE FUND

On March 31, 2015, through the approval of City Council, the $20 million Demolition Advance Fund
was created. The sole purpose of the DAF was to ensure the DLBA had suf?cient cash flow
to make payments to contractors providing services under the HHF program, while the DLBA awaits
reimbursement payments from IVISHDA. The DLBA in partnership with the Of?ce of the CFO has been
working to amend the Memorandum of Understanding with the City to ensure conformity with the City
Council?s Resolution that created the DAF. The amended agreement will be presented to City Council
upon completion.

As a result of the efforts, working in conjunction with and its City partners, more than
12,680 blighted structures were demolished with HHF money. The DLBA estimates demolition of an
additional 2,400 structures with the remaining HHF allocation. Removal of these blighted structures
from the City?s landscape stabilizes neighborhoods and motivates the real estate market, both of which
are crucial to the City?s resurgence

EPUTY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR

 

COMPLIANCE

This quarter, the Detroit Land Bank Authority transitioned its Compliance Team under the Deputy
Executive Director's oversight from the Legal Department. The move is part of a planned restructuring
of the Compliance Team, which will establish revised internal operations, client communications, and
requirements; improving DLBA-buyer experience and renovation success

 

The Compliance Team enforces agreements signed by property owners who have either purchased
a property from the DLBA (?Sales Compliance") or whose property was the subject of a Nuisance
Abatement Program action Compliance?). For both Sales and NAP Compliance, property owners
agree to rehabilitate the property within six (6) months and provide regular updates to the Compliance
Team documenting and verifying progress. If a property owner is not able to achieve compliance within
the initial timeframe but has shown acceptable ?proof of progress,? the Compliance Team provides 90-
day extensions. The Compliance team provides an automatic 90-day extension for properties located in
a historic district or properties purchased in the winter.

The Sales Compliance reporting period begins on the date of closing when the property owner takes

title to the property and obtains possession. At closing, the property owner simultaneously executes a
Reconveyance Deed the DLBA can record if the property owner fails to rehabilitate the property and

the obligations outlined in the purchase agreement. Achieving Sales Compliance involves an objective,
three-part criteria including:

1. Obtaining the appropriate inspection from the City of Detroit?s Buildings, Safety, Engineering, and
Environmental Department (BSEED)

2. Occupying the property

3. Exterior maintained no boards, no blight.

The NAP Compliance program works with property owners who have entered into an agreement to
avoid or stop litigation on properties identi?ed as vacant, blighted, and a nuisance. The agreement
outlines their responsibilities for rehabilitating or demolishing the property or selling it to someone who
will. If the property owner fails to provide ?proof of progress? on the subject property, the Compliance
Team transfers the matter to DLBA attorneys for court action. To achieve NAP Compliance owners must
demonstrate the property is no longer a nuisance to the residents and the neighborhoods evidenced by
occupancy and exterior maintenance no boards, no blight. After achieving NAP Compliance, the DLBA
releases its lis pendens and dismisses the lawsuit.

COMPLIANCE PROPERTIES ON THE DANGEROUS BUILDINGS LIST
In the ?scal year 2019, Compliance identi?ed hundreds of properties sold by the DLBA, which remained
on the city?s Dangerous Buildings List. The DLBA and Buildings, Safety, Engineering, and Environmental
Department collaborated to create a streamlined soluo'on for impacted clients and ultimately presented
a resolution to remove Orders to Demolish from all properties with which the DLBA holds
legal interest. The resolution was approved by City Council and the Mayor in July 2019; eliminating an
encumbrance to renovation faced by DLBA buyers

PUBLIC RELATIONS STRATEGIC INITIATIVES

At the close of the ?rst quarter, DLBA leadership promoted the Public Information Of?cer to the Role
of Assistant Director of Public Relations and Strategic Initiatives, reporting to the Deputy Executive
Director. The new role will emphasize continued DLBA brand management through proactive media
and communications strategy. Additional focus will also include a targeted effort to identify and remedy
intErnal and external roadblocks and develop process improvements across the organization. The DLBA
is actively seeking a City Council and Government Liaison, dedicated to responding to requests from
City Council and other government enti?des. The Liaison will report to the Assistant Director of Public
Relations and Strategic Initiatives and will be hired early in the second quarter of the fiscal year 2020.

INVENTORY
ROBERT LINN, DIRECTOR

 

The Detroit Land Bank Authority?s Inventory Department oversees the acquisition, assessment, and
pipeline assignments for all parcels in the inventory. The department also spearheads data
analysis and coordination with other City agencies and harnesses these roles to inform a sales strategy for
the organization. Housing these two functions together allows the department to implement a ?exible
strategy that is informed by on-the-ground sales trends and roll out strategic efforts rapidly.

In responsetothecontinued concentration ofthe department
staff increased efforts to re?ne the organization?s sales strategy. Building upon the momentum of Q4 FY
2019, staff emphasized three new efforts in Q1: the development of a more robust marketing program,
the addition of property condition reports with Own it Now sales, and an evolution of the organization?s
pre-sale maintenance program. Together, Inventory Department staff believe that the efforts will support
the organization?s efforts to responsibly return more properties to productive reuse, even in the face of
a shift to weaker markets.

Marketing Pipeline

To address the organization?s portfolio of multifamily properties, homes with extraordinary rehabilitation
needs, non?residential structures, and other atypical properties, staff launched an effort in C11 to increase
the number of properties listed through real estate brokers. As this growth matriculates through the sale
preparation pipeline, staff anticipate the flow of properties to brokers increasing three? or four-fold. As
the organization shifts emphasis to selling properties in lower-demand areas, staff sees this pipeline as
an expanded opportunity to sell properties in creative ways, such as homesteads or small-scale bundles,
that may increase buyer interest.

Property Scopes

In (11, work began in earnest to move toward providing property condition reports for Own It Now
listings. As the organization increases home sales in lower-demand markets, staff believe providing
additional information about properties will increase purchaser certainty and, ultimately, demand. Given
the scale of the Own It Now program, these program?specific property condition reports will catalogue
major deficiencies, list necessary building permits, and provide cost comparisons to past 
rehabs of similar homes. The I?wn It Now condition reports will launch in the second quarter.

Maintenance Program

The Inventory Department is researching ways to make the maintenance program more ef?cient
and productive, as the organization emphasizes the sale of properties with greater maintenance
requirements. DLBA leadership hired Jamie Furst as Assistant Director of Inventory in September; with a
priority on bringing further improvements to the maintenance program. The Props-rty Maintenance Team
is tasked with curating a robust network of specialized vendors, increasing collaboration with community
partners, and developing a business plan for creating an in-house maintenance ?eld crew.

PROPERTY EVALUATION AND PIPELINE MANAGEMENT

The Property Evaluation and Pipeline Management Division of the Inventory Department combines
property condition information, zoning, market data, neighborhood plans, and resrdent input to
determine the best strategy for returning DLBA-owned structures to productive use. The team evaluates
structures for sale or demolition, identifying home sale opportunities and overseeing the preparation
and listing of properties for sale.

I For a more thorough exploration of these issues, see the Inventory Department section of the C13
quarterly report.

Pg. 13

INVENTORY

The Property Evaluation and Pipeline Management team evaluates vacant DLBA-owned structures by
analyzing the properties through three primary lenses: condition, location, and public input. The following
graphic illustrates how the Property Evaluation and Pipeline Management team uses these three lenses
to assess houses for sale/rehab or demolition and identify which houses to prioritize for sale.

The Property Evaluation and Pipeline Management team also directs the selection and preparation of
properties for sale and re-use throu the BA's sale programs, including:

0 Auction: daily auction focuse on the sale of vacant houses in areas of relatively higher market

demand. Homes are cleaned out. Prospective buyers can view the homes in an open house. Esti-

mated rehab costs are provided online.

0 Own It Now: focused on the sale of vacant houses with the goal of stabilizin areas of softer ma r-
ket demand. Homes receive limited maintenance and are generally listed for 80 days or until offer
is received.

. Marketing: focused on the sale of a pical properties, including: vacant lots with the potential
for small-scale in?ll development or a ternative uses, the small inventory non?residential
structures {acquired from the state or county), multi-unit residential buildings, homes with ex?
traordinary rehabilitation needs, and strong home sales candidates that have failed to sell through
the Auction or Owth-Now programs. Pro erties are listed through real estate brokers. Buyers are
required to provide project plans, proof 0 capacity.

INVENTORY

DATA MANAGEMENT

The Data Management Division of the Inventory Department leads the data analysis, including
creating thematic maps, demographic and market analyses, and collaborating with City partners to share
necessary real estate data. Due to the requisite analytical approach, this division also oversees the
property vetting and listing process for Side Lot sales.

Census Data

At the end of 0.1, the U.S. Census Bureau released the 2018 American Community Survey (ACS) 1-year
estimates. Together, these data represent the latest reminders of the many profound, positive trends
in the city?s housing market presently underway. Census Bureau estimates suggest that the city is
home to an increasing number of households, an increasing homeownership rate, and increasing
market con?dence among residents. To land bank staff, these data at once illustrate the impact of the
organization's work and potential for further programmatic success. The land bank?s work .1 demolition,
sales of vacant properties, and rehabs all contribute to positive market improvement documented by
the Census Bureau, while the growing household ?gures suggest the city?s housing market IS continuing
along a positive trajectory, creating opportunity for future sales.

While the city?s population decline has slowed over the past five years, the number of households
has already begun to increase. Per U.S. Census Bureau data, 2018 marked the fourth year in a row of
household growth. During this period, the city added 12,843 households, increasing from 253,490 to
266,333, a 5.06% increase. These two seemingly con?icting trends are possible because, like the state
of Michigan and many cities across the country, the average household size has gradually decreased as
single residents and couples become more prevalent.

Similarly, the U.S. Census Bu reau?s 1-year estimates also document a similar reversal in homeownership.
trends Between 2014 and 2018, the city also added 7,466 owner-occu pied households, 58.13% ofthe
new households during this period.

The U.S. Census Bureau also surveys owner-occupants on their opinion of their home values. The
percentage of residents who believe their home is worth $50,000 or more has increased 24.67%, from
40.41% to 51.58%, suggesting both a strengthening market and a growing resident recognition ofthese
changes.

Side Lots

In the ?rst quarter, the Data Management team reviewed and responded to 589 side lot purchase inquiries
from the public. The team is also analyzing all DLBA-owned land for side lot eligibility in preparation for
a bulk listing of new side lots in November 2019. These new side lot listings are mainly comprised of
recently completed demolitions, lots with newly resolved tax delinquencies, and lots adjacent to newly
occupied homes.

Property Ownership Data Reconciliation

In Q1 2020, the Data Management team added a staff memberto complete the reconciliation of ownership
information between the DLBA's ownership records and the City of Detroit Of?ce of the Assessor?s
ownership records. In C11 2020, staff submitted Property Transfer Af?davit information for a total of
1,405 properties, and the Assessor?s of?ce updated 47% of these ownership information requests. The
remaining 52% of requests are still pending. This process is critical to the organization and its purchasers.
For the land bank, proper accounting of the organization?s inventory and sales ensures that properties
in the land bank?s inventory have salable title and that sales are properly recognized on the 5/50 tax roll.
For purchasers, this process is critical to a streamlined purchase process, ensuring that tax bills are sent
in a timely fashion and to the correct address.

NEIGHBORHOOD SERVICES

The Neighborhood Services division coordinates all department ?eld operations, including property
maintenance coordination with the General Services Department (GSD), preparation of proper?es for
sale, creating property condition reports for properties in the sales pipelines, and holistic neighborhood
preparation for open houses.

The Inventory Department strives to provide increasing levels of maintenance on the nearly 90,000
parcels. The team works closely with the City's General Services Department on regular property
maintenance, and in response to speci?c resident complaints such as overgrown lawns or strudures
open to trespass. The DLBA also contracts directly with vendors to prepare properties for sale, including
but not limited to debris removal, board-ups, lawn services, tarping roofs, and pumping out basements.

Pg. 19

INVENTORY

 

Between January 1, 2019, and September 30, 2019, the DLBA and GSD boarded 7,275 properb'es; 270
properties more than all of 2018. and Board?ups will continue through the end of the calendar year.
During the ?rst quarter of the ?scal year, the DLBA alone removed over 23,000 cubic yards of debris at
more than 1,300 properties, which is the equivalent of 657 standard-sized shipping containers. 650 also
removed debris at DLBA properties, but we currently do not track speci?c debris amounts. Therefore, the
actual amount of debris removed at DLBA properties across the city is even greater than 23,000 cubic
yards. The DLBA and GSD will continue to remove debris at DLBA structures and lots, both in preparation
for sale and in response to complaints.

STRATEGIC INITIATIVES

The Strategic Initiatives division continued to leverage relationships with other entities, both governmental
and non-governmental, to drive forward strategies. The team hosted five Building Block Events, with
thirteen more scheduled through June 2020. In addition to Building Blocks Events, the Strategic
Initiatives Team engages stakeholders across the city to foster new partnerships focused on increasing
homeownership and population density within Detroit neighborhoods.

Building Blocks Events

In August, the Strategic Initiatives team continued to build out processes and a webpage for Building
Blocks events. The team worked closely with the land bank?s Community Affairs Department to create
template materials for ?yers, postcards, and social media. The Administration and Operation Department
staff facilitated the build-out of a Building Blocks webpage this quarter, 
building-blocks/.

The team hosted two Building Blocks events in August and two in September. The ?rst event in the East
Can?eld community was part of the FCA Community Bene?ts Agreement. The three featured houses
had ?fty resulting in 12 purchase offers. The team also hosted Building Blocks Events in
Oakman Boulevard, Regent Park, and HubbelI-Lyndon. Early numbers suggest sales rates continue to
be higher on properties that are showcased in a Building Blocks event compared to other Own It Now
listings. The team works with the Community Affairs team to test new strategies for engagement
and marketing to maximize sales.

Additionally, the Strategic Initiatives Team continued to support the Bridging Neighborhoods Team on
their efforts to work with Del Ray residents. The Bridging Neighborhoods Program recently closed its 20th

more properties than the twenty completed. With a roughly 90% rejection rate, the DLBA continues to

DISPOSITION
REGINALD SCOTT, DIRECTOR

 

The Detroit Land Bank Authority?s (DLBA) core blight remediation effort is the disposition of property.
The Disposition Department facilitates structure and land sales through a wide range of programs. Most
of the DLBA's structure and land transactions are online, through the Auction, Own It Now, and Side Lot
platforms. The DLBA also sells property through the Rehabbed Ready, Occupied Programs, Projects
team, and, per the Memorandum of Understanding with the City of Detroit, the DLBA also engages in real
estate transactions in support of strategic City initiatives.

AUCTION

The DLBA auctions two houses per day on its website, buildingdetroit.org. Auction properties are the
strongest rehabilitation candidates, focused in areas with the best potential return on buyer
investment. The number of available Auction properties continues to decline as the DLBA exhausts its
strongest inventory and moves into neighborhoods awaiting investment with structures requiring more
extensive pre-sale work and renovation. As a result, in June 2019, the DLBA moved from auctioning four
homes a day to two, while simultaneously bolstering structure sales in other disposition programs.

Own It Now responds to public requests for properties in emerging neighborhoods. Any person can
contact the DLBA with an address, and with certain exceptions, we will list the property for sale. Once
a property is listed online, offers are accepted 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The ?rst offer on a
property triggers a 72-hour countdown, the person with the highest offer at the close ofthat timeframe
wins the property.

SKILLED TRADES EMPLOYMENT PROGRAM DISCOUNT POLICY

This quarter, the Detroit Land Bank Authority Board of Directors approved a new Auction discount for
skilled trades workers. The Skilled Trade Employment Discount Program (STEP) offers 50% of?fthe winning
bid price of a DLBA Auction property. The goal is to increase access to homeownership and incentivize
Detroit residents with critical construction industry skills to purchase and renovate homes within the city.
To be eligible, buyers must be active members in good standing with a local trade union that participates
in the City of Detroit?s Skilled Trade Employment Program. Modeled after the existing City of
Detroit Employee and School Employee discounts, STEP buyers must retain ownership of the property
for three-years or pay. a percentage of sale pro?ts to the DLBA. The City of Detroit?s Department of Civil
Rights, Inclusion, and Opportunity will verify membership in a STEP union local; interested participants
need to apply for the discount when they create an account on buildingdetroitorg before biddings.

Rehabbed Ready is a philanthropic initiative to improve residential market values and bolster
homeownership in the City of Detroit. Through collaboration with Quicken Loans, dilapidated DLBA
houses undergo full rehabilitation to at or above-market conditions. As a neighborhood-based initiative,
there are parallel efforts in place to reduce blight and encourage occupancy via the existing
demolition, nuisance abatement programs, and other Disposition programs in the Rehabbed 8: Ready
selected neighborhoods.

0 Closings. The total sold through is now 64, with new homeowners moving into

The Community Partnership Team and the Economic Development Team is now the ?Projects Team.?
Developers and Community Partners follow the same process for property acquisi?o?on, with Community
Partners receiving a 20% discount otfthe purchase prices. Potential buyers interested in acquiring property
through the Projects Team may do so through the online application process or the marketing tract.

Development Update

370 Grand Boulevard is completely remodeled and is currently for sale. In 2017, the DLBA marketed
these properties for about a year with very little interest. In earlyr 2018, interest picked up, and the
DLBA set a deadline for highest and best otters due on April 13th, 2018. The projects team received
seven offers and vetted the applicants internally and with our partners at the city of Detroit. Developer
Joe Ventimiglia?s St. Paul on the Boulevard plan was the unanimous pick. In addition, the developer
made signi?cant improvements to the interior and exterior of one privately-owned unit, at no cost to
that resident. Mr. Ventimiglia also recruited, trained, and employed people from the neighborhood to
complete construction.

OCCUPIED PROGRAMS

Occupied Programs further the mission of the DLBA, with an emphasis on providing a path to
homeownership for people living in DLBA-owned properties, and returning properties to the tax roll. The
Disposition Department?s tiered approach includes its ?agship Buy Back Program, Occupied Non?Profit
Pr0gram, and the Occupied Sales Program which is now in its-?nal planning stages.

Buy Back

The Buy Back Program provides a path forward for occupants of DLBA-owned houses. It allows an eligible
occupant the opportunity to gain ownership of the house in which they live. After qualifying for the
program and purchasing the property, the occupant of?cially enters Buy Back and must display consistent
savings until their next tax bill arrives.

in July. The change covers all properties in the inventory as well as sold properties with which
the land bank maintains legal interest; approximately 2,700 properties at the time of approval. Clearing
ODMs reduces the burden on buyers, clearing an additional roadblock to blight removal.

LEGAL
TIM DEVINE, GENERAL COUNSEL

 

The Legal Department is responsible for the legal affairs of the Detroit Land Bank Authority (DLBA).
The Legal Department provides legal advice and support to the DLBA to facilitate property disposition,
remediate nuisances, and address illegal activity at properties throughout Detroit, assisting the Land Bank
to achieve its goal of restoring blighted and vacant properties to productive use. The Legal Department
also represents the DLBA in a variety of legal, regulatory, transactional, and other contexts.

QUIET TITLE

The Legal Department ?les and oversees expedited Quiet Title Actions pursuant to authority under
Section 9 of the Land Bank Fast Track Act, MCL 124.759. On September 2, 2014, the Chief Judge of
the Wayne County Circuit Court issued a special docket directive creating a special docket allowing the
Detroit Land Bank Authority to ?le these actions ef?ciently. The DLBA ?les quiet title actions on its
properties, enabling the DLBA to sell those properties with clear, insurable title. Clear, insurable title is
very important for anyone buying property?not just from the DLBA, but in general. Clear title provides
the property owner con?dence in their ownership and any investmentthey make. It is also a requirement
for a lending institution considering ?nancing a mortgage. As of September 30, 2019, this last quarter,
the Legal Department obtained four hundred and forty-two (442) quiet title judgments.

NUISANCE ABATEMENT

ABANDONED PROPERTIES

The DLBA established its Nuisance Abatement Program (NAP) in February 2014. The Detroit City Council
delegated non-exclusive authority to commence Nuisance Abatement litigation on February 18, 2014
{Council Action Number 23). Properties meeting the NAP criteria are vacant and unoccupied, boarded,
open to trespass, appear to be abandoned or neglected.

The DLBA initially identi?es NAP property addresses using several sources, then locations are verified
by investigators, community groups, or neighbors in targeted geographic areas. The City of Detroit
Department of Neighborhoods de?ned the NAP Target Areas with input from members ofthe community.
To determine specific boundaries, the DLBA used data sources to specify areas where NAP actions would
be most effective: areas with relatively low levels of vacancy where a limited number of NAP lawsuits
could make a signi?cant difference to an otherwise stable block.

Service of Process is achieved as to all current owners. The DLBA searches tax, title, and other records for
each property to determine current interest holders of record, including owners, mortgage companies,
and other liens. The NAP civil suit names current owners of record and requests abatement of the
'nuisance' created by the property's condition. Owners or interest holders in properties who fail to
respond to the lawsuit may lose their ownership rights to the property at a hearing for defaultjudgment.

During the most recent quarter, as of September 30, 2019, the Legal Department identi?ed and placed
notices (?posters") on 179 and ?led suit against 81 properties in 29 different neighborhoods throughout
the City. These actions will result in agreements to address the blight or in judgments awarding ownership
of the properties to the DLBA to facilitate blight resolution thrOugh its various programs.

Pg. 39

LEGAL

This quarter, there were 84 agreements with property owners to rehabilitate their properties.
Additionally, the NAP program obtained 13 default judgments, two donations of abandoned property
to the DLBA instead of litigation, and six properties purchased from defendant property owners in cost?
saving settlements.

NAP lawsuits are an important tool in ful?lling the mission of stabilizing neighborhoods by
addressing blighted and abandoned property.

DRUG HOUSE UNIT

The Drug House Unit (DHU) is a facet of the Nuisance Abatement Program (NAP) and represents DPD
and joint goal of stabilizing neighborhoods by addressing the use of properties within the City.
of Detroit for the furtherance of drug trafficking. To identify these properties, the DHU receives weekly
emails from the Detroit Police Department (DPD) reporting properties where officers find drugs and drug
paraphernalia during surveillance and raids. The DHU reviews DPD data and determines next steps based
on the ownership of the property. If a property is privately-owned, and more than two raids occur within
a one (1) year period, the DHU may proceed with a lawsuit. If a property is DLBA-owned, the legal team
determines how to address occupancy at the property based on its internal inveso'gation into the exact
nature of the activities at the structure.

In the first quarter, the DHU received notice of 42 raids conducted by DPD. Of these raids, ten were
found to be on DLBA-owned properties, and 32 were found to be on owned properties and,
therefore, eligible for DHU action. The DHU sent warning letters to 27 of these eligible properties and
moved forward with the process of initiating five lawsuits. One consent judgment was executed with
a named Defendant to address the drug trafficking that has occurred at the property; there were no
default judgments. Of the ten raids on DLBA-owned properties, there were seven unique addresses
impacted. Of those seven addresses, four investigations are in progress. The legal department referred
two cases to DPD for the removal of the occupants. Investigators determined one property was vacant,
and the structure is now in the sales pipeline.

REMOVALS

The Legal Department is responsible for the removal of unauthorized occupants from DLBA- owned
properties. Due to the impact removals have on occupants, every removal is reviewed individually and
with a high level of scrutiny. The DLBA reviews every occupant for potential Buy Back Program eligibility
?rst; ifthe occupant is found to meet none ofthe initial Buy Back Program entry points or has been vetted
and found ineligible for the Buy Back Program, the legal team may go forward with removal. Buy Back
vetting will not occur if the DLBA finds there to be extenuating circumstances such as con?rmed reports
of illegal activity at the property or con?rmed vacancy and third-party sale. If the DLBA deems a property
un?t for habitation, the land bank will connect the occupant to the Detroit Health Department (DHD)
to assist with relocation while initiating removal proceedings. The ?nal step in a removal proceeding is
to secure the property and return it to the Inventory Department pipeline for assessment and potential
sale.

in the ?rst quarter, the DLBA initiated removal proceedings at 23 properties and completed removal
proceedings at 13 proper?es.

FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA) REQUESTS

Underthe Michigan Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), MCL 15.231 et seq., all persons, exceptthose who
are incarcerated, can submit a FOIA request to the Detroit Land Bank Authority (DLBA) FOIA Coordinator.
in the ?rst quarter, the DLBA received 13 new FOIA requests and completed 11 requests, all within
the statutory timeframes.

Honorable City Council:

The Housing Revitalization Department (HRD) hereby requests to amend the CDBG Annual Action Plans for
the ?scal years noted below. The funds targeted for reprogramming consist of unused funds, balances from

RE: Reprogramming Amendment to the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Annual
Action Plan for Fiscal Year 2016-2017

Honorable City Council:

The Housing and Revitalization Department (HRD) hereby requests to amend its HUD Consolidated Plan
Annual Action Plan for ?scal year 2016-17, to reprogram unused Community Development Block Grant
(CDBG) funds from the account below to be used in FY 2019-2020. The funds targeted for
reprogramming consist of unused funds, balances for programs that no longer exist, or are funds unlikely
to be used in a timely manner. If these funds are not expended, the City?s federal grant allocations will be
at risk of recapture by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Funds will be
allocated for activities that will allow for timely expenditures. A summary of the proposed changes

are as follows:

Line Items to be Reprogrammed (decrease):
- Focus Hope (FY 2016-17) $16,000.00

Line Items to be Reprogrammed (increase):
- Wayne County Neighborhood Legal Service (FY 2019-20) $16,000.00

We respectfully request that your Honorable Body approve the attached resolution authorizing this
amendment to the HUD Consolidated Plan Annual Action Plan for ?scal year 2016-17 for the stated

purpose.
