Legislative Updates – Tobacco 21 (T21)
On Monday, July 23rd Roger Sikes, Tom O’Donnell, Rick Novickis, Nichelle Shaw and Terry Allan
attended a hearing of the Euclid City Council Health Committee on Tobacco 21 (T21). Also in
attendance was Wendy Hyde of the Tobacco 21 Foundation. CCBH has been working for several
months with the City of Euclid to build legislation that would create an education and enforcement
structure to support their current T21 ordinance, which is general in nature.
T21 raises the age to purchase tobacco products, including little cigars and e cigarettes, to 21. Only
2% of tobacco sales are to children aged 18 to 20, but they drive 90% of the addiction to tobacco, as
they share products with their peers and only 5% of people start smoking after age 21. The following
points, provided by Roger Sikes, explain the risks (roger can share these).
T21 is sweeping the country and the state. To date, over 26 states have passed some form of T21
legislation, including approximately 10 Ohio cities, with Cleveland and Akron also passing legislation.
Key to an effective T21 program is education and enforcement. Nichelle Shaw reported that tobacco

compliance checks that assure vendors don’t sell to underage buyers reduced underage sales by
vendors from 21% to 8% in three years. CCBH is working with the City of Euclid to develop
legislation that would give CCBH the authority to permit tobacco vendors and enforce the Euclid law.
The legislation is based on similar language from other Ohio cities. The hearing was well received by
the City of Euclid and we anticipate that the amended bill that includes language authorizing CCBH to
serve in this role will go before Euclid City Council for approval in August. We are also aware that
other cities, including Cleveland Heights, are considering similar legislation
Board member Dr. Sherrie Williams noted that, as a pulmonologist, she understands the impact of
tobacco and fully supports T21. Dr. Williams asked if hookah bars would be exempt and CCBH staff
indicated that hookah bars would not be exempted. CCBH staff will keep the Board appraised on these
developments and would bring a resolution to the Board for consideration that would ratify any
authority extended to CCBH by the City of Euclid for Tobacco 21.
