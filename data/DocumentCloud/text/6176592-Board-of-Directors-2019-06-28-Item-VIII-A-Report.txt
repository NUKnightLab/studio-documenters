COMMITTEE ON CONTRACT COMPLIANCE

OFFICE OF CONTRACT COMPLIANCE

 MISSION

The mission of the Office of Contract Compliance (OCC) is to ensure the full and equitable participation of
minority, women and veteran-owned businesses (MBE/WBE/VBE) in the procurement process as both prime and
sub-contractors for Cook County Government and Cook County Health and Hospitals Systems (CCH). The
OCC seeks greater inclusion of MBE,WBE and VBEs on County and CCH contracts by conducting outreach
activities to the business community about the County’s Program.

 HISTORY OF M/WBE PROGRAM

 First enacted in 1988, the M/WBE Program was designed to remediate past County discrimination against

minorities and women on construction contracts.
 The Program evolved over time to apply also to goods and services contracts, as well as professional services

contracts; ultimately being extended to health and hospital contracts.
 In 2000, the construction portion of the Program was ruled unconstitutional, and Cook County was without

M/WBE participation on construction contracts for several years.
 Under the leadership of President Preckwinkle, the Program now is on firm constitutional footing supported

by Cook County’s first ever Disparity Study in 2013.

3

 CONSTITUTIONALLY DEFENSIBLE PROGRAM
 The Program is subject to Strict Scrutiny, the most exacting form of judicial

review, which requires that Cook County establish 1) that the County
participated in discrimination against minorities and women; and 2) that its
program to remedy those past wrongs is narrowly tailored to accomplish its
remedial purpose.
 The Program follows the format of the federal DBE program which includes caps

on personal net worth and adherence to the SBA size standards.
 The Program is supported by a Disparity Study and includes a sunset date to

ensure continuous econometric analysis to justify the Program’s maintenance

4

 NARROWLY TAILORED PROGRAM
 Goals are set on a contract-by-contract basis, no blanket goals or quotas
 Size of the contract, term of the contract, amount of subcontracting opportunity, availability

of M/WBEs to provide a commercially useful function on the contract

 Waiver Review Process when Good Faith Efforts to achieve the goals are

demonstrated
 Race and Gender-Neutral Measures to remedy past discrimination
 Prompt Payment Provision in Cook County Ordinance
 Outreach Program (OCC, Supply Chain Management and User Departments partnering with

Commissioners,Assist Agencies and other units of government)
 Anti-Discrimination Enforcement (Cook County Commission on Human Rights, OIIG, OCC)
 Unbundling large contracts (OCC, Supply Chain Management and User Departments)
 Holding pre-bid conferences (Supply Chain Management)
 Providing timely information on contracting opportunities and establishing schedules for

submitting bids with adequate time (OCC and Supply Chain Management)
