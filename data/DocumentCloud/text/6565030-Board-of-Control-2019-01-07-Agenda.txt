and what was the cost of prior study. Ms. Baker also asked if the data from prior studies may be built
upon to complete this next study; and asked for clarification on the total amount as the cost appears to
be excessive given that the prior study is being updated. Lenora Lockett clarified that the time period of
vendor services will be for 1 year and that the data being evaluated will cover a 5-year period, as required
by County Code and stated that the running cost of a disparity study of this type can average $300,000.00
- $400,000.00. Ms. Baker asked if the amount requested will be the approximate anticipated cost for
future disparity studies; Ms. Lockett stated that unless there are judicial changes, any recommended
changes resulting from the study, based on racial or gender inclusion programs that may be implemented,
must be based on current data and not stale data, which is defined as data that is 5 years or older. Ms.

to update rather than starting the study from the beginning. Ms. Lockett said that the experts will
determine what the current requirements will be at that time; stated that the data studied is based on
fixed time periods and that implemented program changes need to be re-evaluated with the next study
to see if they are still necessary.
Ms. Baker also asked if prior work from Griffin & Strong was satisfactory. Dale Miller commented that
similar studies in other jurisdictions have run approximately $750,000.00 - $1,000,000.00 and believes
that the requested amount is a good value; stated that not-withstanding technical problems of data
collection, that overall Griffin & Strong provided a fine work product that has provided the ability to
construct inclusion programs based on substantive data, which aided to properly set data-based diversity
goals for County contracts; said there have been no legal challenges to our programs which further
evidences success and that the next study will show where we have progressed and areas that need
improvement. Joseph Nanni asked how often the County is required to conduct a disparity study. Nan
Baker asked for clarification on when the next study will be conducted. Lenora Lockett indicated that she
will be recusing from voting on this item. Armond Budish motioned to approve the item; Dale Miller

Kathleen Johnson, Family and Children First Council, presented. Lenora Lockett clarified Ms. Johnson’s
presentation to indicate these types of requests will be paid on department orders not requiring

consistent with the recent Internal Audit Report. Ms. Lockett provided additional detail on the vendor
selection process by the family utilizing services with payments from State funds occurring later. Ms.
Lockett stated that approval of this request provides for encumbrance of department orders in a total

in the past. Dennis Kennedy concurred with Ms. Lockett’s assessment and stated that the Fiscal Office,

This is for the purchase of a Fastcase Inc. online legal research database of e-books and other legal
research materials. The Law Library is only open regular business hours, but members need to conduct
legal research at other times of the day. They also often prefer to conduct their research from their
homes or offices. It will provide a means by which members can access legal research books and other
legal resources online, 24x7 even when the Law Library is closed.
This product is available for 24x7 access, is affordable, and provides a good search engine for retrieving
relevant search results. It also offers good exporting options for legal research results. The Librarian
considered the Ohio State Bar Association's Casemaker product, but it is not available with 24x7 access
for members. It must be used onsite at the Law Library. Onsite at the Law Library or 24x7 access at
members' offices and homes.
An RFP exemption is being requested as the Law Library has a perpetual exemption from competitive
procurement for the purchase of books and literature. I have used the process, and it has a good search
engine with good exporting options for research results; it is reasonable in price; and it is available 24x7
to members.

Implementing a central data repository will allow all users of the system to enter, track, and remove active
protection orders. The system will be available to all law enforcement partners throughout the county as
well as communicate directly with the state where original protection orders must be filed. Utilizing one
location to enter and store this information will not only increase the knowledge of the law enforcement
partners but also avoid instances where inactive or expired protection orders are still believed to be in
effect. The ultimate goal is timely, consistent enforcement of all orders of protection.

Describe the exact services being provided. The services that are being provided by Guardian Alarm are
monitoring services within the County Buildings. The anticipated start-completion dates are 01/01/2019
- 12/31/2019.
The primary goals of the project are to provide Monitoring Services for Cuyahoga County Buildings.
Procurement
The procurement method for this project was RFP Exemption. The total value of the RFP Exemption is
$6,000.00.
An RFP Exemption is being requested as monitoring services from Guardian alarm Company (Guardian)
have been utilized for many years by Cuyahoga County. Due to the services and equipment already
being utilized and installed within the County Buildings, an Exemption was required in order to enter
into a contract with Guardian. The equipment is installed within the buildings and the original method
of payment was to voucher invoices quarterly. Due to the changes within our Auditors Department we
are required to enter into a contract with Guardian in order to ensure that payments can be processed
for the monitoring services.

Department of Public Works; 2018; Amend Alternate Procurement to Add Additional Vendors Ready Mix
Concrete Vendors
Scope of Work Summary
The Department of Public Works is requesting to add two (2) vendors to the approved alternate
procurement, BD2018-142. The vendors to add are Cuyahoga Concrete Co. and Campbell Concrete &
Supply. This will not change the total dollar amount of the previously approved item.
The reason for adding these vendors is due to the fact that three (3) vendors (Osborne, Rockport and Carr
Bros.) will not be able to supply concrete as needed therefore these vendors are necessary to obtain
deliveries when the other companies cannot. This will insure that work is completed in a timely matter
and staff do not have to wait around for concrete to be delivered. The vendors will be awarded not-toexceed department orders on an as needed basis.
Procurement
The procurement method for this project was originally an informal bid and the not-to-exceed amount of
the alternate procurement is $320,000.00 for a two-year period.

Department of Sustainability,
In 2016, the Cleveland-Cuyahoga Bikeshare program launched with money the County was awarded
through NOACA's TLCI 2015 grant program. Both the City of Cleveland and BikeCleveland, a bicycle
advocacy non-profit, were key partners in launching the program. BikeCleveland had originally
approached the County to apply for the grant since it can only be awarded to governmental agencies. In
2017, the County, with the assistance of BikeCleveland and the City of Cleveland, again, applied for a
second round of funding to expand the current bikeshare system. We were awarded $284,200 with
$306,800 in local match.
For the first bikeshare round, we gave BikeCleveland the authority to run the RFQ/RFP process to select a
bikeshare provider/operator. BikeCleveland was best qualified to run the RFQ/RFP process since they
were the organization that completed the initial bikeshare feasibility study, and initially proposed the idea
of using NOACA’s TLCI funds to launch it. For this second round, we are also requesting authority for
BikeCleveland to act as a consultant to the County and run the RFP process.
