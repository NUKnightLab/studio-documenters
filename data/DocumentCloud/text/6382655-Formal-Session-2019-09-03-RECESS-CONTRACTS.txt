Financially Empowering Young Detroit Workers - CFE Fund and City of Detroit Capability Statement

- Please provide a brief overview of your proposed work, including the goo! and objectives.

The CFE Fund. the City of Detroit Department of Neighborhoods, and the Detroit Employment Solutions
Corporation propose to partner to expand the Integration of financial empowerment and
banking access strategies into year-round employment programs, supporting and building a broader
?nancial empowerment infrastructure in the City of Detroit.

Currently. the CFE Fund is working with the City of Detroit to integrate banking access and targeted
?nancial education in Grow Detroit's Young Talent IGDYT). This effort ls part of the CFE Fund's larger
Summer Jobs Connect (Sit) initiative, at Iii-city program that embeds safe banking access into SYEPs to
connect young workers to safe bank or credit union accounts and targeted ?nancial education, building
long-term positive ?nancial behaviors and skills. DESC received a CFE Fund planning award to think
through programmatic touchpoints for ?nancial empowerment integrations. and has been working to
implement these integrations into GDYT. The goal is for a majority of the 8,000 (3an youth employees
to have the opportunity to open a safe bank or credit union account through this initial planning grant.

Skillman Foundation funding would allow the CFE Fund and the City of Detroit to expand this work to
two additional programs, providing an additional 1,300 youth with banking access and financial
education opportunities. These additional resources would allow the CF Fund to provide technical
assistance throughout the year, fully integrating banking access and targeted financial education Into
the Workforce innovation and Opportunity Act Year Round Youth and Jobs For Michigan
Graduates llMG) programs. Technical assistance efforts would focus on banking and program design.
CFE Fund banking technical assistance would support the Department of Neighborhoods to negotiate
with local banks and credit unions to offer accounts that meet the CFE Fund's MW.
and assist in the selection of a safe, low-fee paycard option as an alternative to direct deposit. In
providing technical assistance around programmatic design, the CFE Fund would work with staff from
each youth program to identify opportunities to integrate and design education around the benefits of
banking. opening of safe and affordable accounts, and opportunities to enroll in direct deposit to accept
wages and stipends. Outcomes achieved would Include the number of safe and affordable accounts
available to youth in Detroit, the number of youth learning the bene?ts of banking. number of accounts
opened, and number of youth receiving income by direct deposit.

0 Describe the youth who will bene?t from this miloborotion and their needs and/or issues.

Detroit?s youth employment challenges are severe. Over 42% of people ages 16-24 are unemployed, the
highest of any age group.1 in the face of these challenges. employing youth is a fundamental step in

moving toward a stronger ?nancial future - especially as they begin earning money and making
decisions with ?nancial implications. Preparing for ?nancial considerations is not often part of youth
programing- but the CFE Fund and DESC propose to add these important topics into year-round
employment.

0 Which domainis) (Achieve-Connect-Thrive} does the proposed program address? And how?

Programming delivered as part of positive youth development efforts can help young people learn and
develop critical skills. However. preparing young people for the ?nancial considerations of adulthood,
and teaching young people about the financial marketplace within which they are already interacting,
are unfortunately not often core components of youth programing. Yet nearly all experts agree that
such efforts should start early in children's lives.

in addition to contributing to positive youth development overall, building ?nancial empowerment
strategies into youth programming can also contribute more speci?cally to financial well-being.
Research shows that ?nancial knowledge and skills are particularly Important pans of a positive youth
pathway?some research has even suggested that providing young people with opportunities to
develop ?nancial skills and to save might impact other aspects of their development, such as college
enrollment and graduation rates. Financial empowerment tools can enable young people to feel more
confident and Independent as they enter adulthood, and strengthen their ability to accomplish personal
goals.

This proposed initiative ls built off the work that the CFE Fund has been doing with the City of Detroit
through its Summer iohs Connect Initiative, which has been integrating banking access into municipal
summer youth employment programs over the past ?ve years. The CFE Fund conducted a series of focus-
groups with Summeriobs Connect participants in 2015 to understand how youth perceived the
connection between their own developmental objectives and SlC's ?nancial empowerment efforts, as
well as If or: supported their development. The focus groups found that youth had optimistic. future-
oriented goals: that they linked financial capability to achieving their goals, from education to career and
quality of life goals: and that ?nancial empowerment built con?dence. competence and skills, and
connection and agency. Youth who participated In SYEP not only developed skills and habits for using
and evaluating financial services, but reported feeling competent using their skills. They said they had
gained confidence as a result of their access to ?nancial institution information, opening a credit union
or bank account, and savings activities, and expressed con?dence in their ability to build savings.

Expanding the ?nancial empowerment strategies of Summer Jobs Connect into year-round youth
employment programming will help young people build confidence and take ownership over their
actions. They will see how their abilities to interact with the financial mainstream can grow through
financial empowerment supports: they will have con?dence in their ability to open a bank account.
enroll In direct deposit, and save for their futures; and they will be able to take ownership over having a
strong ?nancial future.

saving for the future. By connecting youth with bank accounts just as they begin to earn income, this
approach aims to help them embark on a path to long-term ?nancial stability and security.

This initiative will help young people access safe and affordable banking products, building their
relationships with mainstream ?nancial institutions and overall positivity toward banking. This will
prepare them to connect to new employment opportunities and make significant contributions to the
City of Detroit's recovery.

- How are you trucking youth attendance, impact, and program quality?

DESC utilizes the state?s One Stop Management information System (OSMIS) as well as the G'Stars
system. In addition, JMG utilizes its own proprietary database to track students.

DESC uses program monitors to ensure the quality of its programs. The JMG program Is also evaluated
by state JMG monitors for program compliance.

Finally, as part of all grant initiatives, the CFE Fund emphasizes the importance of data collection and
understanding program impact-

Re: Neighborhood Advisory Council Letter of Support for the FCA US LLC Community
Bene?ts PrOposal

Mr. Cox.

FCA US LLC plans to expand its existing operations at the Jefferson North and Mack Avenue
Assembly Plants. Proposed expansions will include buildings for general assembly. a paint
shop. a body shop. a test track facility. and a quality center. This development will provide an
opportunity for FCA US LLC and its partners to employ approximately 4,950 people.

To identify the impacts of this project. the FCA US LLC Neighborhood Advisory Council (the
NAC) was established on Wednesday. March 20. 2019 for the purpose of participating in the
Community Bene?ts Process. as required by the Detroit Community Bene?ts Ordinance.

As part of the community benefits process. the NAC met with FCA. City staff. and members of
the public to better understand FCA US LLC proposed investment and to provide a list of
concerns to the development team. After a series of nine meetings. all three parties agreed
upon a list of impacts; this list. responses and map of the planning area are included here as an
attachment.

The NAC actively engaged the public throughout this process to solicit community feedback via
community meetings. informal surveys. and conversations with neighbors. The purpose of this
engagement was to develop an informed Community Benefits Agreement (CBA) that best
represents our understanding of community needs and reflects what was heard as an outcome
of the strong community engagement. As a result. the FCA US LLC NAC provided a six page
list of impacts to FCA US LLC and the City of Detroit staff that included most of this community
input.

During discussions with the NAC members. the City of Detroit and FCA US LLC committed to
the items included in the attached Developer City Commitment List.

After reviewing the proposal and public comment. the NAC voted 8-1 to support FCA US LLC
Community Benefits Proposal. Further, the NAC supports this package with the commitment of
FCA US LLC to continue engagement with the NAC. residents of the impact area. and the
broader commUnity for as long as the company is in the neighborhood. even though the formal
community benefits process has come to an end.

The NAC is pleased to offer this letter of support the attached US Responses to
Impacts as identified by FCA US LLC NAC - April 24 2019" document accurately re?ects our
understanding of the agreed upon community benefits to be included in the development
agreement for this project.

The NAC welcomes FCA US LLC to the neighborhood and looks forward to working with
members of the City's administration and the FCA US LLC team in the near and distant future
to create a stronger community for all.
