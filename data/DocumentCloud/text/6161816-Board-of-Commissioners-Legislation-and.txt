PROPOSED RESOLUTION
URGING THE ILLINOIS GENERAL ASSEMBLY TO PASS HB 172 TO RESTORE JUDICIAL
DISCRETION IN THE TRANSFER OF JUVENILES TO ADULT COURT
WHEREAS, the nation’s first juvenile court was created in Cook County 115 years ago, based on the
understanding that children are different and should be treated differently than adults; and
WHEREAS, scientific research has proven that the adolescent brain is not fully developed in the areas that
regulate rational decision making and impulse control; and

Page 5 of 10

 WHEREAS, 705 ILCS 405/5-130 of the Juvenile Court Act, mandates that youth predominantly 15 and older,
but as young as 13, automatically be tried as adults, in adult court, facing adult sentences, based solely on the
charge brought, which is at the exclusive discretion of the prosecutor; and
WHEREAS, Illinois is one of only 14 states that do not require a hearing in front of a juvenile court judge before
a child is transferred to adult court; and
WHEREAS, according to a study by the Illinois Juvenile Justice Initiative (JJI), since the passage of the
Automatic Transfer statute in 1982, transfers to adult court have increased from 57 annually to 86 annually as of
2012; and
WHEREAS, the number of youth charged as Automatic Transfers increased dramatically after the passage of
“Raise the Age” legislation from 96 in 2013 to 178 in 2014; and
WHEREAS, Automatic Transfer of youth to adult court has a direct impact on the Cook County Juvenile
Temporary Detention Center (JTDC) in which the average daily population of transferred youth has nearly
doubled over the last year from 72 to 138; and
WHEREAS, according to the JJI study, the implementation of Automatic Transfer has resulted in more children
being transferred to adult court for less serious crimes as compared to when judges made the transfer decisions;
and
WHEREAS, Automatic Transfer has an extreme disproportionate impact on children of color. In a three year
sample of automatic transfers in Cook County, only 83% of youth transferred were African American, and only
one youth was white; and
WHEREAS, approximately 54% of Automatic Transfer youth in the three year study by JJI ultimately pled
guilty to lesser charges that if originally charged would have been prosecuted in juvenile court; and
WHEREAS, Adult court cases are processed at a much slower pace than juvenile cases with an average time to
disposition of 369 days for Automatic Transfer youth whose cases where disposed of in the last year; and
WHEREAS, according to a 2007 survey by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention children
prosecuted as adults are 34% more likely to reoffend than children with similar criminal histories who are
prosecuted in juvenile court for similar offenses; and
WHEREAS, “The Consequences of Transfer” a study published by the University of Chicago Press, found that
children prosecuted as adults are more likely to commit more serious new crimes at a faster rate than those tried in
juvenile court; and
WHEREAS, according to analysis by the John Jay College of Criminal Justice there is no correlation between
the transferring of juveniles to adult court and the drop in youth violence across the country; and
WHEREAS, the United Nation Human Rights Committee urged the U.S. to end prosecution of juveniles in adult
court; and
WHEREAS, the Supreme Court of Illinois in People v. Patterson, urged the legislature to reform the automatic
transfer statute in Illinois stating “While modern research has recognized the effect that the unique qualities and
characteristics of youth may have on juveniles’ judgment and actions, the automatic transfer provision does not.
Indeed, the mandatory nature of that statute denies this reality. Accordingly, we strongly urge the General
Assembly to review the automatic transfer provision based on the current scientific and sociological evidence
indicating a need for the exercise of judicial discretion in determining the appropriate setting for the proceedings
in these juvenile cases”; and

Page 6 of 10

 WHEREAS, automatic transfer prevents any consideration by a judge of the particular characteristics of a child,
the crime, or the child’s role in the crime in determining the appropriate venue for sentencing; and
WHEREAS, automatically transferring youth accused of certain crimes ignores the scientific research and the
underlying philosophy of the juvenile court; and
WHEREAS, Every child in Illinois deserves a fair hearing in front of a juvenile court judge to determine whether
their case is more appropriately handled in juvenile or adult court; and
WHEREAS, it is in the best interest of justice to restore judicial discretion in all decisions relating to the transfer
of a child to adult court;
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners does hereby urge
the Illinois General Assembly to pass HB 172, which ends the Automatic Transfer of youth to adult court and
restores judicial discretion, by requiring a hearing in front of a juvenile court judge to determine whether a child is
suitable for the rehabilitative focus of the juvenile court or should be transferred to adult court and sentenced as an
adult; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a suitable copy of the Resolution be tendered to the Speaker of the Illinois
House of Representatives and the President of the Illinois Senate.

the original charge (“Automatic Transfer”); and
WHEREAS, the Illinois General Assembly enacted Automatic Transfer in 1982 in response to no longer relevant
concerns about the potential increase of juvenile crime. Since that time, the policy has resulted in thousands of
youths being tried as adults without a hearing before a juvenile court judge; and

Page 7 of 10

 WHEREAS, according to analysis by the John Jay College of Criminal Justice there is no correlation between the
transferring of juveniles to adult court and the drop in youth violence across the country; and
WHEREAS, the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention has stated that the “bulk of the empirical
evidence suggests that [juvenile] transfer laws have little or no general deterrent effect;” and
