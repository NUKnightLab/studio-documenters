 EXPLANATION
On April 1, 2009, the CHA’s Occupancy Department entered into a contract for tenant screening
services with Screening Reports, Inc. The vendor was chosen due to the fact that Screening
Reports, Inc. offered a suite of screening and background reporting services at a competitive
price, including (1) most comprehensive screening packet for the per person cost (multi-county
criminal and eviction services as well as national criminal search, and multi-state sex offender
searches), (2) ongoing post-occupancy crime alerts of individuals, (3) social security trace and
verification, and (4) customized scoring models to assist in objective readings of reports.
To ensure continued compliance with the CHA HCV Administrative Plan and HUD 24 CFR
982.553 for the Housing Choice Voucher Program, HCVP screens adult household members for
certain types of criminal activity before admission to the program, at a move, for adult additions
to the household, or head of household changes. Consequently, the CHA contracts a screening
company to conduct the criminal background checks. The background check is then provided to
CHA for a final determination for assistance.
As a result of the additional volume that Screening Reports, Inc. will gain upon adding the HCV
program to the contract, the vendor has agreed to lower the current pricing of $10.50 per
Complete Criminal Background search report and Social Security Trace, currently provided to
the CHA, to the cost of $6.00 per report. Consequently, this permits both the Public Housing side
and the Housing Choice Voucher Program to pay the same amount for the same report. The
Option year pricing will also change to reflect the lower pricing.
Screening Reports, Inc. has agreed to provide the CHA with segregated billing for the
Occupancy and HCV program. Screening Reports, Inc. will assign different account numbers to
the two areas respectively to avoid comingling of the billing for the respective CHA departments
and programs.
In addition, Screening Reports, Inc. uses credit industry standard security. Screening Reports,
Inc. is an approved integration partner with Yardi for many versions of their software. The entire
integration focuses on removing the risks and inefficiencies of double data entry and is achieved
via one way integration (from Yardi to Screening Reports, Inc.).
Based on the foregoing, it is in the best interest of the CHA to authorize the Chief Executive
Officer or his designee to amend the Contract Number 9009 with Screening Reports Inc. to
provide tenant services screening services to the HCV Program and increase the Contract by an
amount not to exceed $140,000.00. The contract’s new aggregate not-to-exceed funding amount
will be $382,000.00.
