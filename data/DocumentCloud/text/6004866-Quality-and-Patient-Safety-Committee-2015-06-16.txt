Report from Chief Quality Officer
A. Report – Infection Control (Attachment #1)
Dr. Sharon Welbel, System Director of Infection Control, provided an overview of the Report on Infection Control.
The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
During the discussion of the information on Central Line Associated Blood Stream Infections (CLABSI), Dr.
Welbel noted that the definition of CLABSI changed in 2015; basically, things that were not previously counted as
a healthcare-associated central line infection are now being counted. Additionally, the Centers for Disease Control
has not changed their standard infection rate to reflect the new definition; however, they are going to change it at
the end of 2015. These two changes will likely affect the rates.
Dr. Welbel provided information on interventions put in place to prevent these infections, including having only
certain trained medical staff and attending physicians insert central lines. Director Lerner inquired if the goal in
training staff is to have all healthcare professionals who associate with patients to have that core competency, or to
have a small cadre of people who do that specialized task. Dr. Welbel responded that everybody who inserts
central lines and peripherally-inserted central catheter (PIC) lines has to have specialized training.
During the discussion of hand hygiene compliance, Chairman Gugenheim inquired regarding the rules for hand
hygiene. Dr. Welbel responded that the rules are that staff are to clean their hands prior to going into the room,
and are to clean their hands upon exit of the room. The Committee discussed the subject of technologies that are
being developed, such as badge-associated sensors, monitors and dispensers of handgel. Dr. John Jay Shannon,
Chief Executive Officer, noted that the administration has begun to review these types of technologies; however, in
the absence of culture change, these may not be effective.

Report from Chief Quality Officer
A. Report – Infection Control (continued)
During the discussion of the information presented on endoscopy-related infections, Dr. Welbel stated that, with
regard to the frequency of use, she surmised that approximately two or more scopes are used per day at the System;
in contrast, other hospitals use approximately two per month. The System constantly re-processes its scopes;
management is in the process of purchasing more scopes. Dr. Shannon noted that recently, the Finance Committee
and Board approved a multi-million dollar purchase of scopes and Steris cleaning machines.
Board Chairman Hammock inquired how Infection Control information is communicated amongst the staff;
additionally, he inquired how the policies are enforced, and whether units are rewarded for success. Dr. Welbel
stated that there is an Infection Control intranet site available for staff that contains updated surveillance data and
policies. Data is physically posted in the units; she noted that every unit is assigned an infection preventionist who
communicates this information to the unit. With regard to a reward/recognition system, she stated that this has
been done in the past; she noted that it is challenging to maintain while there are competing issues like Ebola and
Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) that arise.
Dr. Welbel provided a brief update on activities related to the recent Ebola outbreak. With the assistance of staff
from Information Technology, an electronic screening tool was developed. Over 650,000 people were screened for
Ebola. Of those, there were 9 people who were found to meet the screening criterion; 4 of the 9 people were true
positives, meaning they said yes to all of the screening questions. Staff from the Division of Infectious Diseases
examined those 4 patients; an alternative diagnosis was found in all 4 patients. Staff are now implementing
something like that for MERS, which is probably the biggest new emerging problem.

B. Regulatory and Accreditation Updates
Dr. Krishna Das, Chief Quality Officer, provided a brief update on regulatory and accreditation matters. She stated
that staff continue their preparations for the full accreditation survey by The Joint Commission (TJC) at Stroger
Hospital; the survey will occur anytime between now and November.
Dr. Das stated that efforts continue with the roll-out of the Primary Care Medical Home (PCMH) program in all of
the Ambulatory settings; most of the clinics have kicked off very intense preparations for this.

C. Metrics (Attachment #2)
Dr. Das reviewed the presentation on Metrics. The Committee discussed the information.
With regard to the measures relating to Operating Room (OR) Efficiency, Director Lerner indicated that he
would appreciate having the director of that project come and make a presentation to the Committee; he
inquired whether this can be scheduled soon. He noted that he does not want to do this after they have
implemented it; rather, he would like to see pre- and post-implementation presentations. He would like to know
the project plan and what they are trying to accomplish, along with the outcomes and the evaluation. Following
its execution, the Committee can discuss the evaluation. Dr. Das stated that this should be feasible for the next
month’s meeting.

D. Report – Patient Experience (Attachment #3)
Dr. Das reviewed the presentation on Patient Experience. The Committee discussed the information.

Report from Chief Quality Officer
D. Report – Patient Experience (continued)
Director Junge inquired whether surveys go out to not only the patients of the CCHHS clinics, but also to
patients of the network clinics. Dr. Das responded that, for this survey, when she refers to clinics, she is only
referring to those 16 CCHHS Ambulatory Services clinics. Separately, the Managed Care operation needs to
get feedback from all of its members, who may use the network clinics; Managed Care does survey its
members, but that is a separate survey.
Board Chairman Hammock inquired whether the System’s affiliation agreements require its partners to survey
their own patients. He asked Elizabeth Reidy, General Counsel, whether there are quality reporting
requirements in those agreements. Ms. Reidy responded in the affirmative; she stated that they are required
under the System’s agreement with the State, and are included in those agreements, as well. Dr. Shannon stated
that staff will follow-up on the question relating to patient satisfaction surveys conducted by the System’s
partners. Director Lerner noted that this subject will also be discussed in the Managed Care Committee.
Following the review of the presentation, Director Lerner inquired whether Dr. Das could estimate when the
administration can start thinking about perhaps aspiring toward designation of Magnet status for nursing or
working towards being considered for the Baldrige Award. Dr. Das stated that, most optimistically, changing a
culture takes three years; additionally, it is critical to have extremely enlightened management at all levels.
Board Chairman Hammock stated that perhaps the place to start is by setting standards at the 85th percentile
across the board; once those standards are being met, that would seem to be the trigger that says - let’s go for it.
Chairman Gugenheim indicated that if there is anything the Board can do to help reach this goal in terms of
support or resources, the administration should let them know.

IV.

Action Items
A. Request for the Committee’s recommendation to amend the clinical training affiliations approved by
the CCHHS Board of Directors on May 31, 2015 (Attachment #4)
Dr. John O’Brien, Director of Professional Education, provided an overview of the amended list of clinical
training affiliations. The Board of Directors approved a group of affiliations on May 29, 2015; however, the
affiliation with McGaw for OB/Gyne was inadvertently not included in that approved list. Therefore, the list is
being re-presented with the inclusion of the McGaw OB/Gyne agreement; the Committee is respectfully asked
to approve the list, as amended.
Director Marsh recused herself from the discussion and consideration of the item.
Director Lerner, seconded by Chairman Gugenheim, moved to approve the proposed list
of clinical training affiliations presented for the Committee’s consideration, as amended.
THE MOTION CARRIED.
