WHEREAS, the month of October is recognized as Breast Cancer Awareness Month; and
WHEREAS, in the United States about one (1) in eight (8) women will develop invasive breast cancer
over the course of her lifetime; and
WHEREAS, in 2018, an estimated 266,120 new cases of invasive breast cancer were expected to be
diagnosed in women in the U.S., along with 63,960 new cases of non-invasive (in situ) breast cancer; and
WHEREAS, about 2,550 new cases of invasive breast cancer were expected to be diagnosed in men in
2018. A man’s lifetime risk of breast cancer is about 1 in 1,000; and
WHEREAS, Breast cancer incidence rates in the Unite States began decreasing in the year 2000, after
increasing for the previous two decades. They dropped by 7% from 2002 to 2003 alone; and

therapy (HRT) by woman after the results of a large study called the Women’s Health Initiative were

published in 2002. These results suggested a connection between HRT and increased breast cancer risk;
and
WHEREAS, about 40,920 women in the United States were expected to die in 2018 from breast cancer,
though death rates have been decreasing since 1989, with larger decreases in women under the age of 50.
These decreases are thought to be result of treatment advances, earlier detection through screening, and
increased awareness; and
WHEREAS, for women in the United States, breast cancer death rates are higher than those for any other
cancer, besides lung cancer; and
WHEREAS, white women are slightly more likely to develop breast cancer than African-American
women. However, in women under 45, breast cancer is more common in African-American women than
white women. Overall, African - American women are more likely to die of breast cancer. Asian, Hispanic,
and Native-American women have a lower risk of developing and dying from breast cancer; and
WHEREAS, in 2018, there are more the 3.1 million women with a history of breast cancer in the United
States. This includes women currently being treated and women who have finished treatment.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and Members of the Board of
Commissioners, on behalf of more than 5.2 million residents of Cook County, do hereby take this
opportunity to acknowledge Breast Cancer Awareness Month; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a suitable copy of this Resolution be spread upon the official

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF DION ELIOT MILLER-PÉREZ
WHEREAS, Almighty God in His infinite wisdom has called Dion Eliot Miller-Pérez from our midst on
July 26, 2018 at the age of 56; and
WHEREAS, Dion was born in Chicago, Illinois on October 24, 1961 to Dr. Angela Pérez-Miller and John
Miller; and
WHEREAS, Dion learned his work at the feet of his mother, Dr. Angela Pérez-Miller, an educator and
activist and was inspired by her to be a leader and voice for the oppressed; and

powerful man; and
WHEREAS, in 1988, Dion married his soul mate, Susan Mullen, an artist and longtime art teacher at Wells
High School; and
WHEREAS, earlier in life, Dion took a shot at being a political headliner, running for the 12th Ward
aldermanic seat, but he found his home behind the scenes, training volunteers and managing campaigns,
which suited his natural gift for teaching, building relationships and community organizing; and
WHEREAS, when the City of Chicago founded Local School Councils (LSC), Dion was among the first
elected to serve. He served at three elementary school councils: Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz, Burroughs
Elementary School and William F. Finkl Academy; and
WHEREAS, as a staffer for the Neighborhood Capital Budget Group, Dion fought for equity in school
construction spending which he cared deeply about; and
WHEREAS, at the Cross-City Campaign for Urban School Reform, Dion dedicated his time to teaching
LSCs and community organizations how to evaluate local schools and district budgets; and
WHEREAS, the most formative experience of his career came between 2005 and 2009, when Dion served
as Executive Director of the Telpochcalli Community Education Project (TCEP). There, Dion created space
for women and young people in Little Village, his neighborhood, to build community, speak truth to power
and forge their own destinies; and
WHEREAS, when nonprofits were struggling during the recession, Dion chose to move on and made room
for longtime organizer María Velázquez to move into the role of executive director; and
WHEREAS, Dion served in the Cook County Board of Commissioner’s Office, Cook County Justice
Advisory Council, and the Cook County Department of Human Rights and Ethics; and
WHEREAS, although he loved to write, Dion’s legacy will not only live in his writings - it will be most
pronounced in the lives of the many young people of Little Village he nurtured-artists, fighters and
community builders-including his three (3) sons; and
