2. The exterior cladding materials, “Granite Red Colonial” by Sioux City
Brick and the TerraClad system in “Slate” through-body color and
natural finish, are approved as proposed. As proposed, the window
frame color shall be “Burnt Umber” to complement the existing
windows on the historic building;

the north and south elevations shall be submitted to Historic
