In order to close out an account for ADT professional security services for the 6th District office
in the end of the Commissioner’s term, the balance was paid from our facilities and office space
rental budget. This left a shortfall for the duration of the lease for facilities and office space rental
budget and the utility budget for the 6th district office which was approaching as the Commissioner’s
term in office was coming to an end. The transfer amount from the salary and wages fund to the
facilities rental and utility funds is to make the final payments for the rental of the district office
and the final utility bills through the end of the lease agreement which is also the conclusion of the
Commissioner’s term in office.

for temporary staffing.

delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that

media and others will allow the 2020 Census message to reach a broader audience, providing trusted advocates
who can spark positive conversations about the 2020 Census ensuring that all communities are informed about
the importance of the 2020 United States Census and that every resident is counted.

RESOLUTION SUPPORTING THE DEVELOPMENT OF WORKER COOPERATIVES
IN COOK COUNTY, ILLINOIS
WHEREAS, a “worker cooperative” is a business that is cooperatively owned and controlled by its workers;
and
WHEREAS, the worker cooperative model has proven to be an effective tool for creating and maintaining
sustainable, dignified jobs; generating wealth; improving the quality of life of workers; and promoting
community and local economic development, particularly for people who lack access to conventional means
of business ownership; and
WHEREAS, many worker cooperatives in the United States today were designed to improve low- wage jobs
and build wealth in communities most directly affected by inequality; and
WHEREAS, a 2009 University of Wisconsin study reported that there are an estimated 350 worker
cooperatives throughout the country with a combined estimated total revenue of $365 million, and it is believed
these estimates are much larger today; and
WHEREAS, the local economy has lost thousands of well-paying manufacturing jobs that have mostly been
replaced by minimum or low-wage service industry work and has expanded barriers to economic mobility for
people of color, returning citizens, and immigrants; and
WHEREAS, there is a growing number of worker cooperatives throughout Cook County that currently lack
access to capital, public awareness of the worker cooperative model, training and support services, and also
face significant legal complexity; and
WHEREAS, the mandate of the Cook County Bureau of Economic Development includes fostering business
growth, attraction, and retention; supporting workforce development, job creation, and sustainable
employment; and, encouraging sustainable community investment; and
WHEREAS, worker cooperatives employ less common governance and financial structures, and because the
County currently lacks programming and resources to help these beneficial enterprises thrive.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners supports the
development and growth of worker cooperatives; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners celebrates the tremendous
benefits of worker cooperatives in Cook County and supports the movement to create more worker cooperatives
throughout the region; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, the Cook County Bureau of Economic Development is encouraged to
consider use of community development block grant (CDBG) funding where appropriate and other appropriate

89

 Board of Commissioners

Journal of Proceedings

sources of funding to support local worker cooperatives and cooperative conversions, strengthen existing
organizations that are incubating and training worker cooperatives in Cook County, and help to equip other
organizations to provide such services, focusing on services to low‐income residents or in underserved areas;
and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, the Bureau of Economic Development is encouraged to help worker
cooperatives access tailored resources created by community organizations and make referrals to technical
assistance providers for individuals seeking to launch new worker cooperatives or convert conventional
businesses to worker ownership, as well as seek opportunities to partner with worker cooperative initiatives
such as the Chicagoland Cooperative Ecosystem Coalition on worker cooperative education initiatives; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, it is recommended that educational materials produced to serve as a resource
for worker cooperatives and data on related outreach and funding be made publicly available on an annual basis
where appropriate as determined by the partnerships created through this effort; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, the federal, state and city of Chicago governments are encouraged to take
steps to support worker cooperatives.

PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT
REQUIRING A TWO THIRDS MAJORITY VOTE OF THE BOARD TO ENACT ANY NEW OR

not be left to a simple majority vote, and
WHEREAS, the process of both increasing taxes and creating new taxes should be agreed upon by a large
majority of those who will be effected by them, and
WHEREAS, the board should establish the requirement that all new taxes and new tax increases can only be

thirds majority vote of the board in order to pass. A vote of “present shall not be counted in determining the
number of Commissioners voting on a question

WHEREAS, the 2020 Census poses unprecedented challenges that may inhibit an accurate count of the United
States population such as a drastic reduction in field staff and the primary use of an online platform for the first
time; and
WHEREAS, among these challenges, the inclusion of an untested citizenship question has been proposed by
the Department of Commerce and accurate and reliable information on how the Census Bureau will handle this
question is not yet available; and
WHEREAS, Cook County has the largest concentration of foreign-born residents in the state of Illinois and
must be prepared to educate this population on the importance of participating in the Census to avoid an
undercount; and
WHEREAS, immigrants are among the hard-to-count populations that have experienced an undercount in the
past, with 11,000 very young Latino children having been missed in Cook County alone during the 2010
Census; and
WHEREAS, Illinois experienced total undercounts of 100,000 persons in 2000 and 128,000 in 2010 which
cost Cook County an estimated $19 - $25 million per year after each decennial survey based on the 2002 US
Census Monitoring Committee report to Congress and the 2018 report from the George Washington Institute
on Public Policy ; and
WHEREAS, it is expected that with limited information on the citizenship question and the chilling effect this
population is already experiencing due to increased immigration enforcement, the number of persons missed
in an undercount will only increase; and
WHEREAS, based on the Fiscal Year 2017 Annual Report on federal awards issued to Cook County, fourteen
of the grants Cook County receives, which total over $43 million, are reliant on U.S. Census population data;
and

 Board of Commissioners

Journal of Proceedings

October 17, 2018

WHEREAS, without special efforts to ensure an accurate count of immigrant residents, Cook County is primed
not only to lose financially, but is leaving the civil rights and fair representation of its entire population at stake;
and

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that an Emergency Fund be established to conduct specialized
outreach to immigrant communities throughout Cook County; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a minimum of $200,000 from the $600,000 expected surplus in
operating funds described in the Fiscal Year 2018 Year-End Projections be allocated to this Fund under the
direction of the Chief Financial Officer to temporarily hire two (2) staff to manage the outreach and report to
members of the Cook County Complete Count Committee and the Board of Commissioners.

URGING PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP AND THE DEPARTMENT OF
HOMELAND SECURITY TO MAINTAIN THE CURRENT INTERPRETATION OF THE
PUBLIC CHARGE RULE AND OPPOSING ANY FEDERAL REGULATORY CHANGE
THAT WOULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT IMMIGRANT FAMILIES
WHEREAS, Cook County is a “Fair and Equal County for Immigrants” as defined in 07-R-240; and
WHEREAS, on October 10, 2018 the Federal Register published a proposed rule developed by the United
States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that would drastically change the “public charge” test for
individuals seeking admission to or legal permanent residency in the United States; and
WHEREAS, “public charge” currently refers to a person who is likely to become “primarily dependent” on
government services and as such may be barred from entering or gaining lawful status in the United States or;
and
WHEREAS, at present, public charge is limited to being a direct recipient of cash assistance including General
Assistance (GA), the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, or Supplemental Security
Income (SSI), or institutionalized long-term care at the government’s expense; and

166

 Board of Commissioners

Journal of Proceedings

October 17, 2018

WHEREAS, the proposed rule changes public charge to consider likely use of or receipt of non-cash assistance
including non-emergency Medicaid, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the low-income
prescription drug subsidy for Medicare Part D, and certain federal housing benefit programs; and
WHEREAS, the proposed rule would also require DHS to consider the person’s age; medical condition; family
status; household assets, resources, and financial status; and education and skills in determining whether that
person is likely to become a public charge; and
WHEREAS, children, older adults, individuals with limited education and/or limited English proficiency, and
those with household income less than 250% of the federal poverty level will face more difficulty getting
approval to enter the United States or gain lawful status; and
WHEREAS, over half a million residents of Cook County - more than one tenth of the population - are noncitizens; and
WHEREAS, over 94,000 children in Illinois live in a household with at least one non-citizen receiving SNAP
and those households make up over 10% of Cook County households receiving SNAP; and
WHEREAS, the promulgation of the proposed rule may result in a significant “chilling effect” that will lead
to many eligible households dis-enrolling from or forgoing enrollment into benefits that help address basic
human needs such as health care, food/nutrition, and housing; and
WHEREAS, DHS’s proposed rule outlines possible impacts on those otherwise eligible for benefits, including
“worse health outcomes, including increased prevalence of obesity and malnutrition, especially for pregnant or
breastfeeding women, infants, or children, and reduced prescription adherence”; and
WHEREAS, the proposed rule further outlines a direct impact on health systems with “increased use of
emergency rooms and emergent care as a method of primary health care due to delayed treatment”; “increased
prevalence of communicable diseases, including members of the United States citizen population who are not
vaccinated”; “increases in uncompensated care”; and
WHEREAS, in addition to public health, the proposed rule would impact overall social mobility as it would
create “increased rates of poverty and housing instability”; and “reduced productivity and educational
attainment.”; and
WHEREAS, an estimated $92 million annually is estimated to be lost by Cook County residents if at least a
quarter of households with at least one immigrant who receive these benefits were to withdraw from or forgo
enrollment; and
WHEREAS, promulgation of the proposed public charge rule would exacerbate heightened fear and anxiety
in the immigrant community and force many Cook County residents to make difficult decisions about accessing
basic services such as health care and nutrition assistance programs; and
WHEREAS, more than 50,000 households in Cook County include at least one (1) immigrant enrolled in
Medicaid; and
WHEREAS, the loss of Medicaid for Cook County residents could result in significant increases in

167

Journal of Proceedings

October 17, 2018

uncompensated care and decreased patient revenue from Medicaid reimbursement for Cook County Health and
Hospitals System and other hospital and healthcare providers in Cook County; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners opposes any proposed change to the public charge
rule which could negatively impact residents in Cook County.
NOW, THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners opposes any
federal regulatory change that would negatively impact immigrant families and urges President Donald Trump
and the Department of Homeland Security to immediately withdraw the proposed public charge rule; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County State’s Attorney send a response to the Federal
Register, under the rule making powers of the federal rules, indicating to the Department of Homeland Security
how strongly we are opposed to the proposed public charge rule; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Secretary to the Board of Commissioners transmit a suitable copy
of this Resolution to the President of the United States, the Secretary of the United States Department of
Homeland Security and the members of the Illinois Congressional Delegation.
Approved and adopted this 17th of October 2018.
