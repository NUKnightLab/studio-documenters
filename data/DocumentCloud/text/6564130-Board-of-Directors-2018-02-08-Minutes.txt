Ms. Linda Stemheimer addressed the Board ofDircctors and referred to a presentation attached hereto
as ?Exhibit (slides She introduced Mr. Tim Donovan, Executive Director, Canalway
Partners. Director Roller asked whether the plan is connected to the lawsuit that the Port was
dismissed from and USACE remained a party. Mr. Donovan replied yes, part of the lawsuit was that
a mitigation process must be developed to repair the damage to the Hulett?s. The court ordered the
USACE to redo the permitting process so the Port could dredge. The settlement allows the USACE
to issue a permit to the Port. Parties agree that this is suf?cient mitigation. Currently, there is no
active court case. Director Hoogenboom asked whether any dredging was done at the bulk terminal
during the duration of reaching an agreement. Mr, Friedman replied no dredging was completed.
Dredging will be performed at the berth after the bulkhead rehabilitation.

Agenda Item (2) (A) Inclusion Policy Discussion

 

Director Moore addressed the Board of Directors and referred to a presentation attached hereto as
?Exhibit Director Moore stated that the second bullet on slide 2 states a broad conclusion
without providing any detailed support or method as to how it was reached. He suggested
unpacking the statement in the second bullet on slide 2 to begin. Mr. Friedman referred to
?Exhibit and stated that the statement in the first slide is his conclusion and offered to share
his thought process. He stated that the point he intended to make was that workforce development
in the community is a major issue. The Port is involved in economic development and is therefore
well positioned to contribute to finding a solution. Director Moore stated that the Port wanting to
contribute to finding a solution is not the same as what is written in slide 2. The goal should be to
determine how the Port can make a contribution. Mr. Friedman stated that the Port is a leader in
the Maritime community, and the Port is uniquely positioned to make improvements within its
sphere of in?uence. Directors Ramsey, Ronayne, Roller, Applegate and Smith concurred that the
statement in bullet 2 is an appropriate starng point. Director Smith added that the statement offers
direction and having a discussion about how to reach the intended goals is important before any
voting were to take place. Director Applegate stated that workforce development is becoming a
trend, and the Port must be responsible in its approach. Director Moore stated that he doesn?t
have a problem with the idea, but it is lacking focus. Director Roller then requested the Mr.
Friedman proceed with the presentation so that the idea can be heard. Referring to slide 7, Director
Roller noted that the Cuyahoga County is engaged in workforce development discussions. The
Port could contribute as a funder to be at the table to discuss and contribute to the effort. Director
Hoogenboom suggested having regular workforce development updates at future Board Meetings.

On motion by Director Ramsey, seconded by Director Smith, and unanimously carried by roll call
