MEMORANDUM - REVISED 12/5/19

Budget Committee Members

From:

Greg Stevens, Associate Director, Federal & State Grants Unit

Date:

Subject:

FFY16 Victims of Crime Act Plan Adjustment
FFY17 Victims of Crime Act Plan Adjustment

This memo describes recommended FFY16 Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) designation
reductions and recommended FFY17 VOCA designations.
A. DESIGNATION REDUCTIONS
Funds returned to ICJIA by agencies at the ends of the funding performance periods are listed in
the tables below. FFY16 funds have expired and are no longer available for use.
Illinois Coalition Against Sexual Assault
The Illinois Coalition Against Sexual Assault (ICASA) Lead Entity Services to Victims of
Sexual Assault program will lapse $2,286,212 of its $18.2 million FFY16 designation. This lapse
was caused by delays in ICJIA’s release of the Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO), which
caused delays in the opening of the ICASA competitive application process. There was also
miscommunication between ICJIA and ICASA concerning allowable use of funds.
The initial designation given to ICASA was not completely awarded during the first application
process, and an additional RFP was let to supplement those programs that were originally
selected. This was caused by initial confusion by the agency on new Lead Entity requirements.
Additional FFY16 funds provided to the Lead Entities for technology and equipment were also
not completely spent as budgeted.
Illinois Coalition Against Domestic Violence
The Illinois Coalition Against Domestic Violence (ICADV) Lead Entity Services to Victims of
Domestic Violence program will lapse $2,055,122 of its $19.2 million FFY16 designation. This
lapse was caused by delays in ICJIA release of the NOFO, which caused delays in the opening of
the ICADV competitive application process, so subgrantee programs were not provided with the
entire 12 months to expend the funds awarded. Additional FFY16 funds provided to the Lead
Entities for technology and equipment were also not completely spent as budgeted.

Children’s Advocacy Centers of Illinois
The Children’s Advocacy Centers of Illinois Lead Entity Services to Child Advocacy Centers
program will lapse $1,315,412 of the $9 million in FFY16 funds. Funds awarded for equipment
and technology were not fully obligated by the end of the performance period.
Community Violence
The Community Violence programs listed below returned large percentages of their designations
because of contractual delays and program staffing issues. These agencies were funded under a
new program area developed to support 2017 VOCA priorities. Subcontract and unallowable
cost issues delayed the review process and program start dates. Many grantees are hospitals that
cannot hire without a signed agreement, further delaying program implementation. Many
programs were not fully implemented until six to nine months after the designated start date.
