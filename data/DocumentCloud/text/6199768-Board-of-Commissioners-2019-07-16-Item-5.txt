 North Sheffield Development

Background
The Sheffield Development will include the Edith Spurlock Sampson Apartments and Annex,
located in the Lincoln Park Community. The project entails the redevelopment of the existing
Senior Towers, and the new construction of a 6-story bridge residential apartment building with
two floors of amenity spaces in between the two towers.
The redevelopment will include new amenity spaces for seniors consisting of a large
dining/community room, exterior courtyard, living room and reception areas, meeting room,
computer room, second floor laundry rooms, outdoor porch, coffee lounge and game room, and
an exercise room. The development will also include 50 surface parking spaces, of which 8
parking spaces will be accessible.
The site is within walking distance of CTA Bus routes and is a block away from the CTA Brown Line
station at Diversey. A full-service grocery store, pharmacy, restaurants and many other amenities
are within walking distance from the site. Agassiz Elementary School and Lincoln Park High
School are within a half mile of the property.
Owner/Developer
The CHA, through a Joint Venture Partnership with PIRHL, will co-develop the Sheffield
Development. In November 2017, the CHA Board approved the selection of PIHRL as CHA’s joint
venture partner for the redevelopment of Edith Spurlock Sampson Apartments and Annex
(Spurlock Sampson) located at 2640-2720 North Sheffield. The resolution number is 2017-CHA121.

 CHA Financing
The not-to-exceed total CHA funding of $14,000,000 will provide funds for CHA’s RAD/PBV units
in addition to the already approved predevelopment loan funds of $2,129,775 that were
approved by the CHA Board on March 20, 2018, resolution number 2018-CHA-17. The
development budget is subject to HUD RAD rents, CHA PBV, an Illinois Housing Development
Authority soft loan, and the construction contract.
