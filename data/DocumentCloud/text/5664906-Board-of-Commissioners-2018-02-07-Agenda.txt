Total Amount of Transfer: $18,000.00
On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of

On January 22nd it became apparent that a funds transfer would be needed in the Branch Court program
Institutional Supplies. Therefore, funds will be transferred into account 333 program 11375. There was a
typo when funds were initially loaded-funds were loaded into account 330 instead of 333.
How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified?
accounts that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.

delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result
in the account that funds are transferred from.

Summary:
This three month extension would allow Sentinel Offender services, LLC to continue to
provide electronic monitoring and Global Positioning System (GPS) services for the Adult Probation
Department and Juvenile Probation and Court Services Department for minor and adult clients who are
ordered by the court to wear electronic monitoring devices. Sentinel provides GPS monitoring equipment
and services for adult probationers and pretrial defendants in order to comply with Public Act 95-0773,
also known as the Cindy Bischof Law, which calls for the monitoring of certain domestic violence
offenders through GPS technology. The law allows the court to order adults charged with certain domestic
violence offenses to be monitored electronically by the Adult Probation Department Home Confinement
Unit as a condition of bail or probation. Offenders are ordered to wear a GPS tracking device to help
monitor compliance with orders to stay away from the complaining witness, the complaining witness’s
home/workplace, or any other protected address specified. There are currently more than 210 adults
under GPS monitoring and 110 victims who carry GPS devices to create mobile exclusion zones. Effective
on 1/1/2015, new legislation (Public Act 98-1012, 725 ILCS 5/110-5) significantly expanded the types of

charges required to be considered for GPS monitoring as a condition of bail.
GPS technology is used by the Juvenile Probation and Court Services Department to monitor high-risk
youth in home confinement as an alternative to secure detention or as a condition of release into the
community. These devices are deployed at various points of the judicial process from pre- adjudication
through post-dispositional stages of court proceedings. For the month of November 2017, there were 381
court-involved youth under GPS electronic surveillance, 55% of whom are on pretrial status. .
A new Request for Proposal process is concluding for a new contract. The extension provides a brief
period of time as a contingency to transition services to a new provider.
The contract was awarded through the Request for Proposals (RFP) process in accordance with the
CookCounty Procurement Code. Sentinel Offender Services, LLC. was awarded this contract based on
established evaluation criteria

Summary: On 2/5/2013, the Cook County Board of Commissioners approved a ten-month contract with
Heartland Human Care Services, Inc. to manage the Cook County Juvenile Detention Reduction Project
(DRP) to serve court-involved, moderate and high-risk youth in jeopardy of imminent referral to the
Juvenile Temporary Detention Center due to non-compliance with court orders.

The DRP augments the court’s nationally recognized Juvenile Detention Alternatives Initiative which is a
continuum of community-based services that judges and probation officers may use to divert at-risk minors
from detention. Both the Initiative and the DRP programs allow minors to remain in their communities and
engage in pro-social interventions. The DRP currently provides services to youth living in targeted
Chicago communities. The contract provides a wide range of interventions and mentoring, including
educational, therapeutic and recreational programming, which responds to the needs of the juveniles who
are referred to participate in this project. Heartland partners with 13 faith-based and other community
based-agencies to facilitate direct access to services and care. Since the beginning of the project, more
than 3,750 referrals have been processed for DRP services.
The request for the increase is to continue services until a new contract is executed, while a
corresponding Request for Proposal (“RFP”) process is completed.
This is a Sole Source Contract pursuant to Section 34-139 of the Cook County Procurement Code.
