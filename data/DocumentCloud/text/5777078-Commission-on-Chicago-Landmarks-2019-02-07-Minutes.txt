nonhistoric, faux stone animal habitat at the north exterior elevation and portions of
interior walls, installation of a canopy at the north elevation, a new animal support
area including a new accessory structure north of the Lion House, removal of
nonhistoric incursions in the interior, installation of cantilevered and recessed glass

Action: Approved unanimously (3-0) with the following conditions:

the portals shall match existing. Detailed, dimensioned drawings
noting materials and finish of the newly exposed heads, jambs, sills
and columns shall be provided with permit plans for staff review and
approval;
2. As proposed, the cantilevered habitat cases shall maximize use of
clear glazing with minimal framing to create the most transparent
volumes possible within the Great Hall. Detailed, dimensioned
drawings noting materials and finish shall be provided with permit
plans for Historic Preservation staff review and approval;
3. As proposed, the enlargement of existing door openings on the
interior north elevation with reinstallation of a straight line of trim

proposed, carpeting shall be neutral in color;

 Exterior

beyond Zone “A” of Exhibit 1 of the Lion House landmark

nonhistoric elements from the north elevation, historic cladding is
missing outside of Zone “A,” it shall be replaced to match historic.
Samples of proposed replacement cladding shall be provided for
staff review and approval prior to order and installation; and
2. Further study and design development of the exterior accessible
entry designs B and G shall be undertaken to more definitively
