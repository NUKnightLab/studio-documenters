MONTHLY NEWS AND INFORMATION FROM YOUR RETIREMENT BOARD

Pre-Retirement Seminars
We are very pleased to announce that the 2019 pre-retirement seminars will be held at Guaranteed
Rate Field (Sox Park) in the Conference Center. The facility is centrally located, has ample parking,
better seating and enhanced presentation technology. The dates for the seminars are April 13th and
October 12th. Please contact the Fund at 312-726-5823 or via email at SEMINAR@FABF.ORG to
reserve a seat as seating will be limited. We would like to thank the Chicago White Sox for their
tremendous assistance in graciously hosting the seminars and wish the team the best of luck on the
upcoming season. We would like to add our thanks to FABF Fund President Dan Fortuna for his
efforts in securing the new location for our pre-retirement seminars. We hope the new location
provides the attendees with the finest experience possible.

Legislative Update
The FABF Board is monitoring the following Bills that have been introduced in the Illinois
Legislature and may impact the benefits of our members. We will update the membership of any
significant developments regarding the Bills listed below.
 HB 2451 (Martwick)/ SB 1747 (Cunningham)- Removes the birthdate restriction on eligibility
at age 55 for a 3% automatic annual increase in retirement annuity that is not subject to a
maximim increase of 30% for eligible Tier 1 pasrtticipants.


HB 2906 (Martwick)- Modification of Tier 2 salary calculation. Adds an alternative
calculation for final average salary to include the option of the average monthly salary
obtained by dividing the total salary of the fireman during the 48 consecutive months of
service within the last 120 months of service in which the total salary was the highest by the
number of months of service in that period



HB 2907 (Martwick)- Provides that the salary limitation on Tier 2 firemen shall be increased
annually by the annual unadjusted percentage increase in the CPI.



HB 2908 (Martwick)- Provides that the annual uncrease to a Tier 2 retirement annuity shall be
calculated at 3%.

 

HB 2911 (Martwick)- Provides that a fireman receiving a retirement annuity shall be entitled
to an occupational disease disability benefit if the fireman has not reached the age of
compulsatory retirement, has not been receiving a retirement annuity for more than 5 years,
and has a condition that would have qualified the fireman for an occupational disease
disability benefit if he or she was an active fireman.



HB 2978 (Martwick)- Provides for accelerated pension benefits. Requires the Pension Board
to implement an accelerated pension benefit payment option to allows firemen to elect to
reduce their retirement annuity by 25% in exchange for payment equal to 75% of present
value. The accelerated benefit cost shall not exceed $500 million.
