PROPOSED RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, the United States Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Medicare
and Medicaid Services, under the previous Administration, issued rules to restrict Medicaid payments to
public providers and to disallow Medicaid payments for Graduate Medical Education and for hospital
outpatient services (the “Proposed Medicaid Rules”), thus reducing the amount of money that will flow
through the Medicaid system to health care providers, to the Cook County Health and Hospitals System
and across the country; and
WHEREAS, the United States Congress is on record in opposition to the Proposed Medicaid Rules; and
WHEREAS, United States Senator Richard J. Durbin took a leadership role by introducing an
amendment to Public Law 110-28, the “U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans’ Health, and Iraq Accountability
Act, 2007” (the “Durbin Amendment”), with such amendment serving to place a one-year moratorium on
the Proposed Medicaid Rules; and
WHEREAS, with the active support of the Illinois Congressional Delegation, the Durbin Amendment
was included in Public Law 110-28, the “U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans’ Health, and Iraq
Accountability Act, 2007” and signed into law by President Bush; and
WHEREAS, this moratorium has been continued by the United States Congress and expires on April 1,
2009; and
WHEREAS, the United States House of Representatives has acted to extend the moratorium in H.R. 1,
“The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act,” to June 30, 2009; however, the United States Senate
currently does not intend to include an extension of the moratorium in its version of this bill; and
WHEREAS, the Proposed Medicaid Rules would reduce Medicaid payments to Cook County hospitals,
affecting not only Cook County and its most vulnerable citizens, but the entire public and private safetynet health care system in Cook County and in the State of Illinois.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners opposes the
Proposed Medicaid Rules and recognizes their potential impact on the Cook County public health system
as well as the overall health care system in the state of Illinois; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners hereby calls upon the
Illinois Congressional Delegation, in conjunction with the entire United States Congress, to continue its
opposition to the Proposed Medicaid Rules; and

ITEM #1 cont’d
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners urge the United States
Senate and the United States House of Representatives, in its conference on the economic recovery
legislation, to accept the House provision extending the moratorium through June 30, 2009 and calls on
the new Administration and the United States Department of Health and Human Services to dispose of
these pending regulations prior to June 30, 2009; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners recognizes the
invaluable leadership of Senator Richard J. Durbin and the Illinois Congressional Delegation in ensuring
that the Bush Administration’s effort to unfairly cut payments to public hospitals and other providers
throughout the nation is halted; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that we ask for your continued leadership to ensure that the Proposed
Medicaid Rules are disposed of by the new Administration; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Secretary of the Board is directed to deliver a suitable copy of
this Resolution to each member of the Illinois Congressional Delegation.

achievement was made possible through extensive retrofits and upgrades to the Dunne Building over a
number of years, planned and completed in collaboration between the Office of Capital Planning and
Policy and the 69 West Washington Management Company.
Improvements include replacement of lighting, use of occupancy sensors, installation of a solar-reflective
roof, upgrades to the building HVAC system, automation system, replacement of coils, dampers, controls,
frequency drives on chillers and refrigerant. These improvements made it possible for the building to
achieve an Energy Performance Rating of 89 on a scale of 1 to 100, with 75 being the minimum rating to
be eligible for Energy Star Certification.
