Transportation approval, be added to the highway system of Cook County.

PROPOSED TRANSFER OF FUNDS
Department: Transportation and Highways
Request: Approval of the Proposed Transfer of Funds
Reason: The incorrect expense account was budgeted for in FY 2018
From Account(s): 560155-501, $200,000.00, 560265-501, $600,000.00
To Account(s): 550100-501, $200,000.00, 550060-501, 600,000.00
Total Amount of Transfer: $800,000.00
On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
On 11/1/2018 the Department of Transportation and Highways was advised of the need to correct for an
account series in FY 2018 for the 560 series of expense accounts. The 560 series of expense accounts is
to be utilized for Capital Budget expenses only and not for Operating Account expenses. DOTH requests
to transfer our FY 2018 approved operating funds to the 550 series of expense accounts for proper
capture of the expenditures.

Journal of Proceedings

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
The accounts were used for Institutional and Vehicle Supplies/Equipment Rentals.
Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from.
None
If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
The Department of Transportation and Highways budgeted FY 2018 funds utilizing a numerical series of
an expense account that should not have been selected for our operating budget. The correct account
numerical series is 550. The funds in the 560 have been expended and transfer request is to correct the
account series to properly capture expenditure.

Classification 6b that provides an applicant a reduction in the assessment level for an abandoned industrial
facility; and

buildings and other structures that, after having been vacant and unused for at least 24 continuous months,
have been purchased for value by a purchaser in whom the seller has no direct financial interest; and
WHEREAS, in the instance where the property does not meet the definition of abandoned property, the
municipality or the Board of Commissioners, may determine that special circumstances may exist that
justify finding that the property is abandoned for purpose of Class 6b; and
WHEREAS, in the case of abandonment of less than 24 months and purchase for value, by a purchaser in
whom the seller has no direct financial interest, the County may determine that special circumstances justify
finding the property is deemed abandoned; and

Summary: Contract 1753-16842 with Northwestern University provides for the operation and
management of the Juvenile Clinic, including forensic evaluations and related services to the judiciary for
youth and families involved in Juvenile Justice and Child Protection proceedings. The existing one-year
bridge contract with Northwestern is modified to increase and extend the contract for the provision of
forensic services at the Clinic while removing the provision of mental health services for youth detained in
the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center. Those services recently shifted to the Cook County Health and
Hospitals System. The two (2) year extension will continue forensic services in Juvenile Court while the
court works with the CCHHS to fully integrate mental health services for youth across the Juvenile Court
enterprise. In time, a Request for Proposal (RFP) will be completed for the provision of forensic services.
The contract is also modified to include insurance and indemnification provisions.
The Office of the Chief Judge is requesting the County to indemnify Northwestern University for actions
arising out of its contractual responsibilities. This is a sole source contract pursuant to Section 34-139 of
the Cook County Procurement Code.

funds either directly or indirectly, shall have prepared for it a brief explanatory statement or note
("fiscal note") which shall include a reliable estimate of the probable impact of such measure upon
the County's annual budget. The Cook County Chief Financial Officer shall prepare a fiscal impact
statement for all ordinances or resolutions that propose to or would otherwise:
i) expend any funds or increase or decrease the revenues of the County, either directly or
indirectly; or
ii) appropriate funds; or
iii) increase or decrease existing appropriations; or
iv) increase or decrease the fiscal liability of the County; or
v) sell or lease any County asset, including revenue streams from that asset, if the
anticipated revenue from the sale or lease of the asset is greater than $5,000,000,00.
(2) If an ordinance authorizes capital expenditures or appropriates funds for capital expenditures, a
fiscal note shall specify by year any principal and interest payments required to finance such capital
expenditures. In addition, increased operational costs, by year, shall be specified. In no event shall
a fiscal note be required to estimate out-year costs for more than five years.
(c) Responsibility and deadline for furnishing the fiscal note.
1. The Secretary of the Board chief sponsor of the item under consideration shall request, promptly
after the introduction of the measure before the County Board, the Chief Financial Officer of the

before the County Board setting forth the information specified in this Section regarding any
measure.
2. The fiscal impact statement shall be provided to all Commissioners at least 72 hours prior to the
consideration of the ordinance or resolution by the Board of Commissioners; provided a request by
a Commissioner to prepare the fiscal impact statement is made earlier, the Chief Financial Officer
shall prepare the fiscal impact statement and provide it to the Commissioner within 48 hours of
such request.
(2) (3) No measure may be called for a final vote by the County Board until delivery of the fiscal
note according to the provisions of this Section, except that whenever, because of the complexity
of the measure, additional time is required for the preparation of the fiscal note the Chief Financial
Officer shall provide each member of the County Board and the President of the County Board
with a statement of reasons why the fiscal note cannot be supplied in seven business days, and
request an extension of time not to exceed five additional business days within which such fiscal
note is to be furnished. Such extension shall be granted only with the consent of the majority of the
members of the County Board and shall not extend beyond the end of the fiscal year in which the
request was made. In no event may such extensions be used to unduly delay or hinder the
consideration of the measure by the County Board. The County Board shall authorize the drafting
of any rules of regulations which shall be subject to County Board approval, to ensure compliance
with this Section.
(3)(4) In connection with the preparation of the fiscal note, all County officials and employees shall
upon request cooperate with the Chief Fiscal Officer in providing information.

(d) Form and content.
1. The fiscal note shall be factual in nature, as brief and concise as may be, and shall provide as
reliable an estimate, in dollars, as is possible under the circumstances. The fiscal note shall include
both the immediate effect, and if determinable or reasonably foreseeable, the long-range effect of
the measure.
2. If, after careful investigation it is determined that no dollar estimate is possible, the fiscal note shall
contain a statement to that effect, setting forth the reasons why no such estimate can be given. A
brief summary or work sheet of computations used in arriving at the fiscal note figures shall be
included.
(e) Preparation of fiscal note.
1. No comment or opinion shall be included in the fiscal note with regard to the merits of the measure
for which the fiscal note is prepared; however, technical or mechanical defects may be noted.
2. The work sheet shall include, insofar as practicable, a breakdown of the costs upon which the fiscal
note is based. Such breakdown shall include, but need not be limited to, costs of personnel,
materials and supplies, and capital outlay. The fiscal note shall also include such other information
as is required by the rules and regulations which may be promulgated by the County Board with
respect to the preparation of such fiscal notes. The fiscal impact statement shall, to the degree
possible, consist of an estimate in dollars of the anticipated change in revenue, expenditures, or
fiscal liability under the provisions of the ordinance or resolution. It shall also include a statement
as to the immediate effect and, if determinable or reasonably foreseeable, the long-range effect of
the measure. If after investigation, it is determined that no dollar estimate is possible, the fiscal
impact statement shall contain a statement to that effect, setting forth the reasons why no dollar
estimate can be given. The fiscal impact statement shall include an explanation of the basis or
reasoning on which the estimate is founded, including all assumptions involved. A copy of the
fiscal note shall be delivered to each member of the Board and the President of the County Board,
according to the provisions of subsection (b) of this Section.
3. The original of the fiscal note and the work sheet shall be signed by the Chief Financial Officer or
such person as the Chief Financial Officer may designate.
(f) No restrictions on committee testimony. The fact that a fiscal note is prepared for any measure shall not

employee of any County commission, department, agency or other entity who desires to be heard in support
of or in opposition to the measure.
Effective date: This ordinance shall be in effect immediately upon adoption...end
