 Background
The CHA seeks to enter into an intergovernmental agreement (IGA) with the City of Chicago to
exchange 6.5 acres of Stateway Gardens land to build a retail/commercial development. In
exchange, CHA will receive 6.7 acres of City-owned land, located south of Pershing Road (39th
Street) (the “City Land”) to build a mixed income residential development.
The City Land was once a part of the CHA’s Robert Taylor Homes redevelopment area and was
conveyed to the City through a previous IGA executed March 15, 2004. As part of the exchange,
CHA received comparable City land and CHA built Robert Taylor’s C2 offsite rental phase on
various parcels in the neighboring Bronzeville community.
This board action would enable the City to shift its planned commercial development from
south of Pershing Avenue to the north side of the street. Housing units that were slated for
delivery on the original Stateway Garden’s footprint will eventually be built on the acquired City
Land and/or in the surrounding community.
The commercial development will be located adjacent to the Park Boulevard community and
will benefit the Park Boulevard residents as well as the surrounding neighborhoods.
CHA intends to include the transferred City Land into its Stateway Revitalization plan, currently
under the oversight of the Stateway Gardens Working Group.
In order for the CHA to convey the former Stateway site land to the City and receive the City
Land in exchange, CHA needs HUD approval. All applicable HUD requirements for dispositions
of CHA Land will be satisfied prior to submission of application to HUD.
The total planned conveyance of the CHA land to the City is approximately 6.5 acres. The total
planned conveyance of the City Land to CHA is approximately 6.7 acres. The appraised value of
CHA land to be exchanged is approximately $2,550,000. The appraised value of the City Land to
be exchanged is approximately $2,800,000.
Respectfully Submitted:
