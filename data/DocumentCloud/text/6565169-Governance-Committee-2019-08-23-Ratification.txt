 BACKGROUND
Several attempts to amend the Code regarding Board membership,
but it failed because only four of the five counties would ratify the
amendment.

be altered, amended or repealed only upon written approval of
each County of the NOACA area

Limiting the ratification requirement to amendments to Section 4.2 only,
instead of all section of Article IV
Requiring approval of 4 out of 5 of the member counties for changes to
Article IV or Section 4.2

altogether
