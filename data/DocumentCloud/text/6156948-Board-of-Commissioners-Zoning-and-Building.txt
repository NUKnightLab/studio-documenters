Recommendation: ZBA Recommendation is of Approval with Conditions.

Conditions:
1. Limit the proposed use at the existing building at the current size.
2. Limit the repair work to Monday through Friday from 7:00 AM to 5:30 PM.
3. The service work within the facility shall be limited to minor maintenance, such as fluid changes, tire
changes, tune-ups, and replacement of lights, batteries, belts and windshield wipers; and no body work,
painting, brake testing, or engine rebuilding shall be performed within the facility. No heavy mechanical
work.
4. No outside contractors, only employees are to be used on site for repair work.
5. Only school buses and passenger vehicles be parked on the Subject Property. No tractor trailers are
to be parked on the Subject Property.
6. No more than two 2500 lbs. tanks are to be used for storage on the Subject Property.
7. On-site fuel tanks shall be installed above Flood Protection Elevation in accordance with the County
Floodplains Ordinance Sec. 106-9(1)a. It states that no installation in a flood zone that contains
flammable liquids or other hazardous materials can be below the “flood protection elevation (FPE).” In
Sec. 106-2 of the Floodplains Ordinance, “Flood Protection Elevation (FPE)” is defined as “the elevation
of the base flood or 100-year frequency flood plus two feet of freeboard….” Hence, the provision would
address concern that fuel containers be situated well above flood level so their contents will not be
released into flood waters and damage other property.
