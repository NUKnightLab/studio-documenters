• 2018 Carry-over discussion. The SSA Commission wants to move this to later,
since everything is already funded currently. They expressed concern over the
amount of closed storefronts and want to find a way to encourage property owners
to keep tenants in the buildings. This could be a future program. Joy advised
reaching out to 2017 contractors to make sure they have all invoiced us for services
provided, this will help the board plan how to utilize the carryover.
