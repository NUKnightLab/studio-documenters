STATE’S ATTORNEY, Anita Alvarez, submitting communication advising the
County of the Agreed Order Appointing a Transitional Administrator regarding
Jimmy Doe v. County of Cook, USDC No. 99-C-3945. This class action litigation
was originally brought in 1999 and has subsequently involved the entry of a
Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between the parties that was approved by the
District Court in December 2002 and the entry of an Agreed Supplemental Order
approved by the Court on May 18, 2006. This petition was resolved by the entry of
an Agreed Order Appointing a Transitional Administrator (TA) by the District Court
on August 14, 2007. The Board of Commissioners agreed to the entry of the
subject order during its meeting of July 31, 2007.
On June 18, 2008, the District Court entered an order amending this portion of the
TA Order permitting the Transitional Administrator to maintain the OTA funds in a
separate account to pay reasonable costs and expenses of the staff of the OTA.
The OTA account was first funded at $800,000.00 on July 22, 2008 and the
District Court entered an order for additional funding of $500,000.00 respectively
on December 18, 2008, April 14, 2009, June 30, 2009, November 17, 2009 and
April 7, 2010.
The Transitional Administrator has now presented invoice payment records
evidencing payments and a balance in the account as of July 19, 2010 in the
amount of $117,197.00 which has been reviewed and accepted by the Cook
County State’s Attorney’s Office. The TA has requested the District Court to enter
an order providing for an additional disbursement of $500,000.00 into the OTA
account which was approved by the Court on August 3, 2010.
Upon approval, the Cook County Comptroller will transfer $500,000.00 from the
Self-Insurance Fund to an account managed by the Transitional Administrator in
accordance with the terms of the aforementioned court order. From July 22, 2008
to date, inclusive of this court order, $3,800,000.00 has been transferred from the
Self-Insurance fund to the Office of the Transitional Administrator.

RICHARD NADOLNY, in the course of his employment as a Probation Officer for
the Adult Probation Department, Circuit Court of Cook County sustained accidental
injuries on January 19, 2006. While at a probationer’s home, the Petitioner fell
backwards off of an unusually large step (which was in violation of code) and fell,
and as a result he injured his lower back and leg (severe lower back and right leg
pain). The County’s exposure in this case, based on medical expenses, unpaid
TTD and permanency, totals $343,368.75. However, the Petitioner filed a third
party claim against the homeowner whose steps he fell on and recovered
$130,559.75 (Richard Nadolny v. Gregg Bornhoeft, Case No. 07-L-10111).
Because the homeowner’s insurance was inadequate, the Petitioner requested
$85,750.00 from the County to settle the Workers’ Compensation case, which
represents 25% of the County’s total exposure that would not be recoverable by the
County’s lien. However, the County negotiated this down to $24,500.00, and
includes closure of all medical, TTD and PPD exposure. Prior/pending claims:
none. State's Attorney, Anita Alvarez, is submitting Workers' Compensation
Commission Lump Sum Petition and Order No. 06-WC-42072 in the amount of
