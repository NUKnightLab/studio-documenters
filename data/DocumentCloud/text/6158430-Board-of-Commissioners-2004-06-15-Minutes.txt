WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners approves more than $400,000 a year from the

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 15, 2004

WHEREAS, sometimes County officials use paid outside lobbyists to promote positions m direct
opposition to those of the Cook County Board; and
WHEREAS, Cook County needs to present a unified front on pending state legislation; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners has oversight authority over all branches of
Cook County government and the responsibility for the prudent budgeting and management of tax
dollars; and
WHEREAS, trying to maintain a balanced budget, the Cook County Board of Commissioners should not
authorize the payment of large lobbyist contracts; and
WHEREAS, constitutionally Cook County elected officials can deploy trained County staff to monitor
pending legislation if they so choose; and
WHEREAS, a plethora of lobbyists make it impossible for the County to speak with one unified voice in

on non-government issues, any County elected official or political committee of any County elected
official while they represent the County.

OFFICE OF THE COUNTY ASSESSOR
PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT

Transmitting a Communication, dated May 24, 2004 from
JAMES M. HOULIHAN, Cook County Assessor
I am requesting that the Board of Commissioners approve an amendment to the Class 6b Classification
Ordinance that clarifies necessary document submittals and time frames relating to requests to shorten the
24-month abandonment period.
Currently, applicants seeking 6b incentives for new construction, substantial rehabilitation or the
reoccupation of property abandoned for longer than 24 months may file municipal and county letters in
lieu of enabling ordinances. This ordinance amendment seeks to provide that same procedure relating
those properties having been abandoned for less than 24 months. Applicants would still be required to
obtain approval of the necessary ordinance prior to actually receiving the benefits of the incentive.
Presently, applicants must obtain a municipal finding that "special circumstances" exist to waive the
required 24 months of abandonment and also must obtain a resolution by the Cook County Board of
Commissioners to validate that municipal finding. Unfortunately, the current language contained in the
Ordinance does not make it plain that the option of providing a "letter in lieu of' an ordinance extends to
cases involving these "special circumstances".
All applications regarding abandoned property must be made to the Assessor's Office within 90 days after
purchase of the property. Given the scheduling constraints on the relevant governing bodies, obtaining
the required resolution in 90 days is not possible at all times. Foreclosing the option of providing a "letter
in lieu of' an ordinance to those property owners who seek "special circumstances" puts them in an
untenable and unintended position.
Allowing an applicant to file a municipal or county "letter in lieu of" an enabling ordinance at the time it
made application to the Assessor became effective on January I, 2000. Although we intended that the
benefits and flexibility provided by this amendment apply in all cases, the current language contained in
the Ordinance is not clear as to the matter. This ambiguity was unintentional and the result of an
oversight in the drafting of those amendments that became effective on January I , 2000, and for this
reason this change is sought.
I have submitted a copy of proposed changes to the Ordinance, which should rectify the situation once
approved.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 15, 2004

PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT
Class 6b:

Real estate used primarily for industrial purposes, as defined herein, consisting of all newly
constructed buildings or other structures, including the land upon which they are situated; or
abandoned property, as defined herein, including the land upon which such property is
situated; or all buildings and other structures which are substantially rehabilitated to the
extent such rehabilitation has added to their value, including qualified land related to the
rehabilitation. Land qualifies when the rehabilitation adds vertical or horizontal square
footage to the improvements. The amount of land eligible for the incentive shall be in such
proportion as the square footage added by the rehabilitation bears to the total square footage
of the improvements on the parcel.
An applicant must obtain from the municipality in which the real estate is located or the
Board of Commissioners of Cook County if the real estate is located in an unincorporated
area, an ordinance or resolution expressly stating that the municipality or County Board, as
the case may be, has determined that the incentive provided by Class 6b is necessary for
development to occur on that specific real estate and that the municipality or County Board,
as the case may be, supports and consents to the Class 6b application to the Assessor. A
certified copy of the ordinance or resolution need not be filed at the time of filing the Class
6b eligibility application with the Assessor, but must be filed with the Assessor no later than
the date an assessment appeal is filed to request the class change to Class 6b. If the
resolution is not filed at the time of the eligibility application, the applicant shall instead file,
at that time, a letter from the municipality or the County, as the case may be, confim1ing that
a resolution or ordinance supporting the incentive has been requested.
A copy of the resolution or letter confirming that a resolution has been requested, whichever
is tiled with the application, will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of
the Cook County Board for distribution to the Commissioners from the affected districts.
ln the case of abandoned property, if the municipality or the Board of Commissioners, as the
case may be, finds that special circumstances justify finding that the property is "abandoned"
for purpose of Class 6b, even though it has been vacant and unused for less than 24 months,
that finding, along with the specification of the circumstances, shall be included in the
resolution or ordinance supporting and consenting to the Class 6b application. Such
resolution or ordinance shall be 4tle0 included with the eligibility application. If the
ordinance or resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the Board of
Commissioners of Cook County is required to validate such shortened period of qualifying
abandonment, and a resolution to that effect shall be included with the Class 6b eligibility
application. The applicant must obtain the municipal enabling ordinance with the required
finding of special circumstances and present such municipal ordinance to the Board of
Commissioners of Cook County prior to its determination as to whether it will validate such
a shortened period of qualifying abandonment and provide a County resolution to that effect.
A certified copy of an ordinance or resolution finding that special circumstances exist, as
well as a certified copy of a County ordinance or resolution validating the shortened period
of qualifying abandonment need not be filed at the time of filing the Class 6b eligibility
application with the Assessor, but must be filed with the Assessor no later than the date an
assessment appeal is filed to request the class change to Class 6b. If the resolution is not
filed at the time of the eligibility application, the applicant shall instead file, at that time, a
letter from the municipality or the County as the case may be, confinning that a resolution or
ordinance regarding special circumstances has been requested.

1748

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 15, 2004

This classification shall continue for a period of twelve years from the date such
new construction (excluding demolition, if any) or such substantial rehabilitation was
completed and initially assessed, or in the case of abandoned property, from the date of
substantial reoccupancy. This incentive may be renewed during the last year a property is
entitled to a 16% assessment level, if the following requirements are met:
I. the taxpayer notifies the Assessor's Office of his intent to request renewal of the
incentive from the municipality, or the Board of Commissioners of Cook County if the
real estate is located in an unincorporated area; and
2. the municipality in which the real estate is located or the Board of Commissioners of
Cook County, if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, adopts a resolution
expressly stating that the municipality or County Board, as the case may be, has
detennined that the industrial use of the property is necessary and beneficial to the local
economy, and supports and consents to renewal of the Class 6b; and
3. a copy of that resolution and a completed renewal application are filed with the Office of
the Assessor before the expiration of the 16% assessment level period.
The number of renewal periods is not limited as Jong as the property continues to apply and
qualify for Class 6b. Any property which applies for Class 6b treatment on or before the
adoption date of this ordinance change will be eligible for this renewal tenn at the end of
their original incentive period subject to the above requirements. If, on the effective date of
this Ordinance, a property is receiving Class 6b treatment, but the assessment level is higher
than 16%, that taxpayer may apply for renewal as outlined above and receive a 16%
assessment level for the prescribed period beginning after the filing and approval of the
resolution and renewal application. However, as of that effective date, the taxpayer's
assessment is higher than 16% and the taxpayer is granted a renewal of the incentive for
subsequent years, no reduction of the current assessment level based on renewal of the
incentive will be granted.
The notice of intent to request renewal which is filed with the Assessor's Office will be
forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the Cook County Board fo r
distribution to Commissioners from the affected districts.
If no renewal is obtained, the incentive shall be phased out over the next two years, pursuant
to Section 3 below. After expiration of the last incentive period, the real estate shall revert to
the applicable classification under this Ordinance.
Additionally, for newly constructed or substantially rehabilitated buildings and other
structures to qualify for Class 6b classification, an eligibility application must be made to the
Assessor within one year prior to the commencement of such new construction or substantial
rehabilitation. With respect to abandoned property, the eligibility application must be made
to the Assessor no later than ninety days after purchase for value if such property is
encompassed within the definition herein of abandoned property by reason of purchase for
value; or within one year prior to the commencement of substantial rehabilitation if such
property is encompassed within that definition by reason of substantial rehabilitation.
The Assessor may adopt rules consistent with the foregoing necessary to ensure proper
review of all factors relevant to detennine eligibility for the benefits provided under Class
6b.

1749

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 15, 2004

The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports by all Class
6b recipients as to the use of the property and the number of persons employed at the Class
6b site. Such reports shall be verified. Failure to file such reports within the time established
by the Assessor's rules shall result in loss of the incentive for the period relating to the nonfiling.

Amendment be referred to the Committee on Business and Economic Development. (Comm. No.

such Bonds shall be credited against future mandatory redemption requirements in inverse chronological
order of such payments beginning with the amount scheduled to become due at Stated Maturity, then the
amount subject to mandatory redemption in the year preceding Stated Maturity, and so on. In addition, on

Chief Financial Officer shall, purchase Bonds of such maturities in an amount not exceeding the amount

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 15, 2004

amounts of Bonds to be redeemed and, if applicable, the mandatory redemption payment so affected.
Current Interest Bonds shall be redeemed only in the principal amount of $5 ,000 each and integral
multiples thereof, and Capital Appreciation Bonds shall be redeemed only in amounts representing $5 ,000
Maturity Amount and integral multiples thereof. In the event of the redemption of less than all the Bonds
of a series of like maturity, the aggregate principal amount or Maturity Amount (as appropriate) thereof to
be redeemed shall be $5,000 or an integral multiple thereof, and the Trustee shall assign to each such
Bond of such maturity a distinctive number for each $5,000 principal amount or Maturity Amount (as
appropriate) of such Bond and shall select by Jot from the numbers so assigned as many numbers as, at
$5,000 for each number, shall equal the principal amount or Maturity Amount (as appropriate) of such
Bonds to be redeemed. The Bonds to be redeemed shall be those to which were assigned numbers so
selected; provided that only so much of the principal amount or Maturity Amount (as appropriate) of each
Bond shall be redeemed as shall equal $5,000 for each number assigned to it and so selected.
The Trustee shall promptly notify the County in writing of the Bonds or portions of Bonds
selected for redemption and, in the case of any Bond selected for partial redemption, the principal amount
thereof to be redeemed.
Unless waived by the owner of Bonds to be redeemed or as otherwise provided in an Indenture
for Variable Rate Bonds, notice of any such redemption shall be given by the Trustee on behalf of the
County by mailing the redemption notice by first class mail not less than 30 days and not more than 60
days prior to the date fixed for redemption to each registered owner of the Bond or Bonds to be redeemed
at the address shown on the Bond Register or at such other address as is furnished in writing by such
registered owners to the Trustee. All notices of redemption shall include at least the information as
follows:

the redemption date;

(2)

the redemption price;

(3)
if less than all of the Bonds of a particular series are to be redeemed, the identification
(and, in the case of partial redemption, the respective principal amounts) of the Bonds to be redeemed;
(4)
a statement that on the redemption date the redemption price will become due and
payable upon each such Bond or portion thereof called for redemption and that interest thereon shall cease
to accrue from and after said date; and
(5)
the place where such Bonds are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price,
which place of payment shall be the principal corporate trust office of the Trustee.
Such additional notice as may be agreed upon with the Depository shall also be given so long as
the Bonds are held by the Depository.
On or prior to any redemption date, the County shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of
money sufficient to pay the redemption price of all the Bonds or portions of Bonds which are to be
redeemed on that date.

1768

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 15, 2004

Notice of redemption having been given as provided therefor, the Bonds or portions of Bonds so
to be redeemed shall, on the redemption date, become due and payable at the redemption price therein
specified, and from and after such date (unless the County shall default in the payment of the redemption
price) such Bonds or portions of Bonds shall cease to bear interest. Neither the failure to mail such
redemption notice nor any defect in any notice so mailed to any particular registered owner of a Bond
shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other registered owners. Notice having been
properly given, failure of a registered owner of a Bond to receive such notice shall not be deemed to
invalidate, limit or delay the effect of the notice or the redemption action described in the notice. Such
notice may be waived in writing by a registered owner of a Bond, either before or after the event, and
such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice shall be filed with the Trustee, but
such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such
waiver. Upon surrender of such Bonds for redemption in accordance with said notice, such Bonds shall
be paid by the Trustee at the redemption price. Interest due on or prior to the redemption date shall be
payable as herein provided for payment of interest. Upon surrender for any partial redemption of any
Bond, there shall be prepared for the registered owner a new Bond or Bonds of the same Stated Maturity

With respect to any redemption of Bonds, unless moneys sufficient to pay the redemption price of
the Bonds to be redeemed shall have been received by the Trustee prior to the giving of the notice of
redemption, such notice may, at the option of the County, state that such redemption shall be conditional
upon the receipt of such moneys by the Trustee on or prior to the date fixed for redemption. If such
moneys are not received, such notice shall be of no force and effect, the Trustee shall not redeem such
Bonds, and the Trustee shall give notice, in the same manner in which the notice of redemption shall have
been given, that such moneys were not so received and that such Bonds will not be redeemed.

for redemption, in the case of Current Interest Bonds, the principal shall, until paid, bear interest from the
redemption date at the rate home by the Bond or portion of Bond so called for redemption; in the case of
Variable Rate Bonds, the principal shall, until paid, bear interest as provided in a relevant Indenture; and,
in the case of Capital Appreciation Bonds, the Compound Accreted Value at such redemption date shall
continue to accrue interest from such redemption date at the Yield to Maturity borne by such Capital
Appreciation Bond, or portion thereof, so called for redemption. All Bonds which have been redeemed
shall be cancelled and destroyed by the Trustee and shall not be reissued.

Upon the payment of the redemption price of Bonds being redeemed, each check or other transfer
of funds issued for such purpose shall bear the CUSIP number identifying, by issue and maturity, the
Bonds being redeemed with the proceeds of such check or other transfer.

or cancellation, together with indemnity, satisfactory to it. Upon the issuance of any substitute Bond, the
Trustee may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that

a timely basis to make all payments of the principal of and interest on such Variable Rate Bonds.

do, or cause to be done, all things necessary to provide for the prompt deposit with the Trustee, in
accordance with this Ordinance, of all Pledged Taxes.

time to time as the Chief Financial Officer shall detennine to be necessary or advisable, the Chief

Authorities, to abate any portion of the Pledged Taxes levied to pay principal of and interest on Variable
Rate Bonds, in the event and to the extent that the Chief Financial Officer shall determine that the
collection of such Pledged Taxes will not be necessary to provide for the timely payment of the principal
of and interest on such Variable Rate Bonds. The filing with the County Clerk of a certificate of
abatement, signed by the President and the Chief Financial Officer, shall constitute due authorization for
the County Clerk to effectuate such abatement.

SECTION 10. POWERS AS TO BONDS AND PLEDGE. The County is duly authorized to
pledge the Pledged Taxes and other moneys, securities and funds purported to be pledged by this
Ordinance in the manner and to the extent provided in this Ordinance. The Pledged Taxes and other

perform any function pertaining to its government and affairs; and
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of Cook County has adopted ordinances

welfare; and

1857

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE I 5, 2004
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of Cook County desires to amend the ordinances
governing traffic regulation for the protection of the public health, safety, comfort and
welfare by adding provisions which establish certain limitations on the use of motor driven
scooters on public ways within the County;
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED THAT:
Section 1: Definitions.
Section 2: Operation of Motor Driven Scooters Restricted.
Section 3: Exemptions.
Section 4: Applicability of this Ordinance.
Section 5: Violations.
Section 6: Effective Date.
Commissioner Daley, seconded by Commissioner Murphy moved the incorporation of the following
language: "is defined as any electric vehicle or gas driven wheeled scooter vehicle, motor-driven
cycle or other similar motor-driven vehicle." The motion carried.
The following public speakers spoke:
I.

2.
3.
4.

Richard Eddington - Chief of Police, Mount Prospect
Tom Folliard - Deputy Chief of Patrol, Cook County Sheriff's Police
Eddie McCann, Jr.- First Deputy Chief of Police, Forest Preserve District
Wally Kos - Superintendent, Highway Department
James Beligratis - State's Attorney's Office

Chainnan Hansen noted that Mount Prospect, Elgin, Des Plaines and Hoffman Estates have approved
similar ordinances.
Richard Eddington, Chief of Police, Mount Prospect, stated that motor-driven scooters need to be
regulated because of the low survivability of accidents; no helmet laws govern them. Also, they do not fit
into the existing Jllinois Vehicle Code. Mount Prospect adopted an ordinance prohibiting these scooters
from public roadways and sidewalks.
Commissioner Murphy asked whether there are specific, designated places where the scooters can be
driven, or are they altogether banned.
Chief Eddington replied that they are banned from public roadways and sidewalks.
Commissioner Steele asked whether this ordinance will only impact the unincorporated areas of Cook
County.
Chainnan Hansen noted that a boy of fourteen was killed riding a motorized scooter at the intersection of
Northwest Highway and Mount Prospect Highway.
Commissioner Maldonado asked Chief Eddington how the public has reacted to the ordinance.

1858

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 15, 2004

Chief Eddington replied that the village board encouraged a six month public education campaign, and
that there has been widespread acceptance of the ordinance in the community.
Commissioner Gonnan asked whether there is a helmet requirement under the ordinance and what the
North Suburban Chiefs Association recommended.
Most of the chiefs have adhered to or suggested a motorized scooter ban.
Commissioner Murphy asked how fast the motor scooters can travel.
Chief Eddington replied that they possibly could travel up to 60 mph in some instances.
Commissioner Butler asked whether the sale of motorized scooters was going to be made illegal.
Chief Eddington replied that this was outside of the purview of the Village of Mount Prospect. Also, it is
legal to operate motorized scooters on private property.
Commissioner Butler noted that policemen ride motor scooters.
Chief Eddington replied that they are exempt under the ordinance; there is an experimental police
program at O'Hare. In this controlled environment, such things as pot holes pose no challenge.
Chairman Hansen noted the ordinance exempts the following vehicles driven in the course of duty: police,
fire, municipal, special district, county or forest preserve. He also noted that the City of Chicago code
states the unlawfulness of persons under 16 to operate motorized vehicles not to exceed 5 brake
horsepower.
Commissioner Butler noted that the average person doesn't know about an ordinance until they violate it
and this is unfair.
Commissioner Maldonado stated that he supports the ordinance and that gang-bangers and their younger
siblings ride the scooters in his district.
Commissioner Collins stated that the state should place a ban on motorized scooters.
Commissioner Suffredin asked whether the North Suburban Chiefs Association has taken a position on
this ordinance.
Chief Eddington replied that, based on the advice of counsel, the Association has supported the ordinance.
Commissioner Suffredin asked whether any other counties have passed a similar ordinance.
Chief Eddington replied not to his knowledge.
Commissioner Sims asked whether the ordinance regulates sales to minors.
Chief Eddington replied in the negative. Instead, a six month pubic education campaign was launched
through a newsletter, cable television and media resources. This campaign was run before the Christmas
rush.

1859

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 15, 2004

Commissioner Moreno suggested that notices be put on the motor scooter boxes indicating that the
scooters cannot be used in Cook County.
Chairman Hansen asked whether there is any legal prohibition of the motor scooters under state Jaw.
Chief Eddington replied in the negative.
Chainnan Hansen asked whether there is a state allowance for the presence of motor scooters on the state
roads.
Chief Eddington replied in the negative.
Tom Folliard, Deputy Chief of Patrol, Cook County Sheriffs Police, stated that both the safety of the
motor scooter rider and of pedestrians are issues; in particular there are many complaints by senior
citizens.
Chairman Hansen asked whether these motor scooters pose a danger.
Deputy Chief Folliard, replied in the affinnative, especially on side walks.
Chainnan Hansen noted the difference between a non-motor scooter and a motor scooter, and noted that a
child does not have a sense of perspective on how to operate a motor scooter, and these motor scooters are
particularly dangerous to elderly pedestrians.
Commissioner Steele noted that in her district, adults operate motor scooters while dealing drugs.
Commissioner Daley asked whether the Sheriffs Office wi ll be issuing tickets once the ordinance is
passed and what the policy will be regarding a first offense.
Deputy Chief Folliard stated that instead of starting out with zero tolerance there should be a phased in
infonnational period and a phased in ticketing period. During the infonnational period public meetings
would be held, information would be filtered through the schools, and fl yering would be done. There
should also be a period of infonnational ticketing before punitive ticketing begins.
Chaim1an Hansen asked how long a phase-in period would be required.
Deputy Chief Folliard repl ied that three months should be sufficient.
Chainnan Hansen noted that the ordinance would have to be amended to include a phase-in period.
Commissioner Butler noted that the ordinance would not have any effect in Commissioners Sims and
Steele's districts.
Chainnan Hansen made the distinction that the policy of the City of Chicago applies to licensed vehicles,
and motor scooters are not licensed.
Commissioner Murphy asked whether the ordinance proposes confiscating motor scooters.
Deputy Chief Folliard replied in the negative, and noted that there is a fine structure under section five.
Commissioner Collins asked whether the Sheriffs Office has lobbied for state regulation.

1860

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 15, 2004

Deputy Chief Folliard replied in the negative.
First Deputy Chief of Police Eddie McCann, Jr., Forest Preserve District, Cook County stated that on
behalf of Chief Waszak, they are one hundred percent for the ordinance, especially regarding Forest
Preserve bike paths, roads and trails. The only motor driven vehicles the Forest Preserve deems
appropriate are Forest Preserve police vehicles in case of emergency. Bird watchers, horseback riders and
children are put at risk by motorized scooters.
Commissioner Steele asked whether there is any place in the Forest Preserve where motor scooters can be
operated.
First Deputy Chief of Police McCann replied in the negative; their aim is too keep the Forest Preserve as
people friendly as possible.
Commissioner Maldonado asked whether motor scooters are at present allowed on Forest Preserve
premises.
First Deputy Chief of Police McCann replied in the negative.
Commissioner Maldonado asked under what authority or ordinance are motor scooters prohibited in the
Forest Preserve.
Chainnan Hansen replied that he believes there is a Forest Preserve ordinance banning them.
Commissioner Maldonado made a distinction between the trails and the paved areas at the Forest
Preserve.
First Deputy Chief of Police McCann made the distinction that unlicensed motor vehicles cannot be
driven on Forest Preserve property.
Mr. Beligratis, State's Attorney 's Office, replied that special districts are given their own legislative
authority; this proposed ordinance covers special districts because the vehicle code does not reach special
district areas. He was uncertain whether there is a Forest Preserve code that covers unlicensed motorized
vehicles.
First Deputy Chief of Police McCann noted that the Forest Preserve District does issue tickets to motor
scooter riders who traverse the parking lots.
Commissioner Maldonado clarified that if the Forest Preserve District has no ordinance in place
prohibiting motor scooters that this be presented to the Board so that it can write the prohibition into an
ordinance.
Commissioner Suffredin noted that there is an ordinance: Section 4-1-Sa ofthe Forest Preserve Code " It
is unlawful for the operation of an automobile, motorcycle, motor scooter, or other motor vehicle to drive
upon or cause to be driven upon such motor vehicle through any woodland or upon any walk, sidewalk,
trail, path, whether marked or unmarked, within the property of the Forest Preserve District." He stated
that it went on to say, " nor upon any road or drive, or parking space within said district, except in the
manner in according to regulations prescribed by the District' s Board of Commissioners."

1861

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 15, 2004

Commissioner Suffredin asked whether there are incident reports concerning motor scooter accidents
within the last six to twelve months. He requested that First Deputy Chief of Police McCann get such
information to the Board before next week's vote on the ordinance.
Wally Kos, Superintendent, Highway Department stated that he would encourage a transitional period to
inform the municipalities and townships of the pending ordinance. He also referenced Senate Bill 2104
introduced by Senator DeLeo in October of last year. The bill was referred to the Rules Committee in the
fall and then went to the Transportation Committee and then was referred in February back to the Rules
Committee. The bill has gone nowhere, and there is not expected to be any state legislation this year.
Commissioner Gornrnn clarified the distinction between Vespas/motorcycles and motorized scooters.
Commissioner Collins asked whether the DeLeo state bill ever made it out of committee.
Superintendent Kos replied in the negative.
Commissioner Collins asked whether motor scooters were included.
Superintendent Kos replied that the definition referred to upright scooters.
Chairman Hansen asked Superintendent Kos for a copy of the bill.
Superintendent Kos agreed to supply a copy of the bill to the Chairman.
Mr. Beligratis, noted that the amendment could be amended, for example three or six months, or warnings
could be given for an initial period of time instead of actually enforcing the ordinance immediately.
Commissioner Suffredin suggested that the committee examine a Forest Preserve ordinance that was
passed last year that required bike helmets for children. A section of the ordinance contains a one year
educational period and details the education and initial enforcement.
Commissioner Murphy stated that it would be preferable to not issue tickets until a later date, but to issue
warnings effective immediately, to optim ize the public's safety.
Commissioner Daley stated that it would be necessary to include language to the effect that violations
would be waived until six months after the passage of the ordinance.
Commissioner Gonnan asked whether the Forest Preserve ordinance requires motor scooter riders to wear
helmets.
Commissioner Suffredin replied in the negative.
Commissioner Hansen asked Mr. Beligratis to go through the ordinance for the edification of the
commissioners and asked him and Commissioner Suffredin to put forward language for section six of the
ordinance relating to an educational period.
Commissioner Murphy suggested the following language: "This ordinance shall be in full force and effect
from and after its approval by the Board of Commissioners, however, citations will not be issued until six
months hence or whatever date is chosen."

1862

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 15, 2004
Mr. Beligratis suggested the following language: "It will be in full force and effect 180 days after its
approval by the Board." He stated this will circumvent the issue of not issuing citations. He cautioned
however, that it would be necessary to give adequate notice to the public that it will become enforced
beginning upon the effective date.
Commissioner Murphy made the point that the earlier the ordinance goes into effect, the earlier the public
is safe.
Chainnan Hansen stated that it might be possible to satisfy both concerns of notification and safety by
making the warning period 90 days, and somewhere in the "whereas" section mandate that law
enforcement agencies infonn all appropriate governmental units of the ordinance provisions.
Commissioner Murphy noted that Commissioner Maldonado suggested an addendum to her suggestion
that warnings be issued for an initial period; warnings would serve to educate.
Commissioner Steele suggested that the language indicate that verbal warnings will be issued, to save the
County the expense of written tickets.
Chairman Hansen suggested the following language: This ordinance shall be in full force and effect 90
days after its approval by the Board of Commissioners. From the date of approval for 90 days warnings
shall be issued by Jaw enforcement entities.
Commissioner Daley noted that the Deputy Chief of Patrol from the Sheriff's Office indicated that 6
months would be required.
Commissioner Murphy stated that she prefers a written warning, even something pre-printed, to a verbal
warning; preferably one that indicates that the second time they are stopped or after a given date they will
receive a ticket.
Chainnan Hansen noted some Forest Preserve language submitted by Commissioner Suffredin, which
includes "enforcement shall begin on." He noted that there should be an educational period of six
months. He stated that the language for section six should be made available to the Board at the time of
proceedings on June 15th.
Commissioner Daley asked for a definition under Section 1.
Commissioner Hansen suggested that the meeting be continued until next Tuesday when the committee
meets again and at that point pass the ordinance with amendments to Sections I and 6.
Commissioner Gorman asked whether Vespas and mopeds need to be exempted.
Chainnan Hansen replied in the negative.
Mr. Beligratis noted that licensed vehicles are not allowed on sidewalks.
Commissioner Gorman asked whether all municipalities are covered.
Mr. Beligratis replied in the affinnative, unless they pass their own ordinances.
Commissioner Murphy asked whether a municipality could pass an ordinance not to adopt Cook County's
ordinance.

1863

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 15, 2004

Mr. Beligratis replied in the positive.
Commissioner Butler noted that the law could become confusing between municipalities.
Commissioner Collins asked who has j urisdiction, municipalities or the County.
Mr. Beligratis replied the municipalities have jurisdiction; however if there is no local ordinance, the
County ' s would apply; the ordinance would apply in unincorporated Cook County and in special districts.
Chainnan Hansen asked for an answer on this question by the next meeting.
Commissioner Butler asked what effect the ordinance would have on the City of Chicago.
Mr. Beligratis stated that the City of Chicago passed Ordinance Number 356020 which allows anyone age
sixteen and over to operate motorized scooters; thi s ordinance takes precedence over the County's
ordinance.
Chainnan Hansen stated that with regards to police powers, according to Home Rule powers, municipal
ordinances supercede the County's unless there is special legi slation; the County's Home Rule powers
cannot even supercede a municipality that is not home ruled.
Commissioner Steele, seconded by Commissioner Murphy, moved to defer Communication No.
265630. The motion carried.
Commissioner Steele moved to adjourn. Seconded by Commissioner Butler, the motion carried
and the meeting was adjourned.
