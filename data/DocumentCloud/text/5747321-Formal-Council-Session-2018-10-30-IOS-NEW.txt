and process for the Board of Review to act in accordance with MCL 211.7u.

This year, the: Board of Review will be required to be- in "compliance with the settlement
agreementientered into with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). The application has
been reviewed and approved by the ACLU and [the law department prior to submissionito
this honbrable body. This document contains a point-by-point review of the application
detailing that all aspects of the agreement were met.

The application was based on a collaborative effort with the Coalition to End

document that you have attached to this packet is the final approved document prior to

SUMMARY

Each year the Board of Review is required by state law to establish a new process and
guidelines in reviewing and determining property tax exemptions by reason of poverty in
accordance with MCL 211.7u. This portion of the General Property Tax Act was created to
allow homeowners who own and occupy their real residential property as a primary
homestead the opportunity to be exempt of property taxes in whole or in part when the
property owner is unable to contribute to the public charges as long as they have met the
required guidelines established by the local governing unit and the application approved by
the Board. of Review and adopted by City, Council by resolution in accordance with MCL
211.7u.

The Board of Review remains closely engaged in the current matters faced by many
homeowners challenged with property tax delinquency and/ or at risk of foreclosure. The
Board. of Review continues ?to-raid the community in considering these challenges when
possible to help, homeowners maintain their ownership within the- City of Detroit by
providing a connected and unified relationship with the Office of the Assessor, City of Detroit
Treasury, Wayne County Treasurer and other community based agencies and organizations
in order to assist as many homeowners as possible under law.

Therefore, we are presenting to this Honorable Body the 2019 Homeowners Preperty Tax
AssistanceProgram Guidelines and Application in accordance with MCL 211.7u.

GOVERNOR LANSING STATE TREASURER

Bulletin 16 0f2018
October 22, 2018
Changes for 2019

T0: Assessing Officers and County Equalization Directors
FROM: State Tax Commission
SUBJECT: Procedural Changes for the 2019 Assessment Year

The purpose of this Bulletin to provide information on statutory changes or procedural changes
for the 2019 assessment year.

A. In?ation Rate Used in the 2019 Capped Value Formula

The in?ation rate, expressed as a multiplier, to be used in the 2019 Capped Value Formula is
1.024.

The 2019 Capped Value Formula is as follows:

2019 CAPPED VALUE (2018 Taxable Value LOSSES) 1.024 ADDITIONS

The formula above does not include 1.05. because the in?ation rate multiplier of 1.024 is
lower than 1.05.

B. Federal Poverty Guidelines Used in the Determination of Poverty
Exemptions for 2019

MCL 211.7u, which deals with poverty exemptions, was signi?cantly altered by PA 390 of
1994 and was further amended by PA 620 of 2002.

Local governing bodies are required to adopt guidelines that set income levels for their
poverty exemption guidelines and those income levels shall not be set lower by a city or
township than the federal poverty guidelines updated annually by the US. Department of
Health and Human Services. This means, for example, that the income level for a household
of 3 persons shall not be set lower than $20,780 which is the amount shown on the following
chart for a family of 3 persons. The income level for a family of 3 persons may be set higher
than $20,780. Following are the federal poverty guidelines for use in setting poverty
exemption guidelines for 2019 assessments:

Size of Family Unit Poverty Guidelines
1 $12,140

2 $16,460

3 $20,780

4 $25,100

5 $29,420

6 $33,740

7 $3 8.060

8 80

For each additional person $4,320

 

 

 

Note: PA 390 of 1994 states that the poverty exemption guidelines established by the
governing body of the local assessing unit Ml also include an asset level test. An asset test
means the amount of cash, ?xed assets or other property that could be used, or converted to
cash for use in the payment. of property taxes. The asset test should calculate a maximum
amount permitted and all other assets above that amount should be considered as available.
Please see STC Bulletin 6 of 2017 for more information on poverty exemptions.

Note: PA. 135 of 2012 changed the requirements for ?ling documentation in support of a
poverty exemption to allow an af?davit (Treasury Form 4988) to be ?led for all persons
residing in the residence who were not required to ?le federal or state income tax returns in
the current year or in the immediately preceding year. This does include the owner of the
property who is ?ling for the exemption.

Multipliers for the Valuation of Free?Standing Communication Towers

The State Tax Commission recommends that, subject to the quali?cations stated below,
communication towers should be valued for the 2019 assessment year using the table of
historical (original cost when the tower was new) cost valuatibn multipliers set forth in the
multiplier table below. These multipliers have been developed in a manner such that they
account for the typical depreciation which is expected for a tower of the indicated age and
also account for changes in the cost of the tower and erecting it that have occurred since the
time the tower was constructed. On this basis, the multiplier table which is shown below is
intended to predict the current true cash value of a tower of the vintage year in which the
tower was constructed. An important component in determining the current value of a tower
built in a given year is the change in the cost of materials, particularly changes in the cost of
steel, between .the time of construction and the current tax day. Since the table considers both
depreciation and changes in construction costs, and since changes in construction cost have
not always occurred at a constant rate, the multiplier table does not always evidence a decline
in the rate by which the historical cost must be adjusted in order to determine current value.
This effect is expected and can be better understood if one remembers that the multiplier
table is not a depreciation table and the multipliers are applied to the historic cost of
construction, not to the current replacement cost.

Communication towers are real property. When a communication tower is built on land
owned by the owner of the tower, the tower is valued and assessed as a real property
improvement to the land on which it is located. When a communication tower is built on
leased land, the owner is required to report the original construction cost of the tower on
Section of its personal property statement, in the same way that it would report any other
structure on leased land. Although the construction costs are reported on the personal

Page 3

property statement, a 't0wer on leased land is not assessed on the personal property
assessment 'roll. Instead, the assessor is required to establish 5 separate {real property
assessment for a tower located on leased land, using the procedures set forth in State Tax
Commission Bulletin 8 of 2002 and State Tax Commission Bulletin 1 of 2003.

Please note: Sometimes communication towers are located on land that is exempt because the
land is owned by an exempt entity such as a muniCipality or is otherwise exempt. When this
occurs, the tower must be assessed to the tower owner on the real property roll as a structure
on leased land. IN ADDITION, the assessor must also consider whether the land should also
be assessed to the tower owner as provided by MCL 211.181.

There may be situations where the value of a particular freestanding communication tower is
more or less than the ?gure developed by using this table. This could be due to unusual
depreciation (physical deterioration and/or obsolescence) or an unusual enhancement in value
cansed by supply and demand factors in a particular area.

Property Statement for Communication Towers (Form 3594) is to?be used for reporting the
costs of freestanding communication towers. This form was developed for the speci?c
purpose of gathering construction cost information for communication towers. The assessor
may use this Form to gather detailed information regarding the construction costs of
communication toWers. This cost information can then be used as a basis For valuation by
multiplying the historic cost by the appropriate multiplier from the table located below.

Please note the following:

The preferred method for valuing freestanding communication towers is using
original cost new multiplied by the appropriate multiplier from the following table.

0 In some cases historical/original cost may be unobtainable. Those cases may require
using the Assessor?s, Manual cost new multiplied by the ASSessor.?s Manual
depreciation table multiplier.

0 Do not apply the Assessor?s Manual depreciation table multipliers to the
historical/original cost of a tower.

Do not apply the communication tower multipliers from the following table to the
Manual cost new of a tower.

Form 3594 is a real property statement and, as such, the taxpayer is not required to complete
and submit the form to the assessor unless the taxpayer is specifically asked to do so. If a
communication tower is located on leaSed land, the owner should already be reporting its
original acquisition costs on Section of the personal property statement (Form 632 (L-
4175)). If so, the assessor would only need to send Form 3594 if more detailed information
regarding costs is needed. The assessor IS NOT REQUIRED TO SEND Form 3594 to tower
owners each year. The following table applies to both guyed and self-supporting
communication towers.

D. Sales Studies

Equalization study dates are as follows for 2019 equalization:

Two Year Study: April 1, two years prior through March 31, current year
Single Year Study: October 1, preceding year through September 30, current year

For 2018 studies for 2019 equalization the dates are as follOws:

Two Year Study: April 1, 2016 through March 31, 2018
Single Year Study: October 1, 2017 through September 30, 2018

Note that the time period revisions apply to all equalization studies, that is: sales ratio
studies, land value studies and economic condition factor studies for appraisals. Also note
that the revised time period for two year studies applies to all real property classifications.

Please be advised that the above sale study dates are not the same as the valuation date used
in appeals before the Michigan Tax Tribunal. Evidence presented in a Tax Tribunal appeal
should reflect the value of the property as of tax day (December 31). This means that sales

 

Page 5

occurring after March 31, 2018 and September 30, 2018< should still be considered and
included when submitting evidence in a Tax Tribunal appeal involving the 2019 tax year:

. Property Classi?cation

The State Tax Commission reminds assessors that classi?cation 18 to be determined annually
and 18 based upon the use of the property and not highest and best use of the property. The
Commission is aware that some assessors are still classifying property according to highest
and best use and/or are {not classifying property on an annual basis. The Commission asks
that all assessors take the necessary steps to ensure that all real and personal property is
properly classi?ed according to MCL 211.340.

Updated Assessors Manual

The State Tax Commission at their February 14,2017 adopted the new Assessors Manuals
and approved their required use for the 2019 year. While the printed manual did not change
from prior versions of the manual, the way CAMA software providers obtain the updated
costs in the manual did change. This has caused some confusion regarding some items in the
manual including the County Multiplier. The State Tax Commission will continue to
annuall'y receive from Marshall Swift and annually approve County Multipliers. Because of
the electronic connection to the manual, those multipliers are included in the costs the CAMA
providers electronically retrieve. Therefore, assessors will no longer be required to add a
separate County Multiplier. 

Staff continue to work with Marshall Swift and CAMA software providers on issues related
to tracking of costs between the printed and electronic manual. Updates will be provided via
listserv once a ?nal solution is reached.

. Updated Recommended Classi?cation Codes

At the February 13, 2018 State Tax Commission meeting, the Commission adopted CAMA
Data Standards, which included updated property classi?cation codes. As a result of the
Commission?s prior action, the State Tax Commission at their meeting on April 9, 2018
rescinded the State Tax Commission Recommended Classi?cation Codes ad0pted on April
21, 2011 and approved for use by assessors revised Recommended Classi?cation Codes.
The updated State Tax Commission Recommended Classi?cation Codes are available online
at 

. Tax Tribunal Small Claims Division Hearings

Assessors should carefully read all notices, orders and other correspondence sent by the Tax
Tribunal. Assessors should pay special attention to the Notice of Hearing and ensure they are
available at the date and time of the scheduled hearing. It is important to appear at the
hearing and to timely ?le with the Tax Tribunal and serve a copy to the taxpayer of all
evidence and documentation you wish to be considered at the hearing.

Assessors representing their local unit in Tax Tribunal hearings need to submit evidence to
support the value of the property under appeal. If the assessor is relying on the property
record card as evidence of value, the property record card must be for the year(s) being
appealed. The complete property record card, including all calculations should be provided;
do not submit a property record card that states ?calculations too long? and then fail to

Page 6

include the additional calculations. Also, it is important to submit the studies prepared that
support the economic condition factor and land value on the record. card. Assessors should
also be able to explain at the Tax Tribunal hearing how the value shown on the property
record card was calculated. More information regarding the Michigan Tax Tribunal,
including Tribunal Rules, forms and instructions is available at 

I. Changes to, Personal Property Tax

On May?3,?20?18 Governor Snyder signed in law PA. 132 of 2018. This act made changes to
the Small Business Taxpayer Exemption (MCL 211.90), speci?cally changing the ?ling
requirements to provide that eligible taxpayers do not have to annually ?le to receive the
exemption. Taxpayers who ?led for the exemption in prior years still must ?le Form 5076,
Small Business Property Tax Exemption Claim Under MCL 211.90, in 2019 to claim the
exemption. Once granted, the assessor will then continue the exempt the personal property
until the taxpayer ?les a rescission indicating they no longer qualify for the exemption.
Assessors can implement an audit program to determine if taxpayers still qualify for the
exemption.

As a reminder, Public Acts 261?264 of 2017 were signed into law on December 28,2017.
These Acts made several changes that affect both the Small Business Taxpayer Exemption
and the Eligible Manufacturing Personal Property Exemption (EMPP).

P.A. 2610f 2017 changes the deadline for ?ling the Small Business Taxpayer Exemption to
February 20 and changed Form 5076 from an Af?davit to a Statement. This allows the
assessor to accept either a facsimile or electronic signature on Form 5076. Form 5076 has
been updated to re?ect these statutory changes.

P.A. 261-264 of 2017 also changed the statute to allow assessors to accept a postmark by
February 20 for Form 5278 to claim the EMPP exemption. Form 5278 and. Form 632
(Personal Property Statement) have been updated to re?ect these statutory changes.

'Finally, P.A. 261-264 of 2017 changed the appeal procedure for both the Small Business
Taxpayer Exemption and" the EMPP exemption. Taxpayers who miss the ?ling deadline for
either exemption may ?le a late application directly with the March Board of Review. The
March Board of Review should grant the exemption as long as the taxpayer otherwise
quali?es for the exemption. Both the Assessors Guide to the Small Business Taxpayer
Exemption and the Assessors Guide to EMPP and BSA have been updated to re?ect these
statutory changes.

The updated Guide to the Small Business Taxpayer Exemption and Assessors Guide to
EMPP and BSA are available online at

J. Principal Residence Exemption

Public Act 133 of 2018 was signed into law on May 3, 2018. The Act amended the General
Property Tax Act to remove a requirement that a property must be unoccupied in order for an
individual who resides in a nursing home or assisted living facility to continue to claim a
principal residence exemption (PRE) on the property. It also allows the exemption to
continue for a situation in which the individual is residing in ?any other location,? as long as
the individual is residing there solely for purposes of convalescence. Convalescence is a state
of recovering from a disease, operation, or injury. A convalescent is a person in that state. A
convalescent may choose to be cared for at home or a relative?s home rather than in a nursing
home or assisted living center. For example, a person who has just had a stroke and who is
recovering and rehabilitating at a relative?s home is an example of a convalescent.

More information can be found on the PRE website at Treasury
staff is available to assist and answer questions regarding this Act or other PRE?related

questions. The following are key contacts:

K. Omitted or Incorrectly Reported Property (MCL 211.154)

The State Tax Commission at their meeting on November 28, 2017 approved revised
Omitted or Incorrectly Reported Property MCL 211.154 Forms. The prior form versions will
no longer be accepted. Please be advised if the old forms are submitted, they will be returned

and will need to be resubmitted.

Questions can be directed to the staff at Additional
information, including Bulletin 2 of 2018 and copies of the approved forms are available
online at 540eti1ions.

L. Residential Solar Panels

The State Tax Commission at their meeting on February 13, 2018 rescinded their prior
guidance on the treatment of solar panels on residential real properties and determined that
solar panels on a parcel classi?ed as residential real property shall be assessed as a
component of the real property. Assessors are advised to review and utilize the New
Assessors Manual to cost residential solar panels as a component of the residential real
property improvements. This determination is limited to solar panels on real property
classi?ed under MCL 211.34c as residential real property only. The staff memorandum to
the State Tax Commission is available online at 

M. Authority of July and December Boards of Review

The State Tax Commission has become aware of a signi?cant number of instances where
Boards of Review are acting outside their statutory authorities. MCL 211.53b speci?es: The
board of review meeting in July and December shall meet only for the purpose described in
subsection (1) (Quali?ed Errors) and to hear appeals provided for in sections 7u (PoVerty
Exemption), 7cc (Principal Residence Exemption), 7ee (Quali?ed Agricultural Exemption),
7jj (Quali?ed Forest Exemption), and 90 (Small Business Taxpayer Exemption).

Assessors should carefully review the Board of Review FAQ on the Commission?s website
to ensure their Boards of Review are acting within their statutory authorities.

STATE OF MICHIGAN
RICK SNYDER DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY NICK A. KHOURI
GOVERNOR LANSING STATE TREASURER
Bulletin 691' 2017
June 6, 2017
Poverty Exemption
TO: Assessors and Equalization Directors
FROM: State Tax Commission

SUBJECT: Exemption of Principal Residence by Reason of Poverty
Bulletin 5 of 1995, Bulletin 7 of 2010 and Bulletin 5 of 2012 are rescinded.

MCL 211.7u provides for a property tax exemption, in whole or part, for the principal residence
of persons who, by reason of poverty, are unable to contribute to the public charges. Principal
residence is de?ned in MCL 211.7dd as a principal residence or quali?ed agricultural property.
MCL 211.7u(1) states that this section does not apply to property of a corporation. EVen if a
corporation or a limited liability company meets the de?nition of a principal residence or a
quali?ed agricultural property, it is not be eligible to receive a poverty exemption.

Local Unit Responsibilities:

MCL 211.7u requires local units to annually adopt a policy, including an asset test, used to
approve" or deny poverty exemptions.

First, local units must annually adopt guidelines which specify the total household income which
will be used to approve or deny poverty exemptions. Statute requires that the income levels shall
not be set lower than the federal poverty guidelines updated annually by the US. Department of
Health and Human Services and published by the State Tax Commission in their annual
Procedural Changes Bulletin.

According to the US Census Bureau, ?income? includes, but is not limited to:

0 Money, wages, salaries before deductions, regular contributions from persons not living
in the residence

I Net receipts from non-farm or farm self-employment (receipts from a person?s own
business, professional enterprise, or partnership, after business expense deductions)

I Regular payments from social security, railroad retirement, unemployment, worker?s
compensation, veteran?s payments, public assistance, supplemental security income (SSI)

- Alimony, child support, military family allotments

0 Private and governmental retirement and disability pensions, regular insurance, annuity
payments

PO BOX 30471 . LANSING. MICHIGAN 48909-7971
- (517) 335-3429

Bulletin 6 of 2017
Page 2

- College or university scholarships, grants, fellowships, assistantships
I. Dividends, interest, and net income from rentals, royalties, estates, trusts, gambling or
lottery winnings

Second, the local unit policy must include an asset test. The purpose of an asset test is to
determine the reSOUrces available: cash, ?xed assets -or other property that could be converted to
caSh and used to pay property taxes in the year the poverty exemption is ?led. The local unit
should require that claimants provide a list of all assets when applying for a poverty exemption.
Following is a list of assets that may be included in the annual guidelines.

A second home, land, vehicles

Recreational vehicles such as campers, motor-homes, boats and 

Buildings other than the residence

Jewelry, antiques, artworks

Equipment, other personal property of value

II Bank accounts (over a speci?ed amount), stocks

0 Money received from the sale of property, such as, stocks, bonds, a house or car (unlessa
person is in the speci?c business of selling such property)

II ,Withdrawals of bank deposits and borrowed money

0 Gifts, loans, lump-sum inheritances and one-time insurance payments

0 Food or housing received in lieu of wages and the value of food and fuel produced and
consumed on farms

0 Federal non-cash bene?ts programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps and school

lunches 

The Michigan Tax Tribunal in Robert Taylor Sherman Twp, Docket No. 236230 ruled that the
asset test does not include the value of the principal residence. Additionally, the Michigan Court
of Appeals in Ferrero Township of Walton, No. 30222] ruled that the homestead property tax
credit is not to be considered income for poverty exemption purposes.

The local unit policy may provide for an applicant to own possessions in addition to the principal
residence and still receive a poverty exemption. Examples may include. bill are not limited to:

0 Additional vehicles

Ir More land than a minimum ?footprint? for the home

0 Equipment or other personal property of value, including recreational vehicles (campers,
motor homes, boats, etc.)

0 Bank account(s) (a maximum amount should be speci?ed)

Third, MCL 211-711(1) allows for partial poverty exemptions to be granted. A partial poverty
exemption is an exemption of a percentage of the taxable value of the principal residence rather
than the entire taxable value. The local unit can limit poverty exemptions to partial exemptions
or to minimum or maximum exemption of their choosing. The State Tax Commission
recommends that local governing bodies include within their annual guidelines, language and
criteria for granting partial exemptions and/or minimum or maximum exemptions.

Bulletin 6 of 2017
Page 3

Finally, the State Tax Commission recommends that local units develop an application to be
used by claimants and a written policy that details the process. To? assist local governing bodies,
the State Tax Commission has developed a sample application and resolution. See attached.

Taxpayer Filing Requirements:

In order to receive a poverty exemption, a taxpayer must annually ?le a completed application
form and all required additional documentation, with the supervisor, assessor, or the Board of
Review where the property is located. The application form may- be obtained from the local unit
where the prOperty is located and may be submitted on or after January 1 but before the day prior
to the last day of the December Board of Review during the year in which the exemption is
requested.

To ensure an application is received'in time to be heard by a Board of Review, the State Tax
Commission recommends the claimant contact, the local governing unit directly to verify
deadline dates for submission of an application.

In addition to annually ?ling the application, in order to be eligible for the poverty exemption, a
taxpayer must do all of the following:

1. Own and occupy the prinCipal residence.

2. Provide federal and state income tax returns for the current or immediately preceding
year, including any property tax credits, for all persons residing in the principal
residence (disclosure of the income of an owner who is not residing in the principal
residence is not required). An alternative af?davit may be ?led for all persons
residing in the residence who were not required to ?le federal or state income tax
returns in the current or immediately preceding year. (See Form 4988, Poverty

Bulletin 6 of 2017
Page 4

Board of Review Responsibilities:

MCL 211.7u(l) indicates: The principal residence of persons who, in the judgment of the
supervisor and board of review, by reason of poverty, are unable to contributexto the public
charges is eligible for exemption in whole or part from taxation under this act.

The State Tax Commission has determined that the supervisor shall make a recommendation
regarding the claimant? petition and the Board of Review shall consider, review and then
approve or deny the exemption request.

Additionally, MCL in part: The Board of Review shall follow the policy and
guidelines of the local assessing unit in granting or denying an exemption under this section.

When reviewing an application, the Board of Review should consider all information available to
them at that time. They should consider all documentation originally submitted by the taxpayer
and any additional relevant information that is available to the Board of Review.

The Board of Review can deviate from the adopted policy and guidelines of the local unit 
when there are ?substantial and compelling reasons why there should be a deviation from the
policy and guidelines.? If the Board of Review deviates from the adopted policy and guidelines,
they are required by statute to communicate the substantial and compelling reasons for the
deviation from the guidelines in writing to the taxpayer.

Appeal Rights:

A property owner or assessor may appeal a decision of the March Board of Review by
completing and submitting a petition to the Michigan Tax Tribunal no later than July 31 of the
same year. A property owner or assessor may appeal a decision of the July or December Board
of Review by completing and submitting a petition to the Michigan Tax Tribunal within 35 days
of the July or December Board of Review?s denial of the poverty exemption.

An application for poverty exemption, for a speci?c principal residence, may only be acted upon
by the Board of Review once a year. If an application is denied at the March Board of Review, it
may not be reheard by the July or December Board of Review during the same calendar year.
The taxpayer must ?le an appeal of the March Board of Review determination to the Michigan
Tax Tribunal. Similarly, if an application is denied at the July Board of Review, the December
Board cannot rehear that application, the taxpayer must ?le an appeal to the Michigan Tax
Tribunal.

A person who ?les a claim for poverty exemption is not prohibited from also appealing the
assessment on the same property in the same year.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

1. Background

On June 24, 2013, the U. S. District
Court for the Eastern District of
Tennessee entered a criminal judgment
against William Ralph Kincaid pursuant
to his guilty plea. Kincaid pled guilty to
a felony under the i-?DiaC Act. namely
receiving in interstate commerce a
misbranded drug with intent to defraud
or mislead, in violation of sections
301(0) and of the Act [21
U.S.C. 331(c) and 333(a)(2)) and 18
U.S.C. 2. The basis for this conviction

was Kincaid's admission that he
obtained drugs from Quality Specialty
Products (QSP). a foreign company, for
use at East Tennessee Hematology-
Oncology Associates, PLC. (McLeod
Cancer). These drugs, were not FDA
approved and were misbranded in that
they adequate directions for use
and were manufactured in an
establishment that was not registered
with FDA and that did not list with FDA
the drug products it manufactured;
From approximately September 2007 to
early 2008 and from August 2009 to
February 2012. McLeod Cancer
purchased more than $2 million in
mishranded unapproved drugs for use at
McLeod Cancer. Additionally, Kincaid?
and McLeod Cancer billed Medicare].
TennCare; and other government health
benefit programs approximately $2.5
million for these unapproved drugs.

Mcaid is subject to debarment based
on a finding, under section 306(a)(2) of
the Act [21 U.S.C. that
he was convicted of a felony under
Federal law for conduct relating to the
regulation of a drug product under the
Act. By the letter dated May 20,
2015, FDA notified Kincaid of a
proposal to permanently debar him from
providing services in any capacity to a
person having an approved or pending
drug product application. The proposal
also offered Kincaid an opportunity to
request a hearing. providing him 30
days from the date of receipt of the letter
in which to file the request and 80 days
from the date of receipt of the letter to
support that recuest with information
sufficient to justify a hearing. In a letter
dated June 17, 2015, Kincaid requested
a hearing and indicated that the
information justifying the hearing
would be forthcoming. More than 60
days have passed from the date Kincaid
received letter. and Kincaid has
not filed any additional information to
support his request.

Under the authority delegated to him
by the Commissioner of Food and
Drugs. the Director of the Office of
Scientific Integrity (OSI) has considered
Kincaid?s request for a hearing. Hearings
will not be granted on issues of policy
or law, on more allegations. denials. or
general descriptions of positions and
contentions. or on data and information
insufficient to justify the factual
determination urged [see 21 CFR
21.24fb)).

Because Kincaid has not presented
any information to support his hearing
request. 05! concludes that Kincaid
failed to raise a genuine and substantial
issue of fact requiring a hearing.
Therefore. OSI denies Kincaid's request
for a hearing.

II. Findings and Order

Therefore, 081, under section
of the Act and under the
authority delegated. finds that William
Ralph Kincaid has been convicted ofa
felony under Federal law for conduct
relating to the regulation of a drug
product under the Act.

As a result of the foregoing findings,
William Ralph Kincaid is permanently
debar'red from providing services in any
capacity to a person with an approved
or pending drug product application
under section 505, 512. or 802 of the
Act [21 U.S.C. 355, 360b, or 382),
or under section 351 of the Public
Health Service Act [42 U.S.C. 262),
effective [see DATES) ,(21 U.S.C.
and and 21
U.S.C. 321(dd)). Any person with an
approved or pending drug product
application Who knowingly uses the
serviCes of Kincaid, in any capacity
during his period of debarment, will be
subject to civil money penalties. See
section of the Act (21
U.S.C. If Kincaid. during his
period of debarment, provides services
in any capacity to a person with an
approved or pending drug product
application. he will be subject to civil
money penalties. See section 
of the Act [21 U.S.C. 
In addition. FDA will not accept or
review any abbreviated new drug
applications submitted by or with the
assistance of Kincaid during his period
of debarment.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background

Section 873(2) of the Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1981 (42
U.S.C. 9902(2)) requires the Secretary of
the Department of Health and Human
Services to update the poverty
guidelines at least annually, adjusting
them on the basis of the Consumer Price
Index for All Urban Consumers 
The poverty guidelines are used as an
eligibility criterion by Medicaid and a
number of other Federal programs. The

poverty guidelines issued here are a
simplified version of the poverty
thresholds that the Census Bureau uses
to prepare its estimates of the number of
indiViduals and families in poverty.

As required by law, this update is
accomplished by increasing the latest
published Census Bureau poverty
thresholds by the relevant percentage
change in the Consumer Price Index for
All Urban Consumers The
guidelines in this 2018 notice re?ect the
2.1 percent price increase between
calendar years 2016 and 2017. After this
inflation adjustment, the guidelines are
rounded and adjusted to standardize the
differences between family sizes. In rare
circumstances, the rounding and
standardizing adjustments in the
formula result in small decreases in the
poverty guidelines for some household
sizes even when the in?ation, factor is
not negative. In cases where the year?to-
year change in in?ation is not negative
and the rounding and standardizing
adjustments in the formula result in
reductions to the guidelines from the
previous year for some household sizes,
the guidelines for the affected
household sizes are fixed at the prior
year?s guidelines. As in prior years,
these 2018 guidelines are roughly equal
to the poverty thresholds for calendar
year 2017 which the Census Bureau
expects to publish in final form in
September 2018?.

The poverty guidelines continue to be
derived from the Census Bureau?s
current official poverty thresholds; they
are not derived from the Census
Bureau?s Supplemental Poverty Measure
(8PM).

The following guideline figures
represent annual income.

Separate poverty guideline figures for
Alaska and Hawaii re?ect Office of
Economic Opportunity administrative
practice beginning in the 1966?1970
period. [Note that the Census Bureau
poverty thresholds?the version of the
poverty measure used for statistical
purposes?have never had separate
figures for Alaska and Hawaii.) The
poverty guidelines are not defined for
Puerto Rico or other outlying
jurisdictions. In cases in which a
Federal program using the poverty
guidelines serves any of those
jurisdictions, the Federal office that
administers the program is generally
responsible for deciding whether to use
the contiguous-states-and-DC guidelines
for those jurisdictions or to follow some
other pr?oceduie.

Due to confusing legislative language
dating back to 1972, the poverty
guidelines sometimes have been
mistakenly referred to as the 
(Office of Management and Budget)
poverty guidelines or poverty line. In
fact, OMB has never issued the
guidelines; the guidelines are issued
each year by the Department of Health
and Human Services. The poverty
guidelines may be formally referenced
as ?the poverty guidelines updated
periodically in the Federal Register by

2644

Federal Register/Vol. 83, No. 12/ Thursday, January 18, 2018/ Notices

 

the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services under the authority of
42 U.S.C. 

Some federal programs use a
percentage multiple of the guidelines
(for example, 125 percent or 185 percent
of the guidelines], as noted in relevant
authorizing legislation or program
regulations. Non-Federal organizations
that use the poverty guidelines under
their own authority in non-Federally-
funded activities also may choose to use
a percentage multiple of the guidelines.

The poverty guidelines do not make a
distinction between farm and non-farm
families, or between aged and non-aged
units. (Only the Census Bureau poverty
thresholds have separate figures for aged
and non?aged one-person and two-
person units.) .

Note that this notice does not provide
definitions of such terms as ?income? or
?family,? because there is considerable
variation in defining these terms among
the different programs that use the
guidelines. These variations are
traceable to the different laws and
regulations that govern the various
programs. This means that questions
such as ?Is income counted before or
after taxes??, "Should a particular type
of inCome be countedl'j?, and "Should a
particular person be counted as a .
member of the familylhousehold?? are
actually questions about how a specific
program applies the poverty guidelines.
All such questions about how a specific
program applies the guidelines should
be directed to the entity that administers
or funds the program, since that entity
has the rasponsibility for defining such
terms as ?income" or "faintly,? to the
extent that these terms are not already
defined for the program in legislation or
regulations.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

1. Background

Section 484 of the Tariff Act of 1930,
as amended (19 U.S.C. 1484).
establishes the requirement for
importers of record to make entry for
merchandise to be imported into the
customs territory of the United States.
Customs entry information is used by
U.S. Customs and Border Protection
(CBP) and Partner Government Agencies
(PGAs) to determine whether
merchandise may be released from CBP
custody. Importers of record are also
obligated to complete the entry by filing
an entry summary declaring the value,
classification, rate of duty applicable to
the merchandise and such other
information as is necessary for CBP to
properly assess duties. collect accurate
statistics and determine whether any
other applicable requirement of law is
met.

The customs entry requirements were
amended by Title VI of the North
American Free Trade Agreement
Implementation Act (Pub. L. 1034182,
107 Slitl. 2057, December 8, 1993),
commonly known as the Customs
Modernization Act, or Mod Act. In
particular, section 637 of the Mod Act
amended section 484(a)(1)(A) of the

Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C.
1484(a)(1)(A)) by revising the
requirement to make and complete
customs entry by submitting
documentation to CBP to allow, in the
alternative, the electronic transmission
of such entry information pursuant to a
CBP-authorized electronic data
interchange (EDI) system. CBP created
the Automated Commercial System
(AC8) to track, control, and process all
commercial goods imported into the
United States. CBP established the
specific requirements and procedures
for the electronic filing of entry and
entry summary data for imported
merchandise through the Automated
Broker Interface (AB1) to ACS.

II. Transition Into the Automated
Commercial Environment

In an effort to modernize the business
processes essential to securing U.S.
borders, facilitating the ?ow of
legitimate shipments. and targeting
illicit goods pursuant to the Mod Act
and the Security and Accountability for
Every Port Act of 2006 (Pub. L.
109?347, 120 Stat. 1884), CBP
developed the Automated Commercial
Environment (ACE) to eventually
replace ACS as the CBP-authorized EDI
system. Over the last several years, CBP
has tested ACE and provided significant
public outreach to ensure that the trade
community is fully aware of the
transition from AC8 to ACE.

On October 13, 2015, CBP published
an Interim Final Rule in the Federal
Register (80 FR 61278) that designated
ACE as a CBP-authorized EDI system.
The designation of ACE as a CBP-
authorized EDI system was effective
November 1, 2015. In the Interim Final
Rule, CBP stated that ACS would be
phased out and anticipated that ACS
would no longer be supported for entry
and entry summary filing. Filers were
encouraged to adjust their business
practices so that they would be prepared
when ACS was decommissioned.

CBP developed a staggered transition
strategy for decommissioning ACS. The
phases of the transition were announced
in several Federal Register notices. See
81 FR 10264 (February 29, 2016); 81 FR
30320 (May '16, 2016); 81 FR 32339
(May 23, 2018); 82 FR 38924 (August 18,
2017); and 82 FR 51852 (November 8,
2017). This notice announces another
transition as the processing of electronic
drawback filings under parts 181 and
191 of title 19 of the Code of Federal
Regulations (CFR) is transitioning into
ACE.
