NOTICE OF PUBLIC HEARING

A public hearing will be held by the Detroit City Planning Commission in the Committee of the
Whole Room, 13th Floor, Coleman A. Young Municipal Center, 2 Woodward Avenue, Detroit,
Michigan 48226, on

THURSDAY, JANUARY 31.. 2019 AT 5:15 PM

to consider the request of Mr. JaJuan Thomas to amend Article XVII, District Map No. 77 of the
1984 Detroit City Code, Chapter 61, Zoning, by showing a B4 (General Business District)
zoning classi?cation where an R1 (Single-family Residential District) zoning classi?cation
currently exists on one (1) parcel, commonly identi?ed as 1620 Westwood Avenue.

The location of the proposed rezoning is speci?cally indicated as the shaded area on the
accompanying map.

The proposed map amendment is being requested to allow for the establishment of a ?Store of a
generally recognized retail nature whose primary business is the sale of new merchandise? at

1620, 1610 and 1 I600 Westwood Avenue. The proposed retail use would be permitted on a
by-right in the proposed B4 zoning classi?cation.

The pertinent zoning district classi?cations are described as follows:
R1 Single-family Residential District

This district is designed to protect and preserve quiet, low-density residential areas now
primarily developed and those areas which will be deveIOped with single-family detached
dwellings and characterized by a high ratio of home ownership. The regulations for this
district are designed to stabilize and protect the essential characteristics of the district and
to promote and encourage a suitable environment for activities associated with family life.
To these ends, development is limited to a relatively low concentration and uses permitted
by right are limited to single?family detached dwellings which provide homes for the
residents of the area. Additional residential uses such as religious institutions,
neighborhood centers, and utility uses necessary to serve the immediate area may be
permitted on a conditional basis.

B4 General Business District

The B4 General Business District provides for business and commercial uses of a
thoroughfare-oriented nature. In addition to these uses, other businesses, which may bene?t
by drawing part of their clientele ?'om passing traf?c are permitted. Additional uses, which
may be successfully blended with permitted by-right uses, are conditional.

A Zoning Ordinance map amendment requires approval of the City Council after a public hearing
and after receipt of a report and recommendation by the City Planning Commission. This Zoning
Ordinance map amendment request is being considered consistent with the provisions of Article
111, Division 3 of Chapter 6] of the 1984 Detroit City Code, the Detroit Zoning Ordinance.

You may present your views on this proposal by attending this hearing, by authorizing others to
represent you, or by writing to this office prior to the hearing; 2 Woodward Avenue, Room 208,
Detroit, Michigan 48226 (FAX: 313-224-4336). Because it is possible that some who are affected
