 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 18, 2001

Commissioner Hansen asked the total cost of the project.
Michael LaMont stated that the total budget for the project is $1.7 million.
Commissioner Sutker asked what were the deficiencies in the water supply system?
Michael LaMont stated that the deficient areas are the pump supply system and the e lectrical power at the
Halsted Street Pumping Station where there is only a single source of electrical supply. He further
commented that the proposed professional services contract includes the installation of a backup
generator.
Chairman Carr asked Michael Wong, representative of A lvord, Burdick & Howson, L.L.C. to add to
Michael LaMont's statements.
Michael Wong, stated that the current water supply system does not meet current regulations as they
relate to venting requirements, overflow, and tank repairs. Additionally, there is tank painting and some
items that pertain to the pump faci lities which are functional but need to be brought up to current
regulations. Mr. Wong concluded by saying that some of the pumps need to be brought up to current
regulations.
Commissioner Sutker asked when did the !EPA issue its report?
Michael Wong responded that he was not certain but believes it was earlier this year which is the reason
the request for a proposal was developed.

246727.

358 1

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 18, 200 I

Michael LaMont stated that the $20,000.00 request is to prepare an annual inspection report for all the
buildings located in the City of Chicago which is required by the City of Chicago's Building Ordinance.
The inspection is a visual inspection on the exterior facade of the buildings. He said the Office of Capital
Planning and Policy decided not to include this request in Communication 246727 because the annual
inspection goes beyond the County Building. Once the C hicago Building Department issues its report,
the Office of Capital Planning and Policy will be notified of any exterior repairs required. The Office of
Capital Planning and Policy will then come before the County Board requesting to hire a contractor. Each
facility will be handled on a case by case basis. Mr. LaMont further stated that a critical inspection was
performed last year on the County Building and based on that report, the Office of Capital Planning and
Policy is aski ng for permission to prepare speci ficati ons to renovate the entire building.

Commissioner Hansen, seconded by Vice Chairman Butler, moved the approval of Communication
No. 246726. The motion carried.

replacement of the windows in the County Building.
Michael LaMont stated that plans are for the consultant to make an assessment of what needs to be
replaced. He said the infonnation would be given to the Office of Capital Planning and Policy with
options on the window replacement project. He also stated that the $14 million budget would not cover
replacement of all windows.

the expected completion date of Summer 2002.
Commissioner Hansen asked what is the completion date for the work being done at the Rockwell
Warehouse?
Michae l LaMont stated that the project is also behind schedule because it needed to be rebid. Mr.

* Referred to the Committee on Finance Tax Delinquency on 9/20/01.
Fredda Berman, Director of Real Estate Services, stated on the City of Blue Island PIN number 24-362 10-014, there are delinquent taxes, but there are no forfeited delinquent taxes. Only forfeited taxes can
be purchased over the co unter. There had been a previous tax sale on this parcel and there are taxes
delinquent and there is a possibility that this parcel will be listed on the upcoming scavenger list. She
indicated th is item could be approved pending its appearance o n the scavenger list, which s hould be
coming o ut in the next month or so.
Ms. Berman indicated that the packet included other parcels owned by the third party requestor however,
the parce l that the City of Blue Is land is req uesting is 24-36-2 10-01 4.
Pam Fraizer, C ity C lerk for Blue Island, indicated when the appli cation was made for the person that had
to list the other properties they own in Cook County. There are delinquent taxes on this property, 24-362 10-0 14. She indi cated the building is falling apart and there is a develo per in place.
Ms. Berman indicated that PI N 24-36-2 10-01 4 has been researched and there was a previous tax sale to
Phoeni x Bond that was vacated. The refunds from vacating the sale she does not know whether the PIN
will be on the scavenger list. T he list is being prepared by the Department of Revenue and the
T reasurer's Office.
Commissioner Schumann noted that the next step would be to request the Treasurer' s O ffi ce and the
Department of Revenue speed up the process so PIN 24-36-2 10-01 4 can appear on the scavenger list so
the Vi llage of Blue Island can ask.
Chairm an Sims asked Assistant State' s Attorney Michael Prinzi, to add ress the s ubcommittee on this
item .
ASA Prinzi indicated a tax delinquent list is put together by the Treasurer' s Office and the Departm ent of
Revenue and a cut-off time is created. He suspected if a commissio ner was to ask the T reasurer to look at
this particular PIN, she would be accepting.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 18, 200 I

Commissioner Goslin asked what would cause a court to vacate a purchase of taxes?
City Clerk Fraizer responded that she had spoken to the company that bought the back taxes and, when
they looked at the building and because it is stickered Unfit for Occupancy, a Sale in Error was issued.
Chairman Sims asked if there has been due diligence done on this PIN 24-36-2 10-014?
Ms. Berman answered affirmatively that the research has been completed.
In response to an inquiry by Commissioner Goslin, City C lerk Frazier responded that the urgency is
because of the deterioration of the parcel. It is hazardous to the City and it is in a residential area.
Portions of the roof have fallen as well as evidence of graffiti on the property. She noted if this is

WHEREAS, the month of October is recognized as Breast Cancer Awareness Month; and
WHEREAS, in the United States, an estimated 192,200 new invasive cases of breast cancer are expected
to occur among women during the year 200 I and about 1,5 00 new cases of breast cancer are expected to

options; and
WHEREAS, the American Cancer Society recommends that women age 40 and older have an annual
mammogram and annual c linical breast examination by a healthcare professional, and perform monthly
breast self-examination.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and the Members of the Board of
