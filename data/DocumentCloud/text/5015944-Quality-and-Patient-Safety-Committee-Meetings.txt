 What is Safety Culture?
“Safety culture is the sum of what an organization is and
does in pursuit of safety.
Safety culture is the product of individual and group beliefs,
values, attitudes, perceptions, competencies, and patterns
of behavior that determines the organization's commitment
to quality and patient safety.”

 “Hospitals are complex environments that depend on strong leadership to support an
integrated patient safety system that includes the following:
Safety culture
Validated methods to improve processes and systems
Standardized ways for interdisciplinary teams to communicate and collaborate
Safely integrated technologies
In an integrated patient safety system, staff and leaders work together to eliminate
complacency, promote collective mindfulness, treat each other with respect and
compassion, and learn from patient safety events, including close calls and other
system failures that have not yet led to patient harm.”

Joint Commission Standard

 



Leaders create and maintain a culture of safetv and qualitv throughout the hospital.

Rationale:

Safety.r and gualitv thrive in an environment that supports teamwork and respect for other people, regardless of their position
in the hospital. Leaders demonstrate their commitment to qualitv and set expectations for those who work in the hospital.
Leaders evaluate the culture on a regular basis.

Leaders encourage teamwork and create structures, processes. and programs that allow this positive culture to ?ourish.
Disruptive behavior that intimidates others and affects morale or staff turnover can be harmful to patient care. Leaders must
address disruptive behavior of individuals working at all levels of the hospital, including management. clinical and
administrative staffr licensed independent practitioners, and governing bodv members.

Elements of Performance:

DESCRIPTION MOS I: DOC 5C ESP

1 Leaders regularlv evaluate the culture of safetv and gualitv using valid and A
reliable tools.

[.21

Leaders prioritize and implement changes identified bv the evaluation. A

3 Leaders provide opportunities for all individuals who work in the hospital to .5.
participate in safety,r and qualitv initiatives.

The essential role of leadership in developing a safety culture

In any health care organization, leadership?s first priority is to be accountable
for effective care while protecting the safety of patients, employees, and
visitors. Competent and thoughtful leaders* contribute to improvements in
safety and organizational They understand that systemic flaws exist
and each step in a care process has the potential for failure simply because
humans make mistakes.ELS James Reason compared these flaws latent
hazards and weaknesses to holes in Swiss cheese. These latent hazards
and weaknesses must be identified and solutions found to prevent errors from
reaching the patient and causing harm"? Examples of latent hazards and
weaknesses include poor design, lack of supervision, and manufacturing or
maintenance defects.

The Joint Commission's Sentinel Event Database reveals that leadership's
failure to create an effective safety culture is a contributing factor to many
types of adverse events from wrong site surgery to delays in treatment.i

In addition, through the results of its safety initiatives, The Joint Commission
Center for Transforming Healthcare has found inadequate safety culture to be
a signi?cant contributing factor to adverse outcomes. Inadequate leadership
can contribute to adverse events in various ways, including but not limited to
these examples:
- Insuf?cient support of patient safety event reportingB
- Lack of feedback or response to staff and others who report safety
vulnerabilities?
- Allowing intimidation of staff who report events9
- Refusing to consistently prioritize and implement safety
recommendations

Leadership dot the Culture of Safety 8.24.2018

 

Cultures of safety result from the effective interplay of three
organizational elements:
(1) environmental structures and processes within the organization,
(2) the attitudes and perceptions of workers, and
(3) the safety-related behaviors of individuals.

Cooper, 2000

12

Page 26 of 55

Leadership and the Culture of Safety 8.24.2018

 1. “The top creates culture - they will change the
culture, inevitably.”
2. “What will really, in the end, create humble
leadership is the recognition by the people in
the[se] roles that they do need the help of their
direct reports and their teammates and others.”
3. “The word ‘leadership’ itself should die…. It’s not
about leadership. It’s about a much subtler
differentiated set of things that the people are
doing that we end up calling ‘teamwork,’ but
teamwork is also too vague.”
4. “Power is lack of humility.”

 Leadership Behaviors – What Leaders Do
1. Person-centeredness – Be consistently person-centered in
word and deed
2. Front Line Engagement – Be a regular authentic presence at
the front line and a visible champion of improvement
3. Relentless Focus – Remain focused on the vision and strategy
4. Transparency – Require transparency about results, progress,
aims and defects.
5. Boundarilessness – Encourage and practice systems thinking
and collaboration across boundaries.

 Psychological Safety: Individuals’ perceptions about the
consequences of interpersonal risks in their work environment.
These perceptions include taken-for-granted beliefs about acceptable
interactions with co-workers, superiors, and subordinates, and how
others will respond when one puts oneself on the line, such as by
asking a question, seeking feedback, reporting a mistake, or
proposing a new idea.
