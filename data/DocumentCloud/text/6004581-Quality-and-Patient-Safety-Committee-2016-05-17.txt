III.

Report from Chief Quality Officer
A. Regulatory and Accreditation Updates
B. Metrics (Attachment #1)
Dr. Krishna Das, Chief Quality Officer, reviewed the metrics and provided an update on regulatory and
accreditation matters. The Leapfrog Score was recently published. Stroger Hospital had a grade of B at the end
of last year; it now has a grade of C. The Leapfrog Score is a very complex score that incorporates some
process of care and outcome measures; the administration fills out a survey for this, and there are some tests for
the computerized provider order entry, as well.

III.

Report from Chief Quality Officer (continued)
Last year, Stroger Hospital had a variety of process of care measures, which were the surgical care improvement
measures - these basically relate to treatments given to patients who undergo surgery. That measure was
sunsetted by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) at the end of last year. Stroger Hospital
had outstanding performance in that measure, and that was a big part of the Leapfrog Score. This year, that
measure was removed and the CMS measure for patient satisfaction was incorporated. Nothing else really
changed, just that one substitution. The other big driver within Leapfrog is the Patient Safety Index, which
involves data relating to a variety of surgical complications; after reviewing the surgical complications from last
year, the administration discovered that the complications were largely not preventable.
Director Lerner requested that the Committee receive an update on the subject of the Operating Room Process
Improvement Project sometime in the near future, perhaps in September.
With regard to the metrics, Director Marsh inquired whether the targets and variances are compared to only the
previous month, March, and not to the quarter. Dr. Das responded affirmatively. However, she stated that the
last slide in the presentation is the Board report; in that slide, the data is compared to the most recent full
quarter. Director Marsh stated that it is misleading to have the targets and variances based on one month of
data; this should be based, at a minimum, on quarterly data.

VII. Recommendations, Discussion / Information Item
A.

Strategic planning discussion
Topic: Clinical Research, presented by Dr. William Trick, Director, Collaborative Research Unit,
Department of Medicine (Attachment #4)

Dr. John Jay Shannon, Chief Executive Officer, provided an introduction to the presentation. He also
introduced Richard Sewell, Associate Dean of Community and Public Health Practice at UIC School of Public
Health, who will be moderating the strategic planning discussions.
Dr. Trick reviewed the presentation, which included information on the following subjects:
•

•
•

Research challenges within CCHHS
Recommended strategies

During the discussion of slide 25 of the presentation, which referenced a project funded by the Chicago
Community Trust, Director Richardson-Lowry stated for the record that she is a Board Member of that
organization.
Director Marsh noted that the organization needs to be thoughtful about its direction in relation to research;
CCHHS has a different mandate than Northwestern, Rush or UIC; those organizations do not have to juggle
with their budget in the way that CCHHS must. She added that they also have a different fundraising structure.
If the decision is made to make the investment, then it should be for the big investment to support this, rather
than doing it in a partial fashion. She posed the question of - how can we safely protect our mandate from the
Cook County Board and Cook County citizens and engage in research that is going to benefit that very same
community? Dr. Claudia Fegan, Executive Medical Director/Medical Director-Stroger, provided comments in
response. She stated that the opportunity to do research draws people here. Whether CCHHS has the
horsepower to go at this full-tilt is dependent on a number of factors; the inclination is to go there, but the
organization has to be successful clinically in order to continue to do that.

VII. Recommendations, Discussion / Information Item
A.

Strategic planning discussion (continued)

In response to a question regarding what other constraints beyond budgetary exist in terms of being able to
invest in this type of infrastructure, Dr. Shannon stated that some constraints include those involving handling
of money, hiring of staff and procurement; most of it has to do with the timeliness and efficiency with which it
is all completed.

VIII. Adjourn
As the agenda was exhausted, Chairman Gugenheim declared the meeting

 COOK COUNTY HEALTH AND HOSPITALS SYSTEM
BOARD OF DIRECTORS
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
Sponsored by
M. HILL HAMMOCK, CHAIR, THE HONORABLE JERRY BUTLER, VICE CHAIR,
RIC ESTRADA, ADA MARY GUGENHEIM, EMILIE N. JUNGE,
WAYNE M. LERNER, DPH, MARY B. RICHARDSON-LOWRY,
CARMEN VELASQUEZ AND DORENE P. WIESE, EdD, DIRECTORS
WHEREAS in December of 2014, Dr. Erica E. Marsh was appointed by the President of the Cook County
Board of Commissioners, and confirmed by the Board of Commissioners, to serve as a member of the Board
of Directors of the Cook County Health and Hospitals System; and
WHEREAS, Dr. Marsh played an integral role in the governance of the Health System, which demands a
considerable time commitment from its volunteer Board members; and
WHEREAS, Dr. Marsh graciously lent her vast expertise to the Health System by serving as a member of
the Health System Board’s Quality and Patient Safety Committee from December 2014 through May 2016;
and
WHEREAS, while serving on the Health System Board of Directors, Dr. Marsh was a part of the leadership
team that grew CountyCare membership to more than 160,000 and established a network of providers that
adds to CCHHS’s current sites and consists of all of the Federally Qualified Health Centers in Cook County
and nearly every hospital, including the five academic medical centers. With more than 130 access points,
this extensive network allows CountyCare members the ability to access care close to their home and within
a network of care utilized by their primary care provider. CountyCare has achieved considerable success
providing an unprecedented opportunity for low income adult residents of Cook County to have access to
care. Because of CountyCare and the Affordable Care Act, for the first time in the Health System’s history,
there are more insured patients than uninsured; and
WHEREAS during her tenure with the Health System, Dr. Marsh earned the genuine respect of her fellow
Board members for her keen insight, attention to detail, and knowledge in the areas of medicine and
research; and
WHEREAS the Health System’s leadership team held Dr. Marsh in high regard and appreciated her
strength and support, as well as her ability to lead with integrity and objectivity.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Directors of the Cook County Health and
Hospitals System, on behalf of the more than five million residents of Cook County served by the Health
System, does hereby gratefully acknowledge Dr. Marsh for her extraordinary abilities, outstanding
leadership and unwavering commitment to the transformation of the Health System in order to maximize
access to quality medical care to all residents of Cook County.

 Ethical Research
~ Subjects should not be selected due to privilege or
Emanuel, JAMA, 2000
vulnerability
CCHHS IRB

• Advocates for vulnerable subjects (e.g., detainees, HIV+, impaired
decisional capacity)
• Appropriate, but not coercive, compensation
• Promotes inclusion of Spanish speakers
• Jail and mental health representatives protect such populations
• No recent suspension of activities

28

Page 52 of 56

 Research challenges within CCHHS
• Research timelines require responsive entity
– Rapid hiring, part-time & temporary workers, and no
hiring freezes
– Purchasing of supplies critical

• Fiscal intermediary
– Difficult for system to receive funds directly and
efficiently allow PIs to expend funds
• Lost indirect cost capture

• Provision for CCHHS staff time dedicated to research
29

Page 53 of 56

 Recommended strategies
• Develop CCHHS dept. of research to support:
– Pre-grant (application & biostatistics)
– Post-grant (biostatistics, IRB, accounting, reporting)
– Research compliance

• Develop capacity to receive, use and track funds
in dedicated departmental research budget lines
• Employment process to hire into time sensitive
positions (e.g. research assistants)
• Supply chain/purchasing solution
30

Page 54 of 56

 Recommended strategies
• Pursue extramural funding for innovative care
delivery solutions (HRSA, CMS)
• Develop Innovations Center
– Improve translation of research to provision &
evaluation of high quality, safe, efficient care
• For CCHHS as a provider & CountyCare population
