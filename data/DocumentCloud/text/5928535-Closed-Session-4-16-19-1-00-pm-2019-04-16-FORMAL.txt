RE: Detroit Renewable Power Closure

 

A resident of District 5 reached out to our office regarding concerns with the recent Detroit Renewable
Power (DRP) closure. I am requesting that the appropriate respective departments please answer the
following:

1. ?Will all of the municipal solid waste (MSW) and refused derived fuel (RDF) house floors be
shredded, processed, and cleaned/disinfected?

2. ?Does DRP have a rodent remediation plan in place? The facility is surrounded by residential

communities that rodents from the facility may migrate to.?

?Will GDRRA still be housed on site??

4. ?What are the plans for the site? Ideally, it would be a great location for parking
structures/facilities for the newly constructed Wayne County Judicial Complex.?
