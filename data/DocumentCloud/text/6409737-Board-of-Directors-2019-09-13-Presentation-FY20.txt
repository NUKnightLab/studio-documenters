 Bad Debt Is On The Rise Locally

Feel like the hospital is
shaking you down over that
bill? It probably is.
By Brigid Sweeney March 24, 2017

Even as the number of
Americans without health
insurance is at a record low,
Chicago hospitals are wrestling
with a metastasizing problem:
bad debt.

 FY2020 Success Factors
The FY2020 budget proposal aligns with the recently approved CCH strategic plan, IMPACT 2023,
however, success will depend on:
•

The ability to meet the uncompensated care demand. Growth in uncompensated care is
unsustainable with current revenues. Public Charge rule may further impact uncompensated
care.

•

Partnerships with labor, working on efficiencies and process improvements, and patientcentered focus

•

Entering into strategic partnerships with other providers to drive volume, expand access and
enhance quality

•

Stability of state and federal programs including the 340B prescription drug program,
Affordable Care Act and Medicaid including DSH (Disproportionate Share Hospital)

•

Implementing identified revenue cycle improvements based on best practices

•

Modest Medicaid membership growth and stable Medicaid rates

•

CountyCare members’ use of CCH services

•

Adapting to the dynamic larger healthcare environment
