GENERAL BACKGROUND
As part of the Capital Maintenance Program, the Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) solicited
bids for general contractors to perform capital maintenance work for Building 12 at Bridgeport
Homes (IL2-004). The work is to be performed in the four (4) units at the following addresses:
3140 S. Green St., 3144 S. Green St., 3146 S. Green St. and 3150 S. Green St. The interior Scope
of Work includes the creation of one (1) new ADA accessible unit. To create this unit the bottom
floors of two (2) side-by-side duplex row houses will be joined together into a single street level
unit. The upper levels of the row houses will also be joined together to provide a single “flatstyle” unit. All units will receive new kitchens, bathrooms and mechanical, electrical and
plumbing upgrades. In all of the units, the existing drywall will be patched and painted and the
light fixtures, tub surrounds, range hoods, and selected doors will be replaced. On the outside,
selected shrubbery will be removed or replaced and designated concrete landings and patios will
be replaced. Concrete walks and ramps will be installed and brick infill work performed. In
addition, selected windows, sills and doors will be upgraded.
PROCUREMENT HISTORY
The CHA advertised Invitation for Bid (IFB) No. 10 – 00604 on September 20, 2010 for capital
maintenance work needed in and around Building 12 (Group 3) at Bridgeport Homes. The IFB
was advertised in the Chicago Sun-Times, the Chicago Defender, El Dia, on the CHA website
and on BuySpeed Online.
The Pre-bid meeting and Site Visit were held on September 24, 2010. The CHA issued
Addendum No. 1 on October 13, 2010. It changed the bid submittal date from October 14, 2010
to October 22, 2010. Addendum No. 2 was issued October 15, 2010 to answer Requests for
Information, and distributed selected revised and new drawings and technical specification
sections, and release updated BF pages.
The CHA received and opened five (5) bids on October 22, 2010.
After reviewing the bid submittal materials, the Department of Procurement and Contracts and
the Capital Construction Department held a pre-award survey meeting with Oakley Construction
Co., Inc., the apparent low bidder. The firm responded to questions on the thoroughness of its
bid, the amount of the work it planned to self-perform, and its capacity to perform this work. The
firm’s proposed project team was reviewed and its projection of a longer lead-time for several
materials was discussed. In addition, the Compliance Officer gave an overview of new
compliance procedures.
