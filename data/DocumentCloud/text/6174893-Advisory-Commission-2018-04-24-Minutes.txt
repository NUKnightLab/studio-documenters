i.
Zapwater Communications appears to have the most experience working with
global clients and therefor understands and seeks to work with diverse
clients/communities. They also appear to have a very metrics and outcome-driven
approach. Additionally their proposal seemed to be the most creative and already
includes new ideas for ways to market Uptown.

Ripson Communications has good experience with other chambers of commerce,
especially with promoting their events. The porposal seemed to lack new ideas and
creativity with new marketing strategies, and instead sticks with more traiditonal
public relations approaches.
iii.
Wisecarver Public Relations has promoted events for Andersonville and The
Magnificent Mile. There seems to be a lack of experience with promoting entire
meighborhoods. They also seem to know the least about Uptown and its key
issues.
iv.
Tuohy commenetd that Ripson has done a fantastic job of promoting events in
other neighborhoods, and those events have become so well know thoughout the
region. She also asked how goals will be measured.
v.
Sorge commented that Zapwater Communciations seemed to be very clear with
the metrics that they will use to define success in their proposal.
vi.
Keeney commented that Zapwater’s proposal seemed very exciting and the right
fit for Uptown which needs to market itself more creatively than other
neighborhoods.
Motion to accept proposal by Zapwater Communications for PR services.

Second: Cheng
