• May or may not impact the final decision
• Board’s decision to determine if urban sprawl impacts are
relevant

5-7

 FPA MODIFICATIONS
FPA Boundary and Prescription Modifications

• Must be approved by NOACA’s Board of Directors
• 53 FPA approved modifications since 2009
• 42% for new development

• Seven (7) policies (Chapter 4)
• Ensure consistency with 208 Plan principles

Environmental or economic impacts related to urban sprawl
Development vs. non-development impact of modifications
Regional impacts (impacts beyond the modified FPAs)
Planning documents (community master plans, watershed action
plans, balanced growth plans, etc.)

Local Jurisdictions Can Apply More Stringent Wastewater
Treatment Criteria with the Prescriptions for Wastewater

 GEAUGA COUNTY
• Limits sanitary sewer extensions
• Parcel-level planning
• County imposed requirements prior to
NOACA review:

• Approval by the Board of Commissioners
• Approval of the township(s) Board of
Trustees

• NOACA policy only requires townships
be notified and provided an opportunity
to comment on FPA modifications
5-7

 WAYNE COUNTY
• Under NEFCO’s 208 Plan and
modification policies
• FPA utilized to help preserve rural
character
• Two primary techniques:

• Limit FPA boundaries to incorporated
limits – Marshallville
• Limit future sewer connections (orange) to
small areas adjacent to existing sewers
(yellow) – Orrville and Dalton

5-7

 NEW 208 PLAN
Focus Group Relevant FPA Policy Recommendations

• FPA boundary modifications supported by local, regional or
watershed planning efforts preferred (community master plans,
watershed action plans, balanced growth plans, etc.)
• 5-year sewer extension timeframe (coincides with NOACA staff 5year countywide FPA reviews)
• NOACA can consider local undue harm against probable net
benefits of the FPA modification request
• Included an urban sprawl question in the wastewater decision
makers questionnaire

Urban Sprawl FPA Policy Discussion Takeaways

•

5-7

Region has excess wastewater capacity
Reduce “infrastructure sprawl”
Short-term vs. long-term costs
Policy requires approval by Ohio EPA & USEPA
Policy must be defensible
Investigate an asset management component to a proposed
policy

 DISCUSSION
Potential Questions to Guide Staff Review:
• Is the proposed FPA modification within an Urbanized Area?
• Is the proposed FPA modification to serve proposed or
anticipated new development?
• What type of land use(s) are within the proposed new
development (e.g. residential, commercial, industrial, mixed?)
• What is the number of units or buildings proposed?
• What is current system capacity (conveyance and treatment)?
5-7

 DISCUSSION
Potential Questions to Guide Staff Review (continued):
• How much new sanitary sewer infrastructure will be
constructed (linear feet of sanitary sewer line, new pump
stations, force main, etc.)?
• Is the proposed development supported by a comprehensive
plan (e.g. community master plan, area plan, balanced growth
plan, watershed action plan, etc.)?
• What are the long-term (20-year) maintenance costs?
• Is the proposed FPA modification part of an asset
management plan?
5-7

 NOACA staff will:

NEXT STEPS

• Continue to review the urban sprawl FPA policy issue; and
• Develop potential criteria and structure for an urban sprawl
FPA policy

5-7

 NOACA will STRENGTHEN regional
cohesion, PRESERVE existing
infrastructure, and BUILD a
sustainable multimodal transportation
system to SUPPORT economic
development and ENHANCE quality
of life in Northeast Ohio.
