APPLICATION NUMBER: 19-6337
ADDRESS: 1500 SEMINOLE STREET
HISTORIC DISTRICT: INDIAN VILLAGE
APPLICANT: STEVEN MANKOUCHE
STAFF SITE VISIT: 07-16-2019

PREPARED BY: A. PHILLIPS

PROPOSAL
The building located at 1500 Seminole Street is a 2½-story single-family residence constructed in 1909. The structure
is finished with stucco with wood half-timbering and carved wood detailing. The house is surrounded by elaborately
landscaped spaces at the front and both side yards. The front of the property (back to the setback line of the house) is
enclosed by a series of regularly occurring (approximately every 11’) stucco pillars with lengths of black wroughtiron-type fencing between them. At the rear of the property, the fencing changes to a monolithic concrete and stucco
garden wall.

With the current proposal, the applicant is seeking the Commission’s approval to implement landscape
modifications per the attached drawings. Included in the proposal are the following scope items:

 •
•

•

Overall modification of existing landscape plan including the addition of some new plants and the relocation
of existing plants and landscape elements.
Addition of the following physical objects/structures to the landscape:
o Small decorative person gate
o Water feature
o Gazebo
o Arbors
o Pergola
o Trellises
o Garden storage shed
Replacement of existing concrete and stucco garden wall caps and coping to match existing simple and
rectilinear profile

STAFF OBSERVATIONS
•

•

The existing hedge of arborvitae dividing the front yard from the back yard is mature and well-established. It provides a
dense screen from the right-of-way and prevents visibility of the backyard from the street and sidewalk.
The drawings indicate modifications to the front steps of the house, however, this modification is not mentioned in the
written proposal.

ELEMENTS OF DESIGN

(1) Height. Virtually all of the houses in the district have two (2) full stories plus attic or finished third floor within the roof;
these are generally called "two-and-a-half" story houses. Additions to existing buildings shall be related to the existing
structure; new buildings shall meet the following standards:
(i) The eight (8) adjoining houses on the same face, excluding any houses built since 1930, churches, schools and
commercial structures, shall be used to determine an average height. If eight (8) houses are not available on the
same block face, then one or more houses as close as possible to being directly across the street from the proposed
structure may be used. On Jefferson Avenue, the five (5) existing houses shall be used. The height of the two (2)
adjoining houses shall be added into the total twice, with a divisor of ten (10) (seven (7) on Jefferson Avenue) used
to determine the average. Any new building must have a height of the main roof of at least eighty (80) per cent of
the resulting average; in no case shall a new building be taller than the tallest roof height included in the
computation. In determining the height of existing structures and proposed structures, the highest point of the main

 roof shall be used, even where towers, cupolas, or other minor elements may be higher.
(ii) The level of the eaves of a proposed new structure having as much or more significance for compatibility as the
room height, an average eave or cornice height shall be determined by the same process as that described above.
The proposed new structure shall have a height at the eaves, or cornice, of not less than ninety (90) per cent of the
average determined from existing structures, and in no case shall the eaves or cornice of the proposed structure be
lower than the lowest eave or cornice height used in the computation, nor higher than the highest.
(2) Proportion of buildings' front facades. Proportion varies in the district, depending on age, style, and location in a specific
subdivision. Height being established by the standards above, proportion will be established by permitting no proposed
building or addition to create a front facade wider or narrower than those existing on the same block.
(3) Proportion of openings within the facade. Window openings are virtually always taller than wide; several windows are
sometimes grouped into a combination wider than tall. Window openings are always subdivided, the most common window
type being guillotine sash, whose area are generally further subdivided by muntins. Facades have approximately fifteen (15)
per cent to thirty-five (35) per cent of their area glazed: Sunporches with a very high proportion of glass subdivided by
mullions and muntins are common.
(4) Rhythm of solids to voids in front facades. In buildings derived from classical precedents, voids are usually arranged in a
symmetrical and evenly-spaced manner within the facade. In examples of other styles, especially those of neo-Tudor and
Victorian substyles, voids are arranged with more freedom, but usually is a balanced composition.
(5) Rhythm of spacing of buildings on streets. The spacing of the buildings is generally determined by the setback from the
side lot lines; these tend to be consistent, even though lot width may vary. Because of the existence of several subdivisions
and their related subdivision and deed restrictions, the placement of buildings on lots varies from area to area in the district.
In the case of very wide properties, two (2) conditions exist. A very wide site may have a house placed centrally upon it,
with extensive side yard space; this occurs only with extremely large houses by district standards. A more typical placement
of houses of avenge size for the district is at the side of the wide site, placed normally in relation to one of the adjoining
houses. The rest of the property is a side yard on the other side of the house, and the entrance is often oriented toward that
side yard.
(6) Rhythm of entrance and/or porch projections. In those examples of classical inspiration, entrances and porches, if any,
tend to be centered on the front facade. Other examples display more freedom with entrance and porch placement, with
some having the main entrance at the side. Porches, often permanently enclosed sun porches, are often placed at the side of
the building.
(7) Relationship of materials. The majority of the buildings are faced with brick, while many are partially or totally stucco.
There are some stone buildings; clapboard is rare, and almost never the sole material. Wood shingle is occasionally used as
a wall covering, usually at the second floor level, and never as the sole material. Roofing includes slate, tile, and wooden
and asphalt shingles. Stone trim is common. Wood is almost universally used for window frames and other functional trim,
and is used in many examples for all trim. Because of the existence of several subdivisions and their related deed
restrictions, the exterior textures and materials may vary from block to block in the district.
(8) Relationship of textures. The most common relationship of textures in the district is that of the low-relief pattern of mortar
joints in brick contrasted to the smooth surface of wood or stone trim. The use of stucco or concrete, with or without halftimbering, as a contrast to brick surfaces is not unusual. Tile, slate, or wood shingle roofs have particular textural values
where they exist. Asphalt shingles, generally, have little textural interest, even in those types which purport to imitate some
other variety.
(9) Relationship of colors. Natural brick colors (red, yellow, brown, buff) predominate in wall surfaces. Natural stone colors
also exist. Where stucco or concrete exists, it is usually left in its natural state, or painted in a shade of cream. Roofs are in
natural colors (tile and slate colors, wood colors) and asphalt shingles are predominantly within this same dark color range.
Paint colors often relate to style. The classically inspired buildings, particularly neo-Georgian, generally have woodwork
painted white, cream or in the range of those colors, including "putty." Doors and shutters are frequently dark green or
black. Colors known to have been in use on buildings of this type in the eighteenth or early nineteenth centuries on similar
buildings may be considered for suitability. Buildings of Medieval inspiration (notably neo-Tudor) generally have painted
woodwork and window frames of dark brown or cream color. Half-timbering is almost always stained dark brown. Queen
Anne or late Victorian examples may have several paint colors on a single facade. These tend to be dark in tone and
frequently of the "earth tone" family. The original colors of any house, as determined by professional analysis, are always
acceptable for that house, and may provide suggestions for similar houses.
(10) Relationship of architectural details. These generally relate to style. Neo-Georgian buildings display classic details, mostly
in wood, and sometime in stone. Areas commonly, but not always, treated are porches, shutters, window frames, cornices,
and dormer windows. Details on Mediterranean style or vernacular buildings are often done in stone, brick, tile, and
sometimes in stucco. They include arched windows, door openings, and porches. Buildings of medieval inspiration tend to
have details in the form of carved wood or carved stone ornament on window frames, door frames, and eaves. Queen Anne
or late Victorian style buildings tend to have details in wood, stone, or molded brick commonly embellishing cornices,
window frames and door frames. In general, the various styles are rich in architectural details.

 (11) Relationship of roof shapes. Roofs with triangular gables and hip roofs predominate. A few examples of the gambrel-type
roof exist. Complex arrangements of the gabled and/or hip types, with subsidiary roofs, are not unusual. Dormers are
common. Flat roofs exist primarily on porches and sunrooms, and other minor elements; large hip roofs sometimes have
relatively small flat sections in the center.
(12) Walls of continuity. The major wall of continuity is created by the buildings, with their uniform setbacks within the blocks.
New buildings should contribute to this wall of continuity. Where gaslights are sufficiently numerous, and where trees in
rows have survived in sufficient numbers, minor walls of continuity are created. Fences across side lots contribute to the
major wall of continuity where placed at the front yard setback line.
(13) Relationship of significant landscape features and surface treatment. The typical treatment of individual properties is a
flat front lawn area in grass turf, often subdivided by a walk leading to the front entrance, and sometimes with a walk at the
side leading to the rear. Materials for such walks are concrete, brick, or stone, or combinations of those materials. Some
front yards have rectangular raised earthwork terraces upon which the house stands. These unpaved terraces have sloping
embankments or brick and/or stone retaining walls at the change of grade. Foundation plantings, often of a deciduous
character, characteristic of the period 1895—1930, are present virtually without exception. Hedges between properties, and
ornamental front yard fences or hedges are not uncommon. The American elm is virtually extinct in the district, though once
the dominant tree. Replacement trees should be characteristic of the area and period, though only a disease-resistant
American elm would be a practical choice. Plantings of new trees should be directed toward the restoration of the former
straight-line rows of large trees on the front yards and "tree lawns." Straight side driveways leading from the street to rear
garages exist, but alley-facing garages are common, particularly in the southern portion of the district. Where alley-facing
garages are common, the lack of driveways lends a unity to the succession of front lawns. Driveway materials include
concrete, brick and gravel. Side lots are not uncommon in the district, and a number of these form a part of the original site
plan for the residence. Such side lots are usually landscaped, often fenced at or near the setback line, and very occasionally
contain paved areas such as a tennis court. The street right-of-way of eighty (80) feet combined with a pavement width of
between twenty-four (24) and twenty-nine (29) feet creates wide "tree lawns" or berm areas, which adds to the generous
ambience of the urban landscape of the district. Street pavements are now asphalt; cut stone curbs still exist in portions of
the district. Alleys are frequently paved with brick, particularly where alley-facing garages are common. Fencing ranges
widely in type; fencing in public view was generally designed to compliment the style, design material, and date of the
residence.
(14) Relationship of open space to structures. Open space in the district occurs in the form of vacant land, a city park, school
yards for the Waldorf and Nichols Schools, and side lots. Where an original or early arrangement of a house and grounds
included and still includes landscaped lots which form part of the landscaping plan for the residence, such landscaped lots
are significant landscape features.
(15) Scale of facades and facade elements. There is a variety in scale from block to block and style to style; most houses have a
large and substantial appearance. The size and complexity of facade elements and details either accentuate or subdue the
scale of the facades. Facade elements have been determined by what is appropriate for the style. Large wings at the front are
atypical, while small wings at the side, usually in the form of sunrooms and sunporches, are common. Window sash are
usually subdivided by muntins, which affects the apparent scale of the windows within the facades.
(16) Directional expression of front elevations. In general, the expression of direction is neutral.
(17) Rhythm of building setbacks. Because of the existence of various subdivisions and their related subdivision and deed
restrictions, setbacks vary from area to area within the district, though they are consistent within each block or area. The
varying designs of the houses, occasionally with slight setbacks in the facades, cause the houses to relate to the front setback
line in different ways; this creates a slight variation in the setback line. Nevertheless, within each block or area a wall of
continuity is created.
(18) Relationship of lot coverage. Lot coverage ranges from fifty (50) per cent to twelve 912) per cent or less in the case of
homes with large yards. Most homes are in the twenty (20) per cent to thirty (30) per cent range of lot coverage.
(19) Degree of complexity within the facade. The degree of complexity has been determined by what is typical and appropriate
for a given style. The classically inspired buildings usually have simple, rectangular facades with varying amounts of
ornamentation. Other styles, such as "Queen Anne" and those of Medieval inspiration, frequently have facades complicated
by gables, bays, slight setbacks, porches, and occasionally, turrets.
(20) Orientation, vistas, overviews. While most of the buildings are oriented toward the street, it is not unusual for an entrance to
face the side, especially in the case of a landscaped side lot or corner house. The street facade in these cases is well
coordinated with the rest of the street facades. Garages are frequently oriented either toward an alley or a side street; almost
all garages are detached and at the rear of the lot. In those few cases where pre-1930 houses have attached garages, they are
at the rear and are entered from the side or rear. The doors of such attached garages are generally not visible from the street.
(21) Symmetric or asymmetric appearance. Neo-Georgian and other classically inspired buildings are generally symmetrical.
Other styles, including the neo-Tudor, are generally asymmetrical, but balanced compositions.
(22) General environmental character. The Indian Village District, with its long, straight streets, its hierarchy of walls of
continuity (lamps, trees, buildings) and its large, dignified homes, has an urban, substantial, low density residential

 character.

RECOMMENDATION
It is staff’s opinion that the work, as proposed, does not negatively impact the character-defining features of the
historic building, its site, and setting. Staff therefore recommends that the Commission find the proposed landscape
modifications to be appropriate as the work meets the Secretary of the following Interior’s Standards for
Rehabilitation:
• 2) The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of historic materials or
alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided.
• 6) Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration
requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color, texture,
and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features shall be
substantiated by documentary, physical, or pictorial evidence.
• 9) New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials that
characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the
massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its
environment.
• 10) New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken in such a manner that if
removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be
unimpaired.

 REPORT
3. WALL AND PIER REPAIR
After approval from HDC in April 2019 we proceeded to repair the walls. In that process we
discovered a few things. First, the interior structure of the of the wall had been exposed to significant decomposition because of the deterioration of the existing wall coping. This has occurred
for two reasons. About fifty years ago, to save the wall because of deterioration and poor maintenance the surface was entirely parged with an additional thick coat of cement gravel mixture.
While this fix structurally preserved the wall it also flattened out the existing coping eliminating
its overhang. As a result water penetrated behind the cement finish and delaminated it from the
structural brick. The proper fix to preserve the wall, after repairing and removing existing broken
brick is to use concrete coping with an overhang and a saw cut drip edge as to prevent any water
from entering the wall cavity and creating more damage.
Second, upon inspection of the wall we discovered that two types of caps have been used over the
years. One with an articulated edge and the other with square edge profile. Currently there are 6
existing square profiled caps and 10 articulated profile caps remaining. 16 caps have crumbled.
We would like to replace these 16 caps with the existing square profile cap. The articulated edge
profile is three times the cost of the square edge profile adversely affecting our financial ability
to preserve the wall from future deterioration and eventual collapse, but more importantly the
square edge profile would allow us to include a saw cut drip edge in addition to the overhang and
help prevent water penetration in the piers and help their long-term preservation.
