WHEREAS, the Cook County Commission on Social Innovation was established via ordinance, April of

recommendations for the Cook County Board of Commissioners on matters related to economic

improved and expanded passenger train service is essential to maintain Cook County’s economic vitality

disconnected populations should take precedence; and

underemployed residents living in the south and west sides to jobs available in and around O’Hare

WHEREAS, the Cross-Rail Chicago plan seeks to affirm the county’s place as financial, business and
cultural capital of the Midwest by attracting ridership from millions of tourists and visitors every year;
and
WHEREAS, Cross-Rail Chicago proposes coordination between the
and Metra to create a unified, county-wide transportation network
expansion of the Metra Electric line, the Metra North Central service
