CHAIRMAN MOONEY: Great. Thanks, everyone,

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781~9586

 

for coming. I appreciate it.

First order of business is the
approval of the minutes of the last meeting. I
believe you all have one.

Any comments?

I think it?s been duly moved.

MS. NEELY: Yes, it has been.
CHAIRMAN MOONEY: If there's no objection, we
will accept the minutes. Okay.

Tony, do you want to lead us through
the status of previously approved projects?

MR. SMITH: Sure. Thank you.

First of all, before I move off of
this title page here, I want to point out a new
photograph of Testa Produce, gorgeous project that
CDF worked on at the end of 2010. This is on the
upcoming tour, but I'm a fan of that photo.

CHAIRMAN MOONEY: I might mention that this
was done ~w this is Peter Testa's new distribution
facility. It is an incredible facility. And it is
the first industrial facility in the city to get
platinum rating under LEED. We?re hopefully taking
the Mayor out there shortly.

MS. NEELY: What's the address again?

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781-9586

 

MR. SMITH: 4555 South Racine.

And the first LEED platinum freezer/
cooler building in the country.

So previously approved transactions.
To date, 13 transactions have closed since July of
2008, which was the first deal CDF closed. So we
see them broken down by year on this chart.

So in 2011, two projects closed in
their entirety, Institute Health Sciences Career
Academy and Truong Enterprises. And then there's a
preefunding for Mercy Oakwood Shores, which, if
you recall from the last meeting, CDF approved
accepting the qualified equity investment for the
deal in order to show more progress to Treasury in
an effort to get an allocation or a more favorable
allocation in this upcoming round.

The full closing of that deal is
still ongoing. It's a very complicated transaction
involving housing sources, HOPE VI funds, and New
Markets Tax Credits in two separate funding stacks.
And so currently HUD is reviewing the documents for
that deal as part of the required process before we
can fund the loan. That one is moving along well.

Updated map of the projects that CDF

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781-9586

 

has financed, the newest addition being Truong
Enterprises, which is at 2300 South Halsted right
here on the map (indicating).

As far as those projects that I
mentioned previously, the bulk are substantially
complete and open. A couple are still 

CHAIRMAN MOONEY: Let's go back for a second,

Tony.

MR. SMITH: Sure.

CHAIRMAN MOONEY: Not everyone is familiar
with them. At least can you give one sentence
maybe we

MR. SMITH: Absolutely. Yes.

So Homan Powerhouse is a large scale
historic rehab of a former power plant at the Sears
campus in Lawndale. So that's a fully operational
charter school that's related to the Roman
Arthington Foundation.

Greater West Town is a job training
center at 500 North Sacramento on the West Side.
And that's it also operates a small charter
school that caters to students high school
students that have dropped out of the CPS system.

Imperial Zinc is a zinc anode and

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781?9586

 

alloy manufacturer at on lO3rd Street near the
Bishop Ford.

Christ the King is a parochial
school in the Cristo Rey Network. That's at 5088
West Jackson. Very low tuition, very inclusive
school in the Austin neighborhood.

ALDERMAN TUNNEY: Isn?t that where you 
four days of instruction and then one day in the
private sector?

MR. SMITH: Correct. Yes.

ALDERMAN TUNNEY: Okay.

MR. SMITH: Comer Charter, that's a CPS
charter high school at 72nd and South Chicago
that's sponsored by the Comer Foundation and
operated by the Noble Network.

MS. NEELY: And that's all part of the Comer
center over there, right?

MR. SMITH: Correct. Yep.

Charter Steel is a small steel
trading and processing company in Lawndale. So
this was an expansion for Charter Steel that's at
Kedzie I'm sorry, Kostner and Roosevelt.

ALDERMAN TUNNEY: How many approximately

how many jobs are there?

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781?9586

 

MR. SMITH: That one is I believe it's
about 85 jobs.

ALDERMAN TUNNEY: Is that upon complete 
you know, full force right now, 85?

MR. SMITH: I'd have to double check the
number, but I think that was the expansion
resulting from the new facility, which is open and
operating.

PCC Community Wellness is a
federally qualified health clinic on Lake Street in
the Austin community, a $6?l/2 million project,
fully operational at this point.

Testa Produce we just talked about.

Instituto Health Sciences Career 

ALDERMAN TUNNEY: I'm sorry. Again, how many
jobs at Testa now?

MR. SMITH: Testa is about 165.

ALDERMAN TUNNEY: 165?

MR. SMITH: Instituto Health Sciences Career
Academy is a medical sciences focused charter high
school in Little Village at Blue Island and
Western.

Nearing completion. We have the

Radio Flyer project, which was a substantial

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781?9586

 

expansion and rehab of Radio Flyer's legacy
facility out on Grand Avenue at Narragansett. So
that was to add some and prototype
manufacturing space in about 65,000 square feet
of vacant space they had in their large facility
there.

Under construction 

ALDERMAN TUNNEY: Just a little footnote.
How many jobs at this one?

MS. SANCHEZ: I think it has about 30.

ALDERMAN TUNNEY: 30?

MS. SANCHEZ: 30 additional jobs, right. I
think they were 

ALDERMAN TUNNEY: On top of 

MS. SANCHEZ: And I think they retained about
30. So it was about the same number.

MR. SMITH: I'm sorry. I'll bring a complete
list at the next meeting so I can rattle that off.
So that 

MS. SANCHEZ: I have it in I have it.

MR. SMITH: It's blurring together in my
mind.

MS. SANCHEZ: I usually do bring it with me.

I don't have it today.

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781?9586

 

MR. SMITH: Under construction, the Kroc
Community Center, so thatts the Salvation Army
facility at 119th and Racine, 160,000 square foot
multiuse facility with recreation.

MS. NEELY: They're getting a lot of
publicity for that facility. It's all over the
news.

CHAIRMAN MOONEY: Three swimming pools, two
or three gymnasiums.

MS. NEELY: All over the media. And it's
really something 

MS. SANCHEZ: It's huge. I think it's like
165,000 square feet or something.

MS. NEELY: When is it scheduled to open?

MR. SMITH: I think it?s April, May.

MS. NEELY: So soon.

MR. SMITH: Yeah. And that's actually on the
upcoming tour that we have a date to announce. So
hopefully you can all see it.

And the final project, the most
recent to close, Truong Enterprises is an ethnic
produce distributor located at 23rd and Halsted,
and that?s an expansion. They currently already

operate on South Leavitt Street, and they're

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781?9586

 

retaining that space. So this is a completely new
addition for them. It has gone vertical. You can
see the exterior walls if you go down Halsted
Street right about now. And that's 30 full?time
jobs that would be added in that new facility.

CHAIRMAN MOONEY: Tracy, can you send out a
memo with all the job numbers?

MR. SMITH: Sure.

MS. SANCHEZ: Yeah. I usually have it with
me. I just didn't bring it with me today.

MR. SMITH: Sorry about that.

MS. SANCHEZ: We track it.

MR. SMITH: So we finally pinned dewn what we
believe to be a favorable date for a site tour, and
so we'd like to invite the governing board and the
advisory board to attend. That will be Tuesday,
February let. And the plan is to hit three of
those projects, PCC Community Wellness, Testa
Produce, and then the Kroc Community Center.

MS. NEELY: I have a pension board meeting,
so I can't make it.

MS. SCOTT: Yeah.

MS. NEELY: It's also Fat Tuesday.

ALDERMAN TUNNEY: What a day we're having

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781e9586

 

this morning.

MS. NEELY: I'm wondering if I can get to
one. I really wanted to go to the Kroc Center.
That's the last one. But that?s okay.

MR. KING: That actually is going to be the
first one.

MS. NEELY: Oh, it is?

MR. KING: They've got something in the
afternoon.

MS. NEELY: So we're going to what time
should we be at that one?

MR. KING: I think we'll probably be starting
there about 10:00 o'clock, 10:30.

MR. SMITH: 10:30 probably.

MS. NEELY: So we'll be there at 10:30.
Okay. I could probably only go to that one. So
what's the exact address?

MR. SMITH: It is at 119th and Racine. But
we'll send a full invite with all the all the
addresses so people 

MS. NEELY: I'm going to probably just go to
that one.

MS. SCOTT: And the last one is what time?

MR. KING: That's still in flux.

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781-9586

 

MS. SCOTT: Still in flux. Okay.

MR. SMITH: We're hoping to do lunch at Testa
Produce. They.have a nice test kitchen facility.

MS. NEELY: I'll probably just go to that
one.

MR. SMITH: Okay. Is there any chance we can
move the start to earlier?

MS. NEELY: 10:30 is fine for me actually.
Not to say it's going to be easy, but 10:30 works
fer me.

MR. SMITH: Okay.

CHAIRMAN MOONEY: We could do the other two
first and meet us at Kroc at 10:30.

MS. SCOTT: Yeah, that would work.

MR. SMITH: Okay. We'll look into that.
Sure. Okay. Yes.

So that's it in terms of status of

approved projects to date.

CHAIRMAN MOONEY: Any questions?

(No response.)
All right. Go ahead.

MR. SMITH: So summarizing what has

closed on to date by project type, so it's been a

mix of industrial, education facilities, and then

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781?9586

 

other types of community facilities, including
healthcare, job training, and the Salvation Army
multiuse center. .80 it breaks out pretty evenly
between those categories.

As far as what's in closing right
now, the Roseland Plaza project, which is a grocery
deal, still in that process, and then a healthcare
project, which was the Oakwood Shores mixedwuse
project that I mentioned previously where there's a
Mercyuoperated health clinic on the bottom two
floors that the CDF would finanCe and then mixed?
income housing that's being separately developed on
the upper floors.

MS. NEELY: Who's the remind me, who's the
grocery in Roseland?

MR. SMITH: It'll be an Aldi.

MS. NEELY: That's right. I can see their
picture.
MR. SMITH: And then one transaction's on the

docket for potential approval today, and that's
another healthcare transaction; that's Chicago
Family Health Center.

CHAIRMAN MOONEY: Okay.

MR. SMITH: So in terms of CDF's overall

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781?9586

 

prospects for getting more allocation, as you may
all recall, CDF applied for more credits in late
July. So that's the ninth round, or 2011 round,
the Treasury has sponsored. It's still in the
midst of the decisionwmaking process, although the
rumors are that the decisions are made, it's really
just a matter of scheduling a press conference, but
apparently that's stuff to do with Treasurer
Geithner.

And the award announcements, the
rumors are late February, early March at this
point.

In terms of 

MS. NEELY: He announced it last time. Was
it two years ago that he announced it?

CHAIRMAN MOONEY: He did, over on the West
Side.

MR. SMITH: Right.

MS. NEELY: He announced it, yeah.

MR. SMITH: Yeah. That was October of '09 at
the West Town facility.

And then as far as future rounds
beyond the 2011 rounds, currently Congress has not

authorized anything. So the New Markets program,

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781?9586

 

like many other federal programs, is in limbo.

It's been most recently attached to the payroll tax
extension and the business tax extenders bill.

Your guess is as good as mine or probably better as
far as when that would when there'll be action
on that, particularly in a lame duck Congress.

The 2011 round, just a footnote, is

extremely competitive. There were substantially
more applications than in past rounds. Usually
it's about 250 per year. This time it was over

300. And the allocations available from the feds
were shrunk from 5 billion down to 3+1/2 billion
through the most recent Congressional
authorization. So either what that means is that
the award sizes are going to continue to be pretty
modest as CDF experienced in the 2010 round, or
it's going to be a shorter list of allocatees with
more healthy size allocations. There's definitely
been some push/pull within Treasury about which is
the more effective strategy.

So the current rumors are suggesting
a shorter list of allocatees with bigger
allocations, which could out either way for CDF.

MS. HOLT: And what's the range of

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781?9586

 

allocation?

MR. SMITH: Well, CDF requested 111 million,
but its award sizes have been all over the map.
It's at 100 million in the '06 round. 18 million
in the 2010 round. Local allocatees didn?t do so
well in the 2010 round. They got about what CDF
got on average. Let's say historically 50 million
has been a good size award. In the most recent
round, that was about 30 to 35 million given that
the Treasury kept the list the same in terms of
number of allocatees, but there was less to go
around.

MS. SCOTT: Did they drop any allocatees? I
mean, have they been moving them in and out?

MR. SMITH: Yes, there certainly is. Several
repeat round CDEs have ?u didn't get any credits
last round. Couple examples, NCB Capital Impact,
which is a CDFI lender based in Virginia, had, I
think, four or five previous awards and then didn't
get anything in 2010. The Reinvestment Fund in
Philadelphia, kind of a similar story, a very high
performing CDFI, didn't get anything in 2010. So
definitely some allocatees missed some rounds

historically. But fingers crossed.

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781-9586

 

terms of the overall breakdown
of what CDF has received to date and deployed,
173 million in authority to date, total amount
closed 140,5. The total currently in closing 14.5.
So that's the Oakwood Shores and the Roseland Plaza
projects. Total allocation that's on the table
today for consideration is 10 million. So assuming
everything that's been approved and is in closing
gets consummated and this deal today, Chicago
Family Health Center, is approved and closes, that
would leave 8 million from prior allocations.

As far as the pipeline of deals,
currently the dynamic in the industry is that not a
lot of CDEs have a lot of allocation, so there's a
lot of hypothetical requests being made by
projects, and CDEs are in the process of evaluating
what who they can serve and what the timing
would be and the feasibility of prospective
projects. 80 CDF has received a lot of requests
for allocation lately. Currently the pipeline
number is 17 projects totaling 234 million of
requested allocation. We're including in this the
Chicago Family deal, which is in the structuring

line here, $10 million, as well as the two projects

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781?9586

 

Oakwood Shores and Roseland that are in the closing
category. The rest of the projects either are pre?
application phase where they're in discussions with
us about how New Markets work and whether it's a
fit for the project, or they've filed a formal
application to GDPposition how those projects break
down between project type, the trend continues that
community facilities tend to be a heavy user of
this program. That's consistent with sort of the
national progress of the New Markets program.
Nonprofits have been heavy users of it.

We do have two industrial deals in
the pipeline looking ahead. And then the grocery
deal is Roseland Plaza.

MS. SCOTT: We're about 90 percent community
facilities. That seems maybe like that we might be
an outlier with something that high.

MR. SMITH: I don't think nationally that
that's the average. I think you're right, that GDP
is probably heavier in community facilities.

MS. SCOTT: And are we getting in the next

round, are we going to get helped or approved?

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781~9586

 

MR. SMITH: I think the deals that have a
strong job impact would be very desirable both from
mission perspective as well as for sort of
brownie points with Treasury. So and we
certainly heard that message from this board, and
we continue to assume that's the message unless we
hear otherwise.

MS. SCOTT: Thank you.

ALDERMAN TUNNEY: Could you elaborate a
little bit on the two industrials? Who are they?

MR. SMITH: Sure. One is a project that's
also in discussions for TIF funding. It's called
Cedar Concepts. It's a chemical manufacturer down
in the Stockyards area. I think it's the only
minority female owned chemical plant in the
country.

ALDERMAN TUNNEY: That's right. I've already
heard about it.

CHAIRMAN MOONEY: The TIF came up before the
CDC. I

MR. SMITH: And the other one is a company
called Heater Works that's also in discussions for
TIF funding. And so that's a recent prospect that

approached us. So we're working through how the

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781?9586

 

New Markets program works and how it would fit for
their project.
ALDERMAN TUNNEY: Actually, I heard about it

because it came up in a conversation about the

layout. There?s a piece of property across the
road from this chemical that the City is looking
to negotiate a very low purchase price. And the

way they wanted to lay out, that somehow didn't
work, but -- I'm just kind of I don't know
where I've heard it in the last week actually
about this phenomenal, you know, story down there,
trying to make sure that she has the ability to
grow.

CHAIRMAN MOONEY: She's got a great story.
She's owned the company now ten years plus. And
it's been profitable, knock on wood, every year.
They're interested in a couple of parcels in the
Stockyards that, frankly, we haven't been able to
get rid of. I shouldn't say that for the record.
But at any rate, we would be delighted to have her
in the Stockyards.

ALDERMAN TUNNEY: And what I heard was
something about her layout over chemical tanks or

something, that the City wanted it didn't 

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781-9586

 

wanted a certain part of that parcel or whatever.
So it was something about the actual layout of her
expansion that was somewhat problematic, so

MS. SCOTT: What kind of chemicals is she
manufacturing?

CHAIRMAN MOONEY: It's cosmetic products.
It's nontoxic. A lot of it.

ALDERMAN TUNNEY: Let's hope.

CHAIRMAN MOONEY: I have not heard that
problem.

MR. SMITH: Oh, I should mention too that CDF
continues to communicate with the staff within HED
that are on the front lines with industrial
businesses letting them know, look, we've done now
five transactions in the industrial space. There's
a track record. We're available to work with those
companies. So we would certainly love to do more
jobs deals.

CHAIRMAN MOONEY: Any questions on potential
projects?

(No response.)
If not, let's move to the one
project that we need to take action on. Tony.

MR. SMITH: Okay. So this is Chicago Family

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781?9586

 

Health Center. It's a federally qualified health
center. So a community health clinic that's
supported by HRSA, which is a federal department
within Health and Human Services. So it?s similar
in its operating focus to PCC Community Wellness.

I will say that along with jobs
deals, these healthcare deals are among the most
highly prized nationally in the New Markets program
as far as brownie points with Treasury and
community impact.

So this would be this is an
experienced operator. They have several sites:
already in Chicago; five locations to be exact.

MS. NEELY: Are they all over the city, or
are they primarily south?

MR. SMITH: Primarily south. Their main
flagship facility is at 9119 South Exchange in the
South Chicago neighborhood. And they've been
operating for over 30 years successfully in Chicago
serving that community.

MS. NEELY: What ward is this new facility?

MR. SMITH: This is in the 9th Ward.

So this would be a grounduup new

facility, LEED silver is the target, located on

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781*9586

 

115th Street in the Pullman neighborhood.
MS. NEELY: 115th?
MR. SMITH: Yes.

So we include 21 medical exam rooms,
9 dental operatories with support facilities for
that, and then behavioral health, social services,
and case management space.

Dental is particularly noteworthy.
There's a serious shortage of dental care in the
Pullman community and in general in poor
communities across the country. It's the feds
have designated this a healthcare professional
shortage area for primary care, for mental health,
and for dental. So CFHC actually already operates
in that neighborhood, but just in a very small 3500
square foot facility that is outmoded and
overcrowded. So this would be a dramatic
expansion, almost ten times growth of the square
footage they have. So they can grow their visits
per year to up to 52,000 and would also offer a
more common area space for wellness events,
preventative care, community education, essentially
getting out ahead of health issues before they need

to be remedied.

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781~9586

 

Let's see. Some more about CFHC.
They serve an extraordinarily lowuincome

population, very consistent with the New Markets

program mission. 52 percent of their patients are
on Medicaid. 10 percent are on additional to
that are on Medicaidwmanaged plans. 35 percent of
all their patients are uninsured. 99 percent are

below the CDFI Fund low?income threshold, which is
80 percent of area median income. 85 percent are
below poverty. And about 5 percent meet the
federal definition of homeless.

So part_of the nature of federally
qualified health centers is that they don't deny
care to anybody, they serve anybody that walks in
the doors. For patients that have an income below
200 percent of the federal poverty line, there's a
sliding scale of fees for services with a minimum
fee as low as $20.

There?s a trade association for
these federally qualified health centers that's
called the Illinois Primary Healthcare Association,
and they've taken steps in recent years, and
hopefully Alderman Tunney would appreciate this, to

quantify economic impact from these community

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781?9586

 

health clinics in terms of jobs and also economic
activity. So CFHC has done a study of its impact
translating to about 24 million of goods and
services procurement per year. And that's 2008.
They've expanded significantly since then. 6.2
million in uncompensated care was provided in 2011.
And they employ 210 employees with payroll of over
$12.6 million currently.

As far as this project that's in
front of GDP, it would retain 23?1/2 full-time
equivalent positions and create 22 new full-time
positions with an average wage of almost $23 an
hour.

MS. SCOTT: And their annual cash flows come
from 

MR. SMITH: It's a mix for these facilities.
They do get some insurance payments, primarily
Medicaid, and then they also get Section 330 grants
from HRSA. That's a longstanding program that
subsidizes this type of clinic. They get
$5 million a year, I believe, under Section 330.

MR. KING: 5.3.

MR. SMITH: 5.3. So it's those two

sources make up the bulk of their revenue stream.

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781-9586

 

MS. SCOTT: They're taking a lot of debt.

MR. SMITH: For this project?

MS. SCOTT: Taking a lot. Yes.

MR. SMITH: Well, we can break that down. I
think 

MS. SCOTT: No. I get it.

MR. SMITH: As far as the sources of funds
for this project, the largest single source is
actually a capital grant from HRSA, the Health
Resources and Services Administration. HRSA grants
are funded on a reimbursement basis. And so HRSA's
actually adepted a policy on how you integrate
these grants with New Markets Tax Credit deals. An
NMT has to be funded all up front and flow through
a complex transaction structure. HRSA wants to
directly reimburse to the project, but they have
guidelines to sort of split the difference between
those requirements.

MS. SCOTT: And that's just the HRSA money?

MR. SMITH: It needs to be bridged. So MB
Financial is the lender that has provided a bridge
loan commitment to front fund the HRSA grant, and
then as construction proceeds, there'll be gradual

drawdowns on the HRSA money and gradual repayment

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781-9586

 

with MB's bridge loan. And that will all happen
outside the New Markets structure so that the
structure stays static at the $10 million level.

MS. NEELY: What's the total cost of the
project?

MR. SMITH: It's still about 10.1 million.

MS. NEELY: And so you this chart says
that 60 percent is coming from the HRSA grant?

MR. SMITH: Right. In terms of underlying
funding. But at closing, it would be 60 percent
from MB's bridge loan. And then MB's also
providing about $2 million in term debt. So that's
the portion that if you're sort of cutting
through the structure, that's the portion that
CFHC's cash flow has to support. They are going to
fundraise for this facility, so that'll be probably
plan A as far as how to repay that. But MB has
alSO underwritten their operating cash flow, which
has been pretty stable over the years.

Historically they've cleared about a million
dollars per year that's available for things like
that.

So really MB has underwritten both

avenues to repayment and is comfortable with a

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, 
(312) 781?9586

 

seven?year term on that debt. And then the balance
would come from tax credit equity. JP Morgan Chase
would be the investor.

So this would be the first time that
MB Financial has participated directly in a New
Markets transaction funding through the structure,
which is a big deal for banks. This is a it?s

very challenging to get bank debt to flow through

'New Markets Tax Credit structure. So far CDF's had

success with Harris Bank and Northern Trust,
getting MB into the program as well. They were
involved in the Testa Produce deal but in a much
simpler, easier to swallow format where they just
loaned directly to the project on a senior basis
and then CDF came in subordinate. Here MB is truly
integrating with the financing structure and not
getting a mortgage on the project. So it's a big
leap that they're taking.

MS. SCOTT: I think we should just
acknowledge the work that they've done to do that.
They're also probably the leading lender now to the
nonprofit base generally. They're doing an
extraordinary job trying to support the community,

and they really deserve to be lauded for their

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
{312) 781*9586

 

efforts_to try and help.

MR. SMITH: Yeah. And CFHC did shop this
deal around to a couple lenders, and MB was
definitely by far the most responsive and the
most 

MS. SCOTT: Very impressive. They've been a
leading lender to charters and to private schools
and to churches.

MR. SMITH: So that's what I have on the
transaction.

CHAIRMAN MOONEY: Before we turn to
questions, Rafael Leon is chair of our advisory
group. And you had a chance to look at this the
other day.

MR. LEON: Yes, we did, and we approved it.

What we requested was to getting, for any

?transactions, more information about the operation

of budgets for the corporations or the entities,
because, as this points out, something that there

are a lot of cuts in funding for this type of

organization. So we wanted to make sure that there
was enough funding to operate the facility. So
that was our request. But we approved the

transaction.

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781?9586

 

CHAIRMAN MOONEY: Thank you.
Any questions?
MS. SCOTT: Very impressive. Motion to
approve.
CHAIRMAN MOONEY: A motion. And a second.
ALDERMAN TUNNEY: Second.
CHAIRMAN MOONEY: Great.
Without further discussion, we'll
take a vote. All those in favor, say aye.
(Chorus of ayes.)
Any nays?
(No response.)
Okay. So moved.
Any other business before us?
ALDERMAN TUNNEY: I just want to say, Rafael
and to our CFO, the cash flow, you know, in paying
this and the ability of the patients to pay, I see
there's a minimum 520 payment for the user on this.
Still, $20 is a lot of money for some people,
especially when you're 85 percent of the
population is below whatever percent below.
MS. NEELY: And 5 percent homeless.
MR. LEON: Yeah. We were more concerned 

we were concerned about the long?term feasibility

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781?9586

 

the operations of the organization. We wanted
to make sure, because in one of the charts, I think
that it shows 52 percent come from Medicaid or
Medicare, another percentage comes from private
insurance. What about the rest? And so we wanted
to make sure that there's longwterm stability for
the organization.

MR. SMITH: Yeah. We can comment that
CFHC the program the Section 330 has been
funding projects like this since 1974. And CFHC
has had a very stable relationship with that
funding source.

There's a five-year reauthorization

cycle through HRSA. They're next up in 2015 for
that. But essentially if you don't get flying

colors approval from HRSA, you get a remediation

plan or you have to put a remediation plan in
place, but your funding doesn't stop. It's just
a it's a matter of taking corrective action.

CFHC has never had to take any corrective action.
They've had no problems getting reapproved.

And so part of what CDF would get as
monitoring on this would be their annual reports to

HRSA and HRSA's feedback. So if there's any sort

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781?9586

 

early indications that they might not get full
reauthorization with no caveats, then we would find
out immediately.

CHAIRMAN MOONEY: Okay.

MS. HOLT: How many other facilities do they
have?

MR. SMITH: They have five currently.

MS. NEELY: In this area?

MR. SMITH: Yeah.

CHAIRMAN MOONEY: Okay. Motion to adjourn.

MR. LEON: We also made a request, when we
look at the money that has been disbursed, to get
an idea of how many private owners are being
leveraged including other City money. So we're
requesting that for the next meeting, if we can get
it saying so, out of the $200 million that has been
disbursed through the program, what is the leverage
with the private financing?

CHAIRMAN MOONEY: Good question. So you'll
bring that for us?

MR. SMITH: Correct. Yes. Yeah, we know the
aggregate total, and CDF has provided approaching
40 million of subsidy to date, the tax credit

equity piece; and leveraged about 250 million of

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781-9586

 

other of total investment as a result of that.
But Rafael's question is a good one, what is the
breakdown of that leveraged investment, are there
other City programs that constitute part of it.
And the answer to that is yes. But we can quantify
it.
CHAIRMAN MOONEY: Okay. Motion to adjourn.
MS. SCOTT: Motion.
CHAIRMAN MOONEY: All in favor.
(Chorus of ayes.)
Thank you, everyone.
(Which were all the proceedings

had this day.)
