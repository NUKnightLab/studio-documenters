ACTION REQUESTED

Recommend this item to the Executive Committee at its
November 2019 meeting:
Adopts safety related performance targets for calendar year 2020
for inclusion in the current 2018-2021 Transportation Improvement
Program (TIP) and the AIM Forward 2040 Long Range
Transportation Plan.

PREVIOUS ACTION

This action updates safety performance targets approved by the
Board of Directors (Resolution 2019-022) for the current 2018-2021
Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) and the AIM Forward
2040 Long Range Transportation Plan.
4-1

 BACKGROUND
• Safety Performance Management (Safety PM)
is part of FHWA’s overall Transportation
Performance Management program
•
•
•

Started in MAP-21
Continued in the FAST Act
23 CFR490: FHWA’s Safety Performance
Management Measures Final Rule

• Supports the Highway Safety Improvement
Program (HSIP)

4-1

 BACKGROUND
Five Safety Performance Measures:
1. Number of Fatalities
2. Number of Serious Injuries
3. Rate of Fatalities per 100 million Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT)
4. Rate of Serious Injuries per 100 million VMT
5. Number of Non-motorized Fatalities and Non-motorized Serious Injuries

Based on five-year rolling averages

4-1

 BACKGROUND
In March 2019, the Board of Directors adopted ODOT
targets of 1% reduction for all performance
measures:
• ODOT’s Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP) and
NOACA’s Regional Safety Program (RSP) share parallel goals
• ODOT: Strategic Highway Safety Plan
• NOACA: SAVE: NOACA’s Plan for Transportation Safety

• Both safety plans share a zero deaths vision
• Similar emphasis areas

Note: The data points for 2018 shown in gray above reflect the “rolling 5-year
averages” in each category, NOT the annual performance for that year.

 BACKGROUND
Target Setting Establishment:

• State: August 31 annually
• MPO: February 27 annually (180 days after the State)

4-1

 BACKGROUND
MPO Target Setting Requirements

• Agree to plan and program projects so that they contribute
toward the accomplishment of the State DOT safety target for
a safety performance measure
- or • Commit to a quantifiable target for a safety performance
measure for the metropolitan planning area

4-1

 TARGET SETTING RECOMMENDATION
This year, ODOT increased the reduction for safety
targets in all five areas from 1% to 2%.

• Recommended to adopt ODOT targets of a 2% reduction
for all safety performance measures.

 TARGET SETTING RECOMMENDATION
MPO Support of State HSIP Targets
• Address areas of concern for fatalities and serious injuries
• Include performance measures in the Metropolitan
Transportation Plan (Long Range Transportation Plan)
• Integrate the safety goals, objectives, performance measures,
and targets into the MPO planning process
• Link investment priorities of the TIP to achievement of HSIP
targets.
4-1

 NEXT STEPS

• Pending Board approval, the AIM Forward 2040 plan and the
2018-2021 TIP will be amended to reflect the CY 2020
adopted safety targets.
• Staff will support these targets by working to implement the
recommendations and strategies outlined in “SAVE: NOACA’s
Regional Safety Action Plan.”
