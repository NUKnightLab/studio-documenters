The following projects were reviewed by the PRC:
1.

200 W. Menomonee
(Old Town Triangle District – 43rd Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed re-cladding of the east (Wells) façade of a 3-story, noncontributing residential condominium building with new panelized, thinbrick cladding.

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. As proposed panelized brick veneer manufactured by Owensboro
Brick Co. with the red-brown color designated as “Old Oakley” is
approved. The pointing mortar shall match the existing color and
joint profile;
2. A section detail and elevation drawing showing the proposed window
surround treatment, including the brick soldier course installed flush
to the façade and 4” limestone sill, shall be submitted for Historic
Preservation staff review and approval with the permit application;
3. A detail showing the proposed butt joint between the new panelized
thin brick veneer on the front (Wells/east) facade and the existing
panelized thin brick veneer and vinyl siding on the Menomonee
(south) elevation to remain shall be submitted for Historic Preservation
staff review and approval with the permit application; and,
4. Any future phases of this project, such as for the south elevation, shall
be consistent with these conditions and shall be reviewed at the staff
level.

 2.

100-114 W. Germania Place, 1538-42 N. Clark St.
(Germania Club Building - Proposed – 42nd Ward)
Proposal:

Action:

Proposed conceptual review and approval of the following changes to
identified exterior and interior significant historic and architectural
features and spaces of the building, depending upon future tenant needs
and uses:
1. Insert new mezzanine floors within both the ballroom and the dining
room spaces. Construct a new ramp in the ballroom and new stairs in
the dining room.
2. Raise the roof to the top of the existing parapet to accommodate new
habitable space within the attic level; and new window openings on
the north and west elevations at the attic level.
3. Create an accessible lobby at the first- floor east of the main entrance
stair, including a new elevator that would access all floors of the
building.
4. Infill the existing north lightwell to create space for a new freight
elevator and mechanical equipment.
5. Create an accessible lobby at the north of the Clark Street elevation, to
access a new elevator.
6. Remove portions of walls in the three connecting rooms and the
enclosed porch on the mezzanine level (between the first and second
floors) and in the solarium on the second floor.
The Committee unanimously found that:
Given, the scale, magnitude and nature of the proposed changes
relative to their impact on the significant interior spaces, as well as the
rooflines of the building, the information as submitted is incomplete
and insufficient to make such a determination, even on a conceptual
basis. The proposed work may, in some form, meet the Commission’s
permit review standards and criteria with further review and design
development—depending on the ultimate design, dimensions,
materials, details, and other information such as programmatic and
code issues that will affect the proposed changes. The potential
cumulative effect of all these changes to the historic character,
features, and spaces of the building should also be considered.
The Committee therefore continued its review of the proposed project so
that the following preliminary comments could be addressed and
necessary additional information submitted:
1. Inserted Floors. The insertion of a new additional floor(s) within
a significant interior space in order to accommodate a new use

 should only be considered after evaluating and excluding other
alternatives. An inserted floor should not damage or destroy the
structural system; or obscure, damage or destroy the historic space,
features or finishes. The design of an inserted floor should be
compatible, but differentiated, with the historic character and
features; as visually unobtrusive as possible; and also reversible so
that if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the
space would remain.
(A) Ballroom. As proposed, the inserted floor would extend
from the western end of the ballroom for more than three bays
of the four-bay length of the room, with a connecting ‘bridge’
spanning the remaining distance to the eastern end. The design
is in concept proposed to be free-standing and as structurally
minimal, visually unobtrusive and transparent as possible. As
proposed, the new floor’s size, scale and configuration,
however, would be visually obtrusive, and would not appear to
be secondary or subsidiary to the space; and would adversely
affect the overall visual experience of the volume as well as
limit views of the overall space, ceiling and domes, the
mezzanine- level gallery, and other features. The design should
be further studied to address the following:
(a) Configuration/Area: The new inserted floor may be
attached, as proposed, to the blank, windowless western
wall of the room. The new floor should, however, be no
more than two bays in length and should not extend past
the middle of the room; and a substantial setback should be
maintained along the north and south walls, so that the new
inserted floor remains a free-standing, secondary feature,
leaving the remainder of the room unobstructed;
(b) Height: The height of the new floor should be further
studied relative to the (i) overall volume of the space as
well as (ii) the proposed use of the floor and the lower level
and (iii) in relationship to the architectural features and
ornament on the side walls;
(c) ‘‘Bridge’’ Connection: No more than one ‘‘bridge’’
connection between the new inserted floor and the gallery
level should be provided (a code analysis should be
provided if more than one ‘‘bridge’’ connection is
proposed). The ‘bridge’ connection should be located in
the westernmost two bays, and as far as possible from the
projecting bay of the gallery. No ‘bridge’ connection
should connect the eastern edge of the inserted floor with
the eastern wall of the room or to the projecting bay of the

 gallery; and
(d) Design/Materials: The proposed design is to be as
minimal and visually unobtrusive as possible. Additional
information about the design, materials, dimensions, and
details should be submitted, as well as structural and code
analyses for the proposed design.
(B) Dining Room. As proposed, the new inserted floor would
extend the width of the room at the rear of the space. The new
floor is proposed to span from wall to wall, with no added
vertical supports, and to be as structurally minimal, visually
unobtrusive and transparent as possible. Some changes to
openings between the dining room, ballroom and gallery level
are also proposed. The design should be further studied to
address the following:
(a) Design/Materials: The design is in concept proposed to
be as minimal and visually unobtrusive as possible,
spanning wall to wall with no added vertical supports or
brackets. Additional information about the design,
materials, dimensions, and details should be submitted, as
well as structural and code analyses for the proposed
design—particularly regarding wall connections and
whether additional structural support, reinforcement or
other modifications will be required; and the layout of the
new inserted floors themselves; and
(b) Rear/Side Walls: The new opening on the south wall to
connect the new, upper- most floor level within the corner
tower (the existing attic space, dubbed the “Capone
Room”) with the new inserted floors within the dining
room, should be further studied. A greater portion of the
rear wall should remain than what is proposed in order to
retain a “punched-opening” character to the new opening(s)
within the wall. Photographs and elevation drawings of the
south wall, as well as the portions of the east and west
walls of the dining room where the new inserted floors are
proposed, shall be submitted; elevation drawings shall
indicate areas of proposed demolition or other modification
as well as existing historic features and finishes. Also, a
structural analysis of the proposed changes to
accommodate the new opening(s) for the Capone Room
shall be provided.
2. New Ramp/Stairs. The design of the lower-level ramp (Ballroom)
and new stair (Dining Room) should be as visually unobtrusive as

 possible and reversible. Additional information should be
submitted, including the design, materials, dimensions, and details
(including for the connection, if any, along the wall); and should
also address the relative visibility of the ramp/stairs and railings
through the windows.
3. Roof/Attic Level. The roof is proposed to be minimally raised to
accommodate a new attic level of habitable spaces. The following
information should be provided:
(a) Additional information (i) demonstrating that the new roof
will not be higher than the existing parapet or otherwise affect
the exterior appearance of the building (including dimensio ned
sections showing existing and proposed floor-to-ceiling
heights, existing and proposed parapet and roof heights, etc.);
and (ii) regarding the details and potential visibility of the
proposed skylights;
(b) A structural analysis and a code analysis (building, lifesafety, vent-and- light, etc.) shall be provided, including but not
be limited to the condition of the exterior walls and parapets,
the proposed new roof structure-parapet wall connection, the
existing roof trusses, occupancy, floor loads, etc. Any
demolition, structural and/or other modifications should be
identified, including existing and proposed plans; and
(c) Additional information about how (i) mechanical equipment
will be accommodated in the new spaces as well as the location
and dimensions of any exterior equipment or venting; and
information on how (ii) the domes will be protected as part of
the new attic- level use.
4. New Elevator.
The placement of a new elevator within
significant interior spaces in order to accommodate a new use
should only be considered after evaluating and excluding other
alternatives such as non-significant interior spaces. The new
feature should not damage or destroy the structural system; or
obscure, damage or destroy the historic space, features or finishes.
The design of the elevator should be compatible, but differentiated,
with the historic character and features; be as visually unobtrusive
as possible; and also be reversible so that if removed in the future,
the essential form and integrity of the space would remain.
A new cylindrical, free-standing elevator is proposed to be located
adjacent to the main entrance of the building. The elevator is
proposed to serve all floors (basement to new attic level) and
would impact some of the significant interior spaces (i.e., the
mezzanine level between the first and second floors) and the corner

 solarium (labeled “bar”) connecting the ballroom and dining room.
The preferred location for the elevator would be in an area that
does not impact any significant interior spaces. The location and
design should be further studied to address the following:
(a) Additional information, including dimensioned
plans/sections and product specifications, demonstrating that
the elevator override will not be higher than the existing
parapet or otherwise affect the exterior appearance of the
building. A structural and building code analysis shall also be
provided for the proposed elevator;
(b) Design/Materials: Additional information about the
design, materials, dimensions and details shall be submitted,
including how the new elevator will impact historic features
(e.g., ornamental features, doors at the back of the theater,
ceiling, moldings, etc.) in the significant historic spaces.
Photographs and elevation drawings of these spaces shall be
submitted; elevation drawings shall indicate any areas of
proposed demolition or other modification as well as existing
historic features and finishes; and
(c) Alternative Locations/Use: An analysis of alternative
locations for the elevator shall be prepared and submitted.
5. North lightwell: The enclosure of a lightwell on a secondary
elevation may meet the guidelines of the Commission. However a
dimensioned north elevation and other information indicating the
existing and proposed condition of the infill of the light well,
including the height of the proposed rooftop penthouse and
elevator overrides, materials, etc. should be submitted for review.
6. Programmatic Issues/Use:
Future actual tenant uses will
determine the need, if any, for the proposed new inserted floors as
well as their desired design, size and configuration. Such uses will
also dictate structural, occupancy, floor loads, exiting, fire-rating,
and other code requirements for the new floors, which in turn will
affect the design of the new floors, the thickness of their structural
members and structural connections, and their relative visual
transparency and unobtrusiveness within the larger space.
Furthermore, the actual use will also impact the relative visual
transparency and unobtrusiveness of the new floors within their
respective historic spaces (e.g., tall bookshelves or other tall
display fixtures and the resulting impact on the visual openness
and character of the room). Similarly, the future tenants and uses
of the building will also inform the need, if any, for the elevator at
the proposed location, as well as whether it is to serve all or some
floors. Given this, it is recommended that the proposed project (or

 series of projects) be further studied and developed based on the
actual use, program and tenant needs, once identified.
7. Other: The following additional information should be provided:
(a) Additional information and details regarding other proposed
changes, including but not limited to signage, mechanical
equipment, new lobbies and storefront modifications, interior
walls to be removed on the mezzanine floor and solarium, etc.;
(b) Photographs and elevation drawings of all significant
interior spaces; elevation drawings shall indicate any proposed
modification as well as all existing historic features and
finishes;
(c) Light fixtures and other original fixtures within the
significant historic features shall all be retained and preserved;
such fixtures should be identified in the submitted plans and
information; and
(d) Additional information and details for the proposed new
window openings on the north and west elevations and the
penthouse structure (which were not submitted in time to be
reviewed as part of this submission).
The committee further directed the Historic Preservation staff to work
with the applicant to respond to the above comments. When the above
comments have been addressed, the project may be agendized again for
PRC review.
