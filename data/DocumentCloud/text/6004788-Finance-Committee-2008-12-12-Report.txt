Sum-mag .
The Cook County Health and Hospitals System year to date .

?nancial results ?nished the tenth month of the ?scal year behind
the budget by almost 28%. The poorer than planned ?nancial
performance was due to lower Patient Service Revenue, IGT
Revenue, and Nat?Operating Revenue. The overall revenue
shortfall at the end of the tenth month was $58,588,555 below the
budget for the same period 1n time. ExpenSes were also below

1 budget. The favorable level of expenses was not enough to offset

the shortfall 1n revenue.

Operating Revenue

Fees at the end of September collected from patient services were 
below budget year to date by 11 The September year to date
- shortfall from bddget was an improvement from the level at the

end of August where patient fees were 12. 5% below the budget. It
is expected that by the end of ?scal year there will be further .
improvement in collected fees. as compared to the budget. Patient -
- fees are expected to fall short 0f the budget by approxirnately 7%
or $21.5 million dollars by the end of the ?scal year. The largest
source of unfavorable patient service revenue is from the shortfall

of Medicaid patient fees.

IThe Intergovernmental Transfer Revenue continues to be short cf
the budget due to the phase out of one federal program. The 
System has been working with the of?cials of the State Medicaid
program to offset the loss Of IGT revenue. The 2008 loss of IGT 1s .
$15, 004, 000. Through the efforts of the system management and
the consultants they have arranged for the System to receiVe 
approximately $11, 697, 000 by the end of the ?scal year. IGT
revenue will by the end of the ?scal year still be below the budget 
by approximately 307, 000. The additional funds received from
the State to offset the loss of the IGT were paid to the County 111
two different methOds. An additional transfer of $3,697,000 was
received ?rst and the $8,000,000 balance or the $11 6,97, 000 was 3

16

received as an increase of November patient fees. The increase in
patient fees was paid by adjusting the of revenue that the State

requires the county to return to the State.

Other Revenue at the end of September IS in excess of the budget
by $1,723,106 or 36. If this trend continues through the end of
the ?scal year Other Revenue Will be 1n excess of the budget by

approximately 2.1 million dellars.

Total Operating Revenue at the end of the ?scal year may be
belOw budget by approXimately 34. 7 million dollars

Operating Expenses
Operating Expenses at the end of- September Were below budget by

6. 2% or $53 957, 018. This favorable expense performance was
due to positive variances for supplies, PUrcha'sed Services, and 1
Utilities. Salaries and Employee Bene?ts were over the budget by

relatively small amOunts year to date.

Salaries and Wages? 662, 118 or 
Salaries and wages continue to exceed the budget at the end of

September. The use of overtime and replacement time for the
. . holiday 1n September contributed to this unfavorable variance.

Overtime is being monitored by the System management and' is

used to ?ll staffing needs. There are a large number of staff-

positions that remain un?lled and these vacancies create the need
to use overtime. -
Stroger Hospital 15 over budget year to date for salaries and wages 
and Provident Hospital and Oak Forest Hospital are below budget.

Bene?ts- 519 or 
The level of Bene?t expense is directly related to salary and Wage

eXpense. Bene?ts for employees are over bUd'get because salaries
and wages are also in excess of budget. - 

17

Supplies? $20,197,413 or 16. 4%

Each of the System facilities supply expenses are below the budget
year to date. The System 18 still using the accrual convention to 

measure supply expense based on the actual expenditures at the

end of the period plus 40%.

Purchased Services, Rental, and Other - $36,563,402 '01- 29.17%
The year to date level expenses for the System for this Category-
continues to be signi?cantly below the budget. The method used

7 to estimate expense is the same for purchased services as is used

for supplies

. . Utilities- 692, 841- or 15.3% 
The estimated System year to date expense for utilities 1n total 13
belbw the budget. The most favbrable utility expense performance
as compared to the budget is for StrOger Hospital. Expenses for 
utilities at Stroger are below the budget by 437, 500 or 19. 
Oak Forest?s utility expense is below the budget by $356143 or
11. Provident Hospital?s utility expense is in excess of the 4

budget by $100, 801 or 

System Expenses per Adjusted Patient Day

A comparison of year to date expenses per adjusted patient day to
the budget 13 as follows. - -

Institution - Budget I Actual Variance 
Stroger $4,035.37 $3,850.66 

Oak Forest $5,148.85 1 $3,675.88 3 28.6%-
Provident . $5,221.59 1 $3,841.36 26.4% 

on eratin Revenue 1 
Non operating revenue at the end of September Was below budget

by 8% or $34, 347, 328. The largest shortfall from budget Is for -

 

18

sales tax. It 18 still expected that the receipts for sales tax will
increase in October and November. The increased receipts for the
last two months of the ?scal year will be the result of- the increase
in the rate of sales tax that Occurred on July 1,2008. The actual
receipts from the' morease will begin to be recorded 1n the last two

months of the ?scal year.

The decline 1n the level of cigarette tax revenue from the level
expected 1n the budget rs not expected to inerease in the remaining
two months of the ?scal year. The decline could be a combination
of factors causing the reduced revenue such as fewer people are

. smokers, a decline 1n the pOpulation, and the poor economic

conditions 1n Illinois.

The implants were used for the treatment of necessary orthopedic

the Department of Surgery 1n November of 2007 as a method to
decrease the total number of orthopedic vendors and decrease the

cost of implants per case. We expect this endeavor to result 1n

price concessions of at least 40% from each vendor. The RF 08-

appropriate or applicable considerations and respond to them based on the unique needs of their communities and
the hospital?s mission and circumstances.

How to Use this Worksheet

policies for uninsured and underinsured patients. The questions are discussed in depth in .H'ospimls Slime Insights to
lemmas Policies for Uninsured and Underinsnred li?atierzts: A Report from the Patient friendly Billing Pro-jest.
The worksheet offers point-by-point considerations for different aspects of each question, which can be helpful in
analyzing the hospital?s current policies and potential changes.

The goal of using this tool is to ensure that your organization has a clear policy statement for each point that is
considered appropriate or relevant for the organization. By filling in the fields for actions needed, who needs buy-in,

and who needs training, you?ll create the basis of a work plan for ensuring that the policy decisions are disseminated
and implemented throughout your organization.

Dear Colleagues,

We are classed to present this report on the

surrounding discounting and collection practices for
patients with limited abil to pay. As increasing numbers
of? hospitals are updating their '53 naocial po licies. they

Each hospital and community has unique considera?

apply to all hesgitals. By'addressing the following seven
questions. each hospital can develop responsible. hal

3. What discount I evels are offered??

4. How are policies communicated?

REPORT OF THE TASK FORCE ON
CHARITY CARE AND COLLECTION PRACTICES FOR THE UNINSURED
of the
ILLINOIS HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION
and the
METROPOLITAN CHICAGO HEALTHCARE COUNCIL

Adopted by the Board of Trustees of the Illinois Hospital Association
September 11, 2003

Adopted by the Board of Directors of the Metropolitan Chicago Healthcare Council
September 8, 2003

Qtroductiop: Why ow?

In recent months, hospitals across the nation and in Illinois have been accused of overbilling
uninsured, poor, and immigrant patients and using aggressive collection practices. In Illinois the
charge has been led by a coalition of labor union and immigrant groups. Onelof these unions, the
Service Employees International Union (SEIU), is seeking to organize the employees of
Advocate Health Care. In the publications of its Hospital Accountability Project, SEIU has
singled out Advocate hospitals for alleged ?discriminatory pricing,? ?price gouging,? and
aggressive collection practices. The project claims that Chicago-area Latino immigrants are
disproportionately affected because they are more likely to be uninsured than the native-born.

The complaints of the labor unions and immigrant groups have found a sympathetic ear in the
Chicago City Council, the Cook County Board of Commissioners, and among Latino legislators
in the Illinois General Assembly. The Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights is
asking the General Assembly to enact legislation to protect uninsured patients from
?discriminatory? pricing and aggressive collection practices by hospitals. State Rep. Hairy
Osterman (D?Chicago) and state Sen. Martin Sandoval (D-Chicago), cochairmen of the Joint
Legislative Task Force on Immigrants and Refugees, held a town hall meeting in Chicago
August 19 where uninsured community members, often speaking through translators, told of
dif?culties in navigating the health care system, paying their hospital bills, and making
themselves understood. The legislators have promised to hold more hearings this fall. At the
federal level, US. Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D?4th) has asked the General Accounting Of?ce the

investigative arm of Congress to conduct a study of the issues.

Against this backdrop, the Illinois Hospital Association and Metropolitan Chicago Healthcare
Council have appointed a joint membership task force to review hospital charity care policres
and collection practices for the uninsured and to recommend steps Illinois hospitals might take to

respond to the concerns that have been raised.

I. Hospitals and the Uninsured: Statement of the Problem

Illinois hospitals have a longstanding commitment to improving health care for all residents,
including the uninsured. Almost 1.7 million Illinoisans 600,000 of them living in Chicago and
many of them immigrants and the working poor have no health insurance. Yet Illinms hospltals

are there for them whenever they need patient care:

0 Illinois hospitals provide more than $2 billion annually in medical care for which they do
not receive payment, including charity care.

0 Illinois hospitals typically assist uninsured patients in applying for government?sponsored
health care programs for which they may be eligible, such as Medicare, Medicaid, and

KidCare.

0 Illinois hospitals have long supported efforts to expand the number of persons covered by
the State?s health care programs, such as KidCare and amilyCare.

- Illinois hospitals have fought for increased federal funds to help support the Illinois
Medicaid program.

0 Most Illinois hospitals reduce or write off bills for uninsured patients who are unable to
pay. Hospitals offer their indigent, uninsured patients discounts up tolOO percent of total
charges. Many uninsured patients pay little, if any, of the charges billed by the hospital
for the services they receive.

0 Illinois hospitals establish payment plans for uninsured patients who are able to pay.

Hospitals are committed to meeting the needs of everyone in their communities, including those
who cannot pay for their care. Individuals have an obligation to pay for the services they receive.
Similarly, hospitals have a duty to seek to? collect from patients who are able to pay.

The current regulatory environment, however, makes it dif?cult for hospitals to adopt more
compassionate charity care and collection practices for low-income, uninsured patients.
Confusing, cumbersome, and contradictory laws intended to prevent discrimination, overbilling,
and the provision of unnecessary care have hindered hospital efforts to fully respond to these
patients? concerns. For example:

0 Federal fraud and abuse laws Section 1128 of the federal Social Security Act)
expressly prohibit hospitals from routinely waiving or reducing many fees charged to

patients for care provided.

135

136

0 Medicare regulations require that all patients, regardless of ?nancial class, be assessed
the same charge for the same service. Severe federal penalties for non-compliance 
exclusion from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs) encourage
hospitals to strictly adhere to uniform charge schedules across all payer types.

0 Federal laws and regulations require hospitals to make ?reasonable? collection efforts
before they are allowed to write off any uncollected balance as ?uncompensated care or
to seek reimbursement from Medicare for ?bad debt.?

Federal laws and regulations have the unintended consequence of discouraging hospitals from
offering reduced-cost or free care to certain patients, such as the uninsured. A recent study by the
Commonwealth Fund, a private foundation that supports independent research on health and
social issues, concluded that existing federal laws and regulations often leave patients, especially
those without health insurance coverage, in signi?cant ?nancial debt.

IHA and MCHC will continue to collaborate with the American Hospital Association as it works
with federal regulators to clarify con?ising rules and regulations on this matter. In the meantime,
this report recommends steps that Illinois hospitals can take to ensure that their charity care

policies and collection practices are as patient-friendly as possible while complying with existing

regulations.

II. Charity Care Guidelines

Illinois hospitals are encouraged to review their current charity care policies and modify them so
that they are no more restrictive than the following guidelines. Nothing in these guidelines is
intended to limit or discourage a hospital from adopting a policy that is more liberal. Moreover,
these are general guidelines that each hospital should modify to meet its local needs and

circumstances.

Hospital Responsibilities

0 The hospital will have a charity care policy to evaluate and determine a patient?s eligibility
for ?nancial assistance. Charity care will be available for medically necessary hospital care
provided to persons who meet the ?nancial and documentation criteria de?ned in the policy.
Each situation will be reviewed independently and allowances will be made for extenuating
circumstances based on good faith efforts and mitigating factors.

0 The hospital will have a means of communicating the availability of charity care to all
patients. Examples of mechanisms that the hospital may use to do this include, but are not

limited to:

Placing signage, information, or brochures in appropriate areas of the hospital 
the emergency department, organized registration areas, and the business of?ce)
stating that the hOSpital offers charity care and describing how to obtain more
information about ?nancial assistance.

0 Using. languages that are appropriate for the hospital?s service area.

Patient Responsibilities

137

Placing a note on or with the hospital bill and statements regarding how to request
information about ?nancial assistance.

Designating departments or individuals who can explain the hospital?s charity care
policy.

Staff in the hospital?s patient ?nancial services and registration departments will understand
the hospital?s charity care policy and be able to direct questions regarding the policy to the
proper hospital representative. Hospital staff who regularly interact with patients will know
that the hospital has a charity care policy and be able to direct questions regarding the policy
to the proper hospital representative. An annual in?service is encouraged.

An uninsured patient will receive a full (100%) discount if he or she can demonstrate family
income at or below 100% of federal poverty guidelines, subject to income veri?cation

processes of the hospital and other hospital charity care eligibility requirements. Hospitals

are encouraged to offer a partial discount when an uninsured individual?s family income is
greater than 100% but equal to or less than 200% of federal poverty guidelines, and the
uninsured person meets other charity care eligibility requirements.

In determining whether a patient meets the eligibility criteria for charity care, a hospital may
consider the extent to which the person has assets other than income that could be used to

meet his or her ?nancial obligation.

Alter receiving the patient?s request for ?nancial assistance and any ?nancial information or
other documentation needed to determine eligibility for charity care, the hospital will notify
the patient of its eligibility determination within a reasonable period of time. The hospital
will also advise the patient of his or her responsibilities under these charity care guidelines.

The hospital?s use of federal poverty guidelines will be updated annually in conjunction with the
federal poverty guideline updates published by the United States Department of Health and Human

Services.

To be considered for a discount under the charity care policy, an uninsured person must cooperate -.
with the hospital to provide the information and documentation necessary to apply for other 
existing ?nancial resources that may be available to pay for his or her health care, such as
Medicare, Medicaid, KidCare, FamilyCare, third-party liability, etc. 

 

 

To be considered for a discount under the charity care policy, an uninsured person must provide
the hospital with ?nancial and other information needed to determine eligibility.

A request for ?nancial assistance under this policy must be made by or on behalf of the
patient. Patients may apply for, and will be encouraged to apply for, ?nancial assistance
before, during or within a reasonable time after hospital care is provided. In the event they do

138

not initially qualify for ?nancial assistance after providing the requested information and
documentation, patients may re-apply if there is a change in their income, assets, or family

size responsibility.

0 An uninsured patient who quali?es for a partial discount must cooperate with the hospital to
establish a reasonable payment plan, which takes into account available income and assets,

the amount of the discounted bill(s), and any prior payments.

0 Uninsured patients who qualify for partial discounts must make a good faith effort to honor
the payment plans for their discounted hospital bills. They are responsible for communicating
to the hospital any change in their ?nancial situation that may impact their ability to pay their
discounted hospital bills or to honor the provisions of their payment plans.

Collection Practices Guidelines For Charity Care Patients

Illinois hospitals are encouraged to review their current collection practices and modify them so
that they are consistent with the following guidelines. Nothing in these guidelines is intended to
limit or discourage a hospital ?om applying these guidelines to a broader group of patients
through an expansion of its charity care eligibility criteria. Moreover, these are general
guidelines that each hospital may modify to meet its local needs and circumstances.

These collection practices apply to outstanding bills from uninsured patients who qualify for a
partial discount under the hospital?s charity care policy (hereinafter referred to as a charity care
patient). Generally these are individuals whose family income is between 100% and 200% of the
Federal Poverty Guidelines, and who meet other charity care eligibility requirements outlined by
the hospital. The following collection practices also apply to external collection agencies
engaged by the hospital to assist with obtaining payment on outstanding bills ?'om charity care
patients who are granted partial discounts.

Hospital Responsibilities

0 When a patient has been approved under the hospital?s charity care policy for a partial
discount, the hospital will work with the patient or responsible party to establish a reasonable
payment plan, which takes into account available income and assets, the amount of the
discounted bill(s), and any prior payments. The hospital will also advise the patient of his or
her responsibilities under these collection practices guidelines.

0 Hospitals may offer prompt payment discounts to charity care patients who are eligible for
partial discounts on their hospital bills.

0 The hospital will not pursue legal action for non-payment of bills against charity care patients
who have clearly demonstrated that they have neither suf?cient income nor assets to meet

their ?nancial obligations.

I Legal action, including the garnishment of wages, may be taken by the hospital to enforce the
terms of the payment plan when there is evidence that the charity care patient or 
party has suf?cient income and/or assets to meet his or her obligation.

139

0 The hospital will not place a lien on a charity care patient?s primary residence if this is the

patient?s sole real asset unless the value of the property clearly indicates an ability to assume
signi?cant ?nancial obligations. The hospital will not execute a lien by forcmg the sale or
foreclosure of a charity care patient?s primary residence to pay for an outstanding medical

bill.

The hospital will not use body attachment to require the charity care patient or responsible
party to appear in court. 7

The hospital will ensure that the guidelines outlined above are followed by any external.
collection agency engaged to assist in obtaining payment on outstanding bills ?'om charity

care patients.

Patient Responsibilities

To receive favorable treatment under the collection practices described above, the uninsured
patient must have quali?ed for a partial discount under the hospital?s charity care policy by
having provided the ?nancial information and other documentation needed to deterrnine

eligibility for such a discount.

To receive favorable treatment under the collection practices described above, charity care
patients or their responsible parties must cooperate with the hospital to establish a reasonable
payment plan, which takes into account available income and assets, the amount of the

discounted bill(s), and any prior payments.

To receive favorable treatment under the collection practices described above, charity care
patients must make a good faith effort to honor the payment plans for their discounted
hospital bills. They are responsible for communicating to the hospital any change in their
financial situation that may impact their ability to pay their discounted hospital bills or to
honor the provisions of their payment plans.
