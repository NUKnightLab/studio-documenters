Report from Chief Quality Officer
A. Regulatory and Accreditation Updates (Attachment #1)
Dr. Krishna Das, Chief Quality Officer, provided an overview of the presentation regarding the Regulatory
Update. The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
During the discussion of the information on Slide 5, regarding correction plans, Director Lerner noted that
those listed are predominantly structural initiatives; the Board would be interested in learning more about
the process or execution initiatives associated with the correction plans. Board Chairman Hammock
inquired further regarding those responsible for the corrections and how the correction process is managed.
Dr. Das stated that the leaders in each area are ultimately responsible for the correction. There is a group
of people overseeing the whole process, but the actual correction itself is being devised by the leaders; in
addition, input from the front-line staff in each of these areas is included. She added that The Joint
Commission requires that the name of the person who is ultimately responsible for each correction be
provided when the corrections are submitted.

Report from Chief Quality Officer (continued)
B. Metrics (Attachment #2)
Dr. Das reviewed the presentation on Metrics. The Committee discussed the information.
With regard to the subject of the metrics planned for next year, Director Lerner recommended that the
metrics relating to Operating Room efficiency remain as a part of the Committee’s monthly review.
In response to a question regarding whether the data lag can be reduced to thirty (30) days, Dr. Das stated
that, currently, the data lag is approximately forty-five (45) days; the discharge data with the billing codes
comes in at the thirty (30) day point, so it may be a bit challenging to reduce it. She added that she will look
into the matter to see if the lag can be reduced.
