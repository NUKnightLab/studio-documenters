to and from school, at any school-related event, on any vehicle funded by CPS (such as a school bus),
and whileusing the CPS network.1

The 300 also applies to student behavior outside of school if: (1) a student engages in a Group 5 or 6
behavior, and (2) the behavior disrupts or may disrupt the educational process or orderly operation of the
school. This includes seriously inappropriate behavior on social networking websites that disrupts or may
disrupt the educational process or orderly operation of the school.

To address inappropriate behavior, school administrators must comply with the Guidelines for E?ective
Discipline which shall be issued by the Of?ce of Social Emotional Learning. At a minimum, a principal
or his/her designee must:

1) Redirect to correct behavior. All adults should redirect students to correct inappropriate behavior
and minimize the likelihood of the behavior escalating or recurring.

2) Intervene to minimize disruption, resolve con?ict, and as necessary to keep students and staff safe.
If a student has been injured, make every reasonable effort to immediately notify the


3) Gather information by talking to all students, teachers, school staff, or other witnesses to the
incident. When student misbehavior is reported to the school principal or designee, an investigation
must begin no later than the next school day. If a search of the student, his/her locker, desk, or
personal belongings needs to be conducted, follow the Boards Search and Seizure Policy
identify factors that may have contributed to the
incident and seek to understand the full context.

4) Analyze whether the student's alleged behavior falls within the SCC using the information gathered.
If so, determine the Group level of disruptiOn caused by the inappropriate behavior, identify the
inappropriate behavior listed, and consider the range of possible interventions and consequences.

5) Discuss with the student and provide the opportunity to explain hisl'her actions.

a) Inform the student of the inapprOpriate behavior slhe may have exhibited, the applicable SCC
behavior category, and the range of possible interventions and consequences.

b) Allow the student to respond and explain his/her actions.

c) Make reasonable efforts to contact the parents/guardians and discuss the incident with them
before assigning interventions and consequences.

d) No student shall be sent home before the end of the school day uniess the school has
established contact with the student's parent/guardian and provided written notice of a
suspension.

6) Make a determination and assign interventions or consequences according to the SCC.

a) Determine whether it is more likely than not that the student engaged in the identi?ed SCC
inappropriate behavior and the intervention or consequence most likely to address the cause of
the behavior.

b) The principal or designee has the ?nal authority to assign interventions and consequences based
on his/her independent assessment of the best interest of the school community, including
available school resources, the needs of any student or staff harmed, and the rights of the
student engaged in inappropriate behavior, in alignment with the 800.

c) Follow the special procedures contained in the Procedural Safeguards section for students with
disabilities and students with Section 504 Plans.

d) Avoid consequences that will remove the student from class or school, if possible. Use out-of-
school suspensions as a last resort and only when interventions and
consequences are insuf?cient to address the student's inappropriate behavior.

POLICE NOTIFICATION GUIDELINES

School administrators contact the Chicago Police Department (CPD) in two situations: (1) to seek
assistance with an emergency situation, or (2) to notify law enforcement of a criminal act.

Emergency
School administrators have the responsibility to call 9-1-1 in situations they determine to be emergencies.

In an emergency situation. administrators must make reasonable efforts to notify parents/guardians
immediately after contacting CPD.

Criminal Acts

When a student engages in illegal activity, it may be necessary for school staff to report the act to CPD.
In this situation, school of?cials contact CPD to report violations of the law. School of?cials must not
contact CPD merely to request removal of a disruptive student from the school in a non-emergency
situation.

In a non?emergency situation, administrators must make reasonable efforts to contact 
prior to contacting CPD.

The inappropriate behaviors that are clear violations of criminal law are identi?ed in the next section with
an asterisk before the speci?c inappropriate behavior. The inappropriate behaviors that may be
violations of criminal law are identi?ed in the next section with a double asterisk before the speci?c
inappropriate behavior.

School of?cials must assess the situation before determining whether or not to contact CPD to report a
criminal act. School of?cials should consider factors including:

. Whether the student distributed or was in possession of illegal drugs, narcotics, controlled
substances, or ?Iook~alikes" of such substances. If so, CPD must be noti?ed.
Whether the student was in possession of a ?nearm.2 If so, CPD must be noti?ed.
The severity of the criminal violation and the degree of harm to the school community,
Whether a person was physically injured as a result of the student's conduct,
Whether the student presents an imminent danger to the health. safety, or welfare of others, and
The student's age. For a student in ?fth (5th) grade or below, school staff must consult with the
Law Department (773/553-1700) prior to reporting the act to CPD.

Once school staff members contact CPD, the responding police of?cers ultimately will determine whether
or not to investigate, arrest, and/or take any other steps in response. School principals and staff do not
have the authority to decide whether a student will be arrested. Moreover, responding police of?cers do
not have the authority to decide whether a student will receive interventions or consequences at school.
The school principal will use the SCC to determine the appropriate intervention(s) andlor consequence(s)
to address a student's behavior.

STUDENT BEHAVIORS COVERED BY THE SCC

This section identi?es the speci?c inappropriate behaviors for which students will receive interventions
and/or consequences. The behaviors are listed in six different groups, according to the degree of
disruption to the learning environment.
. Group 1 lists behaviors that are inappropriate.
Group 2 lists behaviors that disrupt.
Group 3 lists behaviors that seriously disrupt.
Group 4 lists behaviors that very seriously disrupt.
Group 5 lists behaviors that most seriously disrupt.
Group 6 lists behaviors that are illegal and most seriously disrupt.

Special Notes:

individual School Rules and Academic 

Individual schools may develop school rules that are consistent with this SCC and may address
inappropriate student behaviors not speci?cally included in this SCC. However, poor academic
achievement is not an inappropriate behavior. The SCC and school rules may not be used to discipline
students for poor academic progress or failure to complete in-class and homework assignments. Instead,
struggling students should be considered for academic or behavioral interventions to help them improve.
Also, students must not be disciplined for the refusal to consent to the administration
of medication.

Cellular Phones and Other lnforrnation Technolmy Devices3
A principal may allow students to possess cellular phones or other information technology devices by

creating a school policy identifying when the items may be authorized, used, and how they must be kept.
A principal may also prohibit cellular phones and other information technology devices but allow individual
students to possess them for any good cause after considering a written request from a parent/guardian.
lf a principal denies a parent/guardians request, the parent may appeal to the Network Chief or his/her
designee. Unless approved by the principal, cellular phones and other information technology devices
are not allowed at school.

School Dress Codes and Uniform Policies

Local School Councils may adopt a dress code policy that forbids students from wearing certain items or
a uniform policy that requires students to wear a speci?c uniform. Dress codes and uniform policies
should be gender-neutral. Students who fail to follow a school's dress code or uniform policy may be
given detentions or excluded from extracurricular activities, but may not be barred from attending class.
A student may receive additional consequences for violating a school's dress code or uniform policy if the
student's dress disrupts or may disrupt the educational process. For example, a student may receive a
consequence for wearing clothing or accessories that display gang af?liation. This paragraph does not
apply to students enrolled in Military Academies or JROTC Programs.

Military and JROTC 
Board-designated military academies and other JROTC programs may enforce standards of conduct and

intervention or consequences that are consistent with the military nature of those schools and programs,
in addition to the standards of conduct and intervention or consequences described in this SCC.
Students enrolled in a military academy who repeatedly engage in acts of gross misconduct or
insubordination (student act that de?es a lawful and appropriate direct order of a superior ranked of?cer,
staff member or another student), or who repeatedly fail or refuse to wear the required military uniform,
may be subject to administrative transfer by the military academy principal to another school (or in the
case of a JROTC program, dismissal from the program). Prior to an administrative transfer, a conference

July 22, 2015

must be held with the parents/guardians, student, military academy principal, and a designee of the Chief
Executive Of?cer. Students who have been transferred for administrative reasons from any military
academy must be accepted by their attendance area school. Students who have been given an
administrative transfer to another Chicago public school or expelled from the Chicago Public Schools lose
all rank and privileges at the JROTC military academies and must reapply to the JROTC program and the
military academies for enrollment. Upon their child?s enrollment at a military academy, 
shall be informed of the uniform policy, expectations of the military academy, and the administrative
transfer policy, and shall indicate by signature their agreement to adhere to the terms of these policies.

Dating Violence Statement
Any school employee who is noti?ed by a parent, guardian or student, or who reasonably suspects, that a

student has been the victim of dating violence shall immediately report that information to the
pnncipalldesignee. Dating violence includes violent and controlling behavior that an individual uses
against a girlfriend or boyfriend, such as physical, emotional, or sexual abuse, yelling, threats, name-
calling, threats of suicide, obsessive phone calling or text messaging, extreme jealousy, possessiveness,
and stalking. School staff shall and reasonably investigate allegations of dating violence and
issue appropriate discipline based on their findings. The principal shall ensure that the student victim of
dating violence receives appropriate support services in accordance with the Board's Policy on Domestic
Violence, Dating Violence and Court Orders of Protection, . Restraint or No Contact


SCC and Other Laws, Policies, Rules, and Contracts
The inappropriate behaviors and range of possible consequences and interventions listed in this policy

are consistent with the illinois School Code, Board Rules and Policies, negotiated agreements, and all
other applicable state and federal laws.

The SCC applies to CPS contract and performance schools.

CPS charter schools are exempt from local school board policies under Illinois law (105 ILCS 
Charter schools may choose to adopt the SCC or establish their own discipline policies. Charter schools
are not exempt from federal and most state laws, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) or_
from federal and state regulations as they pertain to discipline of students with disabilities/impairments. If
a charter school establishes its own discipline policy, it must incorporate language from and comply with
the guidelines for suspension and expulsion of students with disabilities/impairments outlined in this
policy. Charter schools must also comply with policies and procedures established by the Of?ce of
Diverse Learner Supports and Services for the discipline of students with disabilities. Students expelled
from charter schools should contact the Department of Student Adjudication at 773/553-2249 for
assistance.

Corporal punishment is expressly prohibited. Chicago Board of Education Rule 6-21 states: ?No
employee of the Board of Education may in?ict corporal punishment of any kind upon persons attending
the public schools of the City of Chicago.?

ANTI-BULLYENG POLICY

Purgge
The General Assembly has found that a safe and civil school environment is necessary for

students to learn and achieve and that bullying causes physical, and-emotional harm to
students and interferes with their ability to learn and participate in school activities. Bullying has been
linked to other forms of antisocial behavior, such as vandalism, shoplifting, skipping and dropping out of
school, ?ghting, using drugs and alcohol, sexual harassment, and violence. It is the goal of the Chicago
Board of Education (?Board?) to create a learning environment in all its school communities where
students are protected from bullying so they feel safe and supported in their efforts to succeed
academically and develop emotionally into responsible, can'ng individuals.

The Board asks every Chicago Public School student, with the support of his/her parent(s),
guardian(s) and the adults at school, to commit to the following principles, which will apply to everyone on
school property and at school-related activities:

I I will not bully others.

- i will try to help anyone i suspect is being bullied.

- I will work to include students who are left out.

- if someone is being bullied, I will tell an adult at school and an adult at home.

Scope
Bullying is contrary to law and this Policy is consistent with the Illinois School Code. This Policy

protects CPS students against bullying and harassment on the basis of actual or perceived race, color,
religion, sex, national origin, ancestry, age, marital status, physical or mental disability, military status,
sexual orientation, gender-related identity or expression, unfavorable discharge from military service,
association with a person or group with one or more of the aforementioned actual or perceived
characteristics, or any other distinguishing characteristic. The Board recognizes the particular vulnerability
of students with actual or perceived disabilities and those who identify as or are perceived to be lesbian,
gay, bisexual or transgender. Nothing in this Policy is intended to infringe upon any expression protected
by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution or Section 3 of Article of the Illinois
Constitution.

This Policy is based on the engagement of a range of school stakeholders, including Students and
parents/guardians. The Board or its designee will re-evaluate this Policy every two (2) years based on an
assessment of its outcomes and effectiveness, including, but not limited to, factors such as the frequency
of victimization; student, staff and family observations of safety at school; identi?cation of areas of a
school where bullying occurs; the types of bullying utilized; and bystander intervention or participation.
The information developed will be made available On the District?s website.

Bullying is prohibited:

(1) during any school-sponsored or school-sanctioned program or activity;

(2) in school, on school property, on school buses or other Board-provided transportation, and at
designated locations for students to wait for buses and other Board?provided transportation ("bus
stops?);

(3) through the trans'miSsion of information from a CPS computer or computer network, or other electronic
school equipment;

(4) when communicated through any electronic technology or personal electronic device while on school
property, on school buses or other Board-provided transportation, at bus stops, and at school?
sponsored or schooi~sanctioned events or activities; 

(5) when it is conveyed that a threat will be carried out in a school setting, including threats made outside
school hours with intent to carry them out during any school-related or sponsored program or activity
or on Board-provided tranSporlation;

(6) when it is a Student Code of Conduct Group 5 or 6 behavior that occurs off campus but most
seriously disrupts any student?s education.

De?nitions

"Bullying? means any severe or pervasive (repeated over time) physical or verbal act or conduct,

including communications made in writing or electronically, directed toward a student or students, that

has or can be reasonably predicted to have one or more of the following effects:

(1) placing the student in reasonable fear of harm to the student's person or property;

(2) causing a substantially detrimental effect on the student's physical or mental health;

(3) substantially interfering with the student's academic performance; or

(4) substantially interfering with the student?s ability to participate in or bene?t from the services, activities,
or privileges provided by a school.

Bullying may take various forms, including without limitation, one or more of the following: harassment,
threats, intimidation, stalking, physical violence, sexual harassment, sexual violence, theft, public
humiliation, destruction of property, or retaliation for asserting or alleging an act of bullying. This list is
meant to be illustrative and non-exhaustive.

Bullying behaviors may also qualify as other inappropriate behaviors listed in the 800. When deciding
whether inappropriate behavior constitutes bullying, administrators should consider the student's intent,
the frequency or recurrence of the inappropriate behavior, and whether there are power imbalances
between the students involved. While bullying is often characterized by repeated acts, sometimes a
single incident constitutes bullying depending on the student?s intent and power imbalances.

?Cyberbullying? means using information and communication technologies to bully. This de?nition
includes cyberbullying by means of technology that is not owned, leased, or used by the school district
when an administrator or teacher receives a report that bullying through this means has occurred. This
Policy does not require a district or school to staff or monitor any nonschool?reiated activity, function, or
program.

?Retaliation" means any form of intimidation, reprisal including but not limited to the submission of
knowingly false bullying allegations, or harassment directed against a student who reports bullying,
provides information during an investigation, or witnesses or has reliable information about bullying.
Retaliation is prohibited and will result in the imposition of appropriate interventionslconsequences
according to this Policy and the SCC.

"Peer Con?ict? means disagreements and oppositional interactions that are situational, immediate and
developmentally appropriate. When school employees are aware of peer con?ict, they are expected to
guide students in developing new skills in social competency, learning personal boundaries and
peaceably resolving con?ict, and to model appropriate social interactions. These interventions are
designed to prevent Peer Con?ict from escalating to Bullying.

?Restorative Measures? means a continuum of school-based alternatives to exclusionary discipline that
are adapted to the particular needs of the school and community, contribute to maintaining school safety,
protect the integrity of a positive and productive learning climate, teach students the personal and
interpersonal skills they will need to be successful in school and society, serve to build and restore
relationships among students, families. schools, and communities, and reduce the likelihood of future
disruption by balancing accountability with an understanding of students' behavioral health needs.

lntervening to Address Bullying
Resmnsibilities of CPS Employees and Contractors

All CPS employees and contractors, including security of?cers, lunchroom staff and bus drivers, who

witness incidents of bullying or school violence or who possess reliable information that would lead a

reasonable person to suspect that a person is a target of bullying, must:

(1) intervene immediately in a manner that is appropriate to the context and ensures the safety of all
people involved;

23

50

July 22, 2015

(2) report the incident of bullying or retaliation to the Principal/Designee as soon as practicabie, but within
24 hours, on the CPS Builying Complaint Form (AttachmentA); and

(3) cooperate fully in any investigation of the incident and?in implementing any safety plan established by
the Principal/Designee.

Responsibilities of Students, Parents and Guardians
No student who witnesses buiiying may stand by or participate in the bullying, but must notify an adult at

school and an adult at home as quickly as practicable. Any parent or-guardian who witnesses or is
noti?ed of bullying has an obligation to advise the PrincipallDesignee as quickly as practicable. Reports
can be made to any CPS employee or contractor in person, by completing AttachmentA and submitting it
to the Principal/Designee, by calling the CPS Violence Prevention Hotline (?Hotline?) at 1-888-881-0606,
or by emailing BuliyingReport@cps.edu. Anonymous reports will be accepted by the PrincipailDesignee
and Hotline. No discipiinary action will be taken on the sole basis of an anonymous report.

investigation
(1) The Principal shall select a designee, knowledgeable about bullying prevention and intervention, to

perform the investigation.

(2) investigation of a bullying incident shatl be initiated within ?ve school days of receipt of a report and
completed within 10 school days, unless the Principai grants in writing an additional 5-day extension
due to extenuating circumstances. The Principal] Designee shall document the extension in the
investigation report and shall notify the parties involved.

(3) The investigation shall include:

a. Identifying the perpetrator(s), target(s) and bystander(s), as well as any adult who witnessed the
incident or may have reiiable information about it.

b. Conducting an individual interview in a private setting with the alleged perpetrator and target.
The alleged perpetrator and target should never be interviewed together or in public. individual
interviews shall also be conducted in private with student and adult bystanders.

c. Determining how often the conduct occurred, any past incident or continuing pattern of behavior,
and whether the target's education was affected.

d. Assessing the individual and school-wide effects of the incident relating to safety, and assigning
school staff to create and implement a safety plan that will restore a sense of safety for the target
and other students who have been impacted.

e. When appropriate preparing a Misconduct Report identifying his/her recommendation for
individual consequences.

f. Comprehensiveiy documenting the details of the investigation.

(4) When the investigation is complete the PrincipalIDesignee shall ensure the investigation report is
attached to the incident Report' In 

Noti?cation

On the same day the investigation is initiated, the PrincipallDesignee shall report to the parent/legal
guardian of all involved students, via telephone. personal conference and/or in writing, the occurrence of
any alleged incident of bullying, and shall document these noti?cations in the incident Report in 
When the investigation is complete, the PrincipaifDesignee shalt notify the guardians of all
students involved of the outcome of the inVestigation. Parentsliegal guardians of the students who are
parties to the investigation may request a personal conference with the Principal/Designee to discuss the
investigation, the ?ndings of the investigation, the actions taken to address the reported incident of
bullying. and any resources available in or outside the school to help the students address the underlying
reasons for the bullying (see "Referrals? section below). .

If the investigation results in the imposition of consequences, the PrincipalIDesignee may advise the
parent/legal guardian of students other than the perpetrator that the Student Code of Conduct was

followed. Slhe may not advise them of the speci?c consequence imposed, as that would violate the
con?dentiality of school-record information required by law.

When communicating incidents of bullying to the target's parentlguardian, the Principal/Designee should
consider whether the student may want to keep certain information con?dential. For example, if a student

24

51

July 22, 2015

is bullied after coming out as gay, the Principal/Designee shall not disclose the student?s sexual
orientation to the parentlguardian without the student's permission, unless there is a iegitimate, school-
reiated reason for doing so.

If the target is a student with a disability, the school shall convene the Team to. determine whether
additional or different special education or related services are needed to address the student?s individual
needs and revise the accordingly. For example, if the student?s disability affects social skifl
development or makes the student vulnerable to bullying, the Principal/Designee shall ask the student?s
Team to consider whether the should include provisions to develop the student?s skills and
pro?ciencies to avoid and respond to bullying.

If the student who engaged in bullying behavior is a student with a disability, the school shall convene the
IEP Team to determine if additional supports and services are needed to address the inappropriate
behavior and consider examining the environment in which the bullying occurred to determine if changes
to the environment are warranted. For example, the Team should consider a behavior intervention
plan for the student or review a current behavior intervention plan and revise if necessary. The
Principal/Designee shall comply with the Procedural Safeguards for Discipline of Students with
Disabilities/impairments when considering interventions and consequences for students with disabilities.

Assigning Interventions and/or Conseguences

Many Peer Con?icts can be resolved immediately and do not require reporting or creation of a
Misconduct or Incident Report. if, however, a con?ict is ongoing and meets the de?nition of bullying, the
investigation procedures in this Policy must be 

Schools must respond to bullying in a manner tailored to the individuai incident, considering the nature of
the behavior, the developmental age of the student, and the student?s history of problem behaviors and
performance. Appropriate responses and consequences are outlined in the Student Code of
Conduct. Schools should avoid using punitive discipline (detention, suspensions, and expulsions) if any
other method or consequence can be used with ?delity. Contact the Of?ce of Social Emotional Learning
for school?wide prevention practices and the CPS Law Department for more information about the
appropriate and legal cdnsequences for student misconduct.

When an investigation determines that bullying occurred, the Principal/Designee shali explain the

consequences in a non- hostile manner, and shall impose any consequence immediately and consistently.

The PrincipailDesignee shall keep communicating and working with all parties involved until the situation

is resoived. Some key indicators of resolution include.

-The perpetrator' Is no longer builying and is interacting civilly with the target.

-The target reports feeling safe and is interacting civilly with the perpetrator. -

-Schooi staff notice an increase in positive behavior and social-emotional competency in the perpetrator
and/or the target.

-School staff notice a more positive climate in the areas where buliying incidents were high.

What Not To Do:

Solicit an apology frOm the perpetrator to the target, use peace circles, victin?rloffender conferences, or
any form of mediation that puts the perpetrator and target in contact with one another in an immediate
attempt to resolve the bullying. Restorative measures may be helpful to repair relationships between the
perpetrator and target, but only if used after other interventions have balanced the power differential
between the perpetrator and target.

-Dismiss bullying as typical student behavior or assume it is not serious.

Referrals

interventions with bullies should not focus on feelings, but changing thinking. The Principal/Designee may
refer students who bully to positive-behavior small-group interventions (for anger management, trauma or

social skills), social work, counseling or school services within the school, if necessary, to
reinforce the behavioral expectation they violated and increase their social-emotional competency.

25

52

July 22, 2015

The targets of bullying need protection from bullies, but may also need support and help in changing their
own behavior. The Principal/Designee shall ask a school mental health professional to refer these
students to individual or group therapy where they can openly express their feelings about their bullying
experience, social?skills training andr'or groups where they can practice assertiveness and coping
mechanisms, or social work, counseling or school services availabie within the school. For
more information, see Guidelines for Effective 

Aggeal

Any party who is not satis?ed with the outcome of the investigation may appeal to the CPS Equal
Opportunity Compliance Of?ce, or EOCO (telephone: within 15 calendar days of
noti?cation of the Principal?s decision. The EOCO Administrator shall render a ?nal determination in
accordance with the timeline and procedures set out in the anti-bullying appeal guidelines established by
the E000. The EOCO may return the incident to the Network Chief, Principal or their designees for
further investigation or reconsideration of the consequence(s), direct the imposition of other
consequence(s), or deny the appeal. The EOCO shall notify the party requesting the appeal and the
Principal that its decision is ?nal and shall document that notification in the incident Report in IMPACT.

Conseguences for CPS Emgioyeeg and Contractors

When it is determined that an employee or contractor was aware that bullying was taking place but failed
to report it, the employee/contractor will be considered to have violated this Policy. The Principal shall 
consider empioyee discipline for such violations, making reference to any applicable collective bargaining
agreement. Remedies for offending contractors should be imposed according to their Board contracts.

Notice and Dissemination of Reguirements
Principals shall follow the requirements established by the Of?ce of Social Emotional Leaming for

posting this Anti?Builying Policy on the school's Website, in the school building as well as disseminating
and presenting this Policy to school staff as part of pre-school-year professional development.

Training and Professional Develogment

Staff

Professional development will be offered to build the skills of all CPS employees contractors and

volunteers to impiement this Policy. The content of such professional development shall include, but not

be limited to:

(1) Developmentally appropriate strategies to prevent incidents of bullying and to intervene immediately
and effectively to stop them;

(2) Information about the complex interaction and power differential that can take place between and
among a perpetrator, target, and witness to the bultying;

(3) Research ?ndings on bullying, including information about speci?c categories of students who have
been shown to be particularly at risk, and any speci?c interventions that may be particularly effective
for addressing bias-based bullying; and

(4) Information about internet safety issues as they relate to cyberbullying.

Student Internet Safety Education
In accordance with the Board's Internet Safety Policy each

school shall incorporate into the school curriculum a component on Internet safety to be taught at least
once each school year to all students. The Chief Of?cer of Teaching and Learning or designee, shall
determine the scope and duration of this unit of instruction and topics covered. At a minimum, the unit of
instruction shall address: safety on the Internet; appropriate behavior while online, on sociai
networking Web sites, and in chat rooms; and cyberbullying awareness and response. The age-
appropriate unit of instruction may be incorporated into the current courses of study regulariy taught.

PROCEDURAL SAFEGUARDS FOR DISCIPLINE OF STUDENTS WITH
DISABILITIESIIMPAIRMENTS

School of?cials may suspend students with disabilities?mpairments and cease educational services for a
total of up to 10 consecutive or 10 cumulative school days in one school year without providing
procedural safeguards. Saturday, and before- and after-school detentions do not count toward the 10-
day limit. Additionally, if students with disabilities continue to participate in the general education
curriculum, continue to receive their IEP services, and continue to participate with non?disabled peers to
the same extent as speci?ed in the lEPs, in-school suspensions and lunch detentions do not count toward
the 10-day limit. Administrators are not required to suspend students with disabilities for the
recommended periods set forth in this Code fora'single incident. Speci?cally, the Principal or his/her
designee has discretion to suspend students with disabilities fewer days than set forth for a single
incident.? Federal regulations offer some ?exibility in suspending students with disabilities in excess of-10
school days in the school year in certain circumstances. In order to determine whether the circumstances
permit a suspension in excess of 10 days per school year, consultation by the school with the Department
of Procedural Safeguards and Parental Supports (773/553?1905) is absolutely necessary. Without such
consultation and approval from the Department of Procedural Safeguards and Parental Supports,
the 10 school day limit on out of school suspensions will continue to apply.

When school of?cials anticipate a referral for expulsion, including referrals requesting emergency
assignment pursuant to the CPS SCC, the following apply:

1. School must provide written notice to the parentlguardian or surrogate parent of the request
for an expulsion hearing and the date of an Individualized Education Program (IEP)
Manifestation Determination Review (MDR) meeting, which must be held within 10 school
days of the date of the decision to request the expulsion hearing. School must also provide
parentlguardianfsurrogate with a written copy of the Notice of Procedural Safeguards.

2. The IEP team must:

A. Determine whether the misconduct is related to the student?s disability by reviewing all
current and relevant information, including evaluation and diagnostic results, information
from the parent/guardian, observations of the student, and the student's The
behavior is a manifestation of the student?s disability if:

1) the conduct in question was caused by the student?s disability or has a direct and
substantial relationship to the student's disability; and/or

2) the conduct in question was the direct result of the school?s failure to implement the
student?s IEP. 

3. Review, and revise if necessary, the student?s existing behavior intervention plan or
develop a functional behavior assessment and behavior intervention plan to
address the misconduct. The behavior intervention plan must address the misconduct for
which the student is being disciplined.

if the student?s behavior is not a manifestation of the disability, school of?cials may apply the SCC, taking
into consideration the student?s special education and disciplinary records. In no event, however, may
the student be suspended for more than 10 consecutive or cumulative school days in a school year
without providing appropriate educational services.

If the' student's behavior is a manifestation of the disability, a disciplinary change in placement (expulsion)
cannot occur. Students with disabilities, even if expelled, must be provided with an appropriate education
in an altemative educational setting. 

All MDRs are subject to legal review by the Department of Procedural Safeguards and Parental Supports.

 

3? All procedural safeguards contained in the $00 and this Appendix are equally applicable to those students with ?504 plans.
