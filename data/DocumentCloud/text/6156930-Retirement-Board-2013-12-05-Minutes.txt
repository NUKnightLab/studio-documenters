2. Administrative Report
a. Purchase Authorization
Ms. Nickol R. Hackett, stated that the Fund was seeking authorization to purchase one (1)
color and one (1) black and white printer from Chicago Office Technology Group
(“COTG”). The new color printer would supplement the current Canon printer and the new
black and white printer would replace the Kyocera printer that is eight years old. The current
printers are aging and have increasing maintenance issues. Ms. Hackett stated that the Board
had previously given the Fund authority to lease two printers, but the Fund staff could not
negotiate acceptable lease terms. COTG had agreed to sell two printers to the Fund for a total
of $18,000 if the sale could be closed before the year-end. The Fund staff determined that
purchasing two printers as proposed, rather than leasing them, would result in an estimated
savings of $27,840 to the Fund over five years.
It was moved by Trustee McFadden and seconded by Trustee Richrdson that the Fund may
purchase one (1) color Xerox printer and one (1) black and white Xerox printer from the
COTG at a combined cost not to exceed $18,000 and that the Fund staff is authorized to take
all action reasonably necessary to effectuate the foregoing including the execution and
delivery of related agreements on behalf of the Fund by the Executive Director

mostly compromised of member’s files and approximately 7,000 of such files have been reviewed
and prepared for scanning by utilizing temporary staff. Mr. Cholewa reported that for 2014, the Fund
planned prepare to implement a workflow process utilizing the new system. In 2015, documents

costs and increase security. They also discussed how the recent amendment to the Pension Code
allowing the Fund to maintain electronic copies as original records would be coordinated with DMS
and the Local Records Act. The trustees recommended more frequent updates on the status of the
project be made to the Board.

enhancements, health strategy implementation, member outreach, as well as policy and
operational reviews. Ms. Hackett further reported that the 2014 budget proposal represents

improvements, and advisory services.
