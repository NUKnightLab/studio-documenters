Public Comments
No comments were made at this meeting.
Executive Director’s Report
Ms. Grace Gallucci asked RAC members to assist NOACA in advocating for the Irishtown Bend
project, which involves replacing the bulkheads that are deteriorating and falling into Cuyahoga
River. She noted that if repairs are not made, it would prevent companies from shipping and there
would be a $3 billion annual economic loss. She said NOACA is trying to be proactive by getting
the bulkheads fixed now.
Ms. Gallucci mentioned that NOACA submitted an INFRA Grant application requesting $15.7
million for the Irishtown Bend project. She noted that the application has been placed on
Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao’s desk for consideration.
Ms. Gallucci stated that a grassroots effort is being made to get funding for the Irishtown Bend
project. She named several elected officials who have either contacted Secretary Chao or are
planning to contact her about this project. Ms. Gallucci informed RAC members that they will
receive a fact sheet with links to contacts and a report that explains Irishtown Bend’s impact on
communities in the region. She asked members to share the information with legislators and
constituents in their communities.
Ms. Kress asked if staff’s request is time sensitive. Ms. Gallucci said yes and noted that a decision
will be made on the application in a couple of weeks. Ms. Gallucci noted that businesses in
Northeast Ohio may be directly or indirectly impacted by the $3 billion economic loss.
NOACA Geauga County Build Project Update
Ms. Kate Moening stated that the Geauga County Amish Safety project was developed as a result
of the 2015 strategic safety plan that identified rural safety improvements for motorists, Amish
buggies, and pedestrians. Ms. Moening mentioned that NOACA was awarded a $9.6 million
8273c
1-1

 BUILD Grant for the project that has a total cost of $14.3 million. She said NOACA is providing
$1.5 million in Transportation Alternatives Program (TAP) funds that was approved by the Board
in June 2019. Ms. Gallucci explained how TAP funds can be used.
Ms. Moening stated that the project includes widened shoulders, warning and detection signal
systems, and signage improvements for motorists and pedestrians. The current activities include
an approach for project administration, project programmed with completed funding, the
consultant selected to perform preliminary development and detailed design services, and the
draft US DOT BUILD project agreement.
Ms. Moening presented the following schedule for the project:

Ms. Moening stated that NOACA staff will continue to inform RAC throughout the project
development and implementation.
Mr. Oros asked if pedestrian facilities will be looked at for the end product. Ms. Moening stated
that she was not aware of specific details, but heard there will be a buffer for pedestrian activity,
additional signage, probably youth education for pedestrians, and rectangular rapid flashing
beacons (RRFBs) for crossings at non-intersection areas.
Mr. Oros asked if the project is still in the design phase. Ms. Moening said yes.
Geauga County FPA – Prescriptions for Wastewater Treatment Modification in Chardon
Township
Mr. Eric Akin provided background on the 208 Plan and the Geauga County FPA modification
request approved by the Board in June. He noted that the request involves the transfer of 124
parcels (141 acres) and a prescription change in Chardon Township from “no sewer service” to
“may be sewered.”
Mr. Akin reviewed the affected area, wastewater timeline issue, sewage system summary,
notification requirement, and analysis. He mentioned that NOACA staff submitted the FPA update
to Ohio EPA for certification by the Governor and transmitted copies of the resolution to the
appropriate federal, state and local agencies.
Ms. Cotman asked how the project is funded. Mr. Akin stated that there will be an assessment of
each property of $25,000-$30,000 that will probably be paid over 20-30 years with the property
tax. The homeowner will have to pay an upfront cost of $200 to the county for connection.
Ms. Christin Brandon asked if the lot size of the adjourning properties was looked at for failing
septic systems or just the lots identified in the request.
Mr. Akin stated that the subdivision mentioned in this request has small lots and the houses on
the lots were built in the 1950s and 1960s, while the neighboring subdivision has large lots and
8273c

 the houses were built in the 1980s and 1990s. Mr. Akin stated that if there was an issue with the
neighboring subdivision, a request would have to be submitted to NOACA to allow for connection.
Coordinated Public Transit-Human Services Transportation Plan for Northeast Ohio
Ms. Sarah White provided background on the Coordinated Plan; discussed the public outreach
that was done; talked about how feedback was gathered from various sources and goals were
developed for the future and strategies for implementation. She mentioned that NOACA is the
designated recipient of FTA Section 5310 program funds for the Cleveland Urbanized Area (UZA).
Currently, NOACA directs at least 60% of the funds to transit agencies and up to 40% of the funds
to other specialized transportation providers. She noted that NOACA will use the Coordinated
Plan as an evaluation tool to prioritize Section 5310 funding and guide current and future regional
needs.
Ms. White mentioned that the NOACA Board of Directors approved Mobilize: Accessibility for
Independence as the Coordinated Public Transit-Human Services Transportation Plan for
Northeast Ohio for the years 2019-2022.
Mr. Tim Stahlberg asked if the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority (GCRTA) was
involved in the public outreach. Ms. White said yes.
Ms. Kress asked if NOACA’s goal is to provide services to areas currently not being served in the
region. Ms. White stated that NOACA wants to keep exploring coordination efforts. Ms. White
talked about the Senior Transportation Connection working with GCRTA.
Ms. Gallucci stated that the Coordinated Plan is intended to fill transportation gaps. She noted
that some communities have applied for funding through NOACA so they can purchase a van to
transport seniors and individuals with disabilities. She stated that the Coordinated Plan applies
to many cases in rural areas.

•
•
•

Roles and responsibilities
Leadership
Organizational structure
Communications, advocacy, public engagement and efforts to build stronger stakeholders
relationships

Ms. Render provided an overview of the platform NOACA is looking to create. She asked RAC
members if they were willing to develop a working committee to assist NOACA with devising a
plan of action and discuss how the council can help NOACA connect to the rural community;
discuss areas of growing the rural economy and leverage transportation networks to markets and
farms; provide direction to facilitate ongoing engagements; and elevate NOACA’s position and
priorities.
Ms. Render stated that the working committee could have a brainstorming session at NOACA
offices or members could participate via conference call. She noted that the goals are to have a
purpose, leverage NOACA’s network, maintain ongoing communication, provide guidance and
support, bridge new ideas and strategic initiatives, and provide a stronger link with both local and
national communities.
Ms. Render stated that building relationships to support legislative needs will help NOACA deliver
its mission and strategic plans to its network and create opportunities for partnerships. She
mentioned that there are no financial impacts. She stated that the next steps involve staff setting
up a working meeting in July-October; creating an agenda for RAC discussions; leveraging a
network/introducing a detailed plan in September; and having ongoing communications / an event
to support the agenda / plan.
Mr. Oros stated that the Farm Bureau plays a big role in rural communities and would be a good
stakeholder group to speak to about transportation needs and agritourism.
Ms. Kress suggested that NOACA staff contact the Ohio Township Association, Coalition of Large
Ohio Urban Townships (CLOUT), and Ohio State University Extension.
Ms. Gallucci stated that the working committee will give RAC members an opportunity to think
about how to advance the needs of NOACA; how NOACA can meet the needs of the rural
communities; and provide RAC members an opportunity to provide suggestions on how NOACA
can do a better job.
Ms. Kress asked if RAC members will receive some information. She suggested that staff find
out the best time to contact trustees who may have another job and look at the network’s strengths
and weaknesses. Ms. Render stated that staff would be willing to visit the communities.
Ms. Kress suggested that RAC members think about the best places to hold meetings in their
communities.

MEMORANDUM
TO:

NOACA Rural Advisory Council

FROM:

Grace Gallucci, Executive Director

DATE:

November 27, 2019

RE:

Planning Reviews (PPRs)/ Intergovernmental Review and Consultation (IGRC); 3rd
Quarter State Fiscal Year 2020

ACTION REQUESTED
No action is requested at this time. This item is for information and presentation only.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION
Attached are PPR summary documents for the proposed project to be presented to the NOACA
Transportation Subcommittee, Planning and Programming Committee and Executive Committee for review
and recommendation.
NOACA’s Board approved Regional Transportation Investment Policy requires that all proposed federal-aid
transportation projects be processed through PPR in order to meet NOACA’s adopted goals and federal
requirements.
PPR consists of four levels of review: NOACA staff; Board, including committees, subcommittees, and
councils: intergovernmental review and consultation (IGRC); and public involvement. The end product of
PPR is a Board resolution that certifies that the project has had thorough review, allowing the project to
proceed to the programming stages of the planning process.
As part of the PPR process, a detailed summary of the proposed improvement and staff and committee
assessment of the project are posted on NOACA’s website, www.NOACA.org. A link to the PPRs is
included on the home page by clicking the ‘Comment on Projects’ button. Staff adds comments obtained
from the public, governmental organizations and NOACA committees as they are received. Proposed
projects are posted on the website for three months, allowing adequate time for review and comment.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Pending Board approval, the project sponsor will be notified that their project has completed PPR. NOACA
staff will work with the project sponsor to address any planning issues identified during PPR.

Attachments: Project Summary

Improvements along Cleveland Avenue in Elyria
Title: Improvements along Cleveland Avenue in Elyria
Sponsor: City of Elyria
Estimated Total Cost: $7,206,891
Proposed Source of Federal Funds: ODOT and NOACA
History/Background: The Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) Safety program provides
funds to ODOT and local governments for highway safety treatments or corrective activity
designed to alleviate a safety problem or a potentially hazardous situation. The program is
funded at approximately $100 million annually. Priority is given to those projects with
recommended activities/countermeasures that improve safety at roadway locations with a high
frequency, severity, and rate of crashes.
There are two application cycles per year. Applications must be signed off by the respective
ODOT District Safety Review Team. A safety engineering study must typically accompany the
application unless the application is for preliminary engineering funds to complete the study.
The following project was selected for Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP) funding.
The NOACA Board of Directors adopted Resolution 2019-045 approving the projects to be
funded with NOACA administered Surface Transportation Block Grant (STBG) funding and
STBG set-asides for Transportation Alternatives Projects (TAP) for the state fiscal year (SFY)
2021 – 2024 Transportation Improvement Program. The projects recommended for NOACA
funding included rehabilitation of Cleveland Street, in the City of Elyria.
Proposed Project: LOR CR-658 - 00.00 (CLEVELAND ST): PID No. 110986 - This project
involves rehabilitation along Cleveland Street, from East Bridge Street and Gulf Road to
Hawthorne Street in Elyria (maps and illustrations). The work will include full and partial depth
pavement repair, resurfacing, replacement of curbs, deteriorated culverts and roadway drainage
catch basins, and installation of a roadway underdrain system and conduit. The City will also
implement a road diet, reducing the number of lanes along Cleveland Avenue, from four (4)
through lanes to three (3) lanes (one lane in each direction and a center turn lane).
According to the sponsor, the number of curb cuts will be minimized, access point locations will
be controlled and bicycle lanes will be possible. The project will also include crosswalks, ADA
(Americans with Disabilities) ramps, intersection improvements, new sidewalk, lighting and the
creation of bicycle lanes. The project will also include pavement markings, signage and the
replacement of the traffic signal at the intersection of Olive Street and possibly Gulf Road. Traffic
calming measures will also be considered with the project including curb bump-outs and
contrasting pavements. The project will also involve improvements to the intersection at East
Bridge Street/Cleveland Street with four-leg non-circular roundabout.
The STBG funding is dedicated to the roadway rehabilitation component of the project. The HSIP
funding is dedicated to the road diet and roundabout components of the project.
The project’s estimated total cost is $7,206,891. The estimated cost of preliminary engineering
preliminary development (PEPD) is $352,952. The estimated cost of preliminary engineering
detailed design (PEDD) is $173,842. The estimated cost of right-of-way (RW) is $300,000. The
PEPD, PEDD and RW will be funded with HSIP funds ($744,115) and local funds ($82,679). The
estimated cost of construction (CO) is $5,900,097. The CO will be funded with STBG funds
($3,329,686), HSIP funds ($1,255,885) and local funds ($1,314,527). The estimated cost of
construction engineering (CE) is $480,000. The CE will be locally funded.

 Staff Comment (Summary):
RECOMMENDATION:
o A transition for the bike lane into the roundabout should be provided, such as wide
sidewalks/shared use paths and signage for bike traffic moving through the roundabout
intersection.
o Consider utilizing ladder-style crosswalk markings across Cleveland Street, in addition to
the contrasting pavement. The visual contrast of a differing pavement type tends to fade
over time, and ladder-style markings would maintain the safety benefit of a high-visibility
crosswalk. (Example: see West 25th Street and Detroit Avenue intersection crosswalks).
o Consider utilizing the center turn lane to create median refuge islands to improve the
safety of crosswalks along the corridor. Median refuge islands are an FHWA Proven
Safety Countermeasure.
o The work summarized in this PPR will occur within two subwatersheds: 1) Black River
Mainstem and Jackson Ditch-East Branch Black River. According to Ohio EPA’s 2018
Integrated Report (IR) Watershed Assessment Unit (WAU) summary, sampling results
along the Black River Mainstems subwatershed indicate that the river is in full and partial
attainment of its Aquatic Life Uses (ALUs). The WAU lists the causes of impairment as
due to nutrients and conductivity modifications associated with municipal point source
discharges. According to the 2018 IR WAUs, the Jackson Ditch-East Branch Black River
subwatershed's sampling sites are in full, partial and nonattainment due to
sedimentation/siltation due to natural causes (Black River falls) NOACA staff
recommends that ODOT maintain stormwater runoff on-site for as long as possible to
keep nonpoint source pollutants from reaching the Black River. NOACA staff also
recommends that ODOT consider incorporating habitat restoration along the river
wherever possible.

RE:

Transportation for Livable Communities Initiative (TLCI) Update

ACTION REQUESTED
No action is requested at this time. This item is included for information and discussion only.
BACKGROUND
NOACA's Transportation for Livable Communities Initiative (TLCI) Program provides assistance to
communities for integrated transportation and land use planning and projects that strengthen community
livability. TLCI advances the goals of NOACA’s Regional Strategic Plan by:
• Developing transportation projects that provide more travel options
• Promoting reinvestment in underutilized or vacant/abandoned properties
• Supporting economic development
• Ensuring that the benefits of growth and change are available to all members of a community
• Enhancing regional cohesion
• Providing people with safe and reliable transportation choices
The TLCI Program has two components: The TLCI Planning Studies Program and the TLCI Implementation
Program. The TLCI Planning Studies Program assists communities to develop transportation planning studies
that facilitate and promote sustainable development, multimodal transportation, and complete and green
streets. The TLCI Implementation Program provides funding assistance for communities to implement priority
projects identified in TLCI or TLCI-like community developed plans.
This year NOACA is soliciting applications for its Planning Study program that promote regional
benefit. Applications for community-based planning studies that do not provide a larger regional benefit
are not considered to be eligible. Examples of studies that provide a regional benefit and that are being
considered this round by NOACA are:
• Downtown Cleveland Transportation Connectivity Study
• Regional Metroparks Trails/Transportation Connections Study
• Regional Lakefront Transportation Connections Study
An application round was opened for both planning studies and implementation projects on August 29, 2019.
On October 11, 2019, NOACA received 20 requests for funding: 4 planning study requests totaling about
$476,000 in funding and 16 implementation project requests totaling about $4.8 million in funding. NOACA’s

5 - 13

 anticipated three regional planning study projects total $700,000 in funding. All requests are being evaluated
based on the criteria established in the TLCI Policy. Projects requested for both the planning studies and
implementation projects are attached.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is $2 million in available funding for the 2020 TLCI program. The TLCI program is funded by an annual
set aside from NOACA’s Surface Transportation Block Grant (STBG) funds during the development of
NOACA’s annual Overall Work Program and biennial Transportation Improvement Program.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Input received from the Council will be incorporated into the application evaluations.

RE:

Membership Expansion of Advisory Councils

ACTION REQUESTED
No action is requested at this time. This item is included for information and discussion only.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION FOR CURRENT ACTION
The Governance Committee recently discussed expanding the membership of the Advisory Councils to
include emerging future leaders, which will advance the Charter count from 15 to 18 members.
The purpose of expanding the membership count to the Councils will allow emerging professionals
opportunities to help advance and reinforce NOACA’s mission and agenda. The inclusion of emerging
future leaders is expected to help spark new ideas, approaches and perspectives for growing NOACA’s
stakeholder and community connections, especially targeting specific messages to other future leaders.
The request includes the expansion of three seats for each council. The future leaders will help the Council
build and enhance relationships with various government agencies and subdivisions, the media and
general public. NOACA advisory councils, whose make-up of business representatives, the general public
and large groups affected by transportation decisions, could better inform the Committee’s
recommendations to the NOACA Board of Directors and enhance NOACA’s advocacy on infrastructurerelated and environmental issues.
The Councils help monitor community reactions to agency policy, proposals, and progress early in the
planning process, and supplement the public involvement activities that NOACA staff performs. The
Council also assist the External Affairs Committee in developing agency policies for outreach to the
public, business and rural communities.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact at this time.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
The External Affairs Committee and NOACA staff will recruit members for each advisory council and
establish meeting schedules.

RE:

SAVE: NOACA’s Plan for Transportation Safety

ACTION REQUESTED
No action is requested at this time. This item is for information and presentation only.
BACKGROUND
NOACA has recently completed SAVE Plan; NOACA’s Plan for Transportation Safety. The purpose of the
SAVE Plan is to save lives in the NOACA region by identifying actions to reduce the most severe crashes
that too often result in fatalities and serious injuries. The SAVE Plan was developed with the vision that traffic
deaths and injuries can be prevented with appropriate planning, policies and programs, with a long-term goal
of reducing the number of fatalities and serious injuries by 50% by the year 2040. The SAVE Plan provides
direction that will enable NOACA and others to work together to set goals and work toward the vision this
Plan establishes for the region.
Achieving a safer transportation network requires addressing the interaction among the infrastructure,
vehicles and the skill and behavior of travelers. The SAVE Plan incorporates a “6 E’s” approach into the safety
planning process, acknowledging the key roles that engineering, education, enforcement, emergency
response, evaluation, and equity all play in preventing severe crashes and saving lives. After evaluating 10
years of crash data to identify trends, ten emphasis areas associated with fatal and serious injury crashes
were identified.

At the meeting, the presentation will provide more detail about the Plan. The full Plan is available on NOACA’s
website at this link.
In order to influence emphasis areas closely associated with driver behavior, the Ohio Traffic Safety Office
(OTSO) and ODOT work together to develop a rolling calendar of safety campaign messaging to raise public
awareness on specific emphasis areas and initiatives promoted by the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration (NHTSA). Typically these campaigns involve messaging pushed out via social media and
press releases, supported with messaging by ODOT on freeway message boards, and often coupled with
increased enforcement. The full OTSO safety calendar may be viewed on their website at this link.
NOACA encourages local public safety partners to be aware of broad safety campaign messaging and to use
campaign materials provided by Traffic Safety Marketing and ODOT (including the “Your Move” campaign) to
educate and encourage road users in their jurisdictions to obey traffic laws and practice safer behaviors.
Continuing support of education and outreach programs is necessary to make and continue positive changes
in behavior of the traveling public. At the national level, significant reductions have been made in reducing
the rate of fatalities for unbelted motorists (reduced from 54% to 48% between 2007 to 2016) and alcoholimpaired driving fatalities (reduced from 32% to 28% between 2007 to 2016); however, both emphasis areas
still comprise a large fraction of all crash fatalities. (Source: Terry Shelton, Associate Administrator, National
Center for Statistics and Analysis, “2016 Fatal Crash Overview” presented on December 14, 2017.)
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
NOACA will develop and support key initiatives in partnership with other organizations to advance safe
projects and to encourage safer traveler behavior. Agencies within the NOACA region are encouraged to
assist the Ohio Traffic Safety Office with maximizing impact of statewide message campaigns by crosspromoting these messages at the community level.
