1.

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would
require an infusion of funds in order to meet current obligations? What was
the balance in the account on that date, and what was the balance 30 days
prior to that date?
On September 20, 2010, it became apparent that the receiving accounts
required funds. The accounts 530-530 and 530-549 were was not funded in
the FY 2010 budget; therefore the balances were was zero throughout FY
2010.

2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified?
List any other accounts that were also considered (but not used) as the
source of the transferred funds.
Funds allocated in account 530-441 will not be totally expended because the
computer system is presently being serviced internally and no longer by the
vendor who initially had the proprietary interest in the system.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations
that will be deferred, delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in
available spending authority that will result in the account that funds are
transferred from.
None.

4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this
account was originally budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated
surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
At the time the FY 2010 budget was developed, this computer equipment
was in place and budgeted for maintenance consistent with prior years.
Thereafter, the agency learned that the vendor could no longer support the
system. Subsequent to the passage of the FY 2010 budget, the Board of
Commissioners authorized the purchase of a new system for which a new
line item and funding was identified.
