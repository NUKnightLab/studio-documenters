Legislative Updates – Tobacco 21
Since May of 2018, CCBH has been working with the City of Euclid to develop a template to
operationalize, spread and scale Tobacco 21 in Cuyahoga County. At that time, Euclid City Council
passed a resolution in support of Tobacco 21 (T21) and additional components including permitting,
enforcement, appeals, hearings and other related matters have been in development over the last year to
create a template for Euclid and other communities in the health district to follow.
T21 raises the age to purchase tobacco products (cigarettes, e-cigarettes, cigars, nicotine products) to
21. Only 5% of people start smoking after age 21. Only 2% of tobacco product sales are to kids aged
18-21 but this age group drives 90% of the addiction as they share their tobacco products with younger
children.
We’re happy to report that on August 20th, CCBH presented the City of Euclid with a resolution from
the Board demonstrating our appreciation for their support of T21. Subsequently, Euclid City Council
unanimously approved the template that we created in collaboration with the Mayor, her staff and City
Council.

We are now in dialogue with the City of Cleveland Heights on T21 and will keep the board posted as
we move forward.
