Funding Source: General Fund
Jeanelle Greene, Department of Information Technology, presented. Dale Miller commented on the
importance and need for third-party assurance testing on the accounts payable module and asked why
the evaluation was not part of the original scope of services as this is a major testing area. Ms. Greene
indicated she would research and provide a response to the Board members. Nan Baker asked for

Funding Source: General Fund
Jerad Zibritosky, Nora Hurley and Jonathan McGory, Department of Law and Jeremy Mio, Department of
Information Technology, presented. Lenora Lockett indicated that the vendor has not yet completed
registration with the Inspector General’s Office and that this item will need to be approved conditionally
if the Board approves the contract.
Trevor McAleer asked for confirmation on the number of e-mails to be reviewed and for clarification on
how the software will process these e-mails; asked what the temporary attorneys will be working on once
the e-mails have been uploaded.

 Nan Baker asked about the period of time the software will be in use and if the County is paying additional
costs due to the urgency of this purchase; and asked if $20,000 for the 3-month period is considered
excessive.
Dale Miller asked for clarification on the correlation between the decreased number of e-mails to be
reviewed to the decreased volume of gigabytes of data to be downloaded as they did not seem to be
aligned; asked for confirmation that while the volume of e-mails declined, the content could potentially
be of substance which explains the variance between the two figures.
Trevor McAleer asked for clarification on the types of e-mails to be reviewed and whether it will only
include those flagged as attorney-client privileged or related to FMLA matters; asked for clarification that
5 of the 6 mailboxes will be reviewed based only on select search terms and asked if all non-privileged
communications will need review.
Maggie Keenan indicated that all e-mails must be reviewed to determine if privilege applies.
Mr. McAleer asked how privileged communication is determined; stated that his original understanding
would be segregating those requiring review from those that do not.
Jonathan McGory indicated search terms were not available at the time of original request and now that
those search terms have been provided, a more refined search will be conducted on the 5 mailboxes for
privileged or HIPPA-related matters; said that the Department of Information Technology was instructed
to not segregate the 5 mailboxes since all will need to be reviewed, which should expedite the process.
Nan Baker asked for clarification as to whether this software purchase had been requested in the original
contract for temporary attorney services or did the department expect to come back to request this
software purchase.
Maggie Keenan indicated that the prior request to contract for temporary attorney services did not
include the cost of software, which is why the cost of that service was relatively inexpensive and that the
procurement of software began after that approval.
Ms. Baker asked if this software will provide any efficiencies that would expedite the process and reduce
the amount of services required of the attorneys; asked if the deadline remains March 18 and is the
department prepared to request an extension of time, in the event that is needed; recommended to
proactively request a time extension and asked for clarification on the number of extensions already
requested.
Mr. McAleer asked if we are paying more for the software by purchasing separately from attorney
services.
Maggie Keenan motioned to approve the item; Michael Dever seconded. Item BC2019-162 was
conditionally approved by unanimous vote.

 BC2019-163
Fiscal Office/Board of Revision, recommending an award on RQ44430 and enter into a contract with GPI
Enterprises, Inc. in the amount not-to-exceed $24,999.00 for temporary staffing services for the period
3/1/2019 – 6/30/2019.

Shelley Davis, Board of Revision, presented. Dale Miller commented on a prior amendment to the Charter
that provides the benefit of greater operational flexibility and opportunities for temporary employment,
so the Board of Revision may operate more efficiently. Maggie Keenan motioned to approve the item;
Dale Miller seconded. Item BC2019-163 was unanimously approved.
BC2019-164
Department of Human Resources, submitting an amendment to Contract No. CE1700057 for the Wellness
Program for County employees for the period 4/1/2017 – 12/31/2019, to change the name of the provider
from Viverae, Inc. to Simplywell, Inc., effective 3/4/2019 and for additional funds in the amount not-toexceed $2,000.00.
Funding Source: Self-Insurance Fund – Wellness
Holly Woods, Department of Human Resources, presented. Dale Miller asked if Simplywell, Inc. will be
undergoing another name change. Nan Baker asked why the rates did not remain the same as under the
original contract and asked whether the rates would have remained the same if Viverae, Inc. had not been
bought out; recommended that consideration be given, that the vendor increased rates in the middle of
the contract term which expires at the end of the year, when contracting for the next Wellness Program.
Dale Miller asked if biometric screenings for employees have been scheduled for this year. Maggie Keenan
asked if there are plans to issue a Request for Proposals at the end of this contract term. Maggie Keenan
motioned to approve the item; Dale Miller seconded. Item BC2019-164 was unanimously approved.
BC2019-165
Department of Human Resources,
a) Submitting an RFP exemption on RQ44582, which will result in an award recommendation to W.B.
Mason Co., Inc. in the amount not-to-exceed $1,670.92 for the purchase of supplies for Worker’s

12/10/2018.
Funding Source: Workers’ Compensation
Holly Woods, Department of Human Resources, presented. Nan Baker asked why invoices from August,
2018 are now just being presented for approval and asked if additional invoices are still outstanding.
Maggie Keenan asked if these items were purchased without appropriate authorization, as existing policy
states that these items could not be paid by office voucher. Lenora Lockett clarified that the W.B. Mason
contract is strictly for the purchase of office supplies, which these items were not; stated that in
preparation for the Enterprise Resource Planning Project, the County is basically preparing departments
for all items that may have been processed but not in the preferred method; said that office vouchers are
for purchases $500 and below for the year, per vendor. Angie Rich concurred with Ms. Lockett and said

 these invoices should not have been held but rather quotes should have been sought through an informal
bid and presented to the Board for approval prior to purchase. Maggie Keenan commented that there
seems to be a reoccurring issue of purchases being made using public dollars without legal authority and
said that procurement processes and controls are in place for a reason. Maggie Keenan motioned to
approve the item; Trevor McAleer seconded. Item BC2019-165 was unanimously approved.
BC2019-166
Department of Public Safety and Justice Services, recommending an award on RQ43705 and enter into a

BC2019-167

BC2019-169
Cuyahoga County Sheriff’s Department,

all County Jail medical facilities for the period 3/4/2019 – 12/31/2019.

Funding Source: General Fund
Donna Kaleal, Sheriff’s Department, presented. Trevor McAleer asked if this contract will provide
sufficient staffing until the transition of services to MetroHealth is complete; and asked how the pricing
compares to the current temporary nursing services contract; Ms. Kaleal indicated that she will research
and provide a response to the Board members. Mr. McAleer asked if we have utilized Educare staffing
services to capacity.
Nan Baker asked if communications between MetroHealth and the County can be improved upon to
anticipate future staffing needs.
Maggie Keenan commented that maintaining staffing is dependent upon the number of nurses on staff,
as it is anticipated that County nurses will be leaving their jobs that will need to be backfilled by contracted
workers, as the transition gets closer and as County employees continue to attrition out; said that it is
difficult to determine how many staff will call off at any time, as well as covering vacation time of workers,
which creates the on-going issue of predicting staffing needs; said that staffing levels will continue to be
monitored weekly but it’s difficult to forecast the staffing needs months from now.
Nan Baker asked if additional temporary services will be needed at the end of the year due to contract
negotiations with the nurses’ 5-year contract that will be ending.
Ms. Keenan stated that the department should have a sense as to their needs by 4th quarter and if the
need is unclear by July, the department will proceed with an amendment for additional funding.
Trevor McAleer said there is an effort to incentivize the existing County nurses to stay through the
transition but it is best to have a contract in place, if necessary; said that the agreement should be crafted
and presented in the next 4-6 weeks which should give a clearer picture on future nursing needs.
Maggie Keenan motioned to approve the item; Trevor McAleer seconded. Item BC2019-169 was
unanimously approved, as amended.

 BC2019-170

Jeanelle Greene, Department of Information Technology, presented.
Dale Miller asked if this amount is deducted from the Enterprise Resource Planning Project Contingency
Fund. Maggie Keenan asked if this software is used for creating reports. Trevor McAleer asked if only
analysts in the Office of Budget and Management will require licensing or will other agencies’ Business
Managers need access also; and asked if we will eventually need additional licenses.
Ms. Keenan commented that anyone can go into the system to complete ad hoc reporting tasks and does
not anticipate the need for additional licenses for all users as these 10 licenses are for use in preparing
fixed reports by the Office of Budget and Management.
Dale Miller motioned to amend the agenda to consider the item; Trevor McAleer seconded. Maggie
Keenan motioned to approve the item; Dale Miller seconded; Item BC2019-180 was unanimously
approved.
