have been submitted for your information.

 PROPOSED RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners has adopted a Real Property
Assessment Classification 8 that provides an applicant a reduction in the assessment

WHEREAS, the County Board of Commissioners has received and reviewed an

for an abandoned commercial facility located at 14441-45 South Cicero Avenue,
Midlothian, Cook County, Illinois, Property Index Number 28-10-108-035-0000; and
WHEREAS, Class 8 requires the validation by the County Board of the shortened period

for less than 24 consecutive months upon purchase; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners has determined that the building
was abandoned for 12 months at the time of application, and that special circumstances

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the President and Board of

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the County Clerk is hereby authorized and directed

*Referred to the Business & Economic Development Committee 06/07/05.
Commissioner Gorman stated that she is concerned with the type of businesses; auto parts and
computer retail that Pulaski Partners is trying to put into the strip mall which there are many
retailers already established in the same type of business.
Commissioner Murphy replied that she had spoken to the Village President of Midlothian, Thomas
J. Murawski regarding the new retail shops that Pulaski Partners is brings in, and he is in favor of
the project and feels that the new retail shops will be viable for the Village of Midlothian.
Commissioner Claypool stated that he thinks it is not Cook County’s business to take tax dollars
to give an unfair competitive advantage to one business over another, which doesn’t help create
new jobs it simply shifts jobs from one subsidized retailer to one that is not subsidized over
time. Further, Commissioner Claypool stated that he questions as a good public policy whether
that is an appropriate thing to do, although the Ordinance may allow technically for the application
to be approved, the County does have the discretion to object the application.
Chairman Collins replied that she trusts that the local municipalities would be aware whether they
are putting a business out-of-business in order to create another business. Further, Chairman
Collins stated that once the application goes to the Assessor’s Office, the office looks at the
application to see if the new business stimulates the economy.

 Commissioner Maldonado pointed out that there are certain areas in the County that are
economically deprived, and some of the incentive programs to attract businesses into an area is
one of the few mechanisms that the County as to be able to attract businesses to some
areas. Further, Commissioner Maldonado suggested that a study should be done to see the
effect that the Classification Ordinance has had since it was originally approved in the late 70’s
or early 80’s, to assess the actual economic benefits that this type of incentive programs have
brought into the communities.

*Referred to the Business & Economic Development Committee 06/07/05.
Commissioner Gorman asked how many new jobs will be created.
Ryan Hesch, Partner, MLRP Realty Partners, replied that currently the facility is vacant and falls
under the two year abandonment clause and that is why MLRP Realty Partners are before the
Committee today. Further, Mr. Hesch stated that at this time he was not able to give the
Committee a direct answer, but that type of facility it lends itself to a light manufacturing
assembly which typically run a couple of shifts; and with that size of facility you can have from
twenty to potentially sixty to sixty-five jobs depending upon the number of shifts.
David Dweyer, Attorney, Amari & Locallo, stated that at this time MLRP Realty Partners
intentions are to get a light manufacturing tenant in the facility, but unfortunately without the
Class 6B it is not a viable opportunity and the deal will fall through and the building will remain
vacant. Mr. Dweyer, further stated that the only way MLRP Realty Partners can get a tenant
into the building at this time would be with the incentive, and at this time with the size of the
building and with the market as it is at this time MLRP Realty Partners is looking in creating
between thirty-five to sixty jobs once the building is fully occupied.
Mr. Dweyer stated that the building is in need of repairs and MLRP Realty Partners is looking to
spend $350,000 to $400,000 on repairing the building. In conclusion, Mr. Dweyer stated that
the final use of the building will be for industrial.
Commissioner Maldonado asked who will receive the incentive.
Commissioner Murphy asked if the Committee can hear from Jacquelyn Harder, Economic
Development Project Director, Department of Planning and Development.
Jacquelyn Harder replied that the incentive will go to the owner. Ms. Harder stated that with an
abandonment provision there has to be a purchase, or in another words a new owner. She
stated that MLRP Realty Partners is purchasing the building, which at this time it is abandon
and they intent to put in a manufacturing business that will be there tenant.
Chairman Collins asked whether the business will also qualify for tax incentives from the
County.
Ms. Harder replied that the owner would pass through the property tax benefit to the tenant.
Chairman Collins asked if this procedure was consistent with the County’s Ordinance and if had
ever been done.
Ms. Harder replied that it has been before, but at this time she does not have the actual
numbers. Further, Ms. Harder stated that the Ordinance requires a purchase of a building.

with full occupancy.
