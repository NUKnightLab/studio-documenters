Excused Absence: President Stroger (1)
Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Committee on Finance of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County met pursuant to notice on
Monday, May 15, 2006, at the hour of 10:00 A.M. in the Board Room, Room 569, County Building, 118
North Clark Street, Chicago, lllinois.
Chairman Daley informed the Committee that this meeting is for informational purposes only, to discuss
both the Revenue Report and the Trial Balance Report. He requested that Walter K. Knorr, Comptroller,
address the Committee.
Mr. Knorr presented the following overview of the Revenue Report and the Trial Balance Report:
The Revenue Report is four pages long, contains three exhibits, and runs through March 3 I, 2006.
Exhibit A summarizes the fi ve major revenue sources. Exhibit B provides detail for each individual
revenue item summarized for the four months. The last item provides detail relating to the revenue for
each of the four months. The last page is the basis of presentation for how this was put together; it is
integral to the Report.
For the first four months of 2006, revenues have been running net $16 million behind. As addressed in
Exhibit B, this results from a $23.5 million shortfall in patient fees which is partially offset by
approximately $8-9 million of revenue above expectation for the Sales and Cigarette Taxes. The
Cigarette Tax benefited from a floor audit perfonned by the Revenue Department with the assistance of
other personnel throughout the County. The Amusement Tax revenue was higher than expected, as a
result of collecting in Rosemont and up-front sales of White Sox tickets. That was offset by a slower pace
in the County Use Tax on big ticket items, which is expected to pick up as we move into summer.
Mr. Knorr further noted that the 2006 levy will not be collected until 2007. The fees currently collected
equal one-third of the revenues in the Budget, less patient fees and the Intergovernmental Transfer or
IGT. These fee projections are based on discussions with the Treasurer, the Recorder of Deeds, and the
Clerk of the Circuit Court. The figure for patient fees was prepared by the Bureau of Health Services, and
was derived from their historical cash flow. Regarding the IGT, which is the last fee item in Exhibit B, of
$I 80 million in revenue, $6.2 million is recognized. This is done in accordance with a state schedule and
the state 's cash flow; we do not expect to see another lGT item until August. Acceleration has been
requested from the state.

xlix

 Regarding home rule taxes, the Sales Tax was calculated on a historical basis; last year's actual was
inflated by three percent for the projection. $107 million was expected and $108.9 was received. There
was a very good March collection of the Sales Tax which represents the holiday sales. The Cigarette Tax
is up by $7 .6 million; this is due to the previously mentioned audit by the Revenue Department. The
Wheel Tax revenue will not be received until the summer, hence it was calculated historically. The
Cigarette Tax was projected based on $ 13 million per month for the first three months. This was based on
a figure that did not include the additional $1 levied this year.
Barbara Bruno, Director, Revenue Department, provided the following infonnation:
For April, after the Floor Tax, we received $16 million. That shows an increase of $7.6 million over
projections. We made approximately $ 13.5 million on the Floor Tax, compared with $ 15 million the last
time. Every time the tax is raised we suffer a decrease in revenue in the following month. Then,
revenues seem to bounce up a bit in ensuing months. For example, in May we've received $13.5 million
already. We should have received $20 million for every month after the increase. This has to be
monitored month-by-month.
Commissioner Quigley inquired how short the County will be this year in terms of patient revenues.
Alvin Holley, Chief Financial Officer, Bureau of Health Services, replied that five additional collection
personnel have been hired to work in the areas of Medicare and Public Aid. Federal payments are being
pursued. It is his expectation that they will remain on budget, and avoid a shortfall.
Commissioner Goslin inquired whether the 2006 budget took into account the $70 million in IGT funds
that the County will not be receiving.
Mr. Knorr replied in the affirmative.
Commissioner Hansen inquired what the date of impact wi ll be for the $50 million shortfall as a result of
decreasing federal appropriations.
Mr. Knorr replied that this would impact the County's 2007 Budget.
Commissioner Maldonado inquired whether the $23 million shortfall is due to the fact that the County has
been without contractors since January 31 as it pertains to third-party reimbursement collections,
especially Medicaid. He further inquired about the projected revenue for those months.
Mr. Holley replied that a lack of third party collection activity did result in declining patient revenue, and
specified that the projected uncollected revenue for those months totals $20 million.
Commissioner Maldonado requested that the Commissioners be made aware of all sources of additional
revenue that may be collected in the future.
Vice Chainnan Steele voiced her concern that the County needs to work more productively with its
federal lobbyist around the issue of the $50 million reduction in federal funds.
Mr. Knorr replied that he would be certain that the lobbyist is contacted on this issue, but it may be too
late to affect the present fiscal year.
Chainnan Daley voiced concern regarding whether patients fees incurred from February through April
could be recouped at this point in time.

 Mr. Holley replied that he is confident that some of these fees can be recouped.
Commissioner Murphy inquired as to what percentage of patients have third-party insurance.
Mr. Holley replied that fifty percent of patients have third-party insurance.
Commissioner Suffredin inquired whether the County is in a crisis or needs to consider short-tenn
borrowing.
Mr. Knorr replied in the negative to both questions.
Commissioner Suffredin inquired of Robert Benjamin, Communications Director, Treasurer's Office,
whether his Office has concerns regarding a shortfall at the end of the year.
Mr. Benjamin replied in the negative.
Commissioner Collins inquired how the law firm of Ungaretti & Harris, which the County has retained,
has helped to obtain revenue.
Dr. Daniel H. Winship, Chief, Bureau of Health Services, replied that this law fi rm has worked with
Congressional staff to provide the Bureau with valuable information regarding IGT and the national
Medicaid budget. He agreed to provide a report on this issue to the Commissioners.
Commissioner Gonnan inquired about collection of delinquent patient fees.
Mr. Holley replied that those accounts are now turned over to collection agencies, so there will be
revenue forthcoming.
Commissioner Sims inquired about collection of the most difficult patient bills, and what steps are taken
in these cases.
Mr. Holley replied that self-pay bills are the most difficult to collect, because many of the patients are
truly indigent; in these cases the hospital tries to help the patient obtain Medicaid or Medicare.
Commissioner Butler inquired as to the nature of the $20 million dollar advance.
Mr. Knorr replied that the State of Illinois had advanced $20 million from the 2007 Budget Year
Allocation to the 2006 Budget Allocation.
Commissioner Butler voiced concern that we are depleting our future health budget.
Commissioner Peraica inquired whether there is any uncertainty with regard to the IGT revenue stream.
Mr. Knorr replied in the negative, noting that there is a fixed schedule.
Commissioner Peraica inquired as to the status of the Foster Group online system installation.
Mr. Holley replied that it is ongoing.
Commissioner Peraica asked for confinnation that once this system is implemented, revenues in the range
of $600 million can be expected.

Ii

 Dr. Winship confirmed this.
Chairman Daley voiced his concern over a possible shortfall at the fiscal year's end. He next inquired of
Donna Dunnings, Director, Department of Budget and Management Services, how union contracts are
being funded in the event of changes in collective bargaining agreements.
Ms. Dunnings replied that reserves are held in anticipation of new collective bargaining agreements.
Commissioner Hansen requested that a report be obtained from Ungaretti & Harris regarding lobbying
activities.
Dr. Winship replied that he would obtain a report for the Commissioners on this matter.
Chairman Daley asked the Secretary to call on the following public speaker:
1. George Blakemore - Concerned Citizen

Appropriation Trial Balance and the Revenue Report for the period ending March 31, 2006. The

State ' s Attorney to engage the finn of Harris & Harris for a two year period to perform
accounts receivable collection services for delinquent fines and fees due and owing to the
Clerk' s Office. The goals of this initiative are to collect as much revenue as possible and
to bring past due accounts that are deemed uncollectible by an independent qualified fim1
to closure.
The collection services provided by Harris & Harris will be performed on a competitive
basis with no cost to Cook County. All fees associated with the collection of a past due
fine or fee will be added in addition to the fine or fee amount as pennitted by Illinois
Public Act 093-0836, which became law in 2004.
The scope of the collection services that Harris & Harris would be engaged to perform
would concentrate solely on past due Traffic fines and fees.
The horizon of time that will be addressed for the collection of past due fines and fees
will span in excess of ten (I 0) years.
Established in 1968, Harris & Harris has the resources necessary to perfonn collection
services for a court system the size of the Circuit Court of Cook County efficiently and
effectively, using state-of-the art technology as well as industry standard collection
procedures. The decision to select Harris & Harris for this engagement was predicated
on a due diligence review perfonned by the Clerk of the Circuit Court of several firms

submitting herewith a copy of the County's Comprehensive Annual Financial Report
(CAFR) for the fi scal year ended November 30, 2004, audited by Deloitte & Touche
LLP. I respectfully request that this report be forwarded to the Audit Committee of the

BUREAU OF FINANCE, by Thomas J. Glaser, Chief Financial Officer, transmitting a
Communication, dated February 17, 2006:
Subject:

Single Audit Report for the Fiscal Year Ended November 30, 2004

submitting herewith a copy of the County's Single Audit Report, applicable to our major
federal grant programs, for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2004, prepared by
Washington Pittman & McKeever, LLC. As part of this report, I am also including a
copy of the County's Basic Financial Statements for the fiscal year ended November 30,
2004 and Independent Auditors' Report. I respectfully request that these reports be
forwarded to the Audit Committee of the Board of Commissioners for further discussion.

*Referred to the Committee on Audit on March 1, 2006.
Vice Chairman Goslin, seconded by Commissioner Butler, moved to receive and file
Communication No. 276225 (Item No. 2). The motion carried.
3. 276226

BUREAU OF HEALTH SERVICES, by Daniel H. Winship, M.D., Chief, transmitting a
Communication, dated February 10, 2006:
This Jetter is to fonnally request that the Bureau of Health Services Audited Financial
Statements, related Management Letter, and request for Bad Debt write-off for fiscal year
2004 be forwarded to the Audit Committee of the Board of Commissioners for
discussion.

*Referred to the Committee on Audit on March 1, 2006.
Commissioner Hansen asked for clarification regarding Provident Hospital's 2003 Medicaid outpatient
charges that were denied.
Alvin Holley, Chief Financial Officer for the Bureau of Health Services clarified that the comments are
for the prior year (2003). He further stated that in 2003 , the Bureau of Health Services' computer
program did not contain editing functions that would have precluded staff from entering letters in lieu of
numbers. Once this function was enabled, and staff was trained, the number of errors decreased
significantly.

XCV

 Commissioner Hansen asked what the comparable figures are for 2004.
Mr. Holley replied that there are no comparable figures, because the auditors did not calculate a rejection
for 2004. The auditors stated that the recommendation was implemented.
Chairman Daley asked for a representative from Ernst & Young to respond to Commi ssioner Hansen's
question.
Kenneth R . Herlin, Partner, Ernst & Young responded that Ernst & Young examines all previous
recommendations to determine the status of implementation. For all recommendations that have been
implemented, Ernst & Young make a notation that the status is "current." If the recommendation has not
been implemented, it is carried forward. Mr. Herlin also noted that one of the goals is to ensure the
ma nagement team implements the prior year' s comments. Mr. Herlin concluded that the recommendation
regarding Provident's Medicaid rejection rate is not applicable for 2004.
Commissioner Hansen asked what the rejection rate is for 2004.
Mr. Herlin replied approximately 11 %, which is the industry average.
Mr. Ho lley stated that the prior year's comments on the management letter have been implemented for
Provident Hospital.
Commissioner Butler asked what the denial analysis showed.
Mr. Holley responded that the Bureau of Health Services looked at some of the rejected bills, and they
indicated there were alphabetic characters, which meant that it was entered into the computer incorrectly.
These were data entry errors that were easily corrected by enabling the editing function.
Commissioner Butler asked what other action was used to improve the denial rate.
Mr. Holley replied the staff was re-trained.

Vice Chairman Goslin, seconded by Commissioner Hansen, moved to receive and file
Communication No. 276226 (Item No. 3). The motion carried.
4. 276233

CLERK OF THE CIRCUIT COURT, Dorothy Brown, transmitting a Communication,
dated February 24, 2006:
submitting the fiscal year 2004 Independent Audit Report and Memorandum on Internal
Controls for the Office of the Clerk of the Circuit Court. I respectfully request that these

completed and deli vered to the County back in May 2005, and submitted for referral to
the Audit Committee via a receive and file letter submitted on Jul y 11 , 2005 for inclusion
on the September 8, 2005 Board Meeting Agenda. This item was not included among the
agenda items as requested. We were recently notified that this letter is necessary to have
the FY 2004 Audit Report and Memorandum on Internal Controls properly referred to the
Audit Committee.

 Vice Chairman Goslin, seconded by Commissioner Butler, moved to receive and file
Communication No. 276233 (Item No. 4). The motion carried.
5. 278223

BUREAU OF FINANCE, by Thomas J. Glaser, Chief Financial Officer, transmitting a
Communication, dated April 5, 2006:
Subject:

Cook County, Illinois - Memorandum on Internal Control Structure for Fiscal
Year Ended November 30, 2004

submitting herewith a copy of the County's "Memorandum on Internal Control" for fiscal
year ended November 30, 2004, prepared by Deloitte & Touche LLP. I am hereby
requesting that this item be referred to the Audit Committee for fu rther discussion.

*Referred to the Committee on Audit on April 18, 2006.
Commissioner Hansen referred to page 8 of the Management Letter, and inquired as to the status of the
two statements at the top of the page.
Walter K. Knorr, Cook County Comptroller, responded that in regards to the self-insurance fund he had
received a draft of a new actuarial report that he is currently examining. Mr. Knorr further stated that the
County will be speaking with insurance industry representati ves regarding options for funding the selfinsurance reserves.
Thomas J. Glaser, Chief Financial Officer, responded that the Bureau of Finance disagrees with the
auditors on this particular point. If the County chooses to use its bond capacity as a means of funding the
self-insurance fund, this is a valid decision the County has full authority to make.
Commissioner Hansen asked if the County is bonding any of the funds.
Mr. Glaser responded in the affirmative. Mr. Glaser further stated that in fisca l years 2002 and 2004, this
was done with taxable variable rate bonds.
Commissioner Hansen asked for the number of years the County is funding with bond proceeds.
Mr. Glaser replied the County has been financing the liabilities two years forward. The goal originally
was to develop a pool o f funds that would earn enough to be self-sustaining.
Commissioner Hansen asked why the auditors from Deloitte & Touche objected to thi s.
Michael N. Mayo, Partner, Deloitte & Touche LLP, responded there is no fonnal objection from Deloitte
& Touche regarding the use of bond proceeds to fund the self-insurance liabilities. The comment is to
consider another alternative for funding to relieve the County from long· term debt load.
Commissioner Hansen inquired as to the status of the Vendor Master File.
Mr. Knorr replied the audit of the Vendor Master File, which is referred to as the "Address Book" is in
progress. The idea is to eliminate the duplicate entry of a vendor that over the years has changed the
"remit to" address for mailing of the check. Additionally, a vendor may inadvertently have a number of
different vendor identification numbers, and the County would like to have all those duplications
eliminated.

XCVll

 Commissioner Hansen asked what is the status regarding the cashiering system in the Recorder of Deeds
Office.
Ray Wolverton, Director of Technical Services for the Recorder of Deeds Office, replied the Recorder of
Deeds Office had a problem obtaining a purchase order for the vendor. The vendor currently has the
purchase order, and the date for full integration was scheduled for March 31, 2006. As a result of the
vendor not receiving the purchase order until April, full integration has been rescheduled for June 30,
2006.
Commissioner Peraica asked whether the Recorder of Deeds Office is still manually maintaining two
systems for revenue reporting.
Mr. Wolverton replied the Recorder of Deeds Office was unable to interface with the County's JD
Edwards FMIS system, and switched to the ACCPAC, which is an accounting product.
Commissioner Peraica asked why the other county departments have no problem interfacing with the JD
Edwards system.
Mr. Wolverton responded the Recorder's Office has no problem interfacing with JD Edwards system on
payroll and purchasing products, but do not use the JD Edwards system for the cashiering portion.
Commissioner Peraica inquired whether the Comptroller's Office uses the JD Edwards system for their
accounting functions.
Mr. Knorr replied the JD Edwards system is used in the Comptroller's Officer.
Commissioner Peraica asked whether the Comptroller' s Office has experienced any problems with the JD
Edwards system's applications.
Mr. Knorr responded that the JD Edwards Systems does what it is intended to do.
Commissioner Peraica asked why the Recorder's Office is having difficulties.
Mr. Wolverton replied that it is not so much a difficulty, but in tenns of maintenance of the application on
a yearly basis it was more cost effective for the Recorder's Office to go with a lower end product to
accomplish the same task.
Chainnan Daley asked Catherine Maras O'Leary, Chief Information Officer of the Bureau of Infonnation
Technology and Automation, to address this issue.
Ms. Maras O ' Leary, Chief Information Officer, stated the JD Edwards system was purchased as part of a
Request for Proposal (RFP) six years ago, and there are twelve modules currently utilized county-wide.
The County has an enterprise license so that all departments and agencies can also utilize the system, if it
proves to be cost effective and efficient for their individual needs. The Recorder's Office determined it
was more cost effective to maintain and upgrade the current system they were utilizing (the ACCPAC
system), rather than implement the JD Edwards system.
Commissioner Peraica asked that the legal staff detennine the authority under which the Pension Board
has granted health insurance benefits to annuitants.

 Chainnan Daley replied that Mr. Glaser indicated that he is working with the State' s Attorney 's Office on
the matter.

months the Department of Environmental Control has developed all of the accounting manuals that are
listed on page 6, and all have been implemented.
Commissioner Hansen asked if the County Auditor has the accounting manuals.
Mr. Givens replied it was not requested that the Department of Environmental Control send the
documents to the County Auditor, but he will submit all relevant documents to the Auditor's Office.

Commissioner Hansen, seconded by Commissioner Butler, moved for the Audit Committee to

BOBBIE L. STEELE AND LARRY SUFFREDIN, COUNTY COMMISSIONERS
WHEREAS, the United States healthcare system is in a tenuous condition, particularly the networks that
serve as the safety net for the seemingly ever-increasing number of uninsured or underinsured citizens;
and
WHEREAS, approximately 46 million Americans are uninsured, including some 1.8 million in Illinois;
and
WHEREAS, roughly one in five families have at least one member who is not covered; and
WHEREAS, it is common for families to go without insurance at some point in their lives; and
WHEREAS, this crisis is caused by ever escalating healthcare costs that have reached double-digit
figures within the last five years, a rate of increase that is 2-3 times the rate of inflation, coupled with
federal budget cuts in Medicaid and Medicare, making it unlikely, if not impossible to offset losses in
employer-based insurance; and
WHEREAS, nationally, these budget cuts in Medicaid and Medicare, create more indigent citizens with
healthcare needs who tum to the public safety net, such as exists in Cook County, as their only recourse;
and
WHEREAS, the rapidly rising medical costs, along with more employers unable or unwilling to provide
medical benefits, are creating a great strain on the entire network, which as currently fonnulated, is
unsustainable; and
WHEREAS, the impact of uncompensated care in communities with large numbers of uninsured affects
not simply the uninsured, but also the insured, as it can be a cause in the closure or reduction of services
for hospitals and clinics; and
WHEREAS, the right to healthcare is not only a moral issue, but an economic issue as well; and
WHEREAS, the United States loses an estimated $65 billion to $ 130 billion annually in lost workforce
participation due to the poor health and early deaths of uninsured adults; and

ciii

 WHEREAS, there is an ever widening disparity between the quality of healthcare in disadvantaged
communities compared to more prosperous communities, with the prosperous communities' healthcare
system afforded the latest technological and medical advances not available in poorer communities; and
WHEREAS, despite the common misconception, 80% of the uninsured are hard-working Americans,
who are employed, but are unable to obtain insurance through their employer or the employee share of the
premium is too expensive; and
WHEREAS, the uninsured are 3-4 times more likely than those with insurance to report problems getting
needed medical care and forgo or postpone care due to financial concerns; and
WHEREAS, upwards of 40% of the uninsured do not have a regular place to go for medical care and as a
result 20% seek their usual care at an emergency room; and
WHEREAS, as a result of healthcare access problems, it 1s estimated that 18,000 excess deaths of
uninsured people between ages 25-64 occur each year; and
WHEREAS, the consequences of not having a form of universal healthcare affects all of us, with
employers dropping health insurance from their benefits packages and those that continue to offer health
insurance, requiring employees pay a greater share; and
WHEREAS, even the insured find themselves a medical crisis away from facing medical bankruptcy or
at the least, serious financial hardship; and
WHEREAS, access to preventive health care, in fact, lowers healthcare costs by preventing more costly
and serious diseases from forn1ing or complications from existing conditions from materializing; and
WHEREAS, a healthier society and workforce is more productive and for a longer period of time than
the alternative; and
WHEREAS, the United States is the only industrialized nation that does not have some fonn of universal
healthcare, guaranteeing healthcare to all its citizens as a basic right.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners does
hereby urge the President of the United States, as well as Congress to make universal healthcare a priority
and to earnestly pursue the reforms and measures necessary to make it a reality, which is consistent with
the goals set forth in the government's "Healthy People 20 IO" initiative; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that access to healthcare should be considered a basic need, provided
to all Americans, and not a privilege based on a person's ability to pay; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a suitable copy of this Resolution be delivered to George W. Bush,
