GENERAL BACKGROUND

The Partnership for Transformation, JV has provided construction management services
under Contract No. 1022 since June 1, 2010. On March 16, 2010, the Board of Commissioners
approved up to two (2) one (1) year options in Resolution No. 2010-CHA-27. PFT is nearing the
end of Option Year No. 1. The Capital Construction Department requests that the
Commissioners approve the execution of Option Year No. 2.

The CHA continues to require construction and program management services in order to:

perform timely conversions of dwellings and non-dwellings to meet Federal and local
accessibility requirements;

0 successfully ?nish building upgrades to meet City of Chicago life safety and high-rise
regulations within the mandated deadlines;

0 complete all activities under the Capital Maintenance and Capital Improvement
Programs;
move forward with ongoing rehabilitation projects; and
effectively respond to any new activities that arise out of the Plan for Transformation 2.0.

PFT has become an integral part of the Capital Construction Department management team. It
has provided satisfactory service during its base year and Option Year No. l, and the
continuation of their construction management services is important to the timely achievement of
the original Plan for Transformation goals and the successful transition to any new goals
established under the Plan for Transformation 2.0. Over the years PFT has built up an intimate
knowledge of CHA housing stock, has created strong relationships with resident leaders, with
CHA staff in other departments, with personnel at City of Chicago Departments and with local
political leaders. It has developed a familiarity with the General Contractors and Prime Design
Consultants currently under contract with the CHA. PFT advises the CHA Executive Staff,
including the Chief Executive Of?cer, the Chief Operating Of?cer, the Executive Vice?
President of Development, and the Vice?President of the Capital Construction Department
regarding the progress of the Capital Improvement and Capital Maintenance Programs.

Based on the potential for varying project load over time, the original solicitation provided the
opportunity for staf?ng adjustments to best meet the needs of the program. Speci?c wording was
incorporated and highlighted in the body of the solicitation:

?Throughout the term of the contract, the CHA ?s construction needs for the projects set
forth above may change. Therefore, the CH4 shall review the CM ?s staffing levels on a semi-
annual basis, and reserves the right to adjust sta??ing levels accordingly. 

The initial emphasis on a limited number of large scale projects at the beginning of the Plan for
Transformation has dramatically shifted over the years to an ever larger number of smaller
projects under the Capital Maintenance Program as the CHA has returned to some developments
to make additional improvements when funding become available. In addition, the 
properties are required to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act and the
Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 The has also impacted
non-dwelling areas throughout the developments. The City of Chicago has enacted a Life
Safety and High-rise Ordinance that requires the CHA to make substantial upgrades to the life
safety systems within its own high rise buildings by 2015. CCD is determined to accomplish that
goal much earlier than 2015.

As part of the original solicitation for CM services, vendors were required to provide projected
staf?ng levels for both Option Years. For Option Year 2, the original solicitation referenced a
project load of fourteen (14) projects, to which the PFT responded that a staff level of 10.25 Full
Time Equivalent positions would be necessary, for $1,915,847. Since then the numbers
of projects have increased substantially to 61 projects. These projects will be smaller in size than
in the past, but experience has shown that small projects are every bit as labor intensive

.- d. ?-15 tun-v.2-

as large scale projects. And much of the current and future work is being performed in Scattered
Sites spread from one end of Chicago to the other. To prosecute this work pursuant to the
contract, CCD requested and agreed upon additional staf?ng with PFT, revising the original
10.25 to 18.25 Ma The additional 8 will increase the fee by $1,370,563
along with a modest increase of $34,367 in the reimbursable amount, for a new NTE of
$3,320,777. Although the original March 9 2010 board letter re?ected the proposed staf?ng
levels and contract amount of $1,915,847, the Board resolutions, amendments and contract allow
for the adjustment of additional sta?ing, CCD staff has reviewed the fee for the additional staff
and has determined that the proposed hourly rates are at or below the rates provided by the PFT

in the original fee proposal page for Option Year 2.

PR REMENT ORY

On November 23, 2009 the Chicago Housing Authority advertised Request for
Proposal No. 09-00403 (RFP) for Authority-Wide Construction Management Services. As the
result of that solicitation, the Board of Commissioners approved Resolution No. 2010-CHA-27
on March 16, 2010, authorizing the CHA to execute a contract with Partnership for
Transformation, JV Contract No. 1022 was executed with PFT on June 1, 2010 for a
one (1) year base period with two (2) one (1) year renewal options. The base one (1) year
contract for a not-to-exceed fee of $2,975,581.00 covered the period of June 1, 2010 through
May 31, 2011.

The Board of Commissioners passed Resolution 2011-CHA-62 on May 17, 2011, authorizing
Amendment No. to exercise Option Year No. 1, including modi?cations to the organizational
staf?ng, in the not-to-exceed amount of $2,774,338.00. The contract was extended from June 1,
2011 thru May 31, 2012. The current total contract value of Contract No. 1022 is not?to-exceed
$5,749,919.00.



Based on the foregoing, and the Partnership for Transformation?s expertise in the construction
industry, proven track record of completing projects in atimely manner, resource ?exibility, and
cost effectiveness, the Capital Construction Department recommends that the Board of
Commissioners authorize the Chief Executive Of?cer or his designee to approve Amendment
No. 02 to Contract No. 1022 with the Partnership for Transformation, IV in the not-to-exceed
amount of $3,320,777.00 for Option Year No. 2, including modi?cations to organizational
staf?ng and an increase in the not-to-exceed amount for reirnbursables of $34,367.00. The
contract will be extended for the period of June 1, 2012 through May 31, 2013. The new total
contract value of Contract No. 1022 is the not-to-exceed amount of $9,070,696.00.

This amendment is subject to the firm?s compliance with Section 3 resident
hiring, and bonding and insurance requirements.
