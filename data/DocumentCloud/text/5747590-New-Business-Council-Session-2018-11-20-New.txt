Re: Menorah Sculpture

Dear Ben:

At your request we have reviewed the attached drawing of the Menorah Sculpture and
observed the sculpture in the fabrication shep. The main vertical section of the sculpture is
an HSS 616:3!? tube column. This section sits into a 21? deep shoe with diagonal braces
on top of a 48? 148?: thick base plate which in turn sits on top of a 38 V: tall 8?-0?x 
0? tubular frame angled base. The tube frame base is composed of HSS 2x2x3/16 sections.
The vertical diagonal corner members are double [158 2x2 sections. The top of the base
has HSS 212x3/l6 horizontal members approximately 16? o.c with additional l?xl? tube
sections members perpendicular to the HSS 2x2 members. The base plate is mounted to the
base section with (6) 7/16 hardened steel bolts through the 1" tube members. The bottom
of the base has diagonal members each corner for the placement of ballast.

Per the drawing provided, the total weight of the Menorah Sculpture is approximately
MW. We have reviewed the overall stability of the sculpture for code required wind loads
including the approximate weight of the sculpture. We recommend 240# of ballast (cement
or sand bags) be placed each corner of the base to provide additional stability against
overturning. In our opinion, with the added ballast, the sculpture will be stable against

overturning.

Please feel free to call if you have any questions or need any additional information.

1 DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTWORK

Name: Prismatica

Type: Interactive light installation
Location: Outdoors Indoors
Description:

A modern ice palace. Prismatica turns heads with the countless colourful reflections made by its
giant prisms. Visitors can walk among them to see city life in every colour of the spectrum, and
turn the prisms to make the colours dance. After sunset, the enormous interactive kaleidoscope's
illusory effects reach a crescendo.

Prismatica is a participatory installation comprising 25 pivoting prisms more than two meters tall.
Each one is made of panels covered with a dichroic film that reflects the colours of the rainbow,
varying with the light source and viewing angle. Each prism is mounted on a base containing a
projector that gives the installation a new dimension after nightfall. The rotation of the prisms
triggers variable?intensity bell music.

HONORABLE PLANNING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT STANDING


RE: Request of the Downtown Development Authority in conjunction with Olympia
Development of Michigan to amend Article XVII, District Map No. 3 of Chapter 61 of
the 1984 Detroit City Code, Zoning and the provisions of the existing PD (Planning
Development) zoning district established by Ordinance 10-15 on land bounded by
Woodward Ave. on the east, the south side of Henry St. on the south, Clifford Ave. and
Cass Ave. on the west and Sproat St. on the North; and to rezone a portion of the
remaining B4 (General Commercial) zoned land along the east side of Cass Ave. between
Sproat St. and Henry St., and, as well as the to-be-vacated Henry Street right-of-way, to
PD. (REQUESTING 5th EXTENSION OF REVIEW PERIOD)

On Junc13, 2017 the Detroit City Council received and referred to the Planning and Economic
Development Standing Committee the report and recommendation of the City Planning
Commission (CPC) for the above captioned map amendment request for the Detroit Zoning
Ordinance.

The Zoning Ordinance speci?es in Sec. 61-3-17, ?Where a petition for a proposed Zoning
Ordinance text or map amendment is not voted upon by the City Council within one hundred
twenty (120) days of the time of receipt of the City Planning Commission?s report, it shall be
deemed to have been-denied, unless extended by the City Council.?

The original 120-day review period for this matter was to expire in October of 20 1 7. Subsequently,
however, three extensions have been authorized with the most recent, of 120 days, being granted
on July 31, 2018. On Wednesday, November 28, 2018 that extension will expire at day?s end.

CPC is pleased to report that a revised petition #1388 requesting the right?of-way adjustments on
and around the arena site has been submitted to the City Clerk by Giffels Webster on behalf the
Downtown Development Authority and Olympia Development of Michigan. This revised petition,
if acceptable to DPD and DWSD, should relieve blockage to completing the vacation of Henry
and the other streets thus allowing the necessary sequence of events to proceed in order to facilitate
the long-held PD rezoning and modi?cation. Consequently, the CPC requests another 120?day
extension of the review period to avoid having to re-start the ordinance revision process over again
at the Flaming Commission. A resolution to that effect is attached for Your consideration. The
requested extension, if granted, will expire by the close of the day Wednesday, March 28, 2019.

HONORABLE CITY COUNCIL

RE: Request of Intersection Consulting Group on behalf of 262 Mack, Mack Investments 1,
LLC to review site plans and elevations for a Planned Development (PD) zoning
classi?cation within Article XVII, District Map No. 4, of the 1984 Detroit City Code,
Chapter 61, Zoning, to erect two residential carriage-home apartment units above an
existing garage at property commonly referred to as 262 Mack Avenue.
(RECOMMEND APPROVAL)

NATURE OF REQUEST

In 2016 Your Honorable Body voted to approve the request of Intersection Consulting Group on
behalf of Mack Investments 1, LLC. The original request was for site plan review (SPR) for site
plans and elevations for a proposed development on land that is currently zoned PD and is
located within the Brush Park Historic District. The subject site is located on the south side of
Mack Avenue between Brush St. and John R. The original plan called for the construction of a
nine (9) unit multi-family dwelling with a single-story garage to support the new units. The
revised proposed multi-family dwelling is planned to be three (3) stories in height. The ?oor plan
proposes three (3) units to be approximately 1,058 square feet in area each and the remaining (6)
six units are to be 1,279 sq. ft. each. (see attached original plans).

PROPOSAL

Since the original proposal was approved by City Council via resolution in March of 2017, the
petitioner has since come back with a supplementary request. The proposal that is before you for
consideration at this time include the addition of two (2) carriage-home style apartments to be
erected above an existing garage. According to discussions with the petitioner and review of past
Buildings Safety Engineering and Environmental Department records, the existing garage began
construction somewhere around the period of the 2007-2009 housing crash which, was the result
of the housing bubble that affected many developers in Detroit. Seemingly, due to the economic
conditions of that period, the original developer never completed the full plans for the garage.
Since then the property has been transferred to 262 Mack, Mack InveStments I, LLC. The current
developer would like to complete the construction of the structure by adding these units to what
was previously approved.

The revised proposal calls for two new units, each 822 sq. ft. I area, to go above the two (2) car
garage. The two units would be inclusive of a bedroom with closet space, bathroom, living room,
kitchen, nook, and laundry room. The plans also call for balconies on the northern (front)

Newman 315 (gm

elevation, totaling four (4) in all; one (1) accessible from the bedroom and one (1) from the
living room spaces.

ANALYSIS

Zoning and Development Plan Provisions

The 3rd Modi?ed Brush Park Development Plan provides the underlying zoning for the PD
district. The Plan designates the subject land for institutional and commercial uses. Table B-2 of
the development plan lists multi-family dwellings as a permitted secondary use on the subject
property making it consistent with current provisions.

Parking

According to 61-14-24 of the Zoning Ordinance, parking requirements for a multiple-family
dwelling are 1.25 spaces per dwelling unit and 0.75 per dwelling unit if located within 0.25 miles
of a bus rapid transit, street car/trolley or light rail line. This development would qualify for the
reduction in parking requirements because of its proximity to the coming rail line located on
Woodward.

As the apartment unit count raises by the additional two (2) carriage home units that are being
proposed, it brings the total number of units on the site (inclusive of the original nine (9)
approved units) to a total of 11 units. According to the current zoning provisions, the totality of
the development including the previously approved nine (9) units, requires a total of 8.25 parking
spaces. The parking plan provides the appropriate amount of spaces required.

Design
The design of the development must be in accordance with the PD district design criteria listed in
Section 61?1 1-15 of the Zoning Ordinance.

When criterion speaks to the compatibility of the development with existing development, it
can be said that this project is in alignment with the trend of Brush Park to be inclusive of
carriage homes. Another development known as Brush Park Village North, which came before
this Honorable Body for approval in 2017 also proposed and was approved for carriage homes.

As development has picked up in the City, developers have continuously inquired about the
possibility of new construction carriage homes, as many that exist today are the remnant of
historic neighborhoods and were in most cases, likely grandfathered in, post zoning regulations
or are subject of variance or special approval. Carriage-homes are being revisited by the City as a
typology merits being allowed on a broader basis. Carriage homes allow for developments to be
more ?nancially feasible for developers as well as tenants. They usually help to create
opportunities for lower income individuals to participate in more af?uent areas while also
increasing the density of a neighborhood, also increasing vibrancy and diversity.

Criterion points to parking and loading, questioning whether it is adequate for what is being
proposed. In this case, the parking will be accessed from the rear of the building as vehicles are
planned to use the public alley to reach the garage parking for the units. This off-street parking
and loading is appropriate and typical for a Brush Park development.

In response to criterion which addresses accessibility, the Commission points to the fact that
the development will incorporate a semi-circular driveway creating a more convenient
ingress/egress for residents of the building. Using the alley access is typical for the land uses

located on the in Brush Park. The City?s Fire Marshall conducted an initial review of the
con?guration of the plans and was satis?ed.

Master Plan Consistency

The Planning and Development Department originally submitted a determination letter
con?rming the compatibility of the proposal with the City?s Master Plan of Policies. CPC has
received no negative comments by PDD to differ from the original Master Plan determination.

COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT
The developer is in consultation with the Brush Park CDC in regards to a revised letter of

support for the project. CPC has been waiting for this last

RECOMMENDATION
At its regular meeting of February 1St 2018, the City Planning Commission voted to approve this

proposal with the following conditions:

1. That the developer work with the immediately adjacent community to minimize disruption to
the neighborhood during construction and address impacts that may arise; and

2. That ?nal site plans, elevations, lighting, landscape and signage plans be submitted by the
developer to the staff of the City Planning Commission for review and approval prior to
submitting applications for applicable permits.

1) Concern expressed about the development of the RFP for the sale of the park land; why
the community was not engaged in the design of the RFP

2) Concern expressed by the community as to why the skate park that was currently
operating on the site was not incorporated into the RFP

3) Concern expressed by the community about the decommissioning of the Wigle
Recreation Center and Playfield; why the community was not involved in the decision to

Tuesday. June 6 201 7: NA 0 Selection

The second meeting of the CBO process was held at Jumbo's, 3736 3rd Avenue, Detroit, MI,
48201. The purpose of this meeting was to have the Impact Area Residents select their
nominees to serve on the Neighborhood Advisory Council. An agenda, project summary, and
copy of the Community Benefits Ordinance was prepared and distributed to NAC members, the
public, and the respective offices of City Council members. Officially, thirty-three people signed
the sign?in-sheets.

Election of NAC Members

Two sign in sheets were provided. These were to indicate who was a resident of the Impact
Area and who was not a resident of the impact area.

0 Table 1: Sign?in for Impact Area Resident (those that live within the Impact Area)
0 Table 2: Sign-in for Residents that live outside the Impact Area (those that do not
live within the Impact Area)

Karen Gage, PDD, provided an overview of the Midtown West Project and a handout. She also
provided a review of Community Benefits Ordinance (CBC) and Neighborhood Advisory Council
(NAC) Frequently Asked Questions Hand Out.

Those who were impact area residents indicated if they wished to be considered a NAC
Candidate. Those names were scribed onto a large poster. The candidates that wished to be
considered provided a two minute presentation as to why they wanted to serve on the NAC.
Each candidate was required to provide proof of residence in the impact area.

Each Impact Area Resident was then able to place a dot next to the name ofthe candidate they
wished to nominate to serve on the NAC. Votes were then tallied and the top two candidates
were be selected to serve on the NAC.

Candidate names are as follows:

Cindy Darrah Jenny Lee Randy Lewarchik
Derrick Dykas Jesalyn Blount Samuel Merritt
Francine Dorn Lee Payne

 

 

Votes were tallied from the residents living in the defined impact area. Derrick Dykas and Jenny Lee were
elected to serve on the council. The remaining nominees were considered for appointment by Council and the
Planning Development Department.

 

 

Tues-dam July 11 201 7 at 6am located at 3535 Cass A we. Detroit. MI 43201

The third meeting of the CBO process was held at the Cass Corridor Neighborhood Development
Corporation offices, 3535 Cass Avenue, Detroit MI 48201 on July 11th at 6pm. In advance ofthis
meeting, the NAC emailed a list of questions regarding the development.

The purpose of this meeting was: 1) An introduction to, and seating of the full 2) To review
the questions raised by NAC members and the general public and the response to those
questions from PDD and the developer (3) For the PDD to explain that the project was on hold.
An agenda and a handout of the questions and answers was prepared and distributed to NAC
members, the public, and the respective offices of City Council members. Officially, six people
signed the sign?in-sheet; however the attendance was greater.

1) Karen Gage opened the meeting to announce the order of presentation, and acknowledge the
representative City Council members.

2) PDD presented the newly seated NAC and information packet including the agenda, a
PowerPoint print out, and a hand out of questions and answers.4

Since there was an issue securing an adjacent piece of property required for the site plan to be developed
as proposed, the NAC process was put on hold while the City of Detroit, the developer, and the adjacent
land owner continued talks as to how the piece of land needed for the original design intent ofthe
development site could be secured by the City or the developer.

Questions Raised by the Community Present

The NAC emailed a list of questions to PDD that they would like to have answered in advance of
the community forum. Here is the list of questions and the response to those questions that
were provided in advance of the meeting.

0 We would like to review the developer '5 response to Section 3 in the RFP, Program
Requirements and Guiding Principles, specifically for public open space, high
quality site design, street grid and walkable streets, reinforcing the public realm,
sustainable and equitable developments, and parking.

The design for Midtown West was formulated around the notion of reopening 4th
Street, from Selden to MLK, as requested by the RFP. We expanded the idea of
reopening 4th Street with the proposed reopening of Tuscola and Brainard Streets.
The reintroduction of the city grid is a critical component to enhancing the quality
of walkability in the area. The park design is almost central to the development,
located at the intersection of 4th and Tuscola. Parking, which is a considerable
component of the development, is largely hidden from view from the city street
grid.

From a sustainability perspective, PDH will design the various buildings within the
development to incorporate many of the principles established by Enterprise Green
Community design Guidelines 


 

 

4 See APPENDIX 07 for PowerPoint.

PDH and its design team also focused on creating a variety of residential product
types,including for sale and rental, affordable and market rate, as well as small scale
neighborhood focused retail along Selden and 4th Streets.

. Can you provide a map of all the city owned properties within the impact area?
Yes, it has been provided.
0 How long is the tax abatement period for the development?

Outside of the NEZ certificate, it is unclear if the developer will seek additional
abatements at this time. An NEZ certificate is typically in place for 12 years. Any
additional abatement requests will be submitted via City Council along with the
NEZ application.

If the development team seeks additional abatements, a formal request to City
Council would be prepared by the development team and HRD. As part of this
process, the Legislative Policy Division would work with other City
agencies to conduct a feasibility analysis of the request. LPD compiles a report
that reviews the private investment of the developer and the public tax abatement
request. The report will cover the potential gains or losses the to the City's
budget, resulting from an approval of the request. This analysis is done to
determine the appropriate length of time of the abatement period. A City Council
subcommittee will hold a public hearing where this information is presented,
before City Council as a whole votes on the issue.

- Can we see the proforma for the development? Specifically, we're interested in
how muchpublic funding vs. private funding the project has, what their revenue
projections are over the next 10 years, and how they anticipate rental rates
changing over that period (both for the market rate and affordable units).

Unfortunately, we are not able to share the developer?s proforma in its entirety at
this time; however, we have provided some information that may help answer the
questions posed:

How much public funding:

Given part of the City's RFP requirements included the construction of
public roadways and a public park, the developer's response included an
initial assumption of a $3 million dollar CDBG ask for public improvements
to the site. They proposed that this money would go directly to the
construction of these public amenities. This CDBG request is the only
proposed public subsidy outlined in the developer's response. The City of
Detroit has not yet received a formal application for this request. It is
assumed that an amount of money, yet to be determined, will be provided
by the City for roads (including sidewalks, lighting, street trees, etc.) and for
the park. The City of Detroit and the developer will continue to work
through the details of these improvements (including cost 8t funding).

How much private funding:

17

The developer has proposed investing $74 Million.

Rent Projections:

The developer included market rate rent assumptions that range from
$2.30 PSF in phase I (2020) of the development to $3.00 PSF in phase II
(2022) of the development. The developer assumed a $375 PSF for?sale
price in phase I (2020) and $400 PSF for?sale price in phase II (2022).

income Restricted Housing:

Area Median Income for Detroit is defined by the average incomes across
Wayne County, Macomb County, and Oakland County. The US Housing and
Urban Development Department determines that a unit is affordable when 30%
or less of an individual's household?s income is spent on rent.

The US Housing and Urban Development Department reevaluates AMI on an
annual basis and updates affordable rents annually, as well. There is no cap or floor
on how much affordable rents can change each year. Affordable rent changes are
based on a change in AMI. Please see the charts below for more specific
information on Wayne County AMI income limits and rent.

. Can you send the site plan for street spacing, unit layout, building design, etc?

Attached are the layouts and views submitted in the RFP response. In addition,
information is posted on under the link ?Midtown West
Documents"

0 Are there any parking lots planned? What is the overall parking plan for the area?

Yes, see attached document. There are on?site parking spaces provided (meaning
parking provided for residents other than street parking). The parking lots are
screened from view, therefore the parking lots are difficult to see in the renderings and
site plan. At a minimum, the development project will provide 1 parking space per unit.
The site plan shows 350 onsite parking spaces and 335 total units.

In addition, the development will provide space for shared car service (ie zip car)
and will provide ample and secure bicycle storage space within each structure.

- Will the affordable units be integrated throughout, or clustered together?

The developer has proposed a mixed-income development where affordable units are
mixed throughout the site.

. Will the affordable units be affordable indefinitely, or for a specified time period?

The duration of affordability is closely tied to the funding structure of the units. For
example, when the City of Detroit invests CDBG or HOME funds into the construction
of affordable units of housing, that affordability is maintained for 30 years. As stated
in a response to a question above, tax abatements affordability requirements vary.
Units typically remain affordable for 12 years. LIHTC had additional affordability
regulation tied to it that can exceed 15 years.

- Will TuscoIa Park be split by a road? The plan currently shows the park being split by a road.

modification of the site design.

today Community Impacts

The purpose of this meeting was to have the developer present the development project to the NAC,

A summary ofthe items are as follows:

I Replace the seven acres of public recreation land that would be sold to private developers
with an equal amount of new public green space in the impact area; would like more than a
one acre park, perhaps a series of pocket parks.

I Engage area residents in the design of these green spaces, not just the one acre park. A
place for kids to play

I Ensure the one-acre park is designed to be integrated with the neighborhood, developed as
a community park, that is safely accessible, is contiguous, and is available to all ages and
abilities.

I Affordability of the rental units should be set at lower rates to be in line with the income of
Detroit residents, rather than the AMI that is an average of the tri?county incomes.

I Offer a diversity of unit sizes to attract seniors to families. Accommodate all age types,
family sizes, and abilities.

I Hire local and WMBE

I Support digital inclusion in the neighborhood through the donation of broadband to the

Tuesday. Janua? 16?. 2018 at Sam at 

The fifth meeting of the CBO process was held at CCN DC, 3535 Cass Ave., Detroit, MI 48201 at
6pm. The purpose of this meeting was to present the developers initial response to the list of
community impacts that were presented by the NAC.

The City of Detroit provided a response to the two questions raised directly to the City. The
development team then presented their responses to the NAC requests.

There was a long discussion relative to the loss of park land within neighborhood. Here is a
summary of the main concerns the community asked the City representatives:

0 NAC presented that the community is going to lose park space and would like to see the
7-acres of parkland replaced by the City in the impact area.

0 Other parkland has been sold in the area for development, in addition to this large park.

0 GSD acknowledged a park deficit in the area and explained they are working on a
planning framework to identify land and other improvements to park space in the area;
however it is unlikely that 7?acres of land will be replaced in the impact area.

Other questions raised by the NAC to the City relative to parks and open space

- Will the City commit to replacing parkland in Midtown?

0 What is the process and timeline to determine where parkland will be replaced and will
City-owned land be held for recreation or park purpose - since much of it has been sold
for development or is currently being advertised for development?

- Residents would be interested in seeing a series of pocket parks within the community
for play lots.

- What is timeline for selecting the area that will be replacing the 7?acres of park
land used by this development - in the impact area

- Will the developer pay for any improvements to replace the park land in the Impact
Area?

. The new park that will be created out of this development must include a playscape
area and a place for kids of all ages to play: playground equipment, basketball court, etc.

0 Can the network of parks in the community replace what is being lost by this
development

The developer handed out a document that outlined the response to a number of issues
presented by the NAC and Council at the last meeting. The development team provided their
initial response to the list of impacts?, as follows:

0 Will the developer provide few affordable units at a deeper subsidy that is more in line
with Detroit resident incomes?

 

5 See Appendix 09 for NAC List of Community Impacts 12/12/17 with Developer Response in Red

23

0 Will the developer provide a couple of options and financial models or options on what
the subsidy level will be, and how many units the developer can provide at that level if
subsidy?

NAC suggested the developer meet with the Ford Foundation about affordable housing
and that the developer work with to market the affordable units in the
neighborhood. NAC also asked to see marketing plan for the affordable units.

- NAC asked to see the developer's NET profits from the development and that the
developer commit 5% of the NET profits to fund for affordability of housing units or
retail units.

1. Green space.
a. Increase the size of the proposed common greenspace by at least 1 acre;

- Developer Response: The RFP required the developer to provide a park of at
least 1 acre. And the developer is currently proposing a park of 1 acre. There
is also green space within the development parcels that are not part of the 1
acre park area.

b. Make it continuous, rather than divided by a street;

Developer Response: The developer?s current design is for a park of 1
continuous acre.

Ensure that it is visible and easily accessible to non?residents;

- Developer Response: The Park is located along 4th Street between Tuscola and
Brainard, making it easily accessible to both residents and non?residents.

0! Ensure that it is wheelchair accessible, includes a playscape, picnic tables, and
other amenities to be determined through a community engagement
process.

- Developer Response: The park will be designed in conjunction with the City of
Detroit. The park will meet all ADA requirements for accessibility.

2 Affordability.

a. Use average household income for Detroit to determine affordability, not
Wayne County ($401/mo. single person; $453/mo. 2 ppl; $551/mo 3
4 pp1)7
- Developer Response: The developer?s response to the RFP utilized Wayne

County AMI as the measure of affordability. Financial constraints on the
development project do not allow us to market the affordable units using the
City of Detroit AMI as the measure of affordability.

estate values on commercial and residential renters in the neighborhood,
especially minority?owned businesses and low?income residents. 8

Monday. Agni! 09, 2013 at 6:00 PM at 69m at CONDO
At this meeting between the NAC and the development team, the Agenda is as follows:

- Update from the Recreation Department on Community Engagement and
Park Planning

- Review of the Developers Response to Community Impacts

Parks

Brad Dick and Meagan Elliot of the General Services Department and the Recreation
Department were present to respond to NAC concerns specifically to parks:

The City?led public engagement process for a renovated Wigle Park, to
address the NAC raised concern that the developer would design the public
park, without community input.

- The addition of new park space in Midtown to address the NAC raised
concern loss of park space in the community by this development (and the
loss of park space to other recent development projects in the neighborhood)

Brad Dick reported that the City will lead a public engagement process with
stakeholders to determine the use and improvements to be made to the 1?acre Wigle
Park. This one-acre park will be community designed with GSD. The park will be owned
and maintained by the City. This public process will include three community meetings.
These engagement meetings will begin within 90 days of the closing of the land sale.

Brad Dick also reported that the City has identified one and a half acres of additional
park land that is in a 12 minute walk of the Wigle site. This land will be acquired by the
Recreation Department and put into service within 12 months of the land sale closing.
The public engagement process on what the design of these parks will include will take
place at the same time the engagement process for Wigle takes place.

An agenda and the copy of the handout provided by the General Service Department
(GSD) has been included in Appendix 11.

Community Benefits Summary

The remainder of this meeting was dedicated to reviewing the Wigle Community

discussion on these topics.

The Community Benefits Summary reviewed at this meeting can be found in Appendix
12.

At this meeting the NAC expressed support for the package as a whole, with
modifications. There were two items that were not fully addressed. Specific areas of
concern:
- What are the affordability breakdowns and can the developer offer more units
at a deeper affordability option?
- Will accept $50,000 from the development team for community
space? The request was for $200,000 to replace community space in the
neighborhood.

In addition, Councilmember Castaneda Lopez asked if the developer would be providing
union labor to run the facility. Or at minimum, a commitment to using Detroit based,
locally owned/minority company for the janitorial, maintenance, landscaping and
security contracts.

It was decided that any outstanding issues would be addressed via email
communication. Attached is Appendix 13 that summarizes the email exchange between
the City, Developer, and NAC to resolve the final options.

Benefits Summary report prepared by Karen Gage, Planning and Development Department. At this
meeting, all items of the Community Benefits Summary Report were agreed to by the NAC, with

counts on both remaining issues: a contribution from the developer to the Cass Corridor Neighborhood
Development Corporation to mitigate the loss of the recreational space at Wigle Playfield and
the preferred affordability structure for the final project.

units at 80% at Wayne County AMI, 5% affordable units at 60% Wayne County AMI, and
2.5% affordable at 40% AMI. On June 1, 2018, Jenny Lee of the Wigle NAC relayed the
vote count on the affordability option with 3 votes for option 1, 4 votes for option 3, and
2 non?responses.

It should be noted that although the group did select this option, the group did want to

the offer of $50,000 to the CCN DC into the Wigle CBA, with 4 votes for "yes,? one

The City of Detroit welcomes the Midtown West Development headed by PDH Development Group, a partnership

between Detroit?based developer Roderick Hardamon and New York-based developer Mario Procida. PDH
Development Group is purchasing the former 7 acre Wigle Recreation site from the City of Detroit to develop a
mixed-use, mixed-income project over $75 million that will bring approximately 335 new residential units (20% of
rental units will be affordable), over 8,000 square feet of retail space, and a new one-acre of public park to the
vacant site of the former Wigle Recreation Center, helping meet the ever-increasing demand for housing in the
City of Detroit.

The Impact Area, determined by the Planning Development Department, is defined by Forest Avenue on the
North, Cass Avenue on the East, Peterboro Street on the South, and the John Lodge Freeway on the West. (See

Recommendations from the Neighborhood Advisory Council for the
Proposed Midtown West Development

Recommendations for the Citv of Detroit Planning and Development
Department:

1. Replace the seven acres of public recreation land that would be sold to private
developers with an equal amount of new public green space in the impact area;
engage area residents in the design of these green spaces.

A response to this request should be issued by the City.

2. Add stop signs street lights on Third to increase accessibility to the park
inside the development.

- A response to this request should be issued by the City. The developer
will work with the City?s traffic and engineering department to determine
locations for traf?c control devices within the development site.

Recommendations for the developers:

1. Green space.
3 Increase the size of the proposed common greenspace by at least 1 acre;
- The RFP required the developer to provide a park ofat least 1 acre. And

the developer is currently proposing a park of 1 acre. There is also
green space within the development parcels that are not part ofthe 1

acre park area.
Make it continuous, rather than divided by a street;
- The developers current design is for a park of 1 continuous acre.
c. ensure that it is visible and easily accessible to non?residents;
- The Park is located along Street between Tuscola and Brainard.
Making it easily accesable to both residents and non-residents
ensure that it is wheelchair accessible, includes a playscape, picnic
tables, and other amenities to be determined through a community
engagement process.

- The park will be designed in conjunction with the City of Detroit. The
park will meet all ADA requirements for accessibility. The park will be
designed for the quiet enjoyment ofthe neighborhood.

2. Affordability.
8 Use average household income for Detroit to determine affordability, not

Wayne County ($401/mo. single person; $453/mo. 2 ppl; $551/m0 3

 4 ppl)1

- The developer?s response to the RFP utilized Wayne County AMI as
the measure of affordability. Financial constraints on the deveIOpment
project do not allow us to market the affordable units using to City of
Detroit AMI as the measure ofaffordability.

3. Community impact fund.

a. Commit 5% of each unit sold and 5% of pro?ts from rental properties over
the next 10 years to a fund that will mitigate the negative effects of rising
real estate values on commercial and residential renters in the
neighborhood, especially minority-owned businesses and low-income
residents.2

- The developer has committed to providing 20% ofthe rental units as
affordable housing. Any additional financial burden on the
development will adversely impact the feasibility ofthe development.

4. Inclusive, accessible design.

a. Design the site to be open and integrated with the surrounding neighborhood;

- The developer is committed to high quality design. Neighborhood
context is important in design. The developer has assembled a team of
renowned design professionals who produce the highest caliber of
work. The developer has spent considerable time working on the site
plan and ensuring the reintegration ofthe road network will work well
within the neighborhood and will produce a highly livable
neighborhood experience.

b. invest in maintenance and landscaping of the pedestrian bridges over the
Lodge;

- The bridges over the Lodge are currently owned by MDOT. The
developer is unwilling to provide any capital to finance work done on
MDOT controlled property.
0. offer diverse unit types that can accommodate senior citizens, families

with children, and people with disabilities.
- The developer will comply with all accessibility requirements set
forward in ADA guidelines. The developer will have a unit mix of
Studioapartments in addition to townhomes.
The units (other than townhomes) will be proportionately distributed
amongst the affordable and market rate units. The affordable units
will be evenly mixed throughout the buildings.

5. Historic and cultural preservation.
a. Commission Detroit artists to produce murals or other art depicting the
history and cultural legacy of the Cass Corridor that is publicly visible in

and around the development.

- In appropriate locations the developer is willing to meet with and

 

1 Chicago Federal Reserve Bank. "Essays on Issues." 2017 Number 376. Page 4
2 Midtown Inc. has expressed willingness to administer such a fund

possibly to work with local artists the NAC recommends. However,
in order to maintain designs envisioned by the development?s
architects the developer cannot commit to murals on the exteriors of
the buildings.
6. Retail selection.
a. Conduct a survey of residents to assess current gaps in local retail options;

- The developer is willing to survey local residents for what retail
would fit well in the Midtown West development

b. Analyze area income data to determine appropriate price points for
selected businesses;

- The developer will rely upon the retail tenants to set their price
points.

0. use an ethical business matrix when selecting retail tenants that
considers factors. Such as quality of product, affordability, treatment
of workers, environmental sustainability.

- The developer will consider what the neighborhood needs and
attempt to lease the retail space to a tenant who is set up to be
successful over the long term providing valuable services to
not only the residents ofMidtown West but the broader
community as well.

Digital inclusion.
a. Dedicate at least one business class Internet connection to be shared with

the Cass Co Neighborhood Wireless Network3

- The developer cannot commit to providing a wireless network

connection at this time.
8 Labor and hiring.

a. Prioritize local hiring and commit to using responsible contractors who
respect collective bargaining rights for janitorial, maintenance, landscaping,
and security contracts;

- The developer commits to hiring 30% local contractors during the
construction ofthe development. At this time the developer is
unable to commit to hiring union labor forjanitorial, maintenance,
landscaping, and security contracts.

b. prioritize Detroit-based and minority?owned contractors.

- The developer commits to hiring a minimum of30% local and will
prioritize MWBE contractors during the construction ofthe

development.
9. Environmental health.
a. Create as much permeable surface as possible;

The developer will study sustainable methods for the development
such as storm water retention. The streets and the park will be
designed to city of Detroit standards.

b. use energy ef?cient appliances and renewable energy sources where possible;
