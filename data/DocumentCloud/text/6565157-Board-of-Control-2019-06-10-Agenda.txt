Explanation for Additional Funds
New items:
Ref 141 - Surface Weather System (SWS) - $171,537.87
The Surface Weather System was work directed by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) not included
in the original contract. The following is a detailed explanation of why the work was added:
There was an existing piece of equipment (F-420 weather equipment) that was supposed to be relocated
in Phase 1 because it was located within the Runway Object Free Area. During Phase 1, the FAA informed
the County that they would be funding a new Automated Weather Observation System (AWOS) system.
Since an AWOS offers far more weather capabilities then the F-420, instead of relocating the F-420, that
antenna was going to be demolished. After Phase 3 and 4 were bid, but before construction began, the
FAA Air Traffic organization came back and informed the Airports District Office and the County that they
required dual redundancy, so they needed the AWOS and the F-420 (although no one from AT could
supply the criteria or guidance that required this). So, the plan was back on to relocate the F-420. Then
the FAA said they were going to use this as an opportunity to install an SWS antenna. So, the contractor
moved the power and control and prepared the site at the location of the new F-420 and the FAA installed
the SWS instead.
Ref No. 145 - Project Acceleration - $203,567.37
A delay in receiving the approved modified Army Corps Permit caused a time extension to the project. To
avoid the possibility of the Airport being out of service for the winter, the work was accelerated to meet
a deadline for the FAA flight check. If the deadline would have been missed, it could not have been
rescheduled for months, hence making the airport unusable.
Ref No. 146 - Delay Costs - $223,647.37
These were costs allowed per the specifications for the delay to the project caused by the delay in
obtaining the approved Army Corps Permit.
The other new items, along with the increases/decreases, were needed to complete the project as
intended.
