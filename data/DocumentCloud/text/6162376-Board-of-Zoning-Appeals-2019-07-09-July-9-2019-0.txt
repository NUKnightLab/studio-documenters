IX.

Metro Signs requests permission to erect an internally illuminated
Sign (Grandma Bob’s Pizza) BY seeking waivers from developmental
standards, use regulations and dimensional variances. The
projecting sign is 13 square feet and internally illuminated. The signs
are considered flashing signs and not permissible within this
Traditional Main Street Overlay District in a B4-H Zone (General
Business District-Historic). This case is appealed because electronic
message boards are not allowed to cover more than 25% of the sign
face area and are considered flashing signs. In the Traditional Main
Street Overlay area, animated signs with flashing or moving lights are
prohibited. However, the Board of Zoning Appeals may modify this
developmental standard specified in this article (Article XIV of this
Chapter; Traditional Main Street Overlay Area) and after a public
hearing, a variance may be granted by the Board based on the
approval criteria of Section 61-4-81 of this Code in this instance;
Illumination of signage shall be provided by external lighting. Internal
illumination of signs is prohibited. (Sections 61-6-10 Electronic
Message Boards, 61-6-7 Business Sign, 61-14-300(13) Illumination of
Signs in TMSO area, 61-6-14 Identification Sign, 61-4-92(2) Other
Variances, Variance of Development Standard and 61-4-81 Approval
