a) Recommending to amend Board Approval No. BC2019-139, dated 2/19/2019, which authorized an
alternative procurement process, which will result in an award recommendation to an electronic
discovery vendor and related legal services in the amount not-to-exceed $140,000.00 $54,000.00 for
temporary attorney services for the period 2/25/2019 – 2/24/2020, by changing the procurement process

2/25/2019 – 2/24/2020.
Funding Source: General Fund
Jonathan McGory and Nora Hurley, Department of Law, presented. Trevor McAleer asked how many
responses to the issuance of bids were received and what was the range of the bid amounts; asked what
the response from the Department of Information Technology was on how the search will progress since
the search terms, as they relate to the subpoena request, have been provided by the Attorney General
and do they believe this will produce a quicker result; asked how many e-mails are estimated for review
with the new search terms given and expressed that he is not comfortable moving forward with this
contract today as the volume of documents is still unknown, even though we have been provided the
search terms; Mr. McAleer further expressed the need to be completely transparent in this process so
that these types of requests appear on the printed agenda and that his preference would be to know the
number of records affected in the evaluation process to determine if any could be done in-house or if
outside services will be required due to volume; recommended that the item be held for one week to get
a better idea of how many e-mails will be reviewed; and asked what impact a one-week delay would have.
Dale Miller asked why the amount of $140,000.00 is being requested since the low bid came in at
$54,000.00; asked if the vendor will work on subpoena-related matters only or will they also address
related public records requests; and asked if the deadline to comply with subpoena is still March 1.
Nan Baker concurred with Mr. McAleer’s recommendation to hold the item for one week and said that
the Department of Law can return to the Board for additional funding, if costs exceed $54,000.00.
Trevor McAleer asked for clarification on whether the County has already addressed parts of the subpoena
and that this will only red-flag attorney-client privileged or Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA)
communications that exist in the documents to be reviewed.
Michael Dever asked if a delay of one week will cause problems for the Law Department.
Nan Baker commented that the new deadline is 18 days after the original deadline date, which should
relieve some of the time pressure to complete reviews.

 Dale Miller asked if the volume of the County Executive’s e-mails from 2016 to present is a substantial
number of records.
Mr. McAleer asked if employees whose e-mails are being turned over will still have access to those emails upon request, if needed.
Maggie Keenan clarified Mr. McAleer’s question and asked if employees will see e-mails before they are
turned over and asked if the Law Department is comfortable waiting one week for approval; stated that
a significant amount of Armond Budish’s e-mails that are turned over will contain attorney-client
privileged information that will need review and expressed her concern about delaying the approval;
recommended the contract be approved with a not-to-exceed amount of $54,000.00, as the Board
regularly approves contracts in not-to-exceed amounts; recommended that the Law Department report
back regularly with updates and stated the that March 18 deadline is only a few weeks away. Ms. Keenan
also stated that she does not recommend waiting and stressed the need to meet deadlines and also to
continue to respond to public records requests in a reasonable timeframe.
Mr. McAleer restated that it is important to wait to see what the volume of e-mails for review will be prior
to proceeding with contract approval and that the amount approved should be actual amount rather than
a not-to-exceed amount.
Maggie Keenan motioned to amend the agenda to consider the item; Michael Dever seconded; The
motion to amend the agenda was approved by majority vote with Trevor McAleer casting a dissenting
vote.
Dale Miller asked for clarification if the item being considered is not-to-exceed $54,000.00. Maggie
Keenan motioned to amend the agenda to change the not-to-exceed amount from $140,000.00 to
$54,000.00; Michael Dever seconded.
Maggie Keenan motioned to approve the item; Michael Dever seconded; Item BC2019-154 was approved
by majority vote, as amended, with Nan Baker and Trevor McAleer casting dissenting votes.
