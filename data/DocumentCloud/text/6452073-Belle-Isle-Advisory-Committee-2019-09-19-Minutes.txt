 General Updates
Ron Olson, Chief, DNR, Parks and Recreation
Provided an update regarding the state FY2020 budget process and that there was the potential

the budget would be resolved.

PUBLIC COMMENTS (3 minutes each)
Michael Betzold

Last August, after a perfunctory review period of a few weeks, the DNR
approved a new contract for the Grand Prix. No one on this committee
raised any objection. The outcome was never in doubt. Month after
month, for years, we have come to these meetings and pointed out how
this extremely intrusive corporate auto race is completely incompatible
with this very precious public park and how year-round access to this
island is vital to the health and welfare of Detroiters. Since you are
supposed to be stewards of Belle Isle, it shouldn’t even be necessary to
keep telling you these things. But all we get are occasional patronizing
reassurances that you are listening to us. Obviously, you’re not. Or you
have a wildly different view of what stewardship is-because the Grand
Prix defies the core missions of the DNR, the Belle Isle Conservancy and
even this committee. The contract the DNR rubber stamped 13 months
ago was for three years and has a clause that reads: “The initial term of
this agreement may be extended for an additional two-year term upon
written notice by Permittee and written approval by Permitter.” Three
people at this table have the power to unilaterally pull the plug on this
event: Ron Olson, Michele Hodges, Bud Denker. I’m not holding my
breath on them. But if some other member went on record now, opposing
any further extension of the race after 2021, it would have a huge impact.
It would show someone here actually has been not just listening to the
public but paying attention. The DNR’s own surveys show park users
overwhelmingly oppose the race. Such a declaration would take some
guts and independence. But you’d have plenty of good company. Other
civic and community leaders are not afraid to defy Roger Penske. You
would join the citizens of this community who care deeply about their
public space, their environment, their family reunions, their weddings, this
place where they can run, walk, bike, or just sit by the water. We would
welcome you on the right side of this issue. We aren’t going to stop
talking and protesting until the Grand Prix takes all its supposed benefits
somewhere else, somewhere more appropriate than here.
