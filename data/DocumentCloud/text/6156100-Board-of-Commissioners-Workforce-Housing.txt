PROPOSED RESOLUTION
CALLING FOR A HEARING TO DISCUSS THE FINDINGS OF THE ALTERNATIVE SCHOOLS
NETWORK AND UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS’ REPORT ON YOUTH JOBLESSNESS
WHEREAS, a new report, Lost: The Crisis Of Jobless and Out Of School Teens and Young Adults In Chicago,
Los Angeles, New York Illinois and the U.S., was commissioned by the Alternative Schools Network and developed
by the University of Illinois Chicago’s Great Cities Institute; and,
WHEREAS, despite a growing national economic recovery, youth employment (16-24) is still at 27%
nationwide; and,
WHEREAS, Chicago leads the national average in out of work, out of school youth; and,
WHEREAS, 47% of Black men (20-24) and 20% of Hispanic men are jobless and out of school in Chicago; and,
WHEREAS, the situation is even worse for Chicago’s Black and Hispanic teens (16-19) with 88% of Blacks and
85% of Hispanic youth, compared to 71% nationwide; and,
WHEREAS, jobless rates for youth (20-24) are highest on the South and West Sides of the City of Chicago; and,
WHEREAS, until 2000, there was a national summer youth employment program that provided over 650,000
low-income youth with jobs; and,
WHEREAS, since then, there have been only sporadic programs that provide youth jobs in the summer and hardly
any programs to provide youth jobs throughout the year; and,
WHEREAS, joblessness leads to poverty, drug abuse, homelessness and violence in our communities; and,
WHEREAS, the persistence and severity of these conditions have ramifications for our young people and
generations to come, and;
WHEREAS, a national focus and program must be developed, along with state and local based programs, to give
the youth of our country the opportunity and skills they will need to become successful adults in an economy
growing more competitive each year.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Workforce, Housing and Community
Development Committee shall hold a hearing to discuss the findings of this report on the crisis of youth
unemployment.
BE IT FURTHER RESOVLED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners requests that the CEO of the
Chicago Cook Workforce Partnership attend the hearing to provide an update on available programming and
services for Cook County youth.
