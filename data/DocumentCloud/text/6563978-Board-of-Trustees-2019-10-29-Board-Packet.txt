RE:

Monthly Update

Board Members,
We are excited to become shovel ready and begin work on the capital projects you approved for this budget
cycle. Projects like the renovation of the north bus barn, demolition of the junkyard, and the construction of
the Independence Turn Around show your continued investment in our community and the services we
provide. As we hosted Summit County Council members Jeff Wilhite and Gloria Rogers on an OfficiallyOn-Board ride this month, they were excited to hear about the ITA investment, as well as the Flex Ride pilot
program, and they were extremely impressed with the new Ford Transit vans being used for demand
response service. All in all, the work being done by you and this team is definitely being noticed. We
continue to move METRO RTA into the future.
Yours in accessible transportation,

Dawn Distler
Executive Director

AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION

RECOGNITION
Mr. Alex Pavloff was introduced as the regional liaison for Ohio Secretary of State Frank
LaRose. He noted that the LaRose family, before they were involved in beverage distribution,
was actually involved in bussing, and public transportation has always been very important to
him and his family. Mr. LaRose was on the Public Transportation Committee for the Ohio
Senate. Mr. Pavloff offered congratulations to METRO for achieving 50 years in transit, and a
wish for 50 more years on behalf of the Ohio Secretary of State’s Office.
Next, Mr. Stephan Kremer was recognized for his service on the METRO Board of Trustees, as
he has been the longest sitting Board member. Mr. Kremer steps down from that position and
Mr. Rubino takes his place. Appreciation was extended for Mr. Kremer’s years of service to
METRO and for being an instrumental part of the Board. A gift was given to him in thanks for
his time of service. Mr. Vincent Rubino was then welcomed to METRO’s Board as the new

thanked her for her dedicated service to METRO.
Operators Lori Detweiler and Carolyn Edwards along with Road Supervisor Jeff Herman were
recognized for having stayed with an individual who was in medical distress, while located near

 the Rolling Acres Transit Center. Operators Detweiler and Edwards witnessed the driver of
another vehicle fall and hit their head. The Operators ran to check on the person, requested
assistance from Supervisor Herman, and stayed with the individual until paramedics arrived.
Their heroism went above and beyond their normal responsibilities, and their actions are
appreciated.

Mr. DeJournett noted a correction to the minutes that in the President’s Report he did not indicate

other wellness promoting services.

Chair: Louise Gissendaner
At Ms. Gissendaner’s request, Mr. Rector reported that the APD Group (Asset Protection and
Development) did meet. He reminded everyone that the United Way Benefits Fair would be held
October 17th. He indicated that the flexible hours which were added to the EEC were proving to
be very helpful. There were six (6) preventable accidents during August, and the distance

OFFICERS’ REPORT
President:
Mr. DeJournett expressed his appreciation for everyone who had been attending committee
meetings, where the bulk of work can be done. He asked that everyone continue to share
information with their appointing authority. He noted that he and Executive Director Dawn
Distler have been making the rounds to have meetings with all of those entities. It assists in
getting METRO in on the ground floor of projects.
Executive Director:
Ms. Distler pointed out that it had been exactly one year since she had attended her first METRO
Board meeting and had begun working here. She believes that we have built many partnerships
within the city that are needed. Our community is asking us to come to the table to be involved in
many of the projects that are being initiated. We are also getting the opportunity to explain how
our funding works, and how much is (or isn’t available). The identification of funds and grants
makes it possible to expand service. Ms. Distler agreed that the new committee structure is
working well. She thanked the entire team for their efforts.
OTHER BUSINESS
Ms. Distler presented for consideration Resolution 2019-12 in support of the renewal of a tax
levy benefitting County of Summit Alcohol, Drug Addiction and Mental Health Services (ADM)

 Operations Monthly Update – September 2019
The training hours for the month of September totaled 768. The training consisted of New Hire Training,
Refresher Training, Line Service training, Specialty Training, and mandatory training per the Preventable
Accident Policy.
On Tuesday, September 10, 2019, several members of the METRO Leadership Team attended The
Northeast Ohio Chapter of the WTS (Women’s Transportation Seminar) Annual Leadership Breakfast.
The breakfast was held at The International Women’s Air and Space Museum, Cleveland, Ohio.
The inaugural Greater Akron Inclusion Summit presented by the Greater Akron Chamber was a half-day
event held at the University of Akron Quaker Station on Thursday, September 12, 2019, from 7:30am11:30am. Members of the Leadership Team along with several members of the METRO Board of
Trustees had the opportunity to attend. Local and national business, civic, and community leaders
learned more about the economic impact of inclusion, the opportunities ahead of us, and the next steps
we must initiate to create an inclusive economy in Greater Akron.
Special thanks to the Executive Board Members of T.W.U. Local #1 for hosting the monthly Labor and
Management Meeting on Wednesday, September 18, 2019. The discussions were extremely productive
and informative. Jay Hunter, Director of Employee Engagement, has facilitated these meeting since the
inception this past June. Executive Board Members of T.W.U. and members of the Leadership Team
meet monthly to discuss service and routes, to share ideas, and to provide feedback from previous
meetings.
The Customer Experience and Service Performance Committee met on Wednesday, September 18, 2019

Tuesday, September 24, 2019 at the monthly Board Meeting.

 SEPTEMBER 2019 CUSTOMER CARE & MOBILITY SOLUTIONS MONTHLY REPORT
PARATRANSIT PASSENGERS
We transported a total of 23,032 passengers in the month of September on paratransit. Total number
of passengers transported September 2019 year-to-date is 204,710. This translates into 22,746
passengers transported monthly. We remain steady and level throughout 2019.
ON THE TABLE – AGING SENIOR CONVERSATION
In our role as senior citizen advocates, we held an On-The-Table discussion surrounding Aging Seniors on
Monday, September 30, 2019. We participated in Akron Community Foundation’s initiative by inviting
11 people to have an honest, open discussion about seniors in our community. We had a very lively
conversation from three foster grandparents, three METRO Operators who drive paratransit, one board
member, a representative from an Adult Day Services organization, a Senior Advocate with agency
knowledge, a representative from the community who has started many senior programs, and a dialysis
social worker. I was very proud of the work that was accomplished in a short period of time, and how
the invitees worked so well together, with all feeling free to contribute. It was a terrific experience, and
I look forward to hosting again next year.
COORDINATED INTAKE PILOT PROGRAM
METRO’s Paratransit team is part of Direction Home’s Coordinated Intake Pilot Program working to
coordinate services for those who have fallen through the cracks. Each partner will do a warm handoff
so the person seeking services does not have to make several phone calls and repeat their situation. We
continue to collaborate with our agency partners in finding ways to better serve our community. We
expect to put this pilot project in place on November 1st.
MOBILE TICKETING
We are all anxiously awaiting October 14, 2019, when mobile ticketing goes live for all METRO services.
Our team has spent a great deal of time getting ready, thanks to assistance from Planning and
Marketing. We are looking forward to making it a little easier for our passengers to ride METRO.
