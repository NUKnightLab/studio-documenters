Mr. Osiecki explained that the Management Plan policy statement was originally written and adopted by the ADAMHS
Board in 2015. Tami Fischer, Chief Administrative Officer, highlighted the revised draft that delineates the designated
Executive responsibility in the event of an extended absence of the Chief Executive Officer. The revised policy also

Administrative Offices and the Seasons of Hope House for calendar year 2019. She noted that the contract with

5. AUTHORIZATION TO ISSUE A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) FOR A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
Ms. Felicia Harrison, Chief Financial Officer, reported that the ADAMHS Board’s CEO and staff are requesting
authorization to issue a Request for Proposal for a behavioral health care management information system that will
support management of client enrollment, benefit management, provider contracting, payment processes and
utilization management. She explained that the system will essentially replace SHARES (Shared Health and Recovery
Enterprise System). The Board wishes to consider the option of contracting with another vendor that has a proven track
record of working with other Boards. Ms. Harrison noted that the plan is to release the RFP as soon as possible.
Board members expressed their frustration with the investment of time, effort and funds involved with the current
SHARES vendor. The Board Chair noted that specifics would be discussed later in the Executive Session; as a result,
action on this item would be tabled until after the Executive Session scheduled on the agenda.

6. RENOVATION OF ADAMHS BOARD’S 8TH FLOOR OFFICE SPACE
Ms. Fischer reported that the Chief Executive Officer recommended moving staff from the 7 th floor to the 8th floor to
promote a sense of teamwork, collaboration, and inclusion. Consequently, this concept will require reconfiguration of
the 8th floor office space. This arrangement will also allow NAMI Greater Cleveland to move from the 6th floor to the 7th
floor to have a larger space. Plans for the NAMI space on the 6th floor are being developed and may include a computer
training lab and space for utilization by peer support workers.
Ms. Fischer contacted ten construction companies for proposals. Of the ten construction companies contacted, only
five responded. Three companies actually kept their appointments and two of those three companies submitted written
proposals. Ms. Fischer reported that the recommendation is to contract with Sander Contracting, Inc. in an amount
not to exceed $30,000.00.
With regard to the cost of the project, Ms. Harrison confirmed that the administrative budget can accommodate the
expense of the renovation. Mr. Osiecki added that in the Board’s salary line item, an amount of $25,000.00 was
received from the state to support the staff costs in monitoring a grant project. Given this increase to the salary line
item, this amount can be removed from this line item in order to pay for renovation costs. Mr. Osiecki offered to take
interested Board members on a tour of the proposed office space changes after the meeting adjourns.
Motion to recommend approval of entering into a contract with Sander Contracting, Inc. in an amount not to
exceed $30,000.00 to renovate the ADAMHS Board’s 8th Floor Office Space to the Joint Planning & Finance
Committee. MOTION: R. Fowler / SECOND: E. Kirkland / AYES: B. Gohlstin, E. Kirkland, R. Fowler, E. Caraballo,
S. Killpack, M. Rodas, H. Snider / NAYS: None / Motion carried.
7. BRAINSTORMING SESSION
Rev. Gohlstin stated that he anticipates some new challenges in our community; therefore, additional funding will
most likely be required. He asked Board members for their input on how to tap into other funding streams.
Input received:
 Consider other possible local grant sources for various projects: Cleveland Foundation, Cleveland Jewish
Federation that has a significant endowment, Mt. Sinai Foundation, etc.
 Potential grant project might be to provide the Cleveland School System with Social Workers; this was
originally supported through a SAMHSA (Substance Abuse & Mental Health Services Administration) grant.
 Reassess programs and services currently funded to determine how we are spending our funds given the
areas of change in the community and in light of collaborative organizations revenue sources and decisions.
 Strive not to duplicate services in schools that are now being provided by other systems.
 The Board Chair recently spoke with Senator Sherrod Brown and inquired about the funds allocated to
address the Opiate Crisis. Senator Brown suggested that we should apply to the state for a portion of these
funds.
8. WELLNESS CENTER DISCUSSION - This discussion was tabled.
9. OLD/NEW BUSINESS
 As a follow-up to a previous discussion around Issue 1 to be placed on the November ballot, the Board Chair
read the amendment language aloud for the benefit of Executive Committee members. Rev. Gohlstin
explained that this language adds additional elements to the issue and varies from the original intent of the
Issue 1 framers.
