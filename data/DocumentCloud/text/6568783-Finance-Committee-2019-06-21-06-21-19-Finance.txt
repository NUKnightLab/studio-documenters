Contracts and Procurement Items (Attachment #1)

Charles Jones, Chief Procurement Officer, provided an overview of the contractual requests presented for the
Committee’s consideration. Dr. John Jay Shannon, Chief Executive Officer, and James Kiamos, Chief Executive
Officer, CountyCare, provided additional information. The Committee reviewed and discussed the requests.
During the discussion of request numbers 9 and 11, Board Chair Hammock expressed concerns that the Board has
not yet received a financial overview relating to Medicare expansion prior to these requests being presented for
approval; as Medicare reimbursements are different than Medicaid reimbursements, the Board should see the
financial analysis. Dr. Shannon noted that there is a time sensitivity associated with these contracts; he added that
the Strategic Plan that was approved in 2016 concluded that Cook County Health needed to develop a strategy for
its aging population.

 III. Action Items
B.

Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)

The Committee discussed whether Medicare expansion should be discussed in the Managed Care Committee,
Finance Committee, or with the full Board. Dr. Shannon suggested that another option is to include it on the
agenda of a Special Board Meeting for strategic planning discussions that is planned for July. He stated that he
will be meeting with Board Chair Hammock later today; they can further discuss and determine the best plan for
discussion of the subject.
It was determined that request numbers 9 and 11 would not be withdrawn or deferred at this time; Chair Reiter
stated that the Board can revisit them later, if needed.
Chair Reiter indicated that the reason or justification for sole source methodology should be included in the
transmittals presented for the Committee’s consideration.
Director Munar, seconded by Director Richardson-Lowry, moved the approval of
request numbers 1 through 20, subject to completion of review by Contract
Compliance, where appropriate. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

During the review of slide 4 of the report, the Committee discussed the different categories of operating revenue
and expenses relating to Access Payments and Access Expense. Chair Reiter requested that, for the category of

NEW PROPOSAL JUSTIFICATION: 
This is a grant award from the Illinois Department of Public Health to purchase Naloxone kits that will be dispensed

upon discharge from the Department of Corrections to individuals with Opioid Use Disorder.

 
   
     
 

In response to the rise in opioid-involved fatal and non-fatal overdoses, the Illinois Department of Public Health is
prioritizing the training and distribution of the lifesaving medication Naloxone to areas of the state with the highest
burden for opioid overdose.

 
    
   
    

The purpose of the Opioid Overdose Prevention Project is to expand naloxone education and distribution at Cermak.
The short term goals of this grant are to increase the number of individuals leaving the Department of Corrections with
access to naloxone and increase the number of individuals leaving trained on opioid overdose prevention. The long

term goal is to decrease the number of opioid overdoses in individuals leaving corrections.

NOTE: The difference between Number of Contract Awarded and Number of Contracts with Goals = Contracts assigned a Contract specific goal of zero.
This means that there were no certified MWBEs to provide the specific Good, Service or Equipment.

January numbers reflect Cardinal Health for Med/Surg supplies distribution at $18.2M
March reflects a waiver where the vendor did achieve 35% MBE/WBE indirect participation but indirect participation is only considered a good faith effort.
