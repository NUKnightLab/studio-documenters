II. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
A. PROJECT SUMMARY
1. Please provide a brief summary (3 – 5 sentences), in lay terms, of the purpose of the study
and the procedures subjects will undergo.
Researchers will complete an evaluation of the PERC program. The program offers intensive
business training and planning to formerly incarcerated/returning citizens and the opportunity
to receive a business loan to start their own business. The first component of the evaluation is
to conduct five focus groups with each of the five agencies that will conduct the business
training (and possible follow up interviews). The purpose is to better understand the training
aspect including its training structure and process.

ones used for the focus group; interviews will be used in the case of a key person being
absent from the focus group or if a key question was not sufficiently answered and follow up
is needed.
b.) Location(s) the study will be conducted with subjects, including a description, if applicable:
The focus groups will be held a private conference room at each of the agencies in Chicago
area.
c.) Amount of payment to subject, if any (consent form must note plan for payment if they

You are being asked to participate in a research study. Researchers are required to provide a
consent form such as this one to tell you about the research, to explain that taking part is
voluntary, to describe the risks and benefits of participation, and to help you to make an
informed decision. You should feel free to ask the researchers any questions you may have.
Principal Investigator Name and Title: Jessica Reichert, Senior Research Analyst
Department and Institution: Research and Evaluation Center, Illinois Criminal Justice
Information Authority, 300 W. Adams St., Suite 200, Chicago, IL 60606 or (312) 793-8550. This
project was funded by the Justice Assistance Program.
Why am I being asked?
You are being asked to be a subject in a research study about the Pathway to Enterprise for
Returning Citizens (PERC), which offers returning citizens business training and planning and
the opportunity to obtain a loan to start a business. You are being asked to participate in a focus
group to discuss your training experience and work with the program. The focus group will last
about one hour. You have been asked to participate in the research because you are involved in
the training aspect of the program.
Your participation in this research is voluntary. Your decision to participate will not affect your
current or future dealings with PERC or the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority
(Authority). You may skip any question you do not want to answer. If you decide to
participate, you are free to withdraw at any time without affecting those relationships. Five
focus groups will be held with each of the five agencies involved with PERC with approximately
10 persons per focus group. A total of 50 people may be involved in this research with the
Authority. The focus group will be audio recorded.
What is the purpose of this research?
Researchers at the Authority are evaluating PERC. PERC will offer returning citizens business
training and planning and the opportunity to obtain a loan to start a business. The focus group
will provide the Authority with information on the program.
What procedures are involved?
You will be asked to participate in a focus group discussion.
What are the potential risks and discomforts?
To the best of our knowledge, participating in the focus group will have no more risk of harm
than you would experience in everyday life. It is possible that some questions may make you
uncomfortable. It is your choice to answer any question. You may choose to participate in the
focus group even if you choose not to answer some of the focus group questions.
Will I be told about new information that may affect my decision to participate?
During the course of the study, you will be informed of any significant new research information
(either good or bad), such as changes in the risks or benefits resulting from participation in the
research or new alternatives to participation, that might cause you to change your mind about
continuing in the research. If new information is provided to you, your consent to continue
participating in this research may be re-obtained.

research are published, discussed, or presented to persons outside the research team. This
includes sharing specific, identifying information to those developing the program.
Recordings and transcripts will be destroyed three years following the completion of the
program evaluation.

Please know that although we will do everything possible to protect your identity, it is still possible
that someone may guess that you participated in a focus group. Other participants in your focus
group may share information with others about something you have said. Although the researchers
are unable to prevent other participants from sharing information about what was discussed, we will
do everything we can to ensure we do not release any information that can be directly linked to you.

What are the costs for participating in this research?
There are no costs to you for participating in this research.
Will I be reimbursed for any of my expenses or paid for my participation in this research?
There will be no payment or reimbursement for participation.

II. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
A. PROJECT SUMMARY
1. Please provide a brief summary (3 – 5 sentences), in lay terms, of the purpose of the study
and the procedures subjects will undergo.
The Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority (ICJIA) has received a federal grant from
the U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics to determine the historic recidivism
rates of the 29,620 individuals currently on the Illinois Sex Offender Registry (SOR), using
multiple sources of data. Of particular interest will be whether these recidivism rates differ by
type of sexually motivated crime, particularly regarding the characteristics of victims (child vs.
adult, male vs. female, etc.). Criminal History Record Information (CHRI) data will be matched
to persons listed on the SOR as of February 1, 2017, to determine their rates of re-arrest since
their first offense that mandated registration as a sex offender in Illinois. These records will also
be matched to any corresponding prison records from Illinois Department of Corrections
(IDOC) and the Illinois Department of Juvenile Justice (IDJJ) data, to allow for determination
of incarceration periods during which there was no risk of reoffending in the community. As a
further refinement of recidivism estimates, the 29,620 registrants will also be linked to Illinois

2

 Department of Public Health (IDPH) death certificate records. From these records, it will be
possible to determine if some proportion of SOR registration non-compliance is due to the
death of the person. Further, the manner and causes of death will be identified to potentially
inform more effective sex offender management. As most SOR registrants have lifetime
registration requirements, building systematic conduits for information on registrant deaths will
be important as the SOR population continues to age. The State Police will be informed of the
magnitude of underreporting of death events in the SOR, if any, at the end of the project. The
State Police Sex Offender Registration Unit will also provide another snapshot of the Sex
Offender Registry on February 1, 2018, in order to be able to assess the extent to which
registrant information changes over the typical yearly registration period. This new registrant
list (estimated to be of similar magnitude to the 29,620 individuals registered in 2017) will be
matched to the 2017 registrant list, as well as the CHRI, corrections and death record systems in
order to determine any changes to recidivism rates established on the 2017 registrant group. It
is estimated that 1,000 more unique individuals will appear on the 2018 SOR compared to the
2017 list, bringing the total number of subjects to an estimated 30,620 individuals.

B. PROCEDURES
2. Describe the procedures involving human subjects and list the steps you will take.

II. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
A. PROJECT SUMMARY
1. Please provide a brief summary (3 – 5 sentences), in lay terms, of the purpose of the study
and the procedures subjects will undergo.
The research will measure if the workshop met its goals. The findings may be used to improve
future workshops and inform other jurisdictions on holding workshops/training on countering
violent extremism (CVE) and targeted violence prevention (TVP).
There are four components to the study:
1. Workshop observations: Workshop observations to document workshop content and
questions asked during the workshop.
2. Pre-workshop and post-workshop surveys: Paper and pen pre- and post-workshop
surveys will be used to document knowledge attainment and perceptions of the
workshop.
3. 3-month post-workshop follow-up survey: An online, 3-month post-workshop follow-up
survey will be used to gauge knowledge retention and information use.
4. 3-months post-workshop phone interviews: 3-month post-workshop phone interviews to
obtain additional detail about information usage and how the workshop can be

2

 improved.

B. PROCEDURES
2. Describe the procedures involving human subjects and list the steps you will take.
Include the following information:
a.) Time involvement of subjects:

Workshop observations: N/a
Pre-workshop and post-workshop surveys: The pre/post surveys will take approximately
5 minutes each.
3-month post-workshop follow-up survey: The follow-up survey will take approximately
8 minutes to complete.
3-months post-workshop phone interviews: The interviews will take approximately 30
minutes to complete.
b.) Location(s) the study will be conducted with subjects, including a description, if
applicable:
Workshop observations: Observations will occur on site at the designated workshop
location.
Pre-workshop and post-workshop surveys: The pre/post surveys will be handed out to
participants at the workshop.
3-month post-workshop follow-up survey: The follow-up survey will be web-facilitated
and can be completed in a location convenient to the participant.
3-months post-workshop phone interviews: Follow-up interviews will be completed over
the phone at a location/date/time convenient to the participant.
c.) Amount of payment to subject, if any (consent form must note plan for payment if they
withdraw voluntarily):
There will be no payment to subjects for any component of this study.
d.) What subjects will experience or do:
Workshop observations: N/a
Pre-workshop and post-workshop surveys: Participants will be asked to complete the
surveys prior to and after the workshop. The surveys will focus on their knowledge
about key issues/concepts/processes related to serving individuals who may be at risk for
ideologically inspired violence, concerns they may have serving these individuals, and
perceptions of the workshop content.
3-month post-workshop follow-up survey: Participants will be asked to complete the on3

 line survey. The survey will focus on whether the knowledge obtained during the
workshop has been retained and whether the information has been useful or shared with
others.
3-months post-workshop phone interviews: Individuals may opt in to participating in a
phone interview. They may also choose to be audio recorded. Interviews will focus on
whether the knowledge obtained during the workshop has been retained, whether the
information has been useful or shared with others, and how the workshop could be
improved.

3-months post-workshop phone interviews: Individuals will be asked to voluntarily agree to
participate in follow-up phone interviews. Those who choose to participate will also be asked
if the interview can be audiotaped.
There will be an inform consent document (see Phone Interview Consent Form) provided to
individuals who voluntarily agree to participate in follow-up phone interviews. This inform
consent document will tell participants about their right to choose to be audiotaped and how
the audio recordings will be used, stored, and disposed of should they consent to being audio
recorded. The participant will be provided the informed consent document several days in
advance of their scheduled phone interview. The interviewer will go over the informed
consent document prior to the interview. If the individual verbally agrees to participate, the
interviewer will separately ask permission to audio record the interview. The interview will
be audiotaped only if the participant verbally consents to being audiotaped.
Once the interview is completed, the audio recording will be transferred from the recording
device to a password protected folder on a secure server accessible only to research staff
associated with this project. The audio recording will be deleted from the recording device
after successful transfer to the secure server. The recording will be stored for 3 years, per
federal regulation (45 CFR 46), at which point the audio recordings will be destroyed.
The interviews will be transcribed by research staff on this project. No identifying
information will be included in the recording transcription. The transcripts will be maintained
separately from the audio recordings in a password protected folder on a secure server
accessible only to research staff on this project.

below.
Yes

x

No

a.) Where will the names or other individual identifiers be recorded (e.g., on test protocols,
on a separate list with code numbers, etc)?
Workshop observations: No names or individual identifiers will be recorded during the
observations. Researchers will document the workshop content and questions asked by
participants. Researchers will record all information in a manner that protects the identities
of the participants, including details in any questions that could be potentially identifying.
This includes, but is not limited to, documenting participant names, agencies where they
work, or service areas.
Pre-workshop and post-workshop surveys: No names or individual identifiers will be
recorded. Participants will be asked to create a private identification code known only to
them. This code will be used to match the pre/post surveys.
3-month post-workshop follow-up survey: Workshop organizers will provide the
researchers the participants’ e-mails on a separate excel spreadsheet. The e-mails will be
used to administer the follow-up surveys. The e-mails will only be used to distribute the
online survey; all survey responses are anonymous using the same private identification
code noted above (see Pre-workshop and Post-workshop surveys).
3-months post-workshop phone interviews: At the end of the follow-up survey they will be
asked if they are interested in participating in a phone interview. If the individual responds
they would like to participate, the individual will be prompted to provide contact
information. The contact information will be recorded in a separate file from the survey data
using Qualtrics, an on-line survey software. This information will only be used to follow-up
with the participant for the phone interview.
