Recommendation
It is recommended that the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority (CHA)
authorize the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) or his designee to: 1) Approve Oakwood Boulevard
Associates, LLC as Developer for the Ida B. Wells, Darrow Homes, Wells Extension and Madden
Park Homes Phase III Site; 2) Enter into a Development Agreement for the Mixed-Income
Development; and 3) Execute and deliver such other documents and perform such actions as
may be necessary or appropriate to implement the foregoing.
The requested action in this item complies in all material respects with all applicable CHA Board
policies and all applicable federal procurement regulations. Staff have completed all necessary
due diligence to support the submission of this initiative.
Funding
None
Background
It is the intent of the CHA to implement a sustainable, community-sensitive revitalization
program with the goal of creating a vibrant community on the remaining vacant CHA land that
was formerly part of the Ida B. Wells, Darrow Homes, Wells Extension, and Madden Park
Homes (“Madden/Wells/Darrow”) public housing developments. These public housing
developments originally contained approximately 3,267 units located on approximately 94
acres of land. CHA demolished the original structures by 2006. Over the last twelve years, CHA
has worked in collaboration with its development partners, Oakwood Boulevard Associates
(“OBA”) and Granite Partners for Oakwood Boulevard (“GPOB”), to create 863 mixed-income
housing units in the new Oakwood Shores development on a portion of the site.

 Procurement
Rental Development. On June 11, 2001, a request for proposal (“RFP”) was issued for the
planning, redevelopment, and management of Phase 1 of a new mixed-income community
formerly containing portions of each of the Madden/Wells/Darrow developments. The
Community Builders (TCB) and Granite Development Corporation were selected as developers
and sponsors for the Phase 1 rental and homeownership development and subsequently it was
decided that they would only construct the rental portion of the redevelopment. The sponsors
along with Ujima formed OBA development entity to enter into a Contract for Redevelopment
of Phase 1 Rental.
Additionally, pursuant to the 2001 RFP, the Authority reserved the right to expand the selected
developer’s role to include development of further phases. In April 2007 OBA was awarded
Phase 2 of the rental portion of the redevelopment, and CHA entered into a Contract for
Redevelopment of Madden/Wells/Darrow Phase II Rental. To date, OBA successfully completed
the construction of the Phase 1 rental site and four of the five sub-phases of the Phase 2 rental
contract with the fifth sub-phase in its planning stage. A total of 789 rental units have been
completed on the Oakwood Shores site, of which 336 are for CHA families.
For-Sale Development. On July 21, 2003, an RFP was issued for for-sale residential housing at
Madden/Wells/Darrow. The scope of work focused on the development of for-sale residential
housing units in a mixed income setting and included units reserved for public housing
residents.
On November 21, 2003, the GPOB received notice of its selection as the developer for
Madden/Wells/Darrow For Sale Phase 1. On October 1, 2005, the Authority and GPOB executed
the Development Agreement for Madden Wells Phase 1 Homeownership development. GPOB
planned to build 129 for sale units. They completed 74 homeownership units as part of a
development phase referred to as The Arches at Oakwood Boulevard.
In September 2016, Granite Development Corp. as the managing member of GPOB, requested
to remove MB Real Estate Services as a member of the for-sale Phase 1 development team, and
replace them with TCB. These changes are to be incorporated in a First Amendment to the
Development Agreement for Madden Wells Phase 1 Homeownership.
Development Plan and Area
To date, an area roughly bounded by 37th Street (north), 39th Street (south), Lake Park Place
(east), and Rhodes Ave. (west) has been partially developed. The development area has
considerable vacant lots remaining that need to be developed to complete the new community.
In 2018, a master plan was completed for the site with a recommendation for the completion
of what the planning group designated the “core of the Site.” CHA has been working with OBA
and agrees that they are the right team to finish this core area.
