PRESENTATION / DISCUSSION ITEMS
Complete and Green Streets Policy
8248c
1-2

 Ms. Sarli provided background on complete and green streets and reviewed the following:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Anatomy of a complete street
Anatomy of a green street
National land cover data that includes impervious surface in NOACA’s fivecounty region
Local examples of complete and green streets policies
Benefits of complete and green streets
Reason for having a stand alone complete and green streets policy
Goals of the draft Complete and Green Streets Policy
Requirements and exceptions

Ms. Sarli welcomed comments from the Subcommittee. She stated that the draft policy
was included in the meeting packet and will be presented at the Policy Committee meeting
on July 12, 2019.
Mr. Rick Switalski asked if there is funding available to cover the complete and green
streets elements. Ms. Sarli said the policy will allow sponsors to apply for funding.
Engineer Conrad suggested that staff change the word “must” to “may be considered” in
the policy when recommending signage or striping for pedestrians and bicyclists as part
of a resurfacing project. Ms. Sarli said the language will be changed in the policy.
Mr. Switalski asked if there would be a problem if a road is not on the bike plan. Ms. Sarli
stated that not every complete street has to have a bike lane. She noted that the
recommendations will depend on the context of the community and roadway.
Ms. Grace Gallucci asked the Subcommittee to think of complete streets more
conceptually. She said NOACA cannot rehabilitate, expand or build roads that will not
serve everyone regardless of the community mode. She said transportation is not just
about getting from Point A to Point B, it is also intended to be used as a tool for people to
access life and improve the overall economic opportunities for everyone.

Mr. Thompson presented a list of 2019 CMAQ funding requests totaling $29.4 million for
projects that have a total cost of $37 million. He stated that there is no financial impact at
this time and action does not approve the proposed funding or implementation schedule
of the projects. Mr. Thompson stated that staff will evaluate the applications and present
recommendations to the Planning and Programming Committee in July 2019.
8248c
1-3

 SFY 2021-2024 TIP Development – Potential Projects for NOACA Funds
Mr. Randy Lane stated that the Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) is a
compilation of projects to be implemented using federal-aid funding over a four-year
period. The SFY 2021-2024 TIP contains road, bridge, public transit and other
transportation projects supported by federal funds through NOACA, ODOT and transit
agencies.
Mr. Lane stated that the universe of projects are evaluated for NOACA administered
funding and is developed through a comprehensive needs assessment process. Overall,
nearly 700 projects totaling more than $1 billion were identified.
Mr. Lane reviewed the following work that needs to be done for the project evaluation
approach:
•
•
•
•
•

Filter preservation projects
Incorporate all other qualifying plan list project types
Evaluate with regional significance criteria (completed)
Evaluate projects against other considerations (in progress)
Create a draft list of projects proposed for further evaluation by work type, including
preservation, safety and congestion, and transportation alternatives

Mr. Lane stated that staff will continue to evaluate potential projects for NOACA’s
administered funds. He noted that project funding recommendations will be presented to
the Planning and Programming Committee on July 12, 2019, and to the Board for approval
on September 13, 2019.
Mr. Lane stated that staff will work with the sponsors of approved projects to finalize the
scopes, schedules and budgets for incorporation into the draft SFY 2021-2024 TIP. The
final draft TIP will be presented to the Planning and Programming Committee for approval
on January 17, 2020, and to the Board for approval on March 6, 2020.
Engineer Conrad asked what PCRs were used. Mr. Lane said 2016 and mentioned that
the system automatically projects PCRs based on degradation curves to the year of
implementation. Mr. Lane also noted that the 2018 data was released by ODOT within
the last two months and NOACA staff has been spot checking the needs against that data
and realized there has been good success with the degradation curves.
Engineer Conrad asked if staff utilized the cost estimates from the sponsors. Ms. Gallucci
said yes. Mr. Lane stated that staff considered the cost of administration and inflation to
the appropriate year and a 10% contingency.
Ms. Feke asked members to submit questions or comments to staff on any of the agenda
items.
Transportation Review Advisory Council (TRAC) Regional Priorities
Ms. Sarli stated that TRAC is accepting project applications that have a total cost greater
than $12 million that add transportation capacity or reduce congestion, and are critical to
mobility, economic development, and quality of life of citizens.

8248c

TO:

NOACA Transportation Subcommittee

FROM:

Grace Gallucci, Executive Director

DATE:

September 13, 2019

RE:

Project Planning Reviews – 2nd Quarter State Fiscal Year (SFY) 2020

ACTION REQUESTED
The Subcommittee is asked to consider recommending the 2nd Quarter Project Planning Reviews (PPRs) to
the Planning and Programming Committee at its October 2019 meeting.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION
Attached are PPR summary documents for the proposed projects to be presented to the NOACA Planning
and Programming Committee and Executive Committee for review and recommendation.
NOACA’s Board approved Regional Transportation Investment Policy requires that all proposed federal-aid
transportation projects be processed through PPR in order to meet NOACA’s adopted goals and federal
requirements.
PPR consists of four levels of review: NOACA staff; Board, including committees, subcommittees, and
councils: intergovernmental review and consultation (IGRC); and public involvement. The end product of
PPR is a Board resolution that certifies that the project has had thorough review, allowing the project to
proceed to the programming stages of the planning process.
As part of the PPR process, a detailed summary of the proposed improvement and staff and committee
assessment of the project are posted on NOACA’s website, www.NOACA.org. A link to the PPRs is
included on the home page by clicking the ‘Comment on Projects’ button. Staff adds comments obtained
from the public, governmental organizations and NOACA committees as they are received. Proposed
projects are posted on the website for three months, allowing adequate time for review and comment.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Pending Board approval, the project sponsor will be notified that their project has completed PPR. NOACA
staff will work with the project sponsor to address any planning issues identified during PPR.

 RTA Fiscal Year 2020 Capital Grant Program
Sponsor: RTA
Estimated Total Cost: $54,519,373
Proposed Source of Federal Funds: Federal Transit Administration (FTA)
History/Background: RTA reports that its original state fiscal year (SFY) 2020 grant program is
listed in the NOACA SFY 2018 – 2021 Transportation Improvement Program and the majority of
the program is as originally proposed in the TIP. RTA is adding four new projects to its FFY 2020
program and the TIP. RTA is also seeking to revise and amend five existing grants to address
under-runs, over-runs, and revised priorities in its capital program impacting eleven TIP projects.
RTA’s revisions to the FFY 2019 and 2017 Capital Formula and FFY 2016 State of Good Repair
grant programs reflect these revisions.
Proposed Project: RTA is applying for various sources of funds including Section 5307 Capital
Formula, Section 5337 State of Good Repair Formula and Section 5339 Bus and Bus Facilities
Formula for FFY 2020, as described below:
•

The Section 5307 Capital Formula projects include Bus Replacement Program Vehicles
and Spare Parts, Substation Improvement Program, Cuyahoga Viaduct Track Bridge, Light
Rail Track Rehabilitation, Bus Spare Parts Program, Rail State of Good Repair, Bus
Preventive Maintenance, Enhanced Rail ADA (Americans with Disabilities) Access, NOACA
Unserved Areas Projects, (new) Rail Car Replacement Program, (new) Track Bridge over
Conrail and (new) HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) System Improvement
Program.

•

Section 5337 Rail Formula projects include Substation Improvement Program, Cuyahoga
Viaduct Track Bridge, Light Rail Track Rehabilitation, Rail Spare Parts Program, Rail State
of Good Repair Projects, Rail Preventive Maintenance, Rail Infrastructure Program, On-Call
Rail Engineering, OCS (Overhead Catenary System) Rehabilitation Program and (new) Rail
Utility Vehicle Prime Mover Replacement.

•

Section 5339 Bus and Bus Facilities Formula projects include Bus Replacement Program
Vehicles and Spare Parts.

RTA is also seeking to revise and amend five existing grants to address updated funding amounts,
projected under-runs, over-runs and revised priorities in its Capital Program as described below:
•

2019 Section 5307 Capital Formula Grant – The grant is being revised and amended to
account for decreased funding as well as to decrease Bus Preventive Maintenance and
NOACA Unserved Area funding, shift Bus Vehicle Type funding, fund the West 117th Street
Track Bridge and its Rail Car Replacement Program.

•

2019 Section 5337 State of Good Repair Formula Grant – The grant is being revised and
amended to account for decreased funding as well as to decrease Rail Preventive
Maintenance and West 117th Street Track Bridge funding and fund the Rail Car
Replacement Program.

•

2019 Section 5339 Bus and Bus Facilities Formula Grant – The grant is being revised and
amended to account for increased funding and to increase the funding for Bus
Replacement Program Vehicles.

5 - 10

 •

2017 Section 5307 Capital Formula Grant – The grant is being revised and amended to
account for separating the design and construction phase costs for Light Rail Signal
System, from East 79th Street to Shaker Square.

•

2016 Section 5337 State of Good Repair Grant - The grant is being revised and amended
due to under-runs in the West Park Diamond Crossover and Red Line West Track
Rehabilitation projects and to fund the (new) Rail Utility Vehicle Prime Mover Replacement.

MEMORANDUM
TO:

NOACA Transportation Subcommittee

FROM:

Grace Gallucci, Executive Director

DATE:

September 13, 2019

RE:

Plan and TIP Amendments – 2nd Quarter State Fiscal Year (SFY) 2020

ACTION REQUESTED
The Transportation Committee is asked to consider recommending 2nd Quarter Plan and TIP
amendments to the Planning and Programming Committee at its October 2019 meeting.
BACKGROUND
The proposed amendments to the Transportation Plan (Plan) and the state fiscal year (SFY) 2018
– 2021 Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) are being processed through project planning
review (PPR). The projects include roadway projects sponsored by the City of Brecksville and the
Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) and transit projects sponsored by GCRTA.
The proposed amendments also include a project sponsored by Laketran processed through
project planning review (Resolution 2019-014) and amended to the TIP (Resolution 2019-015).
The project (LAK WICKLIFFE PARK & RIDE LOT RECONSTRUCTION: PID No. 108885)
involves reconstruction of the park and ride lot in Wickliffe to accommodate electric charging
infrastructure. The cost of the reconstruction of the park and ride lot was originally estimated at
$750,000, but is now estimated to be $2,350,000, which encompasses $944,816 in Section
5307 funding and the remainder in Laketran local share. The increase is over the maximum
allowable threshold for a project this size.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The cost of the proposed projects being amended to the Plan and TIP is $226 million. Funding
for these projects is committed and/or planned from a variety of federal, state, and local sources.
Federal funding is provided by the Federal Highway Administration and the Federal Transit
Administration and administered through the Ohio Department of Transportation.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Pending Board approval, the amendments will be incorporated into the NOACA Plan and/or
statewide TIP amendment in January 2020.

MEMORANDUM
TO:

NOACA Transportation Subcommittee

FROM:

Grace Gallucci, Executive Director

DATE:

September 13, 2019

RE:

Functional Classification Amendment Recommendations

ACTION REQUESTED
The Transportation Subcommittee is asked to consider recommending the functional
classification amendments to the Planning and Programming Committee at its October 2019
meeting.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION FOR CURRENT ACTION
The Ohio Department of Transportation has requested the following functional classification
amendments:
•
•
•
•

Remove E 30th, from I-77 WB exit ramp to Broadway; Broadway (SR 14), from E 30th to
E 14th; and E14th Street, from Broadway to Orange Ave., from the I-90 WB Intermodal
Connector OH 56T (Tower City).
Add Prospect Ave., from the I-90 WB exit ramp to Tower City to the I-90 WB Intermodal
Connector OH 56T (Tower City).
Revise 500 feet of E14th Street, from Broadway Ave. to Orange Ave., from a principal
arterial to a major collector.
Add 210 feet of SR 87 – Shaker Boulevard in both directions to Connector OH 82T from
the RTA station at approximately E 130th Street to the east leg of the Shaker Square
Loop (CR 62) which will also join with Connector OH 84T.

Functional Classification is the grouping of roads, streets, and highways in a hierarchy based on
the type of highway service they provide. Streets and highways are part of an interconnected
network, and each one plays a role in moving traffic throughout the system. Generally, streets
and highways provide either traffic mobility or land access and can be ranked in terms of the
proportion of service they perform.
In June 2014 the NOACA Board of Directors approved Resolution Number 2014-025, which
created a NOACA functional classification policy for the review of proposed functional
classification revisions. The policy requires all proposed functional classification revisions to be
5 - 27

 evaluated thoroughly prior to making a recommendation to the Ohio Department of
Transportation. Evaluation is based on guidelines suggested by the Federal Highway
Administration (FHWA) and the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) with some criteria
refined to reflect local conditions. Criteria evaluated includes:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Lane widths
Shoulder widths
Average Annual Daily Traffic (AADT)
Access
Speed limit
Parallel spacing of routes
Area type
Percentage of mileage by functional classification (by region, by county)
Functional classification density analysis

Based on the NOACA Functional Classification Amendment Policy, Staff recommends the
proposed ODOT amendments.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
No financial impact, but approval of the functional classification recommendations could add
additional mileage to the federal-aid network.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Pending Board approval, these recommendations will be forwarded to ODOT and FHWA for
further review and implementation.

RE:

Safety Performance Target Setting for CY 2020

ACTION REQUESTED
The Subcommittee is asked to consider recommending this item to the Policy Committee at its October 2019
meeting. This action updates safety performance targets approved by the Board of Directors (Resolution
2019-022) for the current 2018-2021 Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) and the AIM Forward 2040
Long Range Transportation Plan.
BACKGROUND
Safety Performance Management (Safety PM) is part of the overall Transportation Performance
Management (TPM) program, which FHWA defines as a strategic approach that uses system information to
make investment and policy decision to achieve national performance goals. It establishes safety
performance measure requirements for the purpose of carrying out the State’s Highway Safety
Improvement Plan (HSIP) and to assess fatalities and serious injuries on all public roads.
The federal Safety PM Final Rule established five performance measures as the five-year rolling averages
to include:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

Number of Fatalities
Rate of Fatalities per 100 million Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT)
Number of Serious Injuries
Rate of Serious Injuries per 100 million VMT
Number of Non-motorized Fatalities and Non-motorized Serious Injuries

The Safety PM Final Rule also establishes the process for State Departments of Transportation (DOTs) and
Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) to establish and report their safety targets.
State DOT’s are required to adopted targets annually. MPOs are required to establish targets within of 180
days and shall represent the anticipated outcomes for the same calendar year as the State DOT target (23
U.S.C. 134(h)(2)). MPO targets can be established through one of two options:
1. Agree to plan and program projects so that they contribute toward the accomplishment of the State
DOT safety target for a safety performance measure, or
2. Commit to a quantifiable target for a safety performance measure for the metropolitan planning area.
5 - 29

 NOACA adopted ODOT’s calendar year 2018 target of a 1% reduction for each of the five performance
measures consistent with the first option above. For calendar year 2018, NOACA’s 1-year performance in
each of the 5 performance measures is presented in the table below. It can be seen that fatalities, serious
injuries, and non-motorized fatalities all declined versus the previous three years, reversing the prior trend
of increasing FSI’s since 2014.

Fatalities

Within the NOACA region, frequency targets for Fatalities and Non-Motorized FSI’s were not met, in spite of
significant reductions in fatalities and serious injuries in 2018. This is because the targets are established
and reported using 5-year rolling averages, not annual crash frequencies, and the frequencies included in
the rolling averages for 2018 were greater than the ones replaced from 2013. The rate-based target for
fatalities was also not met, largely for the same reason.
ODOT has established a 2% reduction for each of the five performance areas for calendar year 2020, an
increase from 1% versus last year. A rate of 2% reflects a more aggressive approach toward reducing
crashes that reflects the 2% reductions recommended for emphasis areas in NOACA’s SAVE Plan. Staff
recommends that NOACA adopt ODOT’s target of a 2% reduction for calendar year 2020 to support state
targets for safety performance.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact.
5 - 30

 CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Pending Board approval, the AIM Forward 2040 plan and current FY 2018-2021 TIP will be amended to
reflect the 2020 adopted safety targets. Staff will support these targets by working to implement the
recommendations and strategies outlined in “SAVE: NOACA’s Regional Safety Action Plan.”

Enhanced Mobility for Seniors and Individuals With Disabilities (Section 5310)
Program Update

ACTION REQUESTED
No action is requested at this time. This item is included for information and presentation only.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION
The Enhanced Mobility for Seniors and Individuals with Disabilities (Section 5310) Program addresses the
special transportation needs of seniors and individuals with disabilities. NOACA seeks to eliminate barriers
and improve transportation options in Northeast Ohio for older adults, individuals with disabilities, and
people of low income through the coordination of resources and efforts of public transit operators, human
service agencies, and other transportation providers. Furthermore, NOACA will encourage the efficient and
effective use of resources by eliminating gaps and redundancies in transportation services.
The total amount apportioned to the region for federal fiscal year 2019 was $ 1,809,255, of which $ 180,925
(10%) will be retained by NOACA for program planning and administration. The remaining $ 1,628,330 is
available to be programmed for new capital project recommendations. Capital projects are funded at 80%
with a 20% local match from awardees. NOACA has designated at least 60% of funding for transit agency
project proposals and up to 40% for non-profits, for-profits, and government agencies awarded through a
competitive application process. Transit agencies are eligible for operations funding at 50% federal funding
with a 50% local match.

MEMORANDUM
TO:

NOACA Transportation Subcommittee

FROM:

Grace Gallucci, Executive Director

DATE:

September 13, 2019

RE:

NOACA Project Maintenance Monitoring Program

ACTION REQUESTED
No action is being requested. This item is being presented for information and discussion.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION
NOACA administers the Surface Transportation Block Grant (STBG) program and the STBG
set-aside for the Transportation Alternatives (TAP) program. NOACA also administers
Congestion Mitigation Air Quality (CMAQ) funding as a member of the Ohio Statewide CMAQ
committee.
In accordance with federal and state provisions (notably 23 United States Code, Section 116),
once a project is completed, the sponsoring agency is required to maintain the project to an
acceptable standard. Under the project agreement, the sponsoring agency has the responsibility
to provide adequate maintenance activities for the project.
The term “maintenance” means the preservation of the entire facility within the original termini
and scope of the project. The term “adequate maintenance” means maintenance necessary for
the safe and efficient utilization of the completed project as designed.
As the program manager of the above referenced federal funds, the NOACA Governing Board
has expressed concerns over how the maintenance of the projects to which it has committed
funding is monitored. The Board wants to ensure that the approved project’s intended public
benefit is received and being maintained for the duration of the project’s determined useful life.
At the July 2018 Policy Committee meeting, staff proposed the creation of a Project
Maintenance Monitoring Program that would allow for NOACA to demonstrate that adequate
maintenance is being performed and any issues as a result of non-maintenance are being
addressed. The program would provide for an annual review of projects previously implemented
with NOACA funds to ensure compliance and consistency with the Board approved scope and
intended public benefit.
To best guide and advance implementation of the program, specific policies will need to be
developed and adopted by the agency. The policy would address components of the proposed
program including, but not limited to, the following:
•
•
•

Monitoring method and frequency;
Scope of maintenance performance reviews
Recommendations and measures to address and correct identified deficiencies; and
6-5

 •

Assurance for compliance

Staff will present potential policy components to the Subcommittee at its September 20, 2019
meeting. Staff will use the input received from the Subcommittee to develop a draft policy
document that will be brought at a future meeting for continued input.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Staff will use Subcommittee input to further develop a policy to guide the establishment and
performance of Project Maintenance Monitoring Program.
