1. WPB Ambassador Program and Policy was reviewed with the following adjustments to be made:
- Remove “vendor” information on application and put information about the person who is
applying to be the ambassador
- Review and amend the forms and policies to remove language around safety/security/crime
- Recirculate the survey from last year to John Paige
- Clarify how many people we would like the ambassadors to observe during a pedestrian
count
- Ensure that ambassadors can be walking around all corridors including Western Ave
- The committee will review all applications as they come in on case by case basis, as funding
in the line item permits
- Private security rebate will still be available but not advertised as part of this program
- Send Elizabeth Neukrich information about other best practice Ambassador programs
around the country to assist with preparation of her press release
