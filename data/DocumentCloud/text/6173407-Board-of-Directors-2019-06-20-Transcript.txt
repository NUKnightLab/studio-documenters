 ·1· ·the parties.· A copy of the written order will be
·2· ·posted on the Board's website.
·3· · · · · · ·There is one additional disciplinary
·4· ·matter to announce.· Board member O'Malley will
·5· ·report on this matter.
·6· · · ·MR. O'MALLEY:· Thank you, President Foreman.
·7· · · · · · ·Pursuant to Section 2-78-130 of the
·8· ·Municipal Code of Chicago, I considered one matter
·9· ·on which the Chief Administrator of the Civilian
10· ·Office of Police Accountability and the
11· ·Superintendent of Police did not agree regarding
12· ·the discipline of three officers.
13· · · · · · ·The Chief Administrator recommended that
14· ·Sergeant Tracy Walczak and Police Officer Danielle
15· ·Ferlito be discharged from the Chicago Police
16· ·Department for failing to report and making false
17· ·statements about an altercation they witnessed
18· ·involving fellow off-duty officers.· The
19· ·Superintendent did not agree that the evidence was
20· ·sufficient to prove they made false statements and
21· ·recommended that they be suspended for 45 days.
22· · · · · · · In addition, the Chief Administrator
23· ·recommended a 45-day suspension of Detective Jose
24· ·Cardo for failing to conduct a thorough

YVer1f

 ·1· ·investigation of the incident.· The Superintendent
·2· ·recommended 20 days.
·3· · · · · · · In my opinion, the Superintendent did
·4· ·not meet the burden of overcoming the Chief
·5· ·Administrator's recommendations for discipline for
·6· ·these three officers.
·7· · · · · · ·The written opinion for Request for
·8· ·Review numbers 19 RR 09 through 11 will be posted
·9· ·on the Board's website as required by the Municipal
10· ·Code of Chicago.
11· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· Thank you.
12· · · · · · ·The general orders and other directives
13· ·issued by the Superintendent of Police during the
14· ·previous month are listed in the books made
15· ·available at this evening's meeting and are posted
16· ·on the Police Department's website.
17· · · · · · · Next up is the Superintendent's report
18· ·to the Board.
19· · · ·CHIEF WALLER:· All right.· Thank you, President
20· ·Foreman and members of the Board.
21· · · · · · ·Superintendent Johnson sends his regrets
22· ·for not being here tonight.· He's currently
23· ·attending an out-of-town affair on officers'
24· ·wellness and suicide.· So he regrets not being

 ·1· ·here.
·2· · · · · · · I would like to take a moment to update
·3· ·you on the progress CPD is making on several key
·4· ·performance issues.· Under the Office of Community
·5· ·Policing, CPD held a series of community
·6· ·conversations with over 1400 hundred residents in
·7· ·each of our 22 districts throughout Chicago.· The
·8· ·dialog in these meetings resulted in development of
·9· ·22 community policing strategic plans, one for each
10· ·district.
11· · · · · · · These strategic plans outline the
12· ·District's four crime reduction priorities, as well
13· ·as community engagement and collaborative community
14· ·building goals for the next year.
15· · · · · · ·In addition to working to improve our
16· ·community policing efforts, we are also working to
17· ·improve the quality of field training and
18· ·mentorship of our new officers.· We strive for a
19· ·one/one ratio of field training officer to
20· ·probationary officer.
21· · · · · · ·And just to add some context to that, we
22· ·haven't had a lot of field training officers.
23· ·Well, people applied for that position, so we are
24· ·up almost up to -- we're about 90 percent one-to

McCorkle Litigation Services, Inc.
Chicago, Illinois· (312) 263-0052

YVer1f

 ·1· ·one.· So that's a good ratio for the training.
·2· · · · · · ·We administered an FTO exam, that's a
·3· ·field training officer examination, and we have
·4· ·another exam scheduled for July which will help us
·5· ·increase the number of field training officers
·6· ·available to train and mentor our young officers
·7· ·serving, protecting, and patrolling our
·8· ·neighborhoods.
·9· · · · · · · Finally, it was recently reported that
10· ·CPD had made no progress on improving our school
11· ·resource officer program.· In reality, we have been
12· ·working diligently to comply with the requirements
13· ·set forth in the consent decree.· Before the
14· ·beginning of the next school year, CPD will have a
15· ·revised policy for school resource officers that
16· ·make crystal clear that officers will have no role
17· ·in routine school disciplinary matters.· This
18· ·policy will be informed by the many community
19· ·meetings that were held throughout the City on this
20· ·matter.
21· · · · · · · In addition, we will update our school
22· ·resource officer selection criteria to ensure that
23· ·the officers in our schools are well suited for
24· ·that assignment.· They will be better trained, and

 ·1· ·the training, which is something that we've never
·2· ·done before, will include things -- an outreach for
·3· ·from the students when we can recognize if a
·4· ·student is having a problem or something like that.
·5· ·It will be a lot more intensified with their
·6· ·training.
·7· · · · · · · Finally, we continue working with CPS on
·8· ·a memorandum of understanding to define the roles
·9· ·and responsibilities of our school resource
10· ·officers who work inside Chicago Public School
11· ·facilities.· Thank you.
12· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· Thank you, Chief.
13· · · · · · · To reduce crime -- to reduce violence
14· ·and crime, the Police Board is undertaking an
15· ·effort to engage Board members, the public, and
16· ·other participants in the police accountability
17· ·process.· CPD, COPA, Inspector General's Office.
18· ·And we actually have some of the visitors -- some
19· ·of those officers here today.· We intend to engage
20· ·in a collaborative analysis of ways to improve the
21· ·process to achieve equity, transparency, and
22· ·responsiveness to the needs of both members of the
23· ·public and the Police Department.
24· · · · · · · As a central part of this effort, the

McCorkle Litigation Services, Inc.
Chicago, Illinois· (312) 263-0052

YVer1f

 ·1· ·Board plans to use its monthly police meetings to
·2· ·present objective information about police
·3· ·accountability.· We plan to have at future public
·4· ·meetings presentations on a variety of topics, such
·5· ·as an update from the Federal Monitor on the
·6· ·consent decree activities; drafts of elements of
·7· ·implementation for the consent decree, such as
·8· ·suggested training for Board members or criteria or
·9· ·selection for Board members; the current police
10· ·accountability process; discussion of the design
11· ·and timeliness of the Chicago accountability
12· ·process compared to other similar jurisdictions;
13· ·what to do when stopped by the police; what is the
14· ·purpose of community policing and where it's been
15· ·effective; and CPD's plan for responding to active
16· ·shooter situations.
17· · · · · · ·We're going to ask the members of the
18· ·public for your ideas and what are some of the
19· ·ideas you would like to hear about.· We want to
20· ·make this meeting useful for everyone, not just a
21· ·session where one can come to complain and nothing
22· ·gets done about it.· We want to make this a useful
23· ·meeting where we can actually get the results.· The
24· ·presentations will be given by local officials and

McCorkle Litigation Services, Inc.

YVer1f

 ·1· ·by national experts on best practices.
·2· · · · · · · So as we begin the public comment
·3· ·portion of this meeting, I want to announce that
·4· ·the Board has a new policy for documenting,
·5· ·tracking, and responding to your questions and
·6· ·comments.· This policy is on our website and we are
·7· ·confident it will ensure responsiveness to
·8· ·community input received at the meetings.
·9· · · · · · · I will now call upon those members of
10· ·the public who signed up in advance to speak.· When
11· ·your name is called, please step up to the
12· ·microphone and limit your comments to two minutes.
13· · · · · · · The first speaker, I might let her go a
14· ·little bit longer than two minutes, we'll see how
15· ·the comments go.· The first speaker is Mayor Lori
16· ·Lightfoot.
17· · · · · · · · · · · (Applause.)
18· · · ·MAYOR LIGHTFOOT:· I didn't learn the lesson.
19· ·Thank you, President Foreman, members of the Board,
20· ·Chief Waller, Chief Administrator Roberts.· It's
21· ·been my great opportunity to be here with you, and
22· ·I just want to say a few words.
23· · · · · · · First, I want to tell you that my
24· ·commitment to police reform and accountability

McCorkle Litigation Services, Inc.
Chicago, Illinois· (312) 263-0052

11
YVer1f

 ·1· ·remains resolute.· I've learned a lot from sitting
·2· ·on the other side of the table, from people who
·3· ·have come to these meetings pouring out their
·4· ·hearts, asking for help, raising issues that they
·5· ·have experienced personally.· And I want to tell
·6· ·you that I've heard you and that we will make sure
·7· ·that we keep pushing forward on the necessary work
·8· ·to make sure that our Police Department is
·9· ·respectful to the community and that we continue to
10· ·do everything possible to bridge the divide.
11· · · · · · ·I think members of the Police Department
12· ·recognize that if they don't have the community on
13· ·their side, they have no legitimacy.· And without
14· ·legitimacy, they can't do their jobs effectively.
15· ·So we've got to keep doing the hard but necessary
16· ·work to make sure that the relationship between the
17· ·community who is in need of constitutional police
18· ·response are met.
19· · · · · · · Now, there are a number of things that
20· ·you're going to bring to this Board.· And there are
21· ·certainly things that I've heard over my tenure as
22· ·Police Board president that are difficult and
23· ·tough.· And we're not always going to get them
24· ·right.

12
YVer1f

 ·1· · · · · · ·But I do want to say one thing, because
·2· ·this has been a narrative that I think is important
·3· ·for me to dispel.· The members of this Board
·4· ·listen.· They hear you.· Now, they may not be able
·5· ·to respond to every single thing that comes before
·6· ·them because it's important for them not to
·7· ·prejudge any issue.· Many times you will come and
·8· ·bring issues to them that haven't actually come to
·9· ·the Police Board yet.
10· · · · · · ·But they hear you.· There's not a single
11· ·one of the people that sit on this Police Board, me
12· ·included during my tenure, when families are coming
13· ·and are distressed by a police involved shooting
14· ·and how that has shattered lives.· There is not a
15· ·single one of the Police Board members who hasn't
16· ·heard serious issues of violence and crime in
17· ·neighborhoods that's not supremely affected by the
18· ·testimony that they're being witness to.
19· · · · · · ·So I want to assure you that they are
20· ·listening, they are hearing you, and they are going
21· ·to take that into consideration in everything that
22· ·they do in discharging their responsibilities as
23· ·public servants.· This is a tough, hard job.· Many
24· ·times it's thankless.· But they are listening.

McCorkle Litigation Services, Inc.
Chicago, Illinois· (312) 263-0052

13
YVer1f

 ·1· ·Just as I'm listening.· And we will continue to
·2· ·move forward and do the hard work that is necessary
·3· ·to make sure that we are respectful to members of
·4· ·the community, but also that we do the hard work
·5· ·that's necessary to keep our community safe.
·6· · · · · · ·I also want to say to the police officers
·7· ·who are here and will be listening, we are doing
·8· ·everything we can to make sure that we are bringing
·9· ·the necessary resources to uplift and support you
10· ·as well.· Your job is difficult.· It's often
11· ·stressful.· You're engaging and seeing a tremendous
12· ·amount of trauma.
13· · · · · · ·And one thing that I'm committed to do,
14· ·and I hope some day, some day the FOP and the other
15· ·union members will join me, is to make sure that we
16· ·provide support and wellness in a robust way to
17· ·members of our Police Department.· It's distressing
18· ·to me that we've had seven officer suicides in the
19· ·last 12 months.· And, unfortunately, way too much
20· ·silence in ways that we should be public in talking
21· ·about the things that are -- that you all are
22· ·experiencing on a daily basis.· We will change that
23· ·and we will bring resources.
24· · · · · · ·Mr. Blakemore is giving me the hook, so

McCorkle Litigation Services, Inc.

YVer1f

 ·1· ·let me wind up.· I saw that.· I saw that.· Well,
·2· ·I'll play by the same rules.
·3· · · · · · ·Many of you in this audience I know come
·4· ·month after month diligently, and I applaud you for
·5· ·that.· The work is important, the activism is
·6· ·critically important.· We have to come together as
·7· ·a community.· Again, we're not going to agree on
·8· ·every issue, but it's really important for us to
·9· ·recognize that people in this room who come here
10· ·and talk about issues that are important to them
11· ·are our neighbors, they come in good faith, and
12· ·we've got to make sure we give them respect and the
13· ·opportunity to be heard.
14· · · · · · · So I appreciate you indulging me in this
15· ·moment.· Thank you again, President Foreman and
16· ·members of the Board, for allowing me this moment.
17· ·And I appreciate the work that you're doing to make
18· ·these meetings more interactive and more impactful
19· ·for everybody concerned.· So thank you very much.

10· ·burned, and even mutilated.· We need the community
11· ·to be alerted and the nation alerted as well.
12· · · · · · ·We need a task force immediately.· We

11· ·We did a teach in on the consent decree yesterday
12· ·and I did some looking into the 1919 race riots,
13· ·and I found that there was one police officer that
14· ·was killed and he was African-American and his name
15· ·was John W. Simpson.· So I think if anybody's name
16· ·should be on that police academy, it should be John
17· ·W. Simpson.
18· · · · · · · Okay.· Robert Rialmo.· I've already told
19· ·you forensic evidence proves that his testimony is
20· ·incorrect.· I have told that you he's committed
21· ·perjury on the stands.· Just look at his deposition
22· ·compared to his trial record.· I told you about his
23· ·comments unbecoming.· And I told you that we cannot

·3· · · · · · · But let me talk about the pièce de
·4· ·résistance, right?· Asking for $10 million because
·5· ·you killed two African Americans and blaming it on
·6· ·your CPD training.· This man was a military police
·7· ·officer.· Military.· Now, I'm sure the military
·8· ·teaches their military police not to shoot
·9· ·innocents.· But to ask for $10 million for two
10· ·people is just ridiculous.· He has to go.
11· · · · · · ·And so I'm asking you, I know the record
12· ·said I was telling you, but I'm asking you, please
13· ·let this man go off of this police force.
14· · · · · · · In reference to the Mayor.· Mayor, I'm
15· ·happy to see that you're here.· I wanted to say to
16· ·you Women's All Points Bulletin is part of the
17· ·(inaudible) for the consent decree, and we are not
18· ·pleased with the community meetings that CPD had.
19· ·But we appreciate anything that the Police Board
20· ·can do to improve these meetings.· We're not happy
21· ·with the decision COPA made about the Joshua Beal
22· ·murder.· And we'll be -- we'll be talking again.

 ·1· · · ·BISHOP GREER:· Good afternoon, Board.
·2· · · · · · ·So once again, I come before you, Bishop
·3· ·Greg over at Freedom First International, to talk
·4· ·about the 50-plus murdered women.· My plea, as
·5· ·we've gone through City Council, as we've come back
·6· ·here again, is the same as my cohort, Staci Love
·7· ·from Chicago Girls Missing.· We have yet to do a
·8· ·public service announcement about young ladies who
·9· ·have been murdered.· Yes, we don't want to say it's
10· ·a serial killer, but it is not unreasonable for us
11· ·to ask that we keep the public informed.· And I can
12· ·guarantee that that has not happened.· And if it
13· ·has, I challenge one person on this Board to tell
14· ·me that it has.
15· · · · · · · I've taken this case around the country,
16· ·BET, The Associated Press, The Globe.· Chicago is
17· ·not looking good.· Chicago policing is looking very
18· ·bad.· And I would love to bring a positive report
19· ·that we've resolved one of these cases.· But I just
20· ·simply can't.
21· · · · · · ·Yes, we don't want to say that it's a
22· ·serial killer that exists.· But what have we done
23· ·to protect the public to stop the body count?
24· ·We've said that -- and this is the scariest part of

McCorkle Litigation Services, Inc.
Chicago, Illinois· (312) 263-0052

YVer1f

 ·1· ·the whole scenario -- we've said that 55 -- excuse
·2· ·me, while 55 women or 55-plus women have been
·3· ·murdered, we said that those were separate cases.
·4· ·And I don't know what's scarier, saying that it's
·5· ·one serial killer, a group of serial killers, we've
·6· ·got 55 murderers running around the City of Chicago
·7· ·that were never caught.· With a 14 percent
·8· ·clearance rate of Chicago Police, we are in for a
·9· ·challenge the first day of summer.· I am asking
10· ·that we do public service announcements.
11· · · · · · · South side, far south side, west side,
12· ·got to do something.· Because if not, we're in for
13· ·a blood bath.· I'd appreciate it if we can follow
14· ·up.· My office is open, I'm on Delano Court.

I

15· ·would a love a line to yourself, Officer Waller,
16· ·and Captain Johnson -- excuse me, Commander
17· ·Johnson, and also to City Hall.· We've got to do
18· ·something.
19· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· Thank you.
20· · · ·BISHOP GREER:· We are losing lives.· Please.
21· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· Thank you.
22· · · · · · ·Next speaker, Octavia Mitchell.
23· · · ·MS. MITCHELL:· Hi.· You all know my name is
24· ·Octavia Mitchell.· I'm here to discuss my deceased

 ·1· ·son, Izael Jackson, that was shot in the back by
·2· ·CPD three times.
·3· · · · · · ·We know that I had fought for his DNA to
·4· ·be tested.· COPA did receive the DNA.· My thing now
·5· ·is how is that the investigating officer that took
·6· ·this DNA was able to swear under oath in a federal
·7· ·court that the Illinois State Police had this DNA.
·8· ·I'm asking for the chain of command of who had his
·9· ·DNA, where did it stop, and why all of the sudden
10· ·the CPD is stating they just found it.
11· · · · · · ·I can get on the stand the lawyers, also
12· ·the investigating officer on the stand, under oath,
13· ·lying in court, saying that Illinois State Police
14· ·had his DNA.· All the time, for nine years they
15· ·knew that they never submitted this DNA to the
16· ·Illinois State Police.· So they need to be punished
17· ·for lying.· They went all of these lies and they
18· ·went all of this lies, it's not inside and got COPA
19· ·involved.· They even lied to COPA and told COPA
20· ·that Illinois State Police had the DNA until COPA
21· ·went to the Illinois State Police, just as I did,
22· ·and the Illinois State Police told them that the
23· ·CPD never submitted the DNA to them.
24· · · · · · ·So I'm asking that you all to give me

 ·1· ·paperwork who collected it, where it started, and
·2· ·where it ended.· And how could you close my son's
·3· ·case without all the pieces to the puzzle if you
·4· ·didn't have all of this evidence.
·5· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· This is a complex question.
·6· ·So, Chief, I'm going to send this your way.
·7· · · ·CHIEF WALLER:· Ma'am, I'll speak to you off
·8· ·line.
·9· · · ·MS. MITCHELL:· No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
10· ·You're not off lining me again.· I've been here for
11· ·six months, every third Thursday.· You're not off
12· ·lining me again.· I want to know how do I get this
13· ·paperwork and which way do I get this paperwork.
14· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· I'm sorry, I have an
15· ·update.· So I just spoke with Chief Administrator
16· ·Roberts, and so this is something that COPA is
17· ·looking into.
18· · · ·MS. MITCHELL:· I know.· I understand what
19· ·you're saying.· COPA, I spoke with COPA.· COPA has
20· ·the DNA.· CPD finally submitted the DNA to COPA
21· ·after all of this fighting.
22· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· I'm not talking about the
23· ·DNA.· I'm talking about the question that you
24· ·asked.· So COPA is looking into getting these

McCorkle Litigation Services, Inc.
Chicago, Illinois· (312) 263-0052

22
YVer1f

 ·1· ·answers for you.
·2· · · ·MS. MITCHELL:· So COPA is looking at the DNA,
·3· ·who collected it.· We know now after nine years
·4· ·they lied for five years stating that the Illinois
·5· ·State Police had this DNA and they don't know why
·6· ·it wasn't tested.
·7· · · · · · ·I want to know who collected it and when
·8· ·did it stop.· Because they had to know that the
·9· ·Illinois State Police didn't have it when they got
10· ·on that stand and lied.· I want to know where did
11· ·it stop, who supposed to submit it to the Illinois
12· ·State Police and didn't do it.· I need all of that
13· ·paperwork.
14· · · ·MS. ROBERTS:· With respect to one of the
15· ·things -- that whole process is part of what we
16· ·will be looking into to.
17· · · ·MS. MITCHELL:· Okay.· But can I have it?
18· · · ·MS. ROBERTS:· I don't know if you can have that
19· ·right now.· I don't know if that's public
20· ·information.· I have to check with our general
21· ·counsel.
22· · · ·MS. MITCHELL:· But they told me I could have
23· ·the DNA and the DNA belongs to me.· The DNA is
24· ·mine.· I'm the Estate of whatever Izael Jackson

McCorkle Litigation Services, Inc.
Chicago, Illinois· (312) 263-0052

23
YVer1f

 ·1· ·left behind and they told me I couldn't have that.
·2· ·I've been fighting for nine years to get that.
·3· ·Just to get my son's DNA, that they knew they
·4· ·should have gave me in the first place.· And even
·5· ·with my personal attorney, when she put in a FOIA
·6· ·of information for everything, they should have
·7· ·submitted that also.
·8· · · · · · ·So I have all the transcripts.· I have
·9· ·where the lawyers lied, I have where the
10· ·investigating officer lied on the stand under oath.
11· ·They need to be terminated also.· Because all these
12· ·polices are doing, the CPD, the City is lying and
13· ·covering up.
14· · · ·MS. ROBERTS:· We will have an answer about
15· ·whether or not we can turn that information over to
16· ·you.· Give us a couple of days.· I'll have my
17· ·general counsel here, he will speak with you.
18· · · ·MS. MITCHELL:· Okay.· Can somebody tell me will
19· ·Mr. John (inaudible), the investigating officer, be
20· ·investigated for lying under oath?
21· · · ·MS. ROBERTS:· Those are all of the things that
22· ·we will be taking a look at, Ms. Mitchell.· And
23· ·actually, Mr. Eaddy is right there and he can
24· ·actually talk to you in a little more detail.

 ·1· ·called you two days prior to the (inaudible) that
·2· ·took place on the west side on the 9th.· And had
·3· ·you returned that call, perhaps that life would
·4· ·have been saved and that homicide would have been
·5· ·prevented prior to you coming out here with the
·6· ·Mayor.
·7· · · · · · ·Yesterday was very memorable.· June 19th.
·8· ·Thank you, Madam Mayor.· With everything going on,
·9· ·with Carrie Austin in the media, the Memorial Day
10· ·weekend kind of tells us, those of us who are in
11· ·the street, just how the summer is going to be.
12· ·And every summer is a sizzling summer season.· And
13· ·you all been in these jobs long enough to have some
14· ·serious prevention mechanisms in place.
15· · · · · · ·Because we're dealing with an experience
16· ·in this cultural is going to have to be addressed
17· ·from a cultural perspective.· And this is a flood
18· ·of black blood that just is flashing in and it's
19· ·going through the urban streets of African-American
20· ·communities into my village without a dollar or
21· ·dime for resources.· We pay the cost out here with
22· ·all the billions of dollars that you go through.
23· · · · · · ·I was appalled that, being present, me
24· ·and Gregg, at the hearing that Barb (inaudible)

·2· ·women and the cover up, that the Commander sat on
·3· ·the stage and didn't did not and was not aware that
·4· ·there are emergency alert whistles in the precinct
·5· ·of Chicago police stations.· And if I can spend the
·6· ·money to make it happen, it seems like you can make
·7· ·the sisters aware that they're there.
·8· · · · · · ·But, you see, I know it's difficult for
·9· ·you all to inform the public that there is police
10· ·in the street and portray this false sense of
11· ·security.· At the same time you can't do it.
12· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· Thank you, Queen Sister.
13· · · ·MS. SISTER:· You know, just like you can't fake
14· ·it and keep it real at the same time.
15· · · · · · ·I have one more issue, Mr. President.
16· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· Quickly.
17· · · ·MS. SISTER:· And that is the fact that we have
18· ·concluded, due to me receiving three tickets on a
19· ·car I have had less than two months, that it
20· ·appears that Chicago Police have collaborated and
21· ·conspired with Chicago and the Secretary of State.
22· ·Because I'm getting tickets on a car for not having
23· ·a window sticker, and when I get to the Currency
24· ·Exchange I can't purchase the window sticker

·2· · · ·MR. MORE:· It is June 20 of 2019, Robert
·3· ·J. More, speaking on behalf of the institute of
·4· ·St. Michael the Archangel.· And just to show that
·5· ·there is absolutely no hypocrisy, nothing remotely
·6· ·resembling hypocrisy, it's a blind (inaudible) to
·7· ·avoid all appearances of evil.
·8· · · · · · ·And so I acknowledge, Mr. Foreman, last
·9· ·week that I was very impressed with your
10· ·performance in terms of protecting the
11· ·constitutional integrity (inaudible) you took.
12· · · · · · ·But that's in the larger context that I'm
13· ·about the projects willful charge of the City of
14· ·Chicago, Cook County, Illinois, the State of
15· ·Illinois, and not only the United States of
16· ·America.· It's just we don't -- I never disparage
17· ·nor do I compliment, I simply acknowledge what's
18· ·useful and helpful to advancing the cause of the
19· ·Catholic cause, which is the salvation of soul, in
20· ·which I am enlisted as a lowest, lowest, lowest
21· ·level non-officer.
22· · · · · · ·But at any rate, what is the basis of the

·3· · · ·MR. MORE:· Okay.· Got you.
·4· · · · · · ·Next question, Mayor Lightfoot, are you
·5· ·going to come to every meeting?· If you are going
·6· ·to start coming to every meeting, I don't to have
·7· ·to deal with this game with the Superintendent
·8· ·anymore.· Can you start coming to every meeting?
·9· ·Or if I can get a stipulation as to your state of
10· ·mind, that would be immensely beneficial to
11· ·everyone in this room.· Because if Rudy Juliani's
12· ·state of mind had been under control of the
13· ·citizens of New York in 2001, I guarantee that we
14· ·wouldn't have a September 11.
15· · · · · · ·But if you can come or if I can get an
16· ·mail address, because I got a laundry list of
17· ·issues.· If you really want to correct the system,
18· ·then there's things you can do independent of the
19· ·federal grand jury.· You can discontinue
20· ·withholding any federal income tax immediately.
21· ·You can only accept payment of debts in a currency
22· ·that is constitutional.· There's all types of
23· ·things you can do as a mayor to actually fix the
24· ·problem.· So I'm hoping that you'll be accessible,
