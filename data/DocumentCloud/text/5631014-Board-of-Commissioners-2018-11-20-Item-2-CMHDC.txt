Item No. 2

AUTHORIZATION TO APPROVE EXTENSION OF PARTICIPATION AGREEMENT
ALLOWING CHICAGO METROPOLITAN HOUSING DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION’S
PARTICIPATION FOR 2019 AS A PARTICIPATING EMPLOYER IN THE CHICAGO
HOUSING AUTHORITY EMPLOYEES’ RETIREMENT PLAN AND TRUST
Presenter:

Michael J. Gurgone, Chief Investment Officer & Treasurer

Recommendation
It is recommended that the Board of Commissioners approve the attached Resolution authorizing
the Chicago Metropolitan Housing Development Corporation (“CMHDC”) to participate for the
calendar year 2019 in the Chicago Housing Authority Employees’ Retirement Plan (“Retirement
Plan”) upon execution of Participation Agreement incorporated in the Resolution.
Funding
No CHA funding is applicable to this request.
General Background
The CHA Board of Commissioners has adopted an Amended and Restated Retirement Plan
effective September 21, 2017 that clarifies the terms of participation with respect to persons to
whom the CHA and the Board of Trustees may extend participation by requiring an executed
Participation Agreement. The Board of Commissioners previously approved such participation
to certain CMHDC employees under the conditions specified in the Participation Agreement
which expires December 31, 2018.
On September 28th, 2018 the CHA Board of Trustees for the CHA Employees Retirement Plan and
Trust approved a resolution for extension of this participation for the period January 1 2019 thru
December 31, 2019. This extension would be under similar terms and conditions with respect to
payroll contributions as updated along with a flat fee surcharge for actuarial services. This
agreement will cover the 5 remaining employees covered by CMHDC.
Based on the above and the recommendation of the CHA’s management, it is in the best interest
of the CHA to allow participation of CMHDC employees in the Retirement Plan under the
conditions specified in the Participation Agreement.
Respectfully Submitted:
