QENERAL BACKGROUND

The purpose of the Request for Proposal No. 11-00815 (the was to solicit vendors to
coordinate subsidized employment opportunities for CHA adults at SFSP and GDP sites.

ii i .
r?v ir?I? at

Summg EM Service mm: The SF SP provides a nutritious breakfast and lunch to children
between the ages of 3 to 18. In 2008, CHA began utilizing Summer Food sites located near
CHA developments as a subsidized employment opportunity for CHA adults and incorporated
both training and certi?cation components. This contract creates jobs for CHA residents that
would otherwise be ?lled with temporary city workers through the Chicago Department of
Family and Support Services There are currently 43 SF SP sites located in CHA
developments and scattered sites that serve as part of the City of Chicago?s program through the
Illinois State Board of Education. SFSP sites are Open Monday to Friday for a period of 11
weeks during out of school time in the summer months. In 201 1, the 43 Summer Food locations
near CI-IA developments served more than 80,000 meals to CHA children.

In 2012 and 2013, approximately 90 CHA adult residents will be placed in subsidized
employment each year at SF SP sites (approximately 180 CHA residents will be placed at SF SP
sites during the 2-year contract term). These participants will be hired and trained by EDSI to
work 6 hours per day, 5 days per week, for a total of 30 hours per week. Participants will receive
minimum wage, currently $8.25 per hour. The total maximum wages paid, inclusive of required
insurance FICA, workers compensation), for SF SP is budgeted at $568,770.00.

Golden Ding FEM (GDP): The City of Chicago?s GDP provides nutritious full-course meals
for seniors age 60 and older (and their spouse of any age) who may have limited mobility and

lack the incentive to prepare meals and eat alone. The GDP, operated through the DFSS,
provides healthy lunches to seniors 5 days per week, Monday through Friday. There are
currently 22 Golden Diner sites in designated CHA senior buildings, and CHA has historically
paid for the city workers at these sites. In 2010, CHA and DF SS incorporated a subsidized work
component for CHA residents at GDP sites to create more employment and training
opportunities for residents. In 2011, approximately 160,000 meals were served to CHA seniors
through the GDP.

In 2012 and 2013, 2 CHA adult residents will be placed in subsidized employment at each GDP
site for 6 hours per day, 5 days per week, for a total of 30 hours per week. Participants will
receive the current minimum wage rate for the 10-12 month program period. During the 2-year
contract term, approximately 110 CHA residents will be placed at GDP sites. The total maximum
wages paid to CHA participants in the GDP, inclusive of FICA and worker?s compensation, is
budgeted at $876,327.00.

Following a competitive procurement process, CI-IA is recommending EDSI to coordinate the
requested services for the SF SP and GDP sites. For more than 17 years, EDSI has provided
employment, training and workforce development services in the city of Chicago. EDSI
currently operates Chicago ServiceWorks, the City?s Workforce Center for Businesses in the
Hospitality/Service sector. Additionally, EDSI has collaborated with CHA FamilyWorks
providers to provide staff with training and education on hotel, restaurant, retail, customer
service jobs and related employment services, and has received contracts to provide employment
services through the Partnership for New Communities? Opportunity Chicago.

EDSI will work with residents to improve job skills, secure training and employment within the
hOSpitality sector through these work experience programs. EDSI will provide participant
recruitment, training, coaching and follow-up services including unsubsidized employment
placement. EDSI will sub-contract with Hill Food Service Consulting to provide participants

with training needed to obtain the Food Service Certi?cations and Licensure. Educational
Advantage will provide support for SFSP and GDP by monitoring workers at each program site,
as well as provide permanent job placement assistance and related services.

PREUREMENT HISTORY

The CHA released and advertised an RFP on September 29, 2011 to solicit consultants and/or
?rms to coordinate subsidized employment opportunities for CHA adults at SF SP and GDP sites.
The RFP was advertised in the Chicago Sun-Times, the Chicago Defender, Extra, the CHA
website, and BuySpeed (e-procurement system). The CHA also directly solicited 292 ?rms,
including 75 ?rms. A pre-proposal meeting was held on October 4, 2011, with
vendors representing eight (8) ?rms in attendance. The CHA received three (3) proposals on
November 3, 2011. An evaluation committee consisting of ?ve (5) members evaluated the
proposals, which included a representative ?'om the Central Advisory Council.

After the Evaluation Committee completed its analysis of the proposals, a competitive range was
set and approved by the Contracting Of?cer. Three (3) ?rms were found to be within the
competitive range, and were scheduled for oral presentations the week of November 21, 2011.
During these meetings, negotiations were held, and best and ?nal offers submitted by each ?rm.
Based upon the evaluations of the written proposals, oral presentations and best and ?nal offers,
it was determined that EDSI would provide the best overall service and value to CHA. The
EDSI average cost per participant of training and administering the work experience programs,
not including wages is $2,185.00 per year per participant. The average cost of other respondents
was $4,266.00 and $8,357.00 per year per participant.

Based upon the foregoing, it is in the best interest of the CHA to authorize the Chief Executive
Of?cer, or his designee, to enter into a contract with Educational Data Systems, Inc. for a 2 year
base term in an amount not-to-exceed $2,712,398.00, and with 2 one-year options, to provide
training and subsidized work experiences for CI-IA residents at SFSP and GDP sites.
