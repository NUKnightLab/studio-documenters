$240,000.00 for the purchase of machinery and manufacturing equipment to in-source additional
production and expand machining capabilities for a project located at 24240 Rockwell Road, Euclid.
Funding Source: Western Reserve Fund
Bob Flauto, Department of Development, presented. Trevor McAleer asked if the City of Euclid has
committed any funds to this project and if there was any delay getting this item to the Board of Control
for consideration once the Cuyahoga County Community Improvement Corporation approved the
recommendation. Nan Baker asked if the County will be invoicing monthly and asked for clarification on
the funding source. Dennis Kennedy asked if there is another loan between the County and this company.
Dennis Kennedy motioned to approve the item; Dale Miller seconded. Item BC2019-86 was unanimously
approved.

 BC2019-87
Department of Workforce Development, in partnership with City of Cleveland/Cuyahoga County
Workforce Development Board, submitting an amendment to Contract No. CE1600241 with Towards
Employment, Inc. for job seeker services for applicants with felony backgrounds for the period 7/1/2016
– 6/30/2019 for additional funds in the amount not-to-exceed $70,000.00.
Funding Source: Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act Federal Funds
Frank Brickner, Department of Workforce Development, presented. There were no questions. Dennis
Kennedy motioned to approve the item; Dale Miller seconded. Item BC2019-87 was unanimously
approved.
BC2019-88
Fiscal Office/Office of the Treasurer, submitting an amendment to Contract No. CE1700022 with Meeder
Public Funds, Inc. for Investment Advisor services for the period 1/1/2017 – 12/31/2018 to extend the
time period to 12/31/2020, to expand the scope of services by authorizing the Advisor to execute
investment transactions on a discretionary basis and, adding trust fund accounts to the accounts advised
by the Advisor, effective 1/1/2019 and for additional funds in the amount not-to-exceed $270,000.00.
Funding Source: General Fund
Chris Murray, Office of the Treasurer, presented. Nan Baker asked for the reason for late submission and
if it was anticipated that this would be submitted late; asked for clarification on the start of the next
renewal period. Dale Miller asked if any additional renewal periods are available after this amendment
and how long those are; asked if this amendment to expand the scope of services is to complete duties
resulting from a position vacancy in the Office of the Treasurer and asked for clarification on the annual
amount of contract; asked what type of investment decisions will this vendor make on behalf of the
County to justify the cost of the contracted amount, as the County is not permitted to invest in stocks and
speculative investments, but rather relatively short-term debt instruments of modest variations in their
value and would it produce enough benefit as opposed to managing investments in-house.
Trevor McAleer asked if there are any projections on how much the County will benefit by directing $200
million into trust accounts and asked if those figures could be provided.
Dennis Kennedy asked if this had been discussed at the last Investment Committee meeting after the
position in the Treasurer’s Office had become vacant and stated that it was determined that this is the
best route to manage investments. Mr. Kennedy also asked Mr. Murray to elaborate on the success on
earnings and what benefits are being gained by contracting for advisory services; stated that discussions
were held at the Investment Committee meeting and that it is difficult to find an investment manager for
such a large portfolio at the pay being offered, which creates issues on investment management when an
in-house manager is absent as opposed to a contracted vendor.
Dale Miller also asked what the $200 million in trust funds consist of and if these are cash assets that are
being invested until the money is ready to be used. Dennis Kennedy motioned to approve the item; Trevor
McAleer seconded. Item BC2019-88 was unanimously approved.

 BC2019-89
Fiscal Office/Office of the Treasurer, submitting an amendment to Contract No. CE1400319 with F&E
Check Protector Company dba F&E Payment Pros for licensing, support, training and maintenance services
on the Digital Remittance Processing System for the period 10/1/2014 – 9/30/2019, and for additional
funds in the amount not-to-exceed $1,565.00.
Funding Source: General Fund
Charnese Wilson, Office of the Treasurer, presented. There were no questions. Dennis Kennedy motioned
to approve the item; Dale Miller seconded. Item BC2019-89 was unanimously approved.
BC2019-90
Fiscal Office/Board of Revision, submitting an amendment to Contract No. CE1700359 with Sadler NeCamp Financial Services, Inc. dba Proware for modification, maintenance and support services on the Civil
Criminal Justice Information System (CCJIS) electronic filing system for the period 1/19/2018 – 12/31/2018
to extend the time period to 12/31/2020 and for additional funds in the amount not-to-exceed $4,300.00.
Funding Source: Real Estate Assessment Fund

unanimously approved.

Ohio HR Conference in the amount not to exceed $2,420.00 for sponsorship and exhibitor booth space
in connection with the Northern Ohio Human Resource Conference for the period 3/22/2019.
b) Recommending an award on RQ44660 to Northern Ohio HR Conference in the amount not to exceed
$2,420.00 for sponsorship and exhibitor booth space in connection with the Northern Ohio Human
Resource Conference for the period 3/22/2019.

David Feinerman, Department of Development, presented. Trevor McAleer asked why this item is being
submitted as Department of Health and Human Services, on behalf of the Department of Development.
Dennis Kennedy motioned to approve the item; Dale Miller seconded. Item BC2019-92 was unanimously
approved.

 BC2019-93
Department of Health and Human Services/Office of Reentry,
a) Submitting an RFP exemption on RQ41710, which will result in an award recommendation to The
Securus/Richard A. Smith Foundation in the amount not to exceed $46,000.00 for development of an online interactive “Going Home to Stay” re-entry resource and information guide for the period 1/15/2019
- 12 /31/2020.
b) Recommending an award on RQ41710 and enter into a contract with The Securus/Richard A. Smith
Foundation in the amount not to exceed $46,000.00 for development of an on-line interactive “Going
Home to Stay” re-entry resource and information guide for the period 1/15/2019 - 12 /31/2020.
Funding Source: Health and Human Services Levy
Fred Bolotin, Office of Reentry, presented. Dale Miller asked if paper copies of the guide will be made
available for distribution, as needed, and asked if printing costs will come out of this contract or be a
separate expense; asked if the primary users of the guide will be the re-entry population or community
agencies serving that population. Trevor McAleer asked for clarification as to whether a Request for
Proposals (RFP) process was conducted, as the backup indicates this is the only vendor that applied to
provide this service. In response to Mr. Bolotin’s statement that an informal RFP was conducted, Lenora
Lockett stated that this purchase does not meet the criteria for an informal Request for Proposals, as the
amount exceeds $25,000.00. Mr. McAleer also said that he does not believe this is the only vendor who
can create this interactive guide; asked if the department consulted with the Department of Information
Technology (DOIT) to see if they can recommend other vendors who can provide this service and asked if
DOIT concurred with the department that no other vendor can provide this guide; expressed his concern
about approving an RFP exemption as he believes there are other qualified vendors that can provide this
guide.
Nan Baker asked for clarification that the department is sublicensing this software from the vendor and
asked what agency holds the original license. Dale Miller asked if the County is committed to these licenses
on an on-going basis after two years or can a formal RFP be conducted at that time to see what other
options are available. Mr. Miller indicated his willingness to vote on this item if there is a commitment to
monitor this service in anticipation of conducting a formal process before the contract expires. Ms. Baker
also asked for clarification as to whether this contract is only for one year and asked if there is a renewal
option for an additional year; asked if the contract includes a termination clause should the County decide
to not continue with services. Mr. Miller referenced Ms. Baker’s comment regarding contract termination
after one year and asked that Mr. Bolotin review this contract and confirm with Board members that early
termination is an option. Dennis Kennedy motioned to approve the item; Dale Miller seconded. Item
BC2019-92 was unanimously approved.
Dennis Kennedy referred to previously approved Item No. BC2019-65 dated 1/22/2019 and reminded Mr.
Bolotin of the question Mr. Kennedy raised at that meeting of whether the contract with Design Impact,
Inc. includes travel expense reimbursement to the vendor. Mr. Bolotin had indicated at that time that no
travel expenses were included in this contract and the vendor would cover those costs. Mr. Kennedy said
that this contract has since been reviewed and did include reimbursement for travel expenses, as shown
in Exhibit II of the contract and asked Mr. Bolotin for an explanation. Mr. Kennedy stressed the importance
that the departments properly represent their requests and provide accurate information to the Board
prior to voting on their items.

 The following item was held at the request of the Law Department.
BC2019-94
Department of Law,
a) Submitting an RFP exemption on RQ43955, which will result in an award recommendation to Atticus
Administration, LLC in the amount not-to-exceed $9,144.00 for third party class action administration
services for the period 9/5/2018 – 9/4/2019.
b) Recommending an award on RQ43955 and enter into a contract with Atticus Administration, LLC in the

an award recommendation to Promega and Life Technologies in the amount not to exceed $276,257.00
to procure genetic testing kits and other consumable supplies for the period 1/1/2019 – 12/31/2020.

Hugh Shannon, Office of the Medical Examiner, presented. There were no questions. Dennis Kennedy
motioned to approve the item; Trevor McAleer seconded. Item BC2019-95 was unanimously approved.
D. – Consent Agenda
Nan Baker referred to Item No. BC2019-105, Proposed Purchases, Requisition No. SH-19-44350 and asked
why the cost of this purchase for gloves was so high. There was no representative from the Sheriff’s
Department to respond to Ms. Baker’s question. Andria Richardson, Clerk of the Board of Control said that
she will research this matter and respond to board members.
Dennis Kennedy referred to Item No. BC2019-97 and recommended that the County explore the
possibility of using another vendor for equipment disposal as RET3 was somewhat involved in a
Department of Corrections investigation by the State, as well as an additional case, where hard drives
were not being properly cleaned and wants to ensure there is no possibility that County data is
compromised. Trevor McAleer asked Dennis Sullivan, Department of Information Technology, if the
County performs a complete wipe of hard drives before releasing them to RET3. Mr. Kennedy said that
further discussions to consider other alternatives will be held on this issue. There were no further
questions on the consent agenda items. Dennis Kennedy motioned to approve items BC2019-96 through
-105; Trevor McAleer seconded, the consent items were unanimously approved.
