Report on CountyCare Health Plan (continued)
During the discussion of the care management metrics, Board Chairman Hammock requested that the
performance be more accurately reflected on the slide, as opposed to just reflecting the trend; for example, if
the goal is 70% and the current performance is at 39.2%, the trend is positive (green arrow pointing up) in
comparison to the previous month, but the overall performance is still well below the goal. Additionally,
with regard to quality metrics on slide 6, he requested that, in addition to trend, that absolute to goal data be
included.
During the discussion of the quality metrics, Dr. John Jay Shannon, Chief Executive Officer, stated that there
have been some discussions in the past around what is the right venue for these metrics. Should metrics on
health plan performance as it relates to achieving quality be presented in this committee, or should they be
presented in the Quality and Patient Safety Committee? This can be further discussed, however, he is getting
a better understanding that there is probably a preferred time of the year to look at it and get an accurate
sense of how well the plan is doing – that is probably an annual event.
Chairman Junge urged the Directors to make suggestions on what metrics they would like to see this year, in
addition to those being presented. Director Richardson-Lowry indicated that she is interested in seeing data
on tracking referrals from partners.
