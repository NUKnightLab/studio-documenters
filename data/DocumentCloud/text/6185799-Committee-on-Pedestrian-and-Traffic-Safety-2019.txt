East 75th Street is a minor collector roadway with significantly higher traffic volumes
than South Ellis Avenue, a local roadway. Stop signs on streets with higher volumes
such as East 75th Street tend to increase rear-end crashes, increase congestion, and
create a false sense of security for pedestrians that every vehicle will stop. Therefore,
CDOT does not recommend an All-Way Stop at this intersection (19-01175313)

ITEM WARD

TRAFFIC WARNING SIGNS AND/OR SIGNALS CONT'D:

113

South Oak Park Avenue and West 61st Street are both local roadways forming a Tintersection with 61st Street terminating at Oak Park Avenue. Based on the location of
an existing driveway on the west side of Oak Park Avenue at 61st Street, a stop sign
for southbound traffic would need to be placed approximately 50 feet from the cross
street. Stop signs placed a large distance from the cross street can have sight line
issues, complicate determining who has the right-of-way, and overall be confusing to
drivers. Therefore, CDOT does not recommend an All-Way Stop Sign at this
intersection - (1 9-01 06931 7) lOr2019-1 181

221

South Lowe Avenue and West 87th Street; Stop Sign, Stopping AllApproaches. Not
Recommended. West 87th Street is a principal arterial with significantly higher traffic
volumes than S. Lowe Avenue, a local roadway. Stop signs on streets with higher
volumes such as W. BTth Street tend to increase rear-end crashes, increase
congestion, and create a false sense of security for pedestrians that every vehicle will
stop. Therefore, CDOT does not recommend an all-way stop at this intersection.
