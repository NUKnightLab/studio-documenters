PROPOSED RESOLUTION
RECOGNIZING THE CHICAGO ZOOLOGICAL SOCIETY, LINCOLN PARK ZOO, AND
SHEDD AQUARIUM FOR THEIR EFFORTS TO RAISE AWARENESS OF THE PLIGHT OF
AFRICAN ELEPHANTS
WHEREAS, Increasing demand for ivory is fueling the brutal slaughter of African elephants; and
WHEREAS, Illegal trade in elephant ivory is the most significant threat to Africa’s elephant populations
and is driving the mass slaughter of elephants, especially across Central and Eastern Africa; and
WHEREAS, Approximately 35,000 wild African elephants were poached in 2012 because of the demand
for their tusks, which contain ivory; and
WHEREAS, The wild African elephant population has declined from 1.2 million in 1980 to just 420,000
in 2012, and Central Africa’s forest elephant populations have declined by 75% in the last decade due to
illegal poaching for ivory; and
WHEREAS, Elephant ivory currently sells for about $3,000 per kilogram, representing a value of
$20,000 per elephant; and
WHEREAS, With an estimated value between $10 billion and $20 billion per year, the illegal wildlife
trade is a major trans-national crime run by professional criminal networks and is strongly linked to other
trans-national organized criminal activities such as narcotics, weapons, and human-trafficking; and
WHEREAS, There is significant evidence that illegal trade in high-value wildlife parts, including
elephant ivory, is being used as a source for financing criminal organizations and armed groups that pose
a threat to U.S. economic and security interests in Africa and elsewhere, including the Lord’s Resistance
Army, al-Shabaab, al-Qaeda, Sudanese militias, and other groups with potential terrorist ties; and
WHEREAS, The State Department of the United States has provided that criminal organizations’
involvement in wildlife trafficking “perpetuates corruption, threatens the rule of law and border security
in fragile regions, and destabilizes communities that depend on wildlife for biodiversity and eco-tourism”;
and
WHEREAS, In 1989, the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) banned
the international commercial trade in ivory; and
WHEREAS, In the United States, the import, export, interstate trade, and commercial sale of ivory
removed from the wild after the CITES ban (and in some cases even earlier) is illegal, with a few
exceptions; and
Page 6 of 67

 FPD Board of Commissioners

BOARD AGENDA

July 22, 2014

WHEREAS, In many cases, documented ivory predating the 1989 ban (called “pre-convention” ivory)
can be traded. However, laws vary by state and by species; and
WHEREAS, A major challenge to effective enforcement is that parallel legal ivory markets serve as a
cover for illegal ivory from recently killed elephants as it is extremely difficult to distinguish between
legal ivory, including antiques and illegal ivory, once it is within our borders, therefore parallel legal
ivory markets are contributing to the elephant poaching across Africa; and
WHEREAS, With limited enforcement, minimum penalties in addition to elaborate forgery schemes,
traffickers are able to get illegal ivory into the U.S. market; and
WHEREAS, As long as demand for ivory remains high and enforcement effort is low, the legal trade will
continue to serve as a front and criminal syndicates will continue to drive elephant poaching across
Africa, which will lead to the extinction of wild elephants in Africa; and
WHEREAS, The United States is the world’s second largest importer and market after China for ivory
sales, and because current laws allow for the legal trade in certain ivory products, and include broad
loopholes and exemptions, there is significant illegal trade in ivory in the United States; and
WHEREAS, As the United States reaches out to China, the world’s largest ivory consumer nation, and
other countries to crack down on the illegal ivory trade it is important for the United States and for the
State of Illinois to stop the trade within our own borders and lead by example; and
WHEREAS, States have an opportunity to lead the way during this critical time for Africa’s elephants by
establishing moratoria on the sale of all elephant ivory and ivory products; and
WHEREAS, States can eliminate the significant enforcement challenge posed by the legal ivory trade,
raise consumer awareness, reduce poaching pressures on elephants, and set a critical example for other
state and federal lawmakers as well as other countries; and
WHEREAS, the Chicago Zoological Society, which manages the Brookfield Zoo, the Lincoln Park Zoo
and Shedd Aquarium are three Illinois-based organizations accredited by the Association of Zoos and
Aquariums that operate significant wildlife conservation programs locally and around the world; and
WHEREAS, the Chicago Zoological Society, Lincoln Park Zoo, and Shedd Aquarium are partnering
with the Wildlife Conservation Society, an international conservation organization that has launched “96
Elephants” a campaign named for the number of elephants killed each day in 2012 by poachers to raise
awareness about the alarming rate at which wild African elephants are being poached because of the
demand for ivory; to generate action in support of elephants and raise consumer awareness; and to
encourage state and federal lawmakers to eliminate the significant enforcement challenge posed by the
legal ivory trade;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, That, I, Toni Preckwinkle, along with the members of the Forest
Preserve District of Cook County Board of Commissioners and on behalf of all citizens of Cook County,
recognize the Chicago Zoological Society, Lincoln Park Zoo, and Shedd Aquarium for their efforts to
raise awareness of the plight of African elephants including a need for a statewide moratoria on all ivory
sales; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a suitable copy of this resolution be tendered to Dr. Stuart Strahl,
President and CEO of the Chicago Zoological Society and Director of the Brookfield Zoo; to Dr. Kevin
Bell, President and CEO of Lincoln Park Zoo; and to Ted A. Beattie, President and CEO of Shedd

EASEMENT REQUEST
Department: Planning and Development
Request: Requesting authorization for the Forest Preserve District of Cook County (“the Preserves”) to
grant a temporary easement to the Illinois Department of Transportation (“IDOT”) at Harts Road and the
North Branch of the Chicago River for 0.02 acre or 741 square feet.
Reason: IDOT requests a temporary construction easement to access the North Branch of the Chicago
River along the north side of Harts Road for a slope stabilization project. The slope stabilization is
necessary to ensure the continued operation and safety of the Harts Road Bridge over the river. This
remediation will stabilize the river bank and prevent further loss of soil, trees, and vegetation. The slope
stabilization will decrease the sediment load in the river, thus reducing surface water degradation and
stream siltation.
Slope stabilization utilizing a 12-inch tall stone slope mattress over 36-inch tall gabions is to be placed
along the banks of the North Branch Chicago River. A synthetic geo filter fabric will be placed on the
ground below the slope mattress and gabions. The area for the temporary easement is 0.02 acres. IDOT
indicates that 4 (four) trees are expected to be removed for this project.
