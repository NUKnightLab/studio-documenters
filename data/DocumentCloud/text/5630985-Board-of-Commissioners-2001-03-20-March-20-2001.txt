March 20, 2001
The Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority met in regular session on Tuesday, March
20, 2001 at 8:30 a.m. at the LeClaire Hearst Park District located at 5118 West 44th Street in
Chicago.

Dr. Mildred Harris

Also present were Terry Peterson, Chief Executive Officer; G.A. Finch, General Counsel;
Chicago Housing Authority Staff Members and the General Public.
There being a quorum present, the meeting duly convened and business was transacted as
follows:
The Chairperson convened the Public Hearing portion of the meeting by inviting residents and
the public at large to address the Board.
Immediately following the Public Hearing Session, Terry Peterson, Chief Executive Officer,
presented his monthly report. Mr. Peterson informed the Board of his visit to Washington where
he had an opportunity to meet and discuss major CHA issues with staff of HUD Secretary Mel
Martinez, House Speaker Denny Hastert and Senator Peter Fitzgerald. Mr. Peterson advised the
Board that the officials were encouraged by the Authority's mission since the Plan For
Transformation was consistent with many of the themes of the new administration. Mr. Peterson
reported that he was cautiously confident that President Bush and his new administration will
continue to support the Plan for Transformation. Next, Mr. Peterson reported on the progress of
work orders. According to Mr. Peterson, eighteen months ago, the Authority had a backlog of
more than 40,000 work order requests. By the end of last year, the backlog was eliminated and
virtually every emergency was handled within a day. Mr. Peterson concluded his report by
informing the Board that for the second year in a row, the CHA's Section 8 Program had been
rated a "high performer" by HUD. Indicators taken into consideration by HUD included:
relocation of residents into low poverty areas, inspection of units and assisting families become
self-sufficient.

 A motion was then introduced and seconded to adjourn to Executive Session. The Chairperson
announced that pursuant to the Open Meetings Act, 5 ILCS 120/2, the Board would adjourn for
approximately one (1) hour to discuss pending, probable or imminent litigation, collective
negotiating matters, security and personnel matters.
The Commissioners subsequently reconvened in Open Session whereby the departure of the
Chairperson was announced, due to a conflict in her schedule. Rahm Emanuel, Vice-Chairman,
thereupon introduced Item A1 discussed in Executive Session. Commissioner Darcy moved the
adoption of the following resolution for Item A1.
RESOLUTION NO. 2001-CHA-36
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the
Board Letter dated March 5, 2001 requesting that the Board of Commissioners
approve the Personnel Action Reports for February 2001.
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners hereby approves the Personnel Actions for February
2001.

Motion to adopt said resolution was seconded by Commissioner Gates and the voting was as
follows:
Ayes:
Hallie Amey
Mamie Bone
Michael Darcy
Rahm Emanuel
Dr. Mildred Harris
Andrew Mooney
Sandra Young
Earnest Gates
Nays:

None

The Vice-Chairman thereupon declared said motion carried and said resolution adopted.
Commissioner Darcy then presented the Finance & Audit Committee report due to the absence
of Committee Chairperson Leticia Davis. Per Commissioner Darcy, the Committee met on
Wednesday, March 14th at the Corporate Office located at 626 West Jackson. Staff presented the
Committee with the monthly Grants & Foundation and Treasury Report. During the month of
January and February 2001, staff submitted twelve (12) grant proposals to public, private and
corporate foundations, totaling approximately $3 million.
During this reporting period,
$400,000 was received from the MacArthur Foundation for a land-use plan and to help support
the Relocation Rights Contract training. For the period ending February 28, 2001, the
Authority's portfolio totaled $102,068 million, which is slightly higher than was projected. This
increase cash balance is primarily due to less than expected spending from Capital and
Development.
Commissioner Darcy then introduced an Omnibus Motion for the adoption of Items A1 and A2
recommended for approval by the Finance and Audit Committee.
(Item A1)
The resolution for Item A1 requests approval of insurance coverage for CHA's Private Managers
Insurance Program (PMIP). Near North Insurance Brokerage, Inc. (NNIB) was previously
selected as the Administrator/Broker of record for CHA's PMIP for the period of January 1998
through December 2001. In January 2001, an RFP was advertised seeking quotes to renew the
Primary General Liability & Excess Liability, Auto Liability, Workers Compensation,
Crime/Fidelity and Directors & Officers insurance coverage for CHA's PMIP. Of the two
proposals received, Midwestern Risk was deemed as the only responsive and responsible bidder
for Primary General/Excess Liability and Workers Compensation coverage. Accordingly, the
Authority secured approval from HUD to allow NNIB to procure Auto, Crime/Fidelity and
Director's & Officers coverage by non-competitive proposals from the incumbent insurance
carriers.

 RESOLUTION NO. 2001-CHA-37
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the

THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority authorizes the
Chief Executive Officer or his designee to procure through Near North Insurance
Brokerage, Inc. (“NNIB”), its Administrator/Broker of record for the CHA’s
Private Managers Insurance Program (the “PMIP”), the following required
insurance coverage for the PMIP: (1) Primary General Liability & Excess
Liability, (2) Auto Liability, (3) Workers Compensation, (4) Crime/Fidelity and
(5) Directors & Officers (RMCs only), for a total amount of premiums not-toexceed $1,751,060 for a one-year period of April 1, 2001 to March 31, 2002 and
to secure the right for two successive one year extension options, with the second
extension option subject to the approval of HUD.

(Item A2)
Item A2 requests authorization to execute the FY2000 HOPE VI Revitalization Grant
Agreement. In FY2000, CHA requested and was approved for $35,000,000 in Revitalization
funding for the development of 3,000 mixed-income units to replace 2,456 dilapidated units of
public housing. The signing of the Grant Agreement and accompanying HUD forms
memorializes and incorporates all documents relating to the grants including the February 2000
Notice of Funding Availability Application and subsequent documents.
RESOLUTION NO. 2001-CHA-38
WHEREAS, The Board of Commissioners has reviewed the memorandum dated March 5,
2001 “Authorization to execute FY2000 HOPE VI Revitalization Grant

with an update on Section 8 Management Assessment Program (SEMAP) scores. SEMAP
scores are indicators used by HUD to evaluate the Section 8 Program. Staff presented the
Committee with a synopsis and score of each indicator. Overall, staff estimates that the Section
8 Program will be rated a "high performer" by HUD due to CHAC's (administrators of the
Section 8 Program) demonstrated compliance of meeting or exceeding the established goals.

 Commissioner Gates then introduced an Omnibus Motion for the adoption of Items B1, B3 and
B4, recommended for approval by the Operations and Facilities Committee.
(Item B1)
Section 3.04 of the current Resident Management Agreement between the Authority and the
Dearborn Homes Resident Management Corporation (DHRMC) requires DHRMC to use a
competitive procurement process that is subject to the approval of the CHA Purchasing and
Contracts Department and Board of Commissioners for procurement over $100,000. The
resolution for Item B1 grants approval of the competitive procurement process held by the
DHRMC for roof and masonry work. The cost of this project is approximately $412,500 and
will be paid from Dearborn Home's excess reserves.
RESOLUTION NO. 2001-CHA-39
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the memorandum dated February 20
2001 entitled “Approval of the competitive procurement process of Dearborn
Homes Resident Management Corporation for roof and masonry work” and
concurs with the recommendations contained therein;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners approves the competitive procurement process
utilized by the Dearborn Homes Resident Management Corporation for roof and
masonry work at 2910 & 2701 S. Dearborn, 2901 S. Federal and 2710 S. State
and authorizes the award of this work to the recommended awardee, Oak
Construction.

(Item B2 - This Number Not Used)
(Item B3)
The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has responsibility
under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 for enforcement of the environmental
responsibilities applicable to any and all of the HUD grant assistance awarded to the CHA,
including that under the Moving to Work Demonstration Program. CHA's Plan for
Transformation will require the CHA to have environmental reviews conducted of various
project sites that will vary substantially in scope, depending on the nature and size of the project.
The resolution for Item B3 grants approval to execute an Intergovernmental Agreement with the
City of Chicago acting through its Department of the Environment (DOE) to perform
environmental reviews in order to comply with Federal laws and regulations.
RESOLUTION NO. 2001-CHA-40
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated, March 2, 2001
“Authorizing the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to execute an
Intergovernmental Agreement with the City of Chicago acting through its
Department of the Environment”.
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to execute an Intergovernmental Agreement with the City of Chicago
acting through its Department of the Environment (“DOE”) to perform
environmental reviews in compliance with 24 CFR Part 58 in order to comply
with Federal laws and regulations and made necessary by the CHA’s Plan for
Transformation approved as part of the Moving to Work Demonstration
Agreement with HUD. A total amount not-to-exceed $1,000,000 shall be
authorized for the first two (2) years of this Intergovernmental Agreement.

 (Item B4)
In November 1999, the Board of Commissioners granted approval to enter into a two-year
contract with Peoples Energy Service, Inc. to purchase natural gas to take advantage of Wellhead
gas prices and the potential gas savings pursuant to HUD's Rate Reduction incentive. Over the
past six months, gas costs have risen as much as 350% of the original average estimates
established in 1999, nearly exhausting the budgeted funds. It is estimated that the CHA will
need to purchase an additional $9,100,000 of Wellhead natural gas supplies for the remaining
contract period. Increasing the contract amount, under the existing contract, would allow the
CHA to continue realizing significant savings as opposed to what it would have to pay for gas
supplies by purchasing from the local utility.
RESOLUTION 2001-CHA-41
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated March 13, 2001
entitled “Authorization to modify Contract No. 9311 with Peoples Energy Service
Corporation” for the purpose of continuing the CHA’s purchases of Wellhead
natural gas supplies.
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to modify Contract No. 9311 with Peoples Energy Service Corporation
to increase the total not to exceed contract amount by an additional $9,100,000 for
the remaining contract period of March 1, 2001 to October 31, 2001, subject to
HUD's approval.

(Item B5 - Pulled)
The Omnibus Motion to adopt Items B1, B3 and B4 was seconded by Commissioner Young and
the voting was as follows:
Ayes:
Hallie Amey
Mamie Bone
Michael Darcy
Rahm Emanuel
Dr. Mildred Harris
Andrew Mooney
Sandra Young
Earnest Gates
Nays:

None

There being no questions or discussion, Commissioner Emanuel thereupon declared said motion
carried and said resolutions adopted. The report of the Operations and Facilities Committee was
also accepted in total.
Commissioner Young then introduced an Omnibus Motion for the adoption of Items C1 through
C3 discussed, voted and recommended for approval by the Tenant Services Committee that met
on Wednesday, March 14, 2001.
(Item C1)
Pursuant to the provisions of the Moving to Work Agreement, the Board approved the
Relocation Rights Contract in August 2000. The Relocation Rights Contract set forth the rights
and responsibilities between the CHA and residents who were in occupancy on 10-1-99 in the
event of permanent or temporary relocation. The resolution for Item C1 requests approval of the
CHA Relocation Rights Contract for families with initial occupancy after 10-1-99. The Post 101-99 Contract is similar to the Relocation Rights Contracts in many ways. While the Relocation
Rights Contract provides lease-compliant leaseholders with a right to return to public housing,
the Post 10-1-99 contract only provides lease-compliant leaseholders with a preference on CHA's
waiting lists over new admission.

 RESOLUTION NO. 2001-CHA-42
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated February 1,
2001 requesting approval of the CHA Relocation Rights Contract for families
with initial occupancy after 10-1-99;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners adopts the attached CHA Relocation Rights Contract
for families with initial occupancy after 10-1-99.

THAT,

this CHA Relocation Rights Contract for families with initial occupancy after 101-99 supersedes all conflicting language found in existing CHA policies and
procedures including the recently board-approved Admissions and Occupancy
Policy.

(Item C2)
The CHA submitted a proposal to the MacArthur Foundation for the purpose of training CHA
employees, private management firms and the CAC on the Lease and Relocation Rights
Contract. MacArthur, recognizing the need for this extensive training, awarded a grant to CHA
in the amount of $200,000 in accordance with CHA's proposal and submitted budget. The
resolution for Item C2 requests authorization to accept the award of this private grant and enter
into an agreement with ABT Associates to develop training material and conduct the required
training sessions.
RESOLUTION NO. 2001-CHA-43
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed Board Letter dated March 2, 2001
entitled “Authorization to accept an award of a private grant and to enter into an
agreement with ABT Associates, Inc.”.
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to: (1) accept an award of a Grant from the John D. and Catherine T.
MacArthur Foundation in the amount of $200,000; and (2) enter into a contract
with ABT Associates, Inc. to develop training materials and conduct training for
Chicago Housing Authority employees, private management firms and the Central
Advisory Council on the CHA Leaseholder Relocation Rights Contract and the
Residential Lease Agreement for an amount not to exceed $180,411 for the period
of April 1, 2001 to September 30, 2001, or until such training is completed.

(Item C3)
In June 2000, the Board approved a contract term of six months for Windows of Opportunity.
The scope of service within this contract provided that Windows raise private funding for
existing and new resident initiatives; and to serve as fiscal agent for grants that serve CHA
communities. Windows is currently undergoing a transition process to explore strategies to
expand its support to CHA communities and residents. Due to a late start on the initial contract
and the length of the transition process, the resolution for Item C3 approves a four-month
extension.
Commissioner Bone recused from voting on this item.
RESOLUTION NO. 2001-CHA-44
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the
Board Letter dated January 22, 2001 entitled "Authorization to extend the
Windows of Opportunity, Inc. contract";
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority hereby approves
the extension of the Windows of Opportunity contract from December 1, 2000
through March 31, 2001.
