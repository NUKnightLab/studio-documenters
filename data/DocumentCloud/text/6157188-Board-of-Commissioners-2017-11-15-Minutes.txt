PROPOSED RESOLUTION
REQUESTING TO PRESENT AN ADVISORY PUBLIC QUESTION VIA A COUNTYWIDE
REFERENDUM TO COOK COUNTY VOTERS ON WHETHER THE STATE OF ILLINOIS
14

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

November 15, 2017

SHOULD LEGALIZE, REGULATE AND TAX RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA USE FOR
ADULTS 21 AND OVER
WHEREAS, Pursuant to the Illinois Election Code, 10 ILCS 5/28-1, et seq., and the Counties Code, 55
ILCS 5/5-1005.5, the corporate authorities of a county have the authority to submit a public question to the
electors of the county by means of a referendum; and
WHEREAS, despite spending more than $1 Trillion over the last 40 years, the efforts of the “War on
Drugs”, the health and social costs of drugs increase every year, drugs are no less available than before, and
treatment is not available to the vast majority of people who need it; and
WHEREAS, existing evidence from other states and countries show there is no indication that
decriminalization or legalization of marijuana leads to a measurable increase in its use; and
WHEREAS, eight states and Washington D.C. have already legalized the recreational use of marijuana;
and
WHEREAS, marijuana-related arrests in every Cook County municipality, including Chicago, result in
staggering costs to Cook County government by virtue of the necessary involvement of the County jail,
Sheriff’s department, State’s Attorney, Clerk of the Court, judiciary, and often times, the Public Defender,
annually costing Cook County taxpayers tens of millions of dollars; and
WHEREAS, most arrests for marijuana possession do not lead to trials or prison terms. Instead, a large
number of these arrests are plea-bargained, continued without a finding, dismissed, or otherwise handled in
a manner that places unnecessary burdens on already-limited criminal justice system resources; and
WHEREAS, as Illinois and Cook County continually face severe budget and financial constraints and
lawmakers repeatedly face the undesirable choice of deciding between increasing taxes or substantial
service cuts, or both, creating an intelligent, practical framework of cannabis legalization, regulation and
taxation can help address a myriad of problems such as improved health and public safety, reduced criminal
justice and jail costs, law enforcement efficacy, black market drug displacement as well as increased
revenue for education and treatment protocols; and
WHEREAS, legalizing, regulating and taxing recreational marijuana use for adults 21 and over and would
have an estimated revenue impact of $350 to $699 million at the state level and would also have a positive
multi-million-dollar impact for Cook County via sales tax proceeds and other public and private revenue
streams; and
WHEREAS, a recent 2017 Gallup poll has shown that 64% of Americans are in favor of legalizing
marijuana; and
WHEREAS, a recent 2017 poll conducted by the Paul Simon Public Policy Institute finds that two-thirds
of Illinois voters, support or strongly support legalization of recreational marijuana if it is taxed and
regulated like alcohol, and in Chicago, 74 percent of voters support or strongly support legalization of
marijuana while in suburban Cook and the collar counties support or strong support is at 70 percent; and

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
CALLING FOR COOK COUNTY PUBLIC SAFETY STAKEHOLDERS TO WORK TOGETHER
ON A COURT UTILIZATION STUDY
WHEREAS, based on Clerk of the Circuit Court for Cook County data for 2016 and 2017, there has been
a 47.8% decline in new court cases over the last 10 years across all case types. More specifically, there has
16

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

November 15, 2017

been a 35.4% decline in civil cases, a 56.8% decline in criminal cases, and a 49.5% decline in traffic cases;
and
WHEREAS, this continued decline in case volume suggests that the Circuit Court of Cook County’s 333
courtrooms, originally built to handle the large case volume of the 1970s and 1980s, may currently have
excess capacity; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Circuit Court Branch Court locations are in some of the poorest physical
conditions of any Cook County court houses, needing $25.3 million in repairs over the next 10 years; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Criminal Justice Stakeholders are working continuously and cooperatively
to safely reduce the financial burden of operating the criminal justice system upon Cook County taxpayers;
and
WHEREAS, effective reforms may be instituted only with the support of comprehensive data, accessible
to and acceptable to all of the stakeholders; and
WHEREAS, in light of the need for functional and safe courthouses for the efficient operations of the Cook
County Circuit Court System as well the aging facilities, there is a need to determine what resources will
be needed in the future and what alternatives are available to secure those resources; and
WHEREAS, a courtroom utilization study should be performed so that the use of the Cook County Circuit
Court courtrooms (including Branch Courts and District Court Houses) may be maximized, with court calls
correctly sized and scheduled based on a complete understanding of when, for how long and in what ways,
courtrooms are used; and
WHEREAS, such a study should be obtained from an appropriate vendor, capable of providing a brief but
comprehensive report outlining the best practices and recent trends. The scope of the study should include
but not be limited to:
A review of the existing documents and reports prepared by the Bureau of Asset Management
including but not limited to space utilization plans and Facilities Building Assessment reports;
A review of the needs for the judicial system and its’ associated spaces;
A review of the organizational needs for each of the public safety offices;
Proposed solutions for reallocation & reorganization; and
Probable cost(s) for the work proposed.
WHEREAS, the commissioned study shall also at a minimum include a breakdown of the following:
Number of cases heard;
Types of cases heard;
Length (time) of each hearing(s); and
Location of hearing.
WHEREAS, the selected vendor, in coordination with the Bureau of Asset Management, will work with
Department of Budget and Management Services, Sheriff’s Office, and Office of the Chief Judge to
establish a formal process and reporting mechanism to ensure that all stakeholders understand roles and
responsibilities as well as project deliverables, budgets and schedules for the Project Team; and
17

WHEREAS, in partnership with the Bureau of Asset Management and Department of Budget and
Management Services, all the public safety offices including the Office of the Chief Judge, Sheriff’s Office,
Public Defender’s Office, State’s Attorney’s Office, Clerk of the Circuit Court’s Office and the Justice
Advisory Council shall participate in the planning process and provide any and all necessary data and
evidence needed for the study, excluding any data and evidence limited by law; and
WHEREAS, time is of the essence and to the extent possible the project should be completed as quickly
as possible but no later than May, 2018; and
WHEREAS, the courtroom utilization study will provide valuable guidance for further consideration of
the investment of general revenue in the operation as well as repair and rehabilitation of courtrooms used
by the criminal justice stakeholders and the buildings in which such courtrooms are located.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that the public
safety stakeholders work collaboratively with an external vendor managed by the Bureau of Asset
Management on a Court Utilization Study and that they be prepared to brief the Board on their progress
and final results of the study.

PROPOSED TRANSFER OF FUNDS
Department: Department of Revenue
Request: Transfer of Funds
Reason: Additional postage dollars will fund the last month of Home Rule Tax Compliance Notices for
FY 2017 and the Sweetened Beverage Tax (SBT) repeal notification to registered taxpayers.
From Account(s): 1007.520825, $25,000.00
To Account(s): 1007.520260, $25,000.00
Total Amount of Transfer: $25,000.00
On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
It became apparent Oct 10th, after SBT Repeal, that the receiving account would require an infusion of
funds for Q4 to continue with the Home Rule Tax Compliance mailings. At that time, the balance in the
account was $18,000.00, and was at this level 30 days prior.
How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
The departments will repurpose unused funds that were initially set aside for temporary staffing service in
the first year of SBT implementation. The funds will be transferred from the professional service account,
as these funds are no longer required.
Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from.

None
If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
Originally, the department appropriated funds for temporary staffing to assist with 2017 first year
implementation of the SBT. Those funds are no longer required as services have been terminated.

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

November 15, 2017

Summary: In the Federal FY 2017 budget, Congress appropriated an additional $40 million in
Supplemental ESG funds. HUD made the supplemental funds available through a formula allocation, and
Cook County was notified about this additional ESG funding after our initial ESG grant amount was
released in June. The supplemental funds can be used for rapid rehousing and all other critical eligible
ESG activities. This is a one-time allocation, with no expectation of future supplemental funding.
Recipients will track these funds with its annual formula allocation. The County will be working with our
agency partners to determine the process for programming these supplemental funds.
I respectfully request approval of this ESG grant amendment; and that the Bureau Chief of Economic
Development or his/her designee be authorized to execute, on behalf of the County of Cook, any and all
documents necessary to further the approval herein, including but not limited to, subrecipient agreements,
intergovernmental agreements, amendments, and modifications thereto.

Summary: The Office of the Chief Judge, Circuit Court of Cook County (OCJ) requests a new, one-year
contract with Northwestern University to clinically staff and manage mental health services for
court-involved youth in Cook County. The contract is designed to avoid a lapse in mental health services
during the interim period that a Request for Proposals (RFP) for fully integrated mental health services is

completed and a new vendor is selected. The interim contract would replace the two separate, current
contracts with (1) The Isaac Ray Center, Inc., which expires 11/30/2017; and, (2) Northwestern
University, which expires 12/31/2017. The Isaac Ray Center provides clinical mental health services at
the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center (JTDC) under contract number 10-41-68; and Northwestern
University currently manages the Cook County Juvenile Court Clinic under contract 10-41-14.
In the spring of 2015, as part of the transition process from federal oversight of the JTDC, Chief Judge
Timothy Evans appointed The Circuit Court of Cook County Committee on the Transition of the Juvenile
Temporary Detention Center (“The Committee”). The Committee included expert-led subcommittees that
were designed to make recommendations for system improvements concerning youth-serving
departments. The Committee concluded, “Positive outcomes and future opportunities for youth” should not
only be the operational focus for the JTDC, but should also be the focus of all youth-serving departments.
In addition, the Health/Mental Health Care sub-committee recommended that the Chief Judge commission
a study of the feasibility of consolidating the mental health services currently offered by the JTDC, the
Juvenile Probation and Court Services Department (Probation), and the Juvenile Court Clinic.
In response, Chief Judge Evans asked the Chapin Hall Center for Children at the University of Chicago
(Chapin Hall) to conduct an independent review of relevant mental health screening, assessment, referral,
and service delivery practices, and make recommendations to help achieve an integrated system of mental
health for youth involved with the Juvenile Justice Division of the Cook County Circuit Court. Specific
deliverables included recommendations for addressing problem areas based on a comprehensive review of
how current mental health screening, assessment, referral processes and relevant clinical interventions
function in comparison to evidence from existing literature about best practices. As a result of the Chapin
Hall review, the OCJ has been working to develop a RFP that establishes and implements fully integrated
mental health services across the court services continuum. This contract would provide time required to
complete the procurement process.
This is a sole source contract pursuant to Section 34-139 of the Cook County Procurement Code.

Total Amount of Transfer: $100,000
On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
In August 2017, after the court received notice of the change in transcript rates, it became apparent that
the court reporter transcripts account would require an infusion of funds in order to meet current
obligations. The remaining account balance in late October was $15,571; 30 days prior to that date, the
remaining balance in the account was $51,363.
In late October 2017, it became apparent that the modest travel accounts for Department 310, the Office
of the Chief Judge and Department 300, the Judiciary, would require and infusion of funds in order to
meet current obligations. The balances in the accounts then, as well as the month prior were zero.
In late October 2017, it became apparent that the office supplies account for the Office of the Chief Judge,
Department. 310 would require an infusion of funds in order to meet current obligations. The remaining
account balance then on was $8,014 and 30 days prior to that date, the balance was $9,015.
How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
The account proposed as the source of funds for the Court Reporter Transcript account is the Judiciary’s
account for books and periodicals. This account was identified as having sufficient funds to meet any
pending obligations for the remainder of the year. No other accounts were considered as a source of the
transferred funds.
The account proposed as the source of funds for the travel and office supplies accounts is the food for
jurors. Late in the year, in order to meet the county’s budget mandates, the court eliminated breakfast and
snacks for jurors. As such, this account was identified as having sufficient funds to meet any pending
obligations for the remainder of year. No other accounts were considered as a source of the transferred
funds.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from.
A moratorium has been placed on the books that can be ordered for the remainder of this fiscal year.
If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
The transfer of funds will not cause a reduction in services from the 1110.1310.10210.520210 account.
Due to a recent effort to reduce costs, breakfasts and snack meals have been eliminated from juror food in
August 2017. This reduction in service will allow for the transfer of funds without negatively impacting
service.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
In cooperation with the budget office’s request for a 10% reduction, and as we communicated to
Commissioners in our October 20, 2017 letter, we are re-prioritizing spending for the March and
November 2018 elections by utilizing FY17 savings.
Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from.
None.
If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
The number of precincts during municipal elections varies each year. We must account for the possibility
of a greater number of primary municipal elections.

PROPOSED GRANT AWARD
Department: Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office
Grantee: Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office
Grantor: U.S. Department of Justice
Request: Authorization to accept grant
Purpose: State and local law enforcement agencies receive equitable sharing funds by participating
jointly with Department of Justice agencies on investigations that lead to the seizure and forfeiture of
property. Once an investigation is completed and the seized assets are forfeited, the assisting state and
local law enforcement agencies can request a share of the forfeited assets or a percentage of the proceeds
derived from the sale of forfeited assets. Generally, the degree of a state or local agency’s direct
participation in an investigation determines the amount or percentage of funds shared with the agency.
Before requesting a share of the seized assets, a state or local law enforcement agency must first become a
member of the DOJ Equitable Sharing Program. To participate in the program, agencies sign and submit
to DOJ an equitable sharing agreement and certification form. The agreement must be renewed annually,
and by signing and submitting the agreement, the officials of participating agencies certify that they will
use equitable sharing funds for law enforcement purposes.
Grant Amount: TBD
Grant Period: 12/1/2017 - 11/30/2020
Fiscal Impact: None
Accounts: TBD
Concurrences:
The Budget Department has received all the requisite documents and determined the fiscal impact on
Cook County, if any.
Summary: The Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office has participated in this program since 2008.
Attached is an Equitable Sharing Guide Programs that speaks to its purpose more broadly.

Agreement Number(s): N/A
Summary/Notes: The Office of the Chief Judge (“OCJ”) is the lead sponsoring agency of the Cook
County Circuit Court’s Automated Court Reminder System (ACRS). The Chief Judge, on behalf of the
Cook County Criminal Justice Stakeholders, is requesting authorization to enter into an intergovernmental
Agreement (“IGA” or “Agreement”) between Cook County and the Chicago Police Department (CPD).
This IGA sets forth the terms and understanding between the OCJ, Clerk of the Circuit Court, Cook County
Sheriff’s Office; Cook County Public Defender’s Office, Bureau of Technology (collectively “Cook
County Stakeholders” or “Stakeholders”), and the CPD (collectively, “Parties”) to implement and manage
the ACRS.
The Cook County Board established the Cook County Integrated Criminal Justice Information System
(“CCICJIS”) Committee to “improve the public safety and protect the civil liberties of the citizens of Cook
County by improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the Cook County criminal justice system”.
Through the collaborative efforts of the CCICJIS Committee, on 9/1/2014 the Cook County Stakeholders
entered into a Memorandum of Agreement in Support of an Integrated Information Sharing Enterprise,
providing general principles for the sharing of criminal justice data among the Stakeholders.
This is an agreement to share data, and telephone numbers provided with the consent of persons in contact
with law enforcement and the criminal justice system, so that they can receive automated telephone and
text message reminders through the ACRS. Reminding defendants of their next court date will
consequently reduce the number of bench warrants and failures to appear, thereby reducing the financial
and social costs of incarceration to defendants and Cook County. As such, the Cook County Stakeholders
and the Parties wish to share criminal justice data and responsibilities related to operating the ACRS,

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

November 15, 2017

RESOLUTION CALLING ON COOK COUNTY TO ASSESS ITS LACTATION ROOMS AND
LACTATION ROOM POLICIES IN AN EFFORT TO BEST MEET THE NEEDS OF NURSING
MOTHERS IN ITS FACILITIES
WHEREAS, breastfeeding offers proven health benefits for babies and mothers, but women often find it
difficult to continue breastfeeding once they return to the workplace; and
WHEREAS, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), among employed women
with children under age 3, approximately 70 percent work full time and one-third of mothers return to work
within 3 months after giving birth, and two-thirds return within 6 months; and
WHEREAS, challenges to breastfeeding mothers include lack of break time and inadequate facilities for
pumping and storing human milk; and
WHEREAS, providing accommodations for breastfeeding offers numerous rewards for the employer, in
cost savings for health care, reduced absenteeism, employee morale, and employee retention; and
WHEREAS, Cook County and its facilities are unique in that they must accommodate county employees,
workers who are not employed by Cook County but who perform some of their job duties in county
facilities, as well as members of the general public; and
WHEREAS, many of the challenges facing breastfeeding mothers can be reduced with a small investment
of time, money, and flexibility; and
WHEREAS, some Cook County buildings and courthouses currently have space reserved for breastfeeding
mothers, but some challenges remain, and it is incumbent upon this body to evaluate existing resources and
see where there is opportunity for improvement;
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that the county
shall undertake an evaluation of its current lactation rooms and policies for those rooms, with the goal of
having all public buildings owned and operated by Cook County with a designated private room, other than
a restroom, for persons seeking privacy to nurse or express milk, including members of the public where
appropriate; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the private room shall at a minimum include an electrical outlet, a
chair, and a lockable door. Windows, if any, in the private room must have a window treatment appropriate
to ensure privacy; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the management of each building shall make all building staff aware
of the room(s) that have been designated for the use of nursing mothers and what the procedure is should a
member of the public request use of the room(s); and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that all public buildings owned and operated by Cook County post a sign
at the building entrance and outside the public restrooms indicating the availability of the designated room
and the procedure for accessing it; and

requirements and shall notify all of its Employees annually of any adjustment to the Living
Wage. In addition, the Employer shall notify its Employees that if any Employee contends that

has violated this section, it shall (i) in the case of an Employer receiving a property tax
incentive, notify the Assessor and the municipality, or the County, as the case may be; or (ii)

not be imposed on any Person except after a hearing (Cook County, Ill., Code, Ch. 2, Art. IX).
Further, if an Employer is found to be in violation of this section, the property tax incentive for

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
TO CONSIDER PERMITTING VIDEO GAMING IN UNINCORPORATED COOK COUNTY
WHEREAS, The State of Illinois enacted P.A. 96-34 known as the Video Gaming Act, 230 ILCS 40,
legalizing video gaming in July of 2009; and
232

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

November 15, 2017

WHEREAS, Section 58-161 of the Cook County Code of Ordinances currently prohibits the operation of
video gaming devices in places of public resort within the unincorporated areas of Cook County; and
WHEREAS, several municipalities in Cook County authorize and license video gaming, as such licensed
establishments in these municipalities offer the added attraction of video gaming and enjoy an unfair
advantage over their competitors located in unincorporated Cook County; and
WHEREAS, several municipalities that previously prohibited video gaming have decided to reconsider
their ban after neighboring communities started to allow video gambling terminals; and
WHEREAS, eighty-nine (89) out of a total of one hundred and twenty (120) municipalities in Cook County
have now authorized video gaming in Cook County; and
WHEREAS, geographic areas within unincorporated Cook County, including fifty-nine (59) businesses
currently possessing Cook County liquor licenses, are barred from operating video gaming by virtue of
Cook County not allowing video gaming in unincorporated Cook County; and
WHEREAS, establishments in unincorporated Cook County that otherwise could be licensed for video
gaming but for the County’s ban are at a competitive disadvantage over establishments in municipalities in
Cook County that permit video gaming.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners shall
reconsider the ban on video gaming in unincorporated Cook County, which would level the playing field
for establishments in the unincorporated areas; and
NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners directs the
Department of Revenue, Department of Finance, Cook County Sheriff and all other various stakeholders to
work together to suggest any necessary public policy and public safety determinations necessary to permit
video gaming in unincorporated Cook County and make recommendations regarding any necessary
ordinance provisions, regulations, and license fees.

BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners, that Chapter 2, Administration, Article
IV Officers and Employees, Division 5 Inspector General, Section 2-285 - Cooperation of the Cook County
Code is hereby amended as Follows:
Sec. 2-285. Cooperation.
(a) It shall be the duty of all County employees, officials, agents, contractors, subcontractors, licensees,
grantees or persons or businesses seeking County contracts, grants, licenses, or certification of eligibility
for County contracts, to cooperate with the OIIG in the conduct of investigations undertaken pursuant to
this division. Every County contract and every bid, proposal, application or solicitation for a County
contract and every application for certification of eligibility for a County contract or program shall contain
a statement that the person, individually and on behalf of the applicant, will abide by all provisions of this
division. It shall be unlawful for any person subject to this Section to refuse to cooperate with the
Independent Inspector General as required by this Section. The penalty for such violation shall be governed
by Section 2-291.
(b) All persons with whom the OIIG requests an interview are required to comply in a timely fashion.
Within constitutional limitations, failure by any County employee, official, agent, contractor, subcontractor,
licensee, grantee or person or business seeking County contracts, grants, licenses, or certification of
eligibility for County contracts, to cooperate with any reasonable request by the OIIG carries the threat of
sanctions and/or criminal contempt proceedings, and any other penalties the County Board has within its
scope to assess.
(c) Nothing in this compliance section may be interpreted to allow the OIIG to violate any individual's
constitutional rights, including the 5th Amendment right against self-incrimination.
(d) It is the duty of every employee, department and elected official to cooperate with the Independent
Inspector General in any investigation or hearing. Each department's premises, equipment, personnel,
books, records and papers shall be made readily available to the Independent Inspector General.
(e) If the Independent Inspector General issues a recommendation of corrective action to the head of a
County department or bureau, that department or bureau head must respond to that recommendation within
30 days with a written response to the Independent Inspector General and Chief of the Bureau of Human
Resources. This response must include either (1) a description of any corrective action the department or
bureau head has taken or (2) a request for a 30-day extension of the 30-day decision period if additional
time is needed by the department or bureau head to review the recommendation of corrective action. If the
head of that department or bureau did not take any corrective action, or took a different corrective action
than that recommended by the Independent Inspector General, the department or bureau head must describe
the different action and explain the reasons for the different action in the written response. This response
must be submitted to the Independent Inspector General and Chief of the Bureau of Human Resources
within the 30-day decision period. The Independent Inspector General may approve a request for an
234

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

extension of this 30-day decision period for a period of time not to exceed 30 days if additional time is
needed by the head of the department or bureau to review the recommendation of corrective action. If a
department, bureau, or separately elected official fails to meet the 30 day requirement or, if approved, the
30 day extension, the department head, bureau chief or separately elected official must appear before the
next meeting of the Finance Sub-Committee on Litigation to explain the reasoning for failing to reply. The
Independent Inspector General shall notify the chair of the Litigation Sub-Committee when there is a failure
to reply.
(f) It shall be the duty of all County employees, officials, agents, contractors, subcontractors, licensees,
grantees or persons or businesses seeking County contracts, grants, licenses, or certification of eligibility
for County contracts to report, directly and without undue delay, to the Independent Inspector General any
and all information concerning conduct which they know to involve corruption, allegations of political
discrimination in nonexempt positions or other criminal activity, by another County employee or official,
which concerns his or her office of employment or County related transaction. The knowing failure of any
employee to report as required above shall constitute cause for discipline up to and including termination.
For purposes of this Section, a report made to the Inspector General Hotline shall be considered a direct
report.
Effective date: This ordinance shall be in effect immediately upon adoption.
