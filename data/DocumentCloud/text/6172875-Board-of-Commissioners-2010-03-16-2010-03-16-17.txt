 EXPLANATION
On June 21, 2005 the Board authorized CHA to enter into a contract for redevelopment of
Cabrini Green Extension North with Parkside Associates, LLC (“Parkside Associates” or
“Development Team”). The Development Team is comprised of Holsten Real Estate
Development Corporation (“Holsten”) and the Cabrini Green Local Advisory Council’s (“LAC”)
Community Development Corporation. Parkside Associates is responsible for the overall
redevelopment process of Parkside and is also responsible for preparing funding applications,
obtaining financing, construction, and the coordination of community and supportive services
(“CSS”).
In November 2005, pursuant to the CHA’s selection of the Development Team and the
representations made in its proposal that Holsten would provide CSS for the new mixed income
community, the Board authorized the CHA to negotiate and enter into a one-year contract with
two (2) one-year options with Holsten to provide CSS for Cabrini Green residents desiring to
move into Parkside. The Board authorized the first one-year option in March 2007 and the
second one-year option in January 2008, continuing the provision of CSS to assist CHA families
that have chosen to return to Parkside. In 2009, the Board approved an extension of the
agreement to continue services to families leasing at Parkside. The CSS was designed to address
the barriers a family may face in meeting the site specific criteria allowing them to return to
Parkside.
In 2009, Holsten provided services to Cabrini families desiring to return to Parkside and
completed the leasing of units to 107 families. The current extension request and additional
funding will allow Holsten to continue providing post-occupancy services to those 107 families
residing at Parkside. CSS will remain focused on assessment and service planning, case
management and employment services. The post-occupancy services will include identifiable
outcomes similar to those of the FamilyWorks program. CHA staff will monitor and perform
quality assurance of the services provided through the review of monthly performance reports,
quarterly monitoring visits and participant file reviews.
Based on the foregoing, it is in the best interest of the Chicago Housing Authority to authorize
the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to extend Contract No. 5164 with Holsten to provide
CSS in support of the redevelopment at Parkside for the period of April 1, 2010 through March
31, 2011 and to increase the Contract’s funding by an amount not-to-exceed $400,000, adding it
to the carryover balance available at the end of the current contract term.
