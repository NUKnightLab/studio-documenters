Page 11 of 11

Since this memorandum is the official notification of Budget Committee action taken on May 12, 2016, the
following is a reminder to the members of the Authority’s organizational rules regarding committee
oversight. Section 1750.340(I) of the Authority’s Organizational Rules states:
i)

Oversight of Committees—In order to provide for oversight by the Authority of actions
taken by any committee, whether ad hoc or standing, Authority members shall be
notified—by phone, mail or equivalent—of all motions passed by a particular committee,
within five (5) business days of any committee meeting, or prior to the next meeting of
that committee, or before the next meeting of the Authority, whichever is sooner. Within
ten (10) business days of receipt of such information, a special meeting of the Authority
may be convened upon the request of five (5) Authority members, for the purpose of fully
discussing any action taken by a committee and to supersede the authorization granted to
the committee to act on the Authority’s behalf in any particular matter.

Subject to the oversight process described above, the Budget Committee action becomes the action of the
Authority.

Please contact me if you have any questions.
