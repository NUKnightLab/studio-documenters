estimates for Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County. William T. Foley, System Chief Executive Officer, noted
that the final report and executive summary on the performance improvement assessment would be provided
later on at this meeting; a large part of that report dealt with labor productivity and led to the background

III. Report from Chairman of the Board (continued)
Update on CCHHS Smoke-Free Campuses
Chairman Batts introduced Dr. Robert Cohen, from the Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine,
who reported that as of November 19, 2009, smoking will be prohibited on all System properties. Dr. Cohen
thanked all of those involved in the implementation of this policy, including Lucio Guerrero, System Director
of Public Relations and Community Affairs, and Kristina Photakis, from Mr. Foley’s office.
Board Education – Report on Internal Medicine Residency Training Program, John H. Stroger, Jr.
Hospital of Cook County
Chairman Batts noted that, starting with this meeting and going forward, the Board will dedicate time for
Board education. For this meeting’s Board education presentation, Dr. Suja Mathew, Program Director for the
Department of Medicine, presented a report on the Internal Medicine Residency Training Program
(Attachment #1).
Discussion of Academic Relationships
The Board briefly discussed the subject of System relationships with other private hospitals. Director
Carvalho noted that, in the past, the County’s decision to enter into these types of relationships has been based
upon whether it is in the County’s best interests to do so. Director Muñoz stated that he is interested in
reviewing the relationship with Rush. Mr. Foley stated that currently, there is a group that is looking at all of
the System’s academic relationships; additionally, they will be looking at all of these relationships as the
System advances to the implementation phase for performance improvement.
IV.

Report from Chief Executive Officer
A. Strategic planning update
Mr. Foley provided an update on strategic planning efforts. He stated that, according to the original
schedule, the plan was to be presented and approved by the Board this month. However, they want to take
the time to further analyze the issues and the input received. He noted that he believes that the basic
essence of the plan is solid; particularly in looking at how access can be better addressed. He added that
the issue of access is not solely related to geography; he believes that in order to address the issue of
access, this also includes fixing what is broken within the System, whether it is related to scheduling,
processes, etc. Additionally, Mr. Foley stated that he believes that the concept of focusing on
comprehensive outpatient services by transitioning to the proposed regional healthcare centers,
strategically located throughout the County (previously referred to as “hubs”), is the right thing to do.
John Abendshien, of Integrated Clinical Services, Inc., provided an update (Attachment #2) of the work in
progress relating to the strategic plan. He stated that they have taken the work plan and looked at some
specific steps that need to be taken between now and the February time period in order to bring the plan to
completion, and to drill-down in some of the specific areas where there have been questions, to ensure that
there is analytic support for the direction. He added that there are some areas that, under any scenario,
management needs to move ahead in terms of implementing some of the operational initiatives. He
referenced changes that have been made to the strategic initiative framework, and noted that one of the
changes is to revise the nomenclature of the concept previously referred to as “hubs”; these are now
generically described as “regional comprehensive outpatient delivery sites”.
Mr. Abendshien proceeded with the update. The Board reviewed and discussed the information.

Report from Chief Executive Officer
A. Strategic planning update (continued)
Extensive discussion took place on the following subjects: previous directions discussed and affirmed at
the Board’s October 7th retreat, specifically with regard to service line development initiatives; the
financial plan for the strategic plan; and potential budgetary ramifications relating to the possibility that the
Cook County Board will vote to roll-back the sales tax at their upcoming meeting.
During the discussion on maximizing the System’s income, Mr. Foley stated that MedAssets is currently
working on this; additionally, this information is incorporated into the budget, along with the opportunities
identified in the performance improvement assessment. Director Muñoz requested a report on how this
information is trending, in order to get a sense of whether there can be additional improvement and how
additional opportunities can be found.
Also addressed during the discussion on the System’s income was the issue of funding inequities relating
to the existing financial structure. Director Carvalho noted that in 2009, the System successfully worked
to bring in hundreds of millions in additional revenue. However, due to the financial structure in place
with the County, the System did not receive credit for securing this additional revenue. Michael Ayres,
System Chief Financial Officer, provided additional information on the subject, and added that this issue
stems from the fact that this is an appropriations-controlled budget, not a “bottom-line” budget.
Director Ansell recommended that the issue of financial restructuring be remanded to the Finance
Committee, so that a decision can be made on whether the System Board should commission a report on
System’s financial structure, standing separately from the strategic plan. Director Muñoz noted that the
Audit and Compliance Committee should be involved in this discussion, as it involves historical funding
issues. Director Zopp stated that although this is a critical piece to the strategic plan, she felt that there
shouldn’t be a separate commission on the financing; she felt that this could complicate matters. In
response to the comments, Mr. Foley recommended that they include financial restructuring as the 6th core
goal in the strategic plan.
Director Ansell, seconded by Director Golden, moved to direct the Finance Committee and Audit and
Compliance Committee to conduct in-depth discussions and present recommendations on how to proceed
with structural changes to the existing funding structure.
Director Zopp expressed concerns, stating that the System must first have their own vision of what the
financing structure ought to be; she believed that the Board should review the financing options, then
decide the direction, and move on to the processes of how to do it.
Director Ansell explained the reasons for his recommendation and motion. He stated that he prefers that
issues are vetted through the committee structure, to allow for a broader discussion. Secondly, in the
strategic plan, there are long-term and a short-term recommendations; there are actions that need to take
place right away, including this issue. He added that this issue is not new; many Directors are very
familiar with the issue and have a great deal of expertise on the subject. He stated that he prefers that the
Board deal with it directly, rather than have Mr. Abendshien’s group include it as part of their efforts.
Additionally, he noted that there could be a lot of external support, including those who were previously
involved in the Blue Ribbon Committee, who could be useful in the review of this subject.

Report from Chief Executive Officer
A. Strategic planning update (continued)
On the motion, Chairman Batts called for a vote. A vote was taken, however, prior to Chairman Batts’
declaration of the outcome of the vote, the Board returned to discussion of the matter, thereby leaving the
motion pending.
Director Carvalho requested clarification on the motion, and noted that at the next Finance Committee
meeting, they have requested and are expecting to receive the financial aspects of the plan. He asked
whether the motion that was intended was to ask the Finance Committee and Audit and Compliance
Committee to think about what structural changes or strategies they would recommend to be able to
implement the strategic plan.
Director Zopp, seconded by Director Butler, moved to amend the motion, to direct the Finance Committee
and Audit and Compliance Committee to conduct in-depth discussions and present recommendations on
the financing plan. On the motion, as amended, a voice vote was taken and THE MOTION CARRIED
UNANIMOUSLY.
B. Update on H1N1 efforts
Dr. Stephen Martin, Chief Operating Officer of the Cook County Department of Public Health, presented
an update on H1N1 efforts. He stated that as of November 7th, it was the seventh straight week in which
influenza activity has increased. The activity level for this week in suburban Cook County is 4% higher
than the previous week.
Dr. Martin provided additional information on the number of vaccines received and administered, and
provided an update on further activity planned for the distribution and administration of the vaccine. He
stated that as of November 14th, the System has administered 8,552 doses of the vaccine and has received
16,526 doses of the vaccine from the City of Chicago’s Department of Public Health and the Cook County
Department of Public Health. As of November 16th, the Cook County Department of Public Health
received 184,500 doses of the vaccine in six presentation types. As of November 30th, the Health
Department has vaccinated 30,000 school children, has distributed over 19,100 doses to hospitals in the
System, and has loaned 1,600 doses to municipal certified health departments. To date, they have
distributed, administered, or loaned 57,550 doses.
In response to Director Muñoz’ questions regarding whether the influenza activity is higher than in
previous years, Dr. Martin responded affirmatively. Additionally, Dr. Martin noted that they are not
seeing good vaccination rates among the African-American community; therefore, they are re-aligning
their outreach strategies in response to this issue.
C. Introduction of Thomas Schroeder, Director of Internal Audit
Mr. Foley introduced and welcomed the new System Director of Internal Audit, Thomas Schroeder.

 Internal Medicine Residency Training Program, John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital of Cook
County
Presented to the Board of Directors of the Cook County Health and Hospitals System
November 19, 2009
Suja Mathew, M.D., Program Director, Department of Medicine
The Internal Medicine Residency Program is a well -developed, well- established
clinical training program with significant laurels.
• The admissions process is highly competitive and selective. Less than 1% of
applicants are selected for entry. Applicants report interest in our program
based on the following: the opportunity to actively participate in the care of
patients with complex pathology; and the distinct, world-renowned practice of
evidence-based clinical reasoning on our Medicine services.
• The Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education has given the
Stroger Hospital Internal Medicine Residency Program full accreditation for
the maximum time period of 6 years.
• Approximately 50% of our graduates pursue fellowship training, and are
placed in competitive fellowships in all the internal medicine core subspecialties. The remainder continues the practice of general internal medicine,
in both the hospital and ambulatory settings.
• Our three-year American Board of Internal Medicine certifying exam passage
rate meets or exceeds the rates of the country’s most prestigious academic
medical centers.
The Internal Medicine Residency Program is an integral player in the Department
of Medicine’s clinical mission.
• Residents participate in the care of every patient admitted to the Department
of Medicine clinical services. They help to staff 12 general medicine ward
services, 4 HIV inpatient services, the MICU, the CCU, and the Short-stay
unit; help provide consultative services to every department in the hospital, in
all medicine sub-specialty areas; and provide staffing to the emergency room.
They spend one half-day per week as outpatient primary care providers in the
General Medicine Clinic, providing continuity of care to patients discharged
from the Medicine ward services.
• Unique aspects of our training program facilitate the integration of clinical
care and education, including the format of teaching activities such as
morning report.
• The housestaff play an important role in the Department’s quality
improvement activities. Examples include 1) Hand-offs of care are
standardized on the Medicine inpatient services, in accordance with NPSG 2;
2) Residents are first and immediate responders to calls for an Early
Response, in accordance with NPSG 16; 3) Housestaff provide discharge
summaries to patients at the time of discharge, including medication
reconciliation, in accordance with NPSG 8.
• The ability to recruit and retain high quality attending physicians in the
Department of Medicine is improved by the residency program.

 III. CLINICAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
The Clinical Resource Management assessment was designed to help CCHHS improve clinical and
operational practices and patterns while maintaining and improving, where possible, patient care.
This initiative required focused reviews in several areas:

Analysis of length of
stay (LOS)

Evaluation of processes
across the patient care
continuum to identify
opportunities to improve
patient flow, cost per patient
encounter, patient
satisfaction, and capacity

Identification of opportunities
to enhance cost, quality and
service through strengthening

IV. SUPPLY CHAIN:
The approach to Supply Chain improvement was developed around the principles of client interaction,
knowledge transfer, and sustained improvement. This process involved:
Benchmarking using NCI database for comparative hospitals
Conducting a second level of analysis using product and payment reports to identify specific
pricing and utilization opportunities to develop a portfolio of opportunities and savings potential

 V. LABOR – PREMIUM PAY
•

CCHHS hospitals are well above the NCI overtime benchmark of 2% of total worked hours.

•

NCI recommends Agency Hours at the benchmark of 1% of total worked hours, but there is not a
comprehensive data source to track Agency hours, so the opportunity was unable to be assessed.

VI. PHYSICIAN SERVICES – PROVIDERS
NCI employs a mission-based management methodology with the acronym “CARTS” to analyze the
multifaceted activity of an academic or teaching physician.

The CARTS analysis consolidates the requirements of CCHHS for all missions.
•

There are 106 FTE of excess providers.

•

It is important to note that the clinical requirement has already been enhanced by 30% to account for
inferior data quality.

requirements have been satisfied.
-7Page 26 of 67

 Additional comments and recommendations include:
CCHHS does not currently have the ability to monitor individual physician productivity.
• It is paramount that this be fixed.
Physician work expectations are not clearly delineated or matched with need:
• Physicians self-report 48.5% of their time as “teaching”, much greater than the need.
• Clinical activity is a much smaller expectation than required.
Resolve Human Resource issues to align with expectations.
• Delineate all expectations related to time and activity in each position description.
• Expand the salary range for faculty and physicians to allow for market competitive rates.
• Create ability to split 1.0 FTE positions into smaller increments.

VII. PHYSICIAN SERVICES – ACHN
Comments and recommendations relating to ACHN include:
The clinics run at about 59% efficiency based on the NCI flow optimization model.
There are significant process issues which inhibit effective staffing patterns and reduce the
productivity of physicians.

The support staffing analysis indicates significant variance between locations based on worked
hours per visit.
There is a need to enforce consistent use of established operating policies and procedures through
aggressive training, competency validation and performance monitoring.
Establish definitive functional skill set and adjust staffing mix accordingly.

IX. CLINICAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
Key findings and recommendations include:
The current model for each of the facilities would be described as a traditional Utilization Review and
Discharge Planning approach to case management.
Compliance/preventative measures, such as Medicare conditions for participation Recovery Audit
Contractors focus areas, are limited.
Limited data available and no case management dashboard/report card exists to evaluate the
impact of case management activities.
Develop written criteria to guide patient assignments based on changes in the patient condition that are
consistent across similar levels-of-care.
Develop a CCHHS Nursing Services Quality Dashboard monitoring standardized key nursing sensitive
metrics.

Additional resources are required to achieve effective staffing and impact average length of stay (ALOS)
at each hospital.

Cermak currently has 2.38 FTE dentist, and 3.0 dental assistants.
Cermak has been budgeted for 2 additional dentists and dental assistant positions, and they
are actively recruiting.
Filling these positions will place Cermak in a position to provide acute and restorative care to
detainees.
Even filling these positions will leave Cermak short of the target of 6.5 dentists at a
minimum.

 Labor Productivity – Premium Pay
Assessment
• CCHHS hospitals are well above the NCI overtime benchmark of 2% of total worked
hours.
• NCI recommends Agency Hours at the benchmark of 1% of total worked hours, but
there is not a comprehensive data source to track Agency hours, so the opportunity
was unable to be assessed.

Physician Services – Providers

NCI employs a mission-based management methodology with the acronym “CARTS” to
analyze the multifaceted activity of an academic or teaching physician.

The CARTS analysis consolidates the requirements of CCHHS for all missions.
•
•

There are 106 FTE of excess providers.
It is important to note that the clinical requirement has already been enhanced by 30% to account
for inferior data quality.

Additional comments and recommendations include:
CCHHS does not currently have the ability to monitor individual physician productivity
productivity.
• It is paramount that this be fixed.
Physician work expectations are not clearly delineated or matched with need:
• Physicians self-report 48.5% of their time as “teaching”, much greater than the need.
• Clinical activity is a much smaller expectation than required.
Resolve Human Resource issues to align with expectations.
• Delineate all expectations related to time and activity in each position description.

 Physician Services – ACHN
Comments and recommendations relating to ACHN include:
The clinics run at about 59% efficiency based on the NCI flow optimization model.
There are significant process issues which inhibit effective staffing patterns and reduce the
productivity of physicians.
The support staffing analysis indicates significant variance between locations based on worked
hours per visit.
There is a need to enforce consistent use of established operating policies and procedures through
aggressive training
training, competency validation and performance monitoring
monitoring.
Establish definitive functional skill set and adjust staffing mix accordingly.

Key findings and recommendations include:

The current model for each of the facilities would be described as a traditional Utilization Review and
Discharge Planning approach to case management.
Compliance/preventative measures, such as Medicare conditions for participation Recovery Audit
Contractors focus areas,, are limited.
Limited data available and no case management dashboard/report card exists to evaluate the
impact of case management activities.
Develop written criteria to guide patient assignments based on changes in the patient condition that are
consistent across similar levels-of-care.
Develop a CCHHS Nursing Services Quality Dashboard monitoring standardized key nursing sensitive
metrics.
