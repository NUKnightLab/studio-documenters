Additionally, the following staff and advisors were present: Sarah Boeckman, Attorney,

Ms. Ruffolo opened the meeting by giving an overview of the review of the provisional
ballots which resulted in the disqualification of two votes cast for candidate John
Sciaraffa. The results of the provisional ballot review were as follows:
Candidate
Jeff Johnson
Anthony Clancy
John Sciaraffa

Votes
207
203
191

Ms. Sarah Boeckman of Burke, Burns & Pinelli reviewed the research conducted with
respect to the use of the name “Jeff” as opposed to Jeffrey on Mr. Johnson’s Election
petitions and submitted paperwork. Based on previous case-law, it seems that this does
not rise to the level of utilizing a “nickname” with respect to the election.
Ms. Boeckman also reviewed the fiduciary responsibility of Mr. Johnson with respect to
his current litigation against the Fund and indicated that it does not preclude Mr. Johnson
from running for Trustee of the Fund.
There being no further issues to discuss, the meeting was adjourned at 9:01 a.m. on a
motion by Trustee Guest. Seconded by Trustee McMahon. Carried by a voice vote.
