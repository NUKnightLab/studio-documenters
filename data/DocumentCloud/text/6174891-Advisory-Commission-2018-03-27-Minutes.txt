Budget and Financial Report

i.
Balance Sheet looks healthy and typical for this time of year. Accounts payable of
$175,476 is a TIF Rbate that will be paid out over the next few years. Accounts
Payable of $531,297 includes all commited funds for 2018.
ii.
2018 Budget v. Actuals looks good and typical for this time of year. 2017 Audit
provided information that may warrant a Budget Amendment to increase
Budgeted Carry Over in 2018. Decorative Banner budget may warrant a Budget
Modification since most banners were printed in 2017.
iii.
6.08 Office Printing is over-budget when reported on a cash basis due to a
December 2017 expense being paid in January 2018.

  
5.

2018 Budget Amendment
a. Weidl presented an actual year-end balance based on the 2017 Audit. The year-end balance
may warrant an incerease in the 2018 Budgeted Carryover by $30,000. Staff recommends
that this $30,000 amount be allocated to 1.08 PR/Media Relations in order to fund a
PR/Media Relations consultant. A Budget Amendment would be required to increase the
2018 Budgeted Carryover amount.
i.
Tuohy asked if $30,000 is enough to fund a PR/Media Relations consultant.
ii.
Keeney thought that amount felt about right for services for the remainder of
2018.
iii.
Rettker said that the return on investment may be hard to track, and may not be
noticible for a few years after the services are provided.
iv.
Cheng recommended releasing an RFP and reviewing proposals during the April
24th 2018 meeting. Cheng also recommened waiting to vote on a Budget
Amendment until after proposals are reviewed.

 
6.

2018 Budget Modification
a. Weidl presented that the 1.05 Decorative Banner budget is higher than expenses are
anticipated to be. This is due to most banners being printed in 2017. Staff recommended a
2018 Budget Modification to move $30,000 of budgeted expenses out of 1.05 Decorative
banners into the following categories:
i.
Decrease 1.05 Decorative Banners by $30,000 from $72,022 to $42,022.
