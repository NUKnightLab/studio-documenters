CELEBRATING BLACK HISTORY MONTH
WHEREAS, Black History Month provides an opportunity for the residents of Cook County to recognize
the culture, history and talents of African Americans; and
WHEREAS, Black History Month began as "Negro History Week," which was created in 1926 by Carter
G. Woodson, a noted African American historian, scholar, educator, and publisher. It became a month-long
celebration in 1976. The month of February was chosen to coincide with the birthdays of Frederick
Douglass and Abraham Lincoln; and
WHEREAS, in 1976, President Gerald R. Ford officially recognized Black History Month, calling it a
moment for the public to "seize the opportunity to honor the too-often neglected accomplishments of black
Americans in every area of endeavor throughout our history." Since then, the month of February has been
recognized by every President of the United States as Black History Month; and
WHEREAS, the 2018 Black History Month theme is “African Americans in Times of War,” we honor the
African American men and women who have fought and laid down their lives for their country; and
WHEREAS, there have been many African American military units that have contributed to our nation’s
history included but not limited to the Civil War’s Buffalo Soldiers and World War II’s Tuskegee Airmen;
and
WHEREAS, this year marks the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I and honors the roles that
black Americans have played in warfare, from the American Revolution to today; and
WHEREAS, all residents of Cook County can draw strength and inspiration from the unwavering and
steadfast spirit displayed by African Americans in their fight against slavery, segregation, economic
oppression and injustice; and
WHEREAS, African Americans have made countless economic, social, cultural and political contributions
throughout Cook County, the State of Illinois, and the United States of America; and
WHEREAS, we must always pay tribute to all the heroes of African-American history, and it is important
that the people of Cook County observe Black History Month with the highest level of respect and regard.

 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County President and the Board of
Commissioners honor the numerous trailblazers of Black History, and recognize the many extraordinary
accomplishments African Americans have made to the United States of America, the State of Illinois, and
to Cook County.

IN MEMORY OF THE HONORABLE JUDGE WILLIAM COUSINS JR.
WHEREAS, William Cousins Jr, former Justice of the Illinois Appellate Court, Cook County Prosecutor,
trial attorney, Alderman of the 8th Ward, community leader and a man who spent his life deeply devoted
to faith, family and public service died January 20th at the age of 90. He left behind countless friends,
family and a community deeply enriched for having known him; and
WHEREAS, William Cousins was born a small Mississippi community within a stone’s throw of the place
where Emmett Till was killed. At an early age he confronted issues of racism and violence and was an eyewitness to many of the social pathologies and lack of opportunity associated with poverty. Neither of his
parents had much schooling but they were tireless in securing an education for their son. The family moved
to Memphis and later to Chicago in 1938. His exceptional academic talent revealed itself early in life; he
graduated from DuSable High School where he earned top grades, ran track, and served as president of his
senior class; and
WHEREAS, William Cousins received a bachelor’s degree in political science from the University of
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1948. While there, he excelled both academically and as a cadet in the
Reserve Officers' Training Corps. He starred on the school's debate team, never losing a debate. For his
bachelor's degree in political science, he wrote a thesis on stare decisis et non quieta movere--Latin for "to
adhere to precedent and not disturb settled principles." He concluded that adhering to precedent was
essential for a stable system of justice in a society, even though it meant that societal injustices would only
be corrected "with provoking slowness." Precedent need not be abandoned to make society more fair, he
wrote; instead, "the quality of our judges should be improved." Nearly three decades before he would
become one himself, Cousins wrote, "While judges are men, they must of necessity be more than ordinary
men;” and
WHEREAS, William Cousins received his law degree from Harvard Law School in 1951. After law
school, he was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Army and served in the Pacific Theater during the
Korean War. He was a second lieutenant in the infantry, where he was the leader of a predominately allwhite unit. While in Japan, he met his future wife, Hiroko Ogawa. The couple married in Japan in 1953
and raised four children and remained together until she died in 2005; and
WHEREAS, William Cousins began his legal career as an examining attorney for Chicago Title & Trust
Company. Later, he served as an assistant state’s attorney and then formed his own law firm along with
three other African-American attorneys and Harvard Law School graduates; and
WHEREAS, in 1967, William Cousins became alderman of the 8th Ward. He ran for alderman as an
independent Democrat, using the slogan “Unbowed, Unbossed and Unbought” and was elected three times.
While an alderman, his main contributions were the extension of rapid transit south. He opposed the
creation of the Crosstown Expressway and sought to add new schools and parks to the ward. He also fought
to keep open commuter rail stations on the Illinois Central at the 79th, 82nd and 87th Street stations. One
highlight of his ten years, was the citywide ordinance he sponsored that was approved by the council
establishing Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday as a city holiday; and

 WHEREAS, William Cousins left the City Council for the bench when he was elected to the Cook County
Circuit Court. While there, he was known for his exceptional work ethic, fairness and formality. From the
bench, he always referred to himself as “the court.” His rulings were long and detailed in order to forestall
reversals in higher courts. He will long be remembered for this relentless attention to detail which often
kept him late into the evening at the courthouse, a habit for which he became known as "The Prince of
Darkness"; and
WHEREAS, Judge Cousins was a jurist who was decades ahead of his time. While a sitting judge in
Circuit Court, he courageously challenged the constitutionality of Illinois' death penalty. In a case in which
the state sought the death penalty, he ruled that Illinois' Death Sentence Act was, in his words "wantonly
and freakishly imposed." Though his ruling was reversed by the Illinois Supreme Court it was often
described by many as courageous and compassionate. He was proud of his ruling that found Illinois’ death
penalty unconstitutional in 1979, over two (2) decades before then Governor George Ryan declared a
moratorium on capital punishment; and
WHEREAS, in 1992, William Cousins won the Democratic primary for a 10-year term as a justice on the
Illinois Appellate Court. He went on to win the general election with no opposition. Decades ahead of
others he publicly noted that the population of Illinois' prisons has almost doubled since he had joined the
bench, from 12,000 to more than 20,000 He often lamented the growing dependency on incarceration as
the cure for crime. He stated that "They are building new prisons, but not fast enough--they fill almost
before they complete them. Obviously, we're fighting a losing battle; "and
WHEREAS, Justice Cousins chose not to seek re-election to the appellate court in 2002. After he retired
from the bench he was requested by Mayor Richard M. Daley to co-chair a panel to investigate code
enforcement policies and possible communication breakdowns among city agencies in the wake of the E2
nightclub disaster that killed twenty-one people. He was later named to the panel, known as the Mikva
commission by Cook County Board President John Stroger to conduct an independent investigation into
the deadly fire at the Cook County Administration building; and
WHEREAS, in addition to his stellar legal career, William Cousins was also a well-respected volunteer
leader in the community. He led the Chatham-Avalon Park Community Council, where he worked to
oppose high-rise housing in the neighborhood and was an active member of Trinity United Church of Christ
and Kappa Alpha Psi and Sigma Pi Phi, his college fraternity where he participated in student sit-ins; and
WHEREAS, throughout his long exceptional life, Cousins faced prejudice and lost opportunities because
he was African-American; he fought back against racism as deliberately and methodically as he ruled in
court and the community has lost a great friend; he will be missed. He will be missed by his many friends,
neighbors and colleagues. His loss will be felt most acutely by his children Gail Yoshiko Cousins, Cheryl
Akiko Cousins; two (2) sons, Yul Cousins and Noel Cousins; and four (4) grandchildren.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County, on behalf
of the 5.2 million residents of Cook County who he served dutifully, commemorates the extraordinary life
of the Honorable Justice William Cousins Jr., and herewith expresses its sincere gratitude for the invaluable
and innumerable contributions he has made to the Citizens of Cook County, Illinois; and

 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a suitable copy of this Resolution be spread upon the official
proceedings of this Honorable Body and that an official copy of the same be tendered to the family of the
Honorable Justice William Cousins Jr.
