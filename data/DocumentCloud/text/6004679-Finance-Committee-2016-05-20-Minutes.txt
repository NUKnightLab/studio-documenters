Director Richardson-Lowry, seconded by Director Butler, moved to accept the
minutes of the Finance Committee Meeting of April 22, 2016. THE MOTION

Charles Jones, Director of Strategic Sourcing and Supply Chain Management, provided an overview of the requests
presented for the Committee’s consideration.
Mr. Jones provided information in response to a question regarding those contracts that are approved pending review
by Contract Compliance. He stated that those contracts do not move forward until they are found to be responsive to
the County’s Ordinance regarding minority and women-owned business enterprise goals. For those contracts approved
as pending review by Contract Compliance, the Board Secretary will not provide the stamped Board approval for
processing and execution of the contract until the letter from Contract Compliance is received confirming the vendor’s
responsiveness to the County’s Ordinance.
With regard to request number 6, Mr. Jones stated that this is a sole source contract because this vendor is the only
U.S.–based distributor of this particular product.

Action Items
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)
With regard to request number 8, it was noted that the request is to extend the contract for two (2) months, not twelve
(12) months. A correction will be made to the transmittal. During the discussion of the request, Director RichardsonLowry inquired regarding the diversity of the group of legal service providers used by the System. Jeff McCutchan,
Interim General Counsel, responded that the contracts for those services all go through Contract Compliance. The
administration tends to go through outside counsel for specialized types of services; frequently, there is a very limited
number of firms to choose between, but diversity is absolutely one of the criteria used when identifying those who are
available with that expertise. Director Richardson-Lowry requested that Mr. McCutchan provide through the Chair the
current list of law firms used.
With regard to request number 9, it was noted that this request to amend, increase and extend the contract is solely for
the provision of food and nutrition services; it does not include the provision of transportation services and
management of Environmental Services after June 30, 2016.
With regard to request number 13, Mr. Jones stated that this is a sole source contract because the vendor is the only one
that has that technology available for patients with varying hemoglobin sickle cell traits.
With regard to request number 14, Mr. Jones stated that this is a sole source contract because this vendor is the
manufacturer and sole distributor of this product.
Director Wiese stated that it would be helpful if the requests included the number of units being procured. Chairman
Estrada responded that this information can be included.
Director Butler, seconded by Director Richardson-Lowry, moved the approval of
request numbers 1 through 18, subject to completion of review by Contract
Compliance, where appropriate. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

C. Any items listed under Section IV and V

VI. Report from the Chief Financial Officer (Attachment #3)
A. Metrics
B. Financial Statements through April 2016
C. Report of emergency purchases
Ekerete Akpan, Chief Financial Officer, reviewed the presentation that included information on Metrics and
Financial Statements through April 2016. The Committee discussed the information.
During the review of the Income Statement, Mr. Akpan indicated that the variance reflected at the bottom is the
result of rounding. Director Richardson-Lowry responded that, in that instance, because it rounds out in a way
that appears as if it does not equate, it might be useful to be more precise in the percentages. Director Wiese
requested that the expense described as “Purchased Services, Rental/Other” be broken out to be more
explanatory.

VI.

Report from the Chief Financial Officer (continued)
With regard to the information regarding overtime on slide 9, Director Richardson-Lowry inquired regarding
the basis for the 5% goal. Douglas Elwell, Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Finance and Strategy, stated that
the budget target is set at 3%; 5% is over industry standards, but is aggressive for CCHHS.
There were no emergency purchases to report at this time.

VII. Adjourn
As the agenda was exhausted, Chairman Estrada declared the meeting ADJOURNED.

– Analytics, engagement and care coordination
• Care Coordination
– To support participation in an organized
approach to their care that reflects their
priorities and best practice. Long term goal is
to make them self-sufficient to manage their
conditions

 Care Coordination Historical Approach
• Physicians care manage cases-give patients their
pager #s
• Care management visits at ACHN for chronic
disease teaching, status checks etc.
• Departments may have obtained resources to
support navigation for their patients
• CORE center activities supported by grant funds
• Home IV antibiotics and home care in lieu of
facility placement for selected populations
Strategic Planning May 20, 2016

6

 CountyCare Transition
• Assumed responsibility for Care Coordination for
enrollees assigned to ACHN, Access and 16 FQHCs
medical homes (approx. 81,000 members)
• Diverse care coordination population served
includes high risk, waiver, transplants, behavioral
health, discharges from the hospital, nursing
facility residents, pregnant patients
• Diverse settings-home, health centers, hospitals,
nursing facilities
Strategic Planning May 20, 2016

 Transitioning Care Coordination
Increase # of new cases
through outreach,
screening and analytics

Close cases inherited
from Centene
• No longer eligible
• Risk status has
decreased
• Case goals met

Strategic Planning May 20, 2016

Preventive Services
Compliance with guidelines for chronic conditions
Resource utilization shift
Engagement and self-sufficiency

• Engage physicians and medical home teams

– Care coordination viewed as beneficial
– Access to providers for care plan development
– Mechanisms for data sharing and program enhancement

• Improve patient satisfaction

– Care Coordination is a reason for a member to bond to
system or CountyCare
Strategic Planning May 20, 2016

 Current Care Coordination Approach
Centralized management-local deployment
Intensive training due to role complexity
Team approach
Mobile technology-phones, tablets, hot spots
Clinical supervision-joint visits, chart review
Care management system with significant
interfaces
• All “hands-on-deck”

eligibility processes
• Cultural awareness
• Comprehensive knowledge of inpatient, outpatient and social
services

Strategic Planning May 20, 2016

11

 Impact on CCHHS
• Requires and receives major support from many
departments-IT, HR, ACHN, Medical Leadership,
CountyCare
• Measured Diffusion into CCHHS operations
– Screening-at touchpoints (ACHN visits, welcome calls,
ED visits, returning care coordination calls, inpatients)
– Integration of Care Teams into ACHN sites

• Creation of additional phone queue to field care
coordination calls
Strategic Planning May 20, 2016

12

 April Results

– PSC received approximately 4,600 care
coordination calls (in addition to their regular
calls)

• Completed Screenings-736
– As expected significant # are high risk
– Behavioral Health Assessment 171

• Members touched-1,018
• Home visits completed 131
Strategic Planning May 20, 2016

13

 Addressing Social Determinants

determinants. Issues identified will addressed
by social worker and team
• Needs addressed via “Purple Binder”
– Food (171)
– Housing (153)
– Clothing (118)
– Substance abuse treatment (35)

Strategic Planning May 20, 2016

14

 Impressions

disease burden– Prevalence of mental health issues may be related
to the disease burden-but still requires a
strategy/intervention

• Seemingly unlimited ability to impact
• Have a window into medical home
performance
Strategic Planning May 20, 2016
