 GENERAL BACKGROUND
The purpose of the Jobs Plus Pilot program is to develop locally-based, job driven approaches to
increase earnings and advance employment outcomes through work readiness, employer linkages,
job placement, educational advancement technology skills, and financial literacy for residents of
public housing. The place-based Jobs Plus Pilot program addresses poverty among public housing
residents by incentivizing and enabling employment through income disregards for working
families, and a set of services designed to support work including employer linkages, job placement
and counseling, educational advancement, and financial counseling.
CHA has identified a Core Group, an Advisory Board and support partners for the implementation
of the CHA Jobs Plus Pilot program at Altgeld Gardens. The Core Group consists of CHA, the Chicago
Cook Workforce Partnership (CCWP) and the FamilyWorks provider at Altgeld Gardens,
Metropolitan Family Services (MFS). CHA will assume the lead, while CCWP will oversee employer
and industry relations. MFS will assume the daily, on the ground program implementation. The
Jobs Plus Advisory Board will consist of the Core Group members, as well as the industry partners,
Local Advisory Council and the community coaches. The Advisory Board will provide input into
program operations and facilitate sub-groups necessary to address specific issues and
sustainability of the Jobs Plus program and will utilize the support partners and other local
resources for input on specific needs and requirements as the Jobs Plus program moves through
the implementation phase and into a sustainable community program.
CHA has chosen to focus a significant portion of Jobs Plus program implementation on the
manufacturing and hospitality sectors. Both these industries have ample growth opportunity in the
communities immediately surrounding Altgeld Gardens and will see significant growth throughout
the Chicagoland area in the near future. CCWP will utilize its existing relationships with the Calumet
Area Industrial Commission (CAIC) and Educational Data Systems, Inc. (EDSI) who will serve as
industry specific partners to develop customized training for the target manufacturing and
hospitality industries. Program design components consist of:
Employment-Related Services
 MFS will conduct outreach, engagement and retention activities
 MFS will offer a comprehensive menu of available employment and workforce
development resources such as Job readiness training, workforce preparation workshops,
networking events, job clubs, education and literacy services, computer/technology
resources, business and employer partners, and as available, subsidized transitional job
and on-the-job training programs.
 MFS will facilitate additional workforce and employments supports such as assessing
participants’ eligibility for income supports and benefits (e.g. Earned Income Tax Credit)
and facilitate twice monthly Job Club activities.
 Additional supports include utilizing the Test of Adult Basic Education (TABE) testing and
education action planning. MFS staff will assist participants with limited literacy skills and
limited education (GED preparation) by identifying specific education goals and action
steps that will lead to larger, more long-term planning.

literacy training and other supports as needed.
