Rebate / Grant Updates:

➢
Façade Rebate Applications: Kace made pending changes to the application with
new language from last month’s discussion about limiting property owners to apply more than
5 years a part. Commission was concerned about CDT’s applications which wouldn’t allow
new tenants to receive any future funds. Language edited and discussed again to allow for
business owners to apply for funds even if property owner was already approved funds, as
well as if the property had a business turnover. Façade Application to be updated with new

 pending language: “Same applicant per property”, and add line saying that it is “Per discretion
of the SSA Commission.”
*Sara Dulkin motioned to approve the edits to the Façade Rebate Application. Adam
Williams seconded this motion and it was approved unanimously.
