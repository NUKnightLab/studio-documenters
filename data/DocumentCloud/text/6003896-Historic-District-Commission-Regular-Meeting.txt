 REPORT

APPENDIX

HDC : BRUSH PARK ELEMENTS OF DESIGN
Reference: ​ 112 Edmund Place and 2827 John R Street

Date: June 13, 2018

(1) Height. ​Height varies in the district from one (1) to eleven (11) stories. In the area between Woodward

and Brush, the original development was almost exclusively two and one-half (2 1/2) story houses. Later
changes included the construction of apartment buildings among the houses, the majority of which are
three (3) stories in height. The tallest building, the former Detroiter Hotel, is located on Woodward Avenue
in the commercial strip. All other buildings more than four (4) stories in height are located between
Woodward and John R., and generally on or immediately adjacent to buildings on those streets. East of
Brush, the original development ranged from one (1) to two and one-half (2 1/2) stories. Later
redevelopment includes apartment buildings not more than four (4) stories tall, most often located on
Brush. In the case of the nineteenth century houses located between Woodward and Brush, the two and
one-half (2 1/2) story height implies more height in feet than usual, since ceiling heights in these houses
are unusually high.
112 EDMUND
● On John R Street, story height is six (6) with a seventh (7​th​) story set back. Ultimate height of
building at setback portion is 80’ which is lower than the height of the Carlton Lofts (formally
Plaza Hotel) building (92’) on the next block north and the John R Apartments (95’) to the south.
● On Edmund Place, story height is six (6) with a seventh (7​th​) story set back.
● On Alley, story height is six with a seventh story set back.
● Along the historic Lucien Moore Estate, story height is six (6) with a seventh (7​th​) story set back.
The soffit height of 112 is raised three stories to allow for views of the historic home.
2827 JOHN R
● On John R, the existing, adaptively reused one-story building sets the street edge. This new
portion is setback from it and rises to forty-eight feet to parapet. The roof access stairs are set
back another thirty-eight feet from the new portions leading edge on John R. Stair enclosures and
an additional nine feet in height.
● On Alfred Street, the stair turret steps down an additional nine feet eight inches towards the
historic JL Hudson Home. The townhouse mixed-use building steps down an additional nine feet
towards the JL Hudson Home. Building is forty-eight feet tall to roof high point.
● On Alley, the existing, adaptively reused Carriage House is coincident with the property line and is
the furthest projection. The new portion rises out of the Carriage House’s long-ago demolished
roof and is forty-eight feet tall. There is a twenty-four foot gap and connecting corridor of
thirty-seven feet between Carriage House building and new townhouse mixed-use building. The

 ●

mixed-use building’s circulation core rises to fifty-feet and the parking structure portion steps
down an additional nine feet towards the JL Hudson Home.
Along the historic JL Hudson Home, the leading edge of the townhouses building roof mass is
thirty-seven feet and is lower than aforementioned JL House. At thirty-eight feet from Alfred, the
building steps up seven foot six inches in height. That portions steps down four feet about
sixty-feet from the Alley.

(2) Proportion of building's front facade. ​Buildings in the district are usually taller than wide; horizontal
proportions exist only in incompatible later buildings, except for row house buildings.

112 EDMUND
● On John R Street, 112’s side is longer than it is tall. However, grouping of tall windows and
balconies provide a secondary vertical reading.
● 112’s front façade mass on Edmund Place has a vertical read. 112 is taller than it is wide at
sixty-three foot six inches and seventy-one feet tall. If the seventh (7​th​) story set back is
considered, the reading is even more vertical.
● On the Alley, the mass reading is similar to Edmund Place’s with an ultimate width of seventy foot
six and a height of eighty-three feet.
● Along the historic Lucien Moore Estate, the reading is longer than it is tall. But, like the John R
elevations, grouping of tall windows and balconies soften the horizontal reading.
2827 JOHN R
● On John R, 2827’s front façade is longer than it is wide. However, this horizontal read is softened
by vertical exposed columns at twenty-eight feet on center. Creating further ‘depth’ is a
secondary reading of tall windows and window mullions.
● On Alfred Street, 2827 Headhouse is essentially square at forty-seven feet wide and forty-eight
feet tall. However, like the elevation on John R, tall windows and exposed columns convey
verticality. The expressed stair turret and elevator core are vertical elements. Floor to ceiling
windows on the townhouse building help express verticality, as well.
● On Alley, similar to the Lucien Moore Estate Place elevation, building elements are broken down
into function. However, the reading is horizontal with a secondary reading of vertical thru the
expression of the circulation elements and tall window proportions.
● Along the historic JL Hudson Home, the townhouses mass have a vertical proportion with an
additional masonry vertically proportioned mass next to it that is twenty-seven feet wide and
thirty-seven feet tall. The remainder of the building mass is comprised of a vertical wood scrim.

(3) Proportion of openings within the facade. ​Areas of void generally constitute between fifteen (15)

percent and thirty-five (35) percent of the total facade area, excluding roof. Proportions of the openings
themselves are generally taller than wide; in some cases, vertically proportioned units are combined to fill
an opening wider than tall.
112 EDMUND
● On John R, as the ground level portion is the retail and residential entry, it is a very ‘open’ facade.
By percentage it is approximate 40% open. The second level which is a commercial office
program, its openness is 85%. The third level which is also commercial office, its openness is 50%.

 Proportion of all fenestration is taller than it is wide and is a vertical reading. Levels four through
seven which is a residential program embody a facade that is 30% open. All window openings are
taller than they are wide. This is true of all facades except the facade facing the historic Lucien
Moore Estate. The facade on all levels of that face is 25% open.
2827 JOHN R
● On John R, the Carriage House masonry openings are existing and remain unchanged. The
masonry openings in the 1920-40s low building will be enlarged to be more vertical. The new
portion of the building above the existing will be generally opening and transparent.
● On Alfred Street, the masonry openings in the 1920-40s low building will be enlarged to be more
vertical. The new portion of the building above the existing will be generally opening and
transparent. The windows on the townhouse building are vertically orientated.
● On Alley, the Carriage House masonry openings are existing and remain unchanged. The parking
structure exterior envelope is a vertically oriented blackened wood plank.
● Along Historic Home, the parking structure exterior envelope is a vertically oriented blackened
wood plank. The windows closest to Alfred Street are of a taller proportion.

(4) Rhythm of solids to voids in front facade. ​Victorian structures in the district often display great
freedom in the placement of openings in the facades, although older examples are generally more regular
in such placement than later examples. In later apartments, openings tend to be very regular.
112 EDMUND
● On John R, the window patterning is regular. However, larger windows and balconies are
strategically placed in asymmetric pattern against the regular window grid.
● On Edmund Place, the windowing patterning is regular.
● On Alley, the windowing patterning is regular.
● Along Historic Home, the windowing patterning is regular on the upper portion above the ground
level. The ground level’s windows are staggered in a composed spacing.
2827 JOHN R
● On John R, the Carriage House masonry openings are existing and remain unchanged and are
inherently placed to respond to original program elements. The masonry openings in the
1920-40s low building will be enlarged to be more vertical and remain statically placed. The new
portion of the building above the existing will be curtainwall with a composed asymmetric spaced
screens.
● On Alfred Street, the masonry openings in the 1920-40s low building will be enlarged but remain
regularly spaced. The new portion of the building above the existing will be generally open and
transparent. The windows on the townhouse building are again composed for asymmetric
reading. The new portion of the building above the existing will be curtainwall with staggered
spaced screening elements.
● On Alley, the parking structure exterior envelope is regularly spaced blackened wood plank.
● Along Historic Home, the parking structure exterior envelope is a vertically oriented blackened
wood plank. The windows closest to Alfred Street are placed on a 4 foot grid, composed in
asymmetric fashion.

(5) Rhythm of spacing of buildings on streets. ​The area between Woodward and Brush appears to have
been developed in a very regular spacing, with fifty (50) foot lots. This regularity has been disrupted by the
demolition of many of the houses, and the vacant land resulting, as well as the occasional combination of
lots for larger structures, particularly close to Woodward. East of Brush, smaller lots were used in

 subdividing, but many buildings stand on more land than one lot, and the parcel sizes are now quite
irregular, as is the placement of buildings.
112 EDMUND
● On John R, it is one lot and the building essentially occupies the full frontage of John R.
● On Edmund Place, the new building occupies 80% of its lot and is 35’ from the closest projection
(bay window) of its historic neighbor the Lucien Moore Estate.
● On Alley, the new building occupies 80% of its lot and is 25.5’ from the closest projection of a
2-story aluminum siding clad structure of unknown recent construction.
2827 JOHN R
● On John R, existing street rhythm is maintained as new portion of the building is a vertical
expansion.
● On Alfred Street, existing rhythm is partially maintain as noted above. The mixed-use townhouses
parking center maintains approximately a seventy-five foot space to the JL Hudson Estate similar
to previous buildings onsite.
● On Alley, existing carriage House vertical new portion (like John R) and mixed-use with same
setback as Alfred Street.

(6) Rhythm of entrance and/or porch projections. ​Most buildings have or had a porch or entrance
projection. The variety inherent in Victorian design precludes the establishment of any absolute rhythm,
but such projections were often centered. On Woodward, the commercial nature of most buildings and
the widening of Woodward has effectively eliminated such projections.
112 EDMUND
● On John R, the retail space entrances are to be determined as far as exact location. But,
entrances will be integral with framing material.
● On Edmund Place, the residential entry is set back to align with the Lucien Moore Estate.
2827 JOHN R
● On John R, entries occur in the existing brick walls of the one-story piece and the Carriage House
and are devoid of the context of an existing, historical building.
● On Alfred Street, where adjacent to the existing, historical JL Hudson home, the townhouse
entries are set back from the street.
● On Alley, entry to the residential program is set back from the street edge.

(7) Relationship of materials. ​By far the most prevalent material in the district is common brick; other

forms of brick, stone and wood trim are common; wood is used as a structural material only east of Brush.
Some later buildings have stucco wall surfaces. Originally, roofs were wood or slate with an occasional
example of tile; asphalt replacement roofs are common.
112 EDMUND
● On John R, a brick base with ornate detailing is provided.
● On Edmund Place, a brick base with ornate detailing is provided.
● On Alley, a brick base with ornate detailing is provided.
● Along Historic Home, a brick base with ornate detailing is provided.that extends to the height and
width of The Lucien Moore Estate.

●

On John R, the existing Carriage House and one-story portion with brick will be cleaned, repaired
and repointed as necessary.
On Alfred Street, the existing one-story portion’s brick will be cleaned, repaired and repointed as
necessary. The new townhouses facade will be of masonry.
On Alley, the existing Carriage House and one-story pieces’ brick will be cleaned, repaired and
repointed as necessary,
Along Historic Home, the parking structure will have a brick base.

(8) Relationship of textures​. The most common relationship of textures in the district is the low-relief

pattern of mortar joints in brick contrasted to the smoother or rougher surfaces of stone or wood trim.
Slate, wood, or tile roofs contribute particular textural values where they exist, especially in the case of
slates or shingles of other than rectangular shape.
112 EDMUND
● On John R, Edmund Place, alley and along the historic home, the brick base of the building
contrasts with the smoother texture of the cementitious siding above and with the metal accents.
2827 JOHN R
● On John R, Alfred Place and Alley the existing Carriage House and one-story pieces’ brick with
high relief will be cleaned, repaired and repointed as necessary. This brick will contrast with the
new glass, metal and concrete portion above.
● On Alfred Street, the mixed-use building mixes brick, precast, metal and glass for contrast.
● Along Historic Home, brick is mixed with a wood scrim and precast.

(9) Relationship of colors. ​Brick red predominates, both in the form of natural color brick and in the form of

painted brick. Other natural brick and stone colors are also present. These relate to painted woodwork in
various colors, and there is an occasional example of stained woodwork. Roofs of other than asphalt are
in natural colors; older slate roofs are often laid in patterns with various colors of slate. Original color
schemes for any given building may be determined by professional analysis of the paint layers on the
building, and when so determined are always appropriate for that building.
112 EDMUND
● The new building’s deep colored brick base contrasts sharply with the color of the cementitious
light colored panel of the building above.
2827 JOHN R
● The new vertical building portion rising out of the existing Carriage House and one-story piece is
concrete, zinc panel and glass and contrasts sharply, as well. The mixed-use building also uses
deeply colored brick. This contrasts with the precast accents and wood scrim.

(10) Relationship of architectural detail. ​On the buildings of the Victorian period, elaborate detail in

wood, stone, or sheet metal was common; areas treated include porches, window and door surrounds,
cornices, dormers, and other areas. Later buildings are generally simpler, but include less elaborate detail
in similar areas.
112 EDMUND
● The brick base of 112 will have a simple raised detail (relief) that repeats across all four faces of
the facade. The lower portion of the brick base at the pedestrian level will have a more ornate

 and complex relief pattern.
2827 JOHN R
● The existing Carriage House and One-story buildings’ brick detail will be repaired and restored to
what has been ascertained to be the condition prior to some recent partial collapse. The new
portion of the building will be built to stand in a more minimal, contrasting, contemporary style.

(11) Relationship of roof shapes. ​Examples of many roof shapes, including pitched gable roofs, hip roofs,

mansard roofs, and gambrel roofs are present. Different types are sometimes combined in a single
structure, and tower roofs, cupolas, lanterns, belvederes, monitors, conical roofs are used on various
Victorian houses. Flat roof areas in the center of hip or mansard roofs are frequent. Later apartment and
commercial buildings generally have flat roofs not visible from the ground. The generally tall roofs add
height to the houses of the Victorian period.
112 EDMUND
● The new building has a flat roof. However, the uppermost story is stepped back and angled in
plan giving the appearance when viewed from street level of an angled or mansard roof shape.
2827 JOHN R
● The gabled form of the existing Carriage House will be maintained on the facade and the new
buildings’ flat roof will stand in contrast to it.

​(12) Walls of continuity. ​Between Woodward and Brush, the houses originally honored common setbacks
which provided for front lawns. Some of the later apartments have not been set back to the same line as
the houses amongst which they were built, thus disturbing the original line of continuity. On Woodward,
the commercial development is typically at the sidewalk, creating a wall of continuity; this is not entirely
continuous due to parking lots and some buildings set well back. On John R. and Brush, and east of Brush,
buildings are typically placed at or near the sidewalk with little or no front yard. Where buildings are
continuous, a wall of continuity is created.
112 EDMUND
● The residential entry is set back to align with the front porch of the Lucien Moore Estate with the
lowest portion of the brick base set back from the property line.
2827 JOHN R
● On John R, entries occur in the existing brick walls of the one-story piece and the Carriage House
and are devoid of a the context of an existing, historical building.
● On Alfred Street, where adjacent to the existing, historical JL Hudson home, the townhouse
entries are set back from the street.
● On Alley, entry to the residential program is set back from the street edge.

(13) Relationship of significant landscape features and surface treatments. ​The major landscape

feature of the district is the vacant land, which creates a feeling that buildings are missing in the district.
Some houses have more than the standard fifty (50) foot lot, and have wide side yards. Individual houses
have front lawns often subdivided by walks leading to the entrance; lawns are exceedingly shallow or
non-existent in the area between Beaubien Street and Brush Street. Side drives are rare, access to garages
or coach houses being from the alleys. The closing of Watson and Edmund Place between John R. and
Brush has created landscaped malls uncharacteristic to the district. Some walks of stone slabs have

 survived; others have been replaced in concrete. Sidewalks are characteristically close to the curb.
112 EDMUND
● The new building occupied maximum eighty-percent of the site, creates an appropriate urban
corner and is set thirty-five feet off the side of Lucien Moore’s closest projection.
2827 JOHN R
● The new portion of the building occupies the existing footprint of The Carriage House creating an
urban corner and outdoor dining opportunity. The mixed-use building is set seventy-five feet
from the JL Hudson House.

(14) Relationship of open space to structures. ​There is a large quantity of open space in the area, due to

demolition of buildings. The character of this open space is haphazard as it relates to buildings, and
indicates the unplanned nature of demolitions due to decline. The feeling created is that buildings are
missing and should be present. On Watson and Edmund between John R. and Brush, the streets have been
removed and replaced with landscaped malls. The traditional relationship of houses to street has thus
become a relationship between houses and landscaped strip open space.
112 EDMUND
● The building fills in a critical, currently vacant urban corner visually stitching together the historic
Lucien Moore Estate to the West with the Carriage House to the South creating Place.
● With a building across the street (currently under construction) at a similar height and scale as
the proposed 112 Edmund, the “vacant” and “missing building” feel at the existing 112 site
would only be amplified without development. The mass of the proposed building relates to the
scale of the existing adjacent structures and this new building as well.
2827 JOHN R
● On John R Street, the 4-story building fills a gap in the street wall of the John R Street Corridor,
while maintaining a portion of open space on the site (outdoor dining terrace) which allows the
Ransom Gillis house to maintain its prominent visibility at the intersection of Alfred and John R.
This open space maintains the quality of the neighborhood where historic homes can be seen
from afar, while giving active program to the open space so that it does not feel as though a
building is missing.
● On Alfred Street, a larger setback is necessary as the townhomes extend down a residential street
and relate to the existing historic homes on the block. This setback allows the feeling of open
space between the street and the homes to be cohesive with the neighborhood. The 45 feet
between the townhomes and the existing JL Hudson House is also of the magnitude of dimension
found in the neighborhood with regard to spacing between homes.

(15) Scale of facades and facade elements. ​In the large houses between John R. and Brush, the scale

tends to be large, and the facade elements scaled and disposed to emphasize the large size of the houses.
Towers, setbacks, porches and the like divide facades into large elements. On Woodward, the scale ranges
from very large, and emphasized by many small window openings, as in the former Detroiter Hotel, and
very large, made up of large architectonic elements, such as the churches, down to quite small, with large
windows emphasizing the small size, as in some commercial fronts. East of Brush, the scale is smaller and
the detail less elaborate, creating a more intimate setting with the buildings closer to the street. Later
apartments are large in scale with simple but large elements near the ground and repetitive window
openings above, frequently capped by a substantial cornice.

 112 EDMUND
● On John R, the proposed building is in-line with the contextual note that “later apartments are
large in scale with simple but large elements near the ground and repetitive window openings
above” The scale of the facade is of the magnitude of the John R apartments to the South and
the Carlton Lofts to the North. The window patterning of the proposed building also relates to
these existing buildings and the regular, simple, alignment of window openings within the facade.
The facade consists of one larger scale facade broken down by many regularly spaced window
openings within the facade, consistent with buildings of this program type on the John R corridor.
● On Edmund Place, the scale of the facade is more narrow and vertical to be more consistent with
the scale of the facades that exist on Edmund Place. The facade maintains its regular patterning
of window openings and is subtracted from and made less solid with a glass wall as the building
touches the ground, which provides relief of the mass from the street edge and the existing
Lucien Moore Estate. The expression of the columns and the ornate brick soffit band at the
ground level give the sense of “simple but large elements near the ground”. The scale of the
facade on John R stitches together the scale of the John R corridor (large, multi-family) and the
scale of Edmund Place (medium, single-family) by breaking down the facade into smaller
elements as the building turns the corner on Edmund Place.
● On Alley, the building is more vertical and service doors to the building and its service spaces such
as mechanical, and trash rooms are located on this facade. Above, window patterning remains
regular within the larger facade.
● Along Historic Home, the window patterning of the proposed building is regular and of a spacing
familiar to residential buildings in the neighborhood. The Western facade is accented with brick
material where it sits behind the Lucien Moore Estate. The mass of the building is lifted and cut
away near the entry to allow more open views from the front yard of the historic home. The
location of the entry on Edmund Place is also intentional to create continuity of residential entry
within the facades along Edmund Place, mimicking the original entry location of the historic home
that once occupied the site.
2827 JOHN R
● On John R, the residential facade is divided into large elements expressive of the bounds of each
unit within the building. The facade is divided and ordered by the exposed columns which come
to the ground within the restaurant. Upward acting glass doors replace glass block in the existing
facade. Aside from this replacement of glass, the existing condition of the first level facade is
maintained.
● On Alfred Street, the scale of the facade is smaller than the other homes on the street. Large
vertical subtractions in its mass give it a rhythm that relates to the vertical elements of the
facades of the existing homes. The height of the facade of the townhomes is also below the
height of other buildings on the street, but of a similar height to allow for continuity on the
street. The stair at the Eastern edge of the elevation provides a vertical element that is a modern
interpretation on the tourette. The exposed band that traces the perimeter of the facade makes
the expressive gesture of the more classical cornice element.
● On Alley, the natural wood and green screen materials turn the corner from the JL Hudson home
onto the alley to bring a more pleasant materiality to one of the oldest brick alleys of Brush Park.
● Along Historic Home (79 Alfred Street), the facade is faced with brick and wood. The brick
captures the side of the Western townhome in a material consistent with the adjacent JL Hudson
home. The wood screen that runs along the length of the facade is broken down by areas of a
vegetative green screen wall. The natural materials that make up this facade allow the building
to blend in with the lush, heavily planted side yard of the existing JL Hudson home. The browns,
reds and greens maintain the natural feel that is already present on the JL Hudson property.

 (16) Directional expression of front facades. ​A substantial majority of the buildings in the district have

front facades vertically expressed. Exceptions are some commercial buildings on Woodward, row houses
on John R. or Brush, and some duplexes or row houses east of Brush.
112 EDMUND
● On John R, The facade is more horizontal with vertical expression of columns and windows, which
break down the scale of the building in the vertical direction. The setback of the facade at the
highest level of the building lessens the impact of the height on the street level environment
around the building.
● On Edmund Place, the building has a more vertical directional expression that relates to homes
along the street. The sloped soffit from level 2 to 3 exacerbates the directional rising-up gesture
of the facade.
● On the Alley, the building is slightly wider than, but treated similarly to, the facade on Edmund
Place. An additional element of verticality is created by a subtle material change in the vertical
direction to help break up the building’s width.
● Along Historic Home, the facade is characterized by regular window openings and brick facade
material that aligns with the perimeter of the elevational area of the Lucien Moore home. The
windows give some vertical direction to the facade, but otherwise the facade does not have a
directional orientation.
2827 JOHN R
● On John R, similar to 112 Edmund, the building has an overall horizontal orientation that is
balanced by vertical elements such as expressed columns and curtain wall mullions.
● On Alfred Street, the homes, although a continuous structure, are divided into vertically oriented
forms by large vertical voids in the elevation which allow for occupiable roof terraces. The voided
terraces provide a familiar residential rhythm to the street.
● Along Historic Home, The length of the horizontal facade is broken into vertically oriented
stretches of different natural materials. The intended growth of climbing plants on the green
screen system will also give a dynamic verticality to this facade. The wood screen elements are
also vertically oriented to balance out the overall horizontal orientation of the facade.
● On the Alley, the facade is treated very similarly to the Western facade along the historic home.
Vertically oriented screening elements and climbing plants give direction to the facade. The new
portion of the building above the carriage house also gives an upward sense to the street level
environment as the light and glass rising out of the existing structure draws the eye upward.

(17) Rhythm of building setbacks​. Buildings on the north-south streets generally have little or no setback,

while older houses on the east-west streets between Woodward and Brush have some setback, which
varies from street to street, though generally consistent in any one block. Later apartments and
commercial structures in that area often ignore the previously established setback. Between Brush and
Beaubien, setback is generally very limited, only a few feet, if any, lawn space being provided between
sidewalk and building.
112 EDMUND
● On John R, being a North-South street, the building has no setback at levels 2-6, consistent with
this element of design and other buildings on the John R corridor. The ground level is fronted by
a folded plane of brick and storefront that is setback of 4 - 8 feet to provide more of a pedestrian

 ●

●
●

space that is shared by tables, chairs and bike racks associated with the retail spaces within the
building.
On Edmund Place, the building is set back more dramatically at the building entrance in order to
relate to the setback entrances of homes on Edmund Place. As the elements of design notes,
“older houses on east-west streets have some setback, which varies from street to street, though
generally consistent in any one block” - the setback entrance at 112 is positioned to that end.
On the Alley, the building is setback slightly at the ground level to provide some space for tables
and chairs associated with the retail space. At levels 2-6, there is no setback on the alley,
consistent with the setback of the existing carriage house across the alley.
Along Historic Home, the building is setback 11 feet from the property line and positioned 35 feet
from the face of the bay window on the Eastern side of the home. The glass at levels 2-3 is
setback an additional foot and its lightness and transparency provides relief for views to and from
the home. The building is also set back at the top level (as it is on all sides).

2827 JOHN R
● On John R, the building is not set back from the street, consistent with other buildings along the
John R Street corridor. There is a setback by way of a terrace all along the second level which
provides relief of the new building from the ground level existing buildings. This set-back helps to
highlight the existing structure and allows for a softened interface between old and new.
● On Alfred Street, the townhomes are set back from the street to provide a landscaped area in
front of each, relating to the front yards of homes along Alfred. Entrances are set back further
yet to provide a porch that is within the character of typical residential entrances along Alfred as
well. These set-back porches are an important characteristic of the residential structures on
Alfred.
● On the Alley, The building is not set back from the street, consistent with the adjacent carriage
house structure.
● Along the JL Hudson home, the face of the wood and vegetative screen is 45 feet from the
Eastern face of the existing home. The front porch of the Western-most townhome opens up to
the heavily planted side yard of the existing home, providing increased site lines to and from the
existing JL Hudson home

(18) Relationship of lot coverage. ​Older single family houses between Woodward and Brush generally

occupy about twenty-five (25) to thirty (30) percent of the building lot, not including coach houses or
garages. Later apartments and commercial buildings often fill a much higher percentage of the lot,
sometimes approaching or reaching complete lot coverage. Between Brush and Beaubien, lot coverage for
residential structures is generally about forty (40) percent, with commercial and later apartment buildings
again occupying larger percentage of their lots.
112 EDMUND
● 112 will be similar to the later apartments buildings’ lot coverage with the coverage
approximately eighty-percent. The new building holds the street edge along John R with the open
space strategically placed between the new building and the Lucien Moore Estate adding relief
between the two. The ground floor and levels two and three are pulled back from the street to
allow additional space and ‘air’ between the two buildings. The focus on the actual perceived
space of the passerby and occupant of the new construction’s figure-ground is what drove this
design decision.

 2827 JOHN R
● The addition will rise out of the existing, restored Carriage House and One-story buildings’ walls
and by extension matches the existing lot coverage. The new mixed-use addition maintains a
seventy-five foot space between it and the JL Hudson home giving similar breadth and and air
indigenous to the original neighborhood coverage west of Brush Street.

(19) Degree of complexity with the facades. ​The older houses in the district are generally characterized

by a high degree of complexity within the facades, with bay windows, towers, porches, window and door
hoods, elaborate cornices, and other devices used to decorate the buildings. Newer houses in the northern
end of the district and older houses in the southern end tend to be somewhat simpler than high Victorian
structures between them; later apartments and commercial buildings tend to more classical decorative
elements of a simpler kind.
112 EDMUND
● On John R, Edmund Place and the Alley, 112’s facade has a restrained complexity on the upper
portion with a static brick base with a simple, flattened zig-zag brick walls at the pedestrian’s
ground level that creates both an interesting public zone spatially and visually due to the
shadow-play. The ornamentation offered by the unique brick pattern of the soffit band harkens
back to some of the traditional brickwork found in the neighborhood.
● Along Historic Home, in addition to a similar treatment to the other three facades, a large area of
unadorned brickwork acts as a simple backdrop to The Lucien Moore Estate allowing this great
existing building to be enjoyed without a lot of background visual clutter.
2827 JOHN R
● On John R, the Carriage House masonry openings are existing, statically arranged and remain
unchanged. The compositionally static masonry openings in the 1920-40s low building will be
enlarged to be more vertical and otherwise unchanged. The new portion of the building above
the existing will be generally opening and transparent. The fantastic existing decorative brickwork
will be brought back to its former glory through a thorough cleaning and repair as necessary.
● The new portion of the building above the existing will be generally opening and transparent.
Wood sunshades on the facades are smartly placed from an interiors perspective but appear as
random on the facade. The windows on the townhouse building are vertically orientated with a
composed placement.
● On Alley, the Carriage House masonry openings are existing and remain unchanged. The parking
structure exterior envelope is a vertically oriented blackened wood plank. Its intention is to be
spare and unadorned giving respect to and not competing with the Carriage House.
● Along Historic Home, the parking structure exterior envelope is a vertically oriented blackened
wood plank. The windows closest to Alfred Street are of a taller proportion. This facade acts as
simple backdrop to the JL Hudson Home.

​ rientation, vistas, overviews. ​Houses are generally oriented to the east-west streets, while
(20) O
apartments and commercial structures are more often oriented to the north-south streets. The
construction of the Fisher Freeway has created an artificial public view of the rear yards on Winder
between Woodward and Brush. The vacant land in the area, largely the result of demolition, creates
long-distance views and views of individual buildings from unusual angles which are foreign to the
character of the neighborhood as an intensely developed urban area. Garages and coach houses are

 located in the rear of residential properties, and are generally oriented to the alley.
112 EDMUND
● On John R, the broad front facade of the building is oriented toward the main thoroughfare, as
are the other existing apartment buildings of its kind. Windows and balconies are regularly
ordered on the facade and oriented perpendicularly to John R.
● On Edmund Place, although the length and mass of the building is oriented to face John R, the
residential entry is oriented to Edmund Place. This allows the building to be sympathetic to both
the context of large East-West facades along John R as well as the rhythm of residential entry
along Edmund Place. The building is oriented toward each bordering street in a manner that is
characteristic of existing structures on that street.
● On the alley, exit from the underground parking level is discharged more than 70 feet from John
R Street in order to mitigate queuing on the other streets around the building. Service entries to
trash and mechanical spaces are also oriented to face the Alley.
● Along the Lucien Moore home, relief is given to the Northern end of the facade by curtain wall,
increasing the visibility to and from the existing home. The dissolving of the solid wall on this
elevation is a way to ease the transition of the 5-8 story structures along John R to the 3-4 story
homes along Edmund Place.
2827 JOHN R
● On John R, the apartments are held up above the existing brick structure and are oriented along
John R, as is typical of apartment buildings on this street.
● On Alfred Street, the new parking structure is fully masked by the townhomes, maintaining the
residential character of the street, but also maintaining the existing organization of parking in the
neighborhood (home in front and garage behind - as the elements of design notes, “garages and
coach houses are located in the rear of residential properties.) The same can be said for the
elevation on John R. The residential units facing John R Street mask a large majority of the garage
behind. The outdoor dining terrace at the intersection of John R and Alfred allows for expansive
views of the Ransom Gillis home from quite some distance down the block. The program of the
outdoor terrace at the foot of the beautifully restored Ransom Gillis fulfills a great opportunity
for display and celebration of one of the existing gems of Brush Park.
● On Alley, the existing location of the carriage house is maintained as a critical part of the alley
streetscape. The new parking structure further down the alley is set off from and aligned with
the existing carriage house. Vehicle exit from the parking structure is primarily directed onto the
alley as to mitigate queuing and traffic on other, more major streets around the site.
● Along Historic Home, the spacing between it and the new building, being similar to the spacing of
the other buildings on the street, allows for pedestrian views of a developed urban area without
a continuous street wall. The Alfred Street townhomes fill the void of a seemingly missing home.

(21)Symmetric or asymmetric appearance. ​In the Victorian structures, examples of both symmetric and

asymmetric design occur; symmetry is more characteristic of the earlier houses, while the high Victorian
examples are more likely to assemble elements in a romantic, asymmetric composition. Later houses to
the north are more often symmetrical, especially when derived from classical precedent. Asymmetrical but
balanced compositions are common. Later apartments are generally symmetrical.
112 EDMUND
● On John R, the windows and massing are generally symmetrical, with select asymmetric formal
moves meant to balance the composition of the facade. Base elements are intentionally placed in

 ●
●
●

symmetry.
On Edmund Place, the building is intentionally symmetrical in elevation to mirror the symmetric
reading of the Lucien Moore Estate, but in plan, in similar fashion, asymmetric moves give relief
to the facade.
On Alley, the base and residential program is symmetric in elevation with asymmetry coming
from the commercial reveal at levels 2 and 3.
Along Historic Home, the building is mostly symmetric, especially along the backdrop of the
Lucien Moore Estate, to provide balance, with some asymmetry occuring at the main residential
lobby to provide visual difference, showing greater importance to the entry sequence.

2827 JOHN R
● On John R, the bulk massing is meant to float above a glass reveal, providing a grounded base,
setback middle and balanced top. This is done as an overall symmetrical form, with asymmetrical
moves used in the banding between residential units to provide contemporary juxtaposition to
the existing masonry shell of the carriage house below.
● On Alfred Street, picking up on queues from the neighboring historic homes (JL Hudson Home,
Elisha Taylor Home)​, window patterning and openings along the townhomes are placed within a
4’ grid, but shifted to provide visual interest in thoughtful compositions. Pronounced trim
elements become an extension of the residential program, outlining the extents of the homes
beyond. Asymmetrical openings become outdoor green terraces along the street.
● On Alley, asymmetry is used to balance the symmetry of 112 Edmund building across the alley.
Window patterning is placed symmetrically within asymmetric building forms, giving visual
interest to the facade.
● Along Historic Home, formal moves are restrained, with simple asymmetric screens providing
growing walls for vegetation to become a soft backdrop to the formally interesting victorian
moves on the historic JL Hudson Home. The top floor sets back to allow for a contemporary
“mansard” reading between the leading edge of the townhomes against the highpoint of the
screen beyond.

(22)General environmental character. ​The environmental character is of an old urban neighborhood
which has undergone, and is undergoing, considerable change. The original development, reflected in the
Victorian period houses, has been altered by the provision of more intensive residential development in the
early twentieth century, the change in character of Woodward from residential to commercial at about the
same time and a long period of decline.
●

●

The proposed buildings are characteristic of the “considerable change” going on in Brush Park. By
concealing required parking space behind retail and residential space that will bring life to the
streets, the neighborhood is given the opportunity to evolve from a largely vacant expanse with a
few historic gems into a vibrant urban neighborhood with a dense population of folks who can
enjoy the history that surrounds them.
The proposed buildings also formalize a way in which the new in Brush Park can make the old more
prominent. The open dining garden in front of the Ransom Gillis home provides a vibrant setting for
neighbors and visitors to take in the historic character of the neighborhood. The Alfred Street
townhomes fill the obvious residential void that exists currently and will provide the missing link in
the chain of residential structures from the first home off of Woodward to the new homes of the
City Modern Development. The residential building at 112 Edmund Place will fill one of the most
obvious “missing building” space in the neighborhood which are currently contributing to the
overall sense of dilapidation and decline. The restaurant and lofts of 2827 are delicately inserted
into the old carriage house and memorialize a piece of the historical narrative that is unique to

 ●

Brush Park.
“The environmental character is of an old urban neighborhood which has undergone, and is
undergoing, considerable change.” Of all the considerations, this, perhaps more than any other has
driven the design of the proposed buildings. It is that quality of maintaining historic character in the
presence of considerable change that will help Brush Park realize its bright future.

EQUITONE material sampler

  

EQUITONE is a through-coloured facade material designed by and for
architects. Our company has produced these façade panels since the 1950´s
under the name ¨ETERNIT¨. Every EQUITONE panel is unique, showing the raw,
untreated texture of the fibre cement base material. Fibre cement is a cement
composite material that consists of cement, cellulose and mineral materials,
reinforced by a visible matrix. Nothing else. The EQUITONE material comes in
a maximum panel size of 1,25 x 3m (4´x 10´) and can be transformed into
any size or shape in the workshop or on-site. Furthermore, the material can be
perforated or printed. Visible and invisible rainscreen fixing methods can be
used including riveting, screwing and bonding on metal or wood supporting
frames. No matter what design options you explore, the through-coloured
nature of EQUITONE assures crisp, monolithic details.

Trifab™ VG (VersaGlaze™)

Trifab™ VG 450, 451 & 451T (Thermal) Framing Systems &
Trifab™ 451UT (Ultra Thermal) Framing System
Design + Performance Versatility with
Unmatched Fabrication Flexibility

Preston Pointe, Louisville, KY
Architect: Potter & Associates Architects PLLC, Louisville, KY
Glazing Contractor: Kentucky Mirror & Plate Glass Company, Louisville, KY

Trifab™ VersaGlaze™ is built on the proven and successful Trifab™
platform – with all the versatility its name implies. There are enough
framing system choices, fabrication methods, design options and
performance levels to please the most discerning building owner,
architect and installer. The Trifab™ VersaGlaze™ family’s newest
addition, Trifab™ 451UT (Ultra Thermal) framing system, is designed
for the most demanding thermal performance and employs a “dual”
Isolock™ Thermal Break.

Aesthetics
Trifab™ VersaGlaze™ framing systems offer designers a choice of
front-, center-, back- or multi-plane glass applications. Structural silicone
glazing (SSG) and Weatherseal glazing options further expand the
designers’ choices, allowing for a greater range of design possibilities
for specific project requirements and architectural styles. All systems
have a 4-1/2" frame depth – Trifab™ VersaGlaze™ 450 has 1-3/4"
sightlines, while Trifab™ VersaGlaze™ 451/451T and Trifab™ 451UT
have 2" sightlines. THERMALLY-BROKEN, INSULATED

EGS 01

STOREFRONT SYSTEM WITH LOW-E GLASS.
B.O.D. KAWNEER 451T-VG W KYNAR FINISH

 With seamless incorporation of Kawneer entrances or windows, including
GLASSvent™ visually frameless ventilators, Trifab™ VersaGlaze™ can
be used on almost any project. These framing systems can also be
packaged with Kawneer curtain walls and overhead glazing, thereby
providing a full range of proven, and tested, quality products for the
owner, architect and installer from a single source supplier.

Performance
Kawneer’s Isolock™ Thermal Break process creates a composite
section, prevents dry shrinkage and is available on Trifab™
VersaGlaze™ 451T. For even greater thermal performance, a “dual”
Isolock™ Thermal Break is used on Trifab™ 451UT.

Economy
Trifab™ VersaGlaze™ 450/451/451T framing systems offer four
fabrication choices to suit your project (Trifab™ 451UT available as screw
spline fabrication only):
•S
  crew Spline – for economical continuous runs utilizing two
piece vertical members that provide the option to pre-assemble
units with controlled shop labor costs and smaller field crews for
handling and installation.
•S
  hear Block – for punched openings or continuous runs using
tubular moldings with shear block clips that provide tight joints for
transporting large pre-assembled multi-lite units.
•S
  tick – for fast, easy field fabrication. Field measurements and
material cuts can be done when metal is on the job.
•T
  ype B – Same fabrication benefits as shear block except head
and sill run through.
All systems can be flush glazed from either the inside or outside. The
Weatherseal option provides an alternative to SSG vertical mullions
for Trifab™ VersaGlaze™ 450/451/451T. This ABS/ASA rigid polymer
extrusion allows complete
inside glazing and creates
a flush glass appearance
on the building exterior
without the added labor
of scaffolding or swing
stages. Additionally, HighPerformance (HP) Flashing
options are engineered

blind seals.

For the Finishing Touch
Architectural Class I anodized aluminum finishes are available in clear
and Permanodic™ color choices.
Painted finishes, including fluoropolymer, that meet AAMA 2605
are offered in many standard choices and an unlimited number of
specially designed colors.

Trifab™ 451UT uses a “dual” Isolock™ Thermal Break (right) and
features a new HP (High Performance) sill design, which incorporates a
screw-applied end dam (left), ensuring positive engagement and tight
joints between the sill flashing and end dam.

U-factor, CRF values and STC ratings for Trifab™ VersaGlaze™ vary
depending upon the glass plane application. Project specific U-factors
can be determined for each individual project. (See the Kawneer
Architectural Manual or Kawneer.com for additional information).
