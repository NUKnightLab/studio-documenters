Re: Dr. Stephen Cine Recommendation
Dear Honorable Toni Preckwinkle":

I am happy to provide the information requested by your office. regarding Dr. Stephen Cine, with the
understanding that this information will he kept con?dential and only shared with Cook County Board Committee
Members and not shared with the media especially- as it relates to the use of my name.

In my role at the University of Miami tissue Bonk I reported directly to Dr. Stephen Elna, Associate
Medical Director and Chief Administrative Oi?oer, during his tenure with the company as the Director of Donor
Programs. Typically, in the tissue banking industry, there is a huge learning curve however Dr. Elna grasped the
tissue banking industry processes, standards and regulations very quickly which allowed for him to significantly
contribute to the success of the organization- almost immediately. His leadership style is, conducive to developing
high performing teams and promoting camaraderie between departments. He is fair, communicative, consistent,
firm and personable. Although he held a C?l?evel position, Dr. Cine actively participated in day-to-day operational
tasks to facilitate and accelerate initiatives that were either cost-saving andfor improve ef?ciencies;

?scal year begins June 1" and ends May 31?. Dr. Cine joined UMTB at the end of FY11. in FY11, UMTB had
325 donors from our local donor service area and 111 outside BSA for a total of 49.6 donors. In comparison,
FY12, UMTB had 407 donors from the local 05A. and 389 outside USA for a total of 796. donors overall for the year.
This equates to 25% increase in donors in the local DSA and 127% increase in donors outside DSA with an overall
increase of 61% increase in donors over FY11. This is a direct result of Dr. Gina's leadership.

in closing, there is a saying; one man's loss is another? 5 gain. Although lam happy that Dr. Elna has a wonderful
opportunity to join your team as the Chief Medical Examiner Cook County, it is with sadness to see him go. Dr.
Cine, and his proven successful track record, will contribute significantly to providing excellent leadership to your
team.

Re: Stephen Cina, M.D.

It is my pleasure to recommend without reservation that Dr. Cina be con?rmed as the
Chief Medical Examiner of Cook County.

Since meeting Dr. Cina nearly 15 years ago, I have had the good fortune to get to know
him personally as well as professionally. Ihave had the opportunity to observe his work in
various national organizations and have discussed many individual cases and forensic issues with
him. We have served together on various committees in national professional organizations and I
am currently the vice-chair of the Forensic Resource Committee of the College of American
Pathologists, a committee that Dr. Cina chairs.

Dr. Cina is a very talented forensic pathologist well-versed in both the art and science of
forensic pathology. He also has the personality, knowledge and experience to oversee the
medicolegal office of a large metropolitan area. He adheres to high professional and ethical
standards. He gets along well with others, both peers and subordinates. He is well-known and
respected within the forensic pathology community and is very active in a variety of national
professional organizations. He has good insight into issues and consistently uses good
judgement.

The citizens of Cook County will be well-served having Dr. Cina as their Chief Medical
Examiner. I look forward to welcoming Steve to the Midwest forensic pathology contingent and
continuing to work with him both on national and regional issues.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or would like to discuss
this matter with me.

RE: Letter of Recommendation Stephen J. Cina, M.D.

Dear President Preckwinkle:

I am writing in support of Dr. Stephen Cina to become the next Cook County Medical Examiner. This
letter is written in my personal capacity and the opinions contained within are solely those of the writer.
They do not re?ect the opinionts) of my current employer, Broward County or the State of Florida. 
have recently started the process of retiring from US Naval Service and am working in Broward County,
per Department of Defense regulations, during my period of terminal leave. As such, i am still
technically on active duty as a commissioned of?cer. This letter does not re?ect the opinionls) of the
Armed Forces Medical Examiner System, The United States Army Medical Research and Materials
Command, the United States military components, or the United States Government.

have known Dr. Cina since 1996 when we trained together as fellows in forensic pathology in
Baltimore, MD. Since that time we have stayed in contact and worked professionally on various
forensically related committees and projects. We were on active duty at the same time, but never
worked together in the military. We have never worked in the same medical examiner of?ce or ever
had an employee/employer relationship. Our personal [family relationships have been sporadic and
usually associated with a professional function or meeting.

Dr. Cina is a top forensic and clinical pathologist. His knowledge base is wide ranging in fields of
medicine beyond forensic pathology and he has applied this knowledge to expand the ?eld of medicine
through numerous research reports and studies. From what I know, he ran a very successful private
medical practice in Colorado before moving to Florida.

I believe that with the appropriate support from the County, he has the skills and background to serve as
a compassionate and knowledgeable Chief Medical Examiner.

If I may be of further assistance, please contact me.

Re: Recommendation for Dr. Stephen Cina
Dear President Preckwinkle:

it is my distinct honor and pleasure to write a letter of recommendation for
Dr. Stephen Cina. have known Dr. Cina since his Anatomic Pathology
residency at the Medical University of South Carolina and have observed
his professional growth to become a highly respected leader in the
medicolegal death investigation community. His leadership in the National
Association of Medical Examiners (NAME) and the College of American
Pathologists (CAP) is respected and admired. Most recently, I have had
the privilege of working with Dr. Cina in his role as the President of the
Florida Association of Medical Examiners (FAME) and as a colleague in my
neighboring medical examiner district of Broward County, Florida (District
17). Dr. Cina?s medical knowledge is superior and his work ethic is
exemplary. His fund of knowledge, professional reputation, experience,
and keen understanding of the death investigation process are critical
attributes he will bring as the new Cook County Medical Examiner.

Although many of us would like to see Dr. Cina as a District Medical
Examiner in the Florida system, i wish him all the best in his new position
as the Chief Medical Examiner of Cook County,

Dear President Preckwinkle,

have known Dr Stephen Cina since July 1, 1996 when he joined the staff at the Of?ce of the Chief Medical Examiner as
a fellow in forensic pathology. The Fellowship program is designed to take someone who is quali?ed as a hospital
pathologist and give them the additional training and knowledge to become a forensic pathologist and medical examiner.

At that time i was an assistant medical examiner and directly supervising the fellows in training. I had daily interactions
with Dr. Cina as we investigated death cases together. From the very beginning he was an exceptionally motivated, highly
intelligent, well trained, and extremely pleasant individual to work with. He was well-liked by all of the professional and
support staff and treated every person he came in contact with. including families. in a calm and professional manner.

He was unusual in his fellowship in that he actively sought out the more complex death investigations than most and
thrived on the challenge. During his time here he far exceeded the number of death investigations that is required as part
of the training to the point where he closely approached the maximum number allowed by national practice standards and
we had to restrain him.

in addition he actively sought out opportunities and made himself available out of hours to do additional scene
investigations. During his time at the Of?ce of the Chief Medical Examiner he had the opportunity to testify in court four
times. This is no small achievement given that the lag time between the death and a case being prosecuted usually
exceeds nine months.

All in all during his fellowship Dr. Cina was an absolute pleasure to have on staff. All of the staff were sorry to see him
leave at the end of his year of training as he had military commitments. If it was not for those military commitments feel
con?dent that he would have been offered a position and joined the staff here in Baltimore.

If at any time a position opened up here in Baltimore at the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner and Dr. Cina was
interested in it, he would be one of the top candidates without any question.

After Dr. Cina left the Of?ce of the Chief Medical Examiner we have remained in contact and usually have the
opportunity of seeing him at professional meetings several times a year. He has done multiple presentations to the
national meetings, published multiple papers and been very active on multiple committees and the board of directors of
our national professional organization. He is also the representative of our professional organization to the College of
American Pathologists.

Re: Dr. Stephen Cina recommendation

Dear Ms. Preckwi-nkle,

I offer this letter in strong support of Dr. Stephen Cina for the position of Chief Medical
Examiner for Cook County.

I have known Dr. Cina for over a decade. I have worked with him for several years on
committee work for both the National Association of Medical Examiners and the College of
American Pathologists. He has served in leadership roles in both of those organizations, and his
exceptional contributions to them are widely recognized in ohr ?eld.

One of Dr. Cina?s particular is that he is quite adept at troubleshooting systems-based
problems and implementing solutions. He is not only a top-notch forensic pathologist but also a
keen administrator. A perfect example of this is his work with the United States Virgin Islands.
That jurisdiction was experiencing difficulties with their medical examiner system at the most
basic level: the provision of services. He approached them about providing high quality forensic
pathology services, worked out a service agreement, and put together a group of medical
examiners (which included myself) to rotate traveling there to provide interim coverage during a
time of critical need.

I also work closely with Dr. Cina in my role as Editor-In?Chief of Academic Forensic Pathology:
The Official Publication of the National Association of Medical Examiners. He is a member of
the Editorial Board of that journal. He has published extensively in this and other journals as
well.

Dr. Cina has consistently demonstrated professionalism, integrity, and adherence to the highest
ethical standards. His attention to detail, quality, and service is superb. He is deeply committed
to forensic pathology and thrives on diving into challenging environments and implementing
solutions. He is highly regarded within the forensic pathology community.

On a personal note, I met Dr. Cina at the very beginning of my career, and?throughout that time
he has mentored me and given me valuable advice. I admire and look up to him as an
outstanding mentor and colleague, and he is also as a close personal friend. I give him the

Re: Letter of Recommendation for Dr. Stephen Cina
Dear Board President Preckwinkle,

It is my privilege and honor to recommend Dr. Stephen Cina for the position of Chief
Medical Examiner for Cook County Illinois. I met Dr. Cina several years ago alter he
was appointed Coroner for Weld County.

When I ?rst met Dr. Cina I was a member of the Coroner Oversight Committee. In
that position I was able to observe Dr. Cina?s professionalism and dedication. Dr.
Cina took over the Coroner?s Of?ce at a time when there was much change and
confusion occurring in the O?ice. Due to his leadership the Coroner?s Of?ce quickly
turned arotmd and beeame a very competent and respected entity.

Dr. Cina is very intelligent and knowledgeable. Recently Dr. Cina was ?own back to
Colorado by the Coroner?s Association to teach several classes to the newly elected
Coroners. Several of them told me afterwards how informative and interesting Dr.
Cina?s classes were.

There is no doubt that Dr. Cina will represent Cook County with the highest level of
ethical standards and professionalism. If you have any further questions please feel
free to contact me.

In Re Recommendation of Dr. Stephen J. Cina, M.D.
To Whom it Might Concern:

have had the privilege of knowing Dr. Stephen J. Cina for many years in his capacity as Deputy Chief
Medical Examiner for Broward County, Florida.

I have been a prosecuting attorney in the Broward County State Attorney?s Office for over 34 years,
specializing solely in homicide cases for the past 23 years. For the last 7 years I have been Chief of the
Homicide Unit. In my capacity as a prosecutor have had the occasion to interact with Dr. Cina on
countless occasions involving innumerable homicides and suspicious deaths. Dr. Cina?s knowledge,
insight and professionalism as a forensic pathologist have always been at an outstanding level.
Moreover, Dr. Cina has continually conducted himself with a spirit of cooperation and what has been
noted to comprise an abiding view toward what is just and right.

In my considered opinion, Dr. Cina is an exceptional doctor, an extraordinarily fine witness and a
consummate gentleman. His conduct on and off the witness stand has always been exemplary and of
the highest order. Dr. Cina?s superb diligence and equanimity of temperament are tremendous assets as
well as testaments to his character. He was a credit to his office and to this County during all his years in
which he served our community so well.

i would strongly and wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Cina for the position of Medical Examiner for Cook
County.

Dear Honorable Toni Preckwinlrle
President, Cook County Board

It is our honor to write a letter of recommendation for Dr. Stephen Cine for the position of Chief
Medical Enambier of Cook County. The Coral Gables Senior High School PISA (Parent, Teacher,
Student Association) has been extremely fortunate that Dr. Cilia volunteered. to head a panel
presentation for drivers and passengers regarding the dangrs and consequences of driving 0r titling
with someone under the in?uence or distracted. Dr. (?ns combined his extensive experience and
knowledge with his ability to reach high school students enthuse critical subjerrls.

Dr. Cina informed the attendees of the dangers, potential physical and emotional injury, or even fatal
consequences of driving. under the influence of illegal drugs, over the counter drugs, andlor alcohol. He
also shared with its the possible consequences of driving while distracted (testing, phone calls, music,
etc). He helped the audience realize the critical importance for drivers and passengers to use sound
judgment in their decisions about driving, and about with whom they pt into 'a car.

Alongwith Dr. Cine, our aimwastogive incidents ahettershotat agoodandlonglimii/e feltthatif
we achieved our goal of raising awareness and keeping even one teen from being hurt or hurting
someone else, it would he more than worth it. Dr. Cine certainly enmeded that goal.

Dr. Cilia has graciously presented this powerful, informative and effective program for at least 3 years.
Generally, very few students attend our PTSA meetings, however, they came for Dr. Gina's program.
The ?rst presentation was so impressive that the school administration asked Dr. Cine to present a-
second session during school hours for all seniors before they attended the prom. Students and parents
approached Dr. Cina alter the presentation to request further information. We received wonderful
feedback from many attendees thanking us for the prom and infonning us about the ham it had
made on them.

It may seem unusual to inetude this point in his recommendation, hoorever we woold like to add that
Dr. Cina is extremely apprOaChable and personable, with a ready smile and delightful sense of humor.

We wish Dr. Cina much happiness and reward in his new endeavors.

Sincerely,

Re: Stephen J. Cina, M.D., Recommendation
Dear President Preckwinkle:

This letter is submitted in strong support of the appointment of Stephen J. Cina, M.D., as chief
medical examiner of Cook County. I have known Dr. Cina for 16 years; my contacts with him
have been primarily through forensic science professional organizations and educational
meetings. Dr. Cina is an outstanding forensic pathologist of national repute and is held in high
regard by his colleagues.

Dr. Cina received his undergraduate education at Johns Hopkins University and earned his
Doctor of Medicine degree ?'om Vanderb?t University. He has had outstanding training in
anatomic and surgical pathology at the Medical University of South Carolina and Johns Hopkins
Hospital. He received his training in forensic pathology at the Of?ce of the Chief Medical
Examiner of Maryland in Baltimore, a system that is very similar to Cook County in size and
complexity.

Dr. Cina is certi?ed by the American Board of Pathology in anatomic and forensic pathology.
He is licensed to practice medicine in Florida and Colorado. He has held clinical or voluntary
faculty appointments at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicme and Nova
Southeastern University College of Osteopathic Medicine. Dr. Cina has extensive experenience
working in coroner and medical examiner of?ces in Colorado and Florida.

Dr. Cina is a charismatic speaker and lecturer. He has published numerous scienti?c papers in
the ?eld of forensic pathology. His presentations to professional colleagues are always well
received. His excellent training and teaching ability will make it possible for him to create the
educational environment necessary for maintaining the residency training program in the Of?ce
of the Medical Examiner of Cook County.

Dr. Cina is an affable and diplomatic person, and is honest and straight forward in his dealings
with people. He will work well with medical examiner employees and other agencies. Dr.
Cina?s national reputation in forensic pathology will attract other excellent forensic pathologists

RE: Stephen J. Cina, MD, FCAP
Dear President Preckwinkle:

I had the pleasure of meeting with Dr Stephen J. Cina on July 19, 2012, along with other
members of the Medical Examiner?s Advisory Committee.

Dr Cina made a compelling presentation. He described his career track in detail, emphasizing
his excellent training, his diverse and extensive experience in the scienti?c aspects of pathology
and forensic pathology, and also wide and pertinent experience in management at operational
and executive levels.

Following his presentation, Dr Cina responded to numerous questions regarding his
expectations for the committee and his plans for the Of?ce of the Medical Examiner of Cook
County. His responses were thorough and detailed. It was evident that he understood clearly the .
important elements of the challenges facing him as future leader of this troubled entity. He
described practical interim steps to stabilize the Of?ce and is in a very good position, if properly
supported by the County, to start to right the ship. This is a multiyear project that he is
eminently quali?ed and desirous to lead. In addition to his quali?cations, he has very good
personal reasons to come to Chicago, which is reassuring given that the problems facing him will
require him to make a long-term commitment. I found Dr Cine to be a very good and articulate
communicator, which are essential elements to the position under consideration, particularly as
he must reverse the recent negative public perceptions.

The current situation of the Of?ce of the Medical Examiner of Cook County can only be
described as a crisis. The citizens of Cook County are fortunate to have a candidate of the caliber
of Dr Cina to consider. In my judgment given sustained support and patience by the President
and the Board of Commissioners and the right level of ?nancial support he will lead this service
back to a place where it must be given the size and importance of this Of?ce.

Resaecth?ly submitted,

Dear Robin Kelly,

Thank you for the opportunity to speak with Dr. Stephen Cina (on
July 2, 2012) about the role of Chief Medical Examiner of Cook
County. The conversation started with an overview of his
quali?cations (education, work experience, research, lectures, sic.)
and than we discussed why this opportunity is a good ?t for him at
this stage of his career. Then we discussed obstacles with accepting
this position. The obstacles included appropriate staf?ng levels (and
quality of staff), ?scal capacity and support (from President
and Robin Kelly). I-le reiterated several times that he
needs capacity and support to carry-out his vision for the department.
And then concluded with how he will communicate with the general
public to reassure them the Medical Examiner (ME) office is moving
in the right direction. .

in addressing the few questions I posed, he spoke with enthusiasm
and Optimism that with the appropriate resources and support he can
take the department from a negative perception to a national model of
excellence. His approach to educating community stakeholders
(political and community leaders to the everyday citizen) on the
duties, responsibilities and importance of the ME office will be a
fundamental component in moving this department in the right
direction.

i will support your decision to offer Dr. Stephen Cina the position of
Chief Medical Officer of Cook County. If you have any questions or
concerns, please feel free to contact me at your convenience.

Dear President Preckwinkle,

Thank you for the opportunity to meet Dr. Stephen J. Cina last Thursday. As a member of the Medical
Examiner Advisory Board lam in support of conferring the appointment of Dr. Cina as the Chief Medical
Examiner of Cook County.

Although our meeting was rather brief, my impression of him was positive, and I believe he appreciates
the enormity of the task he is about to embark on. He stated that his first priority will be to reestablish
the trust of the citizens of Cook County, restore dignity to the office and begin active and aggressive
recruitment of qualified Forensic Pathologists. Among other ideas, Dr. Cina suggested that conducting a
thorough audit of the facility will be helpful to identify deficiencies and improve efficiencies as soon as
possible.

Dr. Cina assured us that he was committed to serving Cook County long?term and working closely with
the Board of Commissioners, the Advisory Board and the dedicated doctors and staff of the Office of the
Medical Examiner.

Respectfully Submitted,

Susan J. Dyer, LFD, LE
