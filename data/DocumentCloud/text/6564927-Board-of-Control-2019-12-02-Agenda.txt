NOTE:
Initially the expenses will be covered by HHS Levy Funds and will be reimbursed by Annie E. Casey
Foundation
Purpose:
The Annie E. Casey Foundation is exploring a new training method called ShadowBox that aims to help
child welfare workers make the best decisions for kids and families. Named after the boxing practice of
sparring with an imaginary foe before a big bout, ShadowBox is designed to help people in high-stakes
jobs – such as firefighters, military personnel and nurses – think strategically. Gary Klein, a senior scientist
at MacroCognition LLC, helped develop both the training and the field of naturalistic decision making,
which examines how people react and perform in demanding situations. The Casey Foundation has
worked with Klein’s team to pilot a ShadowBox approach tailored for child protective workers in three
sites: Jefferson County, Colorado, Cuyahoga County, Ohio; and Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. The
training goal? Promote a problem-solving mindset that emphasizes going above and beyond rules and
procedures to ensure a child’s well-being.

CORRECTIONS CENTER SECURITY IMPROVEMENTS: HIGH RISK MENTAL HEALTH CELLS VIDEO
SURVEILLANCE
Scope of Work Summary
Department of Information Technology on behalf of the Sheriff’s Office requesting approval of a RFP
Exemption for purchase and installation with Integrated Precisions Systems, Inc in the amount of
$70,106.96.
The County operates an Enterprise, Networked Physical Security System throughout the County. There
are over 200 existing cameras in Jails 1 and 2. Upon review of the issues presented by various assessments
of the facilities and a review with current Corrections’ Management, products and recommendations
were determined. The purchase of these cameras will assist staff in monitoring those inmates who are
determined to present a high risk of self-harm or harm to others. The ability to monitor multiple cells
simultaneously helps mitigate the risk of harm an inmate may do and allows for efficient deployment of
staff.
The equipment being purchased is expanding the currently installed system that IPS is under contract to
maintain. Any additions to the current system will have to involve our current vendor (IPS) due to the
architecture and infrastructure that has been built out. Introducing other vendors and equipment is not
cost effective or functionally appropriate. Should other vendors start supplying “pieces parts” to this
system, the County runs the risk of having multiple points of failure and complicates the management and
troubleshooting of the system. Doing so would compromise the integrity of the systems and create
confusion in the management and support of the systems. When the County required Whiting-Turner to
bid the security equipment for the new Maintenance Yard, months of additional time was added to the
project completion time line. In addition, tens of thousands of dollars was added to the cost of the project
for contractors and subcontractors. Further delays in the scope of work may place the health and safety
of inmates and/or staff at risk.

ADAMHS BD - ISP FOR IOP MHDD 2020-2021
The Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court and the Corrections Planning Board are requesting authority
to contract with the Alcohol, Drug Addiction and Mental Health Services (ADAMHS) Board of Cuyahoga
County in the amount of $219,000.00 for the oversight of the Catholic Charities/Matt Talbot facility’s
efforts that provide Intensive Out-Patient (IOP) and Aftercare Counseling services for clients assigned to
the Intensive Service Probation cases, and to provide stepdown IOP services for the Mental Health and
Developmental Disabilities (MHDD) Residential Program. Services under this Dually Diagnosed Offender
Intensive Aftercare Program will occur from July 1, 2019, through June 30, 2021.
Funding Source: Ohio Community Correction Act (CCA) 407 funding
Scope of Work Summary
Under the contract the ADAMHS Board of Cuyahoga County will oversee the efforts of Catholic
Charities/Matt Talbot facility to provide offenders with Intensive Outpatient Group Sessions, Group
Counseling, Individual Counseling through IOP Sessions, and Case Management through Group Sessions
under the Dually Diagnosed Offender Intensive Aftercare Program. It is expected that approximately 110
new clients (50% female and 50% male) will be served under the program. An estimated 85% of the
population will be unemployed and an estimated 100% of the population may present with a concurrent
mental health diagnosis. The intent of the program is to provide a comprehensive approach to addressing
substance abuse and behaviors associated with illicit activity, which leads to incarceration. The
Corrections Planning Board monitors the program through random site visits, fiscal review and client
outcomes.

38

 The reason this item is being submitted well after the contract start date of July 1, 2019 includes the
following issues influencing the submission date.
1. The State of Ohio did not pass the current two (2) year budget until July 15, 2019.
2. The Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction received confirmation as to their community
corrections funding availability on July 17, 2019.
3. Although the contract would have already be at least three (3) weeks late if the Corrections Planning
Board had the ability to move it forward at that time, we were unable to do so because of the required
appropriations underpinning the contract required approval prior to this happening.
4. In August, there was only one (1) fiscal agenda (August 6th) Corrections Planning Board potentially
could have placed the appropriations item on. The August 6th meeting was not on the original schedule
released by OBM to include appropriations. By the time the Court learned that appropriations were
to be included in the August 6th meeting, the deadline to submit required documents had passed (July
25th).
5. Upon review of required OnBase documentation that accompanies all contracts, the Corrections
Planning Board discovered that during this lapse in time, the Vendor-provided certificates for
insurance had expired. The Vendor was contacted and provided an updated certificate on 09/06/19.
6. The next scheduled meeting with appropriations on the agenda did not take place until September
10th with funding becoming available September 11th.
Signed contracts were returned by the ADAMHS Board to the Corrections Planning Board Sept 24, 2019.
Little or nothing under the control of the Corrections Planning Board can be changed to avoid this chain
of events from happening in the future.
