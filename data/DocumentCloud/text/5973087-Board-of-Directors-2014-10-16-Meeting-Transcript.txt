CHAIRMAN BELL:

We'll just get started.

2

Let me call to order our meeting and welcome all

3

our guests and our participants to the October

4

meeting of the Chicago Infrastructure Trust.

5

Now, we have a full agenda today.

6

I'm hoping we're ready to snap through this

7

because remember, we do have two hours, and I

8

want to be mindful of people's times, and I also

9

want to make sure we do have some people that

10

want to have public comment, so I want to make

11

sure we get to that while they're still able to

12

be here and speak, and I don't want to put

13

public comment in front because I want to make

14

sure that they also have an opportunity to

15

comment on what we've discussed as well as the

16

other things that they may have on their mind.

17
18

With that, Steve, I'm going to turn
it over to you and let's get started.

19

MR. BEITLER:

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

20

Here is the agenda for today's meeting.

21

first item on the agenda is the approval of the

22

July 17th minutes.

23

resolution for approval of the minutes.

24

The

Any comment, questions or do I

3

MR. HOFFMAN:

4

ALDERMAN POPE:

Second.

5

CHAIRMAN BELL:

All in favor.

6

(A chorus of ayes.)

7

MR. BEITLER:

8
9

Motion.

Thank you, sir.

Next, just for information purposes,
we're still finetuning this, but these are the

10

tentative dates for the Board's calendar for the

11

upcoming year, and we'll circle back around with

12

all the Board Members to make sure that those

13

dates are --

14

CHAIRMAN BELL:

You know, as we have

15

talked in the past, we'll put these on our

16

calendar, and the question to the staff is is

17

this adequate to support the ongoing efforts or

18

you can let us know.

19

MR. BEITLER:

We added one Board

20

meeting to the 2015 calendar over the previous

21

years.

22

We've added five.

23

meeting for this year, and we will keep in mind

24

if there's a need for additional meetings to

So in previous years we've had four.
We've added a fifth scheduled

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company

312-346-0911

 Page 4

schedule them.

2
3

CHAIRMAN BELL:
this is adequate?

4

MR. BEITLER:

5

CHAIRMAN BELL:

6

Right now you think

Well, we hope it is.
Okay.

Any comments

from the rest of the Board?

7

(No response.)

8

Okay.

9

Keep going.

MR. BEITLER:

Next, we are required

10

through our bylaws and charter to provide an

11

annual report.

12

report which is a one-page cover letter to the

13

audit, and this is essentially the essence of

14

what was in the annual report, and the annual

15

report requires a resolution which is here.

16

You've all received the annual

CHAIRMAN BELL:

We went through the

17

report, the actual financial report last

18

meeting.

19

MR. BEITLER:

20

CHAIRMAN BELL:

21

approved it.

22

wasn't here.

23
24

Right.
Diana had already

I'm saying that because David

MR. BEITLER:

Well, the Board approved

the audit.

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company

312-346-0911

 Page 5

CHAIRMAN BELL:

and this is the report that goes with it.

3
4

MR. BEITLER:

So this is a cover letter

on the audit to the Mayor and the City Council.

5

CHAIRMAN BELL:

6

MR. HOFFMAN:

7

We approved the audit,

Okay.

Any questions?

I don't have any

questions.

8

CHAIRMAN BELL:

All right.

10

ALDERMAN POPE:

Move do pass.

11

MR. HOFFMAN:

9

Can we get

a motion?

12

Second.

(A chorus of ayes.)

13

CHAIRMAN BELL:

14

MR. BEITLER:

15

Passed.
Thank you.

For information, some administrative

16

activities.

First, there are two new hires at

17

the Trust, and so Mike Mirretti, if you could

18

just stand up.

19

director, and Rhea Coleman --

Mike is coming in as a managing

20

CHAIRMAN BELL:

21

MR. BEITLER:

Welcome aboard.
-- if you could stand up.

22

Rhea is coming in as the office manager for the

23

Trust.

24

CHAIRMAN BELL:

So now we have three

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company
www.veritext.com

312-346-0911

 Page 6

employees?

2
3

MR. BEITLER:

Yes, we have three

employees now.

4

CHAIRMAN BELL:

One woman, one African

5

American and you, huh, one bald headed guy?

6

think we're covered.

7

MR. BEITLER:

8

CHAIRMAN BELL:

9

I

I have no category.
I want to make sure the

record shall remind us of our diversity policy.

10

MR. BEITLER:

We are deploying our new

11

information technology architecture.

12

redeploying the website to make further

13

improvements in terms of how we present

14

information and also to provide abilities for

15

people to subscribe to different activities that

16

we're doing.

17

We will be

So if you're interested in

18

streetlights, you can subscribe for streetlight

19

information.

20

project, you could subscribe for that project.

21

If you're interested in some other

We are also getting our internal

22

architecture and systems online so that all of

23

our filing is essentially on the web and

24

available to all employees wherever they are so

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company
www.veritext.com

312-346-0911

 Page 7
1

that we're able to maintain a complete file of

2

information, and we've just put in a new

3

telephone system which we're getting the hang of

4

so it will be easier for everybody to call us.

5

We had an unqualified audit for 2013

6

in stub year 2012, meaning that there were no

7

corrections whatsoever.

8

colors, and there was not even one comment.

9

CHAIRMAN BELL:

10

MR. BEITLER:

We passed with flying

Good.
Then we have our new

11

office at 35 East Wacker Drive.

12

everybody to come by.

13

process of finishing getting set up, but we

14

moved in on August 11th and --

15
16

CHAIRMAN BELL:

I invite

We are still in the

Steve, do we have

adequate space there to actually have a meeting?

17

MR. BEITLER:

-- it's great.

Not to

18

hold a board meeting, we don't have that kind of

19

space, but we have a large conference room

20

which you can see on the upper right-hand side

21

and adequate space for staff to have meetings,

22

but we don't have adequate -- we couldn't afford

23

to do this.

24

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Public space.

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company

312-346-0911

 Page 8

MR. BEITLER:

Next, we're required to

2

have a whistleblower policy.

3

seen this in two locations.

4

you separately, but it's also in the employee

5

manual, and so these are largely the tenants of

6

the whistleblower policy.

7

CHAIRMAN BELL:

You would have
One we sent it to

Now, does this follow

8

the policy of the City or is this one you had to

9

develop on your own?

10

MR. HELMAN:

We developed the

11

whistleblower policy with the help of Scott Falk

12

and the team at Kirkland & Ellis.

13

MR. BEITLER:

And it was based on the

14

requirements that our auditors set out for us,

15

so this was meant to meet our requirements for

16

our charter but also from an audit standpoint

17

the requirements that we have.

18
19

CHAIRMAN BELL:

I don't even know if

the City has a whistleblower policy.

20

MR. HOFFMAN:

They do.

Just to -- It

21

sounds like Kirkland not only consulted with

22

you, but the final product is something that

23

Scott and Kirkland agrees with?

24

MR. HELMAN:

Yes, very much so.

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company
www.veritext.com

312-346-0911

 Page 9
1
2

MR. BEITLER:

So here's the resolution

to adopt the whistleblower policy.

3

CHAIRMAN BELL:

4

MS. FERGUSON:

5

MR. HOFFMAN:

6

CHAIRMAN BELL:

7

Motion.
So moved.
I second.
All in favor.

(A chorus of ayes.)

8

MR. BEITLER:

9

Adam?

10

MR. HELMAN:

11

Thank you.

Thank you, Steve.

We also have developed an employee

12

manual and that is to help the Trust as we start

13

to staff up develop as a high performing

14

professional organization.

15

standard procedures, really establish best

16

practices and fulfill again our auditing

17

requirements.

18

We want to have

We've developed a manual that takes

19

a comprehensive approach to articulating

20

expectations and really it covers staff members,

21

interns and contractors, so anybody who works

22

with the Trust.

23
24

We've developed it by adapting
material from a variety of sources so that it

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company
www.veritext.com

312-346-0911

 Page 10
1

really is customized to our needs and our

2

operations.

3

Version 1.0 and so it will evolve as the

4

organization evolves and as our needs evolve.

5

And just a final note on this, it

You should expect since this is

6

provides the basis for the Trust management to

7

obtain and offer benefits to employees.

8
9

MR. BEITLER:

The manual was reviewed

completely by and hoped to be prepared by

10

Kirkland & Ellis as well as our accountants and

11

our auditors, and so everybody as a group is in

12

concert with us and it's appropriate to go

13

forward to meet all of our different

14

requirements.

15

CHAIRMAN BELL:

16

MR. BEITLER:

17

CHAIRMAN BELL:

18

Pretty comprehensive.
Thank you.
Definitely.

Any

questions?

19

(No response.)

20

Do you need a motion?

21

MR. BEITLER:

So we have a resolution

22

for adoption of the manual and essentially

23

allowing me to then do the things that the

24

manual authorizes.

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company

MR. HOFFMAN:

Are you going to require

2

all employees to memorize it?

3

50 pages, appendices included.

4

ALDERMAN POPE:

5

MR. BEITLER:

It's only I think
Weekly quizzes.

For the three of them.
What we do intend to do

6

is to give employees adequate time to read it

7

and basically to make sure that they do

8

understand it, and there's a reason in

9

particular --

10
11

CHAIRMAN BELL:
do.

That's what directors

Remember that.

12

MR. BEITLER:

There is a reason why the

13

manual is so long.

We did incorporate a lot of

14

things that relate to operational activities of

15

the Trust because as we're conducting

16

procurement activities, it's important that all

17

the employees at the Trust, whether they are

18

contractors, interns or permanent employees,

19

understand that they could do something any

20

particular day that could have a significant

21

implication for a procurement, and so we need to

22

make sure that everybody understands what they

23

can and can't do within the boundaries of any

24

particular procurement.

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company
www.veritext.com

312-346-0911

 Page 12
1

So whether their job directly

2

relates to a procurement or not, we've asked

3

everybody to read this type of information to

4

make sure we don't have any slip ups.

5

CHAIRMAN BELL:

6

MS. FERGUSON:

Okay.
And, Steve, this

7

document will be public?

8

the website?

9
10

MR. BEITLER:

MS. FERGUSON:

12

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Thank you.
Any other questions or

comments?

14

(No response.)

15

MR. HOFFMAN:

16

MS. FERGUSON:

17

CHAIRMAN BELL:

18

I so move.
Second.
All in favor?

(A chorus of ayes.)

19
20

As soon as the Board

approves it, we will post it on the website.

11

13

It will be posted on

MR. BEITLER:

Thank you.

I will now

ask Vivian to discuss financials for the Trust.

21

MS. FUNCHES:

The first statement is

22

the statement of position as of September

23

the 30th, 2014, and our total assets as of

24

September the 30th is $221,371 and total

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company
www.veritext.com

312-346-0911

 Page 13
1

liabilities of 173,618, with our total

2

liabilities and equity at $221,371.

3

components of the assets would be our cash at

4

142,916 and fixed assets at 61,463.

5

CHAIRMAN BELL:

The major

Vivian, I didn't quite

6

understand what the project account and the Visa

7

debit accounts are.

8

the funding from the City.

9

I assume the checking is

MS. FUNCHES:

It is.

The Visa debit

10

account has been closed.

11

use for staff to go out and about and do Trust

12

business so we now have --

13
14

CHAIRMAN BELL:

We drew down on that

account, is that it?

15
16

That was for temporary

MR. BEITLER:

We couldn't get a credit

card initially.

17

MS. FUNCHES:

So we had to develop

18

credit.

So we closed that account and

19

transferred the balance to the checking account.

20

CHAIRMAN BELL:

21

MS. FUNCHES:

I see.

Okay.

The project account is

22

actually the money that would go into -- the

23

funds from the project going in there, like

24

Retrofit 1, so that's what that money is right

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company
www.veritext.com

312-346-0911

 Page 14
1

now, fees we earned over Retrofit 1.

2

CHAIRMAN BELL:

But is it the funding

3

from the City that's associated with that or is

4

it --

5

MS. FUNCHES:

6

CHAIRMAN BELL:

7

MS. FUNCHES:

The money that we would

get from someone else, fees.

10

CHAIRMAN BELL:

11

MR. BEITLER:

12

-- money we're getting

from someone else?

8
9

No.

I see.
So we maintain segregated

accounts.

13

CHAIRMAN BELL:

14

MR. HOFFMAN:

Okay.
Steve, who's responsible

15

for reviewing the use of the credit or debit

16

cards to ensure the charges are appropriate?

17

MR. BEITLER:

Basically we have our

18

outside accountants and we have auditors and

19

we're pretty scrupulous.

20

MS. FUNCHES:

21

CHAIRMAN BELL:

22

I think we should talk

about the City.

23
24

Yes, we are.

MR. BEITLER:

And then we have the

City.

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company

CHAIRMAN BELL:

certain amount of detail to reimburse.

4

The City requires a

MR. BEITLER:

The City requires so much

MS. FUNCHES:

I have to submit a

detail.

5
6

voucher to the City of all costs.

7

scrutinized.

8
9

CHAIRMAN BELL:

It's very

Is there someone from

the City here that could talk to that?

10

MS. FUNCHES:

Did Scott leave?

11

MR. YONOVER:

No, I'm here.

12

CHAIRMAN BELL:

What do you think,

13

Scott?

14

system here in terms of --

15

Do we have a pretty good close looped

MR. YONOVER:

We're always finetuning

16

it.

I mean, Vivian submits it.

17

people in our grant department that review the

18

bills, and there are some that are kicked back

19

and then Vivian will resubmit.

20

as best we can in a timely manner.

21

when she submits the receipts upon receipt of

22

her receiving them.

23
24

CHAIRMAN BELL:

We've got

We try to do it
It helps

I guess the real

question is, do we think we have an adequate

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company
www.veritext.com

312-346-0911

 Page 16
1

check and balance here?

2

really.

3

MR. BEITLER:

David is asking that

Oh, I think we have a

4

solid gold check and balance.

5

checks and balances than any normal corporation

6

would have.

7

CHAIRMAN BELL:

8

MS. FUNCHES:

9

We have way more

Okay.
Anymore questions on this

statement?

10

(No response.)

11

The next statement is the budget

12

overview.

13

the period ending September the 30th of

14

$1,088,000 and actual of 636,000 compared to the

15

prior year actual at the same time $325,000.

16

The chart on the right shows the components that

17

make up those costs.

18

The first column shows our budget for

The chart in the middle shows our

19

budget as of December the 31st at $1,445,000

20

which we're forecasting to finish at $995,000

21

compared to prior year of $835,000.

22

CHAIRMAN BELL:

So how does that

23

compare with the funding available from the

24

City?

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company
www.veritext.com

312-346-0911

 Page 17
1
2

MR. BEITLER:

The forecast is in line

with the funding available from the City.

3

MR. HOFFMAN:

Steve, the only thing of

4

note on this chart is that if you look at the

5

full year chart, the professional fees, the

6

expenses have been about double what was

7

budgeted over by about $200,000.

8

explain what the increase was from?

9

MR. BEITLER:

Can you just

The issue is that we are

10

slow to hire so we used more part-time employees

11

than full-time employees.

12
13

CHAIRMAN BELL:

So job shop was

contract labor?

14

MS. FUNCHES:

Exactly.

15

MR. BEITLER:

Contract labor.

16

CHAIRMAN BELL:

17

MR. BEITLER:

18

They're not hired.
No, I'm sorry, not

employees, contract labor versus employees.

19

MR. HOFFMAN:

This is not a reflection

20

of hiring -- increased fees for hiring

21

additional law firms or audit firms or more

22

expenses relating to those, instead it relates

23

to individuals who were instead employees

24

contracted -- independent contractors?

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company
www.veritext.com

312-346-0911

 Page 18
1

MR. BEITLER:

2

CHAIRMAN BELL:

That's correct.
You might in the future

3

break that out because that's a different

4

category really.

5

but that's a different category of costs.

6
7

That's kind of understandable,

MR. BEITLER:

Break out the independent

contractors?

8

MR. HOFFMAN:

Sure.

Call it

9

professional fees.

It probably miscommunicates

10

that a little bit.

It's logical from sort of

11

not extending the categories too far, but I

12

think it's right because it will create question

13

along the lines of the one I asked I think.

14

MR. BEITLER:

We'll do that.

15

MS. FUNCHES:

Anymore questions?

16

CHAIRMAN BELL:

17

MR. BEITLER:

No.
All right.

Moving from

18

the budget, we'll start our project updates, and

19

so first we'll go through the project matrix and

20

then onto some specific discussions about

21

projects, some of which have resolutions

22

associated with them, some of which have

23

discussion and executive session, and then some

24

of which we'll complete discussion in open

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company
www.veritext.com

312-346-0911

 Page 19
1

session, and we'll let you know about each of

2

those as we go through it.

3

So these are inactive ideas at the

4

moment.

5

a number of them.

6

that ideas that might be on this chart can come

7

off and go back on to one of the active charts

8

which is the case right now with solar which

9

Claire will talk about.

10

We won't dwell on this.

There's quite

I just would remind the Board

These are the approved or proposed

11

initiatives at this point in time, and we'll go

12

through many of these initiatives in more detail

13

as the meeting progresses.

14

Then here are some of the potential

15

projects that we are exploring and we will bring

16

before the Board in the not too distant future

17

if they pan out as --

18
19

CHAIRMAN BELL:
those things that --

20
21

Project D and B, are

MR. BEITLER:

We'll discuss those in

the executive session.

22

CHAIRMAN BELL:

All right.

23

MR. BEITLER:

So I'd like to ask --

24

MR. HOFFMAN:

Can you go back?

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company

312-346-0911

 Page 20
1

MR. BEITLER:

Yes, of course.

2

MR. HOFFMAN:

The 4G pedway, I don't

3

know if we're going to discuss that later today.

4

MR. BEITLER:

No.

5

MR. HOFFMAN:

That's the same thing

6

that was discussed previously,

7

MR. BEITLER:

Yes.

So basically what

8

we will discuss today is the 4G CTA project, and

9

as a result of doing the 4G CTA project, it's

10

become clear that there are some other cellular

11

oriented projects that will be beneficial to the

12

City, that the City would like to have done and

13

that the carriers would like to do, and for

14

whatever reason we haven't done -- have not done

15

them to this point.

16

In the case of the pedway, there's

17

no old cellular system down there; whereas, in

18

the case of the CTA, there was a 2G system.

19

it looks like it could be a great project and

20

for anybody who uses the pedway particularly in

21

the winter.

22

MR. HOFFMAN:

So

Is that something that we

23

can -- you all can drive the bus on, not to be

24

cute, or are we really -- I think on the tunnel

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company

312-346-0911

 Page 21
1

system, we were helping to facilitate it,

2

although it was really the CT and the wireless

3

companies that were driving forward.

4

What's your perspective on whether

5

we can push on that one or whether we just have

6

to follow the CTA and the wireless companies?

7

MR. BEITLER:

Well, I think actually

8

when you look at what we've done with 4G for the

9

CTA, the Trust has actually driven it forward in

10

terms of how it's going to be financed.

11

And in the case of the 4G pedway,

12

there is no owner like the CTA for the pedway,

13

so I think the Trust would be in the position of

14

driving it forward on a number of different

15

levels, and those are to be determined because

16

you have buildings, the basements of which are

17

in the pedway and the City owns the pedway

18

thoroughfare, but then there are buildings that

19

abut it, and there's some legal things that we

20

have to work out which we haven't fully worked

21

out yet in terms of who knows what to do.

22

But the Trust would drive that

23

entire project given that there's no specific

24

owner like there is in the train system.

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Just to be clear,

2

David, we haven't really talked about this yet.

3

I mean, I think it's --

4

MR. HOFFMAN:

5

I remember it being mentioned.

6
7

CHAIRMAN BELL:

It's just an idea where

we have talked about it on the CTA.

8
9

I think it was mentioned.

MR. BEITLER:

And we're really waiting

to finish the 4G for the CTA before we move onto

10

another cellular project.

11

we do this frankly, cellular on streetlights as

12

part of the streetlights project will probably

13

be the next cellular project.

14

I think that before

I would like to ask Mike Mirretti to

15

come and just talk about the Chicago

16

contemporary bungalow briefly.

17

MR. MIRRETTI:

So to summarize, the

18

Trust examined affordable housing in the City of

19

Chicago, performed qualitative and quantitative

20

analysis, and really the bottom line is down in

21

the key learnings area and the implications, and

22

where we netted out is housing that looks like

23

the last resort stigmatizes residents and

24

discourages them.

So we could fundamentally

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company
www.veritext.com

312-346-0911

 Page 23
1

make it work financially, but we have some other

2

obstacles that we need to overcome.

3

So, Steve, do you want to go to the

4

next one?

5

project, people involved, who we talked with.

6

We talked to several people across the city,

7

including Tom Villanova.

8
9

So at the top summarizes the overall

But at the end of the day the key
finding was, like I said, financially we can

10

make this work, it was just really the stigma of

11

what it looked like.

12

So it is an inactive project, but we

13

are talking to a couple of individuals to do an

14

architectural study and engaging in a couple of

15

different firms on what those might look like

16

and then go back out and get the feedback from,

17

you know, community and than reignite that

18

project, if it makes sense.

19

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Just so I understand

20

what we're talking about, Mike, this has taken

21

all the vacant property the City has, working

22

with them to put affordable housing on it is

23

kind of what we're talking about?

24

MR. MIRRETTI:

Right.

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company
www.veritext.com

312-346-0911

 Page 24
1

MR. BEITLER:

That's correct.

I think

2

ultimately what we can do and have some interest

3

in it is creating a design competition among the

4

architecture -- there's about five universities

5

in the city and surrounding areas that have

6

architecture departments and basically create a

7

competition so that we could perhaps see if the

8

students could come up with good looking designs

9

at the correct price for the concept that does

10

work financially but just doesn't work from an

11

aesthetic standpoint at this point.

12

So we think maybe by engaging the

13

architecture faculties in the various

14

universities we might be able to hit the price

15

as well as the aesthetic point, in which case we

16

can go back and look at this as a project for

17

purposes of utilizing underutilized property.

18

MR. HOFFMAN:

Let me express a

19

tentative opinion about this.

20

fantastic to figure out a way to have the Trust

21

be a vehicle that helps increase affordable

22

housing.

23
24

So it would be

I see that part of the point here,
and the slide before is the innovative use of

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company
www.veritext.com

312-346-0911

 Page 25
1

containerized housing could create attractive

2

homes at a price lower than traditional

3

stick-built housing.

4

I see in the next slide the key

5

finding, although it may be possible to do that,

6

the resulting homes would not be desirable to

7

residents in terms of design and neighborhood

8

fit.

9

maybe, right?

So maybe that's why it's inactive.

10

It's a

My comment is that there's no way

11

that we and you all will be housing experts,

12

right?

13

with some people, but the people at the CHA, at

14

HUD and in the variety of not-for-profit places

15

who have been working on these issues for

16

decades are truly experts in this.

17

And I see that you have, Mike, consulted

MR. BEITLER:

We've consulted actually

18

with perhaps hundreds of people, not just two or

19

three.

20

MR. HOFFMAN:

Okay.

Well, then that

21

was my question.

I saw the action thing.

I

22

think that that -- if it feels stuck, maybe one

23

thing that might be helpful for the Trust to do

24

would be to have some sort of a public -- I

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company
www.veritext.com

312-346-0911

 Page 26
1

mean, really not with the Board but really staff

2

running some sort of public panel discussion and

3

hearing with a panel of experts to flush that

4

out, and you might have a result after that that

5

sort of moves its way forward, might create some

6

momentum.

7

I'm a little dubious that if it's

8

internal, the Trust sort of driving this, it

9

will be looked at with cynicism because while we

10

can bring financing expertise, we're not going

11

to know whether this containerized housing is

12

going to be acceptable or desirable for

13

residents or otherwise.

14

But I don't want to throw cold water

15

on it because I think if we can figure out a way

16

forward, it would be a very positive thing for

17

the City.

18

MR. BEITLER:

I think that might be

19

something we would do in conjunction with the

20

design competition to get both perspectives, but

21

just to make sure everybody understands, we've

22

actually talked with hundreds of experts and

23

come up with a pretty good financial model.

24

The problem is at this point

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company
www.veritext.com

312-346-0911

 Page 27
1

aesthetic, it's not financial.

It's more of a

2

design issue how can you produce a good

3

aesthetic design at the right price point.

4

so some of the things that may seem peculiar but

5

drive this are if you have to pay Kohler for a

6

sink and you have to pay Kohler's margin, it

7

starts to price you out of the ballpark, so how

8

can you provide that sink without buying it from

9

Kohler, and I'm just using Kohler as an example,

And

10

so hence the desire to go to a competition with

11

the architecture student teams because they

12

might be able to say use sheet stainless steel

13

to produce what we need without having to go to

14

a manufacturer to do it which would reduce the

15

cost of those particular items that would bring

16

down the overall cost but provide an

17

aesthetically pleasing solution.

18

So those are the kinds of things

19

that we would consider in a design competition.

20

I think doing what you described, using actually

21

a lot of the experts that we've already talked

22

to in addition to the design competition might

23

be a very good thing.

24

MR. HOFFMAN:

One other thought.

I

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company
www.veritext.com

312-346-0911

 Page 28
1

won't dwell on this.

2

But for you and Mike, if you've talked to

3

hundreds of experts, you've gained a substantial

4

amount of expertise that you all are discussing

5

internally and maybe in terms of architecture

6

design.

7

I know we have to move on.

Another thing to do is write it up,

8

write up a paper that summarizes it, put it on

9

the website and send it around the world to

10

people and solicit ideas and thoughts.

11
12

We are doing that

MR. HOFFMAN:

Good.

actually.

13
14

MR. BEITLER:

that.

So tell me about

What's going to happen with that?

15

MR. BEITLER:

We're pulling together an

16

after action report, if you will, it's my

17

military terminology, but essentially describing

18

the process that we went through, what the

19

results were, what the findings were, pros and

20

cons, et cetera into one paper which we will

21

eventually put on the website.

22

MR. HOFFMAN:

Yeah, and I would do

23

whatever you can to publish that.

I mean, one

24

of the best things I think of the last year is

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company
www.veritext.com

312-346-0911

 Page 29
1

the instances where you and the staff have used

2

the Trust as a vehicle to collect innovative

3

ideas.

4

innovative ideas but collecting innovative ideas

5

from the world.

6

I mean, you all are generating a lot of

This sounds like you, you know,

7

collected a lot of information.

8

out and publicize it the right way, maybe it

9

sucks in other innovative ideas that can unlock

10

If you put it

the solution here.

11

So, anyway, I would say keep it up.

12

It's hard to see where this might go, but it

13

might go somewhere.

14

MR. BEITLER:

15
16

Thank you.

All right.

Turning to energy.

Claire?

17

MS. TRAMM:

18

Thank you.

Retrofit 1 is on track.

As you can

19

see, we have sort of two phases of installation,

20

both design development, permitting and approval

21

which are largely completed at this juncture,

22

and then we have also begun the construction

23

phase on about 11 of our projects or 11 percent

24

of our projects, and then the work that's

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company
www.veritext.com

312-346-0911

 Page 30
1

already been performed represents about a fifth

2

of the total work that we expect to be performed

3

in terms of dollar value.

4

We have some scope changes that

5

include City Hall's chiller program.

6

redesigned to have more redundancy.

7

unit were to fail at any time, this provides

8

more -- this new design provides more

9

redundancy, and the costs for the project were

10

increased accordingly about 300k which 2FM has

11

decided to pay those additional increased costs,

12

and then that will result in additional savings

13

of about $11,000 per year for the City.

14

That was
In case one

So that is not going to result in

15

any changes to the financing documents but will

16

just change the Project Service Agreements with

17

the ESCOs.

18

So I think that's about it for the

19

overall update.

20

here.

21

a number of photos.

22

over to him to talk you through this.

He's our project manager.

23
24

George Maltezos from the PBC is
He has sent me

I'm happy to turn the floor

We have basically three highlights
that we wanted to share with you about great

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company
www.veritext.com

312-346-0911

 Page 31
1

feedback we're getting about the actual quality

2

of life, if you will, within the building that

3

are getting upgrades.

4

So, George, if you just wanted to

5

maybe say a few words about Harold Washington,

6

the Police Academy and the other 2FM training.

7

MR. MALTEZOS:

Sure.

Harold Washington

8

Library, as some people may or may not know, is

9

unique in many ways, one of which is that it is

10

heated by its lights, so with the exception of

11

the winter garden on the 9th Floor, all the heat

12

in that building is provided by the light

13

fixtures, and it has significant volume and mass

14

in that it maintains its temperature from the

15

lights.

16

So the ESCOs looked at it and

17

decided that there was an opportunity to reduce

18

the wattage of the lights and still maintain the

19

heat output that the building needs.

20

When we went to implement this

21

significant lighting change, light bulb change,

22

if you will, it came to everyone's understanding

23

that over the years that the power source to all

24

the lights has degraded.

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company
www.veritext.com

312-346-0911

 Page 32
1

The ballast system has this little

2

thing called a capacitor, and if you look at the

3

picture on the before, you'll see that there's

4

all different colored lights going on.

5

green and some are dim and some are bright, and

6

over time the library has kind of just lived

7

with it because it's been so gradual a change

8

that they've never really noticed it.

9

There's

When they went in to install the new

10

lights, they really didn't work well.

11

kind of a dingy green color instead of the light

12

that we had anticipated.

13

when we changed out these little components

14

called capacitors, on the right-hand side all

15

the lights lit up bright and white like they

16

were originally intended to back in 1990.

17

They were

So we did a test and

So this has created a great deal of

18

excitement at the library because now they are

19

actually going to have lighting.

20

CHAIRMAN BELL:

21

the library now.

22
23

You can read a book in

MR. MALTEZOS:

Yeah.

So they're quite

excited about this.

24

CHAIRMAN BELL:

But also this is less

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company
www.veritext.com

312-346-0911

 Page 33
1

energy to drive this lighting system.

2

MR. MALTEZOS:

Yes, it's about 35 watts

3

less per fixture on an average and over 6,000

4

bulbs, that adds up to some real money.

5

CHAIRMAN BELL:

6

MR. MALTEZOS:

Yeah.
Anyway, so 2FM has

7

approved the change to upgrade the capacitors,

8

if you will.

9

own, not through the ESCOs, and once that work

They're going to do that on their

10

is performed, it will be performed

11

coincidentally by the same person who's changing

12

the bulbs, so it will happen within the same

13

time.

14

Our hope is within the next two

15

months when you walk into Harold Washington

16

Library, it will be whiter and brighter and much

17

easier to read in, and that's going to be a

18

significant change, plus the benefit of saving

19

the energy.

20

ALDERMAN POPE:

You know, that's great,

21

the outcome.

It just seems odd that that

22

problem wasn't identified earlier.

23

something that we're looking at moving forward

24

that beyond replacing the bulbs themselves that

Is that

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company
www.veritext.com

312-346-0911

 Page 34
1

the actual system, the ballast, wouldn't be part

2

of the overall solution?

3

MR. MALTEZOS:

That's a fair question.

4

We brought in -- believe me, when we first

5

started putting in the new bulbs and they all

6

came out green, everyone was scratching their

7

heads and saying what's going on here so we

8

brought in the experts from Philips and Sylvania

9

and they really assessed it.

10

And what they realized is like many

11

buildings, they replace things when they go bad,

12

not when they go kind of bad, and so they've

13

been kind of limping along with replacing

14

ballasts when they actually failed and the

15

lights go out, but if they're dim or a different

16

color, there really isn't that much maintenance

17

that's going on.

18

So technically there should have

19

been some kind of overall ballast revamp on a

20

periodic basis that didn't happen so that's why

21

we ended up with where we are today.

22

ALDERMAN POPE:

But based on this

23

moving forward, we'll know better, use it as a

24

best practice to look at the structural system,

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company
www.veritext.com

312-346-0911

 Page 35
1

not just the fixture itself?

2

MR. MALTEZOS:

Yes.

The fixtures

3

themselves are a little different than what you

4

would find in the typical city building, so the

5

ballasts associated with a conventional strip

6

fluorescent is really different than these

7

pendant fixtures.

8
9

They are giant ballasts.

They weigh

about 25 pounds, and they are hidden up in the

10

ceiling.

11

what you normally encounter with a fluorescent

12

bulb.

These are metal halide bulbs.

13
14

It's a little different animal than

ALDERMAN POPE:

Oh.

Very good.

Thank

you.

15

MR. MALTEZOS:

16

MR. BEITLER:

Sure.
I also think the answer

17

to your question is that we are looking at the

18

ballasts everywhere.

19

bit surprised because it's different from what

20

we traditionally look at.

21

I think we were a little

Next slide.

22

MR. MALTEZOS:

So this is another kind

23

of example of the kind of work that we're doing

24

across the City.

Currently there's 116 projects

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company
www.veritext.com

312-346-0911

 Page 36
1

as part of Retrofit 1.

2

of them I would say, and generally speaking

3

everywhere we've gone, people are pleasantly

4

surprised at the results.

5

We're through about 40

Either they have better control of

6

the space that they work in or they have better

7

lighting, and so we've been getting kind of just

8

unsolicited notes of appreciation, and one of

9

them came from the Police Training Academy,

10

which is a large facility, and we kind of

11

installed occupancy sensors and did some

12

relamping there and everyone is thrilled with

13

the outcome.

14

CHAIRMAN BURKE:

But better lighting

15

and more efficient energy costs, I want to make

16

sure we're getting that too.

17

MR. MALTEZOS:

Everything we're doing

18

is a self-funded project, so every penny that we

19

spend on this is paid for from the energy

20

savings, and the good news is that we're getting

21

a lot of kind of additional benefits such as

22

that really we're not quantifying necessarily

23

but that are accruing to the city.

24

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Good.

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company
www.veritext.com

312-346-0911

 Page 37
1

MS. TRAMM:

I'm sure Steve would love

2

to say how much better the lighting was in the

3

shooting range.

4
5

He can practice there.

ALDERMAN POPE:

He didn't shoot you

you're saying.

6

MS. TRAMM:

Yes.

7

CHAIRMAN BELL:

I don't know if that's

8

good or bad.

The lighting isn't treated that

9

good, is it?

They need real kind of lighting.

10

MR. MALTEZOS:

Another kind of benefit

11

that accrues to the City is we're introducing

12

new technologies that are designed to control

13

and adapt environment through the context and

14

safe energy in the meantime, and as part of that

15

effort, we're training 2FM operating engineers

16

on these new technologies, so that's additional

17

benefit.

18

So this example is from the Pershing

19

warehouse project we just completed.

20

giant 600,000 square foot warehouse on Pershing

21

Road, and it's very well lit, and we installed

22

occupancy sensors throughout to shut everything

23

down when there's nobody present.

24

It's a

So this what you see is a training

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company
www.veritext.com

312-346-0911

 Page 38
1

by a manufacturer's representative from Lutron

2

showing them the newest products that are

3

available in wireless lighting controls, and

4

these are all the City's electricians around the

5

table learning about this.

6

benefit that is happening that would not have

7

happened if this project didn't occur.

8
9

MR. HOFFMAN:
here.

So it's again a

George, I'm glad you're

It's nice to have in front of us someone

10

who knows -- who's really an expert in the

11

City's building inventory, and it's nice to hear

12

these very positive benefits.

13

I mean, I was wondering if you could

14

just assess for us a little more globally with

15

Retrofit 1 along the lines of the comments

16

you're making about the positive effects it's

17

having at the library and Police Academy and so

18

on, how you would assess what the positive

19

impact will be.

20

I mean, is this going to have a

21

significant positive impact or is it really just

22

a blip that doesn't really change things in the

23

every day life of City employees, residents who

24

are getting services there, students, teachers

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company
www.veritext.com

312-346-0911

 Page 39
1

and so on?

How do we assess the significance of

2

it?

3

because you know the buildings so well.

You may be one of the people best situated

4

MR. MALTEZOS:

My opinion, and again

5

we'll prove it out by April of next year, my

6

opinion is that the benefits are really going

7

to -- in addition to saving a million and a half

8

dollars a year, which is not insignificant but

9

it's a real savings, I think what we're learning

10

from this project is that yes, we're saving

11

energy but we're also kind of modernizing

12

buildings by making these kind of energy related

13

capital improvements that otherwise wouldn't

14

have been done.

15

And I think what it's affording 2FM,

16

who operates all these buildings, is better

17

control.

18

resources in engineers operating all these

19

buildings and so now we're going to have a lot

20

more, let's say 40 additional buildings that now

21

have computerized building automation systems

22

which means that rather than -- if a library is

23

experiencing a temperature problem, rather than

24

having an engineer drive out there, they will be

So they have somewhat limited

able to log onto a computer and see what's

2

happening in that library before they actually

3

make the trip.

4

That's an efficiency gain that is

5

part of 2FM's overall plan that now they're

6

getting a jump for.

7

connected into a globalized building monitoring

8

system is a big step in that direction.

9

All these buildings being

I think that those are the kinds of

10

things that you're going to see.

11

up changing the big pieces of equipment with the

12

exception of City Hall and a couple other

13

places.

14

We did not end

The deeper retrofits that we had

15

hoped for didn't really materialize, but we did

16

get better control of the buildings, both in

17

lighting and in HVAC control.

18

be a benefit.

19

MR. HOFFMAN:

That's going to

So let me just make one

20

followup comment.

21

addition to the savings, there are these other

22

tangible benefits.

23

the modernization benefits.

24

It was my sense that in

You described in some detail

There clearly are benefits for the

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company
www.veritext.com

312-346-0911

 Page 41
1

people who use these buildings, employees and

2

residents, and so on.

3

or was it 5 million?

4

of this?

5

MS. TRAMM:

6

MR. HOFFMAN:

Claire, was it 12 million
What was the total value

13 million.
13 million.

So can you

7

go back briefly to the matrix slide?

8

really matter which one, the one that's approved

9

or proposed.

10

It doesn't

I know that -- I want to make a

comment about this and then move it along.

11

I know that on the X axis here, the

12

net fees generated we've had discussion in the

13

past, and I know I've heard from you, that

14

paying attention to projects that are really on

15

the high side of net fees generated is

16

important.

17

MR. BEITLER:

Let me just, if I may,

18

interrupt you for one second.

19

slide is configured the way it is is because

20

we're talking to the Board at the moment.

21

The reason this

If the staff was talking or the

22

Board was talking to the public, we might

23

configure the axises differently for a different

24

discussion, but this is a Board meeting and the

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company
www.veritext.com

312-346-0911

 Page 42
1

staff is talking to the Board, hence the reason

2

why that axis is what it is.

3

MR. HOFFMAN:

Okay.

And obviously

4

Municipal Retrofit is up in the top left in part

5

because it had high project complexity and, you

6

know, I have a perspective on two things.

7

One, my guess is if we did other

8

similar projects of the size of Municipal

9

Retrofit, either similar to Retrofit or somewhat

10

different, it's going to be significantly less

11

complex.

12

MR. BEITLER:

The Aquatics Centers

13

would be a good example of what you're

14

describing.

15

MR. HOFFMAN:

Partly because it's the

16

first one and now there's a model and both the

17

procedural stuff and the substantive stuff was

18

done.

19

complex.

So even the smaller ones will be less

20

If you go to the next slide, so I

21

note that all our potential initiatives are in

22

the high fees area.

23

about the benefit at times of small projects.

24

think this is a good example of it.

I want to make a comment
I

I want to

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company
www.veritext.com

312-346-0911

 Page 43
1

just make sure from the staff perspective that

2

we're not losing sight of the potentially huge

3

benefits of small projects.

4

There was a great book by some

5

economic's professors a couple years ago called

6

Nudge that talked about the benefits of small

7

incremental steps by government and others that

8

can make a huge difference.

9

need something small.

10

Sometimes you just

You know, I think hearing from

11

George and seeing these examples, it's a

12

relatively small amount of money that I think is

13

getting a much greater amount of impact.

14
15

So I would like to see -- I think
it's relevant to --

16

MR. BEITLER:

So I --

17

MR. HOFFMAN:

Let me finish.

18

I think it's relevant to think about

19

fees generated.

Having financial independence

20

as a trust is an important goal.

21

that.

22

exclusion of potentially smaller projects which

23

probably can be managed efficiently going

24

forward because they can make a huge difference

I agree with

I don't think that that should be to the

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company
www.veritext.com

312-346-0911

 Page 44
1

on the ground for people in the city.

2

MR. BEITLER:

So we completely agree

3

with you.

4

elaborate on your point.

5

There is two points I would make to

One of the reasons we have the

6

inactive page is because there are some great

7

projects in the lower left-hand quadrant, but we

8

just can't afford to do them necessarily right

9

now because we would have to provide funding for

10

them and we don't have that money to provide it

11

at the moment.

12

So they are in lower left-hand

13

quadrant, but they provide a civic purpose that

14

is what you're describing, and we shouldn't

15

forget about that civic purpose, but we have to

16

have money to be able to fund that civic

17

purpose, and we're not quite there yet.

18

The second point if you go to the

19

middle slide, Claire, is the PACE project, which

20

Claire will discuss briefly today.

21

essentially provides a programatic envelope for

22

doing individual projects.

PACE

23

That to your very point is one of

24

the things that makes PACE so valuable is the

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company
www.veritext.com

312-346-0911

 Page 45
1

fact that instead of waiting to aggregate -- how

2

many projects, George, are in Retrofit 1?

3

MR. MALTEZOS:

4

MR. BEITLER:

5

116.
Thank you.

So instead of waiting to aggregate

6

116 projects, we can, in fact, do them

7

individually as they occur through a PACE

8

umbrella and finance them individually, but at

9

the same rate that we're financing all 116

10

projects; hence being able to do things on a

11

very individual basis as opposed to waiting to

12

do these massive aggregations which got very

13

high fees, et cetera.

14

So I think that really gets to, from

15

an energy project standpoint, the heart of what

16

you're describing because we have a mechanism to

17

do projects individually but under a program

18

umbrella.

19

So I think PACE is really important

20

for what you're describing, and Claire will get

21

into that further on a couple of slides.

22
23

MR. HOFFMAN:

Thank you.

Thank you,

George.

24

MS. TRAMM:

So I'd like to also cover

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company
www.veritext.com

312-346-0911

 Page 46
1

some of the other energy projects that we have

2

in flight which there are many, so I'll try and

3

be brief, but please let me know if you have any

4

questions.

5

First solar.

We have some

6

interesting activity on that front that's

7

largely being driven by the fact that the

8

Illinois market for solar renewable energy

9

credits is worth about 30 million and was

10

established this summer for bid into an auction

11

for essentially rebates that will make solar

12

cost effective in Illinois on an individual

13

project basis, so there will be an auction to

14

see who gets pieces of that 30 million.

15

That will be Q2 of next year, so

16

there's a lot of activity right now being driven

17

around preparing for that auction and trying to

18

get one's bids in.

19

activities on that front.

20

So we have a couple

One is that we are joining with

21

several environmental NGOs to put in a request

22

for what's called a community solar or a

23

community solar garden pilot, whereby, residents

24

and businesses that may not have the ideal sort

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company
www.veritext.com

312-346-0911

 Page 47
1

of roof or land space on which to place solar

2

can instead buy the electrons or buy shares from

3

a larger solar project that is off-site

4

somewhere.

5

So that's a very unique structure

6

which we're supporting and we think we could be

7

very helpful in financing if that were to be

8

approved as part of that market.

9

Oh, then I should mention we're

10

also looking at several landfill and brownfield

11

sites that could be used for that community

12

solar pilot.

13
14

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Would that be property

that the City owns that we would build this on?

15

MS. TRAMM:

It would essentially be

16

solar brownfields.

17

potentially City owned, and then the other is

18

privately owned, but then would be like deeded

19

to the Trust.

20

One of them would be

So they are brownfield sites in that

21

they are at rest landfills or other damaged

22

sites which have no potential use other than for

23

something like this.

24

good story about how we can renew the use of

So I think it's a really

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company
www.veritext.com

312-346-0911

 Page 48
1

land that otherwise would just remain at rest.

2

The second thing we're doing is

3

starting to approach some of the City

4

departments and sister agencies which we think

5

might make for good hosts for behind the meter

6

solar projects; meaning, they would be on the

7

rooftops of these sorts of buildings and would

8

essentially serve the local buildings load and

9

be a net metered but commercial scale project.

10

So we hope to have a few of those to also bid

11

into that 2015 SREC market.

12

On the PACE side, we have drafted

13

the City ordinance.

14

question.

15

Oh, go ahead, Steve, a

MR. SILVERS:

Just on the solar.

I

16

mean, the Chicago area is a large center of

17

distribution centers and other buildings with

18

very large roofs.

19

that potential working roof owners of those

20

buildings on this project?

21
22

MS. TRAMM:

We have not yet, although

those are mostly privately held.

23
24

Have you all looked at all of

MR. SILVERS:

I know they are privately

held.

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company
www.veritext.com

312-346-0911

 Page 49
1

MS. TRAMM:

And I believe there are

2

many solar developers who are approaching them

3

given the frenzy of activity that this market

4

has created.

5

MR. SILVERS:

I mean, if we're not

6

competitive in that, it doesn't make sense to

7

spend time on it.

8

MS. TRAMM:

9

ALDERMAN POPE:

10

Exactly.
Claire, can I just

clarify?

11

So the City's assets include the

12

Jardin plant, for example, a larger spot that

13

you just mentioned.

14

the opportunities for that or what is happening

15

with those?

16

MS. TRAMM:

So again can you clarify

So usually what happens is

17

that for -- I guess the second point I made

18

which is we're looking for rooftops that could

19

be great behind the meter solar PB hosts.

20

You're looking at both the structural ability of

21

that roof to hold up the weight of the panels,

22

and I know that there have been one or two

23

studies of El Jardin.

24

Everyone looks at that roof and goes

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company
www.veritext.com

312-346-0911

 Page 50
1

this would be perfect, but it is actually not

2

structurally as sound as you would think to be

3

able to hold up that much weight and the snow.

4

So that's unfortunate.

5

But I think what we're looking for

6

is, you know, which roofs are best suited for

7

it.

8

development activities in schools and park

9

district facilities where it was determined, so

10

we're just starting that now and, you know, the

11

deadline being Q2 of next year so we have plenty

12

of time to filter through our building inventory

13

and find the right ones.

I think there may have been some past

14

ALDERMAN POPE:

Can I suggest, not to

15

be selfish, we just had a meeting in the 10th

16

Ward regarding a new elementary school that's

17

going up, so with the PBC being here, those are

18

great opportunities as we're developing new

19

structures to incorporate the required

20

structural integrity for panels like this.

21

MS. TRAMM:

Absolutely, yeah.

I think

22

the new build portfolio would be ideal because

23

you can build it correct the first time.

24

ALDERMAN POPE:

Thank you.

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company
www.veritext.com

312-346-0911

 Page 51
1

MS. TRAMM:

Okay.

So I'll just give

2

you a quick update on PACE as well.

3

the last time we spoke about this was the

4

summertime and we had received 15 separate

5

responses from 15 separate entities to our open

6

bidding process on the website, including 12

7

financiers, and what we realized is that because

8

of the structure of the very broad state

9

enabling legislation for PACE, it's literally a

10

paragraph long, very brief, and the openness of

11

that legislation to interpretation by

12

financiers, we felt that it was the most prudent

13

choice to draft our city ordinance that we are

14

proposing to introduce to City Council and have

15

that ordinance reviewed by all of the financiers

16

who have responded to our open bidding process

17

with interest in financing this program and have

18

their lawyers take a look at whether they would

19

truly be interested in financing it were such an

20

ordinance to be passed, what comments and

21

questions they might have or adjustments they

22

suggest.

23
24

I believe

So we're in the process of this week
sending out to all of those respondents the

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company
www.veritext.com

312-346-0911

 Page 52
1

ordinance draft as well as a list of followup

2

questions to all of those open bidding

3

respondents which has been characteristic of our

4

open bidding process for previous procurements,

5

and then in about three weeks, four weeks, we'll

6

expect answers back from everyone.

7

If we find that we have at last one

8

financier that is interested in backing such a

9

program were an ordinance to be passed, we will

10

proceed to introduce that to City Council; and,

11

if not, then we know we need further action at

12

the State level and it can't really be done at

13

the City level.

14

MR. HOFFMAN:

I have some questions

15

about that.

16

think behind the City ordinance.

17

if you can say a little bit more about it.

18

I understand the thought process I
I'm wondering

So I understand the theory how an

19

overly broad State statute might not be specific

20

enough to give you -- allow you to get proper

21

bids from vendors and give them sufficient

22

guidance.

23
24

I take it that's the point.
Maybe you could say a little bit

more about what you hope to accomplish with an

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company
www.veritext.com

312-346-0911

 Page 53
1

ordinance, what the sort of outlines of the

2

provisions would be.

3

That's one.

And, two, is this an ordinance that

4

would be -- sometimes ordinances are passed that

5

relate to a specific contract.

6

ordinance that would be related to a specific

7

project or like a state statute, it would be in

8

place forever and so it could be used as the

9

City's PACE Program ordinance which is how I

10

Is this an

assumed it would be.

11

MR. BEITLER:

Before Claire answers,

12

just to make one point of clarity.

13

received excellent responses to our PACE

14

proposal, and the value of the financing in

15

those responses exceeded a billion dollars, so

16

we received excellent responses.

17

We actually

The next set of questions in this

18

procurement process relates to the fact that

19

comfort on the part of the financiers to ensure

20

that the legal format is in place to enable them

21

to lend comfortably and not be worried that

22

somewhere after they've made a loan something

23

will be challenged in that process.

24

CHAIRMAN BELL:

In terms of the payment

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company
www.veritext.com

312-346-0911

 Page 54
1

process going back to the tax system?

2
3

MR. BEITLER:
process, et cetera.

4
5

In terms of the payment

CHAIRMAN BELL:

So what does the City

ordinance do to help that?

6

MS. TRAMM:

Let me just be clear about

7

what the State legislation said and why the City

8

ordinance is necessary because I think I forget

9

to lay that foundation for you.

10

The City ordinance is designed to

11

establish the PACE Program.

12

particular contract or anything.

13

ordinance says that any city, any home rule

14

municipality or any county but only for the

15

jurisdiction that lies without -- outside of

16

that home rule municipality.

17

It's not a
But the State

So, you know, there's no overlap in

18

those two jurisdictions.

19

can establish at its own will a property

20

assessment mechanism for clean energy and energy

21

efficiency assessments.

22

They say either one

And so I think where the debate is

23

is, you know, is this assessment, in fact, a

24

property tax, and, you know, does that leave

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company
www.veritext.com

312-346-0911

 Page 55
1

us -- if we very clearly interpret it as such in

2

our ordinance and set it up for collections in

3

that manner, would it stand at any point in the

4

future to be challenged and thus invalidate, you

5

know, the financiers' claim on this senior lien

6

which they're placing through the property tax

7

system.

8

So it's ultimately the judgment of

9

potential financiers whether they would invest

10

given that structure being in place, but that is

11

why we have to have a City ordinance because all

12

we have right now is State enabling legislation

13

that says you can make one if you want, cities.

14

MR. SILVERS:

I raised this at the last

15

meeting.

16

is necessary to make the providers of PACE

17

financing comfortable makes a great deal of

18

sense to me.

19

What you've laid out in terms of what

This program exists to give certain

20

of these providers the energy financing that

21

they will, in fact, be paid, and a one paragraph

22

piece of state legislation will not do that, so

23

I -- that makes sense to me.

24

But as I raised last time, I want to

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company
www.veritext.com

312-346-0911

 Page 56
1

raise again with you all, we're unlikely to get

2

picked up here.

3

the energy -- for the energy improvements in the

4

structure that people are prepared to provide

5

that financing, we are unlikely to get picked up

6

here by building owners if we don't have some

7

understanding with the major providers of senior

8

financing in commercial real estate in the city.

9

Even if we have the financing,

This has been the problem with

10

commercial PACE nationwide.

11

haven't gotten the volume that we need is

12

because, I mean, is because of the irony that

13

you give that -- you give the energy lender that

14

certainty, the existing senior lender becomes

15

uncomfortable, so I wondered if we've made any

16

progress in trying to solve that problem.

17

MS. TRAMM:

The reason why we

So I'm happy to forward you

18

a report that was put together on reviewing the

19

state of the senior mortgage lender's

20

perspective towards PACE.

21

page report, and I like the way it approaches

22

it.

23
24

It's about a 20 or 30

It not only lists about 85 banks,
including (unintelligible) banks, who have now

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company
www.veritext.com

312-346-0911

 Page 57
1

approved PACE senior liens, but it explains the

2

reasons for their doing so, and in particular

3

the increase in net operating income seems to be

4

one of those because when you do something that

5

has energy savings benefits, it actually does

6

hit the bottom line and makes your clients --

7

your building -- tenants more able to pay.

8
9

And then, secondly, I would note
that the market, because you're starting to see

10

the approvals happen, the market itself is

11

changing, and so commercial building owners are

12

having negotiating ability with their mortgage

13

holders and saying well, if you don't want to

14

approve my PACE lien, I will take my mortgage

15

somewhere else to people who will, and so the

16

market is opening.

17

MR. BEITLER:

And the 11 top mortgage

18

lenders in this state have all at one point or

19

another now approved PACE financing elsewhere.

20

MS. TRAMM:

Yeah.

And we also got a

21

statement from the Illinois --

22

MR. BEITLER:

23

MS. TRAMM:

24

Bankers Association.
-- Bankers Association that

they are very much in support of commercial

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company
www.veritext.com

312-346-0911

 Page 58
1

PACE, to say nothing of residential PACE, but

2

very much in support of commercial.

3

MR. SILVERS:

I would just -- again it

4

sounds like you're engaging in this, but to the

5

extent that it's possible for you all to

6

actually be in contact with the major lenders,

7

you know, with their Chicago underwriters,

8

because you are framing the municipal statute,

9

or hoping to frame the municipal statute -- not

10

statute, the ordinance, you have the opportunity

11

to make sure that you --

12

MR. BEITLER:

We have done that since

13

our last discussion.

14

more all the time, but once we select our PACE

15

partners, which when we hear from them, they

16

will do that for us as well on a much broader

17

basis.

18
19

We are doing it more and

MR. SILVERS:

I mean, that's very good.

I'm pleased to hear that.

20

CHAIRMAN BELL:

I think the issue is

21

that in order for the bank to do that, you've

22

got to -- you have to show that the asset is

23

going to grow in value because of the investment

24

in PACE.

MS. TRAMM:

That's the net operating

income.

3

CHAIRMAN BELL:

That's what it's all

4

about.

5

saying we can't do that, particularly in the

6

commercial space, but, I mean, I think that's

7

the challenge and we got to make sure we keep

8

that in front of us and see, you know, how this

9

discussion goes, but at the end of the day

10

I mean, I think that's what -- I'm not

that's what it's going to boil down to.

11

You know, you'd be willing to give

12

up your senior position if the value of your

13

assets is rising and you're not as concerned

14

that the amount that you've mortgaged is not

15

going to be recoverable.

16

MR. BEITLER:

17

process step by step.

18

to happen though is that the mortgage lenders

19

will wind up being principals in the PACE

20

business and that their interests will be --

21
22

So we're taking this
I do think what's going

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Very well could be

aligned.

23

MR. BEITLER:

24

MS. TRAMM:

Right
And that's exactly what the

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company
www.veritext.com

312-346-0911

 Page 60
1

increased net operating income does is it

2

increases the value.

3

CHAIRMAN BELL:

4

MS. TRAMM:

Yeah.

Okay.

Exactly.

So Retrofit 2, quick

5

update there.

6

Chicago Public Schools to finish its final

7

engineering review of a list of hundreds and

8

hundreds of energy conservation measures that

9

have been suggested by Siemens after a very

10

thorough Phase 1 audit which I think you'll

11

recall was completely free and commitment free

12

from our side.

13

We are just now waiting for the

So once that's done, we'll then talk

14

about how we're going to proceed with both the

15

schools and park boards to pass through a

16

contingent investment grade audit.

17

more thorough, deeper and detailed engineering

18

review and full procurement cost analysis of

19

absolutely every possible measure, and then at

20

the end of that some may fall off due to cost

21

ineffectiveness, but I think we're on track for

22

Q4 review by both of their boards.

23
24

That's a

One thing I would mention is that we
found quite a bit of cost effective outdoor

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company
www.veritext.com

312-346-0911

 Page 61
1

lighting upgrades with the parks.

2

the pathway lights as well as stadium lights, so

3

basically all the pathway lights were

4

identified, 20,000 of those that were identified

5

as cost effective to be replaced along with, you

6

know, the interior of these buildings and the

7

pools and what have you.

8
9

They do all

We decided to put that and really
weave that in the streetlights project because

10

we think they are best treated as part of the

11

overall light grid network in the city, and so

12

that brings us to the last initiative,

13

streetlights.

14

MR. BEITLER:

And all of the Board

15

Members have a draft RFI at their desk which is

16

currently being circulated in the city.

17

MS. TRAMM:

So the streetlights RFI now

18

has been drafted and is being reviewed by all of

19

the relevant city departments and sister

20

agencies.

It is I think a very good draft.

21

It's modeled on an RFI that was put

22

out by the Washington D.C. streetcar initiative

23

that had extremely high levels of response, so

24

we took a cue and didn't reinvent the wheel but

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company
www.veritext.com

312-346-0911

 Page 62
1

based our format largely off of theirs with the

2

notable addition I think, which will be very

3

helpful, of essentially appending an Excel

4

spreadsheet so people can show the economics of

5

their proposed technologies.

6

So that will be I think very

7

interesting to get responses back after that's

8

issued hopefully sometime in the next few weeks.

9

CHAIRMAN BELL:

What does the RFI -- We

10

don't have time to read it sitting here.

11

is the RFI really asking for?

12

for?

13

MS. TRAMM:

What

What is it asking

It's calling for three

14

categories of responses.

15

efficient lighting, so LEDs are the things that

16

are coming down greatly in cost and have almost

17

plateaued in sort of the prices we'll see them

18

being offered at just in the last three to five

19

years.

20

One is for energy

The other thing I should mention is

21

that the City did a very thorough inventory of

22

its lighting last year, so we have all the key

23

components now I think to make an LED lighting

24

retrofit cost effective.

That's the first

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company
www.veritext.com

312-346-0911

 Page 63
1

category of responses we're soliciting.

2

The second is sort of the balance of

3

systems, so the poles, the wiring, the bases

4

that are holding up the lights, and we're

5

interested in if there's anything new out there

6

and cost effective because some of that

7

infrastructure is aging.

8
9

And then the third category of
responses we're asking for is really how do you

10

use streetlights as a platform or at the same

11

time that we're installing these LEDs, how can

12

we make them Wi-Fi enabled so we can all put

13

them on a larger network.

14

How can we potentially offer Wi-Fi

15

to the public through them?

16

cost effective ways to attach a video camera or

17

some other sensing or communications devices

18

right on the light bulb or right in the fixture

19

that we're installing?

20

What are the very

So how can we leverage this amount

21

of infrastructure upgrade in a way that both

22

contribute to public safety initiatives and

23

quality of life in the city, as well as just

24

making our operations smarter and more

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company
www.veritext.com

312-346-0911

 Page 64

efficient.

2

CHAIRMAN BELL:

3

MS. BARRETT:

Okay.
Quick question on that

4

third piece.

5

prior conversations that last section is less

6

directive, it's kind of a call for, tell us the

7

art, if possible?

8
9

If I recall correctly from our

MS. TRAMM:
ended.

Yes.

It's pretty open

We list things that we've heard of but

10

then we clearly say if you have any other ideas,

11

please respond to the RFI at this time because

12

we want to have essentially a phasing and

13

prioritization discussion at the same time with

14

all the city departments and sister agencies

15

that will be involved and planning a potentially

16

multiphase RFP process.

17

Unlike other RFIs, I think this one

18

we are truly going to be making some serious

19

decisions about how to plan for the procurement

20

of this whole system, so we really encourage

21

private sector players to respond, take the time

22

to respond to this RFI.

23

MS. BARRETT:

Thanks.

24

MR. HOFFMAN:

Claire, this RFI that you

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company
www.veritext.com

312-346-0911

 Page 65
1

gave us just went out yesterday?

2

MS. TRAMM:

It did not go out to the

3

public.

It went out to all of the city

4

departments and sister agencies for review.

5

MR. HOFFMAN:

6

likely dissemination?

7

MS. TRAMM:

What's the schedule for

The hope is we'll get

8

responses -- while it is budget season, we're

9

hoping that we'll get responses from all the

10

city departments and sister agencies from our

11

deadline for review next Wednesday, the 22nd,

12

and then we're hoping that by the week of the

13

27th we'll actually be disseminating it to the

14

public.

15

MR. HOFFMAN:

Great.

I see the

16

deadline to respond is November 15th.

17

thinking that that will stick?

18

MS. TRAMM:

19

MR. HOFFMAN:

20

MS. TRAMM:

Give it about a month,

Yeah, it will be about a

30-day response window.

23
24

It will probably shift.

end of November?

21
22

Are you

MR. HOFFMAN:

I see at the beginning

the Mayor's letter at the end it talks about the

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company
www.veritext.com

312-346-0911

 Page 66
1

central benefit of the prior project that you

2

would use the ESA, the Energy Services

3

Agreement, as the financing model.

4

very good.

5

It seems

My question is about where this is

6

fitting in, if you know, nationally.

My sense

7

of the use of the ESAs with Retrofit 1 and the

8

time that it took to get that was in part

9

because there wasn't a clear model that we could

10

rely on that's been used a lot around the

11

country, and there was some innovation in the

12

way that the ESAs were used in that model and

13

we're planning on doing the same thing here.

14

Has this now in the last 6 to

15

12 months become more frequently used?

16

commonly being used or are we still at the

17

vanguard, which means both it's a good thing to

18

be innovative in that way, but also that there's

19

not as much experience with using these in the

20

larger picture?

21
22

MS. TRAMM:

That's a really great

question.

23
24

Is this

MR. HOFFMAN:

It was a long question.

I appreciate the compliment.

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company
www.veritext.com

312-346-0911

 Page 67
1

MS. TRAMM:

2

MR. HOFFMAN:

3

me.

You never ask short ones.
Maybe it was short for

I don't really know.

4

MS. TRAMM:

I actually just spent

5

sometime yesterday with both the Chinese

6

building and government representatives who are

7

very interested in the use of the ESA model and

8

bringing that to China.

9

We've also got an interest from

10

Canadians, both city and provincial governments

11

about copying the use of the ESA model as well

12

as establishing an organization like the Trust,

13

and then we're also getting interest from other

14

Illinois municipal entities.

15

So I literally just had two calls

16

yesterday or gave two webinars presenting how

17

the Trust is structured, how that facilitates

18

doing an ESA, off credit and off balance sheet

19

to a government entity, why that solves a

20

variety of problems and make these projects more

21

attractive.

22

a lot of organic inbound interest.

23
24

The honest answer is we're getting

MR. BEITLER:

Also from other major

cities in the U.S.

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company
www.veritext.com

312-346-0911

 Page 68
1

MR. HOFFMAN:

It suggests that you're

2

not aware of other municipalities or states that

3

are actually doing this with ESAs.

4

MS. TRAMM:

Other than Maryland, and I

5

could -- also our lawyer, Mike Dowd, he's been

6

asked to do any other transactions elsewhere,

7

other than Maryland I'm not too aware of anyone

8

else that has been doing them.

9

MR. BEITLER:

The Federal Government.

10

The Federal government is the leader in the use

11

of ESAs, although the version that the Federal

12

Government uses is obviously a little bit

13

different than this because they're not worried

14

about certain benefits than say what we would be

15

concerned about.

16

MS. TRAMM:

So that Nick just pointed

17

out in D.C. Philips Lighting has a contract for

18

about 25 parking facilities to do the lighting

19

sort of like the street lighting proposal here,

20

to do the lighting through an ESA model, so they

21

are just paying per unit of energy saved, so

22

that's another great example of where the ESA is

23

being used.

24

The street lighting industry letting

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company
www.veritext.com

312-346-0911

 Page 69
1

this stream more broadly is pivoting towards

2

ESAs.

3

pivoting quite quickly.

4

companies that have sprung up and lighted new

5

ESAs, et cetera to provide this exact form of

6

financing.

I would say that the commercial sector is

7

MR. HOFFMAN:

8

CHAIRMAN BELL:

9

MR. BEITLER:

There's a number of

Thank you.
Okay.
So we're going to turn to

10

combined heat and power.

Claire will continue

11

discussing this.

12

that will be in the open session as well as in

13

the executive session.

14

continue it later.

This will be a presentation

15

CHAIRMAN BELL:

16

MS. TRAMM:

She will interrupt and

Okay.

So combined heat and power

17

is essentially where we're using a single fuel

18

source like natural gas to both create thermal

19

heat as well as electricity for a building.

20

There are a number of facilities

21

within our huge building portfolio between the

22

city departments and sister agencies which would

23

be great candidates for both large, medium and

24

small sized CHP systems.

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company
www.veritext.com

312-346-0911

 Page 70
1

What's driving this project,

2

however, is there's an application due

3

November 21st that came out fairly recently from

4

the Department of Commerce and Economic

5

Opportunity, DCEO's office, for up to $2 million

6

in grants per individual project, so this would

7

be up to potentially 10 or $12 million for the

8

City to pair with private capital to develop

9

these types of systems in our buildings.

10

Of course this would help us meet

11

our sustainability goals, reduce costs and

12

energy consumption, reduce our carbon output and

13

create jobs, and we believe that the CIT's very

14

well positioned to work across this portfolio of

15

buildings to identify the best facilities for

16

CHP installations and then to develop with one

17

or several private sector companies and

18

engineering feasibility analysis that needs to

19

go into that application that has a strict

20

deadline of November 21st.

21

CHAIRMAN BELL:

So the CIT's role would

22

be to go out and negotiate with these providers

23

for these systems, have them finance them and

24

then we pay for the cost of that financing

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company
www.veritext.com

312-346-0911

 Page 71
1

through the increased energy and operational

2

efficiency?

3

MS. TRAMM:

We're actually proposing

4

that we use an ESA structure for this as well,

5

although there will be an -- in addition to the

6

tax exempt debt, there is a tax credit for this

7

so we would monetize that as well.

8

10 percent tax credit so we would have -- we

9

would be able to raise some money from that as

10

well.

11
12

It's about

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Who would own the

systems in that scenario?

13

MS. TRAMM:

In this scenario, it would

14

be the Trust.

15

the ESA where the Trust is the owner and we are

16

raising tax exempt debt through third party

17

financing as well as getting a guarantee for the

18

forecast and production of this system's energy.

19
20

CHAIRMAN BELL:

MS. TRAMM:

Yes.

So it would be

similar to --

23
24

But the city and its

agency would run it?

21
22

It would be the same format as

CHAIRMAN BELL:

It would be in their

buildings.

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company
www.veritext.com

312-346-0911

 Page 72
1

MS. TRAMM:

Very similar in format.

2

They would be operating and maintaining them

3

themselves or if they didn't feel capable of

4

doing so, we can price that right into the

5

contract.

6
7

CHAIRMAN BELL:

They can hire a

contractor to do this for them.

8

MS. TRAMM:

9

MR. HOFFMAN:

Exactly.
Claire, as envisioned,

10

can you highlight what are the significant

11

differences with the ESA structure that was used

12

for Retrofit 1?

13

MR. BEITLER:

It might be good to wait

14

until we get into the executive session because

15

we have a chart.

16

MR. HOFFMAN:

17

MS. TRAMM:

That's fine.
Yeah, we'll discuss the

18

particulars of the contractor selection and the

19

type of contract we're thinking about in the

20

executive session.

21

MR. HOFFMAN:

Maybe in open session you

22

can just explain a little bit more what -- when

23

you're talking about issuing tax exempt debt,

24

whether that fits within the format and

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company
www.veritext.com

312-346-0911

 Page 73
1

procedure that was used for the ESAs in the

2

Retrofit 1 or whether you're envisioning

3

something different.

4

If to get into details it needs to

5

wait for executive session, that's fine.

6

asking because it's on the slide.

7

MS. TRAMM:

Yes.

I'm

So the ESA structure,

8

we actually issued tax exempt debt so the

9

Trust -- the delays in the project were related

10

to making sure we could issue tax exempt debt,

11

that we had the IRS approval, et cetera, et

12

cetera.

13

So, yes, we'll plan on doing that

14

because it makes us competitive against any

15

potential private financier who says we'll own

16

and operate the systems.

17

rather they not because we can raise less

18

expensive debt than they can with our ESA

19

structure.

20

We would actually

In addition, I would mention that

21

because of the 10 percent investment tax

22

credits, solar benefits from a 30 percent

23

investment tax credit, but CHP has a 10 percent.

24

Because of that, it will probably merit our

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company
www.veritext.com

312-346-0911

 Page 74
1

seeking a for profit partner that would buy the

2

tax -- the credits.

3

we will also do that in addition to tax exempt

4

debt.

5

It's called tax equity.

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Now we have some

6

information on where these systems are

7

installed.

8

this installed in any quantities in any other

9

applications in any other city?

10

Are there any other systems like

MS. TRAMM:

Lots of municipalities have

11

these, lots of hospitals.

12

have these.

13

at the largest buildings in a portfolio for

14

these and that's where we will as well.

15
16

So

Lots of universities

You know, you're typically looking

MR. BEITLER:

Mechanically there's

nothing new going on here.

17

MS. TRAMM:

No.

18

CHAIRMAN BELL:

What I'm really

19

wondering is do we have some history on that

20

they are getting a savings in the operational --

21

MR. BEITLER:

Extensive.

22

MS. TRAMM:

23

CHAIRMAN BELL:

24

MS. TRAMM:

Oh, yeah.
Good.

Okay.

So timeline on this, you

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company
www.veritext.com

312-346-0911

 Page 75
1

can see it's very quick moving right now.

2

hoping to get your approval to move forward with

3

this project at this meeting and then proceed to

4

site identification within our large building

5

portfolio and then doing the engineering

6

feasibility analysis in October and November so

7

that we can hit that deadline for the DCEO grant

8

at the end of November.

9

We're

We expect a response sometime in

10

February of 2015 from the DCEO about how many,

11

if any, of our projects are approved for the up

12

to $2 million grant, and then to do project

13

development and fundraising for it at that

14

point.

15

CHAIRMAN BELL:

16

MR. BEITLER:

Okay.
Thank you.

We're going

17

to move onto compressed natural gas which will

18

also be presented in the opening and executive

19

sessions.

20

MR. EPSTEIN:

So very briefly, the

21

Trust has received an unsolicited proposal from

22

a major compressed natural gas fueling provider.

23

This firm also designs, constructs, operates and

24

maintains filling stations, and the proposal is

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company
www.veritext.com

312-346-0911

 Page 76
1

to fully finance a network of public access CNG

2

stations, and we'll discuss it in more detail in

3

the executive session.

4

In accordance with the process

5

defined in our contracting manual, we are

6

comparing bids or materials for the open bid

7

process where we will invite competitors to

8

submit their proposals as well as proposals from

9

auto manufacturers and technology providers to

10

see what value they can add to the process.

11

In order to assist us in the open

12

bid process, we are engaging consultants with

13

more technical expertise than we have on either

14

a pro bono basis or pursuing federal funding

15

that we would be able to then leverage to hire

16

some of these consultants.

17

We are also in initial discussions

18

with The Clean Cities Coalition, the Illinois

19

and Chicago Chambers of Commerce, the Gas

20

Technology Institute, the National Renewable

21

Energy Laboratory and Argonne National

22

Laboratory to cohost a public forum to educate

23

private sector fleets about this project to

24

educate them on the benefits of compressed

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company
www.veritext.com

312-346-0911

 Page 77
1

natural gas, get their comments and feedback and

2

solicit their interest in participating in the

3

program because the economics only work if you

4

get a number of private sector fleets fueling at

5

these stations along with the City of Chicago

6

fleet.

7
8

CHAIRMAN BELL:

do that in exchange for what?

9
10

So they're willing to

MR. EPSTEIN:

Who is willing to do

that?

11

CHAIRMAN BELL:

You got an unsolicited

12

proposal to design, construct and operate and

13

maintain their own fueling stations in exchange

14

for what?

15

MR. BEITLER:

We basically have a

16

chicken and the egg problem here.

17

essentially through the Trust's intervention and

18

having this project, we have the chicken and the

19

egg problem.

20

So

So the fueling providers are

21

interested in participating simply because we

22

eliminate the chicken and the egg issue.

23

able to bring the City of Chicago fleet and

24

private sector fleet together with the providers

We're

of the gas and give them a sense that it's not

2

build it and they will come, that they will have

3

commitment for customers in the event that they

4

provide this.

5

CHAIRMAN BELL:

The impetus of the

6

proposal, do they have a minimal commitment that

7

they are seeking from us?

8

MR. BEITLER:

9

commitment on our part.

10

CHAIRMAN BELL:

11

No, there's no financial

Not financial, but in

terms of volume and activity for their stations.

12

MR. BEITLER:

No.

13

MR. EPSTEIN:

Yes, there is.

14

MR. BEITLER:

Well, they have a

15

requirement per station.

16

MR. EPSTEIN:

Right.

17

MR. BEITLER:

But they don't

18

necessarily build all their stations at once.

19

CHAIRMAN BELL:

I got that, Steve.

I'm

20

just trying to understand.

21

do this in exchange for what?

22

commit to a certain amount of volume if it's on

23

per station or in total or what?

24

MR. BEITLER:

They're willing to
Do we have to

We don't sign a contract

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company
www.veritext.com

312-346-0911

 Page 79
1

with them committing the Trust or the City or

2

anybody to a certain amount of volume.

3

MR. EPSTEIN:

Right.

4

MR. BEITLER:

What we do is basically

5

line up fleets that are willing to convert, and

6

as the fleets say, we will convert this many

7

vehicles.

8

will build this many stations, but we're not

9

signing something.

10

Then the gas provider says fine, we

CHAIRMAN BELL:

We're not committing.

11

I mean, if it doesn't work, they just don't

12

build the stations.

13

MR. EPSTEIN:

Correct.

14

MR. BEITLER:

No.

15

MS. FERGUSON:

What stops the providers

16

from approaching the fleets themselves?

17

the Trust uniquely positioned to have that?

18

MR. BEITLER:

Why is

I can't completely answer

19

that question because it's a good question and

20

it's kind of a little bit of a mystery, but it

21

doesn't -- it has not seemed to work here.

22

In the State of Virginia, the state

23

intervened there.

In southern California, the

24

state intervened there.

And in Texas, which is

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company
www.veritext.com

312-346-0911

 Page 80
1

the third large market where this is occurring,

2

the state intervened there.

3

So for whatever reason, it doesn't

4

seem that this gets off the ground without

5

public entities intervening to cause these

6

partners to get together to do this, and as to

7

the causal reason as to why they can't get

8

together, we really don't have a good answer.

9

CHAIRMAN BELL:

10

MR. HOFFMAN:

Okay.
My one comment, which I

11

made before, I may make each time we bring this

12

up is we should absolutely pursue this, and I

13

also think while we're pursuing it, we should

14

think about whether it can be expanded beyond

15

just compressed natural gas, not necessarily for

16

the city fleet, but I think the discussion from

17

the beginning was that these stations would be

18

available to other private fleets and others,

19

and since we can't see around the corner about

20

five or ten years from now about what energy

21

source will be considered the most efficient in

22

terms of use, we want to guard against the idea

23

that several years down the road compressed

24

natural gas is a less attractive fuel source.

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company

312-346-0911

 Page 81
1

So it may be that the bids will be

2

focused on just providing CNG for city vehicles,

3

and that's the core of this, but we might want

4

to take advantage of the project to make it even

5

broader.

6

MR. BEITLER:

Some other providers may

7

be interested in doing, you know, for electric

8

cars, but we're leaving that up to them right

9

now.

The focus is largely CNG, but we take your

10

point and we have discussed it, and there may be

11

some interest in providing fueling for electric

12

vehicles.

13
14

MR. HOFFMAN:

That would be

available --

15

MR. EPSTEIN:

We leave that open ended

16

enough to solicit those additional types of

17

ideas in the open bid process.

18

MR. BEITLER:

19

discussing the CTA 4G project.

20

MR. EPSTEIN:

We will now move to

At the end of last year,

21

the CTA reached out to the Trust to help them

22

identify cost effective financing strategies for

23

the 4G wireless upgrades that they are currently

24

pursuing in the subway system.

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company
www.veritext.com

312-346-0911

 Page 82
1

Prior to our involvement, the CTA

2

was either planning or eliminating or reducing

3

funding for other projects and moving those

4

funds to pay for the 4G upgrades or issuing debt

5

to pay for the project, and they asked us to

6

find a better way.

7

After months of research and

8

diligence work, we did devise a better way to do

9

it, and we met with all of the major wireless

10

providers, and we said we think that this is a

11

project that has value for you and your

12

customers and that you should fund it.

13

So we got the carriers together as a

14

unified carrier team that operates under what's

15

known as the National Teaming Agreement which is

16

a federally approved arrangement that allows the

17

wireless carriers to collaborate and fund on

18

projects without giving rise to any antitrust

19

concerns.

20

We have received the term sheet from

21

the carrier team to fund the majority of the

22

project, and we are now in negotiations in

23

assisting the CTA in responding to the term

24

sheet, and we hope to come to the terms with the

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company
www.veritext.com

312-346-0911

 Page 83
1

carriers within a month of this.

2

MR. BEITLER:

So the carriers wish to

3

engage the Trust going forward which we have

4

discussed previously; however, we don't have a

5

resolution that would enable Trust staff to

6

enter into an agreement for that purpose, so we

7

are asking the Board today to approve this

8

resolution to allow Trust staff to enter into

9

that agreement.

10

MR. HOFFMAN:

Steve, just so I can

11

understand, I think you made this clear, but

12

this is not a situation where the Trust is

13

providing or arranging financing, it's, as you

14

said, a services contract to provide -- sort of

15

a consulting contract to provide consulting

16

service.

17

MR. BEITLER:

For what the staff is

18

asking for approval, yes, that's absolutely

19

correct.

20
21

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Any other questions?

Do I have a motion?

22

MR. HOFFMAN:

23

MS. FERGUSON:

24

CHAIRMAN BELL:

I so move.
Second.
All in favor.

comments.

Stand up and say who you are.

MR. MELLIS:

10
11

Thank you.

MR. BEITLER:

There was no sign in.
Just state your name,

please.

12

MR. MELLIS:

Thank you, Mr. Chairman,

13

Members of the Board, my name is Allan Mellis,

14

community leader for 40 years, and the first

15

member of the public to suggest a possible

16

project to be considered by your committee.

17

Last month I saw Alderman Pope in

18

City Hall and he mentioned he hadn't seen me at

19

a Chicago Infrastructure Trust meeting in a long

20

time, so here I am, John.

21

and fascinated by the discussions, so I'm happy

22

I came.

23
24

I was very impressed

On April 3rd, 2013, I presented to
the Infrastructure Trust a proposed monorail

McGuire's Reporting Service – A Veritext Company
www.veritext.com

312-346-0911

 Page 85
1

that would connect the Roosevelt CTA

2

Superstation to the Museum Campus in Northerly

3

Island and now the Lucas Narrative Art Museum.

4

This week I attended Mayor Emanuel's

5

museum campus transportation plan open house at

6

MPC, right here.

7

was to get museum campus transportation

8

suggestions from the public.

The purpose of the open house

9

I presented my monorail proposal and

10

provided suggested criteria for analyzing museum

11

campus transportation alternatives.

12

information is attached to your handout.

13

That

Finally, no matter what

14

transportation alternative will be recommended

15

for the museum campus by Mayor Emanuel's

16

committee, the Infrastructure Trust should be

17

involved in the financial aspects of its

18

implementation.

Thank you very much.

19

CHAIRMAN BELL:

20

MR. MELLIS:

21

MR. BEITLER:

22

That was brief, right?
Can we get a copy to make

sure staff has a copy?

23
24

Thank you.

CHAIRMAN BELL:
your comments.

Thank you, Allen, for

We'll obviously evaluate it.

We

 Page 86
1

appreciate you spending time and effort and

2

providing this to us.

3

Any other public comment?

4

(No response.)

5

Now I think we have to actually vote

6

to go into Executive Session, and we need our

7

legal representative to state the provision

8

within the Open Meetings Act that allows us to

9

do so.

10

MR. BUTLER:

Absolutely.

11

MR. BEITLER:

12

Ellis has gotten really tough.

So section --

You can see Kirkland &

13

CHAIRMAN BELL:

14

MR. BUTLER:

They are battle tested.

Section 2(c)(7) of the

15

Illinois Open Meetings Act states that an open

16

meeting of a public body can be closed to

17

consider the sale or purchase of securities,

18

investments or investment contracts, and under

19

that provision we can now go into Executive

20

Session.

21

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Okay.

22

MS. FERGUSON:

MR. RAMIREZ:

I'm sorry, I didn't hear

further discussion?

15

So moved.
Seconded.
Any discussion?

Any

I think it's pretty clear.

MR. HOFFMAN:

For the record, we

16

discussed this in closed session, and I don't

17

believe any further discussion is necessary.

18

CHAIRMAN BELL:

19

All in favor?

(A chorus of ayes.)

20

That's passed.

21

MR. BEITLER:

22

24

Hoffman and by Alderman Thomas and then you will

MR. RAMIREZ:

The motion is made.

12

ALDERMAN POPE:

Second.

13

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Any discussion?

14

MR. HOFFMAN:

So we had discussion on

15

this in closed session, and in light of that

16

discussion, I don't think there's any need for

17

additional discussion.

18

CHAIRMAN BELL:

19

All in favor?

(A chorus of ayes.)

20

Okay.

21

Passed.
You got the two resolutions.

22

Okay.

Now, do we need a motion to adjourn the

23

public session?

24

MR. HOFFMAN:

I would happy to make
