STATE’S ATTORNEY, Anita Alvarez, submitting communication advising the County of
the Agreed Order Appointing a Transitional Administrator regarding Jimmy Doe v. County
of Cook, USDC No. 99-C-3945. This class action litigation was originally brought in 1999
and has subsequently involved the entry of a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between
the parties that was approved by the District Court in December 2002 and the entry of an
Agreed Supplemental Order approved by the Court on May 18, 2006. This petition was
resolved by the entry of an Agreed Order Appointing a Transitional Administrator (TA) by
the District Court on August 14, 2007. The Board of Commissioners agreed to the entry of
the subject order during its meeting of July 31, 2007.
On June 18, 2008, the District Court entered an order amending this portion of the TA
Order permitting the Transitional Administrator to maintain the OTA funds in a separate
account to pay reasonable costs and expenses of the staff of the OTA. The OTA account
was first funded at $800,000.00 on July 22, 2008 and the District Court entered an order for
additional funds of $500,000.00 respectively on December 18, 2008, April 14, 2009, June
30, 2009, November 17, 2009, April 7, 2010, August 3, 2010, November 23, 2010, March
29, 2011, June 30, 2011, November 3, 2011, February 28, 2012 and July 26, 2012.
The Transitional Administrator has now presented invoice payment records evidencing
payments and a balance in the account as of October 9, 2012 in the amount of $129,812.31
which has been reviewed and accepted by the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office. The
TA has requested the District Court to enter an order providing for an additional
disbursement of $500,000.00 into the OTA account which was approved by the Court on
October 25, 2012.
Upon approval, the Cook County Comptroller will transfer $500,000.00 from the SelfInsurance Fund to an account managed by the Transitional Administrator in accordance
with the terms of the aforementioned court order. From July 22, 2008 to date, inclusive of
this court order, $7,300,000.00 has been transferred from the Self-Insurance fund to the
Office of the Transitional Administrator.

URGING GOVERNOR PAT QUINN AND THE ILLINOIS GENERAL ASSEMBLY
TO LOOK AT MEDICAID SAVINGS ALTERNATIVES
WHEREAS, the health care needs of the residents of Cook County are provided for by a
safety network of hospitals comprised of Medicaid safety net hospitals, children’s hospitals,
public hospitals, academic medical centers and community hospitals; and
WHEREAS, this hospital safety network also provides financial support and services to a
variety of community health care clinics and Federally Qualified Health Centers to further
meet the health care needs of the county’s residents; and
WHEREAS, in a time of economic instability, hospitals support one of Illinois’ economic
engines, employing directly and indirectly over 407,000 people and driving more than $78
billion in economic stimulus in the State of Illinois; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners recognizes that hospitals are strong
anchors of their communities, directly and indirectly supporting nearly 277,000 jobs in the
Chicago metropolitan area; and
WHEREAS, Medicaid spending in Illinois is financially not sustainable and must change;
and
WHEREAS, Governor Pat Quinn has proposed to balance the State of Illinois budget by
cutting Medicaid by $2.7 billion threatening this critical program, which is a lifeline to
hospitals and many residents of Cook County; and
WHEREAS, further cuts to hospital reimbursement could reduce access to care to some of
Cook County’s most vulnerable patient populations, including the elderly, disabled,
children and destitute; and,
WHEREAS, cutting Medicaid reimbursement will not only jeopardize the provision of
services, but also the jobs of those who provide them; and
WHEREAS, hospitals have identified nearly $1.4 billion in savings available to the State
from hospital Medicaid programs and policies; and
WHEREAS, the hospital community understands the budget crisis facing the State and has
adopted these cost-saving alternatives as a shared position; and
WHEREAS, Governor Quinn and the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family
Services (HFS), in collaboration with the Cook County Board of Commissioners and the
Cook County Health and Hospitals System (CCHHS) has requested an 1115 waiver from
the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), to cover the current uninsured
population that will become eligible for Medicaid in 2014; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners is concerned for the physical and
economic health and well-being of the citizens of Cook County and the State of Illinois.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that state legislators and hospitals work
together to find solutions that will not impact patient care or jeopardize access to health care

47

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 14, 2012
for the State’s most underserved communities while maintaining the financial health of
hospitals; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that it is incumbent on the State of Illinois to enact
operational and eligibility reforms before reducing hospital and physician rates that will
result in immediate job cuts and a reduction in access to care for society’s neediest
members; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Illinois General Assembly take action to pass the
state plan amendment to the existing Hospital Assessment program and the 1115 waiver
request that will bring in additional revenue through Federal match; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners call upon
Governor Quinn to proceed expeditiously to achieve any savings identified by Illinois
hospitals in their list of “potential Medicaid Savings Alternatives” and to identify and
implement any other systematic savings available to the Medicaid program; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a suitable copy of this Resolution is spread upon the
official proceedings of this Honorable Body and that an official copy of the same be

recommendation is as follows:
320600

SUPPORTING THE REPORTING OF LOST OR STOLEN FIREARMS (PROPOSED
RESOLUTION). Submitting a Proposed Resolution sponsored by Larry Suffredin, John P.
Daley and Edwin Reyes, County Commissioners.
SUPPORTING THE REPORTING OF LOST OR STOLEN FIREARMS
WHEREAS, gun violence is a public health epidemic that touches the lives of ALL
Americans, and every year thousands of families, friends, schools and communities are
devastated by gun violence; and
WHEREAS, according to the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, 1,064
people died from gun injuries in Illinois in 2010, the most recent year for which statistics
are available; and

87

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 14, 2012
WHEREAS, federal law 18 U.S.C. § 923 (g)(6) requires licensed firearms dealers, but not
firearms owners, to report the loss or theft of firearms to law enforcement within 48 hours;
and
WHEREAS, laws requiring the reporting of lost or stolen firearms are beneficial to law
enforcement because: (1) when a crime gun is traced by law enforcement to the last
purchaser of record, that person may falsely claim that the gun was lost or stolen to hide his
or her involvement in the crime or in gun trafficking; and (2) reporting laws provide a tool
for law enforcement to detect this behavior and charge criminals who engage in it; and
WHEREAS, a December 2008 report by Mayors Against Illegal Guns entitled “The
Movement of Illegal Guns in America: The Link between Gun Laws and Interstate Gun
Trafficking” concluded that lost or stolen firearm reporting laws “can help law enforcement
more easily identify and prosecute gun traffickers;” and
WHEREAS, a September 2010 report by Mayors Against Illegal Guns entitled “Trace the
Gus: The Link Between Gun Laws and Interstate Gun Trafficking,” presented data showing
that states that do not require gun owners to report lost or stolen guns to police are the
source of guns used in crimes that are recovered in other states at a rate more than two and a
half times greater that states that have lost or stolen reporting laws; and
WHEREAS, reporting laws help disarm persons prohibited from possessing firearms.
When a person who legally owned a gun falls into a prohibited category, it is crucial for law
enforcement to be able to remove the firearm from his or her possession. For example, a gun
owner who is convicted of a felony or who becomes the subject of a domestic violence
restraining order is not permitted under federal law to continue to possess firearms.
However, when ordered to surrender a firearm by law enforcement or a judge, the owner
may falsely claim it has been lost or stolen; and
WHEREAS, reporting laws protect gun owners from unwarranted criminal accusations
when their guns are recovered at a crime scene, and make it easier for law enforcement to
locate a lost or stolen firearm and return it to its lawful owner. A 2007 report, the
International Association of Chiefs of Police concluded that, “law enforcement‘s early
awareness of every lost and stolen gun will enhance their ability to recover those guns and
reduce gun violence” and recommended that state and local governments mandate reporting
of lost or stolen firearms; and
WHEREAS, according to a 2000 report from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms
entitled “Following the Gun: Enforcing Federal Laws Against Firearms Traffickers,” at
least 500,000 firearms are stolen each year from residences across the United States; and
WHEREAS, the extreme danger firearms pose to public safety requires a heightened level
of accountability on the part of individuals who choose to own firearms; and
WHEREAS, laws requiring the reporting of lost or stolen firearms have been adopted in
jurisdictions throughout the country. Firearm owners are currently required to report lost or
stolen firearms in seven states and the District of Columbia, and in a number of local
jurisdictions in California and Pennsylvania, as well as in certain other major cities,
including Chicago, Illinois; Hartford, Connecticut; and New York, New York; and
WHEREAS, the American public overwhelmingly supports laws requiring the reporting of

88

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 14, 2012
lost or stolen firearms. A 2011 survey by American Viewpoint/Momentum Analysis of
public attitudes toward gun violence prevention measures found almost unanimous support
for these laws: 94% of all people surveyed, including 94% of gun owners polled, favored
reporting laws; and
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook
County urge the Illinois General Assembly to require firearm owners to report to law
enforcement if a firearm they own or possess is lost or stolen; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County
believes that requiring the reporting of lost or stolen guns will help improve public safety by
deterring gun trafficking, improving gun crime investigations, protecting gun owners from
unwarranted accusations, and enabling law enforcement to disarm ineligible gun owners and
return lost or stolen firearms to their owners.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County does
hereby urge the Illinois General Assembly to improve state laws that make gun owners
accountable for their firearms and require them to act responsibly; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County urges
the Illinois General Assembly to enact a law making it unlawful for a person who resides in
Illinois to fail to report to law enforcement the theft or loss of a firearm he or she owns or
possesses within forty-eight (48) hours of the time he or she knew or reasonably should
have known that the firearm had been stolen or lost.
*Referred to the Legislation and Intergovernmental Relations Committee on 11/01/12.
Commissioner Daley, seconded by Commissioner Murphy, moved to accept the Substitute to
Communication No. 320600. The motion carried.

Edward Acevedo, Eddie Winters, Maria Antonia Berrios and Luis Arroyo to introduce House Bill 1855,
which requires the reporting of lost or stolen firearms to law enforcement; and

SUPPORTING THE REPORTING OF LOST OR STOLEN FIREARMS
WHEREAS, gun violence is a public health epidemic that touches the lives of ALL Americans, and
every year thousands of families, friends, schools and communities are devastated by gun violence; and

91

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 14, 2012
WHEREAS, according to the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control 1,064 people died from
gun injuries in Illinois in 2010 the most recent year for which statistics are available; and
WHEREAS, federal law 18 U.S.C. § 923 (g)(6) requires licensed firearms dealers, but not firearms
owners, to report the loss or theft of firearms to law enforcement within 48 hours; and
WHEREAS, laws requiring the reporting of lost or stolen firearms are beneficial to law enforcement
because: (1) when a crime gun is traced by law enforcement to the last purchaser of record, that person
may falsely claim that the gun was lost or stolen to hide his or her involvement in the crime or in gun
trafficking; and (2) reporting laws provide a tool for law enforcement to detect this behavior and charge
criminals who engage in it; and
WHEREAS, Cook County State’s Attorney Anita Alvarez has long supported legislation to require the
reporting of lost or stolen firearms to law enforcement; and
WHEREAS, Cook County State’s Attorney Anita Alvarez encouraged Illinois State Representatives
Edward Acevedo, Eddie Winters, Maria Antonia Berrios and Luis Arroyo to introduce House Bill 1855,
which requires the reporting of lost or stolen firearms to law enforcement; and
WHEREAS, a December 2008 report by Mayors Against Illegal Guns entitled “The Movement of Illegal
Guns in America: The Link between Gun Laws and Interstate Gun Trafficking” concluded that lost or
stolen firearm reporting laws “can help law enforcement more easily identify and prosecute gun
traffickers”; and
WHEREAS, a September 2010 report by Mayors Against Illegal Guns entitled “Trace the Gus: The
Link Between Gun Laws and Interstate Gun Trafficking”, presented data showing that states that do not
require gun owners to report lost or stolen guns to police are the source of guns used in crimes that are
recovered in other states at a rate more than two and a half times greater that states that have lost or stolen
reporting laws; and
WHEREAS, reporting laws help disarm persons prohibited from possessing firearms. When a person
who legally owned a gun falls into a prohibited category, it is crucial for law enforcement to be able to
remove the firearm from his or her possession. For example, a gun owner who is convicted of a felony or
who becomes the subject of a domestic violence restraining order is not permitted under federal law to
continue to possess firearms. However, when ordered to surrender a firearm by law enforcement or a
judge, the owner may falsely claim it has been lost or stolen; and
WHEREAS, reporting laws protect gun owners from unwarranted criminal accusations when their guns
are recovered at a crime scene, and make it easier for law enforcement to locate a lost or stolen firearm
and return it to its lawful owner. A 2007 report, the International Association of Chiefs of Police
concluded that, “law enforcement‘s early awareness of every lost and stolen gun will enhance their ability
to recover those guns and reduce gun violence” and recommended that state and local governments
mandate reporting of lost or stolen firearms; and
WHEREAS, according to a 2000 report from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms entitled
“Following the Gun: Enforcing Federal Laws Against Firearms Traffickers”; at least 500,000 firearms
are stolen each year from residences across the United States; and
WHEREAS, the extreme danger firearms pose to public safety requires a heightened level of
accountability on the part of individuals who choose to own firearms; and

92

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 14, 2012
WHEREAS, laws requiring the reporting of lost or stolen firearms have been adopted in jurisdictions
throughout the country. Firearm owners are currently required to report lost or stolen firearms in seven
states and the District of Columbia, and in a number of local jurisdictions in California and Pennsylvania,
as well as in certain other major cities, including Chicago, Illinois; Hartford, Connecticut; and New York,
New York; and
WHEREAS, the American public overwhelmingly supports laws requiring the reporting of lost or stolen
firearms. A 2011 survey by American Viewpoint/Momentum Analysis of public attitudes toward gun
violence prevention measures found almost unanimous support for these laws: 94% of all people
surveyed, including 94% of gun owners polled favored reporting laws.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County urge the
Illinois General Assembly to require firearm owners to report to law enforcement if a firearm they own or
possess is lost or stolen; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County believes that
requiring the reporting of lost or stolen guns will help improve public safety by deterring gun trafficking,
improving gun crime investigations, protecting gun owners from unwarranted accusations, and enabling
law enforcement to disarm ineligible gun owners and return lost or stolen firearms to their owners; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County does hereby urge the
Illinois General Assembly to improve state laws that make gun owners accountable for their firearms and
require them to act responsibly by passing House Bill 1855 or a similar bill; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County urges the Illinois
General Assembly to enact a law making it unlawful for a person who resides in Illinois to fail to report to
law enforcement the theft or loss of a firearm he or she owns or possesses within forty-eight (48) seventytwo (72) hours of the time he or she knew or reasonably should have known that the firearm had been
stolen or lost.
Approved and adopted this 14th day of November 2012.

SECRETARY TO THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS
CONTRACT
Transmitting a Communication, dated October 12, 2012 from
MATTHEW B. DeLEON, Secretary to the Board of Commissioners
and
MARIA DE LOURDES COSS, Chief Procurement Officer
requesting authorization for the Chief Procurement Officer to enter into and execute a contract with
Granicus, Inc., San Francisco, California, for a Legislative Electronic Document Management System.

95

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 14, 2012
Reason:

The Legislative Electronic Document Management System (System) is an automated agenda
workflow solution that enables paperless creation, production and distribution of agendas,
back-up documents, amendments and reports for a number of Cook County legislative bodies.
The System provides effective tracking of progress through the legislative process, voting and
an integrated searchable database of proposed and approved legislation. When indexed with
our media archive, the system attaches any video of the deliberations on a given item to
provide widest possible context of legislative history on an item.
The System may enable County agencies to experience a decrease in the amount of time spent
preparing paper copies of items and supporting documentation, delivering information to
Commissioners and the President and tracking results and progress of their items.
Additionally, the System will also provide an opportunity for other county agencies with
public agendas to automate their agenda processes.
There is no connectivity between the existing Automated Board Agenda system (ABA) built
in 2008 and the existing legislative document system (“Jackets”) built in 1995. Board items
for referral to committee and entered into the ABA must be manually keyed into the Jackets
system to assign committee numbers and create committee agendas and reports. New items
and Consent Calendar items must also be manually entered into Jackets. Manual entry
between systems increases significantly the chance for error in the information, jeopardizing
the accuracy of the legislative record. As the Jackets system has aged, the Clerk’s office
experiences ongoing maintenance issues for which it is difficult to find technical support.
Cook County seeks to piggyback on an existing contract between this vendor and the Office
of the City Clerk of Chicago. Chicago is one of over 1000 municipal, county and state
governments which have contracted with Granicus to provide similar functions. Among those
are: New York City; Los Angeles City Council; King County, Washington; City of New
Orleans; the Tennessee General Assembly; City of Milwaukee; Lake County, Illinois; Miami
Dade County, Florida; City and County of San Francisco, California, among others.
It is expected that $69,900.00 will be spent on configuration, development, implementation
and training. Annual cost of the system is $66,000.00.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $267,900.00 [FY 2012: $66,000.00 - (490-441 Account); and $69,900.00 (717/018-579 Account); FY 2013: $66,000.00 - (490-441 Account); and FY 2014: $66,000.00 - (490-441
Account)]. Contract period: October 2, 2012 through September 6, 2013 with the option of two (2) oneyear extensions.
Approval of this item would commit Fiscal Years 2013 and 2014 funds.
The Chief Procurement Officer concurs.
Vendor has met the Minority and Women Business Enterprise Ordinance.
The Chief Information Officer has reviewed this item and concurs with this recommendation.
_________________________
Commissioner Daley, seconded by Commissioner Sims, moved that the Chief Procurement Officer be
authorized to enter into the requested contract. The motion carried unanimously.

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
October 17, 2012 is when it became apparent that Institutional Supplies and Household, Laundry,
Cleaning and Personal Care Supplies needed an infusion of funds because the balances were
insufficient to meet our needs for the remainder of the fiscal year. The account balances on that
date were $249,281.00 in Institutional Supplies and $16,576.00 in Household, Laundry, Cleaning
and Personal Care Supplies.

2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
The accounts for the source of transferred funds were identified because of the amount of
unencumbered funds in these accounts.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from.
None

4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 14, 2012
These accounts where chosen because of the unobligated surplus in Contractual Maintenance
Services, Op., Maint. and Repair of Institutional Equipment, Maintenance and Repair of Plant

requesting authorization to accept a grant award in the amount of $213,300.00 from the United States
