employers as well as donated building supplies and materials, and general contributions to Habitat for
Humanity Chicago South Suburbs will be contributed to the project. The HOME award will be structured

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 19, 2010
SHERIFF'S CUSTODIAL SERVICES DEPARTMENT
PROPOSED CONTRACT ADDENDUM
Transmitting a Communication, dated September 29, 2010 from
THOMAS J. DART, Sheriff of Cook County
by
SALVADOR GODINEZ, Executive Director, Department of Corrections
RONALD F. ROSE, Chief County Custodian
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to extend from October 20, 2010 through December 31,
2010, Contract No. 07-53-288 with Allied Waste Services of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, for scavenger
services for the Department of Corrections and the Custodial Services Department.
Reason:

This extension will allow sufficient time for the award and transition to a new contract
vendor. The expiration date of the current contract is October 19, 2010. Approximately
$638,450.00 remains on this contract.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: None. Contract extension: October 20, 2010 through December 31, 2010.
Vendor has met the Minority and Women Business Enterprise Ordinance.

DEPARTMENT OF FACILITIES MANAGEMENT
APPROVAL OF PAYMENT
Transmitting a Communication, dated September 22, 2010 from
JAMES D'AMICO, Director, Department of Facilities Management
requesting approval of payment in the amount of $298,923.00 to BMS CAT, Fort Worth, Texas, for
disaster recovery, remediation and restoration services required due to the flooding at the Criminal Courts
Complex, South Campus Buildings on July 24, 2010.
Reason:

The Purchasing Agent in a letter dated August 27, 2010, advised the Board of Commissioners
of the emergency purchase of these services made necessary by the uncontrolled flooding
from torrential rain and sewer backup into the buildings. Visible microbial growth appeared
due to the high moisture content remaining from the initial cleanup. This situation would
only worsen if not addressed immediately. The vendor chosen was still on site for work at the
Criminal Courts Administration Building and is a Government Services Association Certified
Contractor under Contract GS-07F-0087T and is a nationwide company specializing in
disaster recovery. These services were procured in accordance with Section 34-156,
Emergency Purchases, as authorized under the Cook County Procurement Code.

Reason:

account was originally budgeted in anticipation of the FY 2010 transfer of these responsibilities to
the Department of Facilities Management which is no longer expected to occur this fiscal year.
For all other accounts we have re-prioritized expenditures based on the needs of the department.

4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
None.

HIGHWAY DEPARTMENT
PROPOSED AGREEMENT RESOLUTION
Transmitting a Communication from

93

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 19, 2010
RUPERT F. GRAHAM, JR., P.E., Superintendent of Highways
Submitting for your approval ONE (1) AGREEMENT/RESOLUTION:
1. Highway Authority Agreement along with a Supplemental Agreement between the County of Cook
and Barney II Family Foundation
1930 Arlington Heights Road (CH V69) at Rand Road (US 12)
in the Village of Arlington Heights in County Board District #14
Fiscal Impact: None.
The Department of Highways submits for execution three (3) copies of a Highway Authority Agreement
along with a Supplemental Agreement with Barney II Family Foundation for facilities at 1930 Arlington
Heights Road, the intersection of Arlington Heights Road (CH V69) at Rand Road, in the Village of
Arlington Heights. This two-agreement approach became necessary when the Illinois Administrative
Code was amended to provide that all future Tiered Approach to Corrective Action Objectives
Agreements be based upon a State-mandated form. The Supplemental Agreement contains greater
protections for Cook County than the state form and together they are considered as a single
“Agreement”.
The Agreement has been prepared in compliance with Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA)
directives toward a tiered approach in dealing with petroleum contamination to soils. For contaminate
concentrations which are of low levels, Tier 1 residential remediation, the IEPA allows for their
remaining in place subject to certain conditions which are, in part, that pumping of potable water in the
location be prohibited, that excavators in the location be informed of the proscribed status for material
handling and that any excavated material be properly disposed. The IEPA requirements also call for these
Agreements to, by reference, be recorded against the property.
The location listed as subject for Highway Authority Agreements is, in part, located along a County
highway and so being, the County has control of the right-of-way through the Highway Department
Permit Office. The County, by executing the Agreement, will agree to restrict the extraction of potable
water from this location, inform Permittees of the proscribed status of the referenced location and require
that Permittees properly dispose of excavated soil.
The Agreement further indemnifies and holds the County harmless from liabilities and damages arising
from the petroleum contamination; as well as makes provisions for reimbursement of expenses incurred
by the County should the Highway Department be required in the course of normal maintenance to
expose and dispose of contaminated soils.
The Agreement was prepared following a Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office prepared Standard
Agreement and has been examined and approved by this Department and the State's Attorney's Office. It
is respectfully requested that, should your Honorable Body concur in this recommendation, the resolution
be adopted and the Agreement executed and that an executed copy of the Agreement be returned to
Barney II Family Foundation for further processing and forwarding to the Illinois Environmental
Protection Agency.

construction engineering, through a forthcoming reimbursement agreement.
This improvement, as proposed, will consist of milling and resurfacing the existing pavement and shall

OFFICE OF THE PUBLIC ADMINISTRATOR
TRANSFER OF FUNDS

103

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 19, 2010
Transmitting a Communication, dated September 24, 2010 from
NICHOLAS G. GRAPSAS, Public Administrator, Office of the Public Administrator
requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners to transfer funds totaling $18,690.00 from and to the
following accounts listed below.
Reason:

The Office of the Public Administrator is requesting the transfer of the following accounts to
re-allocate funds for the remainder of the fiscal year. Re-allocating the funds to the General
& Contingent Expenses line item will allow the office to update the records inventory and
contract a company to destroy old records in accordance with the local records act.

From Accounts:
390-190
390-441
390-630

Transportation and Other Travel Expenses for Employees
Maintenance and Repair of Data Processing Equipment and Software
Rental of Office Equipment
Total

$10,000.00
4,214.00
4,476.00
$18,690.00

To Account:
390-890

General and Contingent Expenses
Total

1.

$18,690.00
$18,690.00

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
On May 23, 2010 the balance of the account became zero. Re-allocating the funds to the General
and Contingent Expenses line item will allow the office to update the records inventory and
contract a company to destroy old records in accordance with the local records act.

2.

How were the accounts used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
On September 17, 2010, the Office of the Public Administrator reviewed current expenditures and
noted three accounts that would not be used for the specific accounts appropriated prior to the end
of the fiscal year. All accounts are currently balanced and no transfer is needed as a result of
deficient spending.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from.
None.

4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
190 Transportation and Other Travel Expenses for Employees

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 19, 2010
Procedures and protocols involving the Investigators underwent a review and subsequent
modifications were implemented. These changes optimized updated technologies and modernized
computer search engines allowing the office to restructure and update the investigation process.
Consequently, less transportation and travel expense was ultimately realized. Furthermore, the
updating of this process has allowed our office to streamline the investigation department while the
addition of an internal investigator has provided a more efficient and cost effective investigations
operation.
441 Maintenance and Repair of Data Processing Equipment and Software
By advancing funds from the office’s operating account this office received a discounted amount
for the licensing of the necessary equipment and products. It is expected that the cost of licensing
shall increase for fiscal year 2011.
630 Rental of Office Equipment
Previous rented directories have been replaced by purchasing licensing online with funds
appropriated to the operating account.

On September 15, 2010 it was determined that this office needed additional funding for this project.

COOK COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE
TRANSFER OF FUNDS
Transmitting a Communication, dated September 24, 2010 from
ZAHRA ALI, Director, Department of Revenue
requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners to transfer funds totaling $8,000.00 from and to the
accounts listed below, for enhanced revenue compliance efforts.
Reason:

The Department of Revenue has increased compliance efforts for cigarette confiscation and
illegal sales. This has resulted in increased revenue, as the department continues levying
sizable fines. Transportation expenses have also increased; this is due to more field
investigations throughout Cook County. Such field investigations and new departments
utilizing the Department of Administrative Hearings have lead to increased costs associated
with the administrative hearings collection process. These costs include certified mailing and
delivery services. Additionally, the department's printing costs have escalated due to our
aggressive Use Tax collection and Wheel Tax efforts. We are sending out more notices and
correspondences to delinquent taxpayers.

It became apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds in order to meet
current obligation on September 13, 2010. The balance for Delivery Services was $327.00,

109

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 19, 2010
Transportation and Other Travel Services for Employees was $2,035.00 and Printing and
Publishing was $311.00. Thirty days prior the balance for Delivery Services was $638.00,
Transportation and Other Travel Services for Employees was $2,256.00 and Printing and
Publishing was $7,467.00.
2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
The accounts used for the source of transferred funds were identified based upon potential revenue
recovery, priority and need. The accounts used were the only accounts considered.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from 007-355 and 007-630.
No other obligations will be impacted as a result of these transfers.

4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
The accounts that we are transferring from have available balances due to effectively monitoring of
expenses closely throughout the year and conserving costs. This allows us to increase our
compliance efforts and pursue identified revenue opportunities. However, we will continue to
strategically streamline operations, conserve costs and operate off a tighter budget. In no way does
the department have an unobligated surplus.

SOCIAL SERVICE DEPARTMENT
PROPOSED CONTRACT ADDENDUM
Transmitting a Communication, dated September 15, 2010 from
TIMOTHY C. EVANS, Chief Judge, Circuit Court of Cook County
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to increase by $4,950.00, Contract No. 10-41-82 with
Alliance Against Intoxicated Motorists, Schaumburg, Illinois, to conduct an additional six (6) Victim
Impact Panels in the First Municipal District in Chicago, Illinois.
Board approved amount 06-01-10:
Increase requested:
Adjusted amount:
Reason:

$33,825.00

Victim Impact Panels are an important element of the Court's referral program that seeks to
reduce Driving Under the Influence (DUI) recidivism. The panels consist of victims and past
offenders that were involved in alcohol or drug related accidents, who relate their experiences
before groups of DUI offenders. The program has proven to be effective in educating

110

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 19, 2010
offenders about the consequences of their behavior.
This increase is needed in order to provide additional panels in District One located at 2650
South California Avenue, Chicago, Illinois in order to accommodate the Court's referrals.
The expiration date of the current contract is June 30, 2011.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: $4,950.00. (541-260 Account).
Sufficient funds are available in the Social Service/Probation and Court Services Fund.

requesting authorization to accept a grant in the amount of $500,000.00 from the U.S. Department of
Justice, Office for Victims of Crime for the Cook County Enhanced Collaborative Model to Combat
Human Trafficking Task Force. This award will allow the Office to dedicate two (2) Assistant State’s

IOFA.
The remaining costs of the Program Specialist position will be funded through our collaborative partner
agency, the Salvation Army, under a separate grant award that they were awarded.
This grant-funded position would be dedicated to the Task Force and will help facilitate the goals and
activities of the grant, support the Office and the Salvation Army as needed, and work with key staff from
both partner organizations as well as other Task Force member agencies. The twenty-five percent

PROPOSED GRANT AWARD RENEWAL
Transmitting a Communication, dated September 23, 2010 from
MICHELE V. LATZ, Chief of the Administrative Services Bureau, State’s Attorney’s Office
requesting authorization to renew a grant in the amount of $2,050,000.00 from the Office of the State’s
Attorney's Appellate Prosecutor of the State of Illinois for the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Appellate
Assistance Program. This eighth year of funding will enable the State’s Attorney’s Office to maintain 42
positions in the Criminal Appeals Division, specifically 37 assistant state’s attorney positions and five
support positions. Since 2003, the State’s Attorney’s Office has received funding from the State’s
Attorney's Appellate Prosecutor for the purpose of staffing the Criminal Appeals Division at a level that
better balances staffing between defense attorneys working on criminal appeals in Cook County and the
number of assistant state’s attorneys responding to those briefs. This grant does not require a match
contribution.
The authorization to accept the previous grant was given on December 1, 2009 by the Cook County Board
of Commissioners in the amount of $1,700,000.00.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: None. Grant Award: $2,050,000.00. Funding period: July 1, 2010 through

TRANSFER OF FUNDS

ANITA ALVAREZ, Cook County State's Attorney
by
RAYMOND BALCARCEL, Chief Financial Officer, Office of the State's Attorney

112

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 19, 2010
requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners to transfer funds totaling $250,000.00 from and to
the accounts listed below, for the payment of bills for courtroom transcripts and the purchase of office
supplies.
Reason:

The per page cost of courtroom transcripts provided by the Official Court Reporters is
determined by the State of Illinois. The most recent increase in these rates was a full 25%,
and was not provided for in the 2010 Budget. Despite our best efforts to ensure that only
essential transcripts are ordered, we find that the original appropriation is insufficient. In
addition, increases in the cost of supply items, along with the need to purchase large amounts
of CDs, DVDs, and print cartridges as a result of technological advances and the increased
use of videotaped interrogations, has caused us to spend more for office supplies than was
originally projected.

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
250-268: Although we have had concerns about this account for most of the year, by July 31 the
balance was down to $72,404.00, clearly indicating the need for a transfer. On June 30 the balance
was $191,367.00.
250-350: Although this account does not currently have a negative balance, after reviewing the
July 31 Trial Balance, our projections indicated the need for additional funds. At that point the
balance was $109,114.00. On June 30 the balance was $162,358.00.

2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
Accounts 217, 225, 240, 260, 263, 441: After reviewing the August 30 balances, and projecting
expenses through the end of the fiscal year, we have identified these accounts as having sufficient
surplus for transfer.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from.

113

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 19, 2010

None.
4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
250-217: This account is used for the travel expenses of witnesses brought in from out of town to
testify, and for the extradition of prisoners from other jurisdictions. Expenses this year have been
10% to 15% lower than originally anticipated, resulting in this surplus.
250-232: Postage expenses have been somewhat lower than previous years, at least partly due to
the increased use of electronic media.
250-240: Improvements in our IT capabilities have allowed us to do more of our printing in-house.
In addition, we have recognized significant savings by using the Cook County Digital Graphics
Department in place of private vendors.
250-260: With the exception of our Drug Diversion and Education Program, which accounts for
the majority of spending from this line item, in 2010 we virtually eliminated the use of outside
providers of professional services, resulting in this surplus.
250-263: This account provides for the hiring of outside counsel, primarily in civil cases where
special expertise is required or where potential conflicts of interest may exist. It is difficult to
predict these cases in advance, and 2010 costs have been slightly lower than original estimates.
250-441: In April of 2010 we went live with our new Ciber Law Elite CRIMES Case Management
System. Although we originally budgeted the first year of the contractual maintenance and support
for this system in 2010, since our final acceptance of the system did not take place as early as
expected, the annual payments will not begin until 2011.

BUREAU OF TECHNOLOGY

115

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 19, 2010
PROPOSED CONTRACT
Transmitting a Communication, dated October 12, 2010 from
R. STEVE EDMONSON, Chief Information Officer, Bureau of Technology
and
JAYE M. WILLIAMS, Chief Financial Officer, Bureau of Finance
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract and to execute a contract with
the Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA), Chicago, Illinois, to assist Cook County with
expediting the delivery of a Request for Proposal (RFP) for System Integration Services related to the
Countywide Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. The GFOA will also assist Cook County in
evaluating proposal responses, references, and qualifications.
Reason:

Cook County has chosen to adopt a single ERP solution to enhance their ability to integrate
across the County, and address the growing number of issues surrounding the current ERP
system which is fragile and no longer supported. The RFP allows Cook County to
objectively identify a qualified vendor to implement a Countywide ERP system. Subject
matter expertise is needed to expedite the delivery of an RFP that addressees the financial and
technical issues related to the Countywide ERP project.

Regarded as the leading expert on government ERP best practices, the GFOA is a non-profit organization
that provides Cook County the following benefits:
1.

Over 250 governments and public sector entities have chosen to use the GFOA gold standard
to assist their ERP projects and this will ensure a fair and transparent evaluation process,
leverage expert experience, realize significant cost savings, and help prepare Cook County to
meet business transformation challenges with industry leading solutions.

2.

As the leading source of information for public sector financial management, the GFOA staff
and recommendations are subject to the most stringent ethical, financial, and managerial
standards for the public benefit. The GFOA has no affiliation with any software or hardware
vendors, and serves as a completely independent agent for its government clients.

There is no other resource that provides the depth of knowledge in government ERP best practices, the
breadth of experience on large government ERP projects, the number of government ERP references, or
the ability to provide equivalent capabilities for less cost to Cook County.
The GFOA contract amount and term would not exceed $90,000 over six months and the County ERP
Project Team, which includes the Chair and Vice Chair of the Information Technology and Automation
Committee of the County Board, would like to immediately begin working with the GFOA as of the
expected October 19th Board approval date.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: not to exceed $90,000.00. (715-009-260 715/009-266 Account). Requisition
No. 000900019.
This item was included in the FY 2009 Capital Equipment Project approved by the Board of
Commissioners on June 2, 2009.
