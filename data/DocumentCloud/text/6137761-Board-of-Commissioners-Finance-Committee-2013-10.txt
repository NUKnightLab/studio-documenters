CHAIRMAN DALEY:

Good morning.

reconvened.

The presentation will be given by Commissioner Larry

Rogers.

MR. ROGERS:

Good morning, Chairman Daley,

and members of the Finance Committee.
For the record, my name is Larry

8
9

We will begin with the Board of Review.

Rogers, Jr.

I am the current Chairman of the Cook

10

County Board of Review.

I want to thank you for the

11

opportunity to speak on behalf of the Board of

12

Review, and on behalf of my fellow Commissioners,

13

Michael Cabonargi and Dan Patlak.
I am glad to report that our staff and

14
15

members of the President's budget team, led by

16

Andrea Gibson, have worked together in order to

17

develop an agreed plan on an appropriate budget

18

allocation for the Board of Review, in the amount of

19

$8,233,141.

20

executive budget recommendation for that amount.

21

We ask that you support the President's

Such a budget allocation is necessary to

22

allow the Board of Review to continue to serve the

23

homeowners and taxpayers of Cook County, as well as

24

those taxing jurisdictions who rely on an orderly

and timely property tax cycle.
We believe that funding our agency at

2
3

the President's recommendation, again at $8,233,141,

4

is the level of appropriation needed to allow us to

5

complete the current session in a timely fashion,

6

such that the second installment tax bills can be

7

mailed on time for the second year in a row, after

8

thirty-four years of late tax bills.
Are there any questions?

to say is that I know people are really excited in

Commissioner Sims.
Let me commend you also for the great

2
3

job you do in helping us inform your citizens of the

4

opportunity to appeal, and getting them out so that

5

they can take advantage of the opportunity and are

6

well aware of their right and abilities to challenge

7

any overassessments that they feel they have been

8

subjected to.
COMMISSIONER SIMS:

9

And thank your staff.

10

You have some wonderful staff people that come out.

11

They are very accessible and very courteous to the

12

people in trying to help them in this confusing

13

process.

14

MR. ROGERS:

Thank you.

CHAIRMAN DALEY:

Larry, thank you again to

16

you and your fellow Commissioners for the outreach,

17

as Commissioner Sims has mentioned.

18

I mentioned it to you and you said you

19

were going to provide to the Board the number of

20

appeals, and the success rate of the people who

21

appeal, whether it be individually, online, or at

22

the various meetings.

23

MR. ROGERS:

Sure -- again, we believe that

the access to the opportunity to appeal is the

MR. BERRIOS:

Good morning, Commissioners.

6

I am happy -- very happy to be here, and I sent

7

every Commissioner a package with my statement, and

8

what the Assessor's Office has done and what we will

9

be doing in the coming year.

10

During the 2010 -- just to compare

11

numbers -- we had a total of 331,798 appeals, of

12

which 281,896 were individuals; which was a twenty-

13

eight percent increase over the 2013 triennial.
Of those individuals that came in,

14
15

approximately seventy percent of them got changes

16

because they were able to come to our office and we

17

were able to sit down and take a look at not only

18

our records, but what they turned in to us.

19

able to help those individuals lower their

20

assessments.

21

We were

The other thing the Assessor's Office

22

has done -- we have made a diligent attempt, because

23

of the market and because of what has been going on,

24

the market is starting to come back, but it hasn't
________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

1

come back yet.

We made a large effort to make sure

2

that we came as close to the real market values that

3

are out there right now.

4

notices from us saw that the market values and the

5

market evaluations did come down.

Those of you who received

Our office has been working very hard

6
7

to make sure that we not only take care of the

8

individual taxpayers here in Cook County, but to

9

make sure that they are served.
As you can see, with our current

10
11

budget, we basically maintained what we had during

12

the last three budget periods.

13

difference we have is that we passed new legislation

14

in Springfield to go after the individuals who

15

commit exemption fraud, whether they take an extra

16

homeowner's exemption, a senior exemption that they

17

are not entitled to, or they take them on multiple

18

properties.

19

The only large

During the amnesty period that we have

20

in the bill, as of last week we were over a million

21

dollars that we have already billed individuals, for

22

individuals who had come in and voluntarily told us

23

that they had taken extra exemptions.

24

Just in the short period from June

until now, we have had people come in.

2

already billed over $1 million.

We have

Starting January 1 we go into the

3
4

second phase of this process.

That would be to go

5

after individuals who had multiple - multiple

6

exemptions.

7

are individuals out there that have taken five - six

8

- seven - ten exemptions that they are not entitled

9

to.

You have read it in the papers.

There

We will be able to go back and go after these

10

individuals for a six-year period.

They will pay

11

interest and penalties to the County, which will

12

help pay for the program.
All of the monies that will be

13
14

collected that are tax dollars will go to all of the

15

municipalities, the taxing bodies within that taxing

16

district.

17

revenues.

18

They will see an increase in their

The other thing the Assessor's Office

19

has done, which I am very proud of, and I am very

20

proud of all of the people who work with us, is that

21

we have been able to get the tax bills out on time.

22

A lot of the local taxing bodies have been able to

23

not go and get the tax anticipation notes, which

24

cost them more money in the long run.

They are

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 11

1

saving money.
The County is doing a very good job in

2
3

getting these bills.

I have to commend all of the

4

other offices that are involved in the tax process.

5

The one thing that we have all done, we have all

6

come together to make sure that this thing happens.

7

We are the beginning of the process.

8

With us and the Board of Review, we have been able

9

to take our system and make it work better and

10

faster and more efficient so that we can get these

11

bills out on time.

12

I know there was a question last week

13

on the tax fraud, as to the administrative hearings

14

that we may have to have.

15

tell you, after going through various jurisdictions

16

that go after these tax fraud individuals, they get

17

very few hearings.

18

the job.

19

in turn, let the taxpayer know, show them what is

20

the evidence that we have.

21

The one thing I have to

Generally, the investigators do

They put the record together and we will,

I can tell you in Florida and in

22

Michigan their percentage of hearings are less than

23

one percent of all of the individuals they go after.

24

We currently, at the Assessor's Office, have four
________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 12

1

attorneys that work within the office.

If the

2

volume turns out to be higher, then we will use the

3

internal hearing officers for that process.

4

not go out to the general public to get people to

5

come in and do this job.

We will

We will do it internally.

I am very proud of what the Assessor's

6
7

Office has done, and I am willing to take any

8

questions.
CHAIRMAN DALEY:

9

Joe, thank you for

10

clarifying that matter.

You will do the

11

investigations on the fraud, and there will be

12

internal attorneys.

13

administrative hearing officers?

They will be used or the

14

MR. BERRIOS:

Correct.

15

CHAIRMAN DALEY:

Just for clarification --

16

I know you have done this at the various meetings

17

and your staff has -- the percentage shows that it

18

has been successful, but the main equation is -- you

19

can bring the assessment, but it is the levies of

20

the various agencies -MR. BERRIOS:

21

That I can't control.

I can

22

control what the assessment should be.

As I have

23

always said, no one should pay more than their fair

24

share.

Their fair share is based on the assessment

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 13

1

on that piece of property.

I can't control the

2

rates, but I can make sure that the assessment on

3

that property is as close as possible to the real

4

market value.

That is what our job is.

CHAIRMAN DALEY:

COMMISSIONER SIMS:

7

Berrios, and thank you for the outreach that your

office does throughout the community in trying to

11

and to get their taxes paid.

has always been welcomed in all of the townships

anything more than what is fair.

your outreach, and the people that have come out

really know what they are doing, and they are doing

On the tax bills -- do you think we

can get accustomed to the tax bills as they have

will be the norm moving forward?

We will now have the

I appreciate the opportunity to update
you on our good stewardship of public dollars in

this budget cycle, some of our challenges and plans

11

for the future.

12

First of all, I want to thank you for

13

allowing me to realign our FY2013 budget during the

14

first thirty days of my administration to

accommodate my priorities for the office.

efficiency, and advocacy.

accuracy,

As keepers of the public land record,

20

our foremost statutory duty is to ensure that what

21

is presented to us is accurately recorded and

housing market.

As a government office responsible to
________________________________________________

 19

the taxpayers, it is also important that we do so as

2

efficiently as possible, using only the resources

3

needed to get the job done.
As you probably know, I actively

4
5

advocated over the past few months before the

6

General Assembly in Springfield, and was able to

7

pass three laws that will allow us to assist victims

8

of recording fraud and punish fraudsters.
Upon taking office, it was clear that

9
10

the first step was to do a broad assessment of the

11

office.

12

Top staff was directed to coordinate

13

in-depth analysis of our operations, including our

workflows, space utilization, hardware and software

15

needs, and our financial controls.

were needed to help prioritize our requests for

In response to the President's

request, twenty percent of our vacant positions were

3

cut.
We advocated receiving a $1.3 million

4

settlement from a "robo-signing" lawsuit won by

6

Attorney General Madigan.

7

to help assess and repair the damage to the public

8

record.

That money will be used

We turned over $1.1 million from our

9
10

Torrens fund to the County, with the hope that down

11

the road we can relocate our Torrens records.
Though we might have been able to make

the case for a truly flat budget, coming in below

"flat" shows that we are proceeding with integrity,

15

facts, and respect for the process, and for the

want to seek a change in State law to allow land

conveyance documents to be electronically recorded,

essentially unusable as far as us offering metrics

we can track to better promote revenue-generating

costly, but necessary, modernization.

The time is now to underwrite this

The digitization -- as each year

6
7

passed, more public records are at risk of

8

deteriorating to the point of nonusability.

9

to undertake a push to digitize our records going

We plan

10

back to 1871.

That is a move that will not only

11

protect the public record, but allow us to free up

12

physical space in our Chicago location.

13

Based on our workflow audit, we will

14

be aggressively implementing changes in the way we

15

perform our daily operations.

16

redundancies, unneeded papers and supplies, and free

17

up staff to focus on our core operations, and

18

bringing the second largest Recorder's Office into

19

the twenty-first century.

20

This will eliminate

We have challenges, and life would be

21

perfect if we didn't have them, but we look at

22

challenges as temporary setbacks and opportunities

23

to get it done right.

Our greatest asset in our office is

our human resources.

2

generations of institutional knowledge in our

3

workforce.

4

needed to do twenty-first century work; therefore, a

5

training room was instituted replete with staff,

6

computers, and programs to enhance their skill sets.

7

This enhancement has been well-received.

Some of them lack technology skills

The concourse level at 118 North Clark

8
9

We're lucky to have four

where extremely fragile documents are stored has a

10

very serious flooding problems.

There is flooding

taking place in areas that are occupied by our staff

and by the public.

13

Facilities and Capital Planning to seek solutions in

14

this area.

We are working diligently with

As you all are aware, I inherited a

15
16

Federal Monitor in light of previous unlawful

17

political discrimination-related issues in our

18

office.

19

monitoring actions in the past several months to try

20

to change a culture that has flourished for decades.

21

Much time has been spent in training staff,

At our very first meeting with the

22

State's Attorney and the Monitor, we were advised

23

that in order to reach substantial compliance we

24

would have to hire a part-time Director of
________________________________________________

 24

Compliance.

Later, we were told that we needed a

2

full-time one.

Of course, that impacted our budget.

We are in the throes of hiring

3
4

somebody for that position now, and we hope to have

5

somebody in place in the next few weeks.
At the end of the day, I am going to

6
7

start where I began.

Our mission is accuracy,

8

efficiency, and advocacy.

9

this is our blueprint.

In this budget request,

I invite you all to visit our new

10
11

website -- cookrecorder.com.

Sign up for our

12

property fraud alert.

13

several of the other County offices at their

14

outreaches, getting people's attention that this

15

fraud happens, and it happens to people in Cook

16

County and all across the United States.

We have been working with

We want to encourage veterans to

record their DD214s for safekeeping in our office.

19

I invite each of you to personally stop by my office

that also.

COMMISSIONER SIMS:

Thank you, Chairman

Daley.
Congratulations in changing that

7

office around, and in automating it and doing all of

8

the things necessary.

9

I have a question with regards to

10

someone being able to get a deed.

11

come into the office and say, "I would like a copy

12

of someone's deed"?

13

MS. YARBROUGH:

Can someone just

They can come in and ask

14

for a copy of a deed, sure, and they can pay for it.

15

They have to pay for it.

16

COMMISSIONER SIMS:

How do we know if

17

someone is coming to get a deed, if they are using

18

it for something good and not something bad?

19

MS. YARBROUGH:

We really don't know.

20

really don't know.

21

but that is not really related.

22

purchase a deed, they certainly can.

23
24

We

We do have a fraud department,
If someone wants to

When we are recording these documents,
that is what we are looking for, as it relates to
________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 27

1

fraud.

That is what the bill is that we passed in

2

Springfield has to do with it.

3

now, when we see something -- I say, "If it looks

4

like a duck and quacks like a duck, it probably is

5

one."

What we are doing

We have a file and refer opportunity

6
7

so we can have somebody else take a look at it.

We

8

are using the Administrative Law Judges to do this.

9

Once they say it is fraudulent, what we can do -- we

10

have to record it by law.

11

things.

12

is possibly fraudulent, we can put something in the

13

public record that says -- hey, look, that former --

14

whatever it was that was filed -- is fraudulent.

15

That is what we did.

16
17

We have to record these

But what we can do when we find out that it

We can't tell

who is coming for what.
Typically, what I found since I have

18

been in the office in talking to the other

19

Recorders, they kind of mindlessly file documents.

20

If somebody brings them a piece of paper and they

21

want it recorded, we are supposed to record it.

22

COMMISSIONER SIMS:

I asked that because I

23

got a bill that is not mine from my ex-husband.

24

hasn't paid his water bill.
________________________________________________

He

 28

MS. YARBROUGH:

1
2

Pesky things, those ex-

husbands.
COMMISSIONER SIMS:

3

And they said, because

4

I am on a Board for the City and the County, they

5

sent it to -- other than the scofflaw, they sent it

6

to me.

7

They said apparently you must still be on the deed

8

because it is showing up under your name.

I said I shouldn't even be on the deed.

MS. YARBROUGH:

9
10
11
12

Sure -- sure -- did you

check it?
COMMISSIONER SIMS:

I have

got to come to your office and see.

13

MS. YARBROUGH:

14

COMMISSIONER SIMS:

15

No, I didn't.

Please do.
Because I didn't know.

I thought once you filed for divorce --

16

MS. YARBROUGH:

17

Your name automatically comes up.

18

that you do that.

19

for free any time you like.

put your PIN number in and you will see your chain

not there any more.

4

It wasn't mine either.

COMMISSIONER SIMS:

It is

I guess I need to get

down to your office.

5

MS. YARBROUGH:

6

CHAIRMAN DALEY:

Please do.
There is more outreach

7

that we can do as Commissioners in informing each

8

one in our Districts.

9

COMMISSIONER SIMS:

If that has happened to

10

me, I imagine there is a lot of other people.

11

is why when I talked to the Water Department, I said

12

why is my name on there?

13

to the Recorder's Office and get a copy of the deed.

14

I said, "I can just go over there and just get it?"

15

They said, "Yes."

16

That

They said you can just go

I said, "Well, that's private."

MS. YARBROUGH:

No.

It is a public record.

17

It is the public record and you can come and get a

18

copy of it yourself -- or just look at it.

19

We are doing outreaches, as I

20

mentioned, because we have ran across all kinds of

21

fraud that people are perpetrating -- especially

22

upon seniors and people of color and in communities

23

where there have been a lot of foreclosures.

24

Channel 2 did an excerpt where this

house changing the locks on her door.

watching this happen.

and filed a fraudulent document.

5

it to the police department, the police didn't know

6

what they were really looking at.

7

to allow it to continue.

8

We talked to the police officer and that guy went to

jail.

Thank you.

COMMISSIONER BUTLER:

I have a question

21

relative to your technology needs.

I know that

22

Commissioner Fritchey is heading up a committee that

We know it is expensive.

There are so many patches to this

thing it is clunky.

11

we need the technology to do a better job.

It doesn't work very well, and

COMMISSIONER BUTLER:

12

As

My question is just

13

that.

Are you going to get the technology that you

14

need out of this new committee that has been formed,

15

and the $40 million that we are being asked to

16

spend?

17

MS. YARBROUGH:

To get back to the

Our employees are there and

4

people come to do searches down there as well in the

5

concourse level.
CHAIRMAN DALEY:

6

You said the location is

7

accessible; however, the fact that there is flooding

8

is not positive for you.
MS. YARBROUGH:

9

No, it is not positive at

10

all.

We get complaints from our customers as well

11

as our employees.

12

try to figure out -- maybe we can wall that area off

13

until they can come up with a fix.

14

be a very expensive fix.

We would love to move them out of the concourse

you.

I want you to know that the good work that

23

your office has done, and your staff, has been

24

phenomenal.

They worked with us to research the

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 33

1

properties in my District.

I don't know if I sat

2

down and told you the results of that, but due to

3

the research that your staff did, the City in turn

4

was able to turn over some property to the County at

5

no cost to the County.

6

So thank you for that.

important for us in our District to get that area

cleaned up and utilized again.

15

workshops you, yourself, show up.

staff shows up, but I appreciate it that you come

out to make sure that your face is seen and to

answer questions as well.

Thank

you for coming.
I want to echo some of Commissioner

11
12

Butler's comments on the technology piece.

As you

13

know, since you have been working on this land bank

14

before I even heard of it down in Springfield -- I

15

appreciate your help on that.
One of the things we found is that

16
17

there is so much public information for real estate.

18

Everything that is out there is public, but that

19

doesn't mean that anyone can actually use it.

20

you try to go out to some of these communities to

21

talk about this issue around foreclosure and vacant

22

buildings, they can't get hold of any of this

23

information.

24

of the ways she characterized it was -- she has got

4

5

is just making this soup better and better and

6

better.

7

I think she is doing a terrific job.

One

Everyone who puts input into it

We may pull stuff out of it to use in our

8

When we have been able to do, through

9

the limited technology projects that we have worked

10

on together with you and with the Assessor's office,

11

to pull some of that stuff out in a way that you do

12

visually.

13

you know how much that changes the conversation.

14

Everyone is then on the same footing and they can

15

actually engage in the conversation versus -- we

16

have all of the information and you guys just have

17

to listen.

18

So when you take a map to a community,

I really want to make sure that you

19

use this as an ally when you are going through the

20

technology process.

21

that from Lydia.

22

community organization or a person on the street

23

wants to find out about what is happening in their

24

neighborhood, who owns a building, all of that stuff

I know we will hear a lot about

But to make sure, if the average

1

to take this opportunity to talk about some of our

major achievements in 2013.
President Preckwinkle has identified

4

her four pillars:

improved services; fiscal

6

responsibility; accountability and transparency; and

7

innovative leadership.

8

this year have advanced the President's objectives.

We believe our achievements

The Bureau of Human Resources

9
10

continues to improve the hiring process.

We

11

continue to move toward achieving substantial

12

Shakman compliance, implementing a more transparent

13

hiring process.
We have made great strides in managing

14
15

employee absences, and have seen a significant

16

reduction in the use of sick time.

17

eliminated the delays that had existed for resolving

18

employee grievances at the third level, and are

19

anticipating significant progress this year in

20

negotiations of the 2012-2016 collective bargaining

21

agreements.

We virtually

22

With respect to hiring, we have

23

reduced the time it takes to hire an employee

24

another twelve percent in 2013.

This year we filled

over 250 positions for offices under the President

2

at an average time to fill of eighty-five days.

3

2012, the hiring process took ninety-eight days,

4

thirteen days longer.

5

significant support to the Health System in their

6

efforts to hire staff needed to implement the 1115

waiver, assisting in the hiring of approximately 300

positions.

utilize Taleo as our applicant tracking system, like

11

many other major employers.

12

have implemented several upgrades, and reconfigured

13

the way we use the tool.

14

have made the application flow easier and faster for

15

candidates, and have reduced the overall time it

16

takes for Cook County recruiters to post and

17

evaluate applications.

In the past year, we

These system enhancements

We have also established monthly user

19

group meetings to allow recruiters to collaborate on

20

best practices, make system design decisions, and

21

participate in training activities.

22

We continue to strive for substantial

23

compliance with the Shakman consent decree.

We

24

achieved a major milestone when our supplemental
________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 40

1

policies went into effect on August 1.

2

Supplementing the employment plan, these policies

3

are required to ensure that unlawful political

4

discrimination does not influence any other

5

employment actions so they lay out the processes for

6

such actions as transfers, reclassifications,

7

interim assignments, etcetera.

8
9

The Compliance Administrator's Office
is now monitoring our adherence to these policies,

10

and we anticipate that monitoring period will be

11

completed in the first quarter of next year.

12

We also implemented online employment

plan training.

15

to more to most employees at their desks; thereby

16

eliminating the need for face-to-face training,

17

making this annual requirement much more efficient.

With the help of our partners in

19

initiative, we provided training to almost 200

20

supervisors in offices under the President on the

in the inappropriate or unnecessary use of sick

2

time.
While we can't attribute this entirely

3
4

to this initiative, we believe that both the

5

reporting tool and the training have made a positive

6

contribution.
The Labor Relations Department has

7
8

three core functions:

collective bargaining,

9

grievance hearings, and advice and counsel to our

10

County offices and departments.

In 2013, we focused

11

on the first two of these functions.

12

negotiations for our ninety-five collective

13

bargaining agreements for the 2012-2016 cycle,

14

including a comprehensive analysis of our health

15

benefits.

We began

With regard to grievance hearings, we

16
17

have resolved over 160 grievances, and reduced the

18

amount of time from third-step hearing to decision

19

to under thirty days in ninety-five percent of our

20

cases.

21

Labor Relations for 2014 is looking to

22

advance the goals of 2013 of improving collective

23

bargaining and the grievance process.

24

of the 2012-2016 collective bargaining agreements

Negotiation

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 42

1

will continue, and our hope is to have substantial

2

negotiations completed with the larger bargaining

3

units by the end of the calendar year.
In 2014, we will continue our efforts.

4
5

While our budget request does reflect a slight

6

increase over last year's budget, most of this

7

increase is due to a shift in the $323,000 annual

8

cost of maintenance for Taleo from capital to our

9

operating budget.
Total headcount is increasing by

10
11

approximately three full-time employees.

12

additional headcount is needed to address three

13

areas:

14

and the ERP technology projects, each of which has a

15

significant HR component, as you heard during the

16

fiscal presentation; to increase the professional

17

staff in the Labor Relations Department to resolve

18

labor disputes more efficiently, as well as

19

advancing the third core function of labor --

20

providing advice and counsel to our County offices

21

and departments; and to have a person dedicated to

22

policy development and implementation.

you for approval in the first quarter of the year.

At this time, we'd be happy to answer
any questions you might have.

Thank you.

CHAIRMAN DALEY:

9

COMMISSIONER SIMS:

10
11

Vice Chair Sims.
Did you just say you

are going to outsource FMLA?
MS. LARKIN:

We issued an RFP a year ago --

12

over a year ago -- and received bids back to

13

outsource potentially three different things:

14

ordinary disability, which is currently managed by

15

the Pension Board; and workers' compensation.

16

FMLA;

After evaluating the proposals, the

17

evaluation team decided that outsourcing just FMLA

18

made economic sense at this time.

19

management will be outsourced to a third-party

20

administrator.

21
22
23
24

COMMISSIONER SIMS:

So FMLA case

Tell me exactly what

they will be doing?
MS. LARKIN:
our FMLA cases.

They will be managing all of

If we have an employee who needs to

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 44

1

apply for FMLA, they will get the paperwork in to

2

the vendor.

3

make sure that we are compliant with the applicable

4

laws and regulations.

5

FMLA time, the third-party administrator will have a

6

call center to take those calls.

7

it.

10

When somebody needs to take

They will track

They will provide us with reports.
Today, FMLA is pretty much tracked on

8
9

The vendor will do all of the review to

spreadsheets because we don't really have the
ability to do it in our JD Edwards system today.
COMMISSIONER SIMS:

11

Is that going to be for

12

both the County and the Forest Preserves?

13

that just going to be for the County?
MS. LARKIN:

14

We are anticipating it will be

15

the County and the Forest Preserves.

16

COMMISSIONER SIMS:

17

So it will be the total

County?
MS. LARKIN:

18
19

Or is

The Forest Preserves was part

of the evaluation committee.
COMMISSIONER SIMS:

20

Everything that happens

21

in the County, as far as human resources, also

22

happens for the Forest Preserves as well.

23

treating it as one system?

24

well?

Are we

Will they change as

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 45

MS. LARKIN:

1
2

For FMLA purposes or for

anything?

3

COMMISSIONER SIMS:

4

MS. LARKIN:

For anything.

I am not familiar with the

5

Forest Preserves' system requirements.

6

believe they use our JD Edwards system, so as the

7

payroll changes, and things like that, yes, they

8

will be part of that.
COMMISSIONER SIMS:

9

But I

I am happy to hear that

10

the Taleo system -- you guys are getting better at

11

figuring out how to make that, I guess, more --

12

MS. LARKIN:

User-friendly?

13

COMMISSIONER SIMS:

-- user-friendly for

14

people.

15

making for the recommendations -- I hope when you

16

say things are getting better that that is part of

17

the process that they are getting better.

18

I guess the choices that the system is

MS. LARKIN:

Yes.

We streamlined the way

19

candidates put information into the system.

20

streamlined our applications.

21

when you do that and you make it easier for people

22

to apply you get less abandonment of applications.

23

At the same time, we have also tried

24

We have

We are hoping that

to, through the establishment of the user groups -________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 46

1

right now it is offices under the President, the

2

Sheriff, the Health and Hospitals System, the Forest

3

Preserves, the Recorder of Deeds.

4

training the JTDC, who will also be joining Taleo.

5

So establishing these user group meetings really

6

helped everybody to bring their issues forward,

7

trying to make it look a little more cohesive on the

8

website.

We are currently

That is one of the next steps that we

9
10

are tackling so you don't have all of these separate

11

-- the Office of the Sheriff, the Office of the

12

Recorder -- who knows what "offices under the

13

President" even means.

14

how to make it even more presentable and easier for

15

people to understand.
COMMISSIONER SIMS:

17

MS. LARKIN:

19

nurses.

20

to save for tomorrow.

22
23
24

Has your time shortened

in your process for the hiring of nurses?

18

21

We are trying to figure out

We don't do the hiring for

I think that is a question maybe you want

CHAIRMAN DALEY:

You will be asking that of

the Bureau of Health.
COMMISSIONER SIMS:

I know that has always

been a problem.

MS. LARKIN:

I spent a lot of time down

2

there this year as we were helping them out while

3

they got staffed up.

4

two or three months, nurses is definitely where they

5

need to spend a lot of time.

have hired a nurse recruiter as a permanent position

in their HR organization.

13

In my short tenure there for

COMMISSIONER SIMS:
recruiting is the problem.

I believe that they

I don't think the
I think the problem is

the process.
MS. LARKIN:

Because of the collective

bargaining agreement?
COMMISSIONER SIMS:

The time it takes for

14

them to hire.

15

that they have to go through once a person has

16

filled it out -- maybe I should wait for them to

17

come to discuss that.

18
19

I don't know all of the processes

CHAIRMAN DALEY:

That would be for the

Bureau of Health.

20

COMMISSIONER SIMS:

21

tackle, unless you want to answer it.

22

MS. MEADOR:

You guys got enough to

I am Lisa Meador.

I am the

23

Deputy Bureau Chief of Human Resources and the

24

Director of Labor Relations.
________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 48

Commissioner, I can tell you that

1
2

under the collective bargaining agreement with the

3

nurses' union there are very specific itemizations

4

of how the posting must progress when there is a

5

vacancy.

6

bargaining.

This is sort of part of the collective

However, we have set forth a process

7
8

through an agreement with the nurses' union where we

9

can post a position for external applicants at the

10

same time.

So there is a pool that is generated.

11

They won't go to that pool of applicants until the

12

internal applicants' pool has been exhausted.

13

it does reduce some of that time in order to get

14

applicants in for processing.
COMMISSIONER SIMS:

15

But

When we look at this

16

budget, we see, in some departments -- I think it is

17

the Public Defender's Office -- where they have

18

positions that were still vacant and have not been

19

filled.
What seems to be the problem?

20

CHAIRMAN DALEY:

21
22
23
24

With leave, the Budget

Director.
MS. GIBSON:

If I may -- the Public

Defender has been working on hiring very recently.
________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 49

1

I don't believe there are that many vacancies left

2

in the Public Defender's Office.

3

recently taken a look at this.

I have just

They had a fair number of vacancies

4
5

this year, and they have been working over the past

6

month.

7

vacancies that I am aware of right now.
COMMISSIONER SIMS:

8
9

I think they are working on the last

I was trying to figure

out -- were they blaming Human Resources or is it

10

their failure to do what they needed to do -- where

11

was the problem and what was the hang-up.

12

not happening with anybody else.

13

allowed to hire, why does it take so long?
MS. LARKIN:

14

So it is

If they have been

They have a lot of positions

15

that they were hiring for this year.

Because they

16

are a largely union shop, they have a process that

17

they needed to go through, too, for their

18

promotions.

19

they had second interviews involved.

20

laborious process for them.

They also set up a process -- I think
It was quite a

Letitia Dominici worked closely with

21
22

them.

I think they are coming to the tail end.

23

can't even remember -- Letitia, do you know how many

24

positions?
________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

I

MS. DOMINICI:

1
2

I am Letitia Dominici,

Compliance Officer.
Commissioner, I worked at the end of

3
4

2012, beginning of 2013, with Mark Solack, the Chief

5

of Staff for the Public Defender's Office.

6

filled quite a few positions.

7

attorney positions.

8

probably in the thirties that they hired for.

They

They had entry-level

I think the numbers were

Right now they are filling positions

9
10

for investigator IIs and IIIs.

That is pursuant to

11

a collective bargaining agreement, of course, for

12

promotions.
Their line attorneys, their L-1s, L-

13
14

2s, L-3s, and L-4s, those are attorneys that are

15

subject to collective bargaining.
Again, as Lisa Meador said, it is

16
17

quite laborious in terms of the steps that you need

18

to take.

19

they went to the promotional interviews.

20

a comprehensive application process in addition to

21

Taleo.

They posted for transfers first.

Then
They have

I monitor them through that.
In addition, they have supervisory

22
23

positions, and they have just most recently filled

24

those.

1

COMMISSIONER SIMS:

Here is the problem

2

that I have.

3

and it is for in-house first -- I believe everything

4

should be done in-house, but that is just me --

5

should be posted for in-house first, then you go out

6

to the public.

7

that are doing the job are not promoted into those

8

positions and you end up going outside?

9

that happen?

10

If you have a position that you post,

How is it that in-house, the people

MS. DOMINICI:

How does

They go through the

11

interview process.

12

promotions, for attorneys, let's say, as an example.

13

They interview the attorneys who are internal first.

14

They have to score them.

15

they rank them.

16

recollection, they promoted internally individuals.

17

Let's say they post for the

They meet as a panel and

They have, to the best of my

Now going back to those line

18

assistants, the entry-level positions, those, of

19

course, come from the outside.

20

interviews this year.

21

they interviewed approximately ninety candidates.

22

For the second, about 124 candidates, which takes

23

quite a lot of time and effort.

24

individuals who have been working internally in the

They had two sets of

I believe for the first set

But there have been

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 52

1

Public Defender's Office who have been promoted this

2

year.
COMMISSIONER SIMS:

3

It seems to be a

4

countywide thing, and I don't understand it.

5

your explanation, but how somebody internally

6

doesn't automatically when they apply to those

7

positions don't get it, and you end up hiring people

8

from outside.

9

happens.

10

I hear

That is just amazing to me how that

MS. DOMINICI:

Commissioner, in some of the

11

collective bargaining agreements, most of them are

12

not straight seniority.

13

COMMISSIONER SIMS:

I am not just talking

14

about the Public Defender; I am talking about across

15

the board.

16

MS. DOMINICI:

Because of the employment

17

plans and the parameters with Shakman, in addition

18

to some of the terms in the collective bargaining

19

agreement, you have to interview the candidates and

20

you have to select the best qualified.

21

automatic straight seniority, where you would apply

22

for the position or the promotion and then the

23

senior-most person would be selected.

24

COMMISSIONER SIMS:

So it is not

Since you have said the

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 53

1

scoring system -- what if you had somebody that

2

scores pretty high, but the department head says --

3

yes, that person scored pretty high, but the person

4

that scored maybe a few points lower, I would prefer

5

to have that person.

6

or the director get an opportunity to say -- I would

7

rather not have that person; I would rather have the

8

second person.

9
10

Does the department supervisor

Do they get that opportunity?
MS. DOMINICI:

There is that flexibility

11

built into the employment where the department head

12

could select someone other than the highest-ranking

13

candidate by the panel.

14

rationale and a substantive reason for that.

15

But there has to be a

COMMISSIONER SIMS:

What if the person says

16

-- I feel like I can work with that person better.

17

Maybe there is something that they see in this

18

person that ranked really high.

19

know if I can really see that person as somebody

20

that we really want to work with here.

21
22

They said, I don't

Do they have that option to say that?
MS. DOMINICI:

They have that option, but

23

that, again, get scrutinized by myself and either

24

Terry Larkin or Maureen O'Donnell.

We can question

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 54

1

the department head as to why they didn't choose

2

that highest-ranked candidate.

3

a whim.

There has to be some rationale behind that.
COMMISSIONER SIMS:

4

It can't just be on

But people have to feel

5

like they can work with people.

If you hire

6

somebody, that is just like a Commissioner hiring

7

somebody in their office.

8

would hire somebody that is not going to work with

9

me.

There is no way that I

I would think that a department head would at

10

least have the option to say -- I don't want that

11

first person -- maybe I want the third person that

12

applied.
Maybe they didn't score well at all.

13
14

Maybe they don't have all of the -- maybe you have a

15

person that may have all of the educational part of

16

this, but they don't have -- let's just say this is

17

somebody who has done this work for twenty years.

18

They would say -- well, I'd rather have that person

19

than the person that has gone to college and has

20

maybe a master's degree and this person only has a

21

BA.
Do they have the option to take that

22
23
24

person?
MS. DOMINICI:

Yes, they do, Commissioner.

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 55

COMMISSIONER SIMS:

1

But you are

2

scrutinizing them on why they decided they wanted

3

that person, which means some people just say -- I

4

don't feel like going through that.

5

take the first person who is not who I really want

6

because I don't want to go through this with

7

Shakman.

8
9

I will just

That is my problem with Shakman.
MS. DOMINICI:

We look at their

justification when they send the paperwork to Human

10

Resources.

We have the option to either discuss

11

that with them or not.

12

communicate the rationale that you just stated, I

13

wouldn't have an issue with that.

If they are able to

14

COMMISSIONER SIMS:

15

CHAIRMAN DALEY:

16

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

Okay.

Commissioner Gainer.
Good morning, and

17

thanks for coming.

I have a couple of technical

18

questions, and then a broader question.
In reference to section five of the

19
20

appropriation resolution, what is the likelihood of

21

union employees receiving cost of living

22

adjustments?

23

aside in the likelihood, since it is noted that

24

nonunion employees shall also receive COLAs?

And what fiscal impact are we setting

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 56

1

Basically, are we prepared, if that is the outcome

2

of the collective bargaining?

3

MS. MEADOR:

We are in negotiations with

4

our unionized employees.

5

on the table that are addressing wages with some of

6

those groups.

7

complete negotiations for the 2012-2016 collective

8

bargaining agreement cycle by the end of the fiscal

9

year 2014, that is our goal, with which we have a

10

We have proposals that are

With regard to whether or not we will

very aggressive timeline on the table.

11

Whether or not that pans out is a

12

matter of what happens at the bargaining table.

13

that is our hope, yes.
COMMISSIONER GAINER:

14

The question was:

15

Have we set aside funds in case we end up giving

16

COLAs that impact this fiscal year?
CHAIRMAN DALEY:

17
18

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

23
24

Or are we not even

considering that?
CHAIRMAN DALEY:

21
22

With leave, the Budget

Director.

19
20

But

With leave, the Budget

Director.
MS. GIBSON:

We have made some assumptions

in the budget, yes.
________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 57

CHAIRMAN DALEY:

1
2

cover her question?
COMMISSIONER GAINER:

3
4

So we have the dollars to

What have we allowed

for ourselves?

5

MS. GIBSON:

It is subject to negotiations.

6

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

I am not asking what

7

the outcome is going to be.

8

the set-aside so we are not left with a bill that we

9

can't pay.
MS. GIBSON:

10
11
12

I am asking you what is

I can provide that detail to

you.
COMMISSIONER GAINER:

I understand.

If you

13

don't want to tell me, that's fine.

14

it for me afterwards.

15

made allowances, if we end up with what is a

16

reasonable expectation of what we may end up with?

The question was:

17

MS. GIBSON:

18

CHAIRMAN DALEY:

Commissioner, just for

clarification.

20

contract, that money has been --

22
23
24

If they come to us this March with a

COMMISSIONER GAINER:
wanted to know.

Have we

Yes.

19

21

You can provide

Great.

Great.

That is all I

That's fine.

Who does the furlough days apply to?
And how much do you think we will save by the
________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 58

1

furlough day?

That may be a question for Andrea or

2

maybe you guys; however you want to handle it.
MS. MEADOR:

3

If there is a shutdown day in

4

the budget, it is differentiated from a furlough day

5

because the entire County will be shut down.

6

are certain collective bargaining agreements which

7

would exclude those particular employees from having

8

that be an unpaid day.

9

list of those collective bargaining agreement, if

10

There

We can provide you with a

you like.
COMMISSIONER GAINER:

11

We have workers who

12

won't be working, but we still have to pay them

13

because their contract doesn't accept a shutdown

14

day?

15

MS. MEADOR:

Their contract has certain

16

provisions in it which provides, for example, that

17

they are paid for any holiday that is designated by

18

the County or the court.

19

that is designated by the court system, then they

20

would get paid on that holiday.

So if there is a holiday

21

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

22

Thanksgiving a court holiday?

23

CHAIRMAN DALEY:

24

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

Is the Friday after

Yes.
So certain employees

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 59

1

are paid on Court holidays.

It doesn't matter if

2

the County has decided to shut down?

3

MS. MEADOR:

That's correct.

4

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

There is also a

5

reference in section 8 of the proposed resolution,

6

it references employees on "other accounts" that may

7

be eligible for pension benefits, as determined by

8

the Pension Board of Trustees.

What group of

9

employees is that referring to?

What is the

10

determination of eligibility?

11

MS. LARKIN:

12

actual account and get back to you.
COMMISSIONER GAINER:

13
14

I would have to look at the

This is in section 8

of the appropriation resolution.
Have you guys looked at what are the best

15
16

practices for large employers, larger numbers of

17

days off, including sick days and holidays?

18

the cost to the County.

19

each?

20

have one day a month as a sick day?

Then

What does it cost us for

Is it fairly across-the-board that people

21

MS. LARKIN:

22

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

23

of a large employer?

24

MS. LARKIN:

For the unionized -- hours per

employee per year.

currently at 5.6.
COMMISSIONER GAINER:

10

I can pull that information.

MS. LARKIN:

12

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

Hours per employee

Per month, six times.
That would be the

13

average for the unionized workforce.

14

average for just large employers?

What was the

I can pull that information for you.
COMMISSIONER GAINER:

If we are giving one

18

day off month, isn't that giving someone seven and a

19

half or eight hours a month versus five?

20

MS. LARKIN:

21

of when they take it.

22

when they take it.

23
24

Yes, it is, but it is a matter
We only count it, obviously,

COMMISSIONER GAINER:
questions.

One is:

There is two

What do we offer?

And the

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 61

1

second is:

What are the people taking?

2

people get to cash out on their sick time when they

3

leave?
MS. LARKIN:

4

No.

Don't

We don't pay for sick

5

time.

I believe you can get pension credits for

6

that sick time, but I don't know the ins and outs of

7

that.
COMMISSIONER GAINER:

8
9

You get paid out for

vacation, but you don't get paid out for sick tie.

10

MS. LARKIN:

Correct.

11

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

Do we have the

12

unlimited ability to carry over vacation from year

13

to year?
MS. LARKIN:

14

No.

I believe the maximum,

15

once you have been here fifteen plus years, is forty

16

days.

17

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

Which is a lot.

So

18

from year to year, people get a certain number of

19

sick days?

20

MS. LARKIN:

That's correct.

21

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

Theoretically, you

22

can carry up to forty days with you.

23

your rollover or whatever --

24

MS. LARKIN:

That is either

It starts at twenty days.

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

I

think from zero to six years you can carry over

twenty days.

4

forty days.

5

7

9

Then seven to twelve -- I forget the

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

Then the max is

What is the average

amount of vacation time that employees here have?
MS. LARKIN:

I don't know that off the top

of my head.
CHAIRMAN DALEY:

If you can provide that

10

schedule, and to the questions that she had

11

previously on the carryover.

12

the average number of days.

13

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

The last question was

I am just trying to

14

get the total number.

If we have twelve sick days a

15

year; we have a certain amount of vacation per year,

16

which is an average.

17

County holidays are there?

Then we have -- how many

18

MS. LARKIN:

Twelve.

19

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

20

MS. LARKIN:

Twelve holidays --

But we don't have short-term

21

disability, which is something that I think, if we

22

were to look at employers, you would find that they

23

have short-term disability plans.

24

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

Didn't we just do a

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 63

1

short-term disability for maternity?
MS. LARKIN:

2

Yes.

We have a parental leave

3

policy.

4

situation, you need to be not working for thirty

5

days before your disability payments would kick in

6

from the Pension Board.

7

don't know the genesis of the one day a month on

8

sick time, my guess is that people can bank it up so

9

that if they end up in that type of situation they

10

can use that sick time for that thirty-day period.

I believe -- although I

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

11
12

If you found yourself having a health

What percentage of

people take a thirty-day leave based on illness?

13

MS. LARKIN:

I don't know.

14

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

It might be

15

interesting to think if that is the entire premise

16

for issuing a day a month.
MS. LARKIN:

17
18
19

I don't know if that was the

premise.
COMMISSIONER GAINER:

But I guess your

20

point of view is the reason that you think it is a

21

valid policy to get a day a month off is because

22

people can bank sick time in case they need to take

23

a longer leave.

24

actually use the longer leave?

My question is:

How many people

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 64

1

MS. LARKIN:

I understand your question.

2

CHAIRMAN DALEY:

On page 395, they have a

3

list of the days vacation and the max days you can

4

take.
COMMISSIONER GAINER:

5

That is where I was

6

going with that.

7

twelve holidays, that is twenty-four days in a

8

calendar year.

Then you have anywhere --

MS. LARKIN:

9

Four personal days.

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

10
11

If you have twelve sick days plus

days?
MS. LARKIN:

12

You earn a personal day a

13

quarter.

14

are on the payroll December 1.

15

Plus four personal

Then you have a floating holiday, if you

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

So you have five

16

personal days, a floating holiday.

17

at your discretion?

18

MS. LARKIN:

19

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

20
21
22
23
24

You can take it

Correct.
What do you get a

personal day for?
MS. LARKIN:

Personal days are designed for

nonvacation-related activities, for example.
COMMISSIONER GAINER:
four plus five.

So we have twenty-

We have twenty-nine days off before

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 65

1

you have ever started to take vacation time.

2

Theoretically, twelve of those are sick days.

3

most people have between ten and thirty vacation

4

days.
You start out with two weeks when you

5
6

Then

start out as an employee?
MS. LARKIN:

7

You start accruing.

When you

8

start working for the County, you start out with

9

nothing.

10

You start accruing days as you work.

In

that first year, you don't have it.
COMMISSIONER GAINER:

11

But the allotment for

12

someone who is a beginning employee is two weeks

13

vacation?

14

MS. LARKIN:

15

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

16

jump up beyond that?

17

MS. LARKIN:

Ten days.
How quickly does it

First through six years, ten

18

days; seven through fourteen is fifteen days.

19

fifteen years plus is twenty days.

20

the hospital system has a much larger vacation

21

accrual than we do elsewhere.

22

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

23

MS. LARKIN:

24

Then

I might add that

Why is that?

I can't answer that question.

A lot of folks get five weeks walking in the door,
________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 66

1

so there is a difference.
COMMISSIONER GAINER:

2
3

Medical and

nonmedical get five weeks?
MS. LARKIN:

4

There are K-12s and their

5

grade 24 equivalents automatically get five weeks.

6

Then their schedule is more generous than ours in

7

terms of what they give the first through fourth

8

years.
COMMISSIONER GAINER:

9

That is not just for

10

doctors and nurses, the medical personnel.

11

even for the administrators, the secretaries, people

12

who work in their budget office?

13

MS. LARKIN:

14

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

Yes.
They design their own

15

HR policies?

16

are not looking to align those two things?

20
21

I thought you guys were involved.

MS. LARKIN:

policies.
COMMISSIONER GAINER:

Has there been talk

at all about aligning those together?
MS. LARKIN:

They are independent with

their Board.

23

ours, but some of them diverge.

24

That is

A lot of their policies do align with

Have we determined

It just seems like a staggering number

2

of days off when you have to run a twenty-four-hour

3

a day, seven-day-a week operation, to give it right

4

off the bat.

5

best practices are and compared it to that and

6

looked at the cost differential?

Have you guys looked at what the other

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

9

Not in any great detail, no.
Maybe we can work on

that.
I asked the question of the Risk

11

Management Department, so I will ask you guys, too.

12

Obviously, there are many of us who have heard a lot

13

of feedback on the collective bargaining agreements.

14

I won't ask you to comment on them here, since you

15

are in the middle.
One of the things that has come up is

16
17

healthcare.

18

an overarching vision of the type of healthcare the

19

population has, all of those things we like to buy

20

for our employees.

21

I just wondered if we had some sort of

MS. MEADOR:

Commissioner, I can tell you,

22

from a general perspective, we have some very

23

specific goals with regard to addressing healthcare

24

moving forward.

The biggest one is mitigating the

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 68

1

high-value plan tax under the Affordable Care Act;

2

the Cadillac tax, as it is commonly referred to.
We are also looking to move our plan

3
4

closest to our competitors, our local competitors --

5

the City of Chicago, the State -- on bringing ours

6

more in line with other public sector entities.

7

plan is much more rich.
We are also looking to address

8
9

Our

wellness, and give wellness participation, and have

10

our employees join in our efforts to get a

11

healthcare population.

12

selection.

Then also to defer adverse

For example, currently our employees

13
14

do not pay for dental or vision coverage.

looking at people making selections where they may

16

elect for certain coverage, if they don't utilize

17

it.

18
19
20

We are

We are looking to address that.
Those are our main goals in looking at

our healthcare plan.
COMMISSIONER GAINER:

Did we ever, in the

21

course of managing the Cadillac tax -- which is

22

going to be an onerous obligation for us as an

23

employer as well as for individuals because they

24

will be bearing it, too -- did we look at utilizing
________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 69

1

any of the corporate exchanges, the private

2

exchanges that have been introduced to the public?

3

Towers has one, AON has one, Blue Cross has one.

4

Not the public exchange, but a large exchange that

5

is targeted to the large employers.
MS. LARKIN:

6

At this point, that is not a

7

matter that we have reviewed extensively; mainly

8

because our plan, or the design, etcetera, is based

9

on our collective bargaining agreement.

There is

10

only so much change that we can put on the table.

11

The changes that we are looking at are quite

12

aggressive.

going to now.

COMMISSIONER BUTLER:

Good morning.

I

received, about a week ago, a letter from the Bureau

3

of Economic Development, the Planning and

Development Department.

5

eight career service employees' layoffs representing

6

a third of the Department workforce, an average of

7

sixteen and a half years of employment with the

County.

9

represent constituents in each one of the Districts

They are speaking about --

It says, "The individuals laid off

10

of the Commissioners receiving this letter" -- which

11

I guess was about five or six of us.

12

Additionally, the laid-off employees

13

were responsible for managing and administering CDBG

14

funds for an overwhelming number of poorer

15

communities in Cook County; mainly located in the

16

south suburbs.

17

All but one of the employees is a

18

minority or a person of color.

19

find a copy of the letter.

20

Attached, please

I don't want to go into that as much

21

as I want to find out what is a Commissioner

22

supposed to do?

23

I received a letter from the Office of the Inspector

General who says that any conversations or

Because prior to this conversation

communications about hiring or firing should be

brought to this Office before, or reported to this

office at some point in time.
I don't want to be under that kind of

gun.

I want to understand what am I supposed to do,

6

and where am I supposed to do it, because I think it

7

is very important to me and my constituents, and I

guess for the general knowledge of the people that

9

we work for, which is the people of Cook County.
MS. LARKIN:

10
11

I am not sure I understand

exactly what you are asking, Commissioner.
COMMISSIONER BUTLER:

12

I am asking you when

13

do we have to report a communication of this type,

communications between a constituent and his elected

I think, to the best of my

recollection -- you would have to address that

question to Herman Brewer.

being done by those employees no longer exists.

If you receive a letter of this nature that

addresses layoffs in a department, you have every

right to reach out to the department head and say,

"I have been placed on notice that there is a layoff

in your department.

Can you please explain what was

behind that layoff?

How many individuals were laid

You can then take the opportunity to

explain to that constituent that there was a layoff

in the department and these are the reasons why

there was the layoff, and you should look to the

postings in HR to determine if there is an

MS. FELICIONE:

The help that you can

provide them, if you would like to, is to explain,

that individual by finding them other employment in

I would think, in a

nursing situation -- let's say a nurse was laid off.

The nurse says, "There is a position over at

Provident or Oak Forest."

They could just go to

that place and take employment.

to ask -- so let me get back to this.

ask the cost of the vendor contract for the FMLA.

COMMISSIONER MURPHY:

When you say a

"monitoring period", are we talking about years of

21

monitoring?

MS. LARKIN:

No.

The monitoring period is

23

when you talk to the Compliance Administrator.

is usually a minimum of six months.

But if there

are significant process issues that come up during

the process of that monitoring, they find things

would expect the monitoring period to go on longer.

With respect to job

descriptions, we have a small group of three people

in our organization that work with the departments

we know what was going on before.

been a real, real problem.

5

What I have been told, rewriting the

job descriptions and whatever amendments needed to

be made with the personnel code, after -- after we

had gone through and identified all of the people

that were a part of the lawsuit, the grievance that

was filed against us.
Those were all weeded out.

We

13

determined who they were and, of course, we had to

14

make a settlement of a class action suit, which is

15

what it was.

16

that period is over, it is simply down to our being

able to do the rewriting of the job descriptions so

there were no problems or conflicts as it related to

whatever changes they needed to make within the

personnel code.

21

years.

22

We had to make a settlement.

Once

That has taken four years - four

The other thing that I am concerned

23

about is why are we not moving forward?

Now the

24

excuse is the healthcare system hasn't done what

are some job descriptions with political

considerations, and for the exempt job descriptions

as well.

just saying there are stipulations -- what we have

18

to work out with Shakman -- how many jobs and what

19

jobs are considered exemption positions and whether

20

or not they are exempt positions.

With Shakman, there

I don't want to talk about those.

I am

All of those things by now should have

21

been taken care of.

Those are the holdups because

23

we are trying to get more exempt positions than is

necessary.

Of course, we had not done the job

I would like to

The Offices under the

23

President, we are currently running at about 5.7

24

sick hours per employee per month.

So less than a

day.
COMMISSIONER SCHNEIDER:

2
3

Less than a day

per month?
MS. LARKIN:

4

Right.

Per employee on

5

average.

We created this Web-based tool because our

6

current JD Edwards system is not user-friendly when

7

it comes to trying to monitor employee behavior and

8

trying to identify if you might have a pattern of

9

abuse.
We created a tool that we have been

10
11

training -- mandatory training for all supervisors

12

this past year.

13

and the supervisors a list of every sick time that

14

their employees have taken.

15

absence profiles that would be kind of "patterns of

16

abuse profiles".

17

after a holiday -- using one sick day every month,

18

an earner and a burner.

It basically gives the department

We developed some

Mondays and Fridays -- before and

We run this program against those

absence profiles every month.

21

they can go look at the absence pattern of those

employees.

We have a list and

Now, it could be that somebody falls
on that list and there is no abuse going on at all.

been doing that?

10

MS. LARKIN:

Since December of 2012.

11

COMMISSIONER SCHNEIDER:

December of 2012

12

you have been tracking.

It sounds like you are

13

doing a pretty good job of tracking that.

14

it is a valuable tool as we move forward in

15

understanding the value of really good employees and

16

those that may not be quite as diligent in their

17

work.
Let me go back.

18

I think

If you say they take

19

5.6 hours a month, that would equate to probably

20

seven days a year?

21

MS. LARKIN:

Correct.

22

COMMISSIONER SCHNEIDER:

Is that about

23

right?

Seven out of twelve days per year they are

24

basically using this, most employees?
________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 102

1

MS. LARKIN:

Right.

2

COMMISSIONER SCHNEIDER:

Another thing I

3

wanted to ask you.

Since eighty to eighty-five

4

percent of the County budget is employees' salaries,

5

benefits, pension-related, I sometimes find it odd

6

that we can go one or two or three years sometimes

7

not even knowing about a contract until it comes

8

before us at the Board on an agenda item and we

9

would say we just approved a contract with this

10

designation -- the Sheriff, the custodians, this,

11

that, or the other.
Is there any value in the

12
13

Commissioners receiving -- or is it delivered and I

14

don't know it from the Labor Committee, because I am

15

not on the Labor Committee -- like a quarterly

16

update on where we are in our labor negotiations?

17

Is that something that would be valuable to us?

18

you think that would be a piece of garbage because

19

you are always in flux and you don't know where you

20

are at?

Do

I think it is something that

21
22

Commissioners should know where we are at in the

23

process.

24

an aggressive goal to finalize an agreement from

I think you said at the end of 2014 it is

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 103

1

January, 2013, to 2016.

2

something like that, we would know maybe if we are

3

ahead or behind in that curve, and where we are in

4

our negotiations, where the employees' unions are,

5

and where the County is, and where we are hopefully

6

going to meet.
MS. MEADOR:

7
8

At least if we got

Lisa Meador, Director of

Labor.
We would be happy to provide some

9
10

information quarterly as to the status of

11

negotiations.

12

information that we can provide as the actual

13

negotiations is not public information, particularly

14

in light of the ground rules that are established

15

with our larger unions.

Obviously, there is limited

If you feel it would be of value --

16

COMMISSIONER SCHNEIDER:

17

Is it possible to

18

meet privately so that we can understand what that

19

is?

20

this should possibly be confidential information

21

that is distributed to the Commissioners.

22

go beyond that, if I met with, let's say, someone in

23

your Department privately to see where we are at and

24

where the discrepancies are?

Let's say I would want to meet -- I would say

Would it

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 104

I believe that collective bargaining

1
2

has to be one of the most complex issues in this

3

County.

4

and everything, with everything -- with the Cadillac

5

insurance coming in -- how you are negotiating all

6

of that.

7

coverage and how that relates to what their pay is

8

going to be.

9

stuff, all combined; it has got to be an incredible

10

I can't imagine, with all of the benefits

You obviously can keep the same health

The leave, the sick time, all of this

jumble, a pot that you have to navigate through.
To me, it is interesting, and it is

11
12

also very important to me as a Commissioner knowing

13

where we are at.

14

percent of our County budget goes to employees and

15

related matters.

16

As I said, eighty to eighty-five

MS. MEADOR:

Approximately a little bit

17

over eighty percent of our employees are unionized.

18

So it is significant.
It has been a challenge because the

19
20

prior cycles have been so prolonged in negotiations,

21

which I think is not the best way to negotiate

22

contracts.

It is not an ideal way to address your

23

employees.

It is not an ideal way to manage, from a

24

management perspective.

You have got contracts that

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 105

1

are already expired.
Our goal is to reverse that trend, and

2
3

it is just taking time.

4

2016 cycle, we have a lot on our plate, particularly

5

with regard to healthcare, work rules, and obviously

6

the wage component that pairs up against those

7

issues.
I am happy to provide a timeline as to

8
9
10

We have -- in the 2012 to

where we are with our negotiations.

If you said

that would be helpful, I will be happy to do that.
I think it is certainly, from my

11
12

perspective, it would be of value for you all to be

13

aware of where we are or where we are progressing.

14

It is difficult, I think, for you to know what

15

challenges and obstacles that we face, what affects

16

the timeline, and why it might be delayed in certain

17

aspects, with certain contracts.

18

COMMISSIONER SCHNEIDER:

19

And your report

would let us know that?

20

MS. MEADOR:

Yes.

21

COMMISSIONER SCHNEIDER:

That would be very

22

valuable to me, and I would appreciate that, if you

23

can do that.

24

that I wanted, I can meet with you privately on

Then if there is anything beyond that

anything like that; right?

MS. MEADOR:

CHAIRMAN DALEY:

On any specifics; right?

Within certain parameters.
It will be submitted to

4

you as well as to the Chair so we can distribute it

5

for the record.
MS. MEADOR:

6

Obviously, within certain

7

parameters.

I am not permitted to disclose

8

specifics of the negotiations.

9

provide information as to the timeline, the groups,

10

and where we are moving.

11

that may throw up obstacles.

But, yes, I can

Like I said, on issues

COMMISSIONER SCHNEIDER:

12

Are specifics of

13

the negotiations available to the Commissioners

14

individually?

15

us?

As to the proposals that are

on the table, I cannot.

18

COMMISSIONER SCHNEIDER:

MS. MEADOR:

The President's Office is aware, and

ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 107

2

rules with the unions when we conduct negotiations.

3

Part of those ground rules limit what we can share.

4

But I am happy to go through that in detail with

5

you.

6

We enter into ground

We can work out what we can discuss.
COMMISSIONER SCHNEIDER:

I appreciate that.

I also believe that it is fairer to

7
8

the taxpayers and to the employees of the County

9

that we don't negotiate these contracts at the end

10

of the term of the contract.

11

budgeting sake, the employees, instead of getting a

12

windfall after four years, why don't they know what

13

they are going to be earning so that they can use

14

that money during that time?

15

we go to budget perhaps for 2015 and 2016, we know

16

what to include in that budget for wages, salaries,

17

and benefits.

18

Even for their own

Then when we know, and

As Commissioner Gainer said earlier,

19

have we put the money aside for what we may

20

contemplate to be the negotiated settlement?

21

good to hear when Andrea said that we had.

22

would be better if we had that contract and we knew

23

what that number was.

24

MS. MEADOR:

Absolutely.

It was
But it

We have just

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

contract, and it rolled right into negotiating the

3

2012 to 2016, which we are doing now.

4

get those completed, at least with the large unions,

5

by the end of 2014, so that we can then for the next

6

cycle be negotiating the year before the contract

7

expires, not after the contract has expired.

great.

The last question -- do we have any

13

have we satisfied everything up to 2012?

the preference for veterans to get an interview

MS. LARKIN:

10

Commissioner, the status is we

11

have a process put in place.

We have worked with

12

Bill Brown to make sure we understand the

13

appropriate documentation we should be looking at.

14

We have submitted it as an amendment to our

From the plaintiffs, we just got their

17

responses back last week.

amendments to the plan.

within the next two weeks, and we will be ready to

We expect to be able to wrap that up

As far as it relates

23

to our ordinance, the fact is that the ordinance is

MS. LARKIN:

The ordinance is in effect.

life, we have to incorporate it into our plan.
COMMISSIONER REYES:

5

What happens to the

6

individuals, due to -- the fact that the ordinance

is in effect governs, is that right?

8

going to miss those opportunities because the jobs

9

are going to be filled while the ordinance is in

11

13

effect.

But they are

Where does that leave them?
MS. LARKIN:

It leaves them under the same

process that we are currently working, Commissioner.
COMMISSIONER REYES:

So, in reality, the

14

ordinance is worth as much as the paper that it is

15

on; is that correct?

16

MS. LARKIN:

At the present time, but I

17

expect that to change pretty quickly.

18

COMMISSIONER REYES:

I think that is wrong.

19

We passed it.

This Board approved it.

Now veterans

20

are in the trick bag because of the issues that you

just stated.

me to do that under the employment plan the way it

That is why we need to amend

it.

is an effective useful tool?
MS. LARKIN:

We do.

I will tell you, even

13

if we didn't have Shakman, we would still want to

have an applicant tracking system in place.

in an ambulatory care clinic that lasted a year from

that there were problems like that, and that they

10

have had challenges in posting things out of the

sheer volume of vacancies that they aspire to post

Good morning, Mr. Chairman,

and Commissioners.
From the attacks at the Boston

6
7

Marathon to those at the shopping mall in Nairobi,

8

Kenya, which was four weeks ago today, we continue

9

to face serious threats as both a nation and as a

10

global community.

The destructive force of natural

11

events, such as the severe weather that impacted

12

Cook County in April, is an equally powerful

13

reminder of the diversity of the challenges that

14

confront us, and our need to be prepared for all

15

incidents, whether manmade or natural.
Over the last twenty-nine months,

16
17

under the leadership of President Preckwinkle, and

18

thanks to your support, the Cook County Department

19

of Homeland Security and Emergency Management has

20

focused on building the relationships and creating

21

the infrastructure to be a key partner in working to

22

protect against, respond to, and recover from all

23

hazards.

24

made strong progress in our efforts to address them.

While our challenges are diverse, we have

14

the efforts we are making regionally, they are aware

21

it specifically earmarked for a particular project?

22

Or could it be based off of your direction?

24

MR. MASTERS:

Let me say this:

Upon

arriving at the Department there was what was known
________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 132

1

as an Urban Area Working Group, which was the

2

federally-mandated structure to manage these funds.

3

The Urban Area Working Group was a finding of the

4

DHS Office of the Inspector General audit related to

5

the State and our urban area.

Director Schenkel and I, we completely

revamped how UAWG functioned to make it more robust.

8

We are continuing to tweak it.

opportunities out for all of our suburban

10

jurisdictions, allowed them to apply for funds, and

say the same thing about you.

Everybody seems to

I have one question.

4

Maybe I wasn't

5

here when you were talking about reserves.

The

6

thing that happened, which you don't have, is the

7

control over how many floods we are going to have,

8

how devastating they may be, or how destructive they

9

may be.

That is running out of money.
One of the things that hurt me so

10
11

badly in 2008, and then it came back.

12

finished 2008, and then 2010 came up with all of

13

those floods.

14

We hadn't

They seem to get worse.
Let me ask this question first.

Is

15

there any way that Homeland Security can help with

16

the infrastructure that will help local

17

municipalities linking in with even the Water

18

Reclamation Board to do something about the

19

continuous flooding over and over?

20

It seems to me that we would spend

21

less money in the long run if we could just come up

22

with the money.

23

across the country to try and get those targeted

24

areas where we spend an enormous amount of money?

What can Homeland Security do

The last time, in 2010, we left a lot

Are you reserving any money for just

in case we really have a serious disaster when it

comes to flooding so that will never happen again?
I literally had tears in my eyes.

MR. MASTERS:

I think the adage "an ounce

17

of prevention is worth a pound of cure" is certainly

18

true in the emergency management world.

19

your second point, Commissioner, the multihazard

20

litigation plan that I referenced in my opening

21

remarks is certainly one that is working to address

the problem that you have highlighted.

When we arrived at the Department, the

execute that plan, but had not done so.

Those mitigation funds allow the

I will continue to keep you and your

If you run out of

money, what do you do for the mitigation?
MR. MASTERS:

are referring to -- correct me if I am wrong,

Commissioner -- is that which is made available

through individual assistance.

I can get back to you as to the total

9

In the floods in April, for instance,

10

we have had 78,000 claims filed here in Cook County

11

with FEMA, which is an indication of the devastation

12

of that storm.

13

positive to that is that we have got a lot of

14

feedback and greatly improved the communications

15

with our local jurisdictions, so the residents know

16

to apply and how to do so.

17

But it is also a positive.

COMMISSIONER COLLINS:

The

When you add it up

18

and you look at each of the requests, in dollars,

how far off are we with coming up with the adequate

funds to address those problems?

The Federal

Commissioner Reyes.
Thank you, Mr.

Chairman, and good morning, Mike.
I am looking at your FTE positions.

9
10

You are asking for a two position increase; is that

11

correct?

12

MR. MASTERS:

Yes, sir.

13

COMMISSIONER REYES:

You are eliminating

14

the two administrative assistants, II and III, and

15

combining it into a IV?

COMMISSIONER MOORE:

Thank you.

Commissioner Moore.
Can you explain to me

16

-- out of the seventy-four applications for aid from

17

FEMA, how many of those applicants actually receive

18

funding here in Cook County?

19

MR. MASTERS:

It is going to depend on how

20

the Federal Government finally lines up addressing

21

the entire program.

22

that we received from FEMA, it is actually up to

23

78,000 referrals, sir, with an approved amount of

24

roughly $109 million.

As of this morning, the email

We are seeking an update

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

based on that new number that we received this

2

morning from FEMA as to how much available funding

3

will be made to the County residents.

4

COMMISSIONER MOORE:

Also, in the case of a

5

weather-permitting emergency -- should the village

6

apply for relief from your office or from IEMA or

7

from FEMA?

8
9

I am still confused about that.

MR. MASTERS:

It is a great question, sir.

We have been working very diligently to try to

10

clarify that for our jurisdiction.

11

people would basically send it in to everywhere they

12

could, so that as a jurisdiction they want to make

13

sure that everybody gets it.

14

Previously,

What we are working to do is to really

15

streamline that process.

16

individual assistance and public assistance.

17

public assistance, or the PA, is for the costs borne

18

by the jurisdiction itself.

19

instance, the public works agencies to be out

20

cleaning roads and debris and things like that.

21

individual assistance, which is really for an

22

individual or a business that has flooding and major

23

damage, etcetera.

24

There is two forms of aid,
The

The cost of, for

We have worked very diligently with
________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

The

 141

1

IEMA, the Illinois Emergency Management Agency, over

2

the last two years to clarify the chain of command

3

to the local jurisdictions.
So, by and large, what we saw in April

4
5

was everyone coming through us, for the most part.

6

We were categorizing and cataloging all of the data,

7

and then getting it off to IEMA, and then working

8

with IEMA to get it to FEMA.
The damage assessment team process,

9
10

the preliminary damage assessment team process,

11

which was created from that, was a cooperative.

12

was really us with the State, with the Federal

13

Government, and the local jurisdictions.

It

I think the closer you get to the

14
15

local jurisdictions the better because they know

16

where the damage is and they know where the problems

are.

COMMISSIONER MOORE:

1

So, Director, can you

2

walk me through -- if a village gets flooded, their

3

first point of contact should be to call your

4

office?
MR. MASTERS:

5
6

sir.

That is what we want

them to do?
MR. MASTERS:

9
10

Yes, sir.
COMMISSIONER MOORE:

7
8

That is what we encourage,

do.

That is what we want them to

Our Duty Desk, which is 24/7, 365 days a year.
There is a few reasons for that.

11

Let

12

me step back a bit.

13

coming, we already are going to be spinning up as

14

agency like we did in April this past year, and

15

started to do conference calls with all of the local

16

jurisdictions -- police, fire, and emergency

17

management.

18

If we know that the weather is

We know historically where it floods

19

in this County.

20

that we weren't using that information previously to

21

try to pre-position and deploy our assets.

22

It was somewhat mind-boggling to me

So what we worked to do, a lot of the

23

things we brought on board were generators and

24

portable water pumps.

We worked with the

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 143

1

jurisdictions that we know historically flood, and

2

we get that equipment to them ahead of time so that

3

their 911 center, or their reservoir doesn't topple

4

over because they don't have a generator or they

5

don't have a water pump.
We start the communication very early,

6
7

and we have been.

We encourage those jurisdictions

8

to contact the Duty Desk to let us know if there is

9

anything they might need, in terms of assets.

And,

10

certainly, with reporting, speak to us and we will

11

work with them, the State, and FEMA.

12

COMMISSIONER MOORE:

This past April we had

13

heavy rains.

14

Burnham and you know we have a golf course there,

15

and it stays flooded.

16

at the Mayor's Office and it was so bad that I

17

literally had to drive across the grass to get to

18

the Mayor's Office because the streets were flooded.

19
20
21

One of the villages in my District is

I was on my way to a meeting

Did they receive or apply for any
relief from your office?
MR. MASTERS:

I can follow up with you

22

specifically as to whether they applied for PA,

23

public assistance, with us.

24

they are definitively a participant in the

I can tell you that

They have signed on to

I would be very surprised if they

4

hadn’t been engaged or involved in some form or

5

another with us in our efforts on the flooding

6

information.

COMMISSIONER MOORE:

7

Get back to me.

The last thing is for the individuals.

8
9

I can get back to you.

I go to a lot of community meetings and the people

10

are upset because their basements are flooded.

11

of them are in the City and some of them are in the

12

County.

13

City, not us?

14

Some

But in the City they should apply with the

MR. MASTERS:

That is correct.

We have a

15

very strong process with the City of Chicago.

16

Usually the residents will go through 311 and apply

17

from the City.
I want to be clear -- when they are

18
19

applying for individual assistance, they should be

20

going through their local jurisdiction as well.

21

local jurisdiction then comes to us.

The

The local jurisdiction gathers the

22
23

information.

We send them out the forms.

24

them out everything they need.

We send

information gets logged by the jurisdiction, the

as well as with the State and FEMA.

4

COMMISSIONER MOORE:

When people apply

5

individually to your Department, if they live in the

6

County, do we award them the aid?

7

processed to FEMA and FEMA awards the aid?

Or is that

8

MR. MASTERS:

9

COMMISSIONER MOORE:

10

It is not in our budget to award aid?

11

MR. MASTERS:

FEMA awards the aid.
We never award aid?

Correct.

We do not.

There

12

have been times where those grants have run through

the County, contrary to national best practice.

Are they saying the terrorists

is truly something that seems like it is really

dangerous.

If so, at what point will

our people as to whether there are any terrorist

implications.

My understanding is it is essentially

10

components that they are mixing together of codeine

13

this is my understanding, that is causing the

reaction that is basically a gangrene or a rotting

point some crazy person is going to figure out that

You said

12

there is 115 communities that have signed on.

I

13

would like to get a list of those so that if any

14

that are in my District have not signed on, I would

15

like to contact them to have them sign on.
I was wondering -- have you worked

I am not sure right off the bat as to whether we

MR. MASTERS:

6

CHAIRMAN DALEY:

I have mentioned this to

7

you, and we had this discussion numerous times,

8

about the Homeland Security money being used -- I

9

think you said it is limited.

It is only for

10

terrorism, certain parts.

11

Commissioners have terrorism on their streets.

12

Maybe some of this money could be used to help with

programs, such as violence prevention, and it can

assist with substance abuse.

MR. MASTERS:

But I believe other

While the Homeland Security

our budget that we have recently taken over the

management of the justice assistance grant.

and vulnerabilities.

I interviewed department

2

heads, users, Board members, other elected offices,

3

and vendors to find out the lay of the land

4

regarding County technology.

5

most often from County users was that the County's

6

network was slow, the systems and equipment were

7

old, and our department wasn't very responsive.

The comments heard

8

Other elected offices told me that

9

they didn't trust the Bureau, and didn't want to

10

partner with us on any technology projects.

Vendors

11

thought our IT requirements in our procurements were

12

unclear and hard to respond to.

13

discussions with Commissioners, I heard again and

14

again the statement, "We spend and authorize gobs of

15

money for technology, but nothing seems to get any

16

better.

17

can't see where our money is going."

And, from

Our technology never seems to improve and I

Here are some of the things we have

tackled in 2013 to try to address those concerns I

heard when I first came on board:
We have invested a great deal in our

8

Internet network.

Now I compare this to investing

9

in the plumbing and electrical work that goes into

10

your house.

It is not cheap, and you can't see it,

11

so you don't really appreciate it or notice it until

12

it doesn't work and your lights flicker and the

13

toilets back up.
In 2013 we more than doubled the

14
15

capacity of the pipe to the Internet for County

16

employees, and strengthened the core network.

17

one comes up to me and says, "Wow, Lydia.

18

search was lightning fast today -- thanks."

19

expect it to be super fast all the time.

of 2012.

I handed out a one-pager that is just one page of

3

what the catalog looks like, but it is about a

4

forty-page catalog that we developed in the spring.

This is a simple document that lists out all of the

an enormous amount of effort into writing better

that top firms want to work with, if we are going to

Subcommittee.

They were creating a technology bus.

2

It is a better way to structurally share data among

3

all of the offices and all of the public safety

4

offices are committed to that data-sharing strategy,

5

both architecturally and the fact that we need to

6

share data from their core systems in a much better

way.
Much of it, as you know, is on paper

9

today, that we need to get that paper into their

core systems and have the systems talking to one

11

another in a better way.

12

CHAIRMAN DALEY:

That was my concern, that

13

as we move along that there is no lack of

14

cooperation.

15

people are willing to come to the table, but when

16

they get to it, they fall back and they are worried

about their independent offices.

We have heard that before, that the

That is the problem with the elected

officials.

which is good.

How is that working for you?
MS. MURRAY:

With shared services, I think

you have to have competence.

I think offices are

ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 166

1

not going to want to give up control, if they think

2

they are going to get worse service.

3

to do shared services when there is competence.

4

When they think that they are going to get better

5

service, they do not resist.

It is easier

I have been focused on building up

6
7

confidence and competence in my department so it is

8

easier to have a discussion about what is the best

9

value for the County.
We certainly have done that in

10
11

telecomm.

12

mentioned with the Hospital System.

13

know that for disaster recovery and for security it

is shared services that were sort of driving the

15

agenda for both of those areas.

It is shared services for telecomm, as I

COMMISSIONER SIMS:

How are

falling in under one department as opposed to being

COMMISSIONER MURPHY:

My question is a

18

little bit different, in a different category.

19

understand there are three electrician vacancies in

20

your department.

21

You have filled one of those?

22

MS. MURRAY:

23

COMMISSIONER MURPHY:

24

I

I understand you have hired one.

Two started today.
Two started today, so

there is one left?
________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 169

1

MS. MURRAY:

I have three positions that

2

are vacant.

One is a leave of absence.

An employee

3

is in a position that is in a leave of absence.

4

When it looks like in my budget the electrician's

5

positions have gone from nineteen to eighteen, that

6

person on leave of absence is just out.
When he comes back, it will go back up

7
8

to nineteen.

I have two vacancies remaining.

Part

9

of that is we were trying to get some economics of

10

scale when we combined the thirteen electricians in

11

the Health System along with the Bureau of

12

Technology electricians.

13
14
15

Actually six and three -- thirteen -so a total of nineteen.
I am waiting to see if there is some

16

economies of scale before filling both those

17

positions because I think we are doing a good job,

18

having synergy.

19

was for shared services is combining those two to

20

see if we needed to replace all of the vacancies

21

once we pulled the two groups together.

22

COMMISSIONER MURPHY:

I think part of what your vision

It is my

23

understanding that there is a lot of overtime with

24

the electricians.

When you see a lot of overtime,

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 170

1

that means you probably need somebody else in there?
MS. MURRAY:

2

Right.

We hired two people

3

today.

We absolutely want to lower the overtime.

4

want to wait and see how we do with those two

5

electricians.

6

A job that takes twelve hours, that we will never

7

get rid of.

8

structural overtime.

I

Some of the overtime is structural.

So we budget for that each year, some

There was a lot of overtime with the

9
10

RTU, the electricians had to really step up to make

11

sure that they RTU was delivered on time.

12

not necessarily expected and we were down.

13

two electricians that just started today -- I agree

14

there has been overtime.

15

reduced with these two electricians.

16

just a minute and see how it is going before we rush

17

to fill those with the new shared services that you

18

talked about.

20

know?

21

to that?

I want to wait

Would you let me

How soon do you think you will have an answer

MS. MURRAY:

22

These

I think that will be

COMMISSIONER MURPHY:

19

That was

The electricians started

23

today.

Maybe give me a month to wait and see.

We

24

want to make sure they are trained up, and we will
________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 171

1

definitely address that.

If there continues to be

2

overtime, if there continues to be a need, we

3

definitely will fill those positions.
I do anticipate filling at least one

4
5

of them for time and attendance.

6

will be maintaining the clocks, and we know that is

7

additional work.

8

see the schedule of rolling out time and attendance

9

to fill that position.

11

Once the clocks are up I want to

COMMISSIONER MURPHY:

10

These electricians

Do you think just one

will be enough for that?
MS. MURRAY:

12

I think so.

It won't be one

13

person dedicated to all of the clocks, but the

14

workload spread across all the electricians I think

15

will demand filling that position.
COMMISSIONER MURPHY:

16

How soon do you think

that will be?
MS. MURRAY:

Time and attendance is

2

they could go to your department to help structure

or go to?
MS. MURRAY:

Right.

I heard you ask for

5

that.

I am going to be producing a report,

6

COMMISSIONER GORMAN:

for?
MS. MURRAY:

Yes.

I will sit down with HR

need.

of those sheets on your door for all of the money we

I am

7

trying to make sure that the contractors are

the new positions may be?

is all happening?

MS. MURRAY:

That

That is part of what the $40

million investment is that we need to do a much

23

better job of sharing data, both collecting the data

24

that is not on paper, and sharing the data.

So we

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 179

need to make both, in the core systems that do the

transactions as well as taking those core systems

and having them talk to one another.

The second question

-- broadband throughout the County itself.

What is

10

your plan?

11

broadband throughout Cook County, and particularly

12

in those areas that are underserved areas of Cook

County?

14

technology.

15

And what is in the plan for us to have

Those who are not involved in that kind of

MS. MURRAY:

The focus of the Bureau has

16

been to invest in broadband to connect the County

17

buildings first, to make sure Stroger Hospital,

18

Twenty-Sixth and California are on super high-speed

19

connections.

20

As I mentioned, next year we are

21

looking at 2014 at Provident and Oak Forest and

22

Maywood, connecting the courthouse there.

23

In the process of delivering this

24

fiber to our facilities, we are partnering with
________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 185

1

organizations like SSMMA.

They are actually doing

2

the work to get down to Oak Forest and putting in

3

the fiber that we are purchasing.

4

going to be doing the construction work.

They are actually

SSMMA is putting in fiber throughout

5
6

the south suburbs, not only for public institutions,

7

but I believe they have plans to do underserved

8

commercial and residential.
So with our dollars partnering -- the

9
10

biggest cost of broadband fiber is digging up the

11

road.

12

we are paying a portion of it to get down to Oak

13

Forest, it makes it cheaper for them to put in the

14

fiber.

15

the cheapest part of the equation.

16

lower their overall investment costs to then be able

17

to serve the residents and commercials.

If we are sharing the cost on doing that, and

The fiber is the little strands.

That is

It helps them

We don't have plans right now at the

18
19

County for providing those services, but we are

20

looking at where do we partner with groups like

21

SSMMA to lower their costs.

22

Also, we are in talks with Gigabit

We are talking about how do we get

down to the Woodlawn Clinic where we would like to

bring fiber.

We can partner, dig up the road, share

10

the cost of that, and help bring broadband to those

11

neighborhoods there, and to the residents and

12

businesses.

I am interested in Woodlawn Clinic.
So, there are opportunities to do

13
14

that, but we don't have currently plans where we are

15

going to be directly providing to commercials or

16

residential properties.
There are other organizations that are

17

dedicated to that, like SSMMA or Gigabit Squared.

20

is that we have lots of servers and sort of mini
