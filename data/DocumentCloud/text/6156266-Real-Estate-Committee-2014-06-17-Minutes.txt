WHEREAS, in August of 2013, the United States Army Corps of Engineers (“U.S. Army Corps”) issued an
Integrated Feasibility Report and Environmental Assessment for the Upper Des Plaines River and Tributaries of
Illinois and Wisconsin (the “Report”);

 WHEREAS, the Report sought to create a comprehensive plan for addressing flooding and stormwater along the
Des Plaines River; and
WHEREAS, the Report proposed a variety of remediation measures along the Des Plaines river, including the
creation of a reservoir within the Aptakisic Creek watershed, in Lake County, Illinois, near the Village of Buffalo
Grove; and
WHEREAS, in October, 2013, the Village of Buffalo Grove passed a resolution opposing the siting of the
reservoir at Aptakisic Creek; and

and Environmental Assessment” (the “Documentation of Changes”) in response to the Village of Buffalo Grove’s
resolution;

watershed and proposed the creation of two reservoirs at Fullerton Woods and the Harry Semrow Driving Range
within the Forest Preserve District of Cook County; and
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of the Forest Preserve District of Cook County were never presented
with and have not ruled upon the proposal within the Documentation of Changes;
WHEREAS, the proposed creation of the reservoirs is not supported as a land use under law and is against the
mission and land use policies of the Forest Preserve District of Cook County; and

Cook County Board of Commissioners convene a public hearing to discuss the proposed creation of reservoirs at
Fullerton Woods and the Harry Semrow Driving Range; and

PROPOSED LICENSE REQUEST
Request: Requesting authorization for the Forest Preserve District of Cook County (the “Preserves”), as
Licensor to grant a License to the Village of Winnetka, Illinois, Grantee, to locate, operate and maintain 9-foot
by 5-foot concrete box culvert under Tower Road to the Tower Road Lagoon (south of Tower Road, east of

severely restricts flow going into the pond. The installation will allow fuller utilization of the design capacity of
the existing lagoon. As part of this project, the Village will stabilize the lagoon banks with 3:1 slopes, emergent
plants and wet prairie plants, and restore the encroachment area with low profile grasses. A few low value trees
impacted by this project will be replaced with new trees within the restoration area. The Village will manage the
restoration area for 5 years to establish the new plantings. No increase in size or other changes to the lagoon are
proposed.
