LEGISLATIVE POLICY DIVISION
7.
Submitting report relative to Income Tax Reporting Regarding Non-Detroit Residents
Earning Income in the City. (President Pro Tem Sheffield directed the Legislative
Policy Division (LPD) to consult with the Office of the Chief Financial Officer
(OCFO) and draft an ordinance that mandates periodic reporting to the City by
employers of non-Detroit residents who earn income in the City, which is therefore
taxable by the City at the rate of 1.2%. Due to the City’s well-documented fiscal
challenges, the importance of collecting every single potential revenue dollar cannot
be overstated. And because state laws limited mandatory withholding and other
factors, it has been widely alleged that many nonresident workers who actually earn
income by work performed in the City may nevertheless not be paying local income
tax on those earnings. Therefore this is a problem that cries out for solutions to
benefit the City and our residents.) (REFERRED TO THE BUDGET, FINANCE
AND AUDIT STANDING COMMITTEE ON 3-6-19)
