PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT
AN ORDINANCE AMENDING MASTER BOND ORDINANCE NUMBER 11-O-69 ADOPTED
ON THE 27TH DAY OF JULY, 2011, AS PREVIOUSLY AMENDED, TO AUTHORIZE THE
COUNTY TO ENTER INTO A REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT TO FINANCE CAPITAL
PROJECTS AND APPROVING A FORM OF INDENTURE FOR SUCH FINANCING
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners (the “Board”) of The County of Cook, Illinois (the “County”),
heretofore adopted on the 27th day of July, 2011, Ordinance Number 11-O-69 entitled, “An Ordinance
providing for the issuance of one or more series of General Obligation Bonds of The County of
Cook,
Illinois” (the “Bond Ordinance”); and
WHEREAS, the Board amended the Bond Ordinance on the 7th day of September, 2011, pursuant to
amending Ordinance Number 11-O-70 (the “First Amending Ordinance”) entitled, “An Ordinance
Amending Ordinance Number 11-O-69 adopted on the 27th day of July, 2011, by the Board of
Commissioners of The County of Cook, Illinois”; and
WHEREAS, the Board further amended the Bond Ordinance on the 1st day of May, 2012, pursuant to
amending Ordinance Number 12-O-21 (the “Second Amending Ordinance”) entitled, “An Ordinance
Amending Ordinance Number 11-O-69 adopted on the 27th day of July, 2011, as previously amended, to
make technical clarifications and revisions regarding credit facilities and other variable rate debt
instruments”; and
WHEREAS, the Board further amended the Bond Ordinance on the 16th day of October, 2012, pursuant
to amending Ordinance Number 12-O-45 (the “Third Amending Ordinance”) entitled, “An Ordinance
Amending Ordinance Number 11-O-69 adopted on the 27th day of July, 2011, as previously amended, by
the Board of Commissioners of The County of Cook, Illinois”, and
WHEREAS, the Board further amended the Bond Ordinance on the 13th day of November, 2013,
pursuant to amending Ordinance Number 13-1961 (the “Fourth Amending Ordinance”) entitled, “An
Ordinance amending Master Bond Ordinance Number 10-O-69 adopted on the 27th day of July, 2011, as
previously amended, to name additional financing teams and authorize the issuance of certain refunding
bonds” (the Bond Ordinance, as amended by the First Amending Ordinance, the Second Amending
Ordinance, the Third Amending Ordinance and the Fourth Amending Ordinance, being the “Master
Bond Ordinance”); and
WHEREAS, the Master Bond Ordinance authorizes the issuance of one or more series of general
obligation bonds to finance Capital Projects (the “Capital Project Bonds”) in a not to exceed aggregate
principal amount of $295,000,000, for such Capital Projects as are expressly approved by the Board; and
Page 88 of 102

 WHEREAS, traditionally the County has financed its Capital Projects primarily through long-term
borrowing; and
WHEREAS, the County has determined that tax-exempt, revolving lines of credit (each, a “Revolver”)
issued by a bank or banks will provide a cost efficient means to finance its Capital Projects on
tax-exempt basis and that such Revolvers are expected to ultimately be refinanced with tax-exempt
long-term bonds; and
WHEREAS, under the Master Bond Ordinance, any amounts drawn under a Revolver (“Advances”) are
Variable Rate Bonds and are Direct Purchase Bonds purchased by the bank providing such Revolver; and
WHEREAS, the County has determined that a Revolver will assist the County in achieving its goals of
eliminating negative arbitrage in project funds, minimizing costs associated with undrawn balances,
achieving the lowest rate available in the current short-term market and mitigating structural, credit,
liquidity and operational risk; and
WHEREAS, in order to achieve the County’s aforementioned goals, it may be necessary and desirable
for the County to issue additional Variable Rate Bonds by entering into an agreement or agreements with a
bank or banks (each a “Revolver Bank”) to provide a Revolver or Revolvers to the County; and
WHEREAS, in order to clarify that Advances are Variable Rate Bonds and Direct Purchase Bonds under
the Master Bond Ordinance which may be directly purchased by a Revolver Bank and that such Advances
are also Capital Project Bonds under the Master Bond Ordinance, the Board has heretofore and it hereby
expressly is determined that it is advisable and necessary to amend the Master Bond Ordinance, for the
purposes stated herein; and
WHEREAS, the County has determined to enter into an agreement with PNC Bank, National Association
(“PNC”) pursuant to which PNC will provide a Revolver to the County (the “PNC Revolver”); and
WHEREAS, any Advances drawn pursuant to the PNC Revolver will be secured by a Trust Indenture by
and between the County and a trustee to be selected by the County, securing $125,000,000 General
Obligation Bonds, Series 2014B (the “2014B Indenture”) in accord with such financial policies as are
approved by the Board and contained within the annual budget resolution; and
WHEREAS, the Board has heretofore and it hereby expressly is determined that it is advisable and
necessary to (a) enter into the 2014B Indenture, the form of which has been prepared and is present at
this meeting and (b) to enter into an agreement with PNC and execute any related documents
(collectively, the “PNC Revolver Agreement”) in forms approved by the Chief Financial Officer of the
County (the “Chief Financial Officer”) pursuant to which PNC will provide the PNC Revolver to the
County.
