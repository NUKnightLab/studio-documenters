NOTICE OF PUBLIC HEARING
A public hearing will be held by the City Planning Commission in the Committee of the
Whole Room, 13th floor of the Coleman A. Young Municipal Center, 2 Woodward Avenue,
Detroit, Michigan 48226 on
THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 5, 2019 AT 6:00 PM
to consider a text amendment that would amend Chapter 61 of the 1984 Detroit City Code,
Zoning, by amending Article XIV, Development Standards, Division 1, Off-Street Parking,
Loading and Access, Subdivision B, Off-Street Parking Schedule “A”, Sec. 61-14-53 of the
1984 Detroit City Code.
The proposed Zoning text amendment would authorize the Planning and Development
Department to determine the most appropriate off-street parking requirement for manufacturing
and production uses—whether one space per 800 square feet would be required or one space per
3 employees would be required. Currently, manufacturing and production uses are required to
provide the greater of those two specified calculations.
This text amendment is being considered by the City Planning Commission in accordance
with the provisions of Article III, Division 2 of the Detroit Zoning Ordinance. Zoning Ordinance
text amendments require the approval of the City Council after a public hearing and after receipt
of a report and recommendation by the City Planning Commission. You may present your views
on this proposal by attending this hearing, by authorizing others to represent you, or by writing to
this office prior to the hearing, 2 Woodward Avenue, Room 208, Detroit, Michigan 48226
(FAX: 313-224-4336).
Because it is possible that some who are affected by this proposal may not have been
notified, it is suggested that you kindly inform your neighbors so that they too may express their
positions if they so desire.
With advance notice of seven calendar days, the City of Detroit will provide interpreter
services at public meetings, including language translation and reasonable ADA accommodations.
Please contact the Civil Rights, Inclusion and Opportunity Department at (313) 224-4950,
through the TTY number 711, or email crio@detroitmi.gov to schedule these services.”
