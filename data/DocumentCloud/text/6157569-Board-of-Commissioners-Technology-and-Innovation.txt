Summary: In collaboration with the Cook County Offices of the Assessor, Clerk, Treasurer, Board of Review,
and Recorder of Deeds, the Bureau of Technology seeks Board approval of a contract with Tyler Technologies,
Inc. to replace the County’s legacy property tax system. The County currently employs 40-year-old technology
to manage and implement tax collection across 1,500 taxing districts. The system incurs more than $5M per
year in support costs and depends upon inflexible and disparate legacy systems, including paper-based validation
of system reports. These costs are expected to increase as the IT industry and future generations of IT
professionals abandon the legacy technology upon which the County’s property tax domain currently depends.
The proposed contract will re-engineer business processes and workflows through the implementation of modern
technology and provide myriad benefits, including increased property tax revenue from improved assessment,
appraisal, and collection operations, an improved ability to accommodate property tax workloads without requiring
additional staff, and enhanced public services and responsiveness for County tax payers.
Request for Proposals (RFP) procedures were followed in accordance with the Cook County Procurement Code.
Tyler Technologies, Inc. was recommended based on established evaluation criteria.

Summary: In collaboration with the Cook County Sheriff’s Office, the Bureau of Technology seeks to extend
the term of Contract No. 08-45-256 by 9 months and lower the cost of telephone calls that detainees in County
facilities place to family, friends, and private defense counsel.
The proposed amendment will significantly lower the cost of detainee phone calls by reducing account funding
fees by approximately 43%, lowering the contractual per-minute call rate by approximately 14%, and securing a
competitive flat rate for international calls. The extension will provide the County with service while County
