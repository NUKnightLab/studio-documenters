the PMIP include General Liability, Auto Liability, Workers Compensation, Crime/Fidelity and

The services of insurance brokers have assisted the CHA in consistently securing insurance with
higher limits at competitive rates, thereby significantly lowering exposure to selfinsured/uninsured catastrophic losses. Insurance brokerage services have also provided technical
support in the CHA’s loss control and safety initiatives. Since the Authority’s current contract

a Request for Proposal was advertise in area newspapers. The RFP was also mailed to twenty
insurance brokers. Of the five proposals received three brokers were found to be in the

(Item A6)
In October 2003, the CHA issued an Invitation for Bid soliciting qualified firms who could
supply and deliver Gateway Computers to the CHA. The Authority also directly solicited 74
vendors, including 30 MBE and 6 WBE. Of the six proposals received and opened, Interface
Computer Communications proposed the lowest total prices for Dell computers. Since
considerable effort and financial resources have been expended in standardizing computers and
application software, choosing an alternate vendor, such as Dell, would require significant
additional financing to develop and test a new image for an alternate computer. The next lowest
bids were submitted by two vendors. However, one vendor was unable to comply with CHA’s
MBE/WBE requirements and was deemed non-responsive. Accordingly, the resolution for Item
A6 approves award of contract to Computerland, the lowest, responsive and responsible bidder.
RESOLUTION NO. 2003-CHA-184
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated November 6,
2003 entitled “Authorization to Enter Into a Contract with Computerland for
Supply and Delivery of Gateway Computers”.
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to enter into a contract with Info Technologies, Inc. d/b/a Computerland

$520,125.00.

(Item A7)
The resolution for Item A7 approves Amendment No. 77 to the Annual Contributions Contract,
C-1150. This amendment moves grant and loan funds between projects that are ready for
closeout and also makes additional funds available for the special security effort at Horner
Homes. A $402,300 “Reallocation Fund” was established by HUD pursuant to an Agreed Court
Order in the Horner Mother’s Guild case. The CHA has recently reached an agreement with the
West Haven Security Working Group to allow the Reallocation Fund to be used as partial
funding for the Horner/West Haven police patrol program.

 (Item B2)
HUD offers incentives to housing authorities that purchase their natural gas supplies at a cost
that is less than what the local utility would charge. CHA’s past experiences with gas prices,
particularly during winter, are such that by committing to purchase a portion of these future gas
needs at current market conditions, future contracts prove a significant financial benefit. In April
2002, pursuant to RFP No. 01082, the Board approved the Wellhead natural gas contract with
Peoples Energy with three one-year options. The Resolution for Item B2 approves extension of
the contract with Peoples Energy since they have agreed to provide natural gas at the same rates
and under the same terms and conditions as provided for in the original contract.
RESOLUTION NO. 2003-CHA-187
WHEREAS, The Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the
memorandum dated October 28, 2003 entitled “Authorization to exercise the first
year option to extend the Wellhead Natural Gas contract with Peoples Energy
Services Corporation (Contract No. 9717)”;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to execute an amendment to Contract No. 9717 with Peoples Energy
Services Corporation to exercise the first year option to extend the term of the

terms and conditions in an amount not-to-exceed $17,000,000.00 for the purpose
of providing natural gas to the CHA.

(Item B3)
In December 2000, the Board approved and Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with the City
of Chicago to have the Chicago Police Department (CPD) provide supplemental policing
services for CHA’s family developments and senior housing. In November 2002, the Board
approved Extension No. 1 to the IGA for FY2003. The IGA expires on December 31, 2003 and
has an additional one-year option for FY2004. The CHA has determined to continue the
supplemental police services for FY2004. In addition, the Horner Resident Council is requesting
supplemental police services as a replacement for third party security services for the period of
October 2003 to December 2004. In June 2003, the CHA terminated the property management
agreements with the Cabrini green Homes and 1230 N. Burling RMC’s. Due to increased gang
and drug related activities at these locations and the transition to a private property manager at
these locations, CPD agreed to provide additional police personnel at these location. The CHA
has determined to continue police services at these locations through April 30, 2004. The
resolution for Item B3, therefore, approves an IGA for supplemental police services for family
developments, senior housing, West Haven, 1230 N. Burling RMC and Cabrini Green RMC.
