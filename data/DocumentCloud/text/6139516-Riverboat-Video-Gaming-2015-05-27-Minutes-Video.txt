On Thursday, May 28, 2015 a Regular Meeting - Video of the Illinois Gaming Board (“Board”)

APPROVAL OF MINUTES – Open Session
Member Gould moved that the Board approve the open session minutes of its Regular
Meeting of April 23, 2015. Member Alejandre seconded the motion. The Board approved the
motion unanimously by roll call vote.
PUBLIC COMMENTARYWilliam Bogot – From the Law Firm Fox Rothschild addressed the Board pertaining to an
application of a Video Gaming Establishment license awaiting licensure. Also addressing the
Board was Michelle Pinski owner of Wash-N-Winnie’s of Momence, Inc.
DISCUSSION OF AMENDMENT TO VIDEO GAMING RULE 330 –
Caleb Melamed – Legislative Liaison for the Illinois Gaming Board addressed the Board.
Section 78 (a) (3) and (b) of the Video Gaming Act grant the Board rulemaking authority.
During the May 28 open meeting of the Illinois Gaming Board, the Board’s legal staff will
submit a proposal to amend the rules on video gaming [11 Ill. Adm. Code 1800] with respect to
economic disassociation.
Video gaming Rule 330, (“Economic Disassociation”) currently authorizes the Board to
order the disassociation from a licensee of a person holding an ownership interest or meeting the
standard for designation as a “Person With Significant Interest or Control” (“PSIC”). “PSIC” is
defined by video gaming Rule 110 (“Definitions”) to include persons who either:
•

Are issued a license in their name;

•

Have ability to influence or control the activities of an applicant or licensee; or

•

Exercise significant influence or control over decisions concerning any part of an
applicant or licensee's video gaming operation.

 Rule 330 does not authorize the Board to direct the disassociation of those persons who lack
an ownership interest and fall short of the threshold for PSIC designation, but whose
involvement in a video gaming operation may be nevertheless sufficient to pose a threat to that
operation’s integrity.
Accordingly, it is proposed to amend Section 330 by authorizing the Board to order the
disassociation of “any person connected with video gaming operations” upon a finding that
economic disassociation is warranted.
