Report from Chief Quality Officer
A. Regulatory and Accreditation Updates
Dr. Krishna Das, Chief Quality Officer, stated that representatives from The Joint Commission arrived on
November 23rd for a follow-up survey to check on the Conditions of Participation (COPs) at Stroger Hospital.
They cleared Stroger Hospital of all of its original citations on COPs, so Stroger Hospital is completely compliant
with Medicare conditions.
Following the meeting, Chairman Gugenheim requested that the following report from Dr. Das on the above
subject be included in the record.
In order to comply with the requirements surrounding the condition-level finding
of The Joint Commission regarding leadership and governance, the
administration wants to make certain that the Quality and Patient Safety
Committee, as well as the entire Board, is aware that staff addressed the
following issues:
1.

Staff replaced faulty equipment and conducted additional testing and
balancing to confirm that appropriate air pressures are maintained.

Report from Chief Quality Officer
A. Regulatory and Accreditation Updates (continued)
2.

Staff conducted risk assessments and daily rounding of construction
projects to properly evaluate all elements of the Infection Control Risk
Assessment (ICRA), Interim Life Safety Measures (ILSM), and noise and
vibration.

3.

Temperature logs and procedures were revised, and staff was trained on the
new logs. The nail hygiene policy was also updated to clarify that it
applies to all personnel providing direct patient care.

4.

Staff training and competency assessments were completed regarding
updated policies and procedures for proper operation of sterilization
equipment.

Compliance with these processes was validated by the follow-up conditions-level
survey, at which all such findings were removed.

B. Metrics (Attachment #1)
Dr. Das provided an overview of the Metrics. Dr. John Jay Shannon, Chief Executive Officer, provided additional
information. The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
During the discussion of the data regarding influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations, Dr. Das noted that this
measure is usually lower over the summer months; because flu season does not occur during the summer, influenza
vaccinations are not administered during that time. Board Chairman Hammock inquired whether the vaccinations
metric can be split into two (2) separate metrics for each type of vaccine. Dr. Das responded that the data is
collected together; she will further review the matter to see how easy it is to separate it.
Dr. Shannon provided an update on the status of influenza vaccination compliance for employees. There was a
deadline of December 1st for compliance with the policy. Staff are working on finalizing the data, but at the last
look, there was 94% compliance by employed staff with the policy; compliance means that the employee has
either received the vaccination or the administration has accepted that employee’s exemption from the vaccination.
With regard to how the administration handles those exempted staff from a safety point of view, Dr. Shannon
stated that the most effective strategy is determined on a case-by-case basis. An unvaccinated person who works
alone in an office may not pose a great risk to patients, but the risks to patients might be very different for an
unvaccinated employee providing direct patient care. In some cases, the strategy may involve reinforcement of
good hygiene; in other cases, it might mean masking.
Director Lerner referenced a recent article regarding physicians who are dismissing from their practice
unvaccinated patients or families that refuse vaccinations for their children. He inquired whether CCHHS or the
medical staff have put forth a policy regarding treating patients who have not been inoculated; he noted that this
question pertains to both CCHHS as a provider and CountyCare as a health insurance plan. Dr. Shannon responded
in the negative; he noted that the administration has not received information from its Ambulatory Services or from
its pediatric hospital-based practice that indicates a culture of resistance to pediatric vaccinations.
Chairman
Gugenheim noted that this may be a phenomenon relating to a different type of population. In response to a

Report from Chief Quality Officer
B. Metrics (continued)
question regarding whether data is available on the number of unvaccinated patients who come into the pediatric
locations, Dr. Das stated that, in Ambulatory Services, there are a couple of ways to get that data. It can be
obtained from the State’s registry on immunizations; staff can look at that for its pediatric patients and assess the
degree of immunization in that population. A lot of CCHHS’ pediatric data is actually corrupted by data resulting
from episodic care; staff are trying to sort through that, using Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set
(HEDIS) measures as a standard. She stated that childhood vaccination in Ambulatory Services is one of the
HEDIS measures that is tracked; she added that there is a requirement for reporting on the effectiveness of
vaccination of children who are in the practice as a part of CountyCare’s quality reporting to the State. Director
Lerner recommended that a discussion of this subject be held as it relates to all aspects of the System – as a health
care provider, health insurance plan and as a public health department; his question is whether CCHHS should be
taking a stand on this subject, as it is a major force in this metropolitan area.
Regarding the measure for Operating Room (OR) efficiency, Dr. Das noted that, because of activities relating to
The Joint Commission survey, staff have gone through a process of re-sterilization and reorganization of all of the
supplies in the OR; that is an ongoing effort, so staff is not as familiar with the locations of items - that has led to
some decrease in efficiencies. Dr. Shannon provided additional information. He stated that there are multiple
parts related to this matter. One part relates to the fact that the Sterile Processing Department is being completely
rebuilt. This is an effort that has been undertaken over the last six (6) months and is expected to be complete
before mid-year 2016; this includes not only resurfacing and repainting everything in the space, but it also includes
installation of new equipment. Another part relates to the significant amount of work going on in the organization
as it relates to temperature and humidity control; this affects the entire hospital, including the OR. Additionally,
management is completely redoing the way supply management is done in the OR; it is believed that this will have
long-lasting benefits, not only relating to efficiency, but also to safety and control of costs. Arete Healthcare
Group is the consulting firm that is assisting with this project. Director Lerner requested that this subject be kept on
the Committee’s “front burner.”
Director Marsh noted that the Committee now has a year’s worth of data that has been presented; referring
specifically to Patient Experience at Stroger Hospital, she stated that the current data is either identical or lower
than what it was a year ago on those four (4) parameters. Dr. Das and her team have been working hard, but these
numbers are not budging or moving in the right direction. She recommended that these four (4) measures should
be broken down, one by one, to have some deeper work done on each of them; she believed that the measure
relating to cleanliness is a good place to start, as it should be the least complicated. It is a matter of 1) do we have
enough people; and 2) are those people doing their jobs for cleanliness? A deeper analysis needs to be done on
patient perception, beyond the questions posed in the Press Ganey survey. She requested that the Committee
receive a report on this subject from operations that provides information and a plan to address this matter,
sometime in the 1st Quarter of 2016.

C. Introduction to Quality Plans (Attachment #2)
Dr. Das reviewed the presentation regarding the Introduction to the Quality Plans.

Report from Chief Quality Officer
C. Introduction to Quality Plans (continued)
With regard to the information contained on slide 4, Director Lerner recommended that CountyCare be included in
the list; he suggested that, from an organizational point of view, there should perhaps be a third category that is
more programmatic, and include the Cook County Department of Public Health and CountyCare in that category.
Ms. Merryweather suggested that data analysis, interpretation and interventions be included as part of the
functions.
During the discussion of the information on slide 8 of the presentation, Chairman Gugenheim inquired regarding
reporting of patient complaint/grievance data. Dr. Das responded that she will follow-up on the question with
Chairman Gugenheim.
Dr. Shannon noted that one of the things that organizations recognize but have a hard time translating to behavior
change is the notion that the Quality Department owns and produces quality for the organization; he predicted that
this will be a very significant, multi-year, uphill challenge for CCHHS. The administration is currently awaiting
the results of the employee survey regarding the culture of safety; however, it is already known that participation in
the survey itself was low - that speaks to a problem in and of itself. There have been discussions in the past
regarding challenges with staff engagement; this is an organization that has not historically used either annual
performance evaluations or intermittent coaching and feedback on a regular basis that shows staff that their leaders
are aware of their performance and that they are trying to develop the employee personally and professionally in
the attainment of their goals. It is very difficult in this System to practice and build in rewards and incentives;
there is very little ability within this structure to be able to reward people individually at the level of their
performance. Dr. Shannon stated that he is jelling together a leadership team that is understanding and aligned in
each of their responsibilities and accountabilities; they are being informed by the Quality Department but know
that execution of corrective actions are not the responsibility of the Quality Department – those are the
responsibility of leadership. This will be a multi-year journey; the fact that improvements have not been seen,
despite the efforts that have been poured into the patient experience initiative, does speak directly to the culture
and the challenges surrounding that. This needs to be confronted and brought down to the staff level, to have them
examine the very human reasons of why they chose to enter the health field. They should be provided with the
resources and support they need to execute their job, but they should also be reminded every day of the immediacy
of their own very specific behaviors and the outcomes - both clinical and experiential - for patients and their
families.
In response to a question regarding the engagement of labor partners in conversations about quality and cultural
transformation, Dr. Shannon stated that they have been engaged, but now that negotiations for collective
bargaining agreements (CBAs) are largely completed and no longer will require so much time, both sides of the
table will be able to have that conversation in a more constructive way. Gladys Lopez, Chief of Human Resources,
stated that most, but not all, of the new CBAs have been signed; they will expire in 2017. Director Lerner
inquired whether the subject of bonuses has been discussed in the past; he wondered if the establishment of a
bonus pool for staff would be feasible under the CBAs.
Director Marsh stated that engagement of physicians, nursing and staff together is critical. People respond and
perform better when they feel included, valued, respected and heard. It is one thing to engage them in a plan that
was developed from the top down, but when they are engaged in a plan where they had a real voice in creating, that
can have decidedly greater impact and success.
