GENERAL BACKGROUND

 

From January 2004 through September 2004, the Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD) conducted an accessibility compliance review of the programs,
services and activities, including designated accessible housing units, associated common areas,
on-site management of?ces, housing programs, and non-housing programs and activities. As a
result of the infractions found during the review, the CHA entered into a Voluntary Compliance
Agreement (VCA) with HUD effective May 1, 2006. The VCA will last for the duration of
seven (7) years over which time the CHA must progressively certify that 5.3% of its units are
accessible for individuals with mobility impairments and 2.1% of its units are accessible for
individuals with sensory impairments.

On December 9, 2009, the Board authorized CHA to enter into a two year base term contract
with LCM pursuant to a competitive procurement. The Contract provides for three stages of
accessibility reviews. The plan/construction drawing review, which is the ?rst stage in the
process, consists of examining plans and drawings submitted by Architects of Record for both
redeveloped and rehabilitated properties for adherence to all applicable accessibility codes and
regulations. The second stage consists of inspections conducted at the pre-drywall phase and
again at the 95%, or near completion of construction in a sampling of accessible units in both
redeveloped and rehabilitated properties. Finally, as mandated by the VCA, the third stage
consists of LCM as an independent third-party to fully verify/certify the accessibility features in
units designated as accessible throughout the Senior and Family portfolios. Under the
VCA, all units designated as Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS)-Accessible must
be inspected and veri?ed/certi?ed by an independent third-party.

Furthermore, LCM has served as the HUD-approved Third-Party Certi?er for the past
?ve years, which includes a previous contract. Under the Contract?s base-term, LCM has
satisfactorily performed the required services. During that time, LCM has assisted the in
accomplishing the certi?cation of its accessible housing in its senior portfolio in time to achieve
the VCA benchmark of December 2010. They have certi?ed nearly 100% of the accessible units
in family housing throughout the Mixed-Income Mixed-Finance, Traditional, and
Scattered Sites portfolios, and they continue to provide professional guidance and inspections for
planned units and units under construction. LCM has an extensive knowledge of accessibility
codes and has years of experience doing work very similar to the scope required by CHA at other
public entities, including other public housing authorities, the Mayor?s Of?ce for People with
Disabilities, and sister agencies, such as Chicago Public Schools and the Chicago Transit
Authority, as well as past work with the CHA.

The Board action recommended in this item complies in all material respects with all applicable
Chicago Housing Authority board policies and all applicable federal (HUD) procurement laws.

The Deputy Chief Legal Officer concurs with the recommendation to exercise the second and
?nal option to extend this Contract.

The CEO/President recommends the approval to exercise the second and ?nal option to extend
this Contract.
