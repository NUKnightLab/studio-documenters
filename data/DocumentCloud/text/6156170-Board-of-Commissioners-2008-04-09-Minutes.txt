justice regardless of whether his position was popular or not; he was a vocal and grounded critic of the
police and the courts and worked doggedly for the political advancement of African Americans; and

election; and

PRESENTATION
The following item was deferred at the March 6, 2008 Board Meeting:
Transmitting a Communication, dated February 25, 2008 from
MIKE QUIGLEY, County Commissioner
this request formally invites the Assessor’s Office to give a presentation highlighting the newest website
features available on the Assessor’s website. We appreciate all of the efforts the Assessor’s office has
made to comply with the amended Cook County Ethics Ordinance. The amendments to the Ethics
Ordinance sought to bring a greater level of transparency to the property tax appeal process, and the
changes made to the Assessor’s website have facilitated this goal of increased transparency. The recent
advancements to the Assessor’s website, making all property tax appeals data available and easily
accessible to the public, demonstrate the office’s willingness to go above and beyond our expectations of
transparency and equality in the tax appeal process.

5550

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 9, 2008
In an effort to share the Assessor’s latest achievement with all Cook County Board members, county
employees, the press, and anyone who might utilize this new feature, we hope they will be available to
present the new website features at a Cook County Board meeting.

WHEREAS, the amount of this tax increase is equal to roughly twice the amount of the actual county
deficit; and
WHEREAS, this tax increase will result in Cook County having a sales tax of more than 10%, which will
result in many residents fleeing to other counties to make purchases; and
WHEREAS, the decision of whether to increase taxes by such a dramatic amount should be made by the
voters of Cook County.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the President and Board of Commissioners of the
County of Cook, Illinois, as follows:

written comments filed with the Cook County Clerk by 45 days before the
election. No summary shall mention names of persons or private groups, nor any
endorsements of or resolutions against the proposal. Petition representatives
following these rules shall write this summary for their petition. The county clerk
officer shall maintain and accurately summarize all other relevant written
comments.

(d)
Except by later voter approval, if a tax increase or fiscal year spending exceeds any
estimate in (b) (iii) for the same fiscal year, the tax increase is thereafter reduced up to 100% in
proportion to the combined dollar excess, and the combined excess revenue refunded in the next fiscal
year. County bonded debt shall not issue on terms that could exceed its share of its maximum repayment
costs in (b) (iv). Ballot titles for tax or bonded debt increases shall begin, “SHALL COOK COUNTY
TAXES BE INCREASED (first, or if phased in, final, full fiscal year dollar increase)
ANNUALLY...?” or “SHALL COOK COUNTY DEBT BE INCREASED (principal amount),

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
RESOLUTION CONCERNING REMOVAL OF THE PUBLIC DEFENDER
WHEREAS, the office of the public defender is an office created by state statute, all as set forth in
Article 3, Division 3-4 of the Counties Code, 55 ILCS 5/1-1001, et seq. (“Illinois Law”); and
WHEREAS, Illinois Law sets forth the purpose of the public defender and the declaration of the General
Assembly of the State of Illinois wherein the General Assembly recognizes the People of the State of
Illinois’ fundamental right to quality legal representation in criminal and related proceedings; and
WHEREAS, Illinois Law also provides the process for appointment, the terms of employment, the oath
of office, the duties, the compensation, a provision for appointment of assistants, provisions for office
quarters and expenses and record keeping of the Public Defender in Cook County; and
WHEREAS, the President of the Cook County Board of Commissioners (the “President”) and the Cook
County Board of Commissioners clearly recognized the intent of the General Assembly to provide quality
legal representation to the indigent by seeking to reduce Edwin A. Burnette’s (hereinafter referred to as
the “Public Defender”) caseload by creating twenty-eight (28) new positions in the 2008 Budget; and

5557

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 9, 2008
WHEREAS, notwithstanding the President’s and the Cook County Board of Commissioner’s willingness
to create twenty-eight (28) new positions to further ensure quality legal representation of the indigent,
during the Public Defender’s tenure, there were thirty-four (34) inmates of Cook County Jail (persons
held in custody who have not been convicted of a crime) who waited for trial for over five (5) years at an
approximate cost to the Cook County taxpayers of $5,584,500 ($90 per day for 34 inmates for 5 years),
while the Public Defender continues to fail to ensure that all assistant public defenders work a full forty
(40) hour work week, (See, Evaluation of the Juvenile Justice Division of the law office of the Cook
County Public Defender submitted herewith as Exhibit A on page 10 and hereinafter referred to as the
“Northwestern Report”); and
WHEREAS, Illinois Law provides the process for removing the Cook County Public Defender and is set
forth below:
The public defender once approved by the Board shall serve for 6 years and may be
removed by the President only for good cause or dereliction of duty after notice and a
hearing before the Board.
55 ILCS 5/3-4004.2(c) (emphasis added); and
WHEREAS, Black’s Law Dictionary defines dereliction in the performance of duties as:
[W]illful or negligent failure to perform assigned duties; culpable inefficiency in performing
assigned duties.
West Group, Black’s Law Dictionary 454 (7th ed. 2001); and
WHEREAS, the President, being the duly elected officer, has determined that there is good cause to
remove the Public Defender; and
WHEREAS, the Public Defender has willfully or negligently failed to perform the following assigned
duties as the Cook County Public Defender in that:
1.

The Public Defender failed to notify the administration of the Chicago Community
Group’s ongoing report concerning the Criminal Courts; and the Public Defender, as
cited in the Northwestern Report, failed to ensure that all employees of his office
performed a full forty (40) hour week of work in exchange for their compensation;
specifically, the Northwestern Report stated there existed a problem in his office
concerning the early departure of assistants after court (See, Exhibit A, page 10);

2.

The Public Defender has failed to timely process promotions of employees within his
office resulting in an unnecessary and unreasonable delay in the hiring of entry-level
employees. The following are examples of such failures:
•

On or about October 25, 2007, the Public Defender was provided with lists of
applicants for the promotional position of public defender III and IV. The Public
Defender has approximately fifteen (15) of these positions vacant. Filling these
positions would allow the Public Defender to create vacancies for public defender I
positions, and hire attorneys to reduce caseloads. As of March 31, 2008, the Public
Defender has failed to fill all such positions except three (3).

5558

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 9, 2008
•

In or about July, 2007, the Public Defender requested that five (5) public defender I
positions be reclassified to clerical positions within his office, further reducing his
ability to hire attorneys to reduce caseloads. This request was processed on or about
July 17, 2007.

•

Beginning on or about November 29, 2007, the Public Defender was advised that
supervisory positions could not be posted until job descriptions for those positions
were completed by his office and reviewed by the Bureau of Human Resources.
Despite repeated communications, these descriptions were not completed until midMarch, 2008. At about that same time, the Public Defender requested that these
positions not be posted, thereby placing the entire process in indefinite limbo.

Such failures have led this Public Defender to have a caseload greater than the national
standard. (See, Exhibit B submitted herewith the American Council of Chief Defenders
Statement on Caseloads and Workloads, August 24, 2007); and
3.

The Public Defender failed to ensure that all non-union employees complied with the
President’s executive order concerning the five (5) furlough day mandate, which
contributed to additional financial burden to Cook County and such savings should have
been reprogrammed back into services to the poor; and

4.

The Public Defender did not adequately handle the disciplinary issue of an employee
under his supervision who is alleged to have committed a crime in the workplace and
alleged to have been in possession of illegal and illicit drugs in the workplace; (See,
Exhibit C submitted herewith Pot Delivered to Public Defender’s Office Gets Clerk,
November 28, 2007); and

5.

The Public Defender has failed to identify Shakman Exempt positions as required under
the provisions of the Supplemental Relief Order and Consent Decree established in the 69
C 2145 and titled Shakman, et al v. The Democratic Organization, et al.; and

6.

The Public Defender misled the Cook County Board of Commissioners by seeking the
appointment of a Special State’s Attorney to provide “analysis, interpretation and advice”
(See, Exhibit D submitted herewith Petition for Appointment of a Special State’s
Attorney) and the Public Defender exceeded such authority granted to him by this Board
of Commissioners by suing the President thereby causing a potential financial liability to
the Cook County taxpayers to pay attorney fees to the Public Defender’s attorney and the
President’s attorney. (See, Exhibit E submitted herewith Public Defender’s Complaint
and See also, Exhibit F submitted herewith Motion to Dismiss Pursuant to Section 2619); and

WHEREAS, the President, after affording the Public Defender the right to a hearing before the Cook
County Board of Commissioners, should remove the Public Defender as the Public Defender of Cook
County if there exists good cause for such removal.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that the
above stated recitals and whereas clauses are incorporated herein by reference; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that this Board of
Commissioners hereby finds that a hearing occurred to discuss whether the Public Defender was in fact
derelict in his duty and whether there is good cause for removal; and
5559

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 9, 2008
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that this Board of
Commissioners hereby supports the President’s removal of the Public Defender as the Public Defender of
Cook County in accordance with 55 ILCS 5/3-4004.2(c) for reasons set forth in this Resolution and at his
hearing before the President and this Board of Commissioners and further finds that his removal and the
appointment of another individual will best provide an environment where the taxpayers of Cook County
have greater confidence that resources allotted to the Cook County Public Defender are administered so
as to best fulfill his statutory duty to provide quality legal representation to the indigent of Cook County.

WHEREAS, on April 2, 2008, SSM Health Care (SSM), one of the nation’s largest Catholic health care
systems, will close St. Francis Hospital & Health Center, situated on 14 acres at Western Avenue and
127th Street, after 103 years of serving the Blue Island community; and
WHEREAS, St. Francis is a non-profit, 410-bed acute-care hospital providing primary, secondary and
tertiary levels of care and offers a comprehensive range of medical, surgical, pediatric and obstetrical care
and services as well as cutting edge prevention and treatment of heart disease; and
WHEREAS, over the last seven years, SSM invested more than $75 million to modernize St. Francis into
a competitive, state-of-the-art facility that included an expanded emergency department, comprehensive
imaging and diagnostic services, outpatient surgery services, a women’s wellness center, a newly
dedicated endoscopy unit, and an award-winning cardiovascular center; and
WHEREAS, despite this investment, the hospital lost $40 million since 2002 and was projected to lose
$20 million in 2008 alone; and
WHEREAS, fifty percent of the people who come to St. Francis’ Emergency Department and twenty five
percent of the people who are admitted to the hospital either have no health insurance or are covered by
Medicaid; and
WHEREAS, state and federal reimbursements for Medicare and Medicaid have significantly slowed,
including $1.8 billion in unpaid Medicaid bills awaiting processing from the state; and
WHEREAS, the increase of uninsured and underinsured patients, sagging Medicare and Medicaid
reimbursements, as well as huge demands for capital needs at SSM’s other hospitals, have led to SSM’s
decision to close the doors of St. Francis Hospital in the next several months; and
WHEREAS, after exhausting efforts to find a buyer for the hospital, SSM has offered to give the hospital
away for free and has reached out to Chicago and national faith-based providers and other health
facilities.

5560

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 9, 2008
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Bureau of Health Services conduct a
feasibility analysis to explore the possibility of whether or not the acquisition of St. Francis Hospital at no
cost is a viable option for strengthening the Bureau’s ability to serve the uninsured and underinsured
population of Cook County and for increasing the Bureau’s revenue stream of Medicare and Medicaid
reimbursement.

RESOLUTION OF THE COOK COUNTY BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS IN SUPPORT OF
THE APPLICATION FOR PURCHASE OF THE ELGIN, JOLIET AND EASTERN RAILWAY
BY THE CANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAY PENDING BEFORE THE UNITED STATES
DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION TO ENHANCE REGIONAL TRAIN SYSTEMS
WHEREAS, one third of the nation’s freight rail traffic moves to, from or through the Chicago area
every year making it the transportation hub of North America; and
WHEREAS, rail congestion has significantly slowed freight traffic through the Chicago region to the
point where it can now take a freight train 24 hours to travel the thirty miles through the City of Chicago,
slowing rail transportation nationwide; and
WHEREAS, opening up capacity on urban rail lines means that all rail traffic will move more efficiently
and smoothly through the city; and
WHEREAS, freight trains are three times more fuel-efficient and emit one-third less pollution than
trucks carrying comparable loads, thereby lessening the drain on the nation’s energy reserves; and
WHEREAS, a typical freight train carries the equivalent of 280 truck-trailer loads, thereby alleviating
highway congestion by keeping time-sensitive freight on the rails rather than diverting to highways; and
WHEREAS, rail transportation is crucial to the region economically touching five million jobs
nationwide; and

5562

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 9, 2008
WHEREAS, if the problem of rail congestion in the region goes unchecked, it could cost the region $2
billion in production with impacts on 17,000 jobs over the next two decades; and
WHEREAS, the Chicago Region Environmental and Transportation Efficiency Program (CREATE) a
model public-private partnership, initiated more than five years ago, developed a comprehensive long
term plan that would revitalize the area’s transportation network by reconfiguring rail traffic through the
Chicago Metropolitan region; and
WHEREAS, the CREATE comprehensive plan still hasn’t received full government funding, even
though it has had wide support from every level of government, the private sector and a broad crosssection of non-governmental groups and organizations; and
WHEREAS, the Canadian National Railway Company, a founder and strong proponent of CREATE
since its inception, has proposed rerouting its traffic from the congested urban rail lines to the underutilized Elgin, Joliet and Eastern Railway at its own cost and expense, thereby opening up new capacity
on those urban lines; and
WHEREAS, by rerouting its traffic, the Canadian National Railway Company will relieve freight
congestion on many of Chicago’s regional rail lines, thereby reducing travel times, pollution from idling
trains and costs resulting from shipping delays.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and Cook County Board of
Commissioners urges the Surface Transportation Board of the U.S. Department of Transportation to
approve the application of the Canadian National Railway Company to acquire the Elgin, Joliet and
Eastern Railway as a valuable enhancement of the region’s rail network; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a copy of this Resolution be forwarded to the acting secretary of

This convening of the designated representatives of each of the organizations which comprise the
Nominating Committee was pursuant to Cook County Ordinance 08-O-22, approved and adopted on
February 29, 2008, which states:

5649

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 9, 2008
Sec. 38.2.a. Members of the IBOD shall be selected by the following process.
Sec 38-2.a(i). A Nominating Committee shall be convened no later than 14 days

participate as its representative: the Civic Federation of Chicago, the Civic
Committee of the Commercial Club of Chicago, the Chicago Urban League, the
Healthcare Financial Management Association, the Suburban Primary Health Care
Council, the Illinois Public Health Association, the Metropolitan Chicago
Healthcare Council, the Health and Medicine Policy Research Group, the Chicago
Department of Public Health, the Cook County Physicians Association, the Chicago

Community Safety Net Hospitals, and the Midwest Latino Health Research Center.
The Nominating Committee shall elect its chair from its own ranks. All decisions
shall be by majority vote. The Nominating Committee shall recommend twenty (20)
candidates for nomination and shall transmit their names and qualifications to the
President of the Cook County Board within 30 days of the Nominating Committee’s
convening.
President Todd H. Stroger presided over the opening of the meeting and requested that a roll call of the
members of the Nominating Committee be taken by Matthew B. DeLeon, Secretary to the Board of
Commissioners of Cook County.
A quorum was established. President Stroger welcomed the representatives and gave a brief statement on
recent achievements and future hopes for the Bureau of Health Services.
Richard Velázquez, Special Counsel to President Todd H. Stroger, provided the Nominating Committee
members with an overview of Cook County Ordinance 08-O-22.
President Stroger opened the floor for nominations for Chairman of the Nominating Committee.
A motion was made by Dr. Lubin-Johnson, seconded by Dr. Giachello, to nominate Mr. Richard
Sewell as Chairman of the Nominating Committee.
A motion was made by Mr. Werner, seconded by Mr. Msall, to nominate Dr. Larry Goodman as
Chairman of the Nominating Committee.
Following discussion, both nominating motions were withdrawn by their respective sponsors.
A motion was made by Dr. Mason, seconded by Mr. Balanoff, to nominate Mr. Richard Sewell as
Chairman and Dr. Larry Goodman as Vice Chairman of the Nominating Committee. The motion
carried unanimously.
Chairman Sewell in the Chair.
A motion was made by Dr. Mason, seconded by Ms. Schaps, to nominate Dr. Aida Giachello as
Secretary of the Nominating Committee. The motion carried unanimously.
Discussion followed on how best to proceed in order to accomplish the directives stated in the Ordinance.

5650

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 9, 2008
A motion was made by Dr. Mason, seconded by Secretary Giachello, that among the twenty names
submitted to the President, at least one person should be nominated for the Governing Board per
area of qualification categories listed in Section 38.2.b. of the Ordinance, and a recommendation
should be made to the President that his selection be representative of persons for each of these
areas.
Dr. Lubin-Johnson moved to amend the motion, to combine the areas of qualification categories
“Health Care Management” and “Clinical Medicine” referenced in Section 38.2.b. of the Ordinance
into one area of qualification category. The motion to amend died due to lack of a second.
Mr. Msall moved to amend the motion, to recognize the primary area of expertise as experience in
the governance of a large and complex health care system. The motion to amend died due to lack of
a second.
Ms. Jones, seconded by Mr. Balanoff, moved to table the motion. The motion carried. Dr. Mason
voted no.
A discussion began regarding potential conflict of interest matters. Ms. Schaps inquired whether
employees of Cook County or those serving on the Nominating Committee could be nominated to the
Interim Board of Directors.
Mr. Velázquez replied that he believed that those serving on the Nominating Committee could be
nominated, but employees of Cook County could not be nominated.
Mr. Msall inquired whether the nominations would be subject to any restrictions beyond conflict of
interest issues.
Mr. Velázquez replied that Cook County has a residency requirement for their employees, however this
ordinance is silent with regard to a residency requirement.
Dr. Mason noted that communications between Nominating Committee members may be subject to the
Open Meetings Act. He asked for further clarification on the matter.
Mr. Velázquez advised the members that their deliberations were subject to the Open Meetings Act,
which ensures that public business is discussed in a public forum. Communications between more than
four members of the Committee without prior notice to the public in the form of a meeting notice would
be prohibited under the Act.
Mr. Balanoff inquired whether members could submit proposed candidates for nomination to the
Chairman electronically without being subject to the Open Meetings Act.
Mr. Velázquez replied affirmatively. He stated that the submissions could be made to the Chairman
electronically; however an electronic communication that invites discussion and deliberation would be
subject to the Act and should be transmitted to no more than four members.
Secretary Giachello indicated that it would be optimal to receive the biographies and resumes of the
proposed candidates prior to deliberations.
Chairman Sewell suggested that members send proposed nominees and background information to him;
when a meeting notice is sent, the members will receive the background information on the proposed
candidates as backup information.

5651

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 9, 2008
Dr. Lubin-Johnson, seconded by Ms. Bigelow, moved that committee members be limited to six
proposed candidates for the first round of deliberations. The motion carried unanimously.
Dr. Mason clarified the procedures agreed upon by the committee members for deliberations. The
committee members would submit proposed candidates to the Chairman. A matrix would be developed
for members for the next meeting, which would identify the area of qualifications the proposed candidate
falls within. However, members are not precluded from proposing candidates who do not fall within the
areas of qualifications as listed in Section 38.2.b. of the Ordinance.
Mr. Msall inquired whether the committee could consider the proposed candidates in executive session.
Mr. Velázquez relied in the affirmative. He cited the specific exception allowed under the Open Meetings
Act that allows deliberation of these matters in closed session.
Mr. Msall, seconded by Dr. Lubin-Johnson, moved that the committee meet in executive session to
present and discuss the proposed candidates at their next meeting. The motion carried
unanimously.
Dr. Lubin-Johnson, seconded by Ms. Jones, moved to set the submission deadline for the first
round of proposed candidates to be sent to the Chairman for Monday, March 31, 2008 at 5:00 p.m.
The motion carried. Ms. Schaps voted no.
Mr. Balanoff, seconded by Mr. Msall, moved to adopt Robert’s Rules of Order, latest edition. The
motion carried unanimously.
Mr. Balanoff, seconded by Dr. Lubin-Johnson, moved to suspend the portion of Robert’s Rules to
allow use of substitute individuals to represent organizations. The motion carried unanimously.
Dr. Lubin-Johnson, seconded by Ms. Jones, moved to set the submission deadline for the first
round of proposed candidates to be sent to the Chairman for Friday, March 28, 2008.
Mr. Balanoff, seconded by Mr. Msall, moved to amend the motion to change the submission
deadline for the first round of proposed candidates to be sent to the Chairman for Monday, March
31, 2008 in order that they be presented to the committee for a meeting to be held on Friday, April
4, 2008 at 1:00 p.m. The motion carried unanimously.

Adjusted amount:
Reason:

$44,280.00

equipment.
Savings from the elimination of this service will be applied toward an expansion of the
planned County Board Webcasting Project. This project will result in live webcasts of County
Board Meetings, as well as archived audio and video of previous meetings available through
the Secretary to the Board website. The expiration date of the current contract was February
29, 2008.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $22,290.00. Contract extension: March 1, 2008 through May 31, 2008. (018224 Account).

BUREAU OF ADMINISTRATION
AUTHORIZATION TO RESCIND A PREVIOUSLY APPROVED CONTRACT
AND AUTHORIZATION TO ENTER INTO A NEW CONTRACT
Transmitting a Communication, dated March 26, 2008 from
MARK KILGALLON, Chief Administrative Officer, Bureau of Administration
requesting authorization to enter into a professional services contract with Integrys Energy Services,
Chicago, Illinois, for the purchase and delivery of natural gas for the County’s heating and cooling needs.
On February 6, 2008, the Board approved entering into a contract with Enbridge Gas Services (U.S.) Inc.,
however, negotiations conducted by the State’s Attorney’s Office with Enbridge were unsuccessful and
did not result in an agreement on contract terms.
Further requesting that Item #54 from the February 6, 2008 Board Agenda authorizing the Purchasing
Agent to enter into an agreement with Enbridge Gas Services (U.S.), Inc., Appleton, Wisconsin, be
rescinded.
To participate in the deregulated natural gas market, Integrys Energy Services will act as the exclusive
agent for all matters related to the procurement and delivery of natural gas and execute all documents as
may be necessary to carry out and comply with the provisions of the Illinois Commerce Commission’s
conditions of service for public utilities serving Cook County for customer owned gas.
On July 31, 2007, the Board of Commissioners authorized the Bureau of Administration to solicit
proposals through a Request for Proposals (RFP) process for the procurement and delivery of natural gas.
Request for Proposals were issued resulting in the submission of six responses. Evaluation of the
proposals was based upon the (1) margin cost per therm above the index cost of natural gas, (2) firm’s
experience, (3) firm’s financial stability and credit rating, and (4) firm’s ability to meet the MBE/WBE
requirements of the County.
Integrys Energy Services is the County’s current natural gas supplier with a proven track record and was
the second lowest cost proposal. Integrys proposes a margin cost of $0.0020 per therm of natural gas
above the index cost. Margin cost accounts for less than 0.3% of the County’s total gas costs. The
County currently uses an average of 13.7 million therms per year resulting in an estimated annual cost of
$27,484.00 for Integrys’ professional administrative services. The County’s estimated FY 2008 natural
gas costs are $15.9 million.
With approval of the service agreement herein, respectfully request that the Chief Administrative Officer,
or his designee, be authorized to execute, on behalf of the County of Cook, all documents necessary to
implement and administer the service agreement.
All natural gas costs will be charged against the annual appropriation for the utility gas funds for each
using department. (499-422, 500-422, 564-422, 891-422, 894-422, 897-422 and 898-422 Accounts).
Contract Period: May 1, 2008 through April 30, 2012. Requisition No. 84900010.
Approval of this item would commit Fiscal Year 2008 and future year funds.

DEPARTMENT OF BUDGET AND MANAGEMENT SERVICES
REPORT
Transmitting a Communication, dated March 27, 2008 from
JARESE A. WILSON, Director, Department of Budget and Management Services
Subject: 1st Quarter Performance Report
submitting herewith a copy of the 1st Quarter Performance Reporting that highlights performance data
associated with Cook County Departments Services, Activities and Programs. This report is a starting
point when used in budgeting, long-term planning and goal setting, meaningful performance measures
will assist County Officials and Citizens in identifying future decisions regarding resources allocation and
service delivery. The 1st Quarter report will continue to be developed for subsequent quarters of FY 2008
to provide the means to share data on a range of programs, benchmark the County’s performance to
comparable jurisdictions, and improve service delivery through the application of best management
practices and efficient use of resources.
In the 1st Quarter Performance Report, we would like to highlight a Cook County Department that has
shown an especially useful performance measure and recognize their efforts. The Adult Probation
Department performance measure of “percentage of active standard probation cases being supervised
under Evidence Based Practices (EBP) - related procedures” should be acknowledged. The Adult
Probation Department is well above their target that indicates that community corrections programs that
are implemented have a direct impact and may lower offender risk and reduces recidivism.

A Request for Proposals (RFP) for special events was issued by the Purchasing Agent on February 14,

Authorization is hereby requested to execute a ground lease with Plaza Azteca, Inc. on the terms set forth
below. This lease will allow Plaza Azteca, Inc. to stage events during the 2008 summer season, while
working with the Office of the President, the Bureau of Capital, Planning and Facilities Management to

improvements would be constructed by the Tenant prior to the 2009 summer season. Details are:

its events or improvements.
