 PERMIT REVIEW COMMITTEE REPORT TO
COMMISSION ON CHICAGO LANDMARKS
March 5, 2009
The Permit Review Committee (PRC) met on February 5th, at 1:45 p.m. The meeting was held at 33
N. LaSalle Street, Room 1600.
Present:

Ben Weese
John Baird
Phyllis Ellin
Ed Torrez
Ernest Wong

Staff:

Brian Goeken, Deputy Commissioner, Landmarks Division, Department of Zoning and
Land Use Planning
Dijana Cuvalo
Beth Johnson
Cindy Roubik
Lawrence Shure

The following projects were reviewed by the PRC:
1.

350 E. Cermak
(R.R. Donnelley and Sons Co. Calumet Plant – 2nd Ward)
Proposal:

Action:

Proposed 17-foot –tall roof-top sound barrier walls at 8th and 9th floor levels to
control noise from roof-top mechanical equipment
Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1.
The proposed 17’-tall sound barrier around existing and proposed
future mechanical units shown on the roof plan, dated 01/12/09, is
approved. The height of the 8th -floor rooftop sound barrier shall
not exceed 12’-6” above the existing masonry parapet, and the 9th floor rooftop sound barrier shall not exceed 17’-0” above the top of
9th -floor parapet;
2.
Design treatment ‘Option A’ (i.e., vertical piers extending above
the top of the sound barrier), with the wall area a light-beige color
matching the color of the building’s limestone and the metalpaneled piers in a slightly darker beige color, is approved. As
proposed, the paint for the sound barrier wall and metal paneled
piers shall be custom-colored factory-applied baked enamel. Prior
to order and installation, samples shall be reviewed and approved
by Landmarks staff;
3.
As proposed, no mechanical or roof-top equipment visible from the
public-way are to be located above the 8th floor historic interior
spaces, as outlined (“historical area”) in roof plan, dated 01/12/09;
4.
As part of future permit applications for any additional equipment
on the rooftop of the 9th floor, the location of the equipment should
be grouped at the north end as possible to minimize the extent of
sound barrier necessary. The Phase II sound barrier wall shall
match approved specifications, color, finish, and details of the
sound barrier wall approved for the Phase I 9th -floor rooftop; and,

 5.

Should a future alternate source of heating and cooling be found
for the building that would allow the removal of a number of the
rooftop mechanical units, the sound barrier in that location (or
locations) shall be dismantled or reconfigured as part of the permit
application.
