PROPOSED RESOLUTION
Urging the IL General Assembly to Amend Ethics Act
WHEREAS, the Illinois General Assembly recently passed P.A. 098-0457 which amends the State Officials and
Employees Ethics Act; and
WHEREAS, the amendment adds members of a governmental entity appointed by a president or chairperson of
a county board; and
WHEREAS, the amendment left out the appointment of members to a governmental entity by members of a
county board effectively excluding some members appointed by board members only; and
WHEREAS, this omission of members appointed exclusively by board members was not the intention of the
sponsor; and
WHEREAS, after speaking to the sponsor of the amendment it was agreed that additional language was
necessary to close this loophole; and
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners does hereby urge
the General Assembly to amend 5 ILCS 430/70-20 with the following language to rectify this omission:
Sec. 70-20. Members appointed by a county. In addition to any other applicable requirement of law, any
member of a governmental entity appointed by the president or chairperson of a county board, with or without
the advice and consent of the county board, or appointed exclusively by county board members, shall abide
by the ethics laws applicable to, and the ethics policies of, that county and, if applicable, shall be subject to
the jurisdiction of that county’s ethics officer or inspector general.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a suitable copy of this Resolution be tendered to the General Assembly as
a record of our request.
A motion was made by Commissioner Goslin, seconded by Commissioner Schneider that this Resolution be
Received and Filed. The motion carried.

(a)
Any person who intentionally records or files or causes to be recorded or filed any document in
the Office of the Cook County Recorder of Deeds that is a cloud on the title of land in Cook County, knowing that

to the validity of the lien.
(d)
For purposes of this Section, the term “cloud on title” or “cloud on the title” means an
outstanding claim or encumbrance that, if valid, would affect or impair the title of the owner of an estate in land

PROPOSED MISCELLANEOUS ITEM OF BUSINESS
Department:

Capital Planning and Policy

Summary: The Office of Capital Planning and Policy, as authorized by the Cook County Chief Procurement
Officer, plans to participate in the Cook County’s Job Order Contract (JOC) program to complete the three (4)
capital projects listed below. JOC is a quantity based procurement process that allows facility owners to complete
a multitude of repair/maintenance and construction projects with a single, competitively bid contract. The JOC
process generally involves first selecting a pool of potential contractors through a competitive procurement
process, and then identifying projects for such selected contractors. The County has already completed a JOC
competitive procurement process, and it has created the pool of general contractors to perform certain projects
generally associated with maintenance, repairs, replacement and routine work.
The JOC program has an administrative component managed by the Gordian Group. The Gordian Group
maintains an area price book, which captures the prices for specific construction work items within this region.
JOC contractors bid against the prices included in the price book. The cost, therefore, of any work performed by
the contractor is a contractor markup from the price book. The Gordian Group would receive 5% administrative
fee from Cook County based on the total project cost of the work. The Gordian Group will manage the JOC
process and will verify that all proposals and work are compliant with the terms and conditions outlined in the
JOC contract with the County.
The Office of Capital Planning and Policy, proposes to assigns the projects listed below to the Gordian Group to
share with participating JOC contractors.
Project Descriptions
1.

DOC Division IX Cell Replacement - This project will remove and replace the existing windows
overlooking the gymnasium with a detention grade energy efficient window.

2.

DOC Division IV Plumbing Piping Replacement - This project will remove and replace the existing
shower units with an open shower area resulting in a more secure environment that is ADA compliant.

3.

DOC Division VI Plumbing Piping Replacement - This project will remove and replace the existing

Amendment to the IGA provides for the following actions:
1.

Temporary Easement Agreement. The County and the District agree to execute an Easement Agreement
upon completion of surveys and legal description for conveyance of approximately 1.418 acres for purposes
of constructing, inspecting, maintaining, repairing, replacing and removing a multi-purpose recreational

Summary: Since deploying Palantir Technologies Government Software at the Sheriff’s Office Intelligence
Center, the system has significantly enhanced investigatory abilities, streamlined criminal analysis, and helped
generate critical intelligence products that support the crime fighting efforts of law enforcement agencies across
Cook County. Palantir’s engineers have successfully connected the following data sources: I-Clear (the City of
Chicago Arrest Database), Cook County Sheriff’s Police Record Management System, the Jail Management
System, Protocol (the Electronic Monitoring database), Securus (the inmate phone system database), the
Computerized Dispatch System for the County (CAD), the Computerized Booking System for the County
(CABS) and the Regional Gang Intelligence Database (RIGID). These systems previously had no way to
communicate with one another. Palantir has provided the Sheriff’s Office Intelligence Center with the ability to
generate high level criminal intelligence products with unprecedented accuracy and efficiency. Currently, there is
a need to increase the number of licenses and servers of Palantir, in order to support the collection and exchange
of data with other law enforcement agencies throughout the county.

Summary: The purchase of 6,800 eLearning licenses will be used to train officers on the new JMS system.
Tribridge (the creator of the new JMS System) will provide electronic learning to the Cook County Sheriff’s
Office. This scope change will provide several benefits. First, correctional staff will be trained and tested at their
work stations, without having to come to a dedicated training center. Staff will be able to take the training
multiple times if they are unfamiliar with a specific section of the JMS system. Staff could also be quickly
trained on new areas of the system. We will also have the ability to track and provide confirmation of individual
staff training and test results.
