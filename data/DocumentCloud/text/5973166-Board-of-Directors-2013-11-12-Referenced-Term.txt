 Proposed Term Sheet – 2FM Project
Chicago Infrastructure Trust
Project Background:

In July, 2011 the Public Building Commission of Chicago (PBC)
issued a Request for Qualifications and Proposals to identify
energy services companies (ESCOs) to provide comprehensive
energy management and energy-related capital improvement
services for various types of public facilities. In December, 2011
seven (7) ESCOs submitted preliminary feasibility reports based on
the energy analyses of 10 representative public buildings. The
energy audits included: (i) a survey and review of available utility
data and facility mechanical equipment, operating parameters,
and systems; (ii) an estimate of potential energy savings over a
specified term for the various facilities; (iii) recommended energy
conservation measures (ECMs) for each facility; (iv) estimated
maximum cost of energy performance contracting services for the
facilities; (v) a description of grants or incentive programs and an
estimate of the potential grant or incentive funds available; and
(vi) estimated annual measurement and verification costs;.
In March 2012, based on the recommendations of an evaluation
committee composed of City of Chicago user agencies and subject
matter experts who reviewed the reports and interviewed each
ESCO team, the PBC Board recommended 3 ESCOS be chosen as
preferred vendors: Noresco, LLC, Ameresco, Inc. and Schneider
Electric Buildings Americas, Inc.. In July 2012 the three (3)
preferred ESCOs were assigned the task of analyzing 148 buildings
to determine which ones were suitable candidates for inclusion in
the Retrofit Chicago Program. In October 2012, Investment Grade
Audit Services Agreements were executed between the PBC and
each of the three (3) ESCOs. Collectively the ESCOs performed
Investment Grade Audits on 112 facilities. After a thorough
iterative review of the results, the Department of Fleet and
Facilities Management (2FM), with PBC assistance, accepted the
ESCO recommendations for 75 of those facilities. The final draft
Investment Grade Audit Reports were completed in May 2013.

Financing Opportunity:

Each energy services company will guarantee an annual amount
of savings based on the facilities that they evaluated and included
in their Final Investment Grade Audit Reports. Savings will be
aggregated into one financing (See Exhibit B of the Guaranteed
Energy Performance Contract (GEPC)).

 The amount of the transaction is approximately $27.5 million,
with financial closing anticipated to occur around December 15,
2013.
ESCO/Contractors:

Noresco, LLC
Ameresco, Inc.
Schneider Electric Buildings Americas, Inc.

Owner:

Chicago Infrastructure Trust (CIT). The CIT was created in April
2012 by a resolution of the City of Chicago (City). The CIT was
mandated to serve the following purposes: to provide funding and
credit support to qualifying infrastructure projects; play an
important role in coordinating and facilitating private investment
for infrastructure projects; have grant-making capabilities for
select infrastructure projects; and facilitate funding of
infrastructure projects affecting one or more co-ordinate units of
local government that will enable the sharing of labor, resources
and expertise between and among such units of local
government.
The CIT will enter into an Energy Services
Agreement (ESA) with the City of Chicago (See Energy Services
Agreement (ESA)).

Issuer:

The CIT will be a permitted issuer of tax-exempt obligations “on
behalf of” the City pursuant to authorities under section 103 of
the Internal revenue Code of 1986 (Revenue Ruling 57-187 and
60-248) (See Whereas Clauses in the Loan and Security
Agreement).

End User:

The City of Chicago.

Below is a diagram of the proposed deal structure:

 Project Documents:

Energy Savings Agreement (ESA) between the End User (City of
Chicago) and the Owner (CIT). Under the ESA, the End User will
agree to pay the Owner an amount equal to agreed upon savings
as long as the agreed upon savings amounts are achieved. (See
Article XIII, Section 8.1 of the ESA) If agreed upon savings are not
achieved in any year, the ESCO/Contractor will make up the
difference between actual savings and agreed upon savings. (See
Exhibit B, Section 1 of the GEPC)
Guaranteed Energy Performance Contract (GEPC) between
ESCO/Contractor and the CIT for the benefit of the City. Pursuant
to the GEPC, the CIT will enter into a program management
agreement with the Public Building Commission of Chicago. The
GEPC defines the scope of work, installation cost and timeline,
and savings guaranty associated with the Project. Each
ESCO/Contractor has a defined project associated with the
building group(s) they were assigned based on occupancy type. In
general, Noresco had responsibility for the installation of ECMs
within City Hall, Chicago fire stations and several warehouses
maintenance shops (See Exhibit A of the ESA). Ameresco had
responsibility for the installation of ECMs within a number of
Chicago libraries, and administrative buildings throughout the City
(See Exhibit A of the ESA). Schneider Electric had responsibility
for the installation of ECMs within various police stations, health
clinics and community service centers (See Exhibit A of the ESA).
The GEPCs are virtually identical in form with differences focused
on the various ECMs proposed for each facility. In general, savings

 are not guaranteed per individual ECM project or per building but
for the aggregate energy savings per ESCO group of ECMs.
Financing Agreement between the lender and the CIT (See Loan
and Security Agreement). The form of the financing agreement
will most likely be a Loan and Security Agreement. The CIT intends
to finance 100% of the cost of the Project, capitalized interest and
costs of issuance. There may be a small equity contribution to CIT
from the End User. The Financing Agreement will provide the
Lender with a security interest in the Project (See Section 7.01 of
the Loan and Security Agreement).
It is the intent of the CIT that the interest component of payments
received by the lender be excluded from gross income for
purposes of federal income taxation and should not be a
preference item for purposes of the federal alternative minimum
tax (See Section 2.02 of the Loan and Security Agreement).
Project Description:

Each ESCO/Contractor is scheduled to design and install similar
types of ECM projects; In general, these subprojects include:
installation of energy efficient light fixtures and lighting controls;
weatherization of building envelopes to reduce the infiltration of
unconditioned outside air; retro-commissioning of existing
mechanical systems bringing them into optimal operating
parameters; new Direct Digital Control (DDC) systems to better
control HVAC equipment; refurbishment or replacement of aging
HVAC components such as steam traps, radiator controls, air
handler seals, etc.; insulation of un-insulated piping and duct
work; and the installation of efficient motors and pumps in
conjunction with variable frequency drives. In addition, the ESCOs
will perform several “deeper retrofit” projects that involve the
replacement of antiquated equipment such as installation of
natural gas fired infrared heating in lieu of steam unit heaters;
conversion of constant volume air handlers to Variable Volume
and Temperature (VVT); demand control ventilation systems that
regulate outside make-up air; and the replacement of boilers and
chillers. (See Investment Grade Audit from each ESCO/Contractor
for a more complete description of ECMs).
