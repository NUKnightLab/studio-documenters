 GENERAL BACKGROUND
In September 2008, the CHA Board of Commissioners (“Board”) authorized the CHA to enter
into a one year contract with HCP to provide Good Neighbor services for residents currently
living in CHA developments and mixed-income communities, as well as former 10/1/99 CHA
residents who have temporarily relocated to the private market with a Housing Choice Voucher.
The Contact provided for an initial term of October 1, 2008 through September 30, 2009, with
two one-year option periods. In September 2009, the Board authorized the first one-year option
that extended the Contract through September 30, 2010. During the term of their contract, HCP
has performed all its contractual obligations.
The Contract’s primary focus is to conduct Good Neighbor workshops that will provide residents
moving into the scattered site portfolio through the Property Investment Initiative (“PII”) and
residents screening for Property Rental Assistance units (“PRA”) with the necessary tools to
maintain their household, their finances and foster positive and lasting relationships within their
communities. HCP conducts a series of workshops prior to residents being approved for a unit in
the PII portfolio and assists in the move-in process with the Property Manager and CHA. HCP
will provide a minimum of four (4) follow-up visits throughout the first year of residing in the
new unit.
Additionally, HCP will provide intensive, one-on-one services for residents in CHA’s family,
senior and mixed-income portfolios with lease compliance issues related to housekeeping.
Residents are referred by CHA (e.g. Resident Services, Asset Management, Office of the
Ombudsman) and CHA contractors (e.g. Property Management, FamilyWorks). HCP will work
with residents to develop an individual plan to maintain lease compliance including, but not
limited to, multiple in-home visits and hands on assistance (e.g. storage and organizational
assistance) for residents with housekeeping violations.
Based upon HCP’s performance on the contract, CHA desires to exercise the second option year
of the Contract through September 30, 2011. HCP staff is dedicated to creating a continuum of
services that will continue to provide residents with necessary household and community tools.
Based upon the foregoing, it is in the best interest of the CHA to authorize the Chief Executive
Officer or his designee, to exercise the second option year of Contract No. 8064 with HCP to
Good Neighbor services for the period of October 1, 2010 through September 30, 2011, and to
increase the funding in an amount not-to-exceed $390,000. The Contract’s new total not-toexceed compensation amount will be $946,000.
