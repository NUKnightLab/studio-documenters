REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR
Fine Free Policy
Mrs. Mondowney reported that on September 1, 2019, the Library implemented the "no
overdue fines" policy approved by the Detroit Library Commission at its June 18, 2019
meeting. Under the new policy, customers will no longer be charged overdue fines for
books and other materials that are returned in good condition. As part of the
implementation, unpaid overdue fines were removed from customer records. The
average fine forgiven was $8. The process returned approximately 145,00 library cards
to good standing.
Mrs. Mondowney reported that the new policy was enthusiastically received by
customers and the public. It received extensive and positive media coverage, including
stories in the Detroit Free Press, Crain’s Detroit Business, Detroit Metro Times, and
coverage on Deadline Detroit, Detour Detroiter, WXYZ Channel 7, MYTV Channel 20,
WJBK Channel 2, WDIV Channel 4’s “Live in the D,” and WWJ Radio 950, WDET
101.9, and Michigan Radio 91.7. The promotional campaign will continue throughout
the Fall.
The New Mobile Library
Mrs. Mondowney reported that a beautiful, new mobile library was delivered to the
Douglass Branch on August 26, 2019. The 34-foot long vehicle features two side doors
to facilitate the flow of visitors, and an interior system that allows staff to switch out
shelves, desks and benches, as needed. The mobile library is built on a 2020
Freightliner chassis that was selected because of its reliable service record and long
duty cycle of 17-20 years.
Minutes were approved at the October 15, 2019 Commission Meeting

September 17, 2019

Douglass staff are currently familiarizing themselves with the vehicle and our
Information Systems Department is configuring the on-board technology. A ribboncutting is planned for mid-October and special “open house” visits are being planned at
Sunday locations: Main Library, and the Wilder and Redford branches.
Detroit Public Library 10 Gigabit Network
Mrs. Mondowney reported that the Library’s new network allows all DPL sites to be
connected together with a maximum capacity of 10Gb. Some of the benefits of this high
bandwidth capacity include, but are not limited to: a stronger signal, higher reliability,
and improved security; the ability to stream videos faster and to offer more concurrent
internet sessions; and, an increase in data transfer speed and enhanced interactivity.
DPL Connects Detroiters to FCA Jobs
Mrs. Mondowney reported that DPL staff members are providing technology access and
test-prep materials to Detroiters who are pursuing employment opportunities with Fiat
Chrysler Automobiles (FCA). Through a connection with the Detroit’s Michigan Works
designated agency, Detroit Employment Solutions, the Library has made its public
access computers available for completing the online pre-application form, scheduling
attendance at a “Job Readiness” orientation and pre-testing. As those who have
completed the pre-screening process receive an emailed link from FCA inviting them to
submit formal application, the expectation is that many of them will also turn to DPL
locations to complete the online application and for test-prep resources. Dorothy Manty,
manager of Main Library’s Technology, Literacy and Career Center, has successfully
coordinated the Library’s involvement in this project.
Fine Arts Appraisal
Mrs. Mondowney reported that DuMouchelles Art Galleries performed an inventory of
85 artwork items at Main Library having a total insurance value of $29,121,000. The
most valuable single item is the ceiling in Adam Strohm Hall valued at $4.2 million. The
ceilings for the remainder of the 3rd floor are valued at a composite $8.2 million. The six
painted windows in Strohm Hall are valued at $2.4 million.
Microsoft Donation to Code: Grow Program
Mrs. Mondowney reported that Microsoft Corporation has donated $4,000 to support the
Parkman Branch’s Code: Grow program. Young people ages 10-17, learn to Code with
Python, a high level programming language. After planting a garden behind the branch
this summer, the young learners used Python programming language to build sensors
to track the water level in the garden. Quimisha Goss, Parkman Branch librarian,
developed and implemented this program.

Minutes were approved at the October 15, 2019 Commission Meeting

Wash & Learn Grant
Mrs. Mondowney reported that the Community Foundation for Southeastern Michigan
awarded the DPL a $35,000 grant to develop a “best practices” manual for “Wash &
Learn” programs at neighborhood laundromats. DPL’s grant partner, Libraries Without
Borders, will develop a manual based on DPL’s experience of offering Wash & Learn
programs in the Parkman, Wilder and Edison neighborhoods during the next year.
WDET Book Club
Mrs. Mondowney reported that this summer Stephen Henderson and the Detroit
Today’s WDET Book Club read Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha’s What the Eyes Don’t See:
The Story of Crisis, Resistance, and Hope in an American City, the story of the Flint
water crisis. During the summer the Book Club held conversations at libraries
throughout the region with guests who played a role in the book. On Tuesday,
September 10, 2019, 175 people attended the concluding program, which was held at
Main Library and featured Dr. Hanna-Attisha and Michigan’s Senate Minority Leader
Jim Ananich. What the Eyes Don’t See is a Library of Michigan 2019 Notable Book.
Taneca Chapman-Mills, Duffield Branch Manager, has been recently appointed to the
Notable Books Committee.
Duffield Branch: Tax Season Results
Mrs. Mondowney reported that Accounting Aid Society volunteers prepared 218 tax
returns at the Duffield Branch during the 2019 tax season. These returns yielded
$213,524 in refunds and saved individuals $65,400 in cost if they had used a
commercial tax preparer.
