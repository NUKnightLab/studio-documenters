President Beyna called the meeting to order and recognized Annuitant member Rosemarie Giambalvo
who had expressed interest in addressing the Board. Direction was given that the public comment section
is for members to express their concerns and views. It is not a question and answer session.
Ms. Giambalvo directed her comments concerning Section 5-211 of the Pension Code concerning the
Board’s hiring of an additional attorney. Her further comments addressed the City’s responsibility for the
payment of costs associated with Disability benefits and the rational concerning the Board’s expenditures
for members already in receipt of disability benefits.
President Beyna informed Ms. Giambalvo that the Board would take her questions under advisement.
President Beyna then acknowledged Annuitant member Paul Tasch who had also previously expressed
interest in addressing the Board. Mr. Tasch’s comments centered on the Funding level of the Fund and
recent legislative changes; an apparent lack of interest in Board matters by the Fund’s active members and
his opinion that the Fund provide additional information about the Fund’s affairs to all members on a
more frequent basis. Mr. Tasch also requested that the Fund provide additional Investment return
information, on a manager by manager basis, on its website.
Finally, President Beyna also acknowledged Annuitant member Gary Oprondek who was the third
