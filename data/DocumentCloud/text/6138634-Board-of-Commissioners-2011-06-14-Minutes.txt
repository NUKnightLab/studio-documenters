adequate and the maintenance cost information required.

e.

A request for a new vehicle which increases the number of vehicles in the
department's vehicle inventory shall be submitted to the Vehicle Steering
Committee with a written justification as to why the additional vehicles will be
required. Such request must demonstrate that reassignment of existing vehicles
would be unable to meet department needs and that sufficient funding is available
for both the purchase and the cost of operating and maintaining the vehicle. The
request to purchase must state the use intended for the vehicle, whether the

PROPOSED RESOLUTION

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 14, 2011
HONORING THE COOK COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF FACILITIES MANAGEMENT
FOR THE 2011 NACO ACHIEVEMENT AWARD FOR PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT,
EMPLOYEE TRAINING AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
ALTERNATIVE WORK PROGRAM-FACILITIES MANAGEMENT
WHEREAS, In January of 2009, The Cook County Department of Facilities Management identified that
the County had multiple employees off of work due to injury or illness. Facilities Management recognized
that many non-administrative employees (Skilled Trades and Engineers) who were currently collecting
disability benefits could return to work in administrative functions. Over the past two years, Facilities
Management has had eleven (11) employees participate in the newly created Alternative Work Program;
and
WHEREAS, Cook County has endured multiple budget cuts over the past four years and many
administrative positions have been eliminated. With an expanding workload and fewer staff, AWP
participants have performed many clerical functions including: answering phones, entering work orders
into the work order system, filing, and other miscellaneous office duties. Upon completion of the AWP,
participants gain a better understanding and awareness of clerical, administration, and management
challenges and expectations; and
WHEREAS, as with many Counties in the United States, Cook County’s pension system is minimally
underfunded. All employees that become disabled while they are still employed are paid partially through
the pension system. Enrolling employees into the AWP and getting these employees back to work has
saved money within the system; and
WHEREAS, the Department of Facilities Management is very accustomed to the fact that employees will
get hurt while on the job. There is always a higher risk of injury within the service occupations. In fact,
according to OSHA statistics service workers account for 53.4 % of all injuries in the public sector.
Employees spend months, if not years, on disability. One of the reasons employees were off for such a
long period of time due to the fact that the administration did not actively pursue bringing these
employees back to work; and
WHEREAS, Cook County has been under budget constraints for the past seven years and has had to
continually lay off administrative staff in order to fulfill their budget obligations. The administrators
within Facilities Management needed help with simple tasks that could not be completed due to
expanding workload and fewer staff. The administration was left with only a couple feasible options: 1)
Hire more staff. 2) Better utilize the workforce that was already in place. Due to the current budget
constraints, all innovative ideas were considered; and
WHEREAS, as with many Counties in the United States, Cook County’s pension system is minimally
underfunded. All employees that become injured while they are employed with Cook County are paid
partially through the pension system. When an employee files for ordinary disability benefits (non-work
related injury) the employee is paid 50% of their salary for the duration of their time off. The entire
disability payment is made from the pension system. In cases where an employee files for duty disability
benefits (work related injury) the employee is paid 8 1/3% of their salary from the pension fund and 66
2/3% from Workers’ Compensation; and
WHEREAS, the overall objective of the program is to bring service employees (Skilled Trades,
Engineers, etc.) who are on disability back to work in a clerical function as effectively as possible. Each
employee is taken on a case by case basis. An example would be that Employee A has a torn ACL and
hypothetically won’t be able to return to work in six months while Employee B has a broken foot and
could return in six weeks.

36

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 14, 2011

WHEREAS, the overall methodology is that an employee who is recovering from an injury would be
more likely to return to their original function (Skilled Trades, Engineer, etc.) more expeditiously if they
were already back to work in a clerical function than if the same employee was recovering from their
injury at home; and
WHEREAS, the Department of Facilities Management has partnered with the Department of Risk
Management to begin requesting physician documentation regarding work restrictions that an employee
would have if they were approved to come back to work in an administrative function (also known as
light duty). This is a crucial first step, because physicians have become increasingly more cautious on
work restrictions because they don’t want a lawsuit filed against them by either the employee or the
employer; and
WHEREAS, once a physician has submitted work restrictions and has authorized that an employee can
work in an administrative function, Facilities Management assigns the employee to an administrative
function within the Work Order Division. The Work Order Division is responsible for opening and
closing of work requests, disseminating work requests, and filing daily time logs for the department. The
WOD processes an average on 150,000 work requests each year through a computerized work order
system; and
WHEREAS, after the employee begins working as a member of the work order staff, he/she will receive
proper training on: basic computer skills, work order processing, basic clerical skills, answering and
transferring of the phone, and filing. This can be an overwhelming for an employee that has never spent
time in an office environment before, but over time the AWP participants adapt; and
WHEREAS, once an employee is enrolled in the AWP, the only way to get removed is to either: return
to full duty, physician release back to disability, or resignation. Of the eleven employees that have been
assigned to the program: seven have returned back to their original position, three have resigned, and one
is still enrolled; and
WHEREAS, one of the best parts of the AWP is the fact that Facilities Management has not incurred any
additional costs for implementation. The major costs for implementing this type of program would be:
supervision of participants, desktop computers, and work order entry software; and
WHEREAS, all members that participate are supervised by the current data entry supervisor. The
supervisor already supervises nine (9) employees and adding additional employees has proven to not be
an additional burden. Facilities Management had additional computers that were in storage due to their
age. AWP employees did not require top of the line systems, so they were issued refurbished computers
that were approximately four years old. The last major expense was the work order system which is
already in place within Facilities Management; and
WHEREAS, the overall goal of the Alternative Work Program is to get employees back to work full time
so they can complete their function that they were hired to do. The average time spent by AWP
participants in the program is 6 months while non-participants spend over a year to return to work. There
have been many other successes along the way that have added to the programs overall success including:
financial savings, better understanding of administrative functions, and innovative administrative ideas;
and
WHEREAS, financials savings was the easiest and most obvious result. The eleven individuals that have
gone through the program would have accumulated over $500,000 in wages while not working. This

37

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 14, 2011
savings is broken down into $90,000 savings for the pension fund and $410,000 savings for workers
compensation; and
WHEREAS, due to increased facility oversight, the amount of paperwork that is required throughout the
department has grown exponentially over the past few years. With the help of AWP participants,
Facilities Management has been able to organize and process their needed paperwork much more
effectively. “I found out that there is a never-ending process of paperwork that I never knew existed” said
AWP participant Andrew Ryndak, “Once I got back on regular duty, I learned how to manage and get my
paperwork done a lot faster and easier”; and
WHEREAS, when it comes to innovative ideas, there is always an added benefit when a newcomer is
trained in performing administrative functions. One of the AWP participants single-handedly changed
the filing system for daily tracking logs that are used by tradesmen. This individual saw that the filing
was grossly inefficient and since his departure six months ago, the filing system has stayed intact and is
still the model for filing such paperwork. Another AWP participant developed a “Key Phrase” document
that identifies work processes commonly used by tradesmen. This document will be disseminated to
bring continuity to our work requests.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, the Cook County Department of Facilities Management has
taken a proactive approach to bringing men and women back to work that would otherwise have been
sitting at home while they were recovering from their injuries. Facilities Management has worked to
create a positive experience for both the AWP participant and the administration. Counties across the
United States are looking for ways to fully utilize their personnel and to give such personnel proper
training and departmental understanding while also saving money. The Cook County Department of
Facilities Management has been able to achieve this goal and has developed a usable model for other
Counties and would humbly accept a NACo Achievement Award for the Alternative Work Program; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, the Cook County Finance Subcommittee on Pension should convene to
discuss how to implement this proactive approach Countywide.

for an industrial facility; and
WHEREAS, the County Board of Commissioners has received and reviewed an application
from Ascent CH2, LLC and Resolution No. R-11-2010 from the City of Northlake for an

purchaser in whom the seller has no direct financial interest; and
WHEREAS, in the instance where the property does not meet the definition of abandoned
property, the municipality or the Board of Commissioners, may determine that special
circumstances justify finding that the property is abandoned for purpose of Class 6b; and
WHEREAS, in the case of abandonment of less than 24 months and purchase for value, by a
purchaser in whom the seller has no direct financial interest, the County may determine that

Enterprise Construction Interim Ordinance" and may be cited as such.
Sec. 34-287. Recitals.

of the recitals contained in the preambles to Ordinance No. 06-O-48 are full, true and
correct and do incorporate them into this subdivision by this reference.
Sec. 34-288. - Findings of discrimination.
The President and the Board of Commissioners of the County of Cook, after
considering (i) evidence presented at trial in Builders Association of Greater Chicago v.
City of Chicago, 298 F.Supp.2d 725 (N.D. Ill. 2003) and Northern Contracting, Inc. v.
Illinois Department of Transportation, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19868 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 8,

Status of Minority - and Women Owned Business Enterprises Relevant to Construction
Activity In and Around Cook County, Illinois,” submitted by Colette Holt & Associates,
and NERA Economic Consulting, and dated June 22, 2010 (the “NERA Study”): as well
as (iv) anecdotal evidence of discrimination against minorities and women in the County's
construction marketplace; and (v) receiving and considering written reports, adopts the
following findings as a strong basis in evidence supporting a narrowly tailored, remedial
affirmative action program in County construction contracting:
(a)
The County of Cook seeks to provide a level playing field and equal
access for all prime contractors and subcontractors to participate in County construction
contracting opportunities;
(b)
Since After the County's affirmative action program as it relates to
construction projects was declared unconstitutional in 2000, the County has witnessed a

heard anecdotal evidence of discrimination in the construction industry, has commissioned
a and reviewed the NERA Studystudy on the levels of M/WBE participation in County
contracts, has reviewed the report prepared indicating evidence of discrimination in County
construction contracts and has considered the evidence in relevant case law;
(d)
In the absence of M/WBE participation goals the County has witnessed a
drastic decline in M/WBE participation in its construction contract below the availability
of such firms and thus would be a passive participant in a discriminatory marketplace
without the use of such M/WBE goals;
(e)
The County has a compelling interest in preventing discrimination; and
The NERA Study made recommendations for a revised Minority and Women owned
business program for construction contracting, emphasizing the establishment of Projectspecific goals, implementation of race and gender neutral measures, and enhancements to
data gathering, implementation and performance monitoring of the program;
(f)
The County has a compelling interest in preventing discrimination and
desires to reaffirm its commitment to full and fair opportunities for all firms to participate
in its construction contracts.
Sec. 34-289. Public purpose.
It is hereby found, determined and declared that the purpose of this Interim
Ordinance is to take steps to ensure the full and equitable participation of Minority - and
Women-Owned Business Enterprises in the County's procurement process as both prime
and subcontractors in the County's construction contracts. The County is committed to a
policy of preventing discrimination in the award of or participation in construction
contracts and has recommended appropriate affirmative action steps to be taken narrowly
tailored remedies to eliminate any such discrimination.
Sec. 34-290. Applicability.
This subdivision shall apply to all construction contracts funded in whole or in part
by County funds, regardless of the sources of other funds; provided that any contract with

99

by a preponderance of the evidence.
(b)

Only a firm owned by a Socially and Economically Disadvantaged

105

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 14, 2011
person(s) may be certified as a MBE or WBE.
(1)

The firm's ownership by a Socially and Economically Disadvantaged
person must be real, substantial, and continuing, going beyond pro forma
ownership of the firm as reflected in ownership documents. The owner(s)
must enjoy the customary incidents of ownership and share in the risks and
profits commensurate with that ownership interest.

(2)

The contributions of capital or Expertise by the Socially and Economically
Disadvantaged owner(s) to acquire the ownership interest must be real and
substantial. If Expertise is relied upon as part of a Socially and
Economically Disadvantaged owner's contribution to acquire ownership,
the Expertise must be of the requisite quality generally recognized in a
specialized field, in areas critical to the firm's operations, indispensable to
the firm's potential success, specific to the type of work the firm performs
and documented in the firm's records. The individual whose Expertise is
relied upon must have a commensurate financial investment in the firm.

(c)
Only a firm that is managed and controlled by a Socially and
Economically Disadvantaged person(s) may be certified as a MBE or WBE.
(1)

A firm must not be subject to any formal or informal restrictions that limit
the customary discretion of the Socially and Economically Disadvantaged
owner(s). There can be no restrictions through corporate charter
provisions, by-law provisions, contracts or any other formal or informal
devices that prevent the Socially and Economically Disadvantaged
owner(s), without the cooperation or vote of any non-Socially and
Economically Disadvantaged person, from making any business decision
of the firm, including the making of obligations or the dispersing
disbursing of funds.

(2)

The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) must possess the
power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of
the firm and to make day-to-day as well as long-term decisions on
management, policy, operations and work.

(3)

The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) may delegate
various areas of the management or daily operations of the firm to persons
who are not Socially and Economically Disadvantaged. Such delegations
of authority must be revocable, and the Socially and Economically
Disadvantaged owner(s) must retain the power to hire and fire any such
person. The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) must
actually exercise control over the firm's operations, work, management
and policy.

(4)

The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) must have an
overall understanding of, and managerial and technical competence,
experience and Expertise, directly related to the firm's operations and
work. The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) must have
the ability to intelligently and critically evaluate information presented by
other participants in the firm's activities and to make independent

106

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 14, 2011
decisions concerning the firm's daily operations, work, management, and
policymaking.
(5)

If federal, state and/or local laws, regulations or statutes require the
owner(s) to have a particular license or other credential to own and/or
control a certain type of firm, then the Socially and Economically
Disadvantaged owner(s) must possess the required license or credential. If
state law, County ordinance or other law regulations or statute does not
require that the owner posses the license or credential, that the owner(s)
lacks such license or credential is a factor, but is not dispositive, in
determining whether the Socially and Economically Disadvantaged
owner(s) actually controls the firm.

(6)

A Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner cannot engage in
outside employment or other business interests that conflict with the
management of the firm or prevent the owner from devoting sufficient
time and attention to the affairs of the firm to manage and control its day
to day activities.

(d)
Only an independent firm may be certified as a MBE or WBE. An
independent firm is one whose viability does not depend on its relationship with another
firm. Recognition of an applicant as a separate entity for tax or corporate purposes is not
necessarily sufficient to demonstrate that a firm is independent and non-Affiliated. In
determining whether an applicant is an independent business Business, the CC Director
will:
(1)

Scrutinize relationships with non-Certified Firms in such areas as
personnel, facilities, equipment, financial and/or bonding support, and
other resources.

(2)

Consider whether present or recent employer/employee relationships
between the Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) of the
applicant and non-Certified Firms or persons associated with non-Certified
Firms compromise the applicant's independence.

(3)

Examine the applicant's relationships with non-Certified Firms to
determine whether a pattern of exclusive or primary dealings with nonCertified Firm compromises the applicant's independence.

(4)

Consider the consistency of relationships between the applicant and nonCertified Firms with normal industry practice.

(e)
An applicant shall be certified only for specific types of work in which the
Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) has the ability and Expertise to
manage and control the firm's operations and work.
(f)
The County shall certify the eligibility of Joint Ventures involving MBEs
or WBEs and non-Certified Firms. To be considered an eligible Joint Venture, at least one
partner of the Joint Venture must be a Certified Firm, with a share in the capital
contribution, control, management, risks, and profits of the Joint Venture which is equal to
its ownership interest.. Each Certified Firm partner must contribute property, capital,

107

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 14, 2011
efforts, skill and knowledge and be responsible for a distinct, clearly defined portion of the
work of the contract.
(g)
In lieu of conducting its own certifications, the CC Director by rule may
accept formal certifications by other entities as meeting the requirements of the Program, if
the CC Director determines that the certification standards of such entities are comparable
to those of the County.
(h)
The certification status of all MBEs and WBEs shall be reviewed
periodically by the Office of Contract Compliance. Failure of the firm to seek
recertification by filing the necessary documentation with the CC Director as provided by
rule may result in decertification.
(i)
It is the responsibility of the Certified Firm to notify the CC Director of
any change in its circumstances affecting its continued eligibility for the Program,
including decertification by another agency. Failure to do so may result in the firm's
decertification.
(j)
The CC Director shall decertify a firm that does not continuously meet the
eligibility criteria.
(k)
Decertification by another agency shall create a prima facie case for
decertification by the County. The challenged firm shall have the burden of proving that its
County certification should be maintained.
(l)
A firm that has been denied certification or recertification or has been
decertified may protest the denial or decertification as provided by rule.
(m)
A firm found to be ineligible may not apply for certification for six (6)
months after the effective date of the final decision.
(n)
A third party may challenge the eligibility of an applicant for certification
or a Certified Firm as provided by rule. Such challenges shall be signed and sworn by the
individual challenging the eligibility of an applicant for certification or a certified form.
The burden of proof shall rest with the complainant. Such challenges to eligibility shall be
subject to an appeal. The CC Director shall be the final arbiter of all challenges. The
presumption that the challenged firm is eligible shall remain in effect until the County CC
Director renders a final decision.
Sec. 34-296. Annual aspirational goals.
The Annual Aspirational Goals for the utilization of MBEs and WBEs on County
construction contracts and subcontracts shall be 24 percent for MBEs and four (4) percent
for WBEs.
Sec. 34-297. Project specific goals.
The CC Director, in consultation with the User Department, shall establish Project
Specific Goals for construction Contracts based upon the availability of at least three
MBEs and three WBEs to perform the anticipated subcontracting functions of the project
and the County's utilization of MBEs and WBEs to date.

108

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 14, 2011

Sec. 34-298. Counting MBE and WBE participation.
(a)
The entire amount of that portion of a contract that is performed by the
MBEs or WBEs own forces shall be counted, including the cost of supplies and materials
obtained by the MBE or WBE for the work of the contract, and supplies purchased or
equipment leased by the MBE or WBE (except supplies and equipment the MBE or WBE
purchases or leases from the prime Contractor or the prime Contractor's Affiliate).
(b)
The entire amount of fees or commissions charged by a MBE or WBE for
providing a bona fide service, such as professional, technical, consultant or managerial
services, or for providing bonds or insurance specifically required for the performance of a
contract, shall be counted, provided the fee is reasonable and not excessive as compared
with fees customarily charged for similar services.
(c)
When a MBE or WBE performs as a participant in a Joint Venture, only
the portion of the total dollar value of the contract equal to the distinct, clearly defined
portion of the work of the Joint Venture's contract that is performed by the MBE or WBE
with its own forces and for which it is separately at risk, shall be counted.
(d)
Only expenditures to a MBE or WBE that is performing a Commercially
Useful Function shall be counted. To determine whether a MBE or WBE is performing a
Commercially Useful Function, the County will evaluate the amount of work
subcontracted, industry practices, whether the amount the MBE or WBE is to be paid
under the contract is commensurate with the work it is actually performing and other
relevant factors. To perform a Commercially Useful Function, the MBE or WBE must be
responsible, with respect to materials and supplies used on the contract, for negotiating
price, determining quality and quantity, ordering the material, installing (where applicable)
and paying for the material itself. A MBE or WBE does not perform a Commercially
Useful Function if its role is limited to that of an extra participant in the contract through
which funds are passed in order to obtain the appearance of MBE or WBE participation. If
a MBE or WBE subcontracts a greater portion of the work of a contract than would be
expected based on normal industry practice, it is presumed not to perform a Commercially
Useful Function. When a MBE or WBE is presumed not to be performing a Commercially
Useful Function, the Certified Firm may present evidence to rebut this presumption.
(e)
One hundred percent of the cost of the materials or supplies obtained from
a MBE or WBE Manufacturer or Regular Dealer shall be counted. One hundred percent of
the fees or transportation charges for the delivery of materials or supplies required on a job
site shall be counted only if the payment of such fees is a customary industry practice and
are commensurate with fees customarily charged for similar services.
(f)
If a firm ceases to be a certified Certified Firm during its performance on a
contract, the dollar value of work performed under a contract with that firm after it has
ceased to be certified shall not be counted.
(g)
In determining achievement of Project Specific Goals, the participation of
a MBE or WBE shall not be counted until that amount has been paid to the MBE or WBE.
Sec. 34-299. Contract pre-award compliance procedures.

109

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 14, 2011
(a)
For all solicitations, the bidder/proposer shall submit a Utilization Plan
detailing all subcontractors from which the Contractor solicited bids or quotations, and if
Project Specific Goals have been established, its achievement of the Goals or its Good
Faith Efforts to do so. The Utilization Plan shall be due at the time the bid / proposal is
due.
(b)
Any agreement between a Contractor and a MBE or WBE in which the
Contractor requires that the MBE or WBE not provide subcontracting quotations to other
Contractors is prohibited.
(c)
Where the Contractor cannot achieve the Project Specific Goal(s), the CC
Director will determine whether the Contractor has made Good Faith Efforts to meet the
Goal(s). In making this determination, the CC Director will consider, at a minimum, the
Contractor's efforts to:
(1)

Solicit through all reasonable and available means (e.g., attendance at prebid meetings, advertising and written notices) the interest of all MBEs and
WBEs certified in the scopes of work of the contract. The Contractor shall
provide interested MBEs and WBEs with timely, adequate information
about the plans, specifications, and requirements of the contract to allow
MBEs and WBEs to respond to the solicitation. The Contractor must
follow up initial solicitations with interested MBEs and WBEs.

(2)

Select portions of the work to be performed by MBEs and WBEs in order
to increase the likelihood that the Project Specific Goals will be achieved.
This includes, where appropriate, breaking out contract work items into
economically feasible units to facilitate MBE and WBE participation, even
when the Contractor would otherwise prefer to perform these work items
with its own forces. It is the Contractor's responsibility to make a portion
of the work available to MBEs and WBEs and to select those portions of
the work or material needs consistent with the availability MBEs and
WBEs to facilitate their participation.

(3)

Negotiate in good faith with interested MBEs and WBEs. Evidence of
such negotiation includes the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of
MBEs and WBEs that were contacted; a description of the information
provided regarding the plans and specifications for the work selected for
subcontracting; and why agreements could not be reached with MBEs and
WBEs. The Contractor may not reject MBEs and WBEs as being
unqualified without sound reasons based on a thorough investigation of
their capabilities. That there may be some additional costs involved in
finding and using MBEs and WBEs is not in itself sufficient reason for a
Contractor's failure to meet the Project Specific Goals, as long as such
costs are reasonable. The ability or desire of a Contractor to perform the
work of a contract with its own organization does not relieve it of the
responsibility to make Good Faith Efforts on all subcontractable scopes of
work that could be subcontracted.

(4)

Make efforts to assist interested MBEs and WBEs in obtaining bonding,
lines of credit, or insurance as required by the County or the prime
Contractor, where appropriate.

110

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 14, 2011

(5)

Make efforts to assist interested MBEs and WBEs in obtaining necessary
equipment, supplies, materials, or related assistance or services, where
appropriate.

(6)

Use the services of the Office of Contract Compliance, available
minority/women community organizations, minority/women contractors'
groups, government sponsored minority/women business assistance
offices and other appropriate organizations to provide assistance in the
recruitment and placement of MBEs and WBEs.

(e)
In determining whether a Contractor has made Good Faith Efforts, the
performance of other Contractors in meeting the Project Specific Goals may be considered.
For example, when the apparent successful Contractor fails to meet the Project Specific
Goals but others meet it, it may be reasonably questioned whether, with additional
reasonable efforts, the apparent successful Contractor could have met the Project Specific
Goals. Similarly, if the apparent successful Contractor fails to meet the Project Specific
Goals, but meets or exceeds the average MBE or WBE participation obtained by other
Contractors, this may be evidence that the apparent successful Contractor made Good Faith
Efforts.
(f)
A signed letter of intent from each listed MBE or WBE, describing the
work, materials, equipment or services to be performed or provided by the MBE or WBE
and the agreed upon dollar value shall be due at the time of bid proposal or within three
days after such submission.
(g)
The CC Director shall timely review the Utilization Plan before award,
including the scope of work and the letters of intent from MBEs and WBEs. The CC
Director may request clarification in writing of items listed in the Utilization Plan,
provided such clarification shall not include the opportunity to augment listed participation
or Good Faith Efforts.
(h)
If the CC Director determines that the Utilization Plan demonstrates that
the Project Specific Goals have been achieved or Good Faith Efforts made, with the
concurrence of the User Department, the CC Director and User Department shall
recommend award to Purchasing Agent Department.
(i)
If the CC Director finds that a Contractor did not make sufficient Good
Faith Efforts, the CC Director shall communicate this finding to the User Purchasing
Department and recommend that the bid/proposal be rejected. A Contractor may protest
this determination pursuant to the County's bid protest procedures.
Sec. 34-300. Contract administration procedures.
(a)
Upon award of a contract by the County that includes Project Specific
Goals, the Project Specific Goals become covenants of performance by the Contractors in
favor of the County and incorporated in the contract.
(b)
The Contractor shall provide a listing of all subcontractors to be used in
the performance of the contract, and detailed subcontractor information to the County with
each request for payment submitted to the County or as otherwise directed by the County.

111

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 14, 2011
The CC Director and the User Department shall monitor subcontractor participation during
the course of the contract. The County shall have full and timely access to the Contractor's
books and records, including without limitation payroll records, tax returns and records
and books of account, to determine the Contractor's compliance with its commitment to
MBE and WBE participation and the status of any MBE or WBE performing any portion
of the contract. This provision shall be in addition to, and not a substitute for, any other
provision allowing inspection of the Contractor's records by any officer or official of the
County for any purpose.
(c)
The Contractor cannot make changes to the Utilization Plan or substitute
MBEs or WBEs named in the Utilization Plan without the prior written approval of the CC
Director, Purchasing Agent and the User Department. Unauthorized changes or
substitutions shall be a violation of this subdivision and a breach of contract, and may
constitute grounds for rejection of the bid or proposal or cause termination of the executed
contract for breach, the withholding of payment and/or subject the Contractor to contract
penalties or other sanctions.
(1)

All requests for changes or substitutions of a MBE or WBE
Subcontractor(s) named in the Utilization Plan shall be made to the CC
Director, Purchasing Agent and the User Department in writing, and shall
clearly and fully set forth the basis for the request. A Contractor shall not
substitute a MBE or WBE subcontractor or perform the work designated
for a MBE or WBE subcontractor with its own forces unless and until the
CC Director, Purchasing Agent and in consultation with the User
Department, approve approves such substitution in writing. A Contractor
shall not allow a substituted subcontractor to begin work until both the
Director, Purchasing Agent and the User Department have approved the
substitution.

(2)

The facts supporting the request must not have been known nor reasonably
should have been known by either party before the submission of the
Utilization Plan. Bid shopping is prohibited. The Contractor must
negotiate with the MBE or WBE subcontractor to resolve the problem.
Where there has been a mistake or disagreement about the scope of work,
the MBE or WBE can be substituted only where an agreement cannot be
reached for a reasonable price for the correct scope of work.

(3)

Substitutions of the subcontractor shall be permitted only on the following

bases:
(i)

Unavailability after receipt of reasonable notice to proceed.

(ii)

Failure of performance.

(iii)

Financial incapacity.

(iv)

Refusal by the subcontractor to honor the bid or proposal price.

(v)

Mistake of fact or law about the elements of the scope of work of
a solicitation where agreement upon a reasonable price cannot be
reached.

112

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 14, 2011

(vi)

Failure of the subcontractor to meet insurance, licensing or
bonding requirements; or

(vii)

The subcontractor's withdrawal of its bid or proposal.

(4)

The County's final decision whether to permit or deny the proposed
substitution, and the basis of any denial, shall be communicated to the
parties in writing by the CC Director.

(5)

Where the Contractor has established the basis for the substitution to the
satisfaction of the County, the Contractor shall make Good Faith Efforts to
fulfill the Utilization Plan. The Contractor may seek the assistance of the
Office of Contract Compliance in obtaining a new MBE or WBE. If the
Project Specific Goal(s) cannot be reached and Good Faith Efforts have
been made, the Contractor may substitute with a non-Certified Firm.

(6)

If the County requires the substitution of a MBE or WBE subcontractor
listed in the Utilization Plan, the Contractor shall undertake Good Faith
Efforts to fulfill the Utilization Plan. The Contractor may seek the
assistance of the Office of Contract Compliance in obtaining a new MBE
or WBE subcontractor. If the Goal(s) cannot be reached and Good Faith
Efforts have been made, the Contractor may substitute with a nonCertified Firm.

(d)
If a Contractor plans to hire a subcontractor on any scope of work that was
not previously disclosed in the Utilization Plan, the Contractor shall obtain the approval of
the CC Director to modify the Utilization Plan and must make Good Faith Efforts to ensure
that MBES and WBEs have a fair opportunity to bid on the new scope of work.
(e)
Changes to the scopes of work shall be documented by the User
Department at the time they arise to establish the reasons for the change and the effect on
achievement of the MBE or WBE goal.
(f)
Prior to contract closeout, the CC Director shall evaluate the Contractor's
fulfillment of the contracted goals, taking into account all approved substitutions,
terminations and changes to the contract's scope of work. If the County determines that
Good Faith Efforts to meet the MBE or WBE commitments were not made, or that
fraudulent misrepresentations have been made, or any other breach of the contract or
violation of this subdivision, a remedy or sanction may be imposed, as provided in the
contract.
Sec. 34-301. Sanctions and penalties.
(a)

passive participant in a discriminatory marketplace.
(d)
On or before the sunset date of this Chapter, the County shall review the

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 14, 2011
marketplace; and (v) receiving and considering written reports, adopts the following
findings as a strong basis in evidence supporting a narrowly tailored, remedial affirmative
action program in County construction contracting:
(a)
The County of Cook seeks to provide a level playing field and equal access
for all prime contractors and subcontractors to participate in County construction
contracting opportunities;
(b)
Since After the County's affirmative action program as it relates to
construction projects was declared unconstitutional in 2000, the County has witnessed a
drastic reduction in M/WBE construction prime contract and subcontract participation;

heard anecdotal evidence of discrimination in the construction industry, has commissioned a
and reviewed the NERA Studystudy on the levels of M/WBE participation in County
contracts, has reviewed the report prepared indicating evidence of discrimination in County
construction contracts and has considered the evidence in relevant case law;

(d)
In the absence of M/WBE participation goals the County has witnessed a
drastic decline in M/WBE participation in its construction contract below the availability of
such firms and thus would be a passive participant in a discriminatory marketplace without
the use of such M/WBE goals;
(e)
The County has a compelling interest in preventing discrimination; and The
NERA Study made recommendations for a revised Minority and Women owned business
program for construction contracting, emphasizing the establishment of Project-specific
goals, implementation of race and gender neutral measures, and enhancements to data
gathering, implementation and performance monitoring of the program;
(f)
The County has a compelling interest in preventing discrimination and
desires to reaffirm its commitment to full and fair opportunities for all firms to participate in
its construction contracts.
Sec. 34-289. Public purpose.
It is hereby found, determined and declared that the purpose of this Interim
Ordinance is to take steps to ensure the full and equitable participation of Minority - and
Women-Owned Business Enterprises in the County's procurement process as both prime
and subcontractors in the County's construction contracts. The County is committed to a
policy of preventing discrimination in the award of or participation in construction contracts
and has recommended appropriate affirmative action steps to be taken narrowly tailored
remedies to eliminate any such discrimination.
Sec. 34-290. Applicability.
This subdivision shall apply to all construction contracts funded in whole or in part
by County funds, regardless of the sources of other funds; provided that any contract with
respect to which a goal for Minority-Owned Business Enterprise or Women-Owned

122

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 14, 2011

(2)

The contributions of capital or Expertise by the Socially and Economically
Disadvantaged owner(s) to acquire the ownership interest must be real and
substantial. If Expertise is relied upon as part of a Socially and
Economically Disadvantaged owner's contribution to acquire ownership,
the Expertise must be of the requisite quality generally recognized in a
specialized field, in areas critical to the firm's operations, indispensable to
the firm's potential success, specific to the type of work the firm performs
and documented in the firm's records. The individual whose Expertise is
relied upon must have a commensurate financial investment in the firm.

(c)
Only a firm that is managed and controlled by a Socially and Economically
Disadvantaged person(s) may be certified as a MBE or WBE.
(1)

A firm must not be subject to any formal or informal restrictions that limit
the customary discretion of the Socially and Economically Disadvantaged
owner(s). There can be no restrictions through corporate charter provisions,
by-law provisions, contracts or any other formal or informal devices that
prevent the Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s), without
the cooperation or vote of any non-Socially and Economically
Disadvantaged person, from making any business decision of the firm,
including the making of obligations or the dispersing disbursing of funds.

(2)

concerning the firm's daily operations, work, management, and
policymaking.

(5)

123

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 14, 2011
state law, County ordinance or other law regulations or statute does not
require that the owner posses the license or credential, that the owner(s)

determining whether the Socially and Economically Disadvantaged
owner(s) actually controls the firm.
(6)

outside employment or other business interests that conflict with the
management of the firm or prevent the owner from devoting sufficient time
and attention to the affairs of the firm to manage and control its day to day
activities.
(d)
Only an independent firm may be certified as a MBE or WBE. An
independent firm is one whose viability does not depend on its relationship with another
firm. Recognition of an applicant as a separate entity for tax or corporate purposes is not
necessarily sufficient to demonstrate that a firm is independent and non-Affiliated. In
determining whether an applicant is an independent business Business, the CC Director
will:
(1)

Scrutinize relationships with non-Certified Firms in such areas as
personnel, facilities, equipment, financial and/or bonding support, and other
resources.

(2)

Consider whether present or recent employer/employee relationships
between the Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) of the
applicant and non-Certified Firms or persons associated with non-Certified
Firms compromise the applicant's independence.

(3)

Examine the applicant's relationships with non-Certified Firms to determine
whether a pattern of exclusive or primary dealings with non-Certified Firm
compromises the applicant's independence.

(4)

Consider the consistency of relationships between the applicant and nonCertified Firms with normal industry practice.

(e)
An applicant shall be certified only for specific types of work in which the
Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) has the ability and Expertise to manage
and control the firm's operations and work.
(f)
The County shall certify the eligibility of Joint Ventures involving MBEs or
WBEs and non-Certified Firms. To be considered an eligible Joint Venture, at least one
partner of the Joint Venture must be a Certified Firm, with a share in the capital
contribution, control, management, risks, and profits of the Joint Venture which is equal to
its ownership interest.. Each Certified Firm partner must contribute property, capital, efforts,
skill and knowledge and be responsible for a distinct, clearly defined portion of the work of
the contract. Joint Ventures must have an agreement in writing specifying the terms and
conditions of the relationships between the partners and their relationship and responsibility
to the contract.
(g)
In lieu of conducting its own certifications, the CC Director by rule may
accept formal certifications by other entities as meeting the requirements of the Program, if
the CC Director determines that the certification standards of such entities are comparable

124

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 14, 2011
to those of the County.
(h)
The certification status of all MBEs and WBEs shall be reviewed
periodically by the Office of Contract Compliance. Failure of the firm to seek recertification
by filing the necessary documentation with the CC Director as provided by rule may result
in decertification.
(i)
It is the responsibility of the Certified Firm to notify the CC Director of any
change in its circumstances affecting its continued eligibility for the Program, including
decertification by another agency. Failure to do so may result in the firm's decertification.
(j)
The CC Director shall decertify a firm that does not continuously meet the
eligibility criteria.
(k)
Decertification by another agency shall create a prima facie case for
decertification by the County. The challenged firm shall have the burden of proving that its
County certification should be maintained.
(l)
A firm that has been denied certification or recertification or has been
decertified may protest the denial or decertification as provided by rule.
(m)
A firm found to be ineligible may not apply for certification for six (6)
months after the effective date of the final decision.
(n)
A third party may challenge the eligibility of an applicant for certification
or a Certified Firm as provided by rule. Such challenges shall be signed and sworn by the
individual challenging the eligibility of an applicant for certification or a certified form. The
burden of proof shall rest with the complainant. Such challenges to eligibility shall be
subject to an appeal. The CC Director shall be the final arbiter of all challenges. The
presumption that the challenged firm is eligible shall remain in effect until the County CC
Director renders a final decision.
Sec. 34-296. Annual aspirational goals.
The Annual Aspirational Goals for the utilization of MBEs and WBEs on County
construction contracts and subcontracts shall be 24 percent for MBEs and four (4) ten (10)
percent for WBEs.
Sec. 34-297. Project specific goals.
The CC Director, in consultation with the User Department, shall establish Project
Specific Goals for construction Contracts based upon the availability of at least three MBEs
and three WBEs to perform the anticipated subcontracting functions of the project and the
County's utilization of MBEs and WBEs to date.
Sec. 34-298. Counting MBE and WBE participation.
(a)
The entire amount of that portion of a contract that is performed by the
MBEs or WBEs own forces shall be counted, including the cost of supplies and materials
obtained by the MBE or WBE for the work of the contract, and supplies purchased or
equipment leased by the MBE or WBE (except supplies and equipment the MBE or WBE
purchases or leases from the prime Contractor or the prime Contractor's Affiliate).

125

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 14, 2011

(b)
The entire amount of fees or commissions charged by a MBE or WBE for
providing a bona fide service, such as professional, technical, consultant or managerial
services, or for providing bonds or insurance specifically required for the performance of a
contract, shall be counted, provided the fee is reasonable and not excessive as compared
with fees customarily charged for similar services.
(c)
When a MBE or WBE performs as a participant in a Joint Venture, only the
portion of the total dollar value of the contract equal to the distinct, clearly defined portion
of the work of the Joint Venture's contract that is performed by the MBE or WBE with its
own forces and for which it is separately at risk, shall be counted.
(d)
Only expenditures to a MBE or WBE that is performing a Commercially
Useful Function shall be counted. To determine whether a MBE or WBE is performing a
Commercially Useful Function, the County will evaluate the amount of work subcontracted,
industry practices, whether the amount the MBE or WBE is to be paid under the contract is
commensurate with the work it is actually performing and other relevant factors. To perform
a Commercially Useful Function, the MBE or WBE must be responsible, with respect to
materials and supplies used on the contract, for negotiating price, determining quality and
quantity, ordering the material, installing (where applicable) and paying for the material
itself. A MBE or WBE does not perform a Commercially Useful Function if its role is
limited to that of an extra participant in the contract through which funds are passed in order
to obtain the appearance of MBE or WBE participation. If a MBE or WBE subcontracts a
greater portion of the work of a contract than would be expected based on normal industry
practice, it is presumed not to perform a Commercially Useful Function. When a MBE or
WBE is presumed not to be performing a Commercially Useful Function, the Certified Firm
may present evidence to rebut this presumption.
(e)
One hundred percent of the cost of the materials or supplies obtained from a
MBE or WBE Manufacturer or Regular Dealer shall be counted. One hundred percent of the
fees or transportation charges for the delivery of materials or supplies required on a job site
shall be counted only if the payment of such fees is a customary industry practice and are
commensurate with fees customarily charged for similar services.
(f)
If a firm ceases to be a certified Certified Firm for any other reason than
graduation from the M/WBE Construction Program during its performance on a contract,
the dollar value of work performed under a contract with that firm after it has ceased to be
certified shall not be counted.
(g)
In determining achievement of Project Specific Goals, the participation of a
MBE or WBE shall not be counted until that amount has been paid to the MBE or WBE.
Sec. 34-299. Contract pre-award compliance procedures.
(a)
For all solicitations, the bidder/proposer shall submit a Utilization Plan
detailing all subcontractors from which the Contractor solicited bids or quotations, and if
Project Specific Goals have been established, its achievement of the Goals or its Good Faith
Efforts to do so. The Utilization Plan shall be due at the time the bid / proposal is due.
(b)
Any agreement between a Contractor and a MBE or WBE in which the
Contractor requires that the MBE or WBE not provide subcontracting quotations to other

126

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 14, 2011
Contractors is prohibited.
(c)
Where the Contractor cannot achieve the Project Specific Goal(s), the CC
Director will determine whether the Contractor has made Good Faith Efforts to meet the
Goal(s). In making this determination, the CC Director will consider, at a minimum, the
Contractor's efforts to:
(1)

Solicit through all reasonable and available means (e.g., attendance at prebid meetings, advertising and written notices) the interest of all MBEs and
WBEs certified in the scopes of work of the contract. The Contractor shall
provide interested MBEs and WBEs with timely, adequate information
about the plans, specifications, and requirements of the contract to allow
MBEs and WBEs to respond to the solicitation. The Contractor must follow
up initial solicitations with interested MBEs and WBEs.

(2)

Select portions of the work to be performed by MBEs and WBEs in order to
increase the likelihood that the Project Specific Goals will be achieved.
This includes, where appropriate, breaking out contract work items into
economically feasible units to facilitate MBE and WBE participation, even
when the Contractor would otherwise prefer to perform these work items
with its own forces. It is the Contractor's responsibility to make a portion of
the work available to MBEs and WBEs and to select those portions of the
work or material needs consistent with the availability MBEs and WBEs to
facilitate their participation.

(3)

Negotiate in good faith with interested MBEs and WBEs. Evidence of such
negotiation includes the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of MBEs
and WBEs that were contacted; a description of the information provided
regarding the plans and specifications for the work selected for
subcontracting; and why agreements could not be reached with MBEs and
WBEs. The Contractor may not reject MBEs and WBEs as being
unqualified without sound reasons based on a thorough investigation of
their capabilities. That there may be some additional costs involved in
finding and using MBEs and WBEs is not in itself sufficient reason for a
Contractor's failure to meet the Project Specific Goals, as long as such costs
are reasonable. The ability or desire of a Contractor to perform the work of
a contract with its own organization does not relieve it of the responsibility
to make Good Faith Efforts on all subcontractable scopes of work that
could be subcontracted.

(4)

Make efforts to assist interested MBEs and WBEs in obtaining bonding,
lines of credit, or insurance as required by the County or the prime
Contractor, where appropriate.

(5)

Make efforts to assist interested MBEs and WBEs in obtaining necessary
equipment, supplies, materials, or related assistance or services, where
appropriate.

(6)

Use the services of the Office of Contract Compliance, available
minority/women community organizations, minority/women contractors'
groups, government sponsored minority/women business assistance offices

and other appropriate organizations to provide assistance in the recruitment
and placement of MBEs and WBEs.
(e)
In determining whether a Contractor has made Good Faith Efforts, the
performance of other Contractors in meeting the Project Specific Goals may be considered.
For example, when the apparent successful Contractor fails to meet the Project Specific
Goals but others meet it, it may be reasonably questioned whether, with additional
reasonable efforts, the apparent successful Contractor could have met the Project Specific
Goals. Similarly, if the apparent successful Contractor fails to meet the Project Specific
Goals, but meets or exceeds the average MBE or WBE participation obtained by other
Contractors, this may be evidence that the apparent successful Contractor made Good Faith
Efforts.
(f)
A signed letter of intent from each listed MBE or WBE, describing the
work, materials, equipment or services to be performed or provided by the MBE or WBE
and the agreed upon dollar value shall be due at the time of bid proposal or within three
days after such submission.
(g)
The CC Director shall timely review the Utilization Plan before award,
including the scope of work and the letters of intent from MBEs and WBEs. The CC
Director may request clarification in writing of items listed in the Utilization Plan, provided
such clarification shall not include the opportunity to augment listed participation or Good
Faith Efforts.
(h)
If the CC Director determines that the Utilization Plan demonstrates that the
Project Specific Goals have been achieved or Good Faith Efforts made, with the
concurrence of the User Department, the CC Director and User Department shall
recommend award to Purchasing Agent Department.
(i)

Faith Efforts, the CC Director shall communicate this finding to the User Purchasing
Department and recommend that the bid/proposal be rejected. A Contractor may protest this
determination pursuant to the County's bid protest procedures.
Sec. 34-300. Contract administration procedures.
(a)
Upon award of a contract by the County that includes Project Specific
Goals, the Project Specific Goals become covenants of performance by the Contractors in
favor of the County and incorporated in the contract.
(b)
The Contractor shall provide a listing of all subcontractors to be used in the

course of the contract. The County shall have full and timely access to the Contractor's
books and records, including without limitation payroll records, tax returns and records and
books of account, to determine the Contractor's compliance with its commitment to MBE
and WBE participation and the status of any MBE or WBE performing any portion of the
contract. This provision shall be in addition to, and not a substitute for, any other provision
allowing inspection of the Contractor's records by any officer or official of the County for
any purpose.

128

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 14, 2011

(c)

MBEs or WBEs named in the Utilization Plan without the prior written approval of the CC

a substituted subcontractor to begin work until both the Director,
Purchasing Agent and the User Department have approved the substitution.

(2)

The facts supporting the request must not have been known nor reasonably
should have been known by either party before the submission of the
Utilization Plan. Bid shopping is prohibited. The Contractor must negotiate
with the MBE or WBE subcontractor to resolve the problem. Where there
has been a mistake or disagreement about the scope of work, the MBE or
WBE can be substituted only where an agreement cannot be reached for a
reasonable price for the correct scope of work.

(3)

(iii)

Financial incapacity.

(iv)

Refusal by the subcontractor to honor the bid or proposal price.

(v)

Mistake of fact or law about the elements of the scope of work of a
solicitation where agreement upon a reasonable price cannot be

(vi)

Failure of the subcontractor to meet insurance, licensing or bonding
requirements; or

(vii)

The subcontractor's withdrawal of its bid or proposal.

substitution, and the basis of any denial, shall be communicated to the
parties in writing by the CC Director.

129

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 14, 2011
(5)

Where the Contractor has established the basis for the substitution to the
satisfaction of the County, the Contractor shall make Good Faith Efforts to

Project Specific Goal(s) cannot be reached and Good Faith Efforts have
been made, the Contractor may substitute with a non-Certified Firm.

(6)

If the County requires the substitution of a MBE or WBE subcontractor
listed in the Utilization Plan, the Contractor shall undertake Good Faith

WBE subcontractor. If the Goal(s) cannot be reached and Good Faith
Efforts have been made, the Contractor may substitute with a non-Certified
Firm.

(d)
If a Contractor plans to hire a subcontractor on any scope of work that was
not previously disclosed in the Utilization Plan, the Contractor shall obtain the approval of
the CC Director to modify the Utilization Plan and must make Good Faith Efforts to ensure
that MBES and WBEs have a fair opportunity to bid on the new scope of work.
(e)
Changes to the scopes of work shall be documented by the User
Department at the time they arise to establish the reasons for the change and the effect on
achievement of the MBE or WBE goal.
(f)
Prior to contract closeout, the CC Director shall evaluate the Contractor's
fulfillment of the contracted goals, taking into account all approved substitutions,
terminations and changes to the contract's scope of work. If the County determines that

Economically Disadvantaged. Such delegations of authority must be revocable, and the
Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) must retain the power to hire and fire
any such person. The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) must actually
exercise control over the firm's operations, work, management and policy.

(4)

The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) must have an overall
understanding of, and managerial and technical competence, experience and Expertise,
directly related to the firm's operations and work. The Socially and Economically
Disadvantaged owner(s) must have the ability to intelligently and critically evaluate
information presented by other participants in the firm's activities and to make
independent decisions concerning the firm's daily operations, work, management, and
policymaking.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 14, 2011

(5)

If federal, state and/or local laws, regulations or statutes require the owner(s) to have a
particular license or other credential to own and/or control a certain type of firm, then the
Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) must possess the required license or
credential. If state law, County ordinance or other law regulations or statute does not
require that the owner posses the license or credential, that the owner(s) lacks such
license or credential is a factor, but is not dispositive, in determining whether the Socially
and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) actually controls the firm.

(6)

A Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner cannot engage in outside
employment or other business interests that conflict with the management of the firm or
prevent the owner from devoting sufficient time and attention to the affairs of the firm to
manage and control its day to day activities.

(d)
Only an independent firm may be certified as a MBE or WBE. An independent firm is
one whose viability does not depend on its relationship with another firm. Recognition of an applicant as
a separate entity for tax or corporate purposes is not necessarily sufficient to demonstrate that a firm is
independent and non-Affiliated. In determining whether an applicant is an independent business Business,
the CC Director will:
(1)

Scrutinize relationships with non-Certified Firms in such areas as personnel, facilities,
equipment, financial and/or bonding support, and other resources.

(2)

Consider whether present or recent employer/employee relationships between the
Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) of the applicant and non-Certified
Firms or persons associated with non-Certified Firms compromise the applicant's
independence.

(3)

Examine the applicant's relationships with non-Certified Firms to determine whether a
pattern of exclusive or primary dealings with non-Certified Firm compromises the
applicant's independence.

(4)

Consider the consistency of relationships between the applicant and non-Certified Firms
with normal industry practice.

(e)
An applicant shall be certified only for specific types of work in which the Socially and
Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) has the ability and Expertise to manage and control the firm's
operations and work.
(f)
The County shall certify the eligibility of Joint Ventures involving MBEs or WBEs and
non-Certified Firms. To be considered an eligible Joint Venture, at least one partner of the Joint Venture
must be a Certified Firm, with a share in the capital contribution, control, management, risks, and profits
of the Joint Venture which is equal to its ownership interest.. Each Certified Firm partner must contribute
property, capital, efforts, skill and knowledge and be responsible for a distinct, clearly defined portion of
the work of the contract. Joint Ventures must have an agreement in writing specifying the terms and
conditions of the relationships between the partners and their relationship and responsibility to the
contract.
(g)
In lieu of conducting its own certifications, the CC Director by rule may accept formal
certifications by other entities as meeting the requirements of the Program, if the CC Director determines
that the certification standards of such entities are comparable to those of the County.

140

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 14, 2011

(h)
The certification status of all MBEs and WBEs shall be reviewed periodically by the
Office of Contract Compliance. Failure of the firm to seek recertification by filing the necessary
documentation with the CC Director as provided by rule may result in decertification.
(i)
It is the responsibility of the Certified Firm to notify the CC Director of any change in its
circumstances affecting its continued eligibility for the Program, including decertification by another
agency. Failure to do so may result in the firm's decertification.
(j)

The CC Director shall decertify a firm that does not continuously meet the eligibility

criteria.
(k)
Decertification by another agency shall create a prima facie case for decertification by
the County. The challenged firm shall have the burden of proving that its County certification should be
maintained.
(l)
A firm that has been denied certification or recertification or has been decertified may
protest the denial or decertification as provided by rule.
(m)
A firm found to be ineligible may not apply for certification for six (6) months after the
effective date of the final decision.
(n)
A third party may challenge the eligibility of an applicant for certification or a Certified
Firm as provided by rule. Such challenges shall be signed and sworn by the individual challenging the
eligibility of an applicant for certification or a certified form. The burden of proof shall rest with the
complainant. Such challenges to eligibility shall be subject to an appeal. The CC Director shall be the
final arbiter of all challenges. The presumption that the challenged firm is eligible shall remain in effect
until the County CC Director renders a final decision.
Sec. 34-296.

Annual aspirational goals.

The Annual Aspirational Goals for the utilization of MBEs and WBEs on County construction
contracts and subcontracts shall be 24 percent for MBEs and four (4) ten (10) percent for WBEs.
Sec. 34-297.

Project specific goals.

The CC Director, in consultation with the User Department, shall establish Project Specific Goals
for construction Contracts based upon the availability of at least three MBEs and three WBEs to perform
the anticipated subcontracting functions of the project and the County's utilization of MBEs and WBEs to
date.
Sec. 34-298.

Counting MBE and WBE participation.

(a)
The entire amount of that portion of a contract that is performed by the MBEs or WBEs
own forces shall be counted, including the cost of supplies and materials obtained by the MBE or WBE
for the work of the contract, and supplies purchased or equipment leased by the MBE or WBE (except
supplies and equipment the MBE or WBE purchases or leases from the prime Contractor or the prime
Contractor's Affiliate).
(b)
The entire amount of fees or commissions charged by a MBE or WBE for providing a
bona fide service, such as professional, technical, consultant or managerial services, or for providing

141

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 14, 2011
bonds or insurance specifically required for the performance of a contract, shall be counted, provided the
fee is reasonable and not excessive as compared with fees customarily charged for similar services.
(c)
When a MBE or WBE performs as a participant in a Joint Venture, only the portion of
the total dollar value of the contract equal to the distinct, clearly defined portion of the work of the Joint
Venture's contract that is performed by the MBE or WBE with its own forces and for which it is
separately at risk, shall be counted.
(d)
Only expenditures to a MBE or WBE that is performing a Commercially Useful Function
shall be counted. To determine whether a MBE or WBE is performing a Commercially Useful Function,
the County will evaluate the amount of work subcontracted, industry practices, whether the amount the
MBE or WBE is to be paid under the contract is commensurate with the work it is actually performing
and other relevant factors. To perform a Commercially Useful Function, the MBE or WBE must be
responsible, with respect to materials and supplies used on the contract, for negotiating price, determining
quality and quantity, ordering the material, installing (where applicable) and paying for the material itself.
A MBE or WBE does not perform a Commercially Useful Function if its role is limited to that of an extra
participant in the contract through which funds are passed in order to obtain the appearance of MBE or
WBE participation. If a MBE or WBE subcontracts a greater portion of the work of a contract than would
be expected based on normal industry practice, it is presumed not to perform a Commercially Useful
Function. When a MBE or WBE is presumed not to be performing a Commercially Useful Function, the
Certified Firm may present evidence to rebut this presumption.
(e)
One hundred percent of the cost of the materials or supplies obtained from a MBE or
WBE Manufacturer or Regular Dealer shall be counted. One hundred percent of the fees or transportation
charges for the delivery of materials or supplies required on a job site shall be counted only if the
payment of such fees is a customary industry practice and are commensurate with fees customarily
charged for similar services.
(f)
If a firm ceases to be a certified Certified Firm for any other reason than graduation from
the M/WBE Construction Program during its performance on a contract, the dollar value of work
performed under a contract with that firm after it has ceased to be certified shall not be counted.
(g)
In determining achievement of Project Specific Goals, the participation of a MBE or
WBE shall not be counted until that amount has been paid to the MBE or WBE.
Sec. 34-299.

Contract pre-award compliance procedures.

(a)
For all solicitations, the bidder/proposer shall submit a Utilization Plan detailing all
subcontractors from which the Contractor solicited bids or quotations, and if Project Specific Goals have
been established, its achievement of the Goals or its Good Faith Efforts to do so. The Utilization Plan
shall be due at the time the bid / proposal is due.
(b)
Any agreement between a Contractor and a MBE or WBE in which the Contractor
requires that the MBE or WBE not provide subcontracting quotations to other Contractors is prohibited.
(c)
Where the Contractor cannot achieve the Project Specific Goal(s), the CC Director will
determine whether the Contractor has made Good Faith Efforts to meet the Goal(s). In making this
determination, the CC Director will consider, at a minimum, the Contractor's efforts to:
(1)

Solicit through all reasonable and available means (e.g., attendance at pre-bid meetings,
advertising and written notices) the interest of all MBEs and WBEs certified in the scopes

142

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 14, 2011
of work of the contract. The Contractor shall provide interested MBEs and WBEs with
timely, adequate information about the plans, specifications, and requirements of the
contract to allow MBEs and WBEs to respond to the solicitation. The Contractor must
follow up initial solicitations with interested MBEs and WBEs.
(2)

Select portions of the work to be performed by MBEs and WBEs in order to increase the
likelihood that the Project Specific Goals will be achieved. This includes, where
appropriate, breaking out contract work items into economically feasible units to
facilitate MBE and WBE participation, even when the Contractor would otherwise prefer
to perform these work items with its own forces. It is the Contractor's responsibility to
make a portion of the work available to MBEs and WBEs and to select those portions of
the work or material needs consistent with the availability MBEs and WBEs to facilitate
their participation.

(3)

Negotiate in good faith with interested MBEs and WBEs. Evidence of such negotiation
includes the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of MBEs and WBEs that were
contacted; a description of the information provided regarding the plans and
specifications for the work selected for subcontracting; and why agreements could not be
reached with MBEs and WBEs. The Contractor may not reject MBEs and WBEs as being
unqualified without sound reasons based on a thorough investigation of their capabilities.
That there may be some additional costs involved in finding and using MBEs and WBEs
is not in itself sufficient reason for a Contractor's failure to meet the Project Specific
Goals, as long as such costs are reasonable. The ability or desire of a Contractor to
perform the work of a contract with its own organization does not relieve it of the
responsibility to make Good Faith Efforts on all subcontractable scopes of work that
could be subcontracted.

(4)

Make efforts to assist interested MBEs and WBEs in obtaining bonding, lines of credit, or
insurance as required by the County or the prime Contractor, where appropriate.

(5)

Make efforts to assist interested MBEs and WBEs in obtaining necessary equipment,
supplies, materials, or related assistance or services, where appropriate.

(6)

Use the services of the Office of Contract Compliance, available minority/women
community organizations, minority/women contractors' groups, government sponsored
minority/women business assistance offices and other appropriate organizations to
provide assistance in the recruitment and placement of MBEs and WBEs.

(e)
In determining whether a Contractor has made Good Faith Efforts, the performance of
other Contractors in meeting the Project Specific Goals may be considered. For example, when the
apparent successful Contractor fails to meet the Project Specific Goals but others meet it, it may be
reasonably questioned whether, with additional reasonable efforts, the apparent successful Contractor
could have met the Project Specific Goals. Similarly, if the apparent successful Contractor fails to meet
the Project Specific Goals, but meets or exceeds the average MBE or WBE participation obtained by
other Contractors, this may be evidence that the apparent successful Contractor made Good Faith Efforts.
(f)
A signed letter of intent from each listed MBE or WBE, describing the work, materials,
equipment or services to be performed or provided by the MBE or WBE and the agreed upon dollar value
shall be due at the time of bid proposal or within three days after such submission.

143

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 14, 2011
(g)
The CC Director shall timely review the Utilization Plan before award, including the
scope of work and the letters of intent from MBEs and WBEs. The CC Director may request clarification
in writing of items listed in the Utilization Plan, provided such clarification shall not include the
opportunity to augment listed participation or Good Faith Efforts.
(h)
If the CC Director determines that the Utilization Plan demonstrates that the Project
Specific Goals have been achieved or Good Faith Efforts made, with the concurrence of the User
Department, the CC Director and User Department shall recommend award to Purchasing Agent
Department.
(i)
If the CC Director finds that a Contractor did not make sufficient Good Faith Efforts, the
CC Director shall communicate this finding to the User Purchasing Department and recommend that the
bid/proposal be rejected. A Contractor may protest this determination pursuant to the County's bid protest
procedures.
Sec. 34-300.

Contract administration procedures.

(a)
Upon award of a contract by the County that includes Project Specific Goals, the Project
Specific Goals become covenants of performance by the Contractors in favor of the County and
incorporated in the contract.
(b)
The Contractor shall provide a listing of all subcontractors to be used in the performance
of the contract, and detailed subcontractor information to the County with each request for payment
submitted to the County or as otherwise directed by the County. The CC Director and the User
Department shall monitor subcontractor participation during the course of the contract. The County shall
have full and timely access to the Contractor's books and records, including without limitation payroll
records, tax returns and records and books of account, to determine the Contractor's compliance with its
commitment to MBE and WBE participation and the status of any MBE or WBE performing any portion
of the contract. This provision shall be in addition to, and not a substitute for, any other provision
allowing inspection of the Contractor's records by any officer or official of the County for any purpose.
(c)
The Contractor cannot make changes to the Utilization Plan or substitute MBEs or WBEs
named in the Utilization Plan without the prior written approval of the CC Director, Purchasing Agent
and the User Department. Unauthorized changes or substitutions shall be a violation of this subdivision
and a breach of contract, and may constitute grounds for rejection of the bid or proposal or cause
termination of the executed contract for breach, the withholding of payment and/or subject the Contractor
to contract penalties or other sanctions.
(1)

All requests for changes or substitutions of a MBE or WBE Subcontractor(s) named in
the Utilization Plan shall be made to the CC Director, Purchasing Agent and the User
Department in writing, and shall clearly and fully set forth the basis for the request. A
Contractor shall not substitute a MBE or WBE subcontractor or perform the work
designated for a MBE or WBE subcontractor with its own forces unless and until the CC
Director, Purchasing Agent and in consultation with the User Department, approve
approves such substitution in writing. A Contractor shall not allow a substituted
subcontractor to begin work until both the Director, Purchasing Agent and the User
Department have approved the substitution.

(2)

The facts supporting the request must not have been known nor reasonably should have
been known by either party before the submission of the Utilization Plan. Bid shopping is
prohibited. The Contractor must negotiate with the MBE or WBE subcontractor to

144

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 14, 2011
resolve the problem. Where there has been a mistake or disagreement about the scope of
work, the MBE or WBE can be substituted only where an agreement cannot be reached
for a reasonable price for the correct scope of work.
(3)

Substitutions of the subcontractor shall be permitted only on the following bases:
(i)

Unavailability after receipt of reasonable notice to proceed.

(ii)

Failure of performance.

(iii)

Financial incapacity.

(iv)

Refusal by the subcontractor to honor the bid or proposal price.

(v)

Mistake of fact or law about the elements of the scope of work of a solicitation
where agreement upon a reasonable price cannot be reached.

(vi)

Failure of the subcontractor to meet insurance, licensing or bonding
requirements; or

(vii)

The subcontractor's withdrawal of its bid or proposal.

(4)

The County's final decision whether to permit or deny the proposed substitution, and the
basis of any denial, shall be communicated to the parties in writing by the CC Director.

(5)

Where the Contractor has established the basis for the substitution to the satisfaction of
the County, the Contractor shall make Good Faith Efforts to fulfill the Utilization Plan.
The Contractor may seek the assistance of the Office of Contract Compliance in
obtaining a new MBE or WBE. If the Project Specific Goal(s) cannot be reached and
Good Faith Efforts have been made, the Contractor may substitute with a non-Certified
Firm.

(6)

If the County requires the substitution of a MBE or WBE subcontractor listed in the
Utilization Plan, the Contractor shall undertake Good Faith Efforts to fulfill the
Utilization Plan. The Contractor may seek the assistance of the Office of Contract
Compliance in obtaining a new MBE or WBE subcontractor. If the Goal(s) cannot be
reached and Good Faith Efforts have been made, the Contractor may substitute with a
non-Certified Firm.

(d)
If a Contractor plans to hire a subcontractor on any scope of work that was not previously
disclosed in the Utilization Plan, the Contractor shall obtain the approval of the CC Director to modify the
Utilization Plan and must make Good Faith Efforts to ensure that MBES and WBEs have a fair
opportunity to bid on the new scope of work.
(e)
Changes to the scopes of work shall be documented by the User Department at the time
they arise to establish the reasons for the change and the effect on achievement of the MBE or WBE goal.
(f)
Prior to contract closeout, the CC Director shall evaluate the Contractor's fulfillment of
the contracted goals, taking into account all approved substitutions, terminations and changes to the
contract's scope of work. If the County determines that Good Faith Efforts to meet the MBE or WBE
commitments were not made, or that fraudulent misrepresentations have been made, or any other breach

145

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 14, 2011
of the contract or violation of this subdivision, a remedy or sanction may be imposed, as provided in the
contract.

PROPOSED CONTRACT AMENDMENT

Transmitting a Communication, dated May 24, 2011 from
THOMAS J. DART, Sheriff of Cook County
by
ALEXIS HERRERA, Chief Financial Officer, Cook County Sheriff's Office
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to amend and increase by $ 25,390,722.00 and extend
for two (2) years, Contract No. 08-84-387 REBID Sections I and II, with Aramark Correctional Services,
LLC., Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for Food Service for Inmate Meals.
Board approved amount 05/05/09:
Previous Increase Approved 10/05/10 (CPI Adjustment)
Increase Requested Section I & II:
Adjusted amount:
Reason:

$25,787,690.56
$140,022.00
$25,390,722.00
$ 51,318,434.56

The original terms of this contract was initially for two years with two one year extension
options. Aramark has agreed to waive the contractually allowed increase based upon the
Consumer Price Index variation, if the County agrees to extend this contract for a two
year period instead of two separate one year extensions. This will result in a cost savings
to the County of approximately $140,000.
In conjunction with the renewal period the Sheriff’s Office began a process to review and
renegotiate the terms of contract #08-84-387 Rebid with Aramark Correctional Services.
The Sheriff’s Office and the vendor have come to the following terms; Aramark has
agreed to reduce the price per meal for breakfast, lunch, and dinner meals at the CCDOC
and DCSI. This has been achieved through the reduction in average calories per day
from 2700 to 2300. This will result in a cost savings to the County of approximately
$700,000 over the next two years. The meal plan conforms with the Illinois Jail Acts and
Regulations. This new meal plan is also a healthier alternative to the previous meal plan.
With the assistance of the State's Attorney an amendment has been drafted to reflect these
terms.
The total overall savings for the two year period is approximately $840,000.00. The
expiration date of the current contract is June 27, 2011.

LETTER REGARDING OVERSTATEMENT OF REVENUE
IN THE 2009 COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT
Transmitting a Communication, dated May 16, 2011 from
TARIQ G. MALHANCE, Chief Financial Officer
and
CONSTANCE M. KRAVITZ, CPA, Cook County Comptroller
RE: Overstatement of Revenue in the 2009 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report
In May 2011, the financial management team of The County of Cook, Illinois (the “County”) identified,
in connection with the on-going fiscal 2010 external audit process, that revenues had been erroneously
reported in fiscal year 2009 on the modified accrual basis of accounting in the general fund financial
statements, and on the full accrual basis of accounting in the government-wide financial statements. The
County financial management team determined that the errors were primarily the result of improper
journal entries recorded during the fiscal year 2009 financial closing process which resulted in (i) the
double-recording of certain non-property tax revenues, primarily including State of Illinois sales taxes,
and (ii) the over-accrual of revenues that should have been attributed to December 2009 (fiscal year 2010)
from certain taxes imposed by the County under its home rule powers (i.e. cigarette tax) and/or from fee
office charges. In the general fund, the combined result of the errors was to overstate County assets and
revenues on the modified accrual basis of accounting by approximately $90 million. The governmentwide financial statements on the full accrual basis of accounting were misstated by approximately $55
million. As restated, the general fund balance for fiscal year 2009 is approximately $100 million.
In consultation with the President’s Office, the Chairman of the Audit Committee of the Cook County
Board of Commissioners and its independent auditors, the County’s financial management team has
determined to restate the beginning fund balance for the general fund and the beginning net deficit for the
governmental activities of the government-wide financial statements in its fiscal 2010 basic financial
statements.
The County has appointed a new Director of Financial Reporting, effective June 6, 2011, to ensure that
proper financial closing and reporting policies, procedures, and internal controls (specifically journal
entry recording and authorization controls) will be implemented to mitigate the future risk of material
misstatement.
The financial management team has concluded that these errors are material to the previously issued basic
financial statements and auditor’s report thereon; accordingly, the County has removed the 2009 basic
financial statements and auditor’s report thereon from its website and disseminated this statement by (i)
delivering it to the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board through its Electronic Municipal Market
Access System for municipal securities (ii) posting it to the Cook County website and (iii) submitting it
to the U.S. Federal Audit Clearinghouse.
_________________________
In accordance with Cook County Code Section 2-108(z)(1) Amendment or suspension of rules,
Commissioner Daley, seconded by Commissioner Silvestri, moved to suspend Section 2-108(h)(1) Prior

COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT PROGRAM
Transmitting a Communication, dated May 23, 2011 from
HERMAN BREWER, Director, Office of Capital Planning and Policy
Transmitted herewith are the recommended projects for the 2011 Community Development Block Grant
Program (CDBG), the Emergency Shelter Grant Program (ESG), and the proposed use of funds under the
HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME). The Cook County Community Development
Advisory Council (CDAC) adopted these recommendations at a public hearing held on May 19, 2011.
The amount of CDBG funds requested was over $21 million. The amount of CDBG funds available for
programming is based on 2011 Program Year allocation estimates totaling $9,405,620.00. The proposed
use of CDBG funds will provide benefits to low and moderate-income persons.
The amount of ESG funds requested was over $1 million. The amount of ESG funds available for
programming, were originally based on 2011 Program Year allocation estimates totaling $600,382.00.
However, the U.S. Department of Housing and Development (HUD) has advised Grantees to assume
funding based on the 2010 allocation of $435,001.00. The proposed use of ESG funds is to provide
essential services, and maintenance/operations costs for homeless shelters in suburban Cook County, as
well as funding for homeless prevention.
The amount of HOME Investment Partnerships funds granted by HUD for the 2011 Program Year
allocation is estimated at $5,524,208.00. Applications for eligible HOME projects are accepted
throughout the year. The proposed use of all funds must be incorporated into the County’s Annual Action
Plan for submittal to HUD.
Estimated project allocations will be adjusted proportionally upon receipt of final allocations.
Prior to submitting required documents to HUD, Cook County must also publish recommended project
descriptions in the Annual Action Plan. All documents and certifications must be submitted to HUD no
later than August 15, 2011.
I respectfully request approval of the recommended proportional allocations for the CDBG and ESG
projects, the proposed use of the HOME funds, and that the Bureau Chief of Economic Development or
his/her designee be authorized to execute, on behalf of the County of Cook, any and all documents
necessary to further the programs approval herein, including, but not limited to, subrecipient agreements,
intergovernmental agreements, amendments and modifications thereto, loan documents, lien assignments,
releases of mortgages and liens, and mortgage assumptions.
