The Defendants served by the program are currently being detained in the Jail despite court orders
releasing them upon relatively low monetary bonds. The Defendants, their family members, friends,
former employees, pastors, teachers and others must be interviewed. Information received must be
verified.
This work must be done by individuals trained in motivational interviewing and administering risk
assessments, who are very familiar with court procedures. They must also understand the purpose of
advocacy, the rules of confidentiality, and the operation of an adversarial court system.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
A RESOLUTION OPPOSING EXPANSION OF FEDERAL
NON-NAVIGABLE WATERS OF THE UNITED STATES

JURISDICTION

OVER

WHEREAS, Cook County includes numerous navigable waters, including the Chicago River, Calumet
River, Des Plaines River and the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal; and
WHEREAS, we recognize the critical importance of protecting the quality of surface water resources for
the protection of health, public safety, economic security, and the environment of the region; and
WHEREAS, we support reasonable public investments and work practices that ensure adequate protection
of water resources in the area; and
WHEREAS, the United States Army Corps of Engineers and the United States Environmental Protection
Agency on April 21, 2014 proposed in the Federal Register what is described as a clarification of the legal
definition of the term “Waters of the United States”; and
WHEREAS, the proposed rule provides that tributaries, ponds, drainage ditches, ephemeral streams, and
surface depressions which are non-navigable and only carry or hold water on an intermittent basis, are
subject to the full range of federal oversight and regulation of the United States Environmental Protection
Agency and United States Army Corps of Engineers as though they were year-round naturally flowing
streams and waters (Part 328-Definitions §328.3); and
WHEREAS, in two prior attempts to expand federal jurisdictional waters, Solid Waste Agency of Northern
Cook County v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 2011 and Rapanos v. United States, 2006, the United States
Supreme Court reaffirmed the Clean Water Act’s limit on federal jurisdiction at “navigable”; and
WHEREAS, the expansion of federal control over local activities within normally dry ditches could
significantly impact routine maintenance and repair of County infrastructure, including the installation of
signs and culverts, removal of storm debris, cleaning of ditches, mowing, and chemical treatments to
remove unsightly vegetation along roads; and
WHEREAS, the proposed rule would be an unfunded federal mandate and could significantly increase the
cost to the County and its citizens without any additional compensation; and
WHEREAS, the proposed rule would require expensive, time-consuming federal permits in order to
develop private or government property near bodies of water, not just those which are navigable; and

Page 7 of 133

 Board of Commissioners

BOARD AGENDA

November 19, 2014

WHEREAS, the proposed rule would give federal agencies de-facto zoning authority and thus would
override the zoning authority granted to the County by the State of Illinois, and
WHEREAS, the urgency and seriousness of the proposed rule cannot be overstated.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners hereby urge
the United States Army Corps of Engineers and the United States Environmental Protection Agency to
withdraw the proposed rule of April 21, 2014; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that on behalf of the Board of Commissioners, the Secretary to the Board
shall prepare and deliver a suitable copy of this Resolution to the Administrator of the United States
Environmental Protection Agency, the Commanding General of the United States Army Corps of
Engineers, United States Senators Dick Durbin and Mark Kirk, and each Member of the Cook County
Congressional delegation.

WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners and the Committee on Finance of the Board of
Commissioners of Cook County, Illinois, have considered the subject of the Annual Tax Levy for the Fiscal

adopted; and
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of Cook County, Illinois, approved, passed, and adopted the
Annual Appropriation Bill of the County of Cook, for its Fiscal Year 2015, which said Appropriation Bill is
hereinafter set forth and which contains a Revenue Estimate that includes an allocation of the Fiscal Year

collected from the Annual Tax Levy for the Fiscal Year A.D. 2015 of the County of Cook for the Corporate

Office of Capital Planning and Policy

Summary: The Office of Capital Planning and Policy, as authorized by the Cook County Chief
Procurement Officer, plans to participate in the Cook County’s Job Order Contract (JOC) program to
complete the four (4) capital projects listed below. JOC is a quantity based procurement process that
allows facility owners to complete a multitude of repair/maintenance and construction projects with a
single, competitively bid contract. The JOC process generally involves first selecting a pool of potential
contractors through a competitive procurement process, and then identifying projects for such selected
contractors.

Page 65 of 133

 Board of Commissioners

BOARD AGENDA

November 19, 2014

The County has already completed a JOC competitive procurement process, and it has created the pool of
general contractors to perform certain projects generally associated with maintenance, repairs, replacement
and routine work.
The JOC program has an administrative component managed by the Gordian Group. The Gordian Group
maintains an area price book, which captures the prices for specific construction work items within this
region. JOC contractors bid against the prices included in the price book. The cost, therefore, of any
work performed by the contractor is a contractor markup form the price book. The Gordian Group will
manage the JOC process and will verify that all proposals and work are compliant with the terms and
conditions outlined in the JOC contract with the County.
The Office of Capital Planning and Policy, proposes to assigns the projects listed below to the Gordian
Group to share with participating JOC contractors.
Project Descriptions:
1. DOC Central Kitchen Kettle Platform – This project will consist of building a platform to
allow safe access to the kettles and the controllers. The project will include a pan ramp system
as well as the platform to support the kettle operation.
2. DOC Central Kitchen Steam Line Installation – This project will provide the connection to
the steam line, supply water piping, condensate piping, electrical power and stamped
engineered drawings.
3. 1900 W. Polk Street Fire & Life Safety Systems Upgrade Project – The Administration
Building at 1900 W. Polk was constructed in 1932, 17 stories tall and over 365,000 square feet.
This project will provide a new annunciator panel. Replace the fire control; monitoring
system, data gathering panels and detection devices to assure complete integrity of the system.
It will also address interior stairs for conformance with the Chicago Stairwell Ordinance.
4. Fire & Life Safety Emergency Upgrades Project – The Boot Camp complex at the DOC is
made up of 10 separate one story Army style dormitories and constructed in the late 1990’s.
This project will provide a new annunciator panel. Replace the fire control; monitoring
system, data gathering panels and detection devices to assure complete integrity of the system.

PROPOSED GRANT AWARD
Department: Office of Capital Planning and Policy
Grantee: County of Cook
Grantor: Illinois Clean Energy Community Foundation
Request: Authorization to accept grant
Purpose: Solar Thermal Installation
Grant Amount: $63,936.00
Grant Period: 5/1/2013 - 7/31/2014
Fiscal Impact: N/A
Accounts: N/A
Concurrences: The Budget Department has received all requisite documents and determined the fiscal
impact on Cook County, if any.
Summary: A grant in the amount of $63,936 was awarded to County of Cook to install a solar thermal
system at the Vocational Rehabilitation Impact Center (aka Bootcamp) at the Department of Corrections
(DOC) Complex. The renewable energy project is part of a campus wide energy efficiency improvement
project via energy savings performance contract between Cook County Office of Capital Planning and
NORESCO at the Department of Corrections 26th and California Street Complex. The grant funds were
used to install sixteen (16) A.E.T solar collectors (640 sq. ft.) and associated equipment and offset part of
the need for natural gas. The funds allowed the County to decrease the 51 year payback to a more
reasonable 19 years and own its second renewable energy project. The solar hot water system
supplemented the other energy conservation measures implemented to achieve a 20% reduction in annual
utility use campus wide. The solar panels were installed and commissioned on July 3, and the remaining
associated equipment (fencing, meter) and close out was completed 7/17/2014. Training of facility
engineers was completed on 8/21/2014.

Total Amount of Transfer: $118,331.00
On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
10/14/2014. The balance on that date was $19,859.00 and 30 days prior the balance in the account was
$45,324.85
How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
The source account is used for External printing (240). The increased effort to use the Cook County
Print Shop has reduced the load on this account and shifted it to the Internal Printing Account (241)
Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from.
None.
If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
Projects which were to be completed by outside vendors using the External printing budget were instead
completed internally by the Cook County Print Shop. Therefore, the resulting surplus in the source
account (241) is directly related to the deficit in the transfer account (241).
