operations per day. General Aviation followed with 174 operations per day 7 of
which were helicopters.
Ms. Contreras noted that Frontier shows zero operations and that is due to the
moving of their operations to O’Hare.
Permanent Noise Monitor Locations
The report indicates the addresses of the 12 noise monitor locations near the
airport as reflected in relation to the Midway 2018 Noise Contour. The report
shows the results for April 2015 through June 2015 with quarterly breakdowns
and a 12 month rolling average. The 2nd quarter 2015 results are compared to
those of the 2nd quarter of 2014. As of last quarter, the report includes the ward
boundaries.
Noise Hotline Report
The total number of complaints for the 2nd quarter was 4,844, which was a
notable increase from the 1st quarter. Of that total, 3,048 were from Chicago and
2,168 of those calls came from 3 Chicago addresses. The total nighttime
complaints were 1,421. Chairman Baliga asked if the majority of the complaints
were submitted online and Ms. Contreras confirmed that 95% of them were.
B. Long-Term Portable Noise Monitor Report
Mr. Frame discussed the placement of the first of two long-term portable
monitors. This quarter the southwest monitor was deployed at Reavis High
School in Burbank. The June data indicated a measured value of 55.2 DNL.
The distance of that monitor to the center of the airport is 2.5 miles and 2 miles to
the edge of the runway. The monitor will remain at the Burbank location until the
end of August 2015.
Mr. Lihosit asked what the DNL level is for school qualification. Mr. Frame
responded that the level is 60 DNL.
Mr. Frame stated that as soon as the other monitor is installed in the southeast
quadrant he will report the results.
Ms. Conwell asked for an update on the possibility that the airlines could switch
the current flight path to relieve some of the noise issues being experienced in
Burbank. Mr. Frame responded that use of the current flight procedure began in
February 2014. The situation is being evaluated, the winds are being taken into
consideration along with the number of flights occurring. The second quarter of
2014 will be compared to the 2015 second quarter. Mr. Frame will report back
with the results.
Ms. Conwell asked if there is more helicopter traffic now. Mr. Frame responded
that two privately owned heliports have opened on the south side contributing to
the increase. They are not affiliated with Midway.

Midway Noise Compatibility Commission
Mayor Klein asked if the FAA will be meeting with Midway area residents like
they are with the O’Hare residents. Mr. Frame explained that the reason for the
meeting at O’Hare is due to the use of the additional runway and the changes
incurred by that addition.
C. Status of New Permanent Noise Monitor (Site 314)
A permanent noise monitor has been installed in the northeast quadrant at 40th
and Albany. The City is currently working with ComEd on the installation of an
electric meter and once that has been completed the collection of data will begin.
Ms. Contreras also responded to Mr. Lihosit’s question regarding Site 314. She
stated that the altitude of 22L aircraft that approach over Bridgeport should be
1700 feet above ground level.
Mr. Frame informed the Commission that the CDA has launched a flight tracker
on the Midway webpage. The tracker provides on-screen access, with a twenty
minute delay, to view the aircraft arriving to and departing from Midway. He will
provide more details regarding the program at the next MNCC meeting.
CHAIRS REPORT
A. Update on Noise Abatement Programs at the Washington, DC Airports
Mr. Frame researched the questions asked at the previous meeting pertaining to
the regulating of airport operations.
In 1990 Congress passed the Airport Noise and Capacity Act that made it difficult
to restrict airport operations. Reagan Airport, in Washington DC, had a nighttime
noise rule in place since 1981 and as a result was grandfathered. Hence, the
1990 law did not apply to Reagan for that reason. For airports such as Midway
and O’Hare that were not grandfathered, the Federal government implements
regulations to administer the law which mandates that airlines continue to update
their fleet.
Chairman Baliga requested that Mr. Frame provide copies of that law for the
Commission members.
Ms. Pinion asked the age of the Midway Noise Commission and Mr. Frame
stated that it began in 1996 and is currently 19 years old.
B. Residential Sound Insulation Sub-Committee Report
Ms. Conwell presented the Residential Sound Insulation Sub-committee Report
(see attached).
Chairman Baliga asked if the work is on schedule and Mr. Frame responded that
it is. This summer and fall the CDA will work on 2,000 to 2,200 homes. That
number is greater than the Program has ever done previously in a single phase.

 FINAL Minutes of the July 23, 2015, Meeting of the
Midway Noise Compatibility Commission
Chairman Baliga inquired about property inspections. He asked if an illegal
conversion was detected would only the portion in violation be dropped or the
whole unit. Mr. Frame responded that the DOB instructed that the whole building
be dropped if a unit was found with an illegal conversion.
Ms. Dulaj asked about the eligibility of a home located at 7200 S. Avers. Mr.
Frame stated that it was no longer in the Noise Contour so it would not be
eligible.
In response to Chairman Baliga’s question from last meeting about the location
of the declines, Mr. Frame provided a chart indicating the drops and no
responses. There are approximately 1,600 dwelling units in 900 buildings. The
RSIP documented 1400 no responses.
NEW BUSINESS
A. Chairman Baliga asked if there were any further questions or new business
requiring further discussion. With none, a motion to adjourn was made by Mr.
Lihosit and seconded by Ms. Conwell.
MEETING ADJOURNMENT
Chairman Baliga adjourned the meeting at 7:21 p.m. and informed those present that
the next meeting of the Midway Noise Compatibility Commission will be held on
Thursday, October 22, 2015 at 6:30 p.m. at The Mayfield, Chicago.
