MBAC 2019
Why pilot a new MBAC format?

• Goal is for council members and public to better understand successes and
challenges of each unique area of the City
• Current MBAC regions are too large for reps
• Provide more resources to MBAC reps and better define roles
Photo: Steve Vance

 Better Understand Community Areas
• Organize meeting agendas by geography
• MBAC reps present on their community areas
• CDOT to work with MBAC reps to develop a standard format
• Background, community organizations, successful/active projects,
challenges and needs
• Additional agenda items focused on particular community areas
• CDOT still to provide citywide updates
• Organize field visits open to council members and public
Photo: Steve Vance

 Formalize Community Areas

   

Draft MBAC CommunityAreas

Resources, Roles, and Responsibilities
• Advocacy Training – Active Transportation Alliance
• Facilitate regular communication between CDOT staff & MBAC reps
• Encourage communication between MBAC reps and public
• CDOT to coordinate with MBAC reps and Council Members on agenda items
• Formalize term lengths, selection process, expectations

Photo: Steve Vance

 PROPOSED CHANGES

WHY SHOULD THEY BE IMPLEMENTED?

Increase the number of Community Reps from 5 to 8 and redefine
the community areas’ boundaries.

Build stronger relationships with residents and better advocate for
their communities’ priorities and needs.

More efficient communication and engagement with Community
Reps before, during and after meetings.

Community Reps should become integral members of a cohesive
group of council members working together to address citywide
issues

New Community Reps bylaws to include roles, terms, eligibility
and nomination process.

The current Terms of Reference do not state how community reps
are selected and for how long they serve in this position.

Revise, update and approve new Terms of Reference for the
entire Council.

There is a lack of clarity in membership, participation,
commitment, and roles for all Council members.

Schedule site visits, tours, and other activities outside MBAC
meetings

Promote a more action-oriented focus for the council and
encourage active participation from members and the public.

Implement a geographic focus for each MBAC meeting

This format will provide more meaningful information, participation
and build momentum for broader efficacy.

Council members and Community Reps will collaborate in drafting
agendas for meetings and facilitating, presentations and
discussions.

Council members should advise on the priorities to be addressed
during meetings and also advise on the presentations’ topics and
presenters.
