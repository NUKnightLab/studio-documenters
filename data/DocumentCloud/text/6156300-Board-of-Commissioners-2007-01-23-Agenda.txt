PROPOSED RESOLUTION
RESOLUTION PROPOSING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A COOK COUNTY
METROPOLITAN REGIONAL HEALTHCARE NETWORK
WHEREAS, the Cook County Bureau of Health Services and its hospitals and clinics serve as the anchor
for the safety net serving the metropolitan Chicago region’s ever-increasing number of uninsured or
underinsured citizens, not only in Cook County, but also the neighboring collar counties; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Bureau of Health Services is facing a significant financial crisis, one that
is not only a challenge for Cook County, but also for the entire metropolitan Chicago region and the state
of Illinois; and
WHEREAS, this crisis is being exacerbated by the large and growing population of uninsured living
throughout the region, federal budget cuts that continue to impact the Medicaid program, and escalating
healthcare costs that continue to be as much as three times the overall rate of inflation; and
WHEREAS, approximately 1.7 million people in Illinois, or nearly 16% are uninsured, and almost onethird of the total state population younger than age 65 are uninsured; and
WHEREAS, more than 30% of Illinois’ uninsured live in Chicago and nearly 40% live in suburban Cook
and the collar counties; and
WHEREAS, the uninsured are generally less healthy, less likely to have a family physician, more likely
to postpone receiving necessary health care and seek care at a hospital emergency room, thus further
straining the health care safety net; and

RESOLUTIONS continued
ITEM #57 cont’d
WHEREAS, the problem of the uninsured is a complex problem that impacts all of our society and
requires national and state solutions; and
WHEREAS, it is no longer feasible for Cook County to provide care for the indigent population both
within and outside its borders, without considerable and increased assistance from other governments,
providers, insurers and health care stakeholders; and
WHEREAS, these and other factors will cause Cook County’s health care crisis to worsen, thereby
placing even greater strain on the Cook County Bureau of Health Services and jeopardizing access to care
for those who depend on Cook County for their health care; and
WHEREAS, these circumstances will likewise place an even greater strain on the region’s entire health
care network, which includes private hospitals, clinics and other providers that also care for the uninsured,
poor and indigent; and
WHEREAS, in the coming months there will be an opportunity to address the problem of the uninsured
as a number of proposals to expand health coverage to Illinois’ uninsured, including those recently
recommended by the Illinois Adequate Health Care Task Force and others, will be debated in the Illinois
General Assembly during the Spring 2007 legislative session.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners shall
establish a Cook County Metropolitan Regional Healthcare Network to be comprised of the Cook County
Bureau of Health Services, area hospitals, clinics, healthcare networks and associations, physicians,
businesses, insurers and others from throughout the region; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners shall hereby establish a
Subcommittee of the Health and Hospitals Committee which will be charged with the creation, oversight
and implementation of said Cook County Metropolitan Regional Healthcare Network; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the purpose of the Cook County Metropolitan Regional Healthcare
Network will be to evaluate the impact of the Bureau of Health Services’ operations on the public it
serves and other health care providers; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Metropolitan Regional Healthcare Network will
also make recommendations to the Cook County Board of Commissioners regarding the appropriate
allocation of resources necessary to ensure that Cook County’s poor and indigent populations have access
to timely and appropriate health care services.
