Report from Chief Quality Officer
A. Regulatory and Accreditation Updates
B. Metrics (Attachment #1)
Dr. Krishna Das, Chief Quality Officer, provided an update on regulatory and accreditation matters. She stated
that the long-awaited survey by representatives of The Joint Commission (TJC) for the Ambulatory operations
took place this week. It was a two (2) day survey with two (2) surveyors; they visited seven (7) primary care
clinics, as well as some of the internal clinics on the Stroger Campus. She noted that the representatives from
TJC pointed out that this was one of the first sites surveyed under their new, safer approach using a risk-based
assessment. She stated that the survey went well; there were no high-risk findings.
Dr. Das noted that that staff have started to intensify preparations for the TJC’s triennial survey at Provident
Hospital, which is expected to happen later this year.

Report from Chief Quality Officer (continued)
Dr. Das stated that representatives from the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) recently came out to
do their triennial assessment of licensing of the dialysis center. It started as a four (4) day survey; however, they
were only here for three (3) days, because there were no additional findings. The assessment went very well,
and there were only a couple of minor findings, which were easily corrected. She stated that the administration
expects to be re-licensed by IDPH for the dialysis center.
During the discussion of the metrics, Dr. Das noted that there are now only two (2) measures relating to venous
thromboembolism (VTE) prevention that are being reported; it is no longer required to report on issues
associated to treatment. Director Driscoll inquired whether the list of the measures for which CCHHS sends
data to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and the Illinois Department of Healthcare and
Family Services can be provided. Dr. Das responded in the affirmative; she stated that the information is
included as a part of the quality plan, which will be presented to the Committee in the next few months.
With regard to the measure on influenza vaccinations, Chairman Gugenheim inquired whether this data relates
only to inpatients receiving the vaccination. Dr. Das stated that CMS’ definition includes all patients receiving
the vaccination, as well as those patients who were offered the vaccine and refused. Information was provided
on protocols that are in place for monitoring and documenting the offering of the vaccine, and
communication/education efforts by staff for those patients who refuse it. Director Driscoll requested that
information be provided near the end of the flu season that gives an idea of the overall number of System
patients (hospitals and Ambulatory) who were offered the vaccination and who accepted and received it.
C. Report on Patient Experience (Attachment #2)
Patty Looker, MA, FACHE, Director of Patient Experience, provided an overview of the Report on Patient
Experience. The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
The Report contained information on the following subjects:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Cornerstones of Patient Experience Improvement
Patient Experience Training Program
Training Content
Customer Service Training Statistics
Evidence-Based Strategies
Description, Opportunity and Action Plans – Four (4) Survey Areas
-Communication with Doctors
-Communication with Nurses
-Cleanliness of Hospital
-Willingness to Recommend the Hospital

Director Junge inquired whether the administration systematically engages the labor union management in this
initiative. In terms of staff engagement, sometimes it is forgotten that leadership includes union leadership;
until union leadership is engaged, it is a top down enterprise, and the organization may be missing huge areas of
understanding. She encouraged Ms. Looker to look closely at the use of union leadership. Ms. Looker stated
that one of her future goals is to have a closer collaboration with union leadership, as it is key to the kind of
objectives being sought. It is also an overall best practice, to push this all the way down to all levels of
leadership; she embraces that philosophy, but has not fully executed it yet.

III.

Report from Chief Quality Officer (continued)
With regard to training staff on challenging situations, Director Junge inquired whether security staff is being
trained in that particular area, as they have a lot of interaction in challenging situations. She has a strong
concern about the lack of a requirement that security staff be trained. Ms. Looker stated that the training
involving challenging situations comes in a range – all the way from interacting with a disgruntled patient who
yells at a clerk, to interacting with those who are threatening violence. Director Junge requested a report on
whether the security staff is being trained in the area of challenging situations, and regarding training them on
customer service. She noted that the organization could have huge liability issues if adequate training is not
being provided for that.
Director Driscoll inquired whether the data can also be compared with data from the other safety-net hospitals in
Cook County; if the data is being shown to staff, this comparison might be more meaningful for them to see.
Ms. Looker responded that this can be done.
Ms. Merryweather noted that, although CCHHS is maintaining its efforts, others are still leapfrogging ahead; a
key factor that may be missing is involvement of the patients. Models that are currently out there around patient
and family engagement include direct patient engagement in the form of patient advisory councils, quality
improvement advisory councils, and ombudsmen. Ms. Looker concurred; she indicated that engaging patients
in these efforts is considered best practice.
Director Estrada provided an example in which he was involved in a patient/family experience at another
institution that gave him greater insight into the importance of nursing as it relates to the patient experience. He
asked what this organization can do to care for and further support this group. Dr. Shannon asked Agnes
Therady, Executive Director of Nursing, to provide information on some of the initiatives relating to this
subject. Ms. Therady stated that they began using the A.I.D.E.T. (acknowledge, introduce, duration, explain,
thank) technique a couple of years ago, so customer service training was part of it. The administration is now
working to get the nurses more engaged in providing their input on improving the patient experience. A survey
was recently done that measured how satisfied and engaged the nurses are; that survey data is expected to be
shared with staff very soon. Based on the results, the approach will be unit-based – there will be a unit-based
shared governance council, where they will take the responsibility of leading the efforts.
