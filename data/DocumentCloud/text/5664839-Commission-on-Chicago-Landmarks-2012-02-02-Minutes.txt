work to single-family residence.

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. As recommended by the engineer, due to the differential settlement of the
front portion of the building and the resulting distress, the existing outer
wythe of brick on the front façade and portions of the side facades may be
dismantled and reinstalled, with the following conditions:
a) The historic common brick found on all three elevations shall be
salvaged and reinstalled to match the existing pattern and joint width.
Dimensions of the joint width shall be indicated on the permit plans.
Any new brick shall be common brick to match the existing in size,
texture, and finish, and the new mortar shall match the historic mortar
in color, profile, and type;
b) The existing historic decorative keystones shall be salvaged, with the
original profile repaired as necessary with a matching masonry patch,
and reinstalled in the same location;
c) The proposed new masonry opening and window at grade- level on the
front façade is approved, however the new lintel shall incorporate a
brick arch, not stone, and without a keystone, to match the other lintels
at grade level;
d) The two new masonry openings on the west (side) façade shall be
differentiated from the original window openings with simplified
detailing, such as using a flat- or arched-brick lintel with no decorative
keystone;

Proposed rear and 1-story with attic rooftop addition on a historic 3-story
single- family residence.
