To: To the Honorable President Toni Preckwinkle
and the Board of County Commissioners
From: Rabbi Moshe Wolf

I would like to voice my support for the proposed ordinance amendment changes to the Medical
Examiner's Of?ce. The Medical Examiner's Of?ce, under the leadership of Dr. Stephen Cina, has
taken great care to assure the indigent deceased of Cook County have been buried with dignity and
respect according to their religious beliefs. The proposed amendment provides the Of?ce with

additional means to enhance those efforts.

While the proposed amendment does allow the Medical Examiner's Of?ce the option of exploring
cremation, Dr. Cina has assured the Medical Examiner Advisory Committee that he will continue to
make every effort to be mindful of different religions principles regarding cremation and make
alternative accommodations. Accordingly, as both a member of the Medical Examiner Advisory
Committee and a leader of the Cook County religious community, I urge you to vote in favor of the

proposed ordinance amendment.

Sincerely,

Rabbi Moshe Wolf
