MS. BRENNEN:

Good evening.

As a Chicago resident and

24

fire Officer Rialmo, the killer of Quintonio

 Police Board Public Meeting - January 18, 2018

1

LeGrier and Bettie Jones.

2

On December 22nd, COPA found that

3

the act is unjustified in that a reasonable

4

officer would recognize there was no threat to

5

his life.

6

people isn't enough, Officer Rialmo is now

7

under investigation for assaulting two people

8

in a 3:00 a.m. bar fight on December 17th.

9

And having killed two innocent

I demand that you fire Officer

10

Rialmo immediately so that not one more cent of

11

our taxpayer money goes to employing this

12

violent and unstable individual.

14

PRESIDENT LIGHTFOOT:

Thank you.

MR. ELLIOT:

17

PRESIDENT LIGHTFOOT:

18

MR. ELLIOT:

Yes.

Thank you.

Next speaker,

Good evening.
Good evening.

So my question -- my statement

19

is about the ruling that was made by COP-A,

20

which you guys call COPA, on the 22nd of

21

December, where it was ruled that Officer

22

Rialmo had unjustly fired his pistol and killed

23

two Chicago residents, Quintonio LeGrier and

24

Bettie Jones, and that he lied about the
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

8

 Police Board Public Meeting - January 18, 2018

1

circumstances in which he fired his gun.

2

claimed that they were much closer than what

3

the facts show how far the actual distance

4

of -- that he was from both of those innocent

5

victims.

6

felt threatened, in imminent danger when he was

7

so many feet away from them, that you guys

8

recognized that and ruled that he unjustly

9

fired his pistol and killed those two innocent

10

He

To claim that he was threatened, he

people.

11

And then to make matters worse,

12

Officer Robert Rialmo has been paid over

13

$84,000 a year enjoying desk duty while the

14

families -- while these two families have

15

suffered immeasurably.

16

at the loss of their loved ones.

Every day they suffer

17

And for this City to allow this

18

to continue to happen -- because it's not the

19

first time that it happened, it's not the first

20

time that a police officer has killed a black

21

person or black persons and was given a

22

vacation of desk duty.

23
24

PRESIDENT LIGHTFOOT:
is up.

Mr. Elliot, your time

Can you wrap up?

MR. ELLIOT:

2

PRESIDENT LIGHTFOOT:

3

MR. ELLIOT:

4

Officer Rialmo.

5

Okay.

I'll wrap up.
Thank you.

So we demand the firing of

If anyone is here representing

6

the Police Board -- I'm sorry, the Police

7

Department -- I think you are, sir.

8

to take the message back to the Superintendent,

9

because it's on his desk that he has until

10

March to fire this officer.

11

to do that.

12
13

You need

And we expect him

Do you have opinion about that?
CHIEF OF PATROL WALLER:

I don't have an

14

opinion.

15

Superintendent, but what I will say is that

16

that case will be judged on the facts, and the

17

Superintendent is looking at that case.

18

will be judged on the facts and not in the

19

court of public opinion or any type of

20

political --

21

I am not going to speak for the

MR. ELLIOT:

Okay.

It

This Board ruled on it.

22

It wasn't a court of public opinion.

23

ruled he unjustly killed those two people.

24

PRESIDENT LIGHTFOOT:

And they

Let me clarify one

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

10

 Police Board Public Meeting - January 18, 2018

1

thing.

2

is clear.

3

Civilian Office of Police Accountability.

4

made a recommendation to the Superintendent.

5

The Superintendent has 90 days once he receives

6

it to make a determination.

7

period right now.

8

is not in front of us.

9

don't have the facts.

10

Let me clarify one thing so the record
That matter is investigated by the

13
14

We're in that

This Police Board, that case
No judgment on.

We

So I wanted to make sure

you and the public are clear about that.

11
12

They

Thank you for your comments.
MR. ELLIOT:

Are you saying you guys won't

be ruling on it?
PRESIDENT LIGHTFOOT:

The case isn't in

15

front of us yet.

16

Serious cases go to the Superintendent for his

17

decision, and that case could or may not come

18

to us.

19

That case is not in front of this Board yet.

20

The cases get investigated.

But you said that the Board had ruled.

MR. ELLIOT:

I misspoke on that.

COPA

21

ruled on it.

22

under consideration and fire Officer Rialmo

23

immediately.

24

And you got to take that ruling

PRESIDENT LIGHTFOOT:

Thank you, sir.

 Police Board Public Meeting - January 18, 2018

1

Our next speaker is Pamela Hunt.

2

MS. HUNT:

3

PRESIDENT LIGHTFOOT:

4

MS. HUNT:

5

Good evening.
Good evening.

I second what the young man

said, that that officer should be fired.

6

My concern for some of the new

7

board members, I am very upfront about and full

8

disclosure that I am saying that Rahm Emanuel

9

should resign.

That I feel that he is not

10

capable of representing the entire City of

11

Chicago.

12

are subjected to the police brutality and the

13

other who gets police service to serve and

14

protect.

And there are two Chicagos, one who

15

So my concern here today is still

16

dealing with the issue of racism and

17

discrimination.

18

I have not seen or heard any

19

policy or practice that is addressing the issue

20

of racism.

21

In addition, 1,000 new hirees,

22

officers, and I think statistics just came out

23

that there were only -- was it 14 or less than

24

20 percent hirees are black officers.
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

12

 Police Board Public Meeting - January 18, 2018

1

Now, the Be The Change campaign

2

was about trying to get more black officers

3

representative of the City so we could curtail

4

some of the discrimination, some of the police

5

brutality.

6

That has not occurred.
I made a recommendation that

7

white officers -- there should be a moratorium

8

on the hiring of white officers, not because

9

I'm anti white officers, but because when you

10

look at the CPD force, it is predominantly

11

white, it is because there were policies of

12

discrimination and racism that caused that

13

force to be all white.

14

Now in the interest of honesty,

15

to remedy that, I understand you don't want

16

quotas and set-asides, but I don't know what

17

else to do, because it's not fair to have a

18

thousand positions and still have them

19

predominately occupied by white officers.

20

Lastly, I'm going to ask, in the

21

training, what is in the training that's

22

different?

23

where the officers come from.

24

from Mount Greenwood, we had a racial incident

I'm concerned about the community
If they coming

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

13

 Police Board Public Meeting - January 18, 2018

1

there.

So I'm very concerned about that.

2

I've written, e-mailed

3

Superintendent Johnson.

I still don't have

4

sufficient answers.

5

know it permeates all of our society.

It's about racism.

And I

6

But nonetheless, it is systemic

7

here in Chicago based on the U.S. DOJ report.

8
9
10

So I'm asking what is -- can
somebody from the CPD, anybody tell me what is
being done on the issue of racism?

11

Lastly, I'm going to bring it

12

down to Rahm's Jewish upbringing, his religion.

13

Ram wouldn't allow --

14
15
16

BOARD MEMBER FOREMAN:

Excuse me, Ms. Hunt,

you are out of time.
MS. HUNT:

Rahm wouldn't allow a Jewish

17

youth be shot down and not have it addressed.

18

He would bring in the Israeli Army and any

19

other army.

20

PRESIDENT LIGHTFOOT:

21

MS. HUNT:

Your time is up.

I understand.

We want justice.

22

In 2018 we're still having to deal with this.

23

Thank you very much.

PRESIDENT LIGHTFOOT:

7

MS. TOWNSEND:

Good evening.

Madam President, I have a

8

statement that I would like to read in its

9

entirety if you will grant me that permission.

10

PRESIDENT LIGHTFOOT:

11

MS. TOWNSEND:

Please go ahead.

My name is Trina Townsend.

12

Growing up, most people knew me by my middle

13

name Kim or Eclipse.

14

From the age of 14 until I was

15

18, I was raped by a Chicago police officer

16

whose name is Kevin Glover.

17

Until I met Officer Kevin Glover,

18

I believed what my mother had always taught me,

19

that the police are nice, that the police help

20

people, to trust the police.

21

I even wanted to be a Chicago

22

police officer, just like Starsky and Hutch,

23

Charlie's Angels and the Mod Squad.

24

to serve and protect citizens of Chicago.

I wanted

15

 Police Board Public Meeting - January 18, 2018

2

But in one day, the dreams of an
innocent child were stolen.

3

In late August of 1981, my life

4

changed forever.

5

my freshman year of high school at the age of

6

14, I decided to report that I was being

7

sexually molested by my father and had been

8

sexually assaulted by three guys earlier that

9

week.

10

Right before the beginning of

Knowing Officer Glover from him

11

patrolling the neighborhood, I decided to flag

12

him down as he drove from around the corner in

13

his police car.

14

When Officer Glover stopped his

15

patrol car right off the corner of 45th and

16

LaPorte Avenue, I reported that I was being

17

molested by my dad inside of my home and had

18

been sexually assaulted by three of the guys

19

that resided on my block about a week prior.

20

When I told him what had been

21

happening, he assured me that he would take

22

care of the situation.

23
24

After a few days went by, I
didn't see Officer Glover.

Then one evening as

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

16

 Police Board Public Meeting - January 18, 2018

1

I was walking, Officer Glover pulled up and

2

told me to get into his car.

3

and opened the door for me.

4

He even got out

At first, I hesitated, thinking

5

about what my mother had always taught me, not

6

to get in the car with anyone.

7

When Officer Glover noticed that

8

I was reluctant to get into the car, he told me

9

he was taking me to the police station so I can

10

talk to his sergeant about what had happened to

11

me.

12

So I trusted him, and I got into

13

the car.

I thought that I would be okay

14

because I was with a police officer.

15

After awhile, I noticed that we

16

were headed down 47th Street towards Pulaski.

17

Officer Glover turned left at

18

Kolin and 47th Street.

19

we going, he didn't answer.

20

driving.

21

When I asked where were
He just kept

Finally, we came to a stop.

I

22

noticed that we were pulled over by what looked

23

like the back of a dock of an abandoned factory

24

by 45th and South Kolin.

 Police Board Public Meeting - January 18, 2018

When Officer Glover came around

2

to open the back passenger door on the right

3

side, he said, I've been waiting on you to get

4

a little older.

5

day.

I've been waiting for this

Now take off your pants.

6

At first I resisted and told

7

Officer Glover that I wasn't taking off my

8

pants.

9

he balled up his fist and made a gesture as if

He became very agitated.

That's when

10

he was about to punch me in the face.

11

stopped resisting.

12

I

From that day, all the way to a

13

month before my 18th birthday, Officer Kevin

14

Glover, the 8th District, sexually assaulted me

15

on a near monthly basis.

16

He was always on duty.

He was

17

always in the patrol car, always in uniform,

18

and he always took me to the same area near the

19

back docks on South Kolin and 45th Street.

20

By the summer of 1985, I couldn't

21

take it anymore.

After my birthday in July, I

22

wasn't going to continue to allow Officer

23

Glover to sexually assault me anymore.

24

to refuse to get into his police car.

I had

not.

Uniform or not.

2

The last time that Officer Kevin

3

Glover raped me was in June of 1985, right

4

before my high school graduation.

5

Officer Glover appeared to be

6

angrier than usual that day.

7

to hurry up because I had made up in my mind

8

this was going to be the last time.

9

I just wanted him

After he was done, his patrol car

10

wouldn't start up.

I started laughing, which

11

appeared to have made him more angrier than

12

what he was.

13

It was hard being in the same

14

neighborhood that Officer Glover patrolled,

15

especially after the death of my twin brother,

16

Tim, in 1989 when we were only 21 years old.

17

A few times after my 18th

18

birthday, Officer Glover still tried to get me

19

to get into the police car, but I was older.

20

learned how to be firm and resist.

21

Eventually, I had to move from my

22

parents' home just to get away from Officer

23

Glover.

24

I

Rather than be around him, I

turned to the streets.

I got involved in

2

different situations that was not conducive for

3

me.

4

became homeless, living in abandoned buildings,

I began using heroin and cocaine and

It was even times that I had to

eat out of the garbage cans, but it was either

that or Glover.

life has changed for the better.

It's been 17 years since my

I'm a mother of two young adults
and a grandmother of a five-year-old.

13

In April of 2002, I began working

14

in the social service field, helping people who

15

want to build a better life for themselves.

16

It wasn't long after that that I

17

decided to enroll in college to further my

18

education.

19

For years I felt like it was my

20

fault if Officer Glover was still sexually

21

assaulting young girls and women because I was

22

too afraid to speak up.

August, engaging in general conversation with

2

him, he informed me that Officer Glover was not

3

a partner that he wanted to work with, because

4

he noticed that he was having sexual relations

5

with young females.

6

that I needed to come forward and not be afraid

7

anymore of Officer Glover and tell my story of

8

the trauma, pain and suffering I endured as a

9

teenager.

I decided at that point

However, it wasn't until recently

10

when I believe my youngest daughter was in

11

jeopardy after she was approached by an officer

12

that apparently knew me.

13

come forth and tell my story.

14

Then I decided to

Although I am an adult, the

15

horrible memories of being sexually assaulted

16

by Officer Kevin Glover has caused me to

17

develop post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD.

18

I would like to ask all young

19

women and adult women who were sexually

20

assaulted by Officer Kevin Glover, or any other

21

officers, to have the courage to come forward

22

and tell their stores, just like I did.

me, too, police, too.

I appreciate you sharing

MS. TOWNSEND:

No, I haven't, not at this

PRESIDENT LIGHTFOOT:

What I'm going to ask

12

you to do, Chief Eddie Welch, who's the chief

13

of the Bureau of Internal Affairs, is here.

14

have Judge Banks, who's the acting head of

15

COPA.

16

that a formal complaint can be initiated,

17

allegations can be investigated.

I would ask you to meet with them so

Thank you.

Yeah.

Acknowledging the 7th or 8th

And after hearing these just

6

dreadful horror stories, I just, first of all,

7

need to thank Michael the Archangel, and

8

whatever paramilitary assistance might be

9

necessary to get these things corrected to any

10

victim.

11

I have an immediate problem right

12

now.

The nominal statute of limitation which

13

addresses a lot these systemic problems.

14

to read this because I got to make a demand.

15

This is heading to the Federal Grand Jury, the

16

whole rapport, then the alternative remedies of

17

Magna Carta Clause 51, which are still

18

incorporated to the Constitution, which has

19

been proven clearly by Bundy & Associates the

20

last two weeks, her case dismissed, so the

21

government -- conditions are no longer certain,

22

because the more and more people realize that

23

the activity of the government is not generally

24

ordered to the accomodation of the general

alliance, it is generally ordered to

2

deprivation and fraud of the general alliance.

3

But I have to share a copy of

4

this document.

Document is back there.

I am

5

going to the assistant superintendent, because

6

I have to bind everyone up the chain of

7

command, because what's happening here is the

8

evidentiary to the threshold -- identify a

9

threshold -- identifiable threshold for

10

evidence for constitutional deprivation and

11

other things are not activities in compliance

12

with that.

13

command (inaudible.)

So I got to go with the chain of

14

Right now I got criminal charges

15

instituted on a nominal statute of limitations

16

by Monday and Tuesday respectfully.

17

standard that you need to direct evidence to,

18

including criminal charges, is entirely

19

compatible and promulgates Supreme Court

20

authority that's controlling in this area.

21

Circumstantial evidence is sufficient to

22

institute criminal charges and procure

convictions.

around now.

I got to present this document.

BOARD MEMBER FOREMAN:

MR. MORE:

Thank you, Mr. More.

Please provide me the process so

5

I can bind the Superintendent or assistant,

Ms. Valente, do you

want to speak with Mr. More, please?

12

14

Yes.

MS. NOEL:

Good evening, everyone.

How are

you?

17

First of all, I think what Trina

18

did today actually hurts.

And I'm not supposed

19

to be the one that's upset about this, right?

20

Because it didn't happen to me, but it did.

21

did.

22

Chicago.

23

getting raped by police officers and nothing is

24

happening.

It

And it's happening to women all over
All over the nation.

They are

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

25

 Police Board Public Meeting - January 18, 2018

1

And the main reason why is

2

because the investigations are in the

3

department.

4

people.

You cannot investigate your own

You have to take it out.

5

I'm asking you, Patricia, and I

6

know this is the first time we met, that you do

7

everything in your power to take sexual assault

8

and harassment and abuse away from the police

9

department.

It does not belong here.

It is an

10

issue about women, and it should be handled by

11

women who have the wherewithal and the

12

understanding of women.

13

Do you know that 92 percent of

14

women who say they've been sexually assaulted

15

have been sexually assaulted?

16

It has happened.

So for Trina to stand up here, a

17

mother, she stood up here.

This was a long

18

time ago, and she just got the courage to do

19

this.

20

I mean the police, too, the cops, too,

21

movement.

22

telling you all that she's been sexually

23

assaulted by a police officer, because you know

24

what?

She just got the courage to do this.

So

I want a woman here every month

You should never, ever, ever sexually

doing this, all these police officers, I know

7

some of them know this is happening.

8

This is a cover-up.

9

want that to end.

Harassment, that ain't

Abuse, it ain't one.

Anybody within this

This guy named Gary who knew Glover was

10

Okay?

These are cover-ups.

So I

I'm done with that.

And I just got something to say
