 Rationale for Educational Agreements
2

  Why Do Residents Go To Multiple Hospitals (or Why Do

Multiple Hospitals send their Residents Here)?
¡ 
¡ 

Sending hospital’s resident needs experience not offered at their
hospital (Toxicology).
Receiving hospital needs services of residents in a particular area
(Orthopedics or ENT).

  When A Receiving Hospital Needs Services-They Pay Salary

and Benefits.
¡ 

Both Hospitals Gain
÷  Receiving Hospital¢  Improves care by providing direct care 24/7
¢  Attracts quality attending physicians
¢  Cheaper than having your own residency program.
÷  Sending Hospital
¢  Residents learn - see different patients/stages of disease
¢  Residency program’s reputation is enhanced.

 Resident Reimbursement
3

  Medicare Reimbursement for Training Residents
¡  Indirect Costs
Residents order more tests etc.
÷  Hospital receives higher reimbursement for Medicare charges (~1.35).
¢  Reimbursement level calculation based on Residents/Bed.
÷ 

¡ 

Direct Costs
Receive a % of salary/benefits for each resident trained on site.
÷  Based on the number of inpatient Medicare patients.
÷  Number of residents reimbursed was capped in 1996.
÷  Most hospitals are “over the cap”.
÷ 

¡ 

Stroger’s Medicare Reimbursement
$/resident is lower than most other teaching hospitals.
÷  JSH cap = 450.
÷  Cap sharing is allowed.
÷  Reimbursement offsets some of the salary/benefits paid by the hospital.
÷ 

 Origin of JSH Rotators - (FTE)
4

Rotators=22% of
Residents at JSH

* “Other” includes CCOM, IMMC, JP, LGH, Lurie, Mt Sinai, OLR, RFU, U of C, West Sub, and Weiss

 Oversight of Rotators
5

  Joint Commission Mandates Appropriate Hospital

Oversight
÷  Verification

of licensure/immunization
÷  Orientation to the hospital
÷  Adequate Supervision

  Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical

Education (ACGME) Mandates Appropriate
Educational Oversight
÷  Designee

responsible for the supervision, education and
evaluation of the resident
÷  Written goals and objectives
÷  Educational Agreement

 Educational Agreements - Summary
6
  Need For Rotation Established
¡  Hospital needs to enhance care in an area vs.
Residency needs experience
  Educational Agreement Drafted
¡ 

¡ 

Outline teaching/learning goals, supervision,
designee responsible for oversight
Contractual Aspect
÷ 

¡ 

Duration (usually 3 years), dollars (salary and
benefits)

Approval Process at Stroger

 Overall   
Our   overall   impressions   are   that   CCDPH   
has   strong,   collaboraEve   public   health   
leadership,   a   desire   to   conEnually   
improve   the   department’s   impact   and   
CCDPH   funcEons   well   as   a   department   in   
a   complex   system.   
10   

 Strengths   
•  CollaboraFons   among   the   Departments   
leadership   team   and   with   various   sectors   in   the   
community   
•  Investment   in   policy   development,   staﬀ   training   
and   their   understanding   of   public   health,   local   
data   and   their   legal   requirements   
•  Performance   management   system   and   quality   
improvement   starFng   at   the   program   level.   
11   

 Challenges   
•  IntegraFng   public   health   and   clinical   
medicine   to   improve   populaFon   outcomes   
•  External   branding,   especially   at   partner   
faciliFes   
•  Keeping   the   feeling   of   a   single   organizaFon   
and   vision   among   staﬀ   geographically   spread   
across   a   large   jurisdicFon.   

12   

 Categorize   areas   for   work   
•  Raised   quesFons   about   the   integraFon   of   public   
health   and   primary   care   
•  Raised   quesFons   about   “branding”   swallowed   
up   by   clinical   system   
•  DocumentaFon   of   discussion   and   consideraFon
