NOTICE AND AGENDA

February 6, 2018

WHEREAS, breastfeeding offers proven health benefits for babies and mothers, but women often find it
difficult to continue breastfeeding once they return to the workplace; and
WHEREAS, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), among employed
women with children under age 3, approximately 70 percent work full time and one-third of mothers
return to work within 3 months after giving birth, and two-thirds return within 6 months; and
WHEREAS, challenges to breastfeeding mothers include lack of break time and inadequate facilities for
pumping and storing human milk; and
WHEREAS, providing accommodations for breastfeeding offers numerous rewards for the employer, in
cost savings for health care, reduced absenteeism, employee morale, and employee retention; and
WHEREAS, Cook County and its facilities are unique in that they must accommodate county employees,
workers who are not employed by Cook County but who perform some of their job duties in county
facilities, as well as members of the general public; and
WHEREAS, many of the challenges facing breastfeeding mothers can be reduced with a small
investment of time, money, and flexibility; and
WHEREAS, some Cook County buildings and courthouses currently have space reserved for
breastfeeding mothers, but some challenges remain, and it is incumbent upon this body to evaluate existing
resources and see where there is opportunity for improvement;
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that the
county shall undertake an evaluation of its current lactation rooms and policies for those rooms, with the
goal of having all public buildings owned and operated by Cook County with a designated private room,
other than a restroom, for persons seeking privacy to nurse or express milk, including members of the
public where appropriate; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the private room shall at a minimum include an electrical outlet, a
chair, and a lockable door. Windows, if any, in the private room must have a window treatment
appropriate to ensure privacy; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the management of each building shall make all building staff
aware of the room(s) that have been designated for the use of nursing mothers and what the procedure is
should a member of the public request use of the room(s); and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that all public buildings owned and operated by Cook County post a
sign at the building entrance and outside the public restrooms indicating the availability of the designated

room and the procedure for accessing it; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that where a private room cannot be designated without displacing
staff or having to construct a new room within the facility, and where another option that would
reasonably meet the intent of this resolution cannot be identified, an exception to the requirements of this
resolution will be made.

Effective Date. This resolution shall take effect immediately upon adoption.

NOTICE AND AGENDA

February 6, 2018

WHEREAS, the Supreme Court of Illinois ordered that Illinois Circuit Courts create an Electronic Filing
system (“e-filing”) on January 22, 2016; and
WHEREAS, Illinois Circuit Courts were to implement their e-filing system by January 1, 2018; and
WHEREAS, the Clerk of the Circuit Court of Cook County entered into a contract with On-Line
Information Services in June of 2016 to provide e-filing services; and
WHEREAS, in April of 2017, Tyler Technologies signed a $36 million contract with Cook County to
provide court docketing services that would include matters filed through e-filing in the Circuit Court of
Cook County; and
WHEREAS, to monitor the court docketing services contract, Cook County entered into an agreement
with PriceWaterhouseCooper; and
WHEREAS, Tyler Technologies informed the Clerk, under a different contract with the Illinois Supreme
court, that it would be unable to complete the payment component of the e-filing system by the deadline;
and
WHEREAS, in a November 25, 2017 article in the Chicago Tribune, Circuit Court Clerk Dorothy Brown
stated that her office was prepared for e-filing; and
WHEREAS, on December 13, 2017, Cook County Circuit Court Clerk Dorothy Brown petitioned the
Illinois Supreme Court to extend the deadline for the implementation of e-filing until January 1, 2018 and to
allow permissive e-filing until that time; and
WHEREAS, in her petition to the Illinois Supreme Court, Clerk Brown stated that Tyler Technologies
has been unable to integrate its e-filing software with currently existing proprietary software in place at
the Court and there have been problems with the system’s ability to set dates for case management and
with bulk filing; and
WHEREAS, in response, the Supreme Court gave the Circuit Court an extension of six months until June
30, 2018 to implement the e-filing system and included a number of benchmarks, standards and
requirements to be met during the extension period; and
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Circuit Court Clerk of Cook County and
representatives of On-Line Information Services, Tyler Technologies and PriceWaterhouseCooper
appear before the Legislative and Intergovernmental Relations Committee of the Cook County Board of
Commissioner to review the implementation of e-filing in the Circuit Court of Cook County; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Clerk of the Circuit Court of Cook County be prepared to
