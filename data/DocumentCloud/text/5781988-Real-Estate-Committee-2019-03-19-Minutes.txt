negotiations for the sale of a Surplus Parcel that has been approved for sale by the State Legislature,

Advisory Committee. Subsequently, the Forest Preserves sought and obtained permission, on September
23, 1985 via Public Act 84-867, from the State Legislature to offer the 30 aforementioned parcels,
including Surplus Parcel 12, for sale with the monies to accrue to the Forest Preserves Real Estate
Acquisition Fund.
The Village of Schiller Park (the “Buyer”), has agreed to buy the Surplus Parcel from the Forest
Preserves for the sum of SIX HUNDRED TWENTY-FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND 00/100
($625,000.00) (the “Purchase Price”). The Purchase Price is consistent with M.A.I. certified appraisals
obtained by the Forest Preserves. The Purchase Price will be payable in ten (10) annual cash installments
to begin on the effective date of the agreement, and each year thereafter, in the amount of $60,000.00
prior to closing and $25,000.00 at the time of closing. No interest rate, fee or penalty provision shall be
applicable. If any cash installment is not received by the Forest Preserves on the effective date of the
agreement, and each year thereafter, the Forest Preserves shall send written notice to the Buyer
demanding such payment and the Buyer shall have ninety (90) days from the date of the notice to comply.
If the Buyer does not comply within the ninety (90) day period, the Forest Preserves shall have the option
to terminate the agreement and keep any cash installments already received. Additionally, the Buyer has
agreed to accept title to the Surplus Parcel with a covenant or deed restriction limiting use of the Surplus
Parcel to recreational space for public use.
Permission is now sought, upon satisfactory completion of all due diligence and negotiation of any and all
required documentation as determined by the Forest Preserves’ legal department, to accept the
aforementioned Purchase Price and terms, less any customary closing costs, as full compensation for the
sale of the Surplus Parcel and to convey by quitclaim deed all of the Forest Preserves’ right, title and
interest in the Surplus Parcel.
