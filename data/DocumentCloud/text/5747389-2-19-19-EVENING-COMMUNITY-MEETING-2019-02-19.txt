OIG File Nos. 18-0008-INV and 18-0042-INV

Dear Ms. Fiore and Ms. Ha:
The Office of the Inspector General (“OIG”) issued a debarment against Joan Fiore and Javion & Sam’s
Towing Service, Inc. (“Javion & Sam’s”). The debarred parties have asserted an appeal of this decision
and are entitled to a hearing (the “Hearing”) within 45 days of the Detroit City Council’s receipt of the
appeal letter. See Detroit City Code, Section 18-11-11. The City Clerk will provide the official
notification of the Hearing date, but my understanding is that it is tentatively scheduled for Tuesday,
February 19, 2019 at 1:00 pm.
The Hearing will be conducted before the Detroit City Council as a whole, in the Committee of the Whole
room on the 13th floor of the Coleman A. Young Municipal Center. Either side may use the room’s
screens and A/V equipment (e.g. to show “PowerPoint” slides), but must submit their content on a USB
drive storage device at least one week in advance. At the Hearing, each appellant will be allowed ten (10)
minutes to present oral argument to City Council; the OIG will be permitted five (5) minutes to give
responsive oral argument. Appellants may combine or exchange time as they choose but must provide
notice one week in advance. My office will serve as timekeeper, and the City Council President will be
the presiding officer for the Hearing.
Please be advised that the entire City Council has been provided all of your written submissions on
appeal, and there is no need to supplement the record. However, if you wish, you may submit a summary
– no longer than three (3) pages and consistent with the Filing Standards provided in Michigan Court
Rule 1.109 (C)(1), stating your position, at least one week in advance of the Hearing. If you send the
summary to me, my office will ensure that the summary is received by all members of Council before the
Hearing.
After the Hearing and pursuant to Detroit City Code Sec. 18-11-11, City Council will decide: (1) whether
the OIG’s debarment decision was based on a preponderance of evidence; and (2) whether the penalty
assessed by the OIG is appropriate under the ordinance. The standard of City Council’s review in
deciding these two matters will be abuse of discretion.
Sincerely,
