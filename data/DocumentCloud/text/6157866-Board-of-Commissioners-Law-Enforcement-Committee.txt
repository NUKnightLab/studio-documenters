PROPOSED ORDINANCE

COOK COUNTY ANIMAL ABUSER REGISTRY

WHEREAS, the State of Illinois and the County of Cook have criminalized abuse and cruelty towards
animals; and

WHEREAS, despite these laws against animal cruelty and abuse, animal cruelty continues to be a
problem in Illinois and Cook County; and

WHEREAS, the number of cruelty cases reported daily on various media sources is not re?ective of the
actual number of cases, as most cases are never reported, and most animal suffering goes unrecognized
and unabated; and

WHEREAS, further complicating this issue is the fact that, unlike violent crimes against people,
information on reported cases of animal abuse have not been compiled by state and federal agencies,
making it dif?cult to calculate the prevalence or trends in these crimes; and

WHEREAS, intentional cruelty to animals is strongly correlated with other crimes, including violence
against people, and data on domestic violence and child abuse cases reveal that a staggering number of
animals are victimized by abusive parents or partners each year; and

WHEREAS, in light of the above-mentioned link between animal abuse and crimes against people,
including violent crimes and domestic violence, after a years-long lobbying effort and the backing of the
National Sheriffs Association and the Animal Welfare Institute, in 2014, the FBI agreed to elevate
animal cruelty to its own separate offense category de?ned as ?Intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly
taking an action that mistreats or kills any animal without just cause, such as torturing, tormenting,
mutilation, maiming, poisoning, or abandonment?; and

Page 2 of 16

WHEREAS, 2016 marks the ?rst time the FBI will collect data on animal crimes the way it does for
other serious crimes such as homicide or rape by having their own organized category within the
National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS), the public collection of national crime
statistics; and

WHEREAS, the goal is that after several years of collecting statistics other law enforcement agencies
will be able to see trends that will allow them to better allocate their resources to catching animal
abusers and in the process hopefully better protect both animals and people; and

WHEREAS, it is in the best interest of the residents of Cook County and their animals that an online
registry be established identifying individuals residing in Cook County convicted of animal abuse
crimes that will prevent these individuals from adopting, purchasing, or otherwise obtaining animals
from any animal shelter, pet seller, or other person or entity involved in the exchange of animals by
adoption, sale, or other means.
