Report from System Director of Quality, Patient Safety, Regulatory and Accreditation
A. Regulatory and Accreditation Updates
B. Publicly Reported Ratings
Dr. Krishna Das, System Director of Quality, Patient Safety, Regulatory and Accreditation, provided an
update on regulatory and accreditation visits; she noted that there were three items to discuss.
The first matter was regarding a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) inspection of the Blood Bank that
had occurred back in September; this was a routine bi-annual survey. The report from that inspection was
recently received - there were no citations from this visit whatsoever; she noted that there were a couple of
minor suggestions which have been incorporated.
The second matter involved a survey by Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) staff of the dialysis
unit on January 26, 2014; this was a routine tri-annual survey performed for accreditation. The survey went
very well and there were no citations received. Dr. Das stated that a final report is yet to be received;
however, at the exit conference there were no issues that were presented for improvement.
The third matter relates to a for-cause survey by IDPH staff based on a patient complaint that was submitted
to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). No official report has been received yet on the
survey; the Committee will be informed when the report is received. It was not specific as to the exact
nature of the patient complaint, but it sounded like two issues – one issue involved a pressure ulcer that the
patient had, and the second issue related to language and interpretation for this patient.

Report from System Director of Quality, Patient Safety, Regulatory and Accreditation (continued)
C. Annual Report on Graduate Medical Education (GME) (Attachment #1)
Dr. John O’Brien, Director of Professional Education, reviewed the presentation regarding the Annual
Report on GME. The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
During his presentation, Dr. O’Brien noted that one of the Department’s functions is maintain the
educational agreements; these agreements codify how long the residents will be here, how many will
participate, and, in some instances, if there is money involved, what the payment will be. He added that this
subject will be addressed in a Board meeting in the near future, because a number of those agreements will
be expiring in June.
