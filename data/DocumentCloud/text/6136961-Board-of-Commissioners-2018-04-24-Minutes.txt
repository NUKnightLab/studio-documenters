JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

WHEREAS, on February 3, 1958, President Dwight D. Eisenhower established Law Day by issuing a
Proclamation proclaiming it "fitting that the people of this Nation should remember with pride and
vigilantly guard the great heritage of liberty, justice, and equality under law which our forefathers
bequeathed to us." Every President since has issued an annual Law Day Proclamation; and
WHEREAS, in 2018, we celebrate the 60th Anniversary of Law Day’s establishment in 1958 by President
Dwight D. Eisenhower; and
WHEREAS, on April 7, 1961, Congress passed a Joint Resolution that designated May 1 as Law Day. The
theme of Law Day 2018 is "Separation of Powers: Framework for Freedom"; and
WHEREAS, the U.S. Constitution sets out a system of government with three distinct and independent
branches that share the power-the Congress, the Presidency, and the Supreme Court; and
WHEREAS, Article I of the Constitution vests legislative power in Congress to write and pass federal
laws; Article II of the Constitution vests executive power in the President to enforce federal laws; and
Article III of the Constitution vests judicial power in the Supreme Court and lower federal courts to decide
whether a law or executive action is unconstitutional by exercising judicial review; and
WHEREAS, the Constitution also provides the three separate branches with specific powers allowing each
to serve as a check on the other branches in order to maintain a balance of power and to preserve political
liberty; and
WHEREAS, this Law Day provides an opportunity for us, the people, to understand how power is shared
among the three branches of our federal government and our role in this framework for freedom. We must
consider how to become informed and engaged with government and to work together to preserve our
liberties and advance our rights.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and the Cook County Board of
Commissioners do hereby recognize May 1, 2018 as National Law Day and its theme of "Separation of
Powers: Framework for Freedom"; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that Cook County Law Library will celebrate Law Day by continuing in
its mission of providing legal information resources and educational opportunities as a component of access

- who was named Larry Bird Player of the Year in the Missouri Valley Conference and was also named as
a First Team Scholar-Athlete in the Missouri Valley Conference --hit a 15-foot jump shot with 3.6 seconds
left in the game to seal the victory for the Ramblers, 63-62; and
WHEREAS, in the third round (the Sweet Sixteen) of the NCAA Tournament on March 22, Loyola's
opponent was the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, ranked as the seventh seed in the South Region. The
Ramblers played with great enthusiasm and precision, led this time by Marques Townes, who scored 18
points -- including a 3-pointer with 6.3 seconds left in the game when Loyola was ahead by one point. With
a four-point lead the Ramblers held on to win 69-68; and
WHEREAS, in the fourth round (the Elite Eight) on March 24, the Ramblers played Kansas State
University, ranked as the ninth seed in the South Region. Teamwork once again was paramount for Loyola
and, like the three previous tournament games, "a star was born" - this time, it was Ben Richardson - who
previously had been named as the Missouri Valley Conference's Defensive Player of the Year -- who scored
23 points, including six (6) of seven (7) three-pointers. Richardson was also a First Team Scholar-Athlete
in the Missouri Valley Conference and was honored as the South Region's Most Outstanding Player. By
virtue of its 78-62 victory over Kansas State, Loyola won the South Region and moved on to the Final Four
for the first time since 1963, extending its winning streak to 14, the longest of any team in the Tournament;
and
WHEREAS, in the fifth round (the Final Four), on March 31, Loyola's opponent was the University of
Michigan, ranked as the third seed in the West Region. The Ramblers played with heart and enthusiasm
and led at halftime 29-22, an incredible effort given how powerful Michigan's offense had been all season.
However, with about six (6) minutes left in the game, Michigan took the lead and ended up winning the
game; and
WHEREAS, throughout Loyola's NCAA Tournament run, Sister Jean Dolores Schmidt was an inspiration
to the team. As team chaplain, "Sister Jean" (as she is affectionately known) inspired and motivated The
Ramblers in innumerable ways. Sister Jean has served in the Order of the Sisters of Charity of the Blessed
Virgin (BVM) since 1937 and has been team chaplain since 1996. Now, at the tender age of 98 she cemented
the team ethos with her signature phrase: "Worship. Work and Win." In addition to her other honors, Sister
Jean had bestowed upon her one of the greatest of sports honors: a bobblehead doll from the National
Bobblehead Hall of Fame and Museum. By the end of the tournament, Sister Jean, was not just Loyola's
treasure but the Nation's as well; and
WHEREAS, Loyola University Chicago has a long and storied history in basketball. In 1963 Loyola broke
with college basketball's unwritten rule that no team should have more than two black players on the court
at any given time and in so doing, created a national conversation on race which led to the elimination of
the limit on black players' court time. On March 15, 1963, in the NCAA Tournament, Loyola played
Mississippi State University. The governor of Mississippi had instructed the all-white Mississippi State
team not to play against an integrated team. Their coach and players refused to follow the instruction, and

the game became known as the Game of Change. Loyola would go on to defeat the two-time defending
champion, University of Cincinnati Bearcats (ranked No. 1 in the Nation), to win the National
Championship. Loyola remains the only Illinois school to ever win the NCAA Basketball title; and
WHEREAS, Loyola University Chicago is a Jesuit school founded in 1870. Its main Campus, known as
the Lake Shore Campus, is in the Rogers Park neighborhood on the northeast side while its downtown
campus, known as the Water Tower Campus, is next to Chicago's famed Magnificent Mile. Loyola has an
enrollment of more than 16,000 students and boasts 150,000 alumni, 85,000 of whom live in the Chicago
area; and
WHEREAS, as a Jesuit school, Loyola takes seriously its role in shaping students' lives. This is especially
true of student-athletes, many of whom will never play professional sports. The degree they earn at Loyola
is meaningful because of the school's commitment to their education, which takes the form of mentoring
and tutoring to help guide them through a rigorous academic and athletic schedule. Student-Athletes at
Loyola have a graduation rate of 99 percent. Only five (5) other schools in Division I sports have a
graduation rate that high, four (4) of them in the Ivy League; and
WHEREAS, all of Cook County is grateful and honored for the positive national attention brought to
Loyola University and our region. Head Coach Porter Moser and the entire group of players -- Adarius
Avery, Jake Baughman, Dylan Boehm, Clayton Custer, Nick Dinardi, Donte Ingram, Aundre Jackson,
Cameron Krutwig, Christian Negron, Ben Richardson, Cameron Satterwhite, Carson Shanks, Bruno
Skokna, Marques Townes, Aher Uguak and Lucas Williamson -- are rightly proud of their season and
accomplishments.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that we, the President and Members of the Cook County
Board of Commissioners, assembled this twenty-fourth day of April, 2018, do hereby congratulate the
Loyola University Chicago Men's Basketball Team for its great season and its success in the NCAA
Tournament; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a suitable copy of this Resolution be presented to Coach Porter
Moser as a token of our esteem and good wishes.

RECOGNIZING THE WORK OF AUTISM SPEAKS DURING NATIONAL AUTISM
AWARENESS MONTH
WHEREAS, autism is a bio-neurological developmental disability that generally appears before the age of
3, and impacts the normal development of the brain in the areas of social interaction, communication skills,
and cognitive function; and
WHEREAS, individuals with autism typically have difficulties in verbal and non-verbal communication,
social interactions, and leisure or play activities; and
WHEREAS, autism is diagnosed four times more often in boys than girls, and its prevalence is not affected
by race, region, or socio-economic status. Since autism was first diagnosed in the U.S. the incidence has
climbed to an alarming one in 68 children in the U.S.; and,
WHEREAS, autism itself does not affect life expectancy, however research has shown that the mortality
risk among individuals with autism is twice as high as the general population, in large part due to drowning
and other accidents; and
WHEREAS, currently there is no cure for autism, though with early intervention and treatment, the diverse
symptoms related to autism can be greatly improved and in some cases completely overcome; and
WHEREAS, Autism Speaks, a national research and advocacy organization whose Chicago chapter resides
in the 10th District, is dedicated to promoting solutions for the needs of individuals with autism and their
families through advocacy and support; increasing understanding and acceptance of people with autism
spectrum disorder; and advancing research into causes and better interventions for autism spectrum disorder
and related conditions; and
WHEREAS, building upon the legacy of three (3) leading autism organizations, Autism Coalition for
Research and Education (ACRE), the National Alliance for Autism Research (NAAR) and Cure Autism
Now (CAN), who merged with the organization, Autism Speaks has made extraordinary advancements in
the autism community. Chief among these are increased global awareness of autism, better understanding
of the breadth of the autism spectrum, and advocacy to increase research and access to care and support;
and
WHEREAS, today, Autism Speaks is dedicated to advancing research into causes and better treatments
for autism spectrum disorders and related conditions both through direct funding and collaboration;
increasing understanding and acceptance of autism spectrum disorders; and working toward solutions for
the needs of individuals with autism and their families across the spectrum and lifespan through advocacy
and support; and
WHEREAS, locally, schools throughout Chicago and Cook County who offer support and specialized and
innovative curriculum and programming to children diagnosed with autism are commended for their work
during this month, including Agassiz Elementary, Coonley Elementary and the Chicago Agriculture High
School.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners recognizes
the month of April as Autism Awareness Month and commends Autism Speaks for their continued research
and advocacy in the autism community, and our local neighborhood schools who do year-round work to
support and advocate for autism awareness...
