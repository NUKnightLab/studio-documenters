to

enter

into

an

Intergovernmental

Agreement

with

MWRD

for

the

reconstruction and maintenance of the Lyons Levee
Goods or Services:

Grant of permanent and temporary easements and waiver of tree mitigation fees to

allow MWRD to improve, raise, and maintain the Lyons Levee from Joliet Road downstream in Ottawa
Trail Woods to south of 47th Street along the west edge of the Chicago Portage National Historic Site
Agreement Number(s): N/A
Agreement Period: Continuous
Fiscal Impact: None
Accounts: N/A
District(s): 16
Summary: MWRD, under an agreement with the United States Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) for the design and

construction, proposes to repair, rehabilitate, and replace the Lyons Levee to protect against a 100-year
flood event. In April 2013, floodwater from the Des Plaines River overtopped the Lyons Levee and
flooded a portion of the Village of Forest View. The FPCC acquired the property containing the Lyons
Levee along the Des Plaines River from MWRD in 1950. The conveyance deed provided that the grantee
(the FPCC) would continue to maintain the existing or new levees. The proposed 11.21 acre permanent
easements and 1.05 acre temporary easement will provide access and right of entry to MWRD and the
Corps for the construction, operation and maintenance of the levee. The proposed agreement is subject to
final review and approval by the FPCC’s Legal Department.
