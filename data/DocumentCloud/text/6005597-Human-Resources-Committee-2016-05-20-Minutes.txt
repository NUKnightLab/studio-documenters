Recommendations, Discussion / Information Item
A.

Strategic planning discussion

Discussion continued through the Finance Committee Meeting scheduled for 10:00 A.M., following this
meeting.
Topic: Health Information Systems, presented by Donna Hart, Chief Information Officer (Attachment #3)
Dr. John Jay Shannon, Chief Executive Officer, stated that Ms. Hart will be reviewing a strategic planning
presentation on Health Information Systems (HIS). Additionally, he introduced Richard Sewell, Associate Dean
of Community and Public Health Practice at UIC School of Public Health, who will be facilitating the strategic
planning discussions in these meetings through to the adoption of a full strategic plan in the summer.
Ms. Hart provided an overview of the presentation, which included information on the following subjects:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

HIS Overview;
Information Technology (IT) Steering Initiatives;
Strategic Planning Framework Guidelines;
Projects in Motion;
IT Risks;
Vision;
Achieving the Vision; and
Goal.

Following the presentation, Board Chairman Hammock stated that, in one sense, while billing systems continue to
be needed, the financial challenge now is to get a robust cost system in place; this is critical to CCHHS’ ultimate
financial health. He requested that staff from the Finance and Health Information System Departments return
with a plan to implement this; he would like to look at the issue, if not during, then after the strategic planning
process. Chairman Wiese added that the cost system should include data on cost per unit for items.
Director Richardson-Lowry requested that a departmental organizational chart be provided to the Committee
through the Chair that identifies the vacant positions in the department; she stated that having a sense of where
those vacancies exist would be very helpful.
During the discussion of the information relating to the System’s contract with Cerner, Director RichardsonLowry inquired regarding the processes used to analyze the benefits, achievements and potential gaps in
expectations or outcomes identified following the execution and implementation of a large-scale, multi-year
contract like Cerner. Ms. Hart stated that this contract contains milestones and Service Level Agreements; the
milestones are reviewed every quarter. Director Richardson-Lawry responded that the information was helpful;
she requested that a benchmark analysis be provided to the Committee through the Chair.

VII. Adjourn
As the agenda was exhausted, Chairman Wiese declared the meeting ADJOURNED.

 VISION
“To improve and promote the utilization of
health information technology, to its highest
capacity, by both patients and health care
providers, to optimize health outcomes and
overall quality.”

Page 32 of 38

17

 Achieving the Vision
Develop/Implement an IT staffing plan that is
reflective of the healthcare IT industry.

• Build a hybrid team consisting of core CCHHS staff,
augmented by contracted subject matter experts.
• Allows for flexibility and rapid response of hiring
in a competitive environment.
• Continuing support/maintenance of implemented
systems.

Page 33 of 38

18

 Achieving the Vision
Continued investment in the latest IT
infrastructure technology across the health
system.

• Allows for more predictive outcomes with
upgrades and greater protection from external
security threats.
• Fulfills the need to keep up with the technology in
order to maintain the highest level of productivity.
• Move to a leased environment to allow
continuous refresh of technology.
Page 34 of 38

19

 Achieving the Vision
Continued investment in EMR optimization to
improve efficiency, safety, quality of care and
ultimately user satisfaction across the health
system.

• Investment in the integration of clinical
equipment with EMR to improve efficiency and
reduce errors.
• Replace “best-of-breed,” stand-alone systems with
Cerner EMR integrated solutions, when possible,
to minimize interfaces, complexity and potential
points of failure.
Page 35 of 38

20

 Achieving the Vision
Connect patients, providers and community
partners with CCHHS.

• Integrate information exchange with community
partners via HIE and robust and timely exchange
of electronic continuity of care documents.
• Improve patient accessibility and usage of internet
portals/ online resources.
• Increase interoperability and cost savings by
