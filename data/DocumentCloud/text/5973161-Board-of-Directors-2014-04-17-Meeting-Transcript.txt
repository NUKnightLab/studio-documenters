ALDERMAN POPE:

Good morning, everyone.

2

It's a little bit after 10:00, 10:06, and we're

3

going to call the Infrastructure meeting to

4

order.

5
6

Present today, we have on the phone
with us James Bell.

James, can you hear us?

7

CHAIRMAN BELL:

I can hear you fine.

8

ALDERMAN POPE:

James is communicating

9

with us --

10

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Can you hear me okay?

11

ALDERMAN POPE:

Yes, we can, sir.

12

Present today are Jorge Ramirez,

13

Diana Ferguson and John Pope.

14

item is the call to order.

15

The first agenda

Moving on to Item No. 2,

16

organizational matters.

17

is the approval of the November 6th and

18

November 12th, 2013 minutes.

19
20

Has the Board had a chance to review
the minutes?

21

24

Any questions?
(No response.)

22
23

The first item there

Do I have a motion to approve the
minutes?
MS. FERGUSON:

Move approval.

 3
1

MR. RAMIREZ:

2

ALDERMAN POPE:

3
4
5
6

Second.
Moved and seconded.

All in favor?
(A chorus of ayes.)
Opposed?
(No response.)

7

The ayes have it.

8

Moving onto Item B is the

9
10

contracting manual.
MR. BEITLER:

So for the contracting

11

manual, basically, as we've mentioned

12

previously, it's a living document.

13

probably come to the Board most every session

14

with some improvements.

15

We will

In this particular case, we are

16

looking to improve how we deal with unsolicited

17

proposals much more effectively, and in

18

particular there were some things that were

19

missing, such as the need to protect proprietary

20

information that were omitted from the previous

21

version of the contracting manual.

22

probably the major item in the unsolicited

23

proposal section.

24

That's

So we ask that the Board of the

 4
1

Trust approve the new version of the contracting

2

manual.

3

MR. RAMIREZ:

4

MS. FERGUSON:

5

ALDERMAN POPE:

6

seconded.

Second.
Motion made and

All in favor?

7
8

Motion.

(A chorus of ayes.)
Opposed?

9

(No response.)

10

The ayes have it.

11

The next item is the resolution for

12
13

the audit RFP.
MR. BEITLER:

So with the assistance

14

or the direction of our outside accounting firm

15

and our legal team, we have drafted an audit

16

RFP, and this is the resolution to proceed with

17

the audit RFP to select an auditor so that we

18

can proceed with the annual audit.

19

While there's no requirement, we

20

will also do an audit of the stub year from the

21

beginning of the Trust to just dot all the I's

22

and cross all the T's.

23

ALDERMAN POPE:

And, Steve, any idea

24

what the timing of that would be?

 5
1

MR. BEITLER:

We will -- If the Board

2

approves the RFP proposal, we will issue it

3

immediately, and with a couple of week

4

turnaround.

5

MS. FERGUSON:

How many firms do you

6

anticipate sending it out to?

7

MR. BEITLER:

Well, probably at least a

8

dozen firms that we anticipate sending it to.

9

We're trying to send it to firms that are MBE,

10

WBE, DBE, et cetera.

11

MR. RAMIREZ:

Local?

12

MR. BEITLER:

I'm sorry?

13

MR. RAMIREZ:

Most of them are local?

14

MR. BEITLER:

We're not -- I mean,

15

there could be a national firm that I suppose

16

gets it, but we're focusing on local firms.

17

TREASURER NEELY:

18

post it on the website?

19

select few?

20

MR. BEITLER:

Why wouldn't we just

Why send it out to a

Well, we are posting it

21

on the website, so that is our main methodology,

22

but if somebody brings a name to the Trust and

23

says this is somebody that ought to respond to

24

this, we just want to make sure that they see

 6
1
2

it.
MS. FERGUSON:

And is Washington

3

Pittman & McKeever exempted from participating

4

or are they going to --

5

MR. BEITLER:

6

because they're our accountant.

7

MS. FERGUSON:

8

MR. RAMIREZ:

9
10

They cannot participate

Thank you.
Is anyone willing to do

it for free, do we know?
MR. BEITLER:

You know, I think that

11

there's actually -- I think there's an issue

12

with asking a firm to do your audit for free

13

because of the conflict that's associated.

14

There may be others who have a different view of

15

that, but my view is it creates a conflict that

16

we don't want to have.

17

MR. RAMIREZ:

Motion.

18

MS. FERGUSON:

19

ALDERMAN POPE:

Second.
Before we move on that,

20

make sure that everyone speaks into the

21

microphone so the court report can properly

22

document.

23
24

So there has been a motion and
seconded.

All in favor?

 7
1

(A chorus of ayes.)

2

Opposed?

3

(No response.)

4

Once again the ayes have it.

5

The final item under the

6

organizational matters is the budget.

7

MR. BEITLER:

We are going to ask

8

Vivian Funches from Washington Pittman &

9

McKeever to come to the podium to discuss budget

10

matters.

11

This is really information only.

12

There is no budget item to approve today.

13

just sort of where are we at the moment.

14

MS. FUNCHES:

Good morning.

It's

The first

15

statement is the statement of financial

16

position, and this is December the 31st, 2013.

17

Our total assets which consists of cash of

18

$32,335, grants receivable of 57,760 and prepaid

19

expenses of 1,525 with a total assets of

20

$91,620, with current liabilities of 91,620,

21

and our total liabilities and net assets is

22

91,620.

23
24

Unaudited numbers for the statement
of activities budget versus actual.

Our actual

 8
1

revenue is 503,748 compared to budget of

2

835,397, which is a favorable budget of 331,649.

3

The annual budget was 1.4 million

4

and we're forecasting our total income for the

5

first quarter of 337,869.

6

was 503,748 with a balance of zero.

7

revenue, no expenses over income.

Total expenses actual
No excess

8

So the total budget, expenses were

9

835,397, and our expenses were under budget by

10

331,649.

Favorable budget.

11

was 1.4, and our forecast expenses are 337,869.

12

The annual budget

Again, these are unaudited numbers

13

and we expect to have the audit completed by mid

14

May.

Any questions?

15
16
17

(No response.)
ALDERMAN POPE:

Board or Advisory Members?

18

(No response.)

19

If not, can I have a motion to

20

approve the budget?

21

I'm sorry.

22
23
24

Any questions by the

It's not even a matter.

So we'll move onto the next item,
the Retrofit update.
MR. BEITLER:

Steve?
So before we launch into

 9
1

the Retrofit update, I want to call your

2

attention to this slide, and I think that the

3

main point of this slide is that the Trust has

4

actually begun to attract projects from outside

5

investors.

6

I think that the reason, one in

7

particular, that we're doing that is because of

8

the unsolicited proposal process.

9

to go through these projects because we'll be

10

discussing them at length with the individuals

11

who are working on them, but I think that it's

12

just very important to note that the initiatives

13

that we're beginning to see are as a direct

14

result of creating processes that are beginning

15

to attract private sector investors, and it's a

16

nice feeling to begin to have that occur.

17

I'm not going

So with that, the first program that

18

we'll delve into is Municipal Retrofit.

19

ask Clair Tramm to come up and discuss that with

20

us.

21

I'll

I do want to make one point before

22

Claire takes the podium, which is that the only

23

change from a material standpoint in this

24

program since we've been talking about it and

 10
1

passed the resolutions is that the size of the

2

program has decreased.

3

Claire will go into that, but as the

4

size is decreased, it is still within the

5

constraints of the resolution that the Board

6

passed.

7

MS. TRAMM:

8
9
10

Thanks, Steve.

So I think we've seen slide 11
before.

It's just an overall profile of the

Retrofit 1 project.

11

I think slide 12 goes into a little

12

bit more depth on the actual details of the

13

final transaction.

14

November, selected an efficiency services

15

agreement and that was approved by City Council

16

in January.

17

So as you reviewed in

This involves an off credit, off

18

balance sheet financing for the City by

19

structuring the agreement in a way where the

20

Trust is both taking an ESCO guarantee for the

21

savings as well as letting the City pay per

22

units of energy saved.

23
24

The final scope of the deal was 60
buildings, 18 percent reduction in energy use in

 11
1

these buildings, 36 wards, 108 jobs and a

2

savings of $1.5 million annually to pay for that

3

1.2 upfront million project cost.

4

We did close it at a 4.95 percent

5

interest rate.

6

transaction right now and expect to have the

7

actual work begun by the end of March.

8

We're finalizing that

We were able to do it with a

9

15-year contract, and so that is one of the

10

reasons, in addition to the slightly higher

11

interest rate due to the City's credit rating

12

downgrade that we did have to shrink the size of

13

the project.

14

So on Page --

15

TREASURER NEELY:

16

MS. TRAMM:

17

TREASURER NEELY:

Can I ask a question?

Go ahead.
Do you have a

18

comparable municipal rate for a 15-year bond

19

which is comparable to the City's rating to

20

compare this 4.95 percentages rate to?

21

MS. TRAMM:

The independent transaction

22

reviewer noted that this was only 20 basis

23

points above what the City's bonds were

24

currently trading at.

I think it was Phoenix

 12
1

Capital Partners in December wrote that

2

independent review of the transaction.

3

MR. RAMIREZ:

But it's locked.

We're

4

going to get into that.

5

future, the potential downgrades and we're good

6

to go.

7

MS. TRAMM:

It's locked in the

There are no potential

8

changes for that rate.

9

concerned about that.

10

MR. RAMIREZ:

Obviously we're most

Maybe I am moving ahead a

11

little bit, but the next slide should have been

12

before this one because I think it does a great

13

job of syncing up the timeline.

14

MS. TRAMM:

So the next two slides

15

speak to the timeline and we're hoping to have

16

it completed, again as I said, you know, mid

17

March.

18

And, you know, 13 I think is a good

19

overview of how far we've come and really what

20

all the steps have been in closing our very

21

first deal for the Trust.

22

If there's no questions on Page 13,

23

I'll move to Page 14.

24

MR. SILVERS:

Go ahead, Damon.
This is Damon Silvers

 13
1

from the Advisory Board.

2

I just had a question about the

3

summary of the deal here before we move onto the

4

extensive timeline.

5

MS. TRAMM:

6

MR. SILVERS:

Absolutely.
Well, two things.

I want

7

to just commend you all on the basic financing.

8

It's a very good deal.

9

And, secondly, I had a question.

10

You know, one hears a lot of different estimates

11

about what level of energy savings is possible

12

in retrofits like this, and I wondered if you

13

can give us any background on the 18 percent

14

number.

15

MS. TRAMM:

So that's a really good

16

question.

17

completely depending actually on the financing

18

you can get, so there's a delicate balance

19

between, you know, the energy economics, the

20

underlying economics in the building and, you

21

know, what kind of capital you can get, how long

22

the capital is for.

23
24

In projects like this, it's

So we ended up getting 15-year money
which really is 14-year because you have

 14
1

construction period and, you know, it's at

2

almost 5 percent rate.

3

determines how deep we can dig in each building.

4

If we had say 50-year capital, maybe

So that is really what

5

we could make the things that had 40-year

6

paybacks but really had another 10 percent

7

savings work, so really that number is -- it's

8

completely, you know, a general equilibrium

9

number with the underlying energy economics

10
11

actually.
MR. RAMIREZ:

I only had one other

12

followup question.

I didn't see it in here, but

13

I know I've seen it before about the number of

14

jobs that are created and things like that.

15

don't know if you have any --

16

MS. TRAMM:

I

Page 12, we calculated it

17

will create at least a hundred jobs, 108 was I

18

believe not, you know, a multiplier about nine

19

per million spent which is very conservative

20

frankly, and I actually advocated for a higher

21

number, but I think we all agree that this was

22

the minimum number we could all agree on based

23

on the best research available.

24

MR. RAMIREZ:

Okay.

Great.

 15
1

MS. TRAMM:

If there are no further

2

questions on 12, I think I'll skip 13 because

3

we've already sort of addressed the timeline and

4

where we've come and how far we have come

5

frankly in the last year.

6

14, just to recount, so how did we

7

get from an announced hundred million dollar

8

deal down to a 12 or 13 million dollar deal?

9

Before the CIT was involved, the

10

second bullet is that it was reduced

11

essentially to 76 million which consisted of 37

12

million for Department of Water Management's

13

project which was then put on hold due to the

14

lien structure.

15

They have a number, six to seven

16

revenue bonds, that create quite a set of

17

encumbrances on that property, and so it makes

18

it difficult for us at this time until some of

19

those bonds come due in the next year or two for

20

us to finance it the way we'd like.

21

Secondly, that 76 million consisted

22

of about 11.4 million of Chicago Public School's

23

lighting financing which we did not end up

24

recommending be financed through an efficiency

 16
1

service agreement.

2

through a lease which did not require the

3

Trust's involvement, although we did connect

4

them with that financing and handle that, so

5

they were very grateful for that.

6

It got financed I believe

15.3 million of the 27.5 million 2FM

7

project which we have actually focused on could

8

not be financed at that interest rate over a

9

14-year period.

10

So to Damon's point earlier, this is

11

exactly the kind of general equilibrium that you

12

have to balance, you know, when you're doing off

13

credit, off balance sheet financing.

14

can't finance everything you'd love to do.

15

has to pay for itself within the term of the

16

financing that you're offered.

17

up with the 12.2 million project that's in

18

progress now.

19

You just
It

So we've ended

Page 15 just shows you the calendar

20

looking forward.

Again we're finalizing the

21

documents, and I think we've made tremendous

22

progress in the last month or so since the City

23

Council approved the deal, and we expect that

24

we'll be able to close the transaction the week

 17
1

of March 10th and actually hit the ground

2

running March 24th.

3

that.

4

We're very excited with

So Page 16 just shows how the Trust

5

will play a role and all the other key parties

6

involved will play a role post transaction

7

close.

8

So the ESCOs, Schneider Electric,

9

Ameresco and NORESCO play support and primary

10

roles.

11

by the Trust to essentially be the project

12

manager and the construction manager for the

13

project and was selected also by 2FM to do that.

14

That's their traditional role.

15

PBC, as you can see, has been contracted

They will play just a role during

16

the construction period.

17

a transaction that's entirely done through the

18

ESCO, 2FM and Trust relationships, which you see

19

sort of at the bottom of the right column.

20

After that it becomes

So are there any further questions

21

on Retrofit 1 before I move to the next project?

22

Sue?

23

MS. BARRETT:

Quick question.

24

Barrett on the Advisory Board.

Mary Sue

 18
1

Quick question about this

2

relationship you just referred to with the

3

Public Building Commission.

4

typical, as you look forward, delineation of

5

responsibilities or deployment of the Public

6

Building Commission?

7

MS. TRAMM:

Is that a fairly

In this case 2FM lacks its

8

own internal capabilities to oversee

9

construction projects.

They are able, once the

10

construction is finished, to oversee the ongoing

11

operations and maintenance, but they don't have

12

the internal capacity to oversee or manage the

13

construction.

14

And so when we serve 2FM in the

15

future, we believe that this will be the

16

status -- you know, the status quo and expected

17

way of doing projects with them.

18

be the case for other sister agencies.

19

have to take each one as it comes.

That may not

20

MS. BARRETT:

Thank you.

21

MR. BEITLER:

Thanks, Claire.

22

We'll

We just wanted you to see what some

23

of the other potential projects are that will be

24

coming up in terms of retrofit, and among those

 19
1

is street lighting, and Claire will also be

2

addressing the street lighting project.

3
4

MS. TRAMM:

Thanks.

So the first candidate project for

5

Retrofit 2.0 is the street light upgrade for the

6

city which we are proposing to issue very

7

shortly an RFI for, request for information, in

8

order to get back responses about what's

9

possible for the market.

10

The reason we're suggesting we go to

11

an RFI rather than an RFP at this point is

12

because we've -- if you look at Page 19, there

13

are a number of really interesting things that

14

streetlights can be used for as a platform

15

beyond just the energy savings that can pay for

16

the capital upgrades themselves.

17

There have been cost effective

18

energy savings upgrade in D.C., New York, L.A.

19

and a number of other cities around the world,

20

however, the platform area is a very innovative

21

and new thing that we need to -- we don't

22

necessarily know exactly who will respond and

23

what they will come back with, and so that's why

24

we're taking the time to do an RFP with this

 20
1

proposal or RFI with this proposal rather than

2

immediately scoping exactly what we want.

3

would like to hear from the community in terms

4

of what else can be done.

5

We

So, for instance, if you look at

6

some of these platform opportunities,

7

communication, big data, connectivity like Wi-Fi

8

hot spots, traffic and savings management,

9

there's things that can tie into our safety and

10

police system, public safety system, car

11

charging.

12

ideas around solar and video and things like

13

that.

So, for instance, we've seen some

14

So we'd like to evaluate all these

15

with all the relevant stakeholders and we just

16

had a kick off last week with the City at the

17

highest levels to discuss that and form a

18

working group to move that forward.

19

I think Page 20 does a good job of

20

just reviewing some of the opportunities around

21

the energy savings side which is what we expect

22

to drive the majority of the economics around

23

this, and we'll certainly be keeping our eyes

24

and ears open to respond as to the RFI that have

 21
1

good ideas that are revenue neutral in

2

particular on the platform side.

3

But I happen to know from talking to

4

some of the other -- the folks that ran some of

5

those other LED street light conversions that

6

they had huge savings, sometimes in the 70

7

percent range, 80 percent on maintenance, and so

8

you're typically seeing about 10X of upfront

9

cost of an LED bulb, but it gets replaced a

10
11

third as often and saves you a ton of energy.
So the economics are going to be

12

very, very interesting here, and we look forward

13

to getting back some responses on this.

14
15

ALDERMAN POPE:

A question or two.

First of all, I'm glad we are

16

pursuing this.

17

topics or items we discussed early on in terms

18

of pursuing because there's a potential for

19

great return.

20

This is one of the initial

But clarification, when you talk

21

about lights, you're not just talking about the

22

fixtures, you're talking about the pole, the

23

base, the structure itself?

24

MS. TRAMM:

Indeed, yes.

So we're

 22
1

going to get -- basically try and get the energy

2

savings and the operations and maintenance

3

savings to pay for as much of that overall

4

replacement to the base, the wiring, et cetera,

5

as we possibly can.

6

MR. BEITLER:

I think though before you

7

ask your next question, if you don't mind, we

8

have to be very clear in that we're not clear

9

yet how much work from an infrastructure

10

standpoint needs to be done on these lights.

11

There are some lights in some areas

12

where there may be extensive rewiring required,

13

for example, and so from an ROI standpoint, one

14

the reasons we're interested in streetlights as

15

a platform, aside from just the obvious

16

effectiveness of it, is that some of things that

17

we can utilize when we consider the streetlights

18

as a platform might generate revenue which, in

19

turn, pays for some of the infrastructure

20

upgrade that simply replacing the light bulbs

21

themselves would otherwise not sustain.

22

So it's a fairly complex formula in

23

term of being able -- the answer to your

24

question is yes, but in order to do that,

 23
1

there's a fairly complex set of formulas there.

2

ALDERMAN POPE:

On Page 18, the CITs,

3

you mentioned the BOM, the build operate manage,

4

can you clarify that or provide more

5

information, please?

6

MS. TRAMM:

Yeah.

So the build operate

7

manage contracting methodology allows us to let

8

people propose to come back with both the design

9

and structure of it as well as the operations

10

and management of say replacing the light

11

bulbs.

12

So, you know, what we're talking

13

about is figuring out how to make that work with

14

the City's already strapped labor resources

15

because there's a lot of better things we can be

16

doing with our laborer's time and there's a lot

17

of savings just on the truck rolling, so paying

18

for the truck rolling costs as well as the light

19

bulb replacement.

20

MR. BEITLER:

And again the City is

21

actually already following that routine for

22

other lighting, and this is just an extension of

23

how they're treating lighting at the moment.

24

ALDERMAN POPE:

Thank you.

 24
1
2

ALDERMAN THOMAS:
yet?

3
4

Are you on Page 21

MS. TRAMM:

I can be, yes.

Let's look

at the timeline, everyone.

5

ALDERMAN THOMAS:

Maybe go through the

6

timeline before I ask you some questions on

7

that.

8
9

MS. TRAMM:

Sure.

Absolutely.

So Page 21 just shows we've done a

10

lot of pre work on this here today.

We're

11

hoping to issue an RFI by early to mid March, as

12

soon as we're able to just finish quantifying

13

the current state of the City and the Chicago

14

Park District lighting systems so that people

15

can intelligently respond within the RFI to what

16

we currently have.

17

And then later, after we've had a

18

chance to review to over -- at least 30 days,

19

what we'll do is post it on the website and let

20

folks respond, you know, as they will, and then

21

after 30 days we'll close that request for

22

information, we'll review all -- we'll take

23

several weeks to review all that in concert with

24

the City and the Park District, and then we'll

 25
1

come up with an RFP based on what we think is

2

actually going to be -- the economics we'll work

3

on.

4

So we're taking a funneling approach

5

from the RFI to the RFP which hopefully will be

6

issued in early May.

7

ALDERMAN THOMAS:

8

Latasha Thomas, Advisory Council.

9

Okay.

Alderman

My question is actually on things

10

that appear to have been done already.

11

automatic briefing and the briefings you've had

12

with the Mayor's Office staff was just general

13

because this was only a thought?

14

MS. TRAMM:

15

ALDERMAN THOMAS:

So the

Right.
Now it seems to be

16

really in progress but the -- just clarify for

17

me what those briefings were because I don't

18

remember the in depth that we're having now.

19

MR. BEITLER:

They were general

20

briefings.

They were not specific briefings

21

about this particular project.

22

included in those briefings, but there was

23

nothing in depth about this project in those

24

presentations.

This project was

 26
1
2
3

ALDERMAN THOMAS:
just an idea?

Before today it was

It was like an idea, correct?

MR. BEITLER:

That's correct.

We have

4

had one significant meeting with the City staff

5

in terms of -- which actually occurred this past

6

week in terms of beginning this project, and

7

there were some actions that we were waiting for

8

in order to have that meeting.

9

So there was some audits being

10

conducted of the street lighting itself, and a

11

great deal of that work is now completed and

12

able to be parsed to be able to use on an

13

analytical basis which up to now we didn't have

14

that information.

15

So this particular schedule is

16

probably a tad too aggressive in terms of

17

getting everything done, but nonetheless we are

18

trying to get an RFI completed and issued in as

19

aggressive a timeline as possible.

20

TREASURER NEELY:

21
22

Treasurer Stephanie

Neely, Advisory Council.
CHAIRMAN BELL:

I think this is missing

23

a critical point.

I don't see this thing coming

24

back to the Trust Board for approval once you

 27
1

have some information around what we've dealing

2

with.

3

MR. BEITLER:

There's nothing to

4

approve at the moment.

5

significant amount of information in order to

6

structure --

7
8

We need to gather a

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Well, I understand

that.

9

MR. BEITLER:

10

Okay.

CHAIRMAN BELL:

But you got a time

11

schedule here that shows this, and I don't see a

12

time table on here to bring it back to the Trust

13

for approval of the deal.

14

MS. TRAMM:

I think that April meeting

15

would be our goal to come back and review the

16

results of the RFI and then proceed ahead with

17

the RFI after that board meeting.

18

TREASURER NEELY:

19

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Okay.

Well --

You're going to have to

20

have our approval before you go back to issue an

21

RFP, that's my point.

22

frame?

23
24

MR. BEITLER:

Where is that in the time

That would be at the

Board -- presumably at the Board meeting in

 28
1

April, that would be the time point if that's

2

not too aggressive a schedule, which it might

3

be.

4
5

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Well, I think you need

to put that on the time table.

6

MS. TRAMM:

Will do.

7

CHAIRMAN BELL:

8

MR. BEITLER:

9

TREASURER NEELY:

Thank you.

That's a critical step.

We'll do that.
And maybe my question

10

should be asked at the April meeting because I'm

11

not following the deal exactly.

12

telling me a million dollars of savings are

13

going to go to replacing, then I'm trying to

14

figure out where the economics is in the deal.

15

MR. BEITLER:

I agree.

If you're

I mean, I think

16

that we should wait.

17

There's no deal at this point.

18

other cities, what we do know from studying the

19

other cities, and we've studied a number of them

20

at this point, is that the replacement of

21

existing light bulbs with LEDs has generated

22

adequate economics to recommend going forward

23

with the replacement of the bulbs.

24

There's no economics.
Generally in

In most other analog situations, the

 29
1

only thing they've done is to replace the bulbs,

2

so we don't really have an analog in terms of

3

what happens if you're using it as a platform or

4

if you have to do significant infrastructure

5

work so there's a lot --

6

TREASURER NEELY:

I'll wait -- As the

7

Chairman said, we'll wait for the April meeting

8

to get a better sense of the deal.

9

CHAIRMAN BELL:

I just think the key

10

point is we don't know that we have a deal.

11

This is well beyond the timeline to find out

12

what the possibilities are, to package that and

13

bring it back to the Board and see if, in fact,

14

there are economics that would support going

15

forward with a deal.

16
17
18

MR. SILVERS:

This is Damon Silvers

from the Advisory Board.
In this vein, not making a comment

19

on what's been doing so far but really just

20

observing some issue that you all will face as

21

you move forward with this, it seems to me,

22

again upon very brief review of this, that the

23

basic model that you've looked at in other

24

cities appears to be not that -- in certain

 30
1

respects not that different from say the

2

retrofit project that we're already moving ahead

3

on, meaning that you basically swap out some

4

technology, you have a cost savings associated

5

with that which can be -- through creative

6

structuring can be used to finance the swap,

7

pretty simple, and relatively -- without that

8

many challenges in terms of thinking about

9

operations and public/private issues and the

10
11

like.
I think when you move to what in

12

many respects looks like a very promising idea

13

of turning streetlights into something far more

14

multidimensional that then you're going to be

15

into a different space in a lot of ways, I think

16

some of them having to do with issues of

17

financing and control, and some of them having

18

to do with, you know, which of these purposes is

19

the public going to want and where will people

20

have concerns and the like.

21

I would observe that I think it's

22

critical as you do that to envision a -- that as

23

you move ahead in that direction, and I think

24

it's a good idea to do so, that you look at how

 31
1

to ensure that ultimate control here continues

2

to reside with the public body.

3

That issue is going to come up

4

here in a much more serious way when you move to

5

this multifunctional platform than it does in

6

just a the question of swapping out the light

7

bulbs.

8
9

MR. BEITLER:

We understand and

actually we're not envisioning that control

10

would go some place else, but there's an awful

11

lot of research to do right now to just even be

12

able to make any kind of recommendations, so

13

we're just at an information gathering stage.

14

MR. SILVERS:

And I want to be clear, I

15

understand that.

You know, I think you all

16

ought to -- I think it's a very good idea in

17

general concept and ought to be explored.

18

MS. TRAMM:

19

MR. BEITLER:

20

Thank you.
Thanks, Claire.

So this takes us to transportation

21

program initiatives, and the initiative that

22

we'll be discussing today, and Nick Epstein and

23

Chris Kane will take us through this portion of

24

the presentation is on compressed natural gas.

 32
1

MR. EPSTEIN:

Hello.

So we've been

2

working for the last several months on

3

developing a plan to help enable the -- to build

4

out compressed natural gas fueling

5

infrastructure.

6

The reason why we're interested in

7

compressed natural gas, I'll skip ahead here,

8

compressed natural gas is the most price stable,

9

lowest cost transportation fuel currently

10

available.

It's about 40 percent cheaper than

11

gasoline on diesel and diesel on a gallon of

12

gasoline equivalent unit.

13

that you're transporting goods, every mile that

14

you're transporting people, you're saving

15

40 percent on the fuel costs.

So for every mile

16

It also has the largest potential of

17

displacing foreign petroleum use relative to bio

18

diesel propane as well.

19

all other alternative fuel, you see the highest

20

demand growth for CNG.

21

And it has, compared to

Despite all these positive trend

22

lines, the growth of CNG fueling stations where

23

fleets and the public can go and fuel their

24

vehicles has been stagnant for the better part

 33
1

of 20 years.

2

And just to review, CNG, it's

3

natural gas that goes through your house and

4

heats your house, and it goes through a special

5

compression process which allows it to be

6

utilized as a transportation fuel for vehicles

7

that have been equipped with on board

8

compressors, and hence then you can use it, you

9

know, as you could any other sort of

10

transportation fuel.

11

We think that again because it's so

12

much cheaper, it's a domestically produced fuel,

13

and there are, we think, strong environmental

14

benefits in terms of tail pipe pollutant

15

emissions as well as moderate greenhouse gas

16

emission reductions compared to gasoline and

17

diesel.

18

But the large issue here and why,

19

you know, we think that there's a place in the

20

Trust to get involved in this field is that

21

there's what we call a network externality or a

22

chicken and the egg problem basically.

23
24

You have CNG fueling providers who
want to build stations, they want to invest

 34
1

their money, but they won't take that risk

2

because there isn't enough fuel demand.

3

aren't enough end users who have CNG vehicles or

4

NGV to purchase the fuel, and you have end

5

users, companies with large vehicle fleets that

6

would be interested in pursing this and getting

7

the cost savings on the fuel, but they won't

8

take that risk because there aren't a network of

9

stations built along their fueling routes.

10

There

So this program is still very much

11

under development, but we are identifying all of

12

the barriers in the City of Chicago to getting

13

these stations built.

14

We think there are basically three

15

main components, a real estate component where

16

we would provide streamline service to help get

17

these stations built in terms of zoning and

18

permitting, the current process is very

19

cumbersome; a stakeholder and outreach service

20

where we would gather together fueling providers

21

and potential end users and try to get stations

22

built along fueling routes for these companies

23

in exchange for potential fueling contracts; and

24

then as well, the most developed component at

 35
1

this point is a financial model that we've

2

developed for the City of Chicago fleet where

3

they could potentially convert a number of their

4

vehicles to use natural gas as sort of the first

5

mover in this project.

6

on the financial model for sometime.

7

Chris has been working

TREASURER NEELY:

8

question.

9

again.

Just a really quick

This is Treasurer Stephanie Neely

10

MR. EPSTEIN:

Sure.

11

TREASURER NEELY:

Is there a forward

12

contract part of this at all in terms of locking

13

in natural gas prices versus or is this too

14

early to even discuss?

15

MR. EPSTEIN:

I mean, it's too early to

16

discuss, but within the CNG world, a fueling

17

provider and potential end user, you can

18

structure the contracts that way where you would

19

get a guaranteed price over a number of years

20

provided that you're purchasing a certain amount

21

of CNG fuel, so it's all on the table.

22
23
24

MR. SILVERS:

As the Treasurer said --

I'm Damon Silvers with the Advisory Board.
TREASURER NEELY:

Still.

 36
1

MR. SILVERS:

Still.

2

There's a particular issue here that

3

you all may be aware of, but I want to make sure

4

you are which is the question of whether the

5

trend line of natural gas pricing is going to

6

remain stable as natural gas prices globalize.

7

There's a very -- I mean, it's

8

unclear how much this will happen, but there's a

9

pretty serious effort underway to export from

10

the United States, and I don't think anybody

11

really knows where that leads in terms of

12

pricing, so the kind of contract that the

13

Treasurer was referring to might be very useful

14

in this environment.

15

MR. EPSTEIN:

Again we've spoken to

16

some of the largest CNG fueling providers, and

17

we've discussed this point, you know, would it

18

be possible to structure contracts where you're

19

guaranteed, you know, a price years into the

20

future, and, you know, they're very flexible.

21

It's a common method that they use for their

22

current clients with private municipal fleets.

23

TREASURER NEELY:

24

four contracts out there.

There are clearly
The question is

 37
1

what's the price.

There's a cost associated.

2

That has to be part of the economics.

3

MR. EPSTEIN:

4

TREASURER NEELY:

5

Right.
It's probably

premature.

6

MR. EPSTEIN:

Yes.

7

MR. BEITLER:

And, in fact, as we get

8

into the economic analysis, even though we don't

9

specifically answer that question, we get a

10

sense of some of the economics that we've delved

11

into at this point.

12

MR. KANE:

Good morning.

In terms of

13

how I helped Nick with his analysis is

14

essentially at a number of vehicles that the

15

City currently operates.

16

Specifically we looked at a number

17

of vehicles that the City already operates in

18

which I would call the general purpose fleet,

19

and then there was actually the police pursuit

20

cruiser fleet, and we identified just under

21

4,000 vehicles, and we did our best to run it

22

through the traps.

23

We feel that by making three changes

24

to acquisitions, fueling and a little bit of the

 38
1

maintenance provisions that the City already

2

does --

3
4
5

TREASURER NEELY:

There's no fire

equipment into that analysis at all?
MR. BEITLER:

Well, as we were doing

6

the analysis, we tried --

7

TREASURER NEELY:

Those are our most

8

expensive vehicles to run are our fire vehicles,

9

so I'm just curious as to why either those

10
11

weren't or will they be.
MR. BEITLER:

We're not looking at

12

heavy vehicles at this point from an analytical

13

standpoint.

14

portion of the vehicle fleet that would be easy

15

and lucrative to convert for the City of Chicago

16

and that would be the leader for the purpose of

17

getting a number of natural gas stations

18

deployed.

19

The initial issue was we take a

Each of the heavy vehicle

20

components, generally there are other issues

21

that surround the heavy vehicles.

22

garbage, which in many, many cities they have

23

converted to CNG garbage trucks, but how you

24

pick up garbage becomes an issue.

Like, for

 39
1

And so there's a whole lot of

2

analytical points beyond just the fleet itself

3

that become issues in doing the analysis for the

4

heavy vehicles.

5

For the light duty vehicles, you can

6

really analyze the vehicle -- light duty fleet

7

itself, and there's not a whole lot of ancillary

8

issue which was why we eventually settled on

9

light duty vehicles.

10

ALDERMAN POPE:

Steve, is this proposal

11

limited to City proper vehicles or are we

12

talking about the sister agencies like the Park

13

District, CTA, Board of Ed all of whom have a

14

fair amount of vehicles?

15

MR. BEITLER:

In theory everyone should

16

avail themselves of it.

17

was a specific component of the fleet, in this

18

case City of Chicago proper, for the purpose of

19

making a conversion which would cause a

20

significant number of stations to be built.

21

What we were looking at

Once those stations are built, then

22

we would do further outreach to the City and

23

sister agencies.

24

significant number of major corporations in the

Additionally, there are a

 40
1

City who already use CNG vehicles in other

2

cities so we would, at an initial point, do

3

outreach to those particular corporations so

4

that they would consider converting their

5

vehicles that currently are in the City of

6

Chicago to CNG so that they would begin using

7

the stations so that from the chicken and egg

8

standpoint, as more and more vehicles convert,

9

we get more and more stations, and as we get

10

more and more stations, then we can start to

11

look at the heavier vehicles, for example, and

12

get those converted.

13

ALDERMAN POPE:

And do you foresee this

14

maybe extending to being available to the

15

general public as well?

16

MR. BEITLER:

I do.

17

MR. EPSTEIN:

Yes.

18

MR. BEITLER:

So the way the stations

19

work, they are not open only to a company or a

20

city or unit of government.

21

several CNG light duty vehicles that are

22

available to the general public today and there

23

are more that are coming out.

24

In fact, there are

General Motors and Ford are all

 41
1

introducing CNG vehicles at the moment.

2

best selling pickup truck in the United States

3

which is the F150 is available as a CNG vehicle.

4

So any small business in the City that uses a

5

pickup truck could avail themselves.

6

MS. FERGUSON:

The

So are the fueling

7

stations retrofitted of existing gas stations or

8

are these greenfield newly built facilities?

9

MR. BEITLER:

Well, they could be

10

retrofitted.

11

pieces of land that the City owns that were

12

preexisting gas stations that could be

13

retrofitted for CNG purposes.

14

We have identified about a hundred

However, the way the CNG industry

15

works, in addition to dedicated stations, they

16

often just put in a pump at an existing station.

17

MS. FERGUSON:

Well, that's what I was

18

going to ask.

19

existing traditional gas station?

20

add a pump.

21

Can it be coresident with an
Can you just

So the answer to that is yes?

MR. BEITLER:

The answer is yes and

22

that's frequently how you find it.

The CNG

23

companies themselves like to build stations

24

because they want to be able to accommodate

 42
1

heavy trucks, and as we all know from pulling

2

into a gas station, most of the gas stations we

3

fill up at, there's no way that a heavy truck

4

could be accommodated at one of those, so they'd

5

have to build them specially for the purpose of

6

accommodating the heavy trucks and would do so

7

here in the City as well.

8
9

MR. RAMIREZ:

I just have a question.

This is Jorge Ramirez.

Would we be able to take

10

advantage -- I'm interested in seeing what scale

11

you could take this to.

12

We have a partnership agreement with

13

Cook County, City/County partnership.

14

County be able to avail itself of this as well

15

for their light duty vehicles as well as the

16

State even if they could?

17

MR. BEITLER:

Would the

We would hope so.

At

18

this point, however, we are doing an analytical

19

exercise.

20

receive some unsolicited proposals for this

21

particular proposal that we've been working on,

22

and when we receive those unsolicited proposals,

23

then we will analyze them in relation to the

24

program that we're establishing, and we believe

It is our expectation that we will

 43
1

that there is very, very wide applicability for

2

this particular program.

3

We are limited in terms of, you

4

know, taking a very narrow approach at the

5

moment, looking at the 4,000 or so light duty

6

vehicles because there is a payback for the City

7

of Chicago for converting those light duty

8

vehicles.

9

So the important thing for us as the

10

Trust is to work with the City to realize the

11

payback for the light duty vehicles to get this

12

program on its way, give birth to it, if you

13

will, and then having given birth to it, there

14

are many, many things that can occur.

15

There's one not-for-profit company,

16

for example, that does nothing but help

17

corporations try to convert their fleets.

18

there are plenty of folks out there that will

19

piggyback on this to help make it grow.

MR. SILVERS:

So

This is Damon Silvers.

I

just -CHAIRMAN BELL:

This is James Bell.

23

And for the interest of time to the Board and

24

the Advisory Board, this is something that is an

 44
1

interesting project that's on the drawing board

2

that has a lot of potential if we can make the

3

economics work.

4

One major issue we'll have to work

5

with is, you know, the demand versus the

6

capacity that exists today, and that's something

7

that we have yet to work through, and we have to

8

do that.

9

But this is sort of for your

10

information to let you know the things that we

11

think has application to help the City, and

12

that's something that we think will fit within

13

the Trust structure.

14

There's a lot of work yet to be

15

done.

16

been excellent things that we want to consider,

17

and I do think what we do have gets the right

18

core.

19

this project.

20
21

I know that some of the comments have

There's still a lot of work to be done on

MR. SILVERS:

This is Damon Silvers.

I would just observe about this

22

that again unlike, for example, the school

23

retrofit -- I think some of the comments have

24

been made go around this point, that this has

 45
1

revenue growth potential.

2

there's a lot of upside potentially.

3

calls for a different type of financing.

MR. BEITLER:

ALDERMAN THOMAS:

You build this and

We agree.

So it

Alderman?

He nailed it for me.

Okay.
He nailed my

question.
MR. KANE:

I guess the only thing I

10

would conclude with, if there aren't anymore

11

questions, what we're proposing, what we've

12

looked at right now is certainly not the scale

13

that maybe it could be, but we tried to just

14

limit it to what we know and right now, as we

15

see it, the perspective is that it's very

16

possible.

17

MR. BEITLER:

18

Thanks.

So at this point we will ask for

19

public comment, Mr. Chairman, and that will

20

enable us to go into executive session and not

21

have to --

22
23
24

ALDERMAN POPE:

Is there any public

comments at this time?
(No response.)

 46
1

No one has responded.

At this

2

time then we'll move forward to executive

3

session.

4

MR. BEITLER:

Basically we'll stop for

5

a moment.

We would ask the public if you could

6

please excuse us as we go into executive

7

session.

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Any other comments or

thoughts for the open meeting?
ALDERMAN POPE:
out there.

No one in the public is

They are all gone?

17

MR. BEITLER:

Yes.

18

ALDERMAN POPE:

Nothing.

19

do I have a motion to adjourn?

20

MR. RAMIREZ:

So moved.

21

MS. FERGUSON:

Second.

22

ALDERMAN POPE:

23
24

Hearing none,

All in favor?

(A chorus of ayes.)
Opposed?

(No response.)

The ayes have it.

The meeting is
