HONORABLE PLANNING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT STANDING 

RE: Request of the Downtown Development Authority in conjunction with Olympia Development of
Michigan to amend Article XVII, District Map No. 3 of Chapter 61 of the 1984 Detroit City
Code, Zoning and the provisions of the existing PD (Planning Development) zoning district
established by Ordinance 10-15 on land bounded by Woodward Ave. on the east, the south side
of Henry St. on the south, Clifford Ave. and Cass Ave. on the west and Sproat St. on the North;
and to rezone a portion of the remaining B4 (General Commercial) zoned land along the east side
of Cass Ave. between Sproat St. and Henry St., and, as well as the to-be?vacated Henry Street
right-of?way, to PD. (REQUESTING 7th EXTENSION OF REVIEW PERIOD)

On Junel 3, 2017 the Detroit City Council received and referred to the Plaruiing and Economic Development
Standing Committee the report and recommendation of the City Flaming Commission (CPC) for the above
captioned map amendment request for the Detroit Zoning Ordinance.

The Zoning Ordinance speci?es in Sec. 61-3-17, ?Where a petition for a prepared Zoning Ordinance text
or map amendment is not voted upon by the City Council within one hundred twenty days ofthe time
of receipt of the City Planning Commission ?s report, it shall be deemed to have been denied, unless extended
by the City Council. 

The original 120-day review period for this matter was to expire in October of 2017. Subsequently,
however, six extensions have been authorized with the most recent, of 120 days, being granted on March
26, 2019. On Friday, July 26, 2019 that extension will expire at day?s end.

CPC is pleased to report that the revised petition #1388 requesting the right-of-way adjustments on and
around the arena site has been processed and is awaiting the preparation of corresponding legal descriptions
in order to be completed by City Engineering. This is movement allows the necessary sequence of events
to proceed in order to facilitate the long-held PD rezoning and modi?cation. Consequently, the CPC
requests another 120-day extension of the review period to avoid having to re-start the ordinance revision
process over again at the Planning Commission. A resolution effectuating the requested extension is
attached for Your consideration. The requested extension, if granted, will expire by the close of the day
Saturday, November 23, 2019. That being on a weekend, the effective date of the expiration would be;
Monday, November 25, 2019.

Respectfully submitted,

Real Estate Insider: Eastern Market building on Russell Street to be
torn down, future plans TBD

KIRK PINHO I

11:591:1 CDNEY Isuun 
.. Hes-munANT .Kirk Pinho/Crain's Detroit Business

Sanford Nelson plans to tear this Eastern Market building down although a timeframe for that and what will replace it have yet to be determined.

A 15,000-square-foot property along Eastern Market's main drag is not long for this world.

1/11

7/10/2019 Printable
However, just how long remains for what Sanford Nelson refers to as "Building No. i" at 2701
Russell St. is not known. Nor is what will take its place.

But Nelson who has sparked controversy and debate in the city's food district since
starting a real-estate buying spree more than two years ago with the $1.3 million purchase
of the 2701 Russell property and his investors say it's time to turn over a new leaf.

One part of that includes inviting public input on what should replace the Russell Street
building.

Nelson, the son of serial entrepreneur Linden Nelson, says those interested can email
with the subject line ?2701 Russell Street" and offer their suggestions.

?We haven't given the community the opportunity to engage and give input on how to
preserve and renew Eastern Market, and that starts now and we want to kick it off with this
property," Nelson said, sitting at a picnic table in a new park area with art installations, a
mural and four topiary installations: a dragon, a horse, an elephant and a bear.

Kirk Pinho/Crain's Detroit Business

This topiary dragon is part of a new public park that was created in Eastern Market immediately north of Bert's Warehouse on Russell Street.

"We want your input and here is how you can give it. We plan to host meetings and we want
to listen.?

On Monday afternoon, sat with Nelson and Marvin Beatty, who is among Nelson's
investment partners, in the park just north of the building they own that houses Bert's
Warehouse.

(Bert Dearing, the mainstay's owner, stopped by to say hello to his landlords in the park area.
?Three months ago, this was an eyesore," he said of the property. Nelson and Beatty said it
coSt more than $100,000 to convert it into the new space.)

It's the site that had been targeted for new mixed-use development with 79 units by Joey
Jonna of Birmingham before Nelson bought it as part of his spending spree that has resulted
in a roughly 20-building, Eastern Market real estate portfolio.

3/11

7110/2019 Printable

The property that Nelson's Detroit?based Firm Real Estate wants to demolish is actually four
buildings, including that one that houses Mike Coney Island. Mike wouldn't say much about
his future plans when I talked with him brie?y this morning as he cooked for a patron, but he
said the space has been a restaurant, although not under his ownership, for decades.

plan to close the restaurant and start a new business somewhere else," he said in a text
message this afternoon after this story published, noting that he "was busy and couldn't
really talk.?

want to be out of the restaurant business and do something different. This is my own
decision and has nothing to do with being forced to close. I have had great communications
with the Nelsons. They treat me fair.?

There are three buildings that line Russell Street and one that has Division Street frontage
and that spans north to an alley. Nelson says the four foundations are in poor condition, and
a wall is buckling.

"Not all four buildings were built at the same time, but they are all very old. You have four
different foundations that are all compromised. They have varying degrees of deterioration,"
he said. ?It would be one thing if it was one foundation in one building. You could repair that.
But here, you have basement in parts and not in the other."

Beatty said that whatever takes its place will be done deliberately and with input from the
community.

"We would much prefer to structure whatever we do with a plan, not just throwing shit
against a wall and trying to figure out how people are going to react to it," Beatty said. "For us,
the best thing to do is to plan something, to structure something that we think will work for
the entire community.?

What ultimately ends up at that site will be the byproduct of lots of discussion and ideas,
Beatty said.

?By that time (that community meetings start), we'll have some conceptual understanding or
conceptual idea of what we want to put here. Like any development, it's like a horse that
started out before the committee and ended up as a camel," Beatty said.

Indeed.

Nelson's tenure as a landlord in Detroit has been bumpy to date, almost a year after I first
wrote about him.

Concerns about rising rents have prompted backlash over fear that the eclectic food district
will lose some of its identity as a go-to spot for affordable space for artists and small
businesses. Several have closed or are leaving under Nelson's ownership, including Russell
Street Deli and Mootown Ice Cream Dessert Shoppe LLC, but he is also bringing in new
restaurants, like Jose's Tacos.

He said he is aware of the concerns, as well as some of the criticism and name-calling he
has taken in the media and elsewhere, including a meme featuring Photoshopped chain
restaurant logos onto the key Russell Street building that houses/housed Supino
Pizza/Mootown/Russell Street (to close in Coney Island.

For Firm Real Estate, he says, "renewal" in Eastern Market "is when you are building new
construction and when you are attracting new businesses to make sure that it is within the
character that makes Eastern Market unique. It's not chain restaurants."

I made a remark about the meme.

"Well, i wonder, 10 years from now, when those (chain) businesses are not in those buildings,
what will the fans of those memes say? But i cannot predict the futUre. It's building buildings
that fit within the scale and feel of the market," Nelson said.

He is just one of a new corps of landlords swooping into Eastern Market and buying property
in the country's oldest food district, but he has by far attracted the most attention even
though others have done nothing of note with their properties so far for a variety of reasons.

Others include Detroit developers and economic development professionals Roger
Basmajian and George Jackson and New York City-based developer ASH NYC, replacing the
street-level business operators in Eastern Market that traditionally owned their own
properties (and sometimes others).

According to Dan Carmody, president of Eastern Market Partnership, some existing
businesses have expressed concerns about rent increases as the new landlord crop pours
money into improving the district's older buildings. Part ofthat concern arises because the
space has been comparatively inexpensive for decades, Carmody said in October.

"The previous landlords came up in an age where having a warm body and somebody paying
any kind of rent was an advantage over having vacant space,? he said.

5/11

7/10/2019 Printable

Nelson said Monday that eight of his buildings are currently under renovation, and that work
on the Supino/Russell Street Deli/Mootown/Zeff's building should be done in about a month.

Nelson has said that rents in his properties will be "market rate" and has previously said that
he plans on carving out affordable space for artists and food users as his overall vision for
his portfolio progresses.

Cass/Can?eld land value jumps
A 1.5?acre property that is being proposed to (some day) house a new mixed-use

development has grown?3.47 percent in value since a March 2018 appraisal, according to
Wayne State University, which owns the land.

University spokesman Matt Lockwood says a May 28 appraisal values the property at Cass
Avenue and Can?eld Street at $5.658 million, up from $5.468 million appraisal 16 months
ago. I wrote about that appraisal in this space in April.

asked for a copy of the most recent appraisal but have not yet received it.

The Vernor, the proposed mixed-use development on the property by Detroit-based Broder 
Sachse Real Estate Services Inc., has faced an uphill climb.

I reported in August that Wayne State was considering scrapping the project. However, a
board of governors document for the body's June 21 meeting agenda says that the
university and Broder Sachse are "currently negotiating a purchase agreement and related
documents" relative to the 1.5 acres.

The Vernor site had been planned for 248 apartments, a 120-room hotel, 19,000 square feet
of retail and a BOO-person conference center after awarding an April 2013 request for
proposals to Broder Sachse and entering into a memorandum of understanding for the $60
million project with the developer in November 2013.

Instead of apartments, the plan has now shifted toward one with about 100 condos and a
boutique hotel with 130 to 150 rooms.

The property would have originally been leased to Broder Sachse, but would be sold to the
company underthe condo plan. That's because projects are completed using master deeds,
and individual units are then sold to buyers; if Broder Sachse leased the land, it would
eventually return to the university at the end of that agreement.

RE: Report on Demolition Management Agreement between the City of Detroit

and the Detroit Building Authority

The Legislative Policy Division (LPD) has reviewed the proposed Demolition Management
Agreement (the Agreement) between the City of Detroit (City) and the ?Detroit Building
Authority (DBA) dated August 18, 2019. The Agreement is a continuation of the current
Demolition Management Agreement with the DBA containing many of the same terms and

conditions. This report highlights pertinent provisions of the new Agreement.

LPD notes that the existing Demolition Management Agreement dated August 11, 2015, is set to
expire on or around August 11, 2019. The current agreement has a term of three (3) years and
will expire on or around August 18, 2022, unless terminated by the parties as set forth under

Section 7.1

The document provides that the recitals have been incorporated within the terms and conditions
of the Agreement. The underlying purpose of both the prior and current Agreement is stated in

the second ?Whereas?, which provides:

WHEREAS, the City desires to continue utilizing the professional services of the
DBA to coordinate and implement the Demolition Program in accordance with

the terms of this Agreement;

 

1 Section 7 Term, provides that the Agreement can be terminated by both parties in whole or in part by agreeing in
writing thirty (3 0) days before the effective termination date, or by either party terminating in whole or in part by
giving written notice to the other party at least one (1) year before the termination date in the manner set forth in

Subsection 7A and 7B.

The provision identi?es that the DBA will coordinate and implement the Demolition Program.
The ?rst ?Whereas? broadly de?nes the Demolition Program as the ?City?s demolition program
for the demolition of certain residential and commercial improvements situated on property in
the City of Detroit?.2 LPD notes the signi?cance of this de?nition as it includes any residential
or commercial property within the City of Detroit identi?ed by the City to be in need of
demolition. This would also include the thousands of residential properties owned by the Detroit
Land Bank Authority or any other persons or entities.

Section 3D of the Agreement provides the method the City approved expenditures (including but
not limited to administrative fees) in carrying out its Program Manager functions for the
Demolition Program shall be paid by the City to the DBA. It provides in pertinent part:

The City is hereby authorized under this Agreement to pay such DBA Cost up to
the amounts that are budgeted by the City in both Appropriation 20253, Non-
Departmental Blight Remediation and Appropriation 00277, Non-Departmental
Detroit Building Authority, or any other Appropriation established for this
purpose (together the ?Funds?), for each respective City of Detroit ?scal year of
this Agreement.3

The Agreement under Section 3D authorizes the City to utilize general fund dollars or any other
appropriation established for the purpose ?funds? to cover the cost of managing the Demolition
Program that are appropriated by City Council for each ?scal during the term of the Agreement.4

The Agreement provides that any contractor or subcontractor contracted by the City shall
indemnify the City and the comply with the bonding requirements outlined in the
Demolition Policies and Procedures manualS; and comply with the insurance requirements
outlined in Subsection 3F. The contractors selected to participate in the Demolition Program will
be procured by the City?s O-CFO, Of?ce of Contracting and Procurement.

The Agreement provides that it is the duty of the Housing and Revitalization Department (HRD)
to facilitate the payments to contractors; ensure all federal sources used for the Demolition
Program are used for eligible purposes; coordinate the City?s compliance with Section 3 of the
Housing and Community Development Act of 1968; pay BSEED from the ?Funds? all initial

 

2 The prior Demolition Management Agreement also de?ned the Demolition Program as ?the City?s plan for the
demolition of certain residential and commercial improvements situated on property in the City of Detroit.

3 The Fiscal Year 2019-2020, budget for Appropriation 20253, Non-Departmental Blight Remediation for
demolition is approximately $41,086,976 and for Appropriation 00277, Non?Departmental Detroit Building
Authority for blight and DBA of?ce is approximately $3,749,532.

4 LPD notes the appropriated funds would include not only general fund dollars that are appropriated for Blight
Remediation as well as appropriations speci?cally designated to the DBA, but also any appropriated Fire Escrow, or
Community Development Block Grant dollars. LPD further notes that the use of these dollars under the Demolition
Program as de?ned may include the use of general fund dollars for DLBA owned properties, particularly once
Hardest Hit Fund dollars have been expended under the Federal and State program.

5 The City?s Demolition Policies and Procedures manual is incorporated in the Agreement as Exhibit A, dated June
2019. The manual provides all the rules and procedural requirements for demolition activity including but not
limited to: bonding requirements for contractors; noti?cation to residents regarding the removal of hazardous
material such as asbestos; procedures for removal of hazardous materials; procedures to minimize fugitive dust (dual
hose spraying during demolition; inspection procedures for demolition and back?ll of structure, and requirements
for back?ll material.

permit cost associated with residential demolition as well as hydrant permit fees related to the

The Agreement provides that BSEED duties shall include but is not limited to: identify
properties for emergency demolition; conduct inspections; verify property conditions and
ownership; co-ordinate dangerous building designations and demolitions orders; issue demolition
permits and conduct inspections related to demolitions; release any available ?re escrow funding
available for any property to be demolished to offset the cost of abatement and demolition in
accordance with state law.

The Agreement provides that the DBA shall serve as Program Manager to manage and
coordinate the performance of Contractors engaged by the City to implement the Demolition
Program; develop a demolition strategy and estimate the funding needed; obtain written approval
from the City for any change orders recommended by the DBA prior to the start of any change
order work being done; utilize the fee schedule provided in the City?s Demolition Policies and
Procedures manual when providing estimates to the City for any demolition related activity
and/or change order request under the Demolition Program; prepare an Annual Demolition
Report; and co-operate with the city?s Inspector General in any investigation regarding the
Agreement and/or the Demolition Program.

The Agreement provides under Section 5, that it shall become effective on the date it is ?led with
the Michigan Secretary of State. The DBA is responsible for ?ling the Agreement with the State.

The Agreement provides under Section 6, that to the greatest extent feasible, lower-income
residents of the City shall be given opportunities for training and employment as well as eligible
business located in or owned in substantial part by persons residing in the city shall be awarded
contracts in connection with the Demolition Program. The Agreement further provides that the
City and the DBA shall make positive efforts to utilize Detroit Certi?ed businesses and
small/minority/women? owned enterprises as sources of supplies and services needed for the
Demolition Program.

Section 15H provides that the Agreement has no force or effect unless and until it has been fully
executed by the City, including but not limited to approval by resolution of the Detroit City
Council. Any amendments or modi?cations to the Agreement must be approved as set forth
therein including approval by City Council.

If we can be of further assistance please call upon us.
