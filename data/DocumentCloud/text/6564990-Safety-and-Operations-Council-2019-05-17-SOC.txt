Ms. Moening stated that staff will continue to provide SOC with updates on SRTS planning
initiatives.
ITS Architecture Update and Strategic Plan
Ms. Moening stated that two surveys for the ITS update were distributed in September 2018 to
over 150 stakeholders throughout the NOACA region. The first survey focused on transportation
needs and challenges; and the second survey focused on understanding each agency’s
capabilities and plans for future ITS deployments. In addition, stakeholder workshops were held
to provide local agencies with a better understanding of ITS, and for the project team to learn
more about local needs and capabilities.
Ms. Moening reviewed the top needs identified for ITS solutions and the project schedule for the
ITS Architecture comprehensive update. She stated that as the project team continues to develop
the components of the ITS architecture, sections will be shared with the stakeholder group via
email to confirm that ITS needs are accurately summarized and that existing and planned systems
are identified and mapped to the regional architecture. Ms. Moening noted that a second series
of stakeholder workshops are planned for early May. She stated that the final draft of the ITS
Architecture update and Strategic Plan are expected to be completed by the end of July.

 Ms. Moening stated that staff and the consultant team will work with ITS stakeholders at all levels
to the ITS Architecture update and Strategic Plan.
Signal Timing and Optimization Program (STOP) Update
Ms. Moening stated that the following corridors were evaluated in Part I of the STOP contract:
•

The first corridor is SOM Center Road in the cities of Eastlake, Willoughby, and Willoughby
Hills in Lake County. The consultant evaluated 21 traffic signals on SOM Center Road
and at intersections immediately adjacent to the corridor.

•

The second corridor is West 150th Street / Warren Road in the cities of Lakewood,
Cleveland, and Brook Park. The consultant evaluated 28 traffic signals.

Ms. Moening reviewed the work that has been done on the two corridors. She stated that signal
timings in both corridors were estimated to reduce a total of 6,600 metric tons of CO2 for a savings
of nearly 750,000 gallons of fuel and eliminate 730,000 hours of travel delay for motorists over
the next five years.
Ms. Moening stated that the Chester Avenue corridor was selected for Part II of the STOP
contract. She said the work includes a total of 66 traffic signals on Chester Avenue and Euclid
Avenue to University Circle. Ms. Moening stated that Part II of the contract will be completed
using CMAQ funds allocated in the FY 2019 Overall Work Program (OWP).
Ms. Moening stated that staff will work with the local communities and the consultant team to
implement Part II of the STOP contract.
Mr. Joseph Beno stated that the City of Lakewood received CMAQ funds a few years ago for work
done on the east/west section of the Warren Road/150th Street corridor. The City is now working
on the north/south section of the corridor. He asked if the evaluation of Warren Road interfered
with Lakewood’s signal timing project.
Mr. Randy Lane stated that he did not have that information on hand, but would get back to
Mr. Beno with an answer.
ODOT Safety Calendar Update
Ms. Moening stated that the following safety campaigns will happen throughout April 2019:

PPR is a Board resolution that certifies that the project has had thorough review, allowing the project to
proceed to the programming stages of the planning process.
As part of the PPR process, a detailed summary of the proposed improvement and staff and committee
assessment of the project are posted on NOACA’s website, www.NOACA.org. A link to the PPRs is
included on the home page by clicking the ‘Comment on Projects’ button. Staff adds comments obtained
from the public, governmental organizations and NOACA committees as they are received. Proposed
projects are posted on the website for three months, allowing adequate time for review and comment.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Pending Board approval, the project sponsor will be notified that their project has completed PPR. NOACA
staff will work with the project sponsor to address any planning issues identified during PPR.

Reconstruction of SR-43 in Solon
History/Background: These projects are included in ODOT District 12’s Program.
Title: Reconstruction of SR-43 in Solon
Sponsor: City of Solon
Estimated Total Cost: $8,107,165
Proposed Source of Federal Funds: ODOT
History/Background: The Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) Safety program
provides funds to ODOT and local governments for highway safety treatments or corrective
activity designed to alleviate a safety problem or a potentially hazardous situation. The program
is funded at approximately $100 million annually. Priority is given to those projects with
recommended activities/countermeasures that improve safety at roadway locations with a high
frequency, severity, and rate of crashes.
There are two application cycles per year. Applications must be signed off by the respective
ODOT District Safety Review Team. A safety engineering study must typically accompany the
application unless the application is for preliminary engineering funds to complete the study.
Proposed Project: The following project was selected for Highway Safety Improvement
Program (HSIP) funding:
•

CUY SR-43 - 1.98: PID No. 109517 - This project involves reconstruction and widening
of SR-43 (Aurora Road), from 2 lanes to 3 lanes, from the Solar Shopping Center, 0.13
mile east of SR-91 (SOM Center Road) to Liberty Road, in Solon (schematic). The
scope will also include a new water line, storm sewer, a permanent traffic signal at Portz
Parkway, a multipurpose path on the south side of Aurora Road and an on-street bike
lane on the north side with new sidewalks. Right turn lanes will be installed at Clearwater
Court, Portz Parkway and the Liberty Road.
The project’s estimated total cost is $8,107,605. The estimated cost of preliminary
engineering preliminary development (PEPD) is $64,974. The estimated cost of
preliminary engineering detailed design (PEDD) is $11,466. The PEPD and PEDD will
be funded by ODOT. The estimated cost of right-of-way (RW) is $450,000. The RW will
be funded with local funds ($450,000). The estimated cost of construction (CO) is
$7,091,165. The CO will be funded with HSIP funds ($1,500,000) and local funds
($5,591,165). The estimated cost of construction engineering (CE) is $490,000. The CE
will be locally funded.

Staff Comment (Summary):
RECOMMENDATION:
o Level 2 of NOACA Freight Network, meaning relatively high truck counts. Design should
consider their turning movements mainly at the shopping center.

RE:

ITS Architecture Update and Strategic Plan

ACTION REQUESTED
No action is requested at this time. This item is for information and presentation only.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION
In fiscal year 2018, NOACA entered into an 18-month contract with AECOM to perform a comprehensive
update of the regional Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) architecture and its strategic plan. NOACA
last updated the regional ITS architecture in 2010. The purpose of the ITS architecture is to support
interoperability among ITS systems and jurisdictions, and to ensure that ITS elements of projects proposed
in the region are eligible for federal funding. In conjunction with the update of the regional architecture,
NOACA is also updating the region’s ITS strategic plan. The strategic plan identifies needs for ITS-related
infrastructure improvements and establishes the time frames for their implementation.
On April 29, drafts of the ITS Architecture and Strategic Plan were sent to the stakeholder group for review
and comment, prior to the second round of ITS workshops, scheduled for May 7th, 8th, and 9th. At these
workshops, the project team will meet with attendees to review the components of the ITS architecture, to
confirm that identified needs are accurately captured and addressed, to verify that planned and potential
future improvements are included in the ITS strategic plan, and to review how to use the architecture in project
planning. The workshops are an important part of the communication and engagement plan to keep
stakeholders informed about intelligent transportation systems and their implementation in the NOACA region.
A project website has been created to store all project materials for information and reference by ITS
stakeholders, including the drafts the ITS Architecture and Strategic Plan. The website can be found at this
link.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Project Budget as contained in the Fiscal Year 2018 Overall Work Program and Budget is $205,399.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS

Transportation Systems Management and Operations (TSMO) is a set of integrated strategies to optimize
the performance of operations on existing infrastructure through implementation of multimodal and
intermodal, cross-jurisdictional systems, services, and projects designed to preserve capacity and improve
security, safety, and reliability of a transportation system.
Improving institutional capability and business process is necessary to improve implementation of TSMO
strategies. The Strategic Highway Research Program 2 (SHRP2) recognized this need and created the
institutional architectures for TSMO as part of the L06 project. Building on SHRP2 results, American
Association of State Highways and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) has continued development of this
concept and a capability maturity concept was published as part of the TSMO guidance. SHRP2
Implementation activities have successfully used the overall framework to work with State DOTs to develop
action plans to improve their TSMO capabilities.
A workshop on was held on March 14 to further develop an enhance TSMO business processes in Northeast
Ohio. The workshop, sponsored by FHWA and conducted by AASHTO, is designed to:
• Educate participants on tools and resources for improving TSMO business processes; and
Engage participants in collaboratively developing a business process for managing arterials during
freeway incidents.
The workshop was attended by NOACA, ODOT TSMO coordinators, ODOT maintenance managers, OSP,
as well as local police, fire, service and engineering departments. Local agencies who attended included
Avon, Sheffield Village, Elyria, Garfield Heights, Independence, Valley View.

 Improving Business Processes for More Effective TSMO

NOACA Business Process Diagram for Improving Arterial Management during Freeway Incidents
This business process diagram shows an approach for improving arterial management during freeway incidents.
• Initial policy and organizational activities take place involving meetings to identify possible solutions based on available resources, establish agreements, and address gaps.
• The specific process includes arterial management coordination that occurs alongside existing incident management and traveler information activities. Specifically, a traffic
overseer may be identified to facilitate a coordinated response, assign resources, and monitor ongoing impacts to modify the response, as needed.
• The business process is periodically reviewed and updated based on after-action reviews and available performance measures.

1) Needed resources may involve new technologies like gates or upgraded signal controllers, for example.
2) Available resources may include intelligent transportation systems (ITS) and staff who can provide assistance by managing traffic and closures, e.g. sharing data and
cameras, accessing controllers to implement alternate signal timing plan on-site or remotely, truck-mounted dynamic message sign.
3) The Traffic Overseer will be the incident commander initially, then may be delegated to another person able to coordinate a multi-jurisdictional response at the local level,
e.g. police supervisor, road/signal manager, or ODOT manager.
5 - 11 detour signs,
4) Arterial response will vary based on available staff and technologies, and could include remote or on-site traffic signal timing adjustments, deploying incident

Safety Funding Applications for April 30 Funding Cycle

ACTION REQUESTED
No action is requested at this time. This item is for information and presentation only.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION
The Ohio Department of Transportation dedicates about $102 million annually for engineering improvements
at high-crash and severe-crash locations – one of the largest state investments in the nation. This funding is
available to ODOT staff and local governments, and it can be used to make improvements on any public
roadway.
ODOT funds a mix of spot safety projects, such as intersection and curve realignment, and systematic safety
treatments, such as edge line rumble stripes and cable barrier, which can be installed across hundreds of
miles. Funding requests typically range from $200,000 to $5 million, though the department will consider
funding requests up to $10 million. Funding is available for all stages of development and typically requires a
minimum 10% local match. Safety improvements, such as upgrading signs, signals, pavement markings and
guardrail are eligible for 100% funding.
ODOT accepts applications twice a year, with deadlines of April 30 and September 30. Applications must be
reviewed by the local District Office before they are submitted to Central Office. The department encourages
project sponsors to coordinate with the local District Office at least 12 weeks in advance of these deadlines –
though more time will likely be necessary for complex projects (e.g. interchange modification, corridor,
TWLTL), which require additional reviews. Early coordination with the local District Office is essential to
developing a realistic timeline for submitting an application.
Applications are reviewed by multi-disciplinary committees in the District and Central Office. The committees
have expertise in safety analysis, roadway design, traffic engineering and highway maintenance. These
committees evaluate investments based on factors such as crash analysis; statewide, regional or local priority;
matching funds; and cost/benefit analysis. The committee reviews about 70 applications per year requesting
more than $150 million.
5 - 13

 Project sponsors are encouraged to examine a full range of options starting with low-cost strategies, such as
new signs, pavement markings and guardrail to mid-cost strategies such as new traffic signals, turn lanes
and road realignments. Higher-cost projects, such as corridor improvements to arterial roads and interchange
reconfigurations, may be considered up to $10 million. Funding can be paired with other sources.
ODOT District 3 and District 12 have communicated to NOACA that seven projects have applied for Safety
funds in the April 30 funding cycle. These projects are briefly identified as follows, presented in order of total
project cost:

RE:

ODOT/OSHP Safety Calendar

ACTION REQUESTED
No action is requested at this time. This item is for information and presentation only.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION
The Ohio Traffic Safety Office (OTSO) and ODOT work together to develop a rolling calendar of safety
campaign messaging to raise public awareness on specific emphasis areas and initiatives promoted by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Typically these campaigns involve messaging
pushed out via social media and press releases, supported with messaging by ODOT on freeway message
boards, and often coupled with increased enforcement. The full OTSO safety calendar may be viewed on
their website at this link.
NOACA supports the outreach efforts of these agencies by reinforcing messages issued through its Office of
External Relations.
Upcoming events prior to next Safety and Operations Council meetings are as follows:
• Month of May: Motorcycle Safety Awareness Month
• Months of April and May: Enforcement Blitz (Prom Season)
• May 14-June 3: Seatbelt Use (Click It or Ticket)
• June 18: Motorcycle Safety (National Ride to Work Day)
• July 1-5: Impaired Driving (Fourth of July Holiday)
• August: Back to School Month
• August 15-September 3: National Enforcement Crackdown (Impaired Driving)
Continuing support of education and outreach programs is necessary to make and continue positive changes
in behavior of the traveling public. At the national level, significant reductions have been made in reducing
the rate of fatalities for unbelted motorists (reduced from 54% to 48% between 2007 to 2016) and alcoholimpaired driving fatalities (reduced from 32% to 28% between 2007 to 2016); however, both emphasis areas
still comprise a large fraction of all crash fatalities. (Source: Terry Shelton, Associate Administrator, National
Center for Statistics and Analysis, “2016 Fatal Crash Overview” presented on December 14, 2017.)

 FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Agencies within the NOACA region are encouraged to assist the Ohio Traffic Safety Office with maximizing
impact of statewide message campaigns by cross-promoting these messages at the community level.
