GENERAL BACKGROUND
The CHA’s current contracts for employee healthcare plan benefits with Blue Cross Blue Shield and
Guardian Life Insurance Company of America will terminate on December 31st, 2015, and must be
replaced on January 1st, 2016. These coverages are placed through Mesirow Financial, CHA’s broker of
record for employee benefit plans. The US Department of Housing and Urban Development has
previously authorized the CHA to utilize a broker to procure its insurance coverages by soliciting
competitive insurance bids on behalf of CHA.

 PROCUREMENT HISTORY
Mesirow Financial (“Mesirow”), the CHA’s insurance broker for Employee Health Plan Benefits, directly
solicited requests for coverage from 9 health insurance providers, for Medical, Dental, and Vision
coverages. Bids for Life AD&D, Retiree Life, Short Term Disability, and Long Term Disability were not
solicited as the Board has previously authorized option years 2015 and 2016, which were guaranteed
rates. Bids for the administration of Flexible Spending Accounts were also solicited.
All contracts referenced herein are considered firm fixed rate contracts, with contract amounts
calculated based on the employee census count and/or participation in the plan.
COST ANALYSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
MEDICAL INSURANCE COST ANALYSIS AND RECOMMENDATION
Incumbent insurer BCBS was asked to quote as expiring for the employee census base of 411 (versus 420
in 2015). BCBS offered coverage consistent with the previous year’s program at $6,087,990, a decrease
of 5.87% over the prior year’s premium. The average expected increase of health insurance costs for midand large-sized businesses in 2016 is expected to be between 6% – 10%. A major factor in the premium
decrease is the Authority’s now favorable claims history, which improved to 65% for CY2014. The insurer’s
target loss ratio is approximately 85%.
The Authority received three bids from competing insurers, with one declination from new Illinois insurer,
Land of Lincoln. United Healthcare quoted the program at $6,925,715, equivalent to 13.8% higher than
the BCBS option. Humana offered to provide coverage at $7,042,888, or 15.7% higher than the
incumbent’s renewal bid. Aetna quoted $7,176,789, which is 17.9% higher than the incumbent’s renewal
proposal. The premium is inclusive of all Healthcare Reform taxes and fees.
We recommend that the Authority-offered health insurance coverage remain consistent with the prior
year. The renewal premium is calculated at $6,087,990, based on an estimated employee census of 411
participants. Should the participation levels fluctuate, the expense would change proportionately.
DENTAL INSURANCE COST ANALYSIS AND RECOMMENDATION
Bids were solicited from three dental insurers. Guardian, our current insurer, quoted $287,239, with no
increase over the expiring premium. Humana offered coverage at $254,736, which is 15.5% lower than
Guardian. Aetna offered coverage at $262,736, or 15% less than Guardian. Delta Dental quoted a
premium of $272,611, or 9.6% less than Guardian. Assurant quoted $283,236, or 6% less than the
renewal quote from Guardian’s quote. However, each of these insurers offer less coverage for employees,
which is reflected in the cost. Additionally, each has varying participation requirements that could
adversely affect rates should the minimum not be met. Therefore, Guardian is the recommended provider
for Dental coverage at an estimated premium of $287,239.
VISION INSURANCE COST ANALYSIS AND RECOMMENDATION
Incumbent Vision insurance provider agreed to a rate lock during last year’s renewal period, and therefore
this coverage was not marketed. The incumbent insurer Davis has more participating vendors than other
insurers, and coverage offered is better than other insurers, as copays are lower for every covered service.
Davis Vision offered coverage at a decrease of 9.8%, equating to $40,360.

 LIFE, AD&D, RETIREE LIFE, STD and LTD COST ANALYSIS AND RECOMMENDATION
Bids for Life, AD&D, Retiree Life, Short Term Disability, and Long Term Disability were not solicited as the
Board has previously authorized option years 2015 and 2016, which were guaranteed NTE rates. Based
on the current employee census covering eligible participants and affiliates, the anticipated expense is
$238,493 for these coverages. Premiums are based on employee salary and age, and are therefore
variable and expected to increase slightly over time.
LONG TERM CARE
Long term care coverage has been provided as a benefit to CHA employees for over a decade. This
coverage provides payment for employees who become disabled and are no longer able to provide basic
care for themselves. Our current insurer, Unum, has requested a rate revision from the State of
Illinois. Unum must now revise/increase their rates to keep pace with increasing cost of care; rates have
not changed since program inception in 2004.
Premiums could increase by 75% or more, from
approximately $37,400 to $65,500. Alternate options available in the marketplace are expected to be
more expensive than the current plan with the rate increase. While marketing efforts are still being
conducted for this coverage, it is recommended to authorize the expenditure NTE $70,000.
FLEXIBLE SPENDING ADMINISTRATION
Four providers quoted the flexible spending account administrative service, including the incumbent
AmeriFlex. This service coordinates employee pre-tax set aside dollars for medical and transit expense.
The incumbent, AmeriFlex, offers the lowest rate structure with no set up fees, with an estimated expense
of $11,551.
