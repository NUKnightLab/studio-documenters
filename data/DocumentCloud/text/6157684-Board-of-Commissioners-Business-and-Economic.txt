WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners on April 17, 2013 approved a Resolution authorizing the

WHEREAS, this financing will provide Cook County (County) through the Bureau of Economic Development
with the lending authority to support sustainable economic development for the benefit of low- and moderateincome individuals; and

(CDBG) program and is subject to the requirements governing the CDBG program; and
WHEREAS, it is permissible for Section 108 recipients to impose fees on third party borrowers who receive loans
made with the proceeds of Section 108 loans; and
WHEREAS, if the purpose of the fees is to defray costs related to administering aspects of a Section 108 project,
the fee should be treated as an applicable credit against administrative costs; and
WHEREAS, it is permissible by HUD that the County collect an application processing fee of $500.00 or $1,000.00
to defray the administrative costs of processing a Section 108 application and such fee will be treated as an
applicable credit against administrative costs; and
WHEREAS, it is permissible by HUD for Cook County to charge third party borrowers an interest rate that is
higher than the rate payable on the Section 108 loan (interest rate spread) and HUD encourages Section 108
recipients to use the interest rate spread as a reserve for interest rate fluctuations; and
Page 6 of 8

 WHEREAS, it is permissible by HUD that the County charge a 2 - 3% loan commitment, a portion of which will
