PROPOSED RESOLUTION
CALLING FOR A PUBLIC HEARING ON MONETARY BOND
WHEREAS, Illinois’ Bail Statute, 725 ILCS 5/110-1, et seq, mandates that the amount of bail shall be
considerate of the financial ability of the accused; and
WHEREAS, a class action lawsuit was filed on October 14, 2016 alleging that pre-trial detainees are
detained at Cook County jail solely because they are unable to pay the amount of money fixed as a
financial condition of their release; and
WHEREAS, the class action lawsuit also alleges that reliance on monetary bond results in a disparate
impact on African Americans that constitutes illegal race discrimination in violation of the Illinois Civil
Rights Act; and
WHEREAS, Cook County jail receives over 70,000 admissions every year; and
WHEREAS, 8,248 individuals were being detained at Cook County Jail as of October 17, 2016; and
WHEREAS, Cook County spends $330 million yearly to maintain jail operations; and

crime and are awaiting a trial; and
WHEREAS, the average length of stay in Cook County jail is 59 days; and
WHEREAS, 271 individuals were detained solely due to their inability to post a bond of $1,000 or less
as of October 17, 2016; and
WHEREAS, 1,024 “turnarounds” were held in Cook County jail last year - individuals who spent so
much time in custody that, once they were sentenced to state prison, they already had served every day of
their prison sentence, on average each serving 2½ months of extra time; and
WHEREAS, a 2013 evaluation of Cook County Criminal justice data showed that 63% of detainees are
unable to post bond; and

treatment; and
WHEREAS, studies have shown that pre-trial detention is more expensive than the pre-trial supervision
programs that allow individuals to return to their communities and continue working; and
WHEREAS, judges have the discretion to set bond based on individual factors and these decisions
determine whether an individual will remain in the community and continue to work and attend school,
or remain incarcerated; and
WHEREAS, judges are required by the Code of Criminal Procedure to consider more than 30 statutory
factors pertaining to the nature of the charge(s) against the defendant, his or her criminal history, prior
instances of failure to appear, and the defendant's home and community information, such as place of
residence, family ties, employment, education, character, and mental condition; and
WHEREAS, judicial decisions on bonds and release conditions varies considerably by judge; and
WHEREAS, judges spend approximately 37 seconds and sometimes as few as 10 seconds listening to
information on the charged arrest and any mitigating factors before determining bond; and
WHEREAS, as a matter of practice, judges impose financial conditions without making an inquiry into
and findings concerning a defendant’s ability to pay the amount ordered; and
WHEREAS, the average bond amounts set by judges are out of reach for the majority of pre-trial
detainees; and

4 felony were released on bond, while 32.4% of non-African Americans charged with a Class 4 felony
were released on bond; and
WHEREAS, other jurisdictions, such as Washington D.C., have successfully ended the reliance on
monetary bond and have established non-monetary alternatives; and
WHEREAS, a number of other jurisdictions do not detain arrestees prior to trial solely on lack of ability
to pay and instead employ pre-trial supervision programs that often achieve court-appearance rates of
over 90%; and
WHEREAS, mounting research has shown alternatives to detention such as text message reminder
systems, drug and mental health treatment, unsecured bond and supervised release successfully ensure
future court appearances; and

WHEREAS, in Washington, D.C., where nearly 90 percent of defendants are released without monetary

WHEREAS, a 2013 study of 2,000 criminal cases in Colorado found that defendants released on
