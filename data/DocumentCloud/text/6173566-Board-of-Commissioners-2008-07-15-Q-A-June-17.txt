Question/Comment
Acknowledged Linda Kaiser, Managing Director of
Resident Services, for support of ABLA community.
Why does it take 30-45 days to scheduling an inspection
for Section 8 units?

Does not agree with new process for Summer Jobs for
Youths Program. At some time in the future, will
program be reinstated and the LAC’s be able to select
their own candidates?

Status
Comments Noted.
Customarily,
initial
scheduling
for
inspection of Section 8 units should be 72
hours after contact with the landlord.
Unexpected delays may have arisen due to
internal
matters.
The
CHA/CHAC
apologizes for any inconvenience.
The CHA has partnered once again with After
School Matters to provide summer preapprentice and internship slots for CHA teens.
An additional 150 slots have been secured
bringing this year’s total to 370. The LAC’s
were able to provide names from the 2008
KidStart list to the CHA who could then have
the choice to participate in any After School
Matters program, either on or near a CHA
development, or located anywhere throughout
the city, with transportation vouchers provided.
