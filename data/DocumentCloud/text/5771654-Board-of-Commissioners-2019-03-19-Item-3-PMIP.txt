BACKGROUND
The Property Managers Insurance Program (PMIP) was created in 1999 to provide liability protection for
the Authority and its property management firms. The PMIP is defined as an ‘Owner Controlled
Insurance Program’ (OCIP). By purchasing insurance to cover certain liabilities associated with the
management of the portfolio, which exceed $250,000.00 per claim, the owner/Authority can manage
claims and expenses within the self-insured layer (SIR) while maintaining consistent coverage for itself
and each Property Manager, even when management firms or insurers transition.
PROCUREMENT PROCESS
The Authority utilizes a commercial insurance brokerage firm to place all Property & Casualty insurance
coverages, because insurance products can only be procured or purchased through a licensed insurance
broker. In 2001 the CHA received an exemption from HUD allowing it to purchase insurance through a
licensed insurance broker.
This is the fourth PMIP insurance placement conducted by Arthur J Gallagher, the CHA’s current broker
of record. The process included submitting insurance specifications, claims data, and resident

 demographics to underwriters to formulate pricing for insurance coverage. The specifications were
submitted to 44 insurers, some of which quoted multiple lines of coverage. The results are as follows:

COVERAGE STRUCTURE
The aggregate limit of coverage in place at the CHA, $22 million, is constructed using three different
layers of coverage: (1) primary General Liability up to $2 million; (2) Lead Excess Liability, which provides
coverage in the $2 million – $12 million layer; and (3) Excess Liability, which provides coverage for the
$12 million - $22 million layer.
By purchasing insurance, the Authority and its Property Managers are granted coverage for certain
liabilities associated with the operation of the portfolio that exceed $250,000.00.
Life-safety improvements in senior hi-rises have made underwriters feel more comfortable with CHA’s
risk, and in 2010 lowered its SIR from $750,000 to $250,000. The Authority faces a $250,000 self-insured
retention (SIR), or ‘deductible’, for each and every occurrence, claim or lawsuit filed against the CHA
and/or its Property Manager(s). The SIR is commonly referred to as the “operating layer” within which
most incurred losses are placed. Insurers will not entertain coverage at a lower deductible, due to
adverse underwriting characteristics, including: habitational, public housing, Cook County / Chicago legal
venues. PMIP coverage provides protection for large claims above the SIR; claims below the SIR of
$250,000.00 per claim will not be paid by the proposed insurer.
