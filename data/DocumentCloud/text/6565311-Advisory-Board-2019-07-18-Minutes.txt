West Side Catholic, Stella Maris, LMM, Joseph ?5 Home, City Mission, Veterans Service
Commission and others to achieve the goal of ending Veteran homelessness.

Rapid Re-Housing Utilization Subsidy Changes:

Please see ATTACHMENTS that provide RRH utilization data for January June 2019, and the
new Subsidy structure for all participants. Experience over the past 18 months suggests that
in order to be successful, most households would benefit from an extension of subsidy from 4
months to 6 months. Based on Case manager recommendations, Families and Youth may be
extended up to 6 more months with a declining subsidy. Single Adult HH will continue with 2
months of a full subsidy, but have the option to receive up to 2 additional months subsidy at
a declining percentage. The objective is to reduce returns to homelessness while working to

support stability.

Hepatitis Outbreak Vaccinations: Contact Jeannie Brooks, City of Cleveland Department of
Public Health: ibrooks@citv.cleveland.oh.us:
Jeannie Citerman Kraeger, who is with the Cleveland Dept. of Public Health, encouraged
providers to contact the Health Department to find out how they can access prevention and

vaccination information.

NOFA STRATEGY DISCUSSION - SUMMARY

Tentative Recommendations [Funding approaches

has over $3.2 from various sources dedicated to RRH. It is conceivable that if the is successful in receiving DV Bonus funds and the YHDP

Grant, additional RRH SS will be available. Would it make sense to REALLOCATE some of the RRH dollars that are coming through the to meet
identified GAPS The benefit to REALLOCATION is that we can be fairly certain the project will be funded.

If we reallocate what are the top priorities for reallocated dollars? How do we decide?

Per HUD guidelines, if an Applicant chooses to REALLOCATE project funds, that Applicant would be in a position to influence the use of the funds in the
reallocation activity.

GAPS:
- Front Steps 8 units

- PSH for non-chronic, disabled populations (families, single adults)
- HMIS

Idea: Reallocate County RRH award of $722,000

HMIS - 150,000
572,000
Front Steps 8 Units - 84,000
