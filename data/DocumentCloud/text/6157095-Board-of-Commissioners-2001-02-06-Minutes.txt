Submitting a Proposed Ordinance sponsored by
MIKE QUIGLEY, County Commissioner
Co-Sponsored by
HERBERT T. SCHUMANN, JR. and WILLIAM R. MORAN, County Commissioners
PROPOSED ORDINANCE
AN ORDINANCE DIRECTING COOK COUNTY TO ADOPT LEADERSHIP IN
ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT AL DESIGN (LEED) GREEN BUILDING
RATING SYSTEM FOR ALL NEWLY CONSTRUCTED COUNTY FACILITIES
WHEREAS, buildings consume 30% of the total energy and 60% of electricity generated in the United
States; and
WHEREAS, the planning, design, construction, and operation of Cook County's buildings, facilities and
leaseholds should have a significant positive effect on the County's sustainability. Cook County shall
promote resource-efficient design of new County facilities in order to increase their efficiency, save
financial resources, and reduce the negative environmental impact of demolition, construction, and
operation of buildings; and
WHEREAS, Cook County's design and building decisions impact the prudent use of the County's energy
and water supplies, the cost of remediating hazardous materials conditions, the health and productivity of
its employees, transportation choices of County employees and visitors of County facilities, as well as the
rate at which the County's landfill capacity is depleted; and
WHEREAS, the lack of adequate areas for collecting and loading recyclable materials is a significant
impediment to diverting solid waste and creates an urgent need for governmental bodies to address space
allocation for solid waste source reduction, recycling, and composting activities; and
WHEREAS, many federal, state, and municipal governmental bodies have recognized the positive role
they can play in helping to establish a market for environmentally-preferable design and construction
materials by promulgating green building ordinances and guidelines; and
WHEREAS, thoughtful planning and design decisions made by the County in the construction and
remodeling of its facilities and leaseholds can result in significant cost savings to the County over the life
of such facilities and leaseholds; and
WHEREAS, buildings with good overall environmental quality, including effective ventilation, good
indoor air quality, proper lighting, and appropriate acoustics, can increase worker productivity by six to
16 percent; and

622

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 6, 2001
WHEREAS, the United States Green Building Council (USGBC), a non-profit, nationally recognized
association with membership representing all segments of the building industry, including architects,
manufacturers, government agencies, and environmentalists, has created LEED, a green building rating
system that provides specific principles and practices, some mandatory but the majority discretionary, that
may be applied during the design, construction, and operation phases, which enable the building to be
awarded points from reaching preset standards of environmental efficiency so that it may achieve LEED
certification from the USGBC as a "green" building; and
WHEREAS, LEED is recognized nation-wide by public and private sectors alike as a credible and viable
guide for realizing the goal of a sustainable, energy efficient building that achieves significant cost
savings over its lifespan; and
WHEREAS, the cities of Seattle and Austin have adopted ordinances that require their government
buildings to meet LEED standards for certification; and
WHEREAS, our Anned Forces recognize the need for sustainable building design, as evidenced in the
recent construction of the Bachelor Enlisted Quarters at the Great Lakes Naval Training Center in
Waukegan, Illinois, the first building in the area designated a LEED building by the USGBC; and
WHEREAS, in adopting the requirements set forth in this legislation, the Board of Commissioners
recognizes that the substantial long-term economic, health and environmental benefits to the citizens of
Cook County realized through the use of green design strategies justifies the possibility of initial
increased capital expenditures; and
WHEREAS, LEED is based on accepted environmental and energy principles, is divided into five key
categories, is comprehensive in scope, supported with well-coordinated resources, and clearly describes
the intent, requirements, and suggested technologies and strategies to apply for each credit available; and
WHEREAS, LEED ensures that through all stages of a new Cook County building's lifecycle: design,
construction, and operation, the building will have a less negative impact on the environment and a more
positive impact on the health and productivity of its workers as well as the financial strength of this
County.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED,

I.

That Cook County does hereby order all of its newly constructed buildings to employ the
LEED Green Building Rating System, Version 2.0, throughout their design, construction,
and operation and does further order that each new building must achieve the LEED
silver level of certification.

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED,

II.

That the USGBC intends to release a revised version of the LEED Green Building Rating
System every three years; and with this in consideration when beginning a new building
project, Cook County shall refer to the most current version of the LEED in existence;
and after registering with the USG BC at the design stage of the project as is required, the
County may adhere to that existing version until completion of the project, regardless of
any new LEED version that may be released at a later time.

623

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 6, 2001

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED,
III.

That with specific regard to the LEED Energy and Atmosphere category, because
achieving increasing levels of energy performance above the set energy code standards is
the surest way of realizing significant operational cost savings, all buildings must obtain a
total of at least eight points.

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED,
IV.

That Cook County also encourages the application of LEED principles during retrofit and
renovation projects of its current standing structures whenever it is practicable.

Commissioner Quigley, seconded by Commissioner Carr, moved that the communication be referred to
the Committee on Construction (Comm. No. 241445) and the Committee on Environmental Control.
(Comm. No. 241446). The motion carried unanimously.

noted that this is the first of two bond issues to be proposed this year to help finance the capital program.
Commissioner Lechowicz introduced into the record questions from Chairman Daley and the responses
from Mr. Glaser.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question regarding the expenditures for the courtrooms, Michael
LaMont, Director of the Office of Capital Planning and Policy, responded that $57 million of the amount
is allocated over the next two years for the New Traffic and Domestic Violence Court. He further stated
$2.5 million is associated with the final billing of the recently opened temporary traffic court in the Daley
Center.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question regarding bonding for capital equipment, Mr. Glaser
responded that as part of the annual budget process, the Capital Review Committee reviews the various
capital requests from individual departments and makes recommendations on what will be approved as
part of the budget. Mr. Glaser stated the County is borrowing prospectively for years 2001 and 2002.
That is approximately $25 million per year. Then the County will be reimbursed for prior capital
expenditures from years 2000 and 1999.
Commissioner Hansen inquired if the earlier purchases were financed directly or self-financed.
Mr. Glaser replied that the purchases were self-financed.
Commissioner Hansen asked about the time frame for spending $100 million in bond proceeds for capital
purposes.
Mr. Glaser responded that the County's capital expenditures are roughly $25 million annually, so the
$100 million in bond proceeds would be expected to cover a four year period, beginning retroactively two
years prior, and looking forward two years.
Commissioner Hansen inquired about the propriety of using current bond proceeds to cover capital
spending in previous fiscal years. He asked if bond counsel had approved this plan.
Mr. Glaser responded that he is confident this multi-year capital spending plan is an appropriate use of
bond proceeds. He anticipates that the final written opinion submitted by bond counsel, Chapman &
Cutler, will be favorable.
Chairman Daley asked Tom Glaser to introduce the members of the financing team.
Mr. Glaser stated the transaction participants are: Senior Underwriters: Lehman Brothers and Banc One
Capital Markets; Co-Managing Underwriters: Jackson Securities, LaSalle Capital Markets, Loop Capital
Markets; LLC, Mischler Financial Group and Siebert Branford Shank & Co; Financial Advisors: A.C.
Advisory, Inc. and Davis Financial, Inc.; Legal Team-Issuer Counsel: State's Attorney; Underwriters'
Counsel: Katten Muchin & Zavis and Pugh, Jones & Johnson; Bond Counsel: Chapman & Cutler and
William P. Tuggle & Assoc.; and Trustee: Amalgamated Bank of Chicago.
Commissioner Lechowicz asked Mr. Glaser to provide a list of the financing team and their level of
participation to the committee.
Commissioner Lechowicz expressed concern about an adequate lunchroom facility for the

671

5th

floor staff.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 6, 2001
President Stroger stated that renovating the lunchroom could be handled without making it a part of the
bond issue. He asked Mike LaMont and Bill Huffman, Director of the Department of Facilities
Management, to alleviate this concern.

Vice Chairman Carr, seconded by Commissioner Butler, moved that the Ordinance (Item 241085)
be approved and adopted. Vice Chairman Carr called for a Roll Call, the vote of yeas and nays
being as follows:
ROLL CALL ON MOTION TO APPROVE ITEM 241085

There shall be borrowed on the credit of and for and on behalf of the County the sum of not to

aggregate amount, or such lesser amount, in one or more series, all as may be determined by the Chief
Financial Officer, and shall be designated "General Obligation Bonds, Series 2001_," with such
additions or modifications as shall be determined to be necessary by the Chief Financial Officer at the
time of the sale of the Bonds to reflect the purpose of the issue, the order of sale of the Bonds, whether the
Bonds are Current Interest Bonds or Capital Appreciation Bonds, and any other authorized features of the
Bonds determined by the Chief Financial Officer as desirable to be reflected in the title of the Bonds
being issued and sold. The Bonds shall be dated February 1, 2001, or such other date as may be provided

such Capital Appreciation Bond (the "Yield to Maturity"). Any Capital Appreciation Bonds shall mature
on May 15 or November 15 of each of the years as provided in the relevant Bond Order, within the
limitations set forth below.
All or any po1tion of the Bonds may be issued as Current Interest Bonds. Current Interest Bonds

than one date), shall mature on November 15 of each of the years as provided in the relevant Bond Order,
within the limitations set forth below, and, within each series, shall be numbered 1 and upward.
All or any portion of the Bonds may be initially issued as Capital Appreciation Bonds containing
provisions for the conversion of the Compound Accreted Value of such Bonds into Current Interest
Bonds (the "Convertible CABs ") at such time following the initial issuance thereof as shall be approved
by the Chief Financial Officer. While in the form of Capital Appreciation Bonds, such Bonds shall be
subject to all of the provisions and limitations of this Ordinance relating to Capital Appreciation Bonds,

678

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 6, 2001
and while in the fonn of Current Interest Bonds, such Bonds shall be subject to all of the provisions and
limitations of this Ordinance relating to Current Interest Bonds. The terms and provisions relating to the
transfer and exchange of Convertible CABs for Current Interest Bonds shall be as approved by the Chief
Financial Officer at the time of sale of the Convertible CABs.
All Bonds shall become due and payable as provided in the relevant Bond Order, provided,
however, that no Bond shall have a Stated Maturity which is later than November 15, 2031, and further
provided that the aggregate amount of principal of, interest on and Maturity Amount of the Bonds payable
on each November 15 and succeeding May 15 shall not exceed the aggregate amount of Pledged Taxes
levied therefor in Section 9 of this Ordinance and capitalized interest, if any. The Current Interest Bonds
shall bear interest at the rate or rates percent per annum and the Capital Appreciation Bonds shall have
Yields to Maturity as provided in the relevant Bond Order, provided, however, that no Current Interest
Bond shall bear interest at a rate in excess of nine percent (9 .0%) per annum and no Capital Appreciation
Bond shall have a Yield to Maturity in excess of nine percent (9.0%) per annum.
Each Current Interest Bond shall bear interest from the later of its dated date or the most recent
interest payment date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, until the principal amount of
such Bond is paid, such interest (computed upon the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months)
being payable on May 15 and November 15 of each year, commencing on such May 15 or November 15
as determined by the Chief Financial Officer at the time of the sale of any Current Interest Bonds.
Interest on each Current Interest Bond shall be paid to the person in whose name such Bond is registered
at the close of business on the Regular Record Date, by check or draft of the Bond Registrar, or, at the
option of any registered owner of $1,000,000 or more in aggregate principal amount of Current Interest
Bonds, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such bank in the continental United States as
the registered owner of such Bonds shall request in writing to the Trustee.
Each Capital Appreciation Bond shall bear interest from its dated date at the rate percent per
annum compounded semiannually on each May 15 and November 15, commencing on such May 15 or
November 15 as determined by the Chief Financial Officer at the time of sale of such Capital
Appreciation Bonds, which will produce the Yield to Maturity until the Stated Maturity thereof. Interest
on the Capital Appreciation Bonds shall be payable only at Stated Maturity.
So long as the Bonds are held in book-entry form as hereinafter more specifically set forth,
interest on each Bond shall be paid to the Depository by check or draft or electronic funds transfer as may
be agreed to by the County and the Depository; in the event the Bonds should ever become available in
physical form to registered owners other than the Depository, interest on each Bond shall be paid by
check or draft of the Trustee to the person in whose name such Bond is registered at the close of business
on the Regular Record Date. Principal of and premium (if any) on each Current Interest Bond and the
Compound Accreted Value of each Capital Appreciation Bond shall be paid upon surrender in lawful
money of the United States of America, at the principal corporate trust office of the Trustee.
The Bonds shall have impressed or imprinted thereon the corporate seal or facsimile thereof of the
County and shall be signed by the manual or duly authorized facsimile signatures of the President and
County Clerk, as they shall determine, and in case any officer whose signature shall appear on any Bond
shall cease to be such officer before the delivery of such Bond, such signature shall nevertheless be valid
and sufficient for all purposes, the same as if such officer had remained in office until delivery.
All Bonds shall have thereon a certificate of authentication substantially in the form hereinafter
set forth duly executed by the Trustee as authenticating agent of the County and showing the date of
authentication. No Bond shall be valid or obligatory for any purpose or be entitled to any security or
benefit under this Ordinance unless and until such certificate of authentication shall have been duly

679

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 6, 2001
executed by the Trustee by manual signature, and such certificate of authentication upon any such Bond
shall be conclusive evidence that such Bond has been authenticated and delivered under this Ordinance.
The certificate of authentication on any Bond shall be deemed to have been executed by the Trustee if
signed by an authorized officer of the Trustee, but it shall not be necessary that the same officer sign the
certificate of authentication on all of the Bonds issued hereunder.
SECTION 4.

BOOK-ENTRY PROVISIONS.

The Bonds shall be initially issued in the form of a separate single fully registered Bond for each
maturity. Upon initial issuance, the ownership of each such Bond shall be registered in the Bond Register
therefor in the name of CEDE & Co., or any successor thereto, as nominee of the Depository. All of the
outstanding Bonds from time to time shall be registered in the Bond Register in the name of CEDE &
Co., as nominee of the Depository. The Chief Financial Officer is hereby authorized to execute and
deliver on behalf of the County a Representation Letter. Without limiting the generality of the authority
given to the Chief Financial Officer with respect to entering into such Representation Letter, it may
contain provisions relating to (a) payment procedures, (b) transfers of the Bonds or of beneficial interest
therein, (c) redemption notices or procedures unique to the Depository, (d) additional notices or
communications, and (e) amendment from time to time to conform with changing customs and practices
with respect to securities industry transfer and payment practices.
With respect to Bonds registered in the Bond Register in the name of CEDE & Co., as nominee of
the Depository and except as otherwise herein provided, the County and the Trustee shall have no
responsibility or obligation to any broker-dealer, bank or other financial institutions for which the
Depository holds Bonds from time to time as securities depository (each such broker-dealer, bank or other
financial institution being referred to herein as a "Depository Participant") or to any person on behalf of
whom such a Depository Participant holds an interest in the Bonds. Without limiting the meaning of the
immediately preceding sentence, the County and the Trustee shall have no responsibility or obligation
with respect to (a) the accuracy of the records of the Depository, CEDE & Co., or any Depository
Participant with respect to any ownership interest in the Bonds, (b) the delivery to any Depository
Participant or any other person, other than a registered owner of a Bond as shown in the Bond Register, of
any notice with respect to the Bonds, including any notice of redemption, or (c) the payment to any
Depository Participant or any other person, other than a registered owner of a Bond as shown in the Bond
Register, of any amount with respect to principal of, interest on or Maturity Amount of the Bonds.
No person other than a registered owner of a Bond as shown in the Bond Register shall receive a
Bond certificate with respect to any Bond. Upon delivery by the Depository to the Trustee of written
notice to the effect that the Depository has determined to substitute a new nominee in place of CEDE &
Co., and subject to the provisions hereof with respect to the payment of interest to the registered owners
of Bonds at the close of business on the 15th day of the month next preceding the applicable interest
payment date, the name "CEDE & Co." in this Ordinance shall refer to such new nominee of the
Depository.
In the event that (a) the County determines that the Depository is incapable of discharging its
responsibilities described herein and in the Representation Letter, (b) the agreement between the County
and the Depository evidenced by the Representation Letter shall be terminated for any reason, or (c) the
County determines that it is in the best interests of the beneficial owners of the Bonds that they be able to
obtain certificated Bonds, the County shall notify the Depository and the Depository Participants of the
availability of Bond certificates, and the Bonds shall no longer be restricted to being registered in the
Bond Register in the name of CEDE & Co., as nominee of the Depository. The County may determine
that the Bonds shall be registered in the name of and deposited with a successor depository operating a
book-entry system, as may be acceptable to the County, or such depository's agent or designee, and ifthe

680

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 6, 2001
County does not select such alternate book-entry system, then the Bonds may be registered in whatever
name or names registered owners of Bonds transferring or exchanging Bonds shall designate, in
accordance with the provisions hereof. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Ordinance to the
contrary, so long as any Bond is registered in the name of CEDE & Co., as nominee of the Depository, all
payments with respect to principal of and interest on or Maturity Amount, as applicable, of such Bond
and all notices with respect to such Bond shall be made and given, respectively, in the manner provided in
the Representation Letter.
In the event that the Bonds ever become generally registrable, as aforesaid, the Chief Financial
Officer may, in his or her discretion at such time, designate a bank with trust powers or trust company,
duly authorized to do business as a bond registrar, paying agent, or both, to act in one or both such
capacities hereunder, in the event that the Chief Financial Officer shall determine it to be advisable.
Notice shall be given to the registered owners of any such designation in the same manner, as near as may
be practicable, as for a notice of redemption of Bonds, and as if the date of such successor taking up its
duties were the redemption date.
SECTION 5.

REDEMPTION.

If so provided in the relevant Bond Order, any Bonds may be redeemable prior to maturity at the
option of the County, in whole or in part on any date, at such times and at such redemption prices (to be
expressed as a percentage of the principal amount of Current Interest Bonds being redeemed and as a
percentage of the Compound Accreted Value of Capital Appreciation Bonds to be redeemed) not to
exceed one hundred three percent (103.00%), plus, in the case of Current Interest Bonds, accrued interest
to the date of redemption, as determined by the Chief Financial Officer at the time of the sale thereof. If
less than all of the outstanding Bonds of a series are to be optionally redeemed, the Bonds to be called
shall be called from such series, in such principal amounts and from such maturities as may be determined
by the County and within any maturity by lot within a maturity in the manner hereinafter provided. Any
Current Interest Bonds may be made subject to mandatory redemption, at par and accrued interest to the
date fixed for redemption, as determined by the Chief Financial Officer at the time of the sale thereof and
as set forth in the relevant Bond Order.
In connection with any mandatory redemption of Bonds as authorized above, the principal
amounts of such Bonds to be mandatorily redeemed in each year may be reduced through the earlier
optional redemption thereof, with any partial optional redemptions of such Bonds credited against future
mandatory redemption requirements in such order of the mandatory redemption dates as the Chief
Financial Officer may determine in the notice of optional redemption described in this Section. In the
absence of such determination, partial optional redemptions of such Bonds shall be credited against future
mandatory redemption requirements in inverse chronological order of such payments beginning with the
amount scheduled to become due at Stated Maturity, then the amount subject to mandatory redemption in
the year preceding Stated Maturity, and so on. In addition, on or prior to the 60th day preceding any
mandatory redemption date, the Trustee may, and if directed by the Chief Financial Officer shall,
purchase Bonds of such maturities in an amount not exceeding the amount of such Bonds required to be
retired on such mandatory redemption date and at a price not exceeding par plus accrued interest. Any
such Bonds so purchased shall be cancelled and the principal amount thereof shall be credited against the
payment required on such next mandatory redemption date.
The County shall, at least 45 days prior to the redemption date (unless a shorter time shall be
satisfactory to the Trustee), notify the Trustee of such redemption date, the years of maturity and principal
amounts of Bonds to be redeemed and, if applicable, the mandatory redemption payment so affected.
Current Interest Bonds shall be redeemed only in the principal amount of $5,000 each and integral
multiples thereof, and Capital Appreciation Bonds shall be redeemed only in amounts representing $5,000

681

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 6, 2001
Maturity Amount and integral multiples thereof. In the event of the redemption of less than all the Bonds
of a series of like maturity, the aggregate principal amount or Maturity Amount (as appropriate) thereof to
be redeemed shall be $5,000 or an integral multiple thereof, and the Trustee shall assign to each such
Bond of such maturity a distinctive number for each $5,000 principal amount or Maturity Amount (as
appropriate) of such Bond and shall select by lot from the numbers so assigned as many numbers as, at
$5,000 for each number, shall equal the principal amount or Maturity Amount (as appropriate) of such
Bonds to be redeemed. Current Interest Bonds or Capital Appreciation Bonds to be redeemed shall be
those to which were assigned numbers so selected; provided that only so much of the principal amount or
Maturity Amount (as appropriate) of each Bond shall be redeemed as shall equal $5,000 for each number
assigned to it and so selected.
The Trustee shall promptly notify the County in writing of the Bonds or portions of Bonds
selected for redemption and, in the case of any Bond selected for partial redemption, the principal amount
thereof to be redeemed.
Unless waived by the owner of Bonds to be redeemed, notice of any such redemption shall be
given by the Trustee on behalf of the County by mailing the redemption notice by first class mail not less
than 30 days and not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption to each registered owner of
the Bond or Bonds to be redeemed at the address shown on the Bond Register or at such other address as
is furnished in writing by such registered owners to the Trustee.
All notices of redemption shall include at least the information as follows:
(1)

the redemption date;

(2)

the redemption price;

(3)
if less than all of the Bonds of a particular series are to be redeemed, the
identification (and, in the case of partial redemption, the respective principal amounts) of the
Bonds to be redeemed;
(4)
a statement that on the redemption date the redemption price will become due
and payable upon each such Bond or portion thereof called for redemption and that interest
thereon shall cease to accrue from and after said date; and
(5)
the place where such Bonds are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption
price, which place of payment shall be the principal corporate trust office of the Trustee.
Such additional notice as may be agreed upon with the Depository shall also be given so long as
the Bonds are held by the Depository.
Prior to any redemption date, the County shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money
sufficient to pay the redemption price of all the Bonds or portions of Bonds which are to be redeemed on
that date.
Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid, the Bonds or portions of Bonds so to be
redeemed shall, on the redemption date, become due and payable at the redemption price therein
specified, and from and after such date (unless the County shall default in the payment of the redemption
price) such Bonds or portions of Bonds shall cease to bear interest. Neither the failure to mail such
redemption notice nor any defect in any notice so mailed to any particular registered owner of a Bond
shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other registered owners. Notice having been

682

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 6, 2001
properly given, failure of a registered owner of a Bond to receive such notice shall not be deemed to
invalidate, limit or delay the effect of the notice or the redemption action described in the notice. Such
notice may be waived in writing by a registered owner of a Bond, either before or after the event, and
such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice shall be filed with the Trustee, but
such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such
waiver. Upon surrender of such Bonds for redemption in accordance with said notice, such Bonds shall
be paid by the Trustee at the redemption price. Interest due on or prior to the redemption date shall be
payable as herein provided for payment of interest. Upon surrender for any partial redemption of any
Bond, there shall be prepared for the registered owner a new Bond or Bonds of the same Stated Maturity
in the amount of the unpaid principal or Maturity Amount.
With respect to any redemption of Bonds, unless moneys sufficient to pay the redemption price of
the Bonds to be redeemed shall have been received by the Trustee prior to the giving of the notice of
redemption, such notice may, at the option of the County, state that such redemption shall be conditional
upon the receipt of such moneys by the Trustee on or prior to the date fixed for redemption. If such
moneys are not received, such notice shall be of no force and effect, the Trustee shall not redeem such
Bonds, and the Trustee shall give notice, in the same manner in which the notice of redemption shall have
been given, that such moneys were not so received and that such Bonds will not be redeemed.
If any Bond or portion of Bond called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof
for redemption, in the case of Current Interest Bonds, the principal shall, until paid, bear interest from the
redemption date at the rate borne by the Bond or portion of Bond so called for redemption, and, in the
case of Capital Appreciation Bonds, the Compound Accreted Value at such redemption date shall
continue to accrue interest from such redemption date at the Yield to Maturity borne by such Capital
Appreciation Bond, or portion thereof, so called for redemption. All Bonds which have been redeemed
shall be cancelled and destroyed by the Trustee and shall not be reissued.
Upon the payment of the redemption price of Bonds being redeemed, each check or other transfer
of funds issued for such purpose shall bear the CUSIP number identifying, by issue and maturity, the
Bonds being redeemed with the proceeds of such check or other transfer.
SECTION 6.

REGISTRATION OF BONDS; PERSONS TREATED AS OWNERS.

The County shall cause the Bond Register to be kept at the principal corporate trust office of the
Trustee, which is hereby constituted and appointed the Registrar of the County. The County is authorized
to prepare, and the Trustee shall keep custody of, multiple Bond blanks executed by the County for use in
the transfer and exchange of Bonds.
Upon surrender for transfer of any Bond at the principal corporate trust office of the Trustee, duly
endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to the
Trustee and duly executed by, the registered owner or his or her attorney duly authorized in writing, the
County shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate, date and deliver in the name of the transferee or
transferees a new fully registered Bond or Bonds of the same series and of the same Stated Maturity of
Authorized Denominations, for, in the case of Current Interest Bonds, a like aggregate principal amount
and, in the case of Capital Appreciation Bonds, of the same Yield to Maturity and Stated Maturity in the
amount of the unpaid Maturity Amount. Subject to the provisions of this Ordinance relating to the Bonds
as book-entry obligations only, should the Bonds no longer be held in such book-entry form, any fully
registered Bond or Bonds may be exchanged at said principal corporate trust office of the Trustee for a
like aggregate principal amount of Bond or Bonds of the same Stated Maturity of other Authorized.
Denominations.

683

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 6, 2001
The execution by the County of any fully registered Bond shall constitute full and due
authorization of such Bond, and the Trustee shall thereby be authorized to authenticate, date and deliver
such Bond; provided, however, that the principal amount of outstanding Bonds authenticated by the
Trustee shall not exceed the authorized principal amount of Bonds less the amount of such Bonds which
have been paid.

Subject to the provisions of this Ordinance relating to the Bonds as book-entry obligations only,
should the Bonds no longer be held in such book-entry form, the Trustee shall not be required to transfer
or exchange any Bond during the period of fifteen (15) days next preceding any interest payment date on
such Bond, nor to transfer or exchange any Bond after notice calling such Bond for redemption has been
mailed, nor during a period of fifteen (15) days next preceding mailing of a notice of redemption of any
Bonds.

The person in whose name any Bond shall be registered shall be deemed and regarded as the
absolute owner thereof for all purposes, and payment of the principal of, premium (if any) or interest on
or any Maturity Amount of any Bond shall be made only to or upon the order of the registered owner
thereof or his or her legal representative. All such payments shall be valid and effectual to satisfy and
discharge the liability upon such Bond to the extent of the sum or sums so paid.

No service charge shall be made for any transfer or exchange of Bonds, but the County or the
Trustee may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may
be imposed in connection with any transfer or exchange of Bonds exchanged in the case of the issuance of
a Bond or Bonds for the outstanding portion of a Bond surrendered for redemption.

SECTION?.

obligations of the County and the County shall be obligated to levy ad valorem taxes upon all the taxable
property in the County for the payment of the Bonds and the interest thereon, without limitation as to rate
an amount. The County hereby pledges, as equal and ratable security for the Bonds, all present and future
proceeds of the Pledged Taxes on deposit in the Bond Fund for the sole benefit of the registered owners
of the Bonds, subject to the reserved right of the Corporate Authorities to transfer certain interest income
or investment profit earned in the Bond Fund to other funds of the County, as described in Section 12(A)
hereof.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 6, 2001
The County covenants and agrees with the purchasers and registered owners of the Bonds that so
long as any of the Bonds remain outstanding, the County will take no action or fail to take any action
which in any way would adversely affect the ability of the County to levy and collect the Pledged Taxes.
The County and its officers will comply with all present and future applicable laws in order to assure that
the Pledged Taxes may be levied, extended and collected as provided herein and deposited into the Bond
Fund.
A copy of this Ordinance, duly certified by the County Clerk, shall be filed in the office of the
County Clerk, and such filing shall constitute the authority for and it shall be the duty of said County
Clerk, in each year as aforesaid, to extend the taxes levied pursuant to this Section for collection, such
taxes to be in addition to and in excess of all other taxes heretofore or hereafter authorized to be levied by
the County on its behalf.
All receipts of the Pledged Taxes received by the County Collector shall be deposited daily, as far
as practicable, with the Trustee. All other moneys appropriated or used by the County for the payment of
the principal or redemption price of, and interest on, or Maturity Amount of, the Bonds shall be paid to
the Trustee. The Trustee shall be accountable only for moneys actually so deposited with the Trustee.
All Pledged Taxes, and all such moneys, shall be deposited by the Trustee into the Bond Fund.
The County Treasurer and the County Collector are hereby expressly authorized and directed to
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary to provide for the prompt deposit with the Trustee, in
accordance with this Ordinance, of all Pledged Taxes.
In the event that the amount necessary to pay principal of and interest on, or Maturity Amount of,
the Bonds in any year is such that there requires the levy of taxes in such year to be less than the amount
specified therefor in this Section, then the Chief Financial Officer shall, on or prior to June 1 of such year,
notify the Corporate Authorities of the amount of reduction in the amount levied in this Section for such
year resulting from such lesser requirements, and, in addition, the Chief Financial Officer shall file in the
office of the County Clerk a certificate of tax abatement for the year. In the event that upon the final sale
of the Bonds, such Bonds have been sold so as to require the levy of taxes in any year to be less than the
amount specified therefor in this Section, then the Chief Financial Officer shall include, in the final Bond
Order to be filed with the Corporate Authorities as described in Section 11 of this Ordinance, the amount
of reduction in the amount levied in this Section for that year and any succeeding year resulting from such
sale, and, in addition, the Chief Financial Officer shall file in the office of the County Clerk a certificate
of tax abatement for such year or years. In the event any of the Bonds are not to be sold and issued as
provided herein, the corresponding taxes herein levied to pay debt service thereon shall be abated in full.
Any certificate of abatement delivered pursuant to this paragraph shall refer to the amount of taxes levied
pursuant to this Section, shall indicate the amount of reduction in the amount of taxes levied by the
County resulting from the then-current sale of the Bonds or the non-issuance thereof, which reduced
amount is to be abated from such taxes, and shall further indicate the remainder of such taxes which is to
be extended for collection by said County Clerk.
SECTION 10.

POWERS AS TO BONDS AND PLEDGE.

The County is duly authorized to pledge the Pledged Taxes and other moneys, securities and
funds purported to be pledged by this Ordinance in the manner and to the extent provided in this
Ordinance. The Pledged Taxes and other moneys, securities and funds so pledged are and will be free
and clear of any pledge, lien, charge or encumbrance thereon or with respect thereto prior to, or of equal
rank with, the pledge created by this Ordinance. The County shall at all times, to the extent permitted by
law, defend, preserve and protect the pledge of the Pledged Taxes and other moneys, securities and funds
pledged under this Ordinance and all the rights thereto of the Bondholders under this Ordinance against
all claims and demands of all persons whomsoever.

such changes, additions, insertions, omissions or deletions as such officers may determine, with no further
official action of or direction by the Corporate Authorities.
The preparation, use and distribution of a preliminary official statement and an official statement
relating to each sale and issuance of the Bonds are hereby ratified and approved. The President and Chief
Financial Officer are each hereby authorized to execute and deliver an official statement relating to each
sale and issuance of the Bonds on behalf of the County. The preliminary official statement and official
statement herein authorized shall be in substantially the forms previously used for general obligation
financings of the County with appropriate revisions to reflect the terms and provisions of the Bonds and
to describe accurately the current condition of the County and the parties to the financing.
The President or the Chief Financial Officer is hereby authorized to execute and deliver from time
to time one or more agreements with counterparties selected by the Chief Financial Officer, the purpose
of which is to reduce the County's interest cost with respect to the Bonds (or any portion thereof), or to
reduce the County's exposure to fluctuations in the interest rate or rates payable on the Bonds or to insure,
protect or preserve its investments from any loss (including, without limitation, loss caused by
fluctuations in interest rates, markets or in securities). The stated aggregate notional amount under all
such agreements authorized hereunder shall not exceed the principal amount of the Bonds issued
hereunder (net of offsetting transactions entered into by the County). Any such agreement to the extent
practicable shall be in substantially the form of either the Local Currency - Single Jurisdiction version or
the Multicurrency-Cross Border version of the 1992 ISDA Master Agreement accompanied by the U.S.
Municipal Counterparty Schedule published by the International Swap Dealers Association (the "ISDA ")
or any successor form to be published by the ISDA, and in the appropriate confirmations of transactions
governed by that agreement, with such insertions, completions and modifications thereof as shall be
approved by the officer of the County executing the same, his or her execution to constitute conclusive
evidence of the Corporate Authorities' approval of such insertions, completions and modifications
thereof. Amounts payable by the County under any such agreement shall constitute operating expenses of
the County payable from any moneys, revenues, receipts, income, assets or funds of the County available
for such purpose. Such amounts shall not constitute an indebtedness of the County for which its full faith
and credit is pledged. Nothing contained in this Section shall limit or restrict the authority of the
President or the Chief Financial Officer to enter into similar agreements pursuant to prior or subsequent
authorization of the Corporate Authorities.
SECTION 12.

CREATION OF FUNDS AND APPROPRIATIONS.

A.
There is hereby created the "General Obligation Bonds, Series 2001, Bond Fund" (the
"Bond Fund"), which shall be the fund for the payment of principal of and interest on the Bonds. The
Bond Fund shall be held and maintained as a separate and segregated account by the Trustee. Accrued
interest, capitalized interest and premium, if any, received upon delivery of the Bonds shall be deposited
into the Bond Fund and be applied to pay first interest coming due on the Bonds.
The Pledged Taxes shall either be deposited into the Bond Fund and used solely and only for
paying the principal of and interest on, or Maturity Amount of, the Bonds or be used to reimburse a fund
or account from which advances to the Bond Fund may have been made to pay principal of or interest on,
or Maturity Amount of, the Bonds prior to receipt of Pledged Taxes. Interest income or investment profit
earned in the Bond Fund shall be retained in the Bond Fund for payment of the principal of and interest
on Current Interest Bonds on the interest payment date next after such interest or profit is received or, to
the extent lawful and as determined by the Corporate Authorities, transferred to such other funds as may
be determined.

695

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 6, 2001
B.
Proceeds of the Bonds in an amount necessary to provide for the refunding of the Series
1996 Bonds shall be irrevocably deposited with the Trustee for the payment of the Series 1996 Bonds.
C.
Proceeds of the Bonds in an amount necessary to advance refund the Prior Bonds, if any
of the Prior Bonds are advance refunded, shall be deposited in an irrevocable escrow account to be held
by the Trustee, as escrow agent, or such other escrowee as may be authorized in the Bond Order and so
identified, and administered pursuant to the refunding escrow agreement authorized herein.
D.
The remaining proceeds of the Bonds shall be set aside in one or more separate funds of
the County, hereby created, and designated as the "Public Safety Project Fund, " the "Health Fund
Project Fund," the "Corporate Project Fund," and the "Capital Equipment Project Fund" (collectively,
the "Project Funds"). Any Project Fund may further be divided into accounts and designated the "Series
___ Bonds Project Account"(an "Account"). The Project Funds shall be held and maintained as
separate and segregated accounts by the Trustee. Moneys in the Project Funds may be withdrawn by the
County to pay the costs of the Projects upon requisition by the Chief Financial Officer or any other
employee of the County designated by the Chief Financial Officer.
Alternatively, the Chief Financial Officer may allocate the proceeds of the Bonds to one or more
related project funds or accounts of the County already in existence; provided, however, that this shall not
relieve the County and such officer of the duty to account for the proceeds as if any Project Fund or
Account were created as herein provided. The County by its Corporate Authorities reserves the right, as it
becomes necessary from time to time, to change the purposes of expenditure of any Project Fund or its
accounts, to change priorities, to revise cost allocations between expenditures and to substitute projects, in
order to meet current needs of the County; subject, however, to the provisions of the Act and to the tax
covenants of the County relating to the Tax Exempt status of interest on the Bonds.
(E)
The sum necessary, as determined by the Chief Financial Officer, of the principal
proceeds of the Bonds shall be deposited into a separate and segregated fund, hereby created, to be known
as the "Expense Fund" (the "Expense Fund") and shall be used by the County to pay costs of issuance of
the Bonds in accordance with normal County disbursement procedures. Any funds remaining to the
credit of the Expense Fund on the date which is six months following the date of delivery of the Bonds
shall be transferred to the County Treasurer for deposit into such fund or account of the County as the
Chief Financial Officer may direct.
(F)
Investments. The moneys on deposit in the Bond Fund may be invested from time to
time in Qualified Investments. Any such investments may be sold from time to time by the Trustee
without further direction from the County as moneys may be needed for the purposes for which the Bond
Fund has been created. The moneys on deposit in each Project Fund shall be invested in any lawful
investment for County funds. In addition, the Chief Financial Officer shall direct the Trustee (which
direction may be by facsimile transmission by the County to the Trustee and confirmed by facsimile
transmission by the Trustee to the County) to sell such investments when necessary to remedy any
deficiency in the Bond Fund, any Project Fund or any accounts created therein. All other investment
earnings shall be attributed to the account for which the investment was made.
All moneys (not including securities) held by the Trustee subject to the provisions of this Section
may be deposited by it, on demand or time deposit, in its banking department or with such banks, national
banking associations, trust companies, savings banks or savings and loan associations, that are members
of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as may be designated by the President or the Chief
Financial Officer. No such moneys shall be deposited with any such financial institution in an amount
exceeding 50 percent of the amount that an officer of such financial institution shall certify to the Trustee
and the Chief Financial Officer as the combined capital and surplus of such financial institution. No such

696

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 6, 2001
moneys shall be deposited or remain on deposit with any such financial institution in excess of the
amount insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, unless (a) such financial
institution shall have lodged with the trust department of the Trustee or with a Federal Reserve Bank or
branch or, with the written approval of the Trustee and the Chief Financial Officer, pledged to some other
financial institution for the benefit of the County and the holders of Bonds, as collateral security for the
moneys deposited, Federal Obligations or Agency Obligations having a market value (exclusive of
accrued interest) at least equal to 100 percent of the amount of such moneys, and (b) the Trustee shall
have a perfected first lien in the Federal Obligations or Agency Obligations serving as collateral, and such
Federal Obligations or Agency Obligations shall be free from all third party liens. The Trustee shall
allow and credit interest on any such moneys held by it at such rate as it customarily allows upon similar
funds of similar size and under similar conditions or as required by law. Interest in respect of moneys or
on securities in any fund shall be credited in each case to the fund in which such moneys or securities are
held.
The County may invest any moneys in a repurchase agreement. Each repurchase agreement shall
meet the requirements of the Public Funds Investment Act of the State of Illinois, as amended, or be
secured by Federal Obligations or Agency Obligations or obligations described in clause (d) of the
definition of Qualified Investments having a market value, marked to market weekly, at least equal to 102
percent of the amount invested in the repurchase agreement plus accrued interest. The Trustee shall at all
times have a first lien in such Federal Obligations or Agency Obligations perfected (i) by possession of
certificated securities held by the Trustee or held by a third party acting on behalf of the Trustee if the
Trustee is providing the collateral securities, or (ii) under the book-entry procedures specified in 31 Code
of Federal Regulations 306. l et seq. or 31 Code of Federal Regulations 350.0 et seq. The President or the
Chief Financial Officer is hereby authorized to enter into, execute and deliver any investment or
repurchase agreement authorized by this Ordinance, and any additional documents as shall be necessary
to accomplish the purposes of any such agreement.
SECTION 13.
A.

GENERAL TAX COVENANTS.

thereon, will be used, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, in any activity carried on by any person
other than a state or local governmental unit.

of such property or (ii) on a present value basis, derived from payments in respect of property, or
borrowed money, used or to be used in any activity carried on by any person other than a state or local

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 6, 2001
4.
No user of any Project other than a state or local governmental unit will use more than
five percent of any Project, in the aggregate, on any basis other than the same basis as the general public;
and no person other than a state or local governmental unit will be a user of more than five percent of any
Project, in the aggregate, as a result of (i) ownership, (ii) actual or beneficial use pursuant to a lease or a
management, service, incentive payment, research or output contract, or (iii) any other similar
arrangement, agreement or understanding, whether written or oral.
5.
The County has not and will not enter into any arrangement that conveys to any person,

receiving or will receive any special economic benefit from use of any portion of the Project that is not
available for use by the general public.
6.
No more than the lesser of five percent of the proceeds of the Bonds or $5,000,000 have
been or will be used to provide professional sports facilities. For purposes of this paragraph, the term
"professional sports facilities" (i) means real property or related improvements used for professional
sports exhibitions, games or training, regardless of whether the admission of the public or press is allowed
or paid and (ii) includes any use of a facility that generates a direct or indirect monetary benefit (other
than reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses) for a person who uses such facilities for professional
sport exhibitions, games or training.
B.

PERTAINING TO REBATE.

The County further certifies and covenants as follows with respect to the requirements of Section
148(f) of the Code, relating to the rebate of "excess arbitrage profits" (the "Rebate Requirement") to the
United States:
1.
Unless an applicable exception to the Rebate Requirement is available to the County will
meet the Rebate Requirement.
2.
Relating to applicable exceptions, any Designated Officer is hereby authorized to make
such elections under the Code as either such officer shall deem reasonable and in the best interests of the
County. If such election may result in a "penalty in lieu of rebate" as provided in the Code, and such
penalty is incurred (the "Penalty"), then the County shall pay such Penalty.
3.
The Designated Officers may cause to be established, at such time and in such manner as
they may deem necessary or appropriate hereunder, a "2001 General Obligation Bonds Rebate [or
Penalty, if applicable] Fund" (the "148 Compliance Fund") for the Bonds, and such officers shall further,
not less frequently than annually, cause to be transferred to the 148 Compliance Fund the amount
determined to be the accrued liability under the Rebate Requirement or Penalty. Said Designated Officers
shall cause to be paid to the U.S., without further order or direction from the Corporate Authorities, from
time to time as required, amounts sufficient to meet the Rebate Requirement or to pay the Penalty.
4.
Interest earnings in the Bond Fund and any Project Fund are hereby authorized to be
transferred, without further order or direction from the Corporate Authorities, from time to time as
required, to the 148 Compliance Fund for the purposes herein provided; and proceeds of the Bonds and
other funds of the County are also hereby authorized to be used to meet the Rebate Requirement or to pay
the Penalty, but only if necessary after application of investment earnings as aforesaid and only as
appropriated by the Corporate Authorities.

698

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 6, 2001
SECTION 14.

REGISTERED FORM.

The County recognizes that Section 149 of the Code requires the Bonds to be issued and to
remain in fully registered form in order to be and remain Tax Exempt. In this connection, the County
agrees that it will not take any action to permit the Bonds to be issued in, or converted into, bearer or
coupon form.
SECTION 15.

FURTHER TAX-EXEMPTION COVENANTS.

The County agrees to comply with all provisions of the Code which, if not complied with by the
County, would cause the Bonds not to be Tax Exempt. In furtherance of the foregoing provisions, but
without limiting their generality, the County agrees: (a) through its officers, to make such further specific
covenants, representations as shall be truthful, and assurances as may be necessary or advisable; (b) to
comply with all representations, covenants and assurances contained in certificates or agreements as may
be prepared by counsel approving the Bonds; (c) to consult with such counsel and to comply with such
advice as may be given; (d) to file such forms, statements and supporting documents as may be required
and in a timely manner; and (e) if deemed necessary or advisable by its officers, to employ and pay fiscal
agents, financial advisors, attorneys and other persons to assist the County in such compliance.
The County also certifies and further covenants with the Underwriters and registered owners of
the Bonds from time to time outstanding that moneys on deposit in any fund or account in connection
with the Bonds, whether or not such moneys were derived from the proceeds of the sale of the Bonds or
from any other source, will not be used in a manner which will cause the Bonds to be "arbitrage bonds"
within the meaning of Code Section 148 and any lawful regulations promulgated thereunder, as the same
presently exist or may from time to time hereafter be amended, supplemented or revised.
The County further covenants that it will not take any action, or omit to take any action or permit
the taking or omission of any action within its control (including, without limitation, making or permitting
any use of the proceeds of the Bonds) if taking, permitting or omitting to take such action would cause
any of the Bonds to be a private activity bond within the meaning of the Code or would otherwise cause
interest on the Bonds to be included in the gross income of the recipients thereof for federal income tax
purposes.
SECTION 16.

REIMBURSEMENT.

None of the proceeds of the Bonds will be used to pay, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part,
for an expenditure that has been paid by the County prior to the date hereof except architectural,
engineering costs or construction costs incurred prior to commencement of any of the Projects or
expenditures for which an intent to reimburse it as properly declared under Treasury Regulations Section
1.150-2. This Ordinance is in itself a declaration of official intent under Treasury Regulations Section
1.150-2 as to all costs of the Projects paid after the date hereof and prior to issuance of the Bonds.
SECTION 17.

OPINION OF COUNSEL EXCEPTION.

The County reserves the right to use or invest moneys in connection with the Bonds in any
manner, notwithstanding the tax-related covenants set forth in Sections 13 through 16 herein, provided,
that it shall first have received an opinion from an attorney or a firm of attorneys of nationally recognized
standing as bond counsel to the effect that such use or investment as contemplated is valid and proper
under applicable law and this Ordinance and that such use or investment will not adversely affect either
the Tax Exempt or qualified tax-exempt obligation status of the Bonds.

(b)
Provision for Payment. Bonds for the payment or redemption or prepayment of
which sufficient monies or sufficient Defeasance Obligations shall have been deposited with the
Trustee or an escrow agent having fiduciary capacity (whether upon or prior to the maturity or the

redeemed prior to the maturity thereof, notice of such redemption shall have been duly given as
provided in this Ordinance or arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee shall have been made for
the giving thereof. Defeasance Obligations shall be considered sufficient only if said investments
mature and bear interest in such amounts and at such times as will assure sufficient cash to pay
currently maturing interest, principal or Maturity Amount, as applicable, and redemption
premiums if any when due on the Bonds without rendering the interest on any Bonds taxable
under the Code.
The County may at any time surrender to the Trustee for cancellation by it any Bonds previously
authenticated and delivered hereunder, which the County may have acquired in any manner whatsoever,

thereafter be entitled only to payment out of the money and the proceeds of the Defeasance
Obligations deposited with aforesaid for their payment.
SECTION 21.

DUTIES OF TRUSTEE.

(a)
The Trustee shall exercise its rights and powers and use the same degree of care
and skill in their exercise as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the
conduct of such person's own affairs.
(b)
The Trustee need perform only those duties that are specifically set forth in this
Ordinance and no others. In the absence of bad faith on its part, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to
the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed, upon certificates or opinions
furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Ordinance. However, the Trustee
shall examine the certificates and opinions to determine whether they conform to the requirements of this
Ordinance.
(c)
The Trustee may not be relieved from liability for its own gross negligent action,
its own gross negligent failure to act or its own willful misconduct, except that:
(1)

this paragraph does not limit the effect of paragraph (b) of this Section,

(2) the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith
by a responsible officer of the Trustee, unless it is proved that the Trustee was
negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts,
(3) no provision of this Ordinance shall require the Trustee to expend or risk
its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its
duties hereunder or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if it shall have
reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity
against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it.

701

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 6, 2001
(d)

make any payment on any Bond to any holder of such Bond, unless it receives indemnity satisfactory to it
against any loss, liability or expense.
(f)
The Trustee shall not be liable for interest on any cash held by it except as the
Trustee may agree with the County or as set forth herein.

SECTION 22. RIGHTS OF TRUSTEE.
Subject to the foregoing Section:

(I)
First, to the payment of all reasonable costs and expenses of collection, fees, and
other amounts due to the Trustee hereunder; and thereafter,
(2)

All such monies shall be applied as follows :

(A)
first, to the payment to the persons entitled thereto of all installments of
interest on Outstanding Bonds then due, in the order of the maturity of such installments,
and, if the amount available shall not be sufficient to pay in full any particular
installment, then to the payment ratably, according to the amounts due on such
installment, to the persons entitled thereto, without any discrimination or preference;
(B)
second, to the payment to the persons entitled thereto of the unpaid
principal, of any of the Outstanding Bonds which shall have become due (other than
Bonds called for redemption for the payment of which monies are held pursuant to the
provisions of this Ordinance), in the order of their due dates, with interest upon such
Outstanding Bonds from the respective dates upon which they became due, and, if the
amount available shall not be sufficient to pay in full Outstanding Bonds due on any
particular date, together with such interest, then to the payment first of such interest,
ratably according to the amount of such interest due on such date, and then to the
payment of such principal ratably according to the amount of such principal due on such

third, to the payment of the redemption premium, if any, on and the

Whenever monies are to be applied by the Trustee pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph, such
monies shall be applied by the Trustee at such times, and from time to time, as the Trustee in its sole
discretion shall determine, having due regard to the amount of such monies available for application and
the likelihood of additional monies becoming available for such application in the future. The deposit of
such monies with the paying agents, or otherwise setting aside such monies, in trust for the proper
purpose, shall constitute proper application by the Trustee; and the Trustee shall incur no liability
whatsoever to the County to any Bondholder or to any other person for any delay in applying any such
funds, so long as the Trustee acts with reasonable diligence, having due regard to the circumstances, and
ultimately applies the same in accordance with such provisions of this Ordinance as may be applicable at
the time of application by the Trustee. Whenever the Trustee shall exercise such discretion in applying
such funds, it shall fix the date (which shall be an interest payment date unless the Trustee shall deem
another date more suitable) upon which such application is to be made and upon such date interest on the
amounts of principal paid on such date shall cease to accrue. The Trustee shall give such notice as it may
deem appropriate of the fixing of any such date and of the endorsement to be entered on each Bond on
which payment shall be made, and shall not be required to make payment to the holder of any unpaid
Bond until such Bond shall be presented to the Trustee for appropriate endorsement, or some other
procedure deemed satisfactory by the Trustee.
