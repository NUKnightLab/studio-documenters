Submitting a Proposed Ordinance Amendment sponsored by
GREGG GOSLIN, JOHN P. DALEY, JOAN PATRICIA MURPHY, TIMOTHY O. SCHNEIDER and
PETER N. SILVESTRI, County Commissioners
PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT
AN ORDINANCE AMENDMENT CHANGING THE MID-YEAR BUDGET REVIEW
TO A QUARTERLY BUDGET REVIEW
WHEREAS, by changing the mid-year budget review to a quarterly budget review, prior to budget
transfers, the County Board will have more time to evaluate current and proposed programs; and
WHEREAS, as part of this early budget analysis County offices, departments and agencies will be
required to submit quarterly reports to the Board of Commissioners for review; and
WHEREAS, the concept of these quarterly reports is to detail each office or agency’s mandatory
obligations and the programs associated with their established obligations; and
WHEREAS, the quarterly reports should also detail each office or agency’s discretionary programs, what
they cost, where the money comes from, and who they serve; and
WHEREAS, recognizing that under the leadership of Finance Committee Chairman John P. Daley these
quarterly reports were a part of the fiscal year 2008 budget resolution, this ordinance is designed to
formalize and mandate these quarterly reviews so the Cook County Code of Ordinances does not conflict
with the fiscal year 2008 budget resolution; and
WHEREAS, to ensure that these quarterly reports are uniform and relevant the County Board will
establish specific criteria to which reports must, at a minimum contain all the information that was
required in the “Mid-year budget review” ordinance.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that, Chapter
34 Finance, Sec. 34-5 of the Cook County Code is hereby amended as follows:
Sec. 34-5. Mid-year Quarterly budget review.
(a) Prior to the transfer of any budget line item The head of each department and constitutional
office or other agency is required to submit, to the satisfaction of the budget department, the following
"Cook County Mid-Year Budget Review Questionnaire" a minimum of two weeks prior to the Finance
Committee's Transfer of Funds Meeting Cook County Board of Commissioners on or before February 28,
May 30, August 30 and November 30 of each year a detailed report, in a format prepared and
promulgated by the Director of Budget and Management Services, showing what steps have been taken to
improve or maintain performance in the department or agency since the beginning of the respective fiscal
year, and the results those steps have brought. At a minimum the quarterly reports shall contain all of the
information that was formerly included in the “Mid-year budget review” ordinance (04-O-20).

Submitting a Proposed Ordinance Amendment sponsored by
GREGG GOSLIN and PETER N. SILVESTRI, County Commissioners
PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT
AMENDMENT TO THE DEFINITION OF BUILDING HEIGHT
WHEREAS, the definition of building height in the Cook County Building Ordinance is ambiguous and
contradictory on the issue of measuring height in the absence of curbs; and
WHEREAS, due to this oversight significant grade changes have become an ongoing problem in
unincorporated Cook County going forth relatively unfettered by County Ordinance; and
WHEREAS, a small change in the definition of building height will address this contradictory language
by clarifying the manner in which building height is measured when there is no curb present.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that the
Cook County Building Code be amended as follows:

6208

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 3, 2008
BUILDING CODE
ARTICLE III RULES AND DEFINITIONS
Building Height: is the vertical distance measured from the curb level or its equivalent opposite the
center existing lot grade five feet in front of the center of the front of the building, to the highest point of
the under side of the ceiling beams in the case of a flat roof; to the deck line of a mansard roof; and the
mean level of the under side of the rafters between the highest eaves and the ridge of a gable, hip, shed,
gambrel, or any other pitched roof. Where no curb level has been established the height of a building shall
be measured from the mean elevation of the existing lot grade at the front of the building.
_________________________
In accordance with Cook County Code Section 2-108(z)(1) Amendment or suspension of rules,
Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Moreno, moved to suspend Section 2-108(h)(1) Prior
notice to public; agendas. The motion carried unanimously.
Commissioner Goslin, seconded by Commissioner Silvestri, moved that the Proposed Ordinance
Amendment be referred to the Committee on Zoning & Building. (Comm. No. 294365). The motion
carried unanimously.

Fees for other permits. The County Board hereby authorizes the Superintendent
to issue additional permits for vehicles which do not conform to the requirements
of Chapter 15 of the Illinois Vehicle Code not otherwise specified in this
Subsection (b), so long as such permits are authorized by Chapter 15 of the
Illinois Vehicle Code. The Superintendent is further authorized to establish
reasonable fees for such permits, which fees shall be made public by posting a
schedule of said fees at the Department offices. The Superintendent shall report
to the County Board the schedule of fees established under this Subsection (b)(4)
on a yearly basis.

(5)

Fees for special handling. The County Board hereby authorizes the
Superintendent to impose a service charge for special handling of a permit when

credit card payment of permit fees or special transmission of a permit. Such
charge shall be determined by the Superintendent and shall be not less than the
actual cost of such special handling, if any, and not less than $10.00 per permit
for same-day processing.

(c)
The Superintendent shall not issue a permit for any vehicle and/or load that is divisible
and that can be carried, when divided, within the existing weight and size maximums specified in Chapter

$40.00 per hour for each hour spent by Department personnel engaged in such engineering inspections or
field investigations.
(e)
When law enforcement escort vehicles are required by the Superintendent for the safety
of the motoring public, and if, at the County's option, such escort is provided by the County, the permit
applicant will be required to pay a fee of $40.00 per hour per vehicle based upon pre-estimated time of
movement to be agreed upon between the Superintendent and the applicant. The minimum fee paid under

moved, the particular County highways for which the permit is requested, and whether the permit is
requested for a single trip or for monthly use.
(h)
The Superintendent is authorized to grant requests for permits within his or her
discretion. He or she may deny any such permit request or, if such permit is issued, limit the number of
trips by establishing seasonal or other time limitations within which the vehicle may be operated on the
County highways indicated, or otherwise prescribe conditions of operation of such vehicle, why such
limitations, in the judgment of the Superintendent, are necessary to assure against undue wear and tear to
the road foundations, surfaces or structures of County highways.

opened and any sealed bid(s) shall be returned to the bidder(s) via certified mail unopened. The Clerk

(l) Purchases and Contracts of $100,000.00 or more or contracts for contractual services of

exception, clarification or information prior to bid opening but failed to do so shall not be entitled to
protest a bid on the basis of insufficient information or clarity after the bids have been opened.
(m) Purchases and Contracts of $100,000.00 or more or contracts for contractual services of

(2)

For the initial Directors, the County Board shall approve or reject each of the names
submitted by the President within fourteen (14) days from the date the President
submitted the names, or at the next regular meeting of the County Board held subsequent
to the fourteen (14) day period. Where the County Board rejects the President's selection
of any name for the office of Director, the President shall within seven (7) days select a
replacement name from the remaining names on the initial list of twenty (20) names.
There is no limit on the number of names the County Board may reject. The County
Board shall exercise good faith in approving the initial Directors as soon as reasonably
practicable. In the event, the twenty (20) names initially submitted to the President by
the Nominating Committee are exhausted before the County Board approves ten (10)
names, the President shall direct the Nominating Committee to reconvene and to select
and submit an additional three (3) names for each Director still to be appointed.
a.

Each appointed Director, whether initial or subsequent, shall hold office until a
successor is appointed. Any appointed Director shall be eligible for
reappointment, but no appointed Director shall be eligible to serve more than two
consecutive five-year terms.

b.

Upon the expiration of an appointed Director’s term, the successor Director shall
be appointed in the same manner as the process set forth above for the
nomination, selection and appointment of initial Directors; provided, however,
that the Nominating Committee shall recommend three (3) names for each
Director position to be filled at that time.

c.

Any appointed Director may be removed for incompetence, malfeasance, neglect
of duty, willful or negligent failure to perform assigned duties, culpable
inefficiency in performing assigned duties, or any cause which renders the
Director unfit for the position. The President or one-third (1/3) of the members of
the County Board shall provide written notice to that Director of the proposed
removal of that Director from office; which notice shall state the specific grounds
which constitute cause for removal. The Director in receipt of such notice may
request to appear before the County Board and present reasons in support of his
or her retention. Thereafter, the County Board shall vote upon whether there are
sufficient grounds to remove that Director from office. The President shall notify
the subject Director of the final action of the County Board.

In the event of a vacancy in an appointed Director position on the System Board, the
President may recommend a replacement name to the County Board for its approval from
the remaining names on the most recent list of names recommended by the Nominating
Committee. In the alternative, the President may direct that the Nominating Committee
reconvene to prepare a new list of three (3) names for the vacancy within thirty (30) days
of the President’s request. The successor Director shall then be appointed in the same
manner set forth above for the selection and appointment of initial Directors.
a.

A vacancy shall occur upon the:
1.

Resignation,

2.

Death,

the System Board incurred as a result of performance of their duties as set forth in Section 38-80 of this
Article.
(d)

Directors shall have a fiduciary duty to the CCHHS and the County.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
RESOLUTION CONDEMNING HUMAN TRAFFICKING
WHEREAS, HR 3887 as introduced and passed with only two dissents in the U.S. House of
Representatives, introduces a cohesive legal framework for fighting trafficking by combining and
streamlining efforts against the international and domestic sale of human beings; and

6225

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 3, 2008
WHEREAS, HR 3887 constitutionally targets the demand for international trafficking by directly
addressing the networks that buy and sell women and children for commercial sexual exploitation; and
WHEREAS, HR 3887 removes a barrier to effective prosecutions against traffickers by making “force,
fraud and coercion” part of aggravated trafficking rather than a requirement for all convictions; and
WHEREAS, HR 3887 makes exporting sexual exploiters to other countries (“sex-tourism”) as significant
a crime as importing victims for sexual exploitation; and
WHEREAS, HR 3887 as drafted and passed by the U.S. House of Representatives, will assist many
victims of trafficking and the sex trade in Cook County; in Chicago alone, 16,000 – 25,000 women and
girls are involved in prostitution every year; this bill will enhance legal options on a federal level to help
stem a significant piece of why so many women and children are forced into the sex trade in Chicago and
Cook County: the pimps and traffickers; and
WHEREAS, in October of 2007, the Cook County Commission on Women’s Issues released the report,
“The Realities of Trafficking” in Cook County that documented the scope of the problem in Cook
County; and
WHEREAS, sixty-two percent of women and girls in prostitution in Illinois were first pimped out before
they were 18 and one third of women and girls in prostitution first become involved before age 15; many
adult women in Illinois are also trafficked and pimped by third parties who financially profit from
keeping them in prostitution; the majority of these adult women would face violence if they did not give
the money they make in the sex trade to these third parties; and
WHEREAS, pimps and traffickers do not always use force, fraud or coercion to bring adult women into
prostitution, but pimping and trafficking is always unlawful, and it is virtually always practiced on
previously harmed, notably vulnerable and objectively disempowered women; and
WHEREAS, seventy-five percent of women and girls in prostitution in Illinois are survivors of sexual
assault, most of multiple rapes and sixty-six percent are victims of incest; and
WHEREAS, fifty percent of women and girls in prostitution are homeless; often trading sex is the only
means of survival for these women and girls; pimps and traffickers often exploit these economic
hardships to maintain adults and children in prostitution; many traffickers and pimps profit from the
commercial sexual exploitation while the women and children trafficked remain poor.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County does
hereby condemn the trafficking of human beings and support efforts to prosecute those who profit from
the exploitation of women and children; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County does hereby
commend the U.S. House of Representatives and the Cook County delegation for their leadership in
expanding federal anti-trafficking legislation so that it more accurately represents the experiences of
victims in Cook County and expands the ability of federal prosecutors to bring domestic traffickers to
justice; and

6226

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 3, 2008
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County does hereby urge
United State Senators Richard J. Durbin and Barack Obama to support HR 3887 and the United States
Senate to pass the measure without modification; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that suitable copies of this Resolution be forwarded to United States
Senators Richard J. Durbin and Barack Obama.

6314

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 3, 2008
Your Committee has considered the following items and upon adoption of this report, the
recommendations are as follows:
294137

BUREAU OF TECHNOLOGY, by Antonio Hylton, Chief Information Officer, transmitting
a Communication:
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with NTT/VERIO,
INC., Chicago, Illinois, for unlimited, secure, dedicated internet access throughout Cook
County’s wide area network and web hosting services with the option for two (2) one-year
renewals.
Reason:

After completion of a Request for Proposal (RFP) process for the selection of an
Internet Service Provider, NTT/Verio, Inc. is being recommended based on its
technical capability, qualified personnel, prior demonstrated responsiveness, and
lowest cost to the County.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $188,412.00. Contract period: June 1, 2008 through May 31,
2009. (009-260 Account). Requisition No. 80090009.
Approval of this item would commit Fiscal Year 2008 funds.
* Referred to the Committee on Information Technology & Automation on May 20,
2008.
Commissioner Goslin, seconded by Vice Chairman Gorman, moved the approval of
Communication No. 294137. The motion carried unanimously.
294138

BUREAU OF TECHNOLOGY, by Antonio Hylton, Chief Information Officer, transmitting
a Communication:
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with U.S.
GEOLOGICAL SURVEY, Urbana, Illinois, to procure aerial photography.
Reason:

This joint funding agreement represents the work of a consortium involving the
federal government, seven (7) counties of Northeastern Illinois and a regional
council of governments to procure aerial photography for the benefit of each
agency. Because of the economy of scale and the philosophy of good
government, Cook County will realize a savings of approximately $500,000.00
over the cost should the county have acquired it solely. This consortium and this
project are unprecedented as a resource and data sharing initiative.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $181,583.00. Contract period: February 1, 2008 through
September 30, 2009. (545-260 Account). Requisition No. 85450011.
Sufficient funds are available through the Geographic Information Systems Fund.

07-41-350 with GREAT ARC TECHNOLOGIES, INC., Chicago, Illinois, for the one-time
acquisition to perform application migration services for the Department of Office
Technology.
Reason:
This request is necessary to expend the remaining funds on this contract. Great
Arc Technologies, Inc., who was originally selected through the Request for Proposal (RFP)
process, will be used to perform geodatabase enhancements to incorporate the latest archiving
solution for the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) environment. Approximately
$120,954.80 remains on this contract. The expiration date of the current contract was January
31, 2008.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Committee on Legislation, Intergovernmental & Veterans Relations of the Board of Commissioners
of Cook County met pursuant to notice on Wednesday, May 28, 2008 at the hour of 10:00 A.M. in the
Board Room, Room 569, County Building, 118 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois.
Your Committee has considered the following item and upon adoption of this report, the
recommendations is as follows:
294146

CANDIDATES FOR THE INTERIM BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE COOK COUNTY
BUREAU OF HEALTH (ADDITIONAL APPOINTMENTS).
Transmitting a
Communication from Todd H. Stroger, President, Cook County Board of Commissioners,
dated May 15, 2008.
With the restructuring and reorganization of the Bureau of Health Services, the passage of
adequate new revenue found in the 2008 Budget and an agreement on the legislation needed
to establish an independent hospital governance, the County Board, under my leadership, is
poised to take the next step, in a series of positive steps, to preserve the Cook County Health
Care System.

6317

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 3, 2008
As this process moves forward, it is important to affirm that all of the parties involved have
worked with genuine concern for the long-term well-being of our health system. The
organizations which participated in the Nominating Committee did a tremendous job in
forwarding a solid group of individuals. Additionally, I believe the County Board did their
duty in analyzing the nominees presented by this administration. This is not a perfect process
(and it is not enough to merely vote “no”), but it is the process we must move forward in
order to ensure that our children’s generation has universal access to quality health care in
Cook County.
Based on the amendments passed by the Board to the Cook County Health and Hospitals
System Ordinance, I am transmitting the names of four additional persons to serve:
•

David Ansell, M.D., M.P.H.: Chief Medical Officer, Associate Dean and Vice President
of Hospital Affairs, Rush University Medical Center;

•

Warren L. Batts: Retired Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Premark International;

•

Sister Sheila Lyne, R.S.M.: President and Chief Executive Officer, Mercy Hospital
Medical Center; and

•

Luis Munoz, M.D., M.P.H.: Director of Occupational Medicine, WorkCare Medical
Management

Their vast experience in health care administration, as well as their backgrounds in both the
public and private sectors, will be much-needed assets. I am confident that these four
individuals will bring professional and independent oversight and I therefore urge the Board
of Commissioners to provide for their swift confirmation.
* Referred to the Committee on Legislation, Intergovernmental & Veterans Relations
on May 20, 2008.
Chairman Suffredin explained the procedures that would be used for the meeting. First, testimony from
the public would be taken on all proposed nominees. Next, each proposed nominee would provide a brief
presentation of their qualifications, after which Committee members would be given the opportunity to
ask questions of the proposed nominee. Finally, the Committee members would take a roll call vote on
each proposed nominee after all had presented to the Committee.
The proposed nominees presented in the following order:
