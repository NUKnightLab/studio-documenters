 PERMIT REVIEW COMMITTEE REPORT TO
COMMISSION ON CHICAGO LANDMARKS
April 7, 2011
The Permit Review Committee (PRC) met on March 3, 2011, at 1:55 p.m. The meeting was held
at 33 N. LaSalle Street, Room 1600.
Present:

Ben Weese
John Baird
Phyllis Ellin
Ed Torrez
Ernest Wong

Staff:

Brian Goeken, Deputy Commissioner, Historic Preservation Division, Department
of Zoning and Land Use Planning
Dijana Cuvalo
Beth Johnson
Cynthia Roubik
Lawrence Shure

The following projects were reviewed by the PRC:
1.

Pullman District
(9th Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed accepted replacement window configurations in North Pullman.

Action:

Little in the way of physical or architectural evidence exists for historic
window configurations in North Pullman, although both undivided as well
as divided-light, double-hung windows appear to have existed during the
district’s period of significance. Of the few historic windows that remain,
most appear to be early replacements. In South Pullman, for which more
evidence exists, a variety of original and early historic windows can be
documented, but varies based on the building type, location, etc., in the
district; and may not be directly applicable to North Pullman.
Given the lack of extant historic windows and historical documentation for
historic window configurations, the Committee unanimously accepted the
following window configurations in North Pullman as meeting the
Commission’s adopted standards and guidelines: (1) one-over-one,
undivided double-hung windows and (2) divided-light, double-hung
windows. Replacement windows should be wood or clad-wood. For
divided-light windows, the number and configuration of the lights should
be determined on a case-by-case basis using available physical evidence,

 historical documentation, historic character, and any precedents relevant to
the subject property.
2.

1739 N. North Park
(Old Town Triangle District – 43rd Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed new curb cut to accommodate a parking space in the rear yard of
a corner two-unit residential property.

Action:

Five of seven properties on the south side of the block of Willow Street
between North Park Avenue and Crilly Court, which includes the subject
property, have existing curb cuts (one-car to four-cars wide) leading to
garages. The proposed project is a curb cut and one-car parking pad at the
rear of the subject property, a corner property which fronts on North Park
Avenue.
Given the specific circumstances and conditions, the Committee voted 3-2
(Phyllis Ellin and Ernest Wong voted against), in this limited instance that
the proposed one-car curb cut would not have an adverse effect on the
significant historical and architectural features of the landmark district,
subject to the following conditions and Historic Preservation staff review
and approval:
1. The parking space shall be located behind the setback line of the north
façade of the building (the side setback along Willow street, a distance
of approximately 7.18 feet); and shall be screened from the street by a
fence and landscaping to the extent reasonably possible. Any new
fence and gate shall be open metal or wood, and be no taller than 5’-0”
in height. A landscape plan and fence details shall be submitted for
Historic Preservation staff review and approval with the permit
application; and,
2. Individual brick pavers or similar unit pavers (other than, e.g., concrete
or asphalt) shall be used for the driveway and the parking space to
minimize the visual appearance and impact on the historic character of
the district.

3.

447 W. Roslyn
(Arlington and Roslyn Place District – 43rd Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed 9-ft-wide curb cut and driveway with a fenced-in one-car
parking space in the front/side yard of a 3-story, masonry single-family
residence.

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following findings:

 A) Preliminarily found that the proposed 9-ft-wide curb cut and driveway
leading to parking in the front and side yards of the subject property
would not meet the Commission’s adopted criteria, standards, and
guidelines (including guidelines specifically pertaining to curb cuts,
adopted on March 4, 1992); curb cuts are not characteristic of the
original development of the district, and the proposed curb cut and
parking pad would have an adverse effect on the significant historical
and architectural features of the landmark district;
B) Found that, pursuant to Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act
of 1990 governing state and local government programs and services,
the Commission is bound to “reasonably modify its policies, practices,
or procedures to avoid discrimination…[unless] the public entity can
demonstrate, however, that the modifications would fundamentally
alter the nature of its service, program, or activity, it is not required to
make the modification”;
C) Found that the proposed project, if temporary and being easily
reversible, and with the following conditions, would not fundamentally
alter the nature of the Commission’s service, program, or activity in
this limited instance of allowing the proposed curb cut and driveway in
the Arlington and Roslyn Place, a district which has no alley access to
otherwise provide comparable access to the property; and, therefore,
D) Found that the proposed project, given these circumstances and
conditions including those directly related to the resident’s
impairment, may be approved as a reasonable modification relative to
the Commission’s adopted guidelines in this limited instance with the
following conditions:
a. A 6’-0”-tall solid fence to screen the parking space from the street
shall be installed to align with the northeast corner of the building
(approximately 9’ from the front property line) and the parking
space shall not extend beyond the front façade of the building. An
elevation drawing of the proposed fence shall be submitted with
the permit application for Historic Preservation staff review and
approval. If an automatic gate is proposed, additional information
regarding the gate shall be submitted for review and approval as
part of the permit application;
b. Individual brick pavers or similar unit pavers (other than, e.g.,
concrete or asphalt) shall be used for the driveway to minimize the
visual appearance and impact on the historic character of the
building and district;
c. The project, as proposed, will require zoning variances or
adjustments, and the Commission takes no position regarding any
requested variance/adjustment relative to the zoning code
requirements;

 d. This approval is conditioned upon the specific family
circumstances as submitted and shall be considered revoked upon
the discontinuance of such conditions, such as, but not limited to,
the sale of the property or should the impaired family member no
longer reside at the property. In event of such occurrence, the
owner shall notify the Historic Preservation staff, and at the
owner’s sole expense, the curb must be restored and the sidewalk
and landscaping in the public way returned to the prior condition;
and,
e. The new curb cut will require a permit from the City’s Department
of Transportation and approval from the Commission on Chicago
Landmarks. As part of the permit application, the applicant shall
submit a signed affidavit, to be reviewed and approved by Historic
Preservation staff, acknowledging and agreeing to these conditions
of approval. The City, or at the City’s option the owner, will
record the final affidavit at the owner’s expense.
4.

833 N. Dearborn
(Washington Square District Extension – 42nd Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed replacement of 8 windows on the front façade of a single-family
row house

Action:

The Committee voted unanimously to preliminarily find that: (i)
the building is a contributing building to the character of the
landmark district; and (ii) the configuration of the proposed
replacement windows is inconsistent with the original character
of the building and the general historic and architectural
character of the district. The Committee therefore preliminarily
found that the project as proposed would have an adverse effect
on the significant historical and architectural features of the
building and the district.
To bring the project into conformance with the adopted standards and
avoid an adverse effect, the Committee advised that the applicant could
revise the proposed project as follows:
1. The existing windows may be retained and repaired; or,
2. The windows may be replaced with new one-over-one double-hung
wood or clad-wood windows. New brick molds with an exterior
profile matching the historic profile may be incorporated, but, in this
limited instance, are not required; alternatively, new brick molds may
match the brick mold profiles (also with a typical historic profile) of
the recently replaced windows on the attached three row houses built
at the same time and of the same design as the subject property.
Window details shall be submitted with the permit application for

 Historic Preservation staff review and approval prior to order and
installation.
5.

1025 N. Dearborn
(Washington Square District Extension – 42nd Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed replacement of front façade sandstone cladding with new
sandstone to match, including rebuilding the front porch and stair

Action:

The Committee voted 3-1 (Edward Torrez against and John
Baird abstained) that the project, with the following conditions,
would not have an adverse effect on the significant historical
and architectural features of the landmark district; and
preliminarily approved the project, including the replacement of
the deteriorated sandstone façade, given its condition, with new
sandstone to match, subject to these conditions and Historic
Preservation staff review and approval:
1. As proposed, the replacement sandstone shall be ‘Royal
Red’ sandstone and shall match the size, coursing, details,
finish, texture and appearance of the existing sandstone
cladding;
2. As proposed, the existing cornice and decorative stone
elements to be retained shall be carefully removed, salvaged,
repaired, and reinstalled in their original locations on the
façade. A dismantlement plan addressing the
documentation/labeling, salvage, and storing of the cornice
and decorative sandstone pieces shall be submitted to
Historic Preservation staff for review and approval with the
permit application;
3. As currently proposed, some courses of replacement masonry units at
each end of the front façade will straddle the subject property and the
adjacent attached row houses. Should this proposed scope of work
change to avoid having new masonry units straddling property lines,
such changes to the scope of work shall be submitted for Historic
Preservation staff review and approval;
4. The existing decorative wood door surround shall be retained and
repaired or, if beyond repair, replaced with new wood surrounds to
match the existing in size and profile. New entry doors shall be
installed in the same location as historic doors, and details of the new
wood entry doors and trim shall be submitted with the permit plans;
5. As proposed, the existing windows shall be replaced with new oneover-one, double-hung wood windows. The replacement windows
shall fit within the entire masonry opening, and proposed window
details shall be submitted with the permit application; and,

 6. The following shall be submitted to Historic Preservation staff for
review and approval with the permit application:
 Existing and proposed brick mold details. The proposed brick
molds shall match the existing in size and profile;
 Proposed cornice repair details;
 Proposed sandstone repair details and specifications for the
decorative stone units proposed to be retained and reused;
 Proposed sandstone cleaning specifications. All cleaning shall be
done with the gentlest method to avoid damaging the sandstone;
and,
 Proposed sandstone attachment details.
