GENERAL BACKGROUND
The Office of Development Management (“ODM”) solicited proposals for the renovation of
Pomeroy Apartments, constructed in 1923. Once completed, it will return one-hundred-four
(104) public housing opportunities to the Chicago Housing Authority’s (“CHA”) senior citizen
community plus a management apartment. Following complete interior demolition, the
renovation work required in this nine (9) story building includes replacement of mechanical
infrastructure, newly configured floor plans and common areas, exterior work that includes
window and door replacement and selective masonry repair. The work also includes all upgrades
needed to meet local codes, ADA accessibility compliance, as well as energy efficient
components intended to achieve LEED Certification, and provide eligible basis for energy tax
credits.
The CHA currently owns the Pomeroy Apartments, a public housing senior building located at
5650 North Kenmore Avenue in Chicago (the “Property”). The CHA intends to transfer
ownership of the Property to the Pomeroy Senior Housing Limited Partnership (the “Owner”).
The Owner will be comprised of a Limited Partner (99.991%) represented by a private tax credit
investor and a General Partner (.009%) represented by Pomeroy Housing Development, LLC, of
which CHA will be the sole member. Upon closing of the transfer of the Property to the Owner,
the CHA will assign the construction contract to the Owner. The Property will be redeveloped as
a mixed-financed project. CHA will provide collateral for a construction loan and fund a
permanent loan, and leverage additional project funding including equity from Low Income
Housing Tax Credits. As the General Partner, the CHA will facilitate the transaction and operate
the project as public housing.

 PROCUREMENT HISTORY
The CHA released RFP No. 10-00493 for the renovation of the Pomeroy Apartments on
February 24, 2010. Eighty-five (85) firms picked up or downloaded the solicitation. The RFP
was advertised in the Chicago Sun-Times, Chicago Defender, El Dia and on the CHA Website as
well as BuySpeed online on February 24, 2010. A Pre-Bid Conference and site visit was held at
Pomeroy Apartments and CHA Offices at 60 E. Van Buren, 13th Floor on March 4, 2010.
Addendum No. 1 was issued on March 15, 2010 to update the drawings and technical
specifications and schedule a second site visit for March 17, 2010. Addendum No. 2 was issued
on March 18, 2010 to respond to the RFIs received by March 9, 2010, update the Schedule of
Change Order Prices and to extend the proposal due date. Addendum No. 3 was issued on
March 23, 2010, to respond to a second round of RFIs received by March 18, 2010, revise the fee
proposal pages and to extend the proposal due date. Addendum No. 4 was issued on March 30,
2010 to extend the proposal due date. And the last addendum, Addendum No. 5 was issued on
April 1, 2010 to update the Fee Proposal Form. Nine (9) proposals were received on April 5,
2010. Proposals were reviewed for responsiveness and evaluated and scored. Six (6) firms placed
in the competitive range set by the Director of Procurement.
EXPLANATION
In selecting a general contractor, the evaluators considered each respondent’s work plan, past
performance related to rehabilitating low income housing tax credit - multi-housing
developments, experience with LEED certification, quality control and assurance plans,
construction schedule, contract administration capability and relationship with subcontractors
and material suppliers. Because this project is funded in part through the American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), the evaluators also considered each respondent’s
demonstrated knowledge of the reporting requirements of ARRA.
The McHugh Construction Co. scored highest for its overall approach to the project, having a
strong balance of experience performing as a general contractor on residential development
projects that have attained LEED certification as well as development projects utilizing mixedfinancing and ARRA funding.
Based on the foregoing, it is in the best interest of CHA to enter into a firm fixed-fee contract
with McHugh Construction Company in the amount of $17,750,000 for general contractor
services at Pomeroy Apartments (IL2-039), a senior housing building located at 5650 North
Kenmore Avenue, for a 12 month construction period from the date set forth in the Notice to
Proceed, and to assign the contract to Pomeroy Senior Housing Limited Partnership.
This award is subject to the Contractor’s compliance with CHA’s MBE/WBE/DBE, Section 3
resident hiring, bonding and insurance requirements as well as all applicable provisions of
ARRA, including the Buy American provision.
