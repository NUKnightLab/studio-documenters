Summary: In 2013, Cook County leveraged pricing discounts available to volume purchasers by
aggregating its technology needs with the City of Chicago. A joint City-County RFP was issued and
representatives from both government entities recommended that CDW Government LLC be awarded.
The contract allows County elected official IT departments to procure necessary software and equipment
through an online ordering system.

 This Board subsequently approved a contract increase in 2015 to facilitate grant-funded purchases by the
Department of Homeland Security, and additional purchases for other offices under the President and
separately elected officials. The Board next approved an increase and first of two (2) renewal options
available in the contract to allow County agencies to continue to procure necessary software and
equipment in 2016. Both contract increases were accompanied by corresponding amendments to reduce
the mark-up cost for any newly added software items.
The Bureau of Technology now requests the second of two (2) renewal option for one-year and increase
to the contract in order to sustain County IT requirements for all elected official IT departments while an
ongoing replacement RFP process is completed.
This contract was awarded through a competitive Request for Proposal (RFP) process in accordance with
the Cook County Procurement Code. CDW Government was awarded based on established evaluation
criteria.
