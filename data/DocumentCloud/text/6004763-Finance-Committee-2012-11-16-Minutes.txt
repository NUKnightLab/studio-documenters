Policy, and Matt Powers of Health Management Associates (HMA). Additionally, she thanked County Board
President Toni Preckwinkle, Julie Hamos, Director of the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services,
and their staffs for their assistance. She stated that this is a huge accomplishment and a tremendous opportunity for
the System.

III. Action Items
A. Minutes of the Finance Committee Meeting, October 19, 2012
Director Michael, seconded by Director Golden, moved to accept the minutes of the
Finance Committee Meeting of October 19, 2012. THE MOTION CARRIED
UNANIMOUSLY.

B. Contracts and Procurement Items (Attachment #1)
Gina Besenhofer, System Director of Supply Chain Management, presented the requests for the Committee’s
consideration. She noted that request number 15 is being withdrawn, as it is a duplicate of an item that was
already approved in September. Additionally, she stated that request numbers 13, 14 and 17 are currently
pending review by the County’s Office of Contract Compliance. The Committee reviewed and discussed the
requests presented for their consideration.
The following individuals presented additional information on the requests: Dr. Sandra Martell, Interim Chief
Operating Officer of the Cook County Department of Public Health; Susan Greene, System Interim Director of
Managed Care; Dr. Claudia Fegan, Chief Medical Officer of John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County; and
Dr. Terry Mason, System Chief Medical Officer.
In response to a question from Director Michael regarding whether the services for which the System is
receiving a grant under request number 2 are mandated, Dr. Martell responded that they are not. Board
Chairman Carvalho noted that when the requests relating to the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH)
come before the Board, he will be abstaining. He asked for further information on the subcontractors
associated with request number 2. Ms. Martell stated that IDPH presents the Cook County Department of
Public Health (CCDPH) with hospital partners and agencies that are interested in providing these services.
CCDPH is funded predominantly for suburban Cook County. The northern partner is St. Alexius Medical
Center in Hoffman Estates, and the Maternal Child Health Program, also located in Hoffman Estates. For the
western suburban area, the partner is Rush Oak Park; for the south suburban area, it is Ingalls Memorial
Hospital. Clients are also served out of the Ambulatory and Community Health Network of Cook County
(ACHN) clinics; the suburban clinics refer to CCDPH directly for this service.
With regard to request number 13, Ms. Green provided an overview of the responsibilities expected as part of
the contract for third party administrator services. Some of the responsibilities include the following: member
service functions; provider relations functions; building interface between the System and the State; member
education; data reporting; and claims processing. Board Chairman Carvalho noted that the Board will be
receiving a comprehensive presentation on the Section 1115 Waiver Implementation as a Board Education
Item at the November 29th Meeting; he anticipates that the presentation will generate many topics for further
follow-up discussion and review by for the Finance and Human Resources Committees.
Also with regard to request number 13, Director Golden asked whether there were any other vendors who
responded to the request for proposals (RFP) for this contract. Ms. Greene stated that there were four (4) other
vendors who responded to the RFP.

III. Action Items
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)
With regard to request number 14, as it relates to blood and blood product usage, Director Michael asked
whether the System has recently reviewed the subject of management of blood products; he noted that there are
a lot of indications that other health systems are doing a better job at managing blood products in order to use
less product. Dr. Fegan stated that this subject has been a topic of discussion among the medical staff at the
System. A goal has been set for next year to decrease the use of blood product within the Department of
Surgery; she noted that they are looking at several modalities in which to approach that goal. Director Michael
requested that an update on the subject be provided at a future meeting of the Quality and Patient Safety
Committee1. Dr. Mason added that this subject was discussed at a recent forum of Chief Medical Officers that
was hosted by the Metropolitan Chicago Healthcare Council.
Ms. Besenhofer provided an update on activities relating to the provision of janitorial services at the ACHN
clinics. She stated that the Board recently approved a request to amend the contract with Sodexo for the
provision of these services. As the administration was not able to come to mutually agreeable terms with
Sodexo, an emergency contract with Jani-King was entered into for the provision of these services, in an
amount under $150,000.
Director Golden, seconded by Director Michael, moved the approval of request
numbers 1 through 17, with the exception of request number 15, which was
withdrawn, under the Contracts and Procurement Items. THE MOTION CARRIED.
Director Michael abstained and voted PRESENT on request number 16.

C. Any items listed under Sections III and IV
IV. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
A. Financial Reports through October 2012 (Attachment #2)
Dorothy Loving, System Executive Director of Finance, presented the Financial Reports through October
2012. The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
During the discussion regarding possible ways to reduce the number of days for patient bills to remain in the
Accounts Receivable system, several factors that influence that number were discussed. John Cookinham,
System Chief Financial Officer, stated that at the end of November, the average number of days for a bill to
remain in Accounts Receivable was one hundred fifty-four (154); this year, they are hoping to level off that
number to one hundred twenty (120) days. Ninety (90) days are already built in to the self-pay number of days,
as the System is required to send three (3) notices to the patient to try to collect. Coding time is also included.
Mr. Cookinham indicated that the true self-pay collection cycle is approximately one hundred thirty-five (135)
days. For those patients who qualify for CareLink and who qualify for 100% discount, their bills write down
to a zero amount at the point of billing, so some of the self-pay accounts do not receive a bill; this allows the
System to reduce that category.
Board Chairman Carvalho noted that, if all of the System’s patients were going through CareLink, wouldn’t
almost all of the self-pay patients qualify for a discount under CareLink? Mr. Cookinham responded that if the
System’s self-pay population qualified for 100% discount, that would radically reduce that category.

IV. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
A. Financial Reports through October 2012 (continued)
Mr. Cookinham provided additional information regarding the process of sending statements to patients. He
stated that Medicare reimburses bad debts; to the extent that an organization does not treat everyone the same,
then the organization is not allowed to claim those bad debts. So, the System would bill Medicare, and a
portion of it would be the responsibility of the patient to pay. Three (3) statements would be sent for the
patient to pay; if those statements were ignored, they would go to the collection agency.
Board Chairman Carvalho inquired regarding the level of income that qualifies a patient for 100% discount
under CareLink. Mr. Cookinham responded that he believes it is approximately 250% of poverty; he stated
that he will provide the document that outlines that information to the Committee2. He noted that, currently,
over 90% of the people who qualify for CareLink qualify for 100% discount.
The Committee discussed the subject of screening patients for CareLink eligibility. Mr. Cookinham stated
that, currently, screening is essentially performed at the request of the patient; he added that fifty thousand
(50,000) patients have been enrolled in CareLink. Board Chairman Carvalho inquired as to the percentage of
the patients overall that are screened for CareLink. Mr. Cookinham responded that he will try to develop that
number and provide that information to the Committee3.
The Committee discussed the subject of enrolling patients into the CareLink Program. Mr. Cookinham stated
that CareLink is, in a sense, a voluntary program. Board Chairman Carvalho stated that this subject has been
previously discussed, and it is understood that the System does not currently have the resources to enroll every
patient seen by the System; however, the policy is to require the application for enrollment in the CareLink
Program from all patients.
Chairman O’Donnell noted that with the Waiver activities, she assumes that the System is going to be
aggressive in trying to get everybody who is eligible to enroll in the Waiver program enrolled; through that
effort, are patients who do not qualify for the Waiver or for traditional Medicaid going to be then directed to
apply through the CareLink Program for assistance? Dr. Raju responded affirmatively; he indicated that when
the infrastructure is in place and the patient comes in, it is expected that they will qualify for one of the three
programs: traditional Medicaid, Medicaid Waiver, or CareLink Program.
Further discussion took place on the question of how to handle those patients with non-emergency medical
needs who refuse to participate in the enrollment process. Dr. Raju indicated that it is nearly impossible to
reach a 100% participation rate; he stated that the culture does need to change, but the process will definitely
improve, in order to increase the participation rate.
Chairman O’Donnell stated that part of the reason that the Board is in place is to change the culture of this
institution and the patients who come here; if we just say it’s too hard, then it won’t change. She stated that the
Board is expecting the administration to enforce the policies that the Board has made very clear; that involves a
culture change, which takes time, but the System needs to move in that direction.
In order for enrollment efforts to be successful and to get patients to comply with the enrollment requirements,
Director Butler stated that there needs to be a culture change at both ends of the spectrum, with both System
personnel and with the patient. He stated that if the patient trusts the System, they will join – if they
understand and trust that enrollment will prevent many headaches by avoiding receiving bills and calls from
collection agencies, they will join.

IV. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
A. Financial Reports through October 2012 (continued)
Director Butler inquired whether there is a way to shorten the ninety (90) day period of time that is built in to
the Accounts Receivable figure to allow for the three (3) statements to be sent. Mr. Cookinham responded that
it is unlikely; however, it is possible to enroll more people into the CareLink Program to offset that number.
He stated that the best goal is to get as many people as possible enrolled into the Waiver and/or CareLink
Program. He stated that the administration is committed to do that. They are going to revise the application
process and try to streamline it. Additionally when the eligibility vendor enrolls a patient for the Waiver and
then determines that person is ineligible, they would have essentially collected the same information that would
be necessary to process a CareLink application, so the goal is to either get a Waiver application completed or a
CareLink application completed. He added that he believes that the System will be much more effective in that
than it has been in the past.
Director Velasquez inquired regarding outreach efforts and activities for enrollment, and asked whether efforts
have focused upon reaching people at community organizations, such as churches. Dr. Raju responded that an
RFP is in process to identify outreach organizations. Additionally, he stated that the administration is working
with a group to get the messaging correct. That will be a major outreach effort; with those things happening,
more and more people will understand the benefits of enrollment.
Director Michael stated that if patients have the impression that they can get the same care in the same way,
whether or not they enroll in one of the programs, there will be a group of people who decide that they will not
bother enrolling. He noted that the Board will have to come back to this question at some point - for those
patients who are willing to take the time to work with the System to enroll in these programs, is the System
going to give those patients care and not provide it for others (for non-emergency medical services) who will
not go through the enrollment process? Dr. Raju agreed; however, he added that this is a process, and the
patients need to be educated.
Board Chairman Carvalho stated that it is not just an issue of what has been discussed today, but as the State
implements managed care coordination for 50% of the Medicaid population, there is going to be a large portion
of the Medicaid population that is no longer going to have the freedom to go wherever they want; they will
have to go where the managed care directs. To the extent that these people do not want to go where their
managed care directs, and they choose to come here, that will be a whole other abuse of the process. If the
System does not have a self-defense mechanism in place, the System will find itself in a situation in which it
will not get paid for those patients who come here, who are covered by Medicaid but are required to go
somewhere else for their care. The System only has a certain amount of resources, and is able to serve only so
many people; he asked if the System should be serving the people who do not have choices, or should it be
serving the people who have choices but who choose not to go through with those choices. Having rules and
enforcing them conserves the System’s resources for those who do not have choices. With regard to enforcing
the rules, he stated that the Board is saying mandatory enforcement - not tomorrow, but eventually; education
should precede it, but mandatory enforcement should eventually take place.
Dr. Raju stated that he is working with Ms. Greene on the process moving forward. In response to a question
from Director Golden regarding whether information can be collected on the reason for non-compliance from
those patients who refuse to enroll, Dr. Raju stated that they can try to collect that information.
Ms. Loving continued with the review of the financial reports. In response to a question from Mr. Oder
regarding the deficit of $53 million recorded in the month of October, Ms. Loving stated that there is an overall
budget to actual revenue deficit. The System did not meet what was budgeted for revenue for 2012, but a lot
of that has to do with the fact that the System has not received the amount of Medicaid revenue that was
expected on the patient fee side.

IV. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
A. Financial Reports through October 2012 (continued)
Going forward, Director Michael stated that it would be helpful to take a little more time to look ahead a
quarter or so, particularly now that the new budget has been confirmed. He requested for the next meeting and
going forward, that the Committee receive information to review the projections based on the budget for the
coming quarter, and include any anticipated changes or additional information on what is currently expected to
be collected4. Chairman O’Donnell added that this information will be beneficial to also provide a sense of
whether the System is doing a good job of coordinated care and keeping costs within the per-member permonth formula.
Mr. Oder inquired as to the reason for the $17 million increase in salaries and wages at Stroger Hospital. Mr.
Cookinham responded that he will return to the Committee with that information5. He noted that the issue may
be impacted by how the System is calculating the accrual for salaries and wages. Another reason could relate
to the amount of overtime that may have been needed for the preparations for the survey by The Joint
Commission.
With regard to the charts on pages 30 and 31, Board Chairman Carvalho noted that the figures relate to persons
rather than dollars; he asked whether information for those fields can include the budgeted figures for the years
2011, 2012 and 2013. Mr. Cookinham responded that he can provide that information6.
B. Update on the following projects:
i. Section 1115 Medicaid Waiver
This subject was discussed during the Committee’s review of the Contracts and Procurement Items;
additionally, the Board will be receiving a comprehensive presentation on the Section 1115 Waiver
Implementation as a Board Education Item at the November 29th Meeting.
ii. Global Healthcare Exchange (GHX) contract management /electronic exchange system
Ms. Besenhofer provided a brief update on the implementation of the GHX system. She stated that staff
continues to fill in gaps of information in the system; she noted that this project involves building an item
master and vendor master from scratch. Staff continues to address challenges and changes in the process; they
continue to evaluate from a roll-out perspective what makes the most sense. She stated that the first round of
unit testing has been completed; hundreds of scenarios were run by Supply Chain staff with oversight of the
consultants. She was pleased to report that it was a great learning experience; a 98% success rate was
achieved in running the scenarios. The plan to go live with the system at the beginning of January is still ontrack.
Dr. Raju stated that it has been a very big task to build this system from scratch, as the System did not have the
infrastructure or data. He noted that there may be some functionality that may need to be delayed. Staff will
continue to work on getting all of the functionality in place by the beginning of January, but this was a larger
project than was anticipated. Director Michael stated that, as these capabilities are built and as more is learned,
it may be necessary to modify the direction a bit or to look at additional functionality that may be needed. He
encouraged Ms. Besenhofer to return to the Committee upon reaching the milestones to give the Committee an
update and to tell the Committee if she thinks that the direction needs to be changed a bit.

IV. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
B. Update on the following projects: (continued)
iii. Meaningful Use
Dr. Bala Hota, System Interim Chief Information Officer, provided a brief update on Meaningful Use. He
stated that the big item that was needed to be completed in order to achieve Meaningful Use for the eligible
providers of the ACHN clinic physicians is E-prescribing. The system is now System-wide live for all
providers for the ability to do electronic prescribing, both to the System pharmacies and to external
pharmacies. Each day there are over two thousand (2,000) prescriptions that are prescribed electronically
using this new method; he noted that the System’s failure rate is right along the national average of just under
2%.
Training tools are available within Cerner itself, within the electronic record, that are accessible to all
providers. Additionally, reports have been built that are available on an internal intranet-based website which
went live yesterday; any provider can log into the website to see how they are doing on a dashboard.
In response to questions from Director Michael regarding the future requirements that will need to be
implemented for Meaningful Use, Dr. Hota stated that Meaningful Use is like an escalator. Step one is
stepping on the escalator, but then the requirements quickly go up and you get carried up the escalator. In the
first stage, there were several items that were optional; however, those become mandatory in the second stage.
He noted that, for many of the requirements, they are low in the first stage, but those double or triple in the
second stage. The System’s approach has been as follows: let’s meet the requirements for the first stage, but
then we really have to use metrics, audit and feedback to really encourage an option across the provider staff.
Dr. Hota provided additional information on the strategy for the second stage. Concurrent with the
implementation and functionality, staff has been really focusing on how to build the metrics and dashboards,
and how to disseminate the information in an effective way. The plan is to have staff try to align this with
some other dashboard initiatives that are going on across the organization, and then particular teams will feed
back the information to the providers. He added that, right now, there is no final guidance on the third stage.
C. Committee Education – Capital Equipment Funding (Attachment #3)
Mr. Cookinham provided an overview of the information regarding capital equipment funding. The Committee
reviewed and discussed the information.
Director Michael inquired whether the Committee can receive information relating to the estimate of the
amount that the System is paying in financing costs for leasing equipment, versus what it would be paying if
the System had been able to buy the equipment. Mr. Cookinham responded that he can return to the
Committee with the information for a couple of items, and estimate what the rate that the System is paying for
it might be7. He stated that the real problem with operating leases and determining the rate paid is that the
lender does not fix the residual amount for the client; assumptions can be made of perhaps 20% for the residual
value and one can compute what the interest rate will be.
Mr. Cookinham stated that when the System uses this vehicle to acquire capital assets, it also then must
provide money each year in its operating expense budget for lease payments; he noted that when the System
purchases equipment through the County, the County is providing those funds. The County has essentially said
that until the current funds that have been borrowed have been consumed, they are not going to borrow any
additional money for funding capital. Leasing assets is something that the System has to do in order to acquire
what is needed for this period of time.

IV. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
C. Committee Education – Capital Equipment Funding (continued)
Chairman O’Donnell inquired how the determination is made regarding whether to go with the capital asset
through the County or through a capital lease. Mr. Cookinham responded that, on a go-forward basis, there
will need to be more formal guidelines.
The Committee discussed the percentage of assets (45%) of the total requests that are designated for Provident
Hospital and Oak Forest Health Center. Director Michael inquired whether this is in synch with the overall
strategy for the System. Mr. Cookinham responded that, according to the 2015 Vision, both Oak Forest Health
Center and Provident Hospital were intended to be outpatient centers that had the ability to provide complex
diagnostic services. A lot of the assets and equipment listed will provide the ability to do images and so forth
in an outpatient setting – they are not necessarily associated with the operation of an inpatient facility. Dr.
Raju added that this equipment will increase the System’s ability to be able to provide services to the 1115
Waiver population. Board Chairman Carvalho noted that, on page 31, the actual patient days at Provident
Hospital averages out to an average daily census of 16.9 patients per day. He stated that there should not be
anything included in the capital assets information for Provident Hospital that is not functional for an
outpatient center.
V.

 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
INTRODUCTION
This discussion and analysis provides the readers of the monthly unaudited financial
statements of the Cook County Health and Hospital System (CCHHS) with an overview
of the financial activities for the month ended October 31, 2012. This discussion focuses
on the significant financial issues and major financial activities during the current month.
It should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements of the
CCHHS.
The CCHHS includes the following entities: John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital (JSH), Oak
Forest Health Center (OFC) Provident Hospital (PHCC), the Department of Public Health
(DPH), the Ambulatory and Community Health Network (ACHN), the Bureau of Health
Services (BHS), CORE Center (for reporting purposes part of Stroger Hospital), and
Cermak Health Services (CHS). Collectively, these entities provide primary,
intermediate, acute, and tertiary medical care to patients, without regard to their ability to
pay. The Bureau of Health Services oversees the operational, planning, and policy
activities of the CCHHS.
The CCHHS is included in the reporting entity of the Cook County, Illinois, as an
enterprise fund. As an enterprise fund, the CCHHS’ financial statements are prepared
using proprietary fund accounting that focuses on the determination of changes in net
assets, financial position, and cash flows in a manner similar to private sector businesses.
The financial statements are prepared on an accrual basis of accounting, which
recognizes revenue when earned and expenses when incurred.
In 2008 the Cook County Health and Hospital System Board was created by the Cook
County Board of Commissioners to provide independent oversight of health care
operations, and in 2010 the Cook County Board of Commissioners voted to make the
Cook County Health and Hospital System Board permanent.
In 2010 the Cook County Health and Hospital System Board and the Cook County Board
of Commissioners approved Vision 2015 Strategic Plan, which outlines, over five years,
restructuring CCHHS to deliver the best possible care for the vulnerable population of
Cook County within the constraints of dollar resources available to the health system.
This plan seeks to better allocate resources.

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS (IN THOUSANDS)
The Cook County Health and Hospitals System finished the eleven months with overall
revenue of $810,966 and overall expenses was $873,411.
Net Patient revenue for the eleven months was $514,640.
5
Page 46 of 95

 Net Patient revenue consists of all charges including automated contractual allowances
and bad debt adjustments. Write-off of Bad Debt is a CCHHS Board approved policy.
Other revenue was $6,963. Other revenue consists primarily of parking revenue. The
$186 decrease in Department of Public Health’s other revenue is mostly due to correction
of erroneously recorded revenue in the previous period.

Patient Accounts Receivable – BEPA System Only
General
As compared to November 30, 2011, Total Patient Accounts Receivable at the end of
October-2012 reduced by 31 to 123 days. The 7 day decrease in this figure, as compared
to the previous month’s figure, is due largely to the one-time or first-time occurrence of
the following factors:




Movement of accounts with undeliverable addresses to the collection agency;
Correction of pharmacy charging issues; and
Transition of patients previously covered under the LOL program to the Carelink
program.

CCHHS continues to revise its processes with the eligibility vendor and performed
accounts receivable maintenance and clean-up that identified additional patient accounts
that should either be Carelink or collection agency accounts. This accounts for the large
change in balances during October-2012. This also was the primary reason for the
reduction in days of revenue outstanding.
Days of Revenue Outstanding measures the average number of days charges remain in
accounts receivable after service has been rendered before collection activities have been
completed, including charity care and bad debt write-offs. Days of Revenue Outstanding
is measured in charges, not cash collections.
Days of Revenue Outstanding is a useful tool to measure collection efforts over time (i.e.,
whether this number is growing or decreasing). This number will be large due to the
large number of Self-Pay patients CCHHS services and the processes CCHHS must
complete before patient accounts are collected or written-off to bad debt. These
processes include, but are not limited to, the following:






Making an effort to attain third-party insurance coverage;
Processing charity care applications;
Sending three (3) monthly statements before accounts are turned over to
collections;
Placing accounts bi-monthly with the collection agency; and
Permitting patients to pay their account balances over time (time payment).

Total billed accounts fell by $45.448M (12.8%) as compared to the November-2011
balance and also fell by $11.536 (3.6%) as compared to the prior month’s balance. This
6
Page 47 of 95

 figure has declined in eight (8) out of the last nine (9) months. The overall decline in this
figure indicates an increasing number of accounts are completing the collection process.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts, as
Medicaid pays CCHHS claims on a per-diem and Medicare pays CCHHS on the
diagnosis, regardless of charges on the patient accounts. Additionally, charity care and
bad debt write-offs will not result in actual cash collections.
Inpatient Accounts Receivable – BEPA System Only
Discharged Not Final Billed
Inpatient discharged but not final billed accounts at the end of Octover-2012 decreased
by $11.828M (55.8%) as compared the November 30, 2011 balance. This amount is less
than the previous month’s balance by $0.938M (9.1%) as well. This indicates that more
inpatient accounts are moving to a “Billed” status, as compared to the previous month.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts, as
Medicaid pays CCHHS’ claims on a per-diem and Medicare pays CCHHS’ claims on the
diagnosis, regardless of charges on the patient accounts. Additionally, charity care and
bad debt write-offs are part of the collection process and will not result in actual cash
collections.
Billed Inpatient Accounts
Billed inpatient accounts at the end of October-2012 decreased by $26.921M (14.0%) as
compared to the November 30, 2011 balance. This amount is less than the previous
month’s balance by $4.026M (2.4%).
The decrease in this number indicates more accounts had the collection process
completed than in the previous month and that more accounts are being removed from
active accounts receivable. CCHHS’ collection process includes charity care and bad
debt write-offs.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts, as
Medicaid pays on a per-diem and Medicare pays on the diagnosis, regardless of charges
on the patient accounts. Additionally, charity care and bad debt write-offs will not result
in actual cash collections.
Outpatient Accounts Receivable – BEPA System Only
Unbilled Outpatient Accounts
The balance of unbilled outpatient accounts decreased by $3.979M (17.8%) by the end of
October-2012, as compared to the level of unbilled accounts as of November 30, 2011.
This month’s balance decreased by $2.515M (12.0%). More outpatient accounts are
moving to a “Billed” status, as compared to the previous month. The reduction of
internal bill-holds from 20 days to 6 days will tend to cause a decline in the unbilled
accounts receivable.
7
Page 48 of 95

 The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts due
to Medicaid’s and Medicare’s reimbursement configuration.
Billed Outpatient Accounts
The billed outpatient accounts receivable at the end of October-2012 fell by $18.527M
(11.5%) over the balance as of November 30, 2011. This figure is smaller than the
previous month’s balance by $7.509M (5.0%).
The reduction in this figure, as compared to the prior month’s balance, indicates a greater
number of Out-Patient accounts had their collection and write-off related activities
completed.
The reduction of internal bill-holds from 20 days to 6 days will tend to cause a growth in
the billed accounts receivable.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts due
to Medicaid and Medicare’s reimbursement configuration and to charity care and bad
debt write-offs.
Carelink Program Activities (Charity Care)
The volume and dollar amounts written-off to charity care are as follows:

Operating Expenses at the end of eleven months was $873.411M broken down as
follows:
Salaries and Wages - $459.297M
Benefits - $132.445M
Supplies - $89.022M. The reduction of $0.963M in expense on the Bureau of Health is
the result of transfers of pharmaceuticals to Stroger, Oak Forest and Provident.
Purchased Services, Rental, and Other - $123.959M
Depreciation - $30.828M
Utilities - $10.123M
Insurance - $27.738M
8
Page 49 of 95

 Nonoperating Revenue was $289.363M. The largest portions of this are attributed to
sales tax in the amount of $68.049M, cigarette tax in the amount of $87.577M and
property tax in the amount of $74.011M. In the month of October, the Cook County
Comptroller’s Office made an adjustment to reduce sales tax by $39.039M and increase
cigarette tax by $41.399M thereby causing a net increase of $2.360M in nonoperating
revenue. They also recorded an additional $5.816M of other tobacco product tax revenue.
Sales tax revenues are recognized by CCHHS when earned; this occurs when the
underlying sales transactions occur. The amount recorded as Due from State of Illinois Sales Tax represents the amounts earned by CCHHS, however, the cash is not yet
received from the state. There is a 3 months lag from the time of the underlying sales
transaction to the receipt of funds.
Taxes collected for the Health to date have been fully credited to the Health Fund except
as mentioned in the previous paragraph.
OVERVIEW OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
This discussion and analysis are inelevended to serve as an introduction to the CCHHS
financial statements. CCHHS basic monthly unaudited financial statements are comprised
of fund financial statements.
A fund is a grouping of related accounts that is used to maintain control over resources
that have been segregated for specific activities or objectives. The CCHHS, like other
state and local governments, uses fund accounting to ensure and demonstrate compliance
with finance-related legal requirements.

The Medicaid fee-for-service revenue through the IGT covers the period beginning week ended 09/19/2012 - 10/17/2012 .
Vendor Payments From Revenue are payments out of revenue posted by the County Comptroller. Pharmacy Billing and Revenue Enhancement
payments are reductions to Medicaid revenue. Collection Agency payments are reductions to Self-Pay (Other) revenue. Physician Billing payments
include refunds processed by CCHHS. Included in the "Revenue Enhancement" total is a payment to the state for supplemental workers
hired to help clear the Medicaid backlog.
The Upper Payment Limit Revision is spread over 11 months, beginning Jan-2012, as it is not known in which month this payment will be received.
The "Medicaid Retroactive Payment" was budgeted all at SHCC.

Report of the Chief Financial Officer
October 2012

Page 76 of 95

 Capital Budget Update
  CCHHS defines Capital Equipment as items that cost more than $1,000 and have a useful

life greater than two years.
  Bulk purchases of items that are individually less than $1,000 are considered as a capital

purchase too. These items must still meet the useful life requirement.
  The useful lives of capital assets are determined through the use of the AHA guide for the

useful lives of healthcare capital assets.
  Depreciation after 2008 has been calculated on a straight-line basis.

2
Page 77 of 95

 Capital Budget Update
  CCHHS has capital needs and there are several ways those needs are going to be met in

2013.
  Cook County provides capital funds for CCHHS to purchase major moveable

equipment, complete improvements to plant and property, and acquire new technology.
  CCHHS has for several years used a credit facility with The Bank of America that allows

CCHHS to lease major moveable equipment. The 2013 budget plans on leasing capital
equipment. The leases are to be Fair Market Value leases. The lease factor is based on the
residual value and the term of the lease.
  The term of the leases is to be five years for most of the equipment except televisions

3

which is 3 years. The operating expense budget provided for lease payments for the
planned acquisitions. The lease payments for the items already acquired for which there
will be twelve months of lease payments is estimated to be $3,374,530. The lease
payment amount for equipment to be acquired in fiscal 2012-2013 is estimated to be an
additional $2,239,200.
Page 78 of 95

 Capital Budget Update
  CCHHS and the County Budget staff have been refining the capital equipment budget

request. The have been capital budget funds from prior years that have been unspent in
earlier periods.

  CCHHS Administration met and consolidated the requests from prior years and updated

the requests for changes in System plans.

  The final consolidated capital budget requests of about 24 million dollars were submitted

to the County Budget Department. These requests will be incorporated in Cook County
plans for the use of available capital funding for major moveable equipment.

  A portion of the 24 million dollars was submitted to the Bureau of Technology. These

items included additional server hardware and software. This has been proposed to
increase the response time of the Cerner system. There were also requests for two
software systems to improve physician documentation and to increase coder productivity
under ICD-10. No final determination has been made by the County on these requests.

  A second list of capital items that were deferred for 2013 was submitted to the County

Budget Department. The items on this list would be funded if the County were able to
increase the capital funding for CCHHS in 2013.

4
Page 79 of 95

 Capital Budget Update
  In addition to the requests for major moveable equipment and improvements in

technology there have been requests submitted to Capital Planning for capital additions
and improvements to plant and property. Some of these items are needed to make
improvements to the environment of care to meet The Joint Commission requirements.
  The County is not planning on issuing new bonds for capital acquisition in 2013. There

has been a re-allocation of existing capital funds that will allow for the 2013 purchases.
  Operating leases provide another method for the Health System to meet some of its

outstanding capital needs that is independent of the County plans. Operating leases
require that the operating expense budget cover the cost of the current period lease
payments.
  The use of operating leases must also include a strategy about what to do at the end of the

lease term. Items at the end of the lease term must either be purchased at fair market
value, returned to the bank, or leased under a new agreement.

Page 80 of 95

 Capital Budget Update
  The consolidation of the prior year capital requests for capital was addressed by a

committee made up of the Chief Operating Officer, Interim Chief Clinical Officer, The
Chief Medical Officer, Stroger Hospital Chief Medical Officer, Director of Supply Chain
Management, Stroger Hospital Chief Financial Officer, System Budget Director, and the
System Chief Financial Officer. This group will become the Capital Acquisition
Committee. There will be additional members added to represent each of the existing
business units in CCHHS.
  The lists of proposed capital items when final are to be posted on Knowledge Web. There

will be the list of major moveable equipment Items, The list of deferred major moveable
equipment, and the list of equipment to be leased.
  All changes to the final lists of approved items need to be authorized by the Capital

Acquisition Committee and signed by the Chief Operating Officer and the System Chief
Financial Officer.
  The System Budget Director will be responsible for maintaining the capital lists in
