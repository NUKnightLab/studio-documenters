RE: Spring?eld Update End of Spring Session

DATE: Friday, June 1, 2018

The following is an end of Spring Session update:

HB 4413 (Ammons) (Manar) The Broadcast Meetings bill has been held in the Senate State
Government Committee at the request of its sponsor, Senator Andy Manar.


DrHB&LegID=109186&SessionlD=9l

 

HB 4811 (Zalewski) (Mulroe) The Duty Disability bill for MEABF was passed unanimously in
both Houses. This bill also contains cleanup language for last year?s funding law, P.A. 100-23.
This bill will soon be sent to the Governor for his consideration.

113 3342 (Gregory Harris) (Steans) This is the Budget Implementation Act (BIMP). It contains
the following interesting provisions regarding certain State funds only. Below is a Widely
reported summary of those provisions. Please note that any pension fund(s) savings reported here
were calculated by the pension Funds? Actuaries.




Tier 1 Pension Buy-Out for Vested, Inactive Members

 

Offers a pension buy-out in an amount estimated at 60% net present value of assets to all Tier 1
members who have a vested pension but are no longer active members of SERS, SURS, and
TRS. Estimated savings is $41 million. A maximum of $1 billion in bonds will be issued over
the course of three (3) years to pay for this proposal and the following 3% COLA buy-out.

3% COLA Buyout

 

This provides retiring Tier 1 members an option to have their automatic annual increases
calculated at 1.5% in exchange for an accelerated pension bene?t payment equal to 70% of the
difference between the actuarial present value of the automatic annual increase under the Tier 1
provisions and the actuarial present value of an automatic annual increase of 

The estimated savings for this buy-out is $381.9 million. Further, a maximum of $1 billion in
bonds will be issued over the course of three (3) years to pay for this proposal and the buy-out
for vested, inactive members.

Reduce Spiking Cap to 3% from 6%

 

This part of the pension changes in the BIMP bill reduces the salary spiking cap from 6% to 3%
starting in FY 19. Please note: Any additional pension costs due to a salary increase over 3%
would be covered by the local employer. The estimated savings for the reduced spiking cap
would be in the amount of $22 million.

Recertifieation

This requires a re-certi?cation of the State contribution for FY19 to re?ect the changes to SERS,
SURS, and TRS no earlier than June 15, 2019, and no later than June 30, 2019. 
vouchers will not be paid for the 11th and 12th month of the ?scal year 2019 until the
recerti?cation is submitted to the Governor, the Comptroller, and the General Assembly.

Senate Amendment 1 to SB 371, which is currently on hold in the Senate Committee on
Assignments, would allow for downstate police and ?re pension boards to opt-in to either a
Downstate Police Pension Investment Fund or a Downstate Fire Pension Investment Fund. These
new funds would assume the investment authority only of the local boards. A local pension
board would have the voluntary option to transfer their investment authority to their respective
downstate investment fund.
