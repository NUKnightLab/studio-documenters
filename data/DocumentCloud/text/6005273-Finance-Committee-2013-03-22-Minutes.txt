III. Action Items
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)
The following individuals presented additional information on the requests: Dr. Ram Raju, Chief Executive
Officer; Dr. Terry Mason, Chief Operating Officer of the Cook County Department of Public Health; Paulette
Brooks, Deputy Director of the Cook County Office of Contract Compliance; and John Cookinham, System
Chief Financial Officer.
Chairman O’Donnell inquired regarding whether any grants received by the System in general are in jeopardy
of funding due to the State’s budget constraints. Board Chairman Carvalho indicated that it is his
understanding that the budget introduced by the Governor for the Illinois Department of Public Health does not
include reductions of any of the grants in question here. Generally speaking with regard to grants, at least as it
was introduced, the budget is intact. The House and the Senate are holding hearings on those budgets over the
coming weeks; the Legislature will deal with it by the end of May.
With regard to request number 4, Board Chairman Carvalho inquired whether the fees charged to the
municipalities cover the cost of services provided by the Cook County Department of Public Health (CCDPH)
for inspections of food service establishments and retail food stores. He noted that the municipalities in
question have the obligation to do the inspections, and the Statute allows them to discharge that obligation by
contracting with a health department. Therefore, they are discharging their obligation by contracting with
CCDPH. If the System is assisting the municipalities in satisfying their statutory requirements by performing
these services for them, then the cost of performing those services ought to be covered by the fees. Director
Michael inquired as to the process to go back and raise the fees for this service, if needed.
Dr. Mason
responded that the fees are set forth within the terms of the Intergovernmental Agreement, and approximately
cover the cost of two inspectors to perform these services. He added that he can provide further financial
information on the matter. Board Chairman Carvalho requested that this information be provided prior to the
Board Meeting on March 28th1; additionally, he requested that similar requests presented in the future include
this information.
Chairman O’Donnell inquired regarding the requests presented for the Committee’s consideration that are
currently pending review by Contract Compliance. Ms. Besenhofer indicated that there were several at this
time that are currently pending review. In response to a question regarding possible reasons for delays for this,
Ms. Besenhofer indicated sometimes the delay is due in part to the vendor’s cooperation; some vendors find
the County’s requirements difficult to deal with at times. For example, one reason that may be causing delays
is due to the County’s requirement regarding child support; big corporations have challenges in filling out that
paperwork, because they do not want to go to their Board of Directors and ask each of them if they have child
support commitments that they need to be fulfilling.
With regard to the County’s requirements regarding child support, Board Chairman Carvalho inquired whether
there is a new requirement involved. Ms. Besenhofer responded in the negative; she stated that with the
change in administration, they are continuing to hold vendors accountable, but accountable in a different way
than has been done in the past. There is an affidavit, as has been required in the past, but there has been more
pushback from the corporations who do not want to sign it. Board Chairman Carvalho clarified by asking the
following question: are we asking the regional manager from IBM to certify that there is no employee of IBM
who is delinquent on their child support? Ms. Besenhofer responded affirmatively.

III. Action Items
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)
Ms. Besenhofer explained that staff from the System’s Supply Chain Management works with the following
three areas within the County regarding procurements: Office of Contract Compliance, Child Support and
Ethics. Ms. Brooks provided additional information on the forms used by the Office of Contract Compliance
as part of the review process. She stated that there are a number of forms that are required to be completed by
the vendor. Contract Compliance only asks for three of those documents – Utilization Plan, Letter of Intent
and Request for a Waiver.
Ms. Besenhofer noted that she will be meeting next week with Jacqueline Gomez, Director of the Cook County
Office of Contract Compliance, to discuss the subject and try to streamline the process. She can provide an
update on the subject at the next Committee Meeting.
With regard to request number 6, Ms. Besenhofer noted that the vendor was found to be non-compliant at this
point in time by the Office of Contract Compliance, based on their March 2013 Utilization Report that was
submitted. Board Chairman Carvalho recollected that, based on court cases regarding minority and womenowned business enterprise contracting, he believed it was determined that the County can establish goals, but
cannot establish hard and fast requirements. Ms. Brooks responded that the Ordinance specifies that the
County is requesting that its vendors meet goals; vendors are asked to demonstrate their best efforts to meet
those goals. When a company commits to those goals, they are held accountable; when they do not meet those
goals, then there are ways to encourage them to meet goals by offering strategies or other options to meet those
goals.
Board Chairman Carvalho stated that, if the goal is not met, the consequence is that the System cannot contract
with them – that does not sound like a goal, it sounds like a requirement. Ms. Brooks responded that it is a
goal. The vendor has made a commitment; once they resolve themselves and make that commitment, then
Contract Compliance holds them accountable to that commitment. For the duration of this contract term, the
vendor is required to communicate with Contract Compliance if the goal is difficult or unable to meet – if this
occurs, Contract Compliance can take a look at the situation and provide them with other alternatives and
strategies, or release them from that goal; however, if the vendor is not communicating and giving Contract
Compliance an opportunity of coming up with a strategy for them, then they are in non-compliance. Chairman
O’Donnell inquired regarding how often Contract Compliance communicates with the vendors so that
everyone knows in a timely fashion that they are not going to be able to meet their goal, thereby allowing for
the opportunity to develop an alternative strategy for how to meet the goal. Ms. Brooks responded that there is
a monthly monitoring report prepared. Every month, or every couple of months, Contract Compliance reviews
the report; if there are vendors who have not met their goals, Contract Compliance then contacts the vendor to
let them know that they have not met the goal. Following this, Contract Compliance then offers opportunities
to come up with strategies, and helps the vendor to determine how to meet that goal.
In relation to request numbers 6 and 7, Director Michael inquired regarding efforts to address vacancy issues in
key departments. One of the things that has been discussed is the fact that the System has a lot of people to
hire across various departments; it is preferable to see the System hiring permanent employees, if possible, and
as soon as possible, so that these contract amounts can be reduced. Dr. Raju responded that efforts are being
made to hire and fill the vacant positions as soon as possible. On top of this, there is also the added burden of
running medical homes, so more people need to be hired for that function. The Human Resources department
is actively working on staffing and trying to figure out how to get this done in a timely fashion. Additionally,
as the new systems are put in place, there is a learning curve that slows down the productivity of the
employees. His intention is to bring the work inside; he does not want temporary workers. He added that
regular reports are provided to the Human Resources Committee regarding the number of people hired and the
pace of hiring.

III. Action Items
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)
With regard to request number 11, Mr. Oder inquired regarding the deferred payment terms, as referenced in
the transmittal. He inquired how this will impact the future payments; additionally, he asked whether the
System would plan to record an operating expense for the utilization of this equipment over that time, even
though cash payment is deferred until 2014. Mr. Cookinham responded that when the Finance staff receives
the details on that item, they will make an accrual for the period of time of leasing the equipment; at the end of
the fiscal year, there will be a liability for that amount.
With regard to request number 16, the Committee briefly discussed the subject of academic affiliations.
Director Michael indicated that a report on the subject was made at the March 13th Quality and Patient Safety
Committee Meeting; the report will be included as part of the minutes of the Quality and Patient Safety
Committee Meeting presented for approval at the March 28th Board Meeting. Dr. Raju added that an analysis
that further addresses the subject was requested at that meeting.
As noted earlier in the meeting, there were several requests that were awaiting completion of review by the
County’s Office of Contract Compliance; it is hoped that review will be completed prior to the Board Meeting
on March 28th. Board Chairman Carvalho indicated that, if there are any essential requests that remain
outstanding, the Board has the option of approving the request conditionally on the 28th, subject to completion
of review by Contract Compliance.
As a quorum of Committee Members was present in the room at this time, Board
Chairman Carvalho was not participating in the meeting during the consideration of
this item as a temporary voting member of the Committee.
Director Michael, seconded by Director Ramirez, moved the approval of request
numbers 1 through 16, pending completion of review of the proposed requests by
Contract Compliance. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
Note: at the March 28th Board Meeting, request numbers 6 and 12 remained
pending, with regard to completion of review by Contract Compliance; those
requests received conditional approval from the Board, pending completion of
the review by Contract Compliance.

C. Supplemental Contracts and Procurement Items
There were no Supplemental Contracts and Procurement items presented for the Committee’s consideration.

D. Proposed Resolutions: (Attachment #3)
i. Authorizing the closure of the Third Party Reimbursement bank account for John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital
of Cook County at JP Morgan Chase Bank
ii. Authorizing the closure of the Special Revenue and Imprest bank accounts for Oak Forest Health Center
at MB Financial
iii. Authorizing the closure of the Medicare Revenue bank account for Oak Forest Health Center at
Suburban Bank and Trust
Director Ramirez, seconded by Director Michael, moved the approval of the three (3)
proposed Resolutions. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

III. Action Items (continued)
E. Request for authorization to enter into and execute Lease Schedules, pursuant to the Replacement
Master Lease Agreement with Banc of America Leasing and Capital Corp., for the leasing of the items
set forth in the memorandum dated March 14, 2013 (Attachment #4)
Ms. Besenhofer presented the request for the Committee’s consideration. The Committee reviewed and
discussed the request.
Mr. Oder noted that, for future requests, it would be beneficial to have information provided on the schedule
regarding the cost of the equipment. It is a variable rate, so the payment from the System may change from
month to month. He inquired as to what options the System will have available at the end of the lease. Mr.
Cookinham responded that these are fair market value leases. At the end of the term, the lease can be
extended, the System can buy the equipment, or the equipment can be returned. Right now, in the hospital
industry, a lot of the radiology equipment is leased because of the obsolescence factor – it would be returned at
the end of the term and a more modern version would be leased or the existing equipment would be updated.

As a quorum of Committee Members was not present in the room at this time, Board
Chairman Carvalho was participating in the meeting during the consideration of this
item as a temporary voting member of the Committee.
Director Michael, seconded by Board Chairman Carvalho, moved the approval of the
request for authorization to enter into and execute the Lease Schedules. THE
MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

F. Any items listed under Sections III and IV

IV. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
A. Financial Reports – February 2013 (Attachment #5)
Dorothy Loving, System Executive Director of Finance, presented the Financial Reports for the period through
February 2013. The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
Mr. Oder inquired regarding the County Care revenue and expense information. Mr. Cookinham responded
that a draft statement with that information will be provided later in the meeting, during the update on the
Waiver. Mr. Oder inquired whether Waiver financial information should be included somewhere in the
financial reports. Mr. Cookinham responded that he can include this in the financial reports for the next
period.
Director Michael provided an update on a matter discussed at the previous Committee Meeting. It had been
determined that some members of the Committee would work with management to address the requests for
information and to provide their expertise in order to develop a high-level operating indicators report for the
Committee and Board’s use. He informed the Committee that he and Mr. Oder are working with management
on the report, and will continue to provide updates on the matter as these activities continue.

IV. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items (continued)
B. Update on Section 1115 Medicaid Waiver Demonstration Project / CountyCare (Attachment #6)
Susan Greene, System Interim Director of Managed Care, provided an update on the Section 1115 Medicaid
Waiver Demonstration Project/CountyCare. Additionally, Aaron Galeener, System Budget Director, presented
information relating to the Waiver revenues and expenses.
Ms. Greene stated that as of Wednesday, March 20th, 32,000 applications have been initiated. Of those, 477
are older than 75 days and need to be written off. With regard to the applications that will need to be written
off, Chairman O’Donnell inquired whether actions are being taken to minimize this. Ms. Green responded that
that is the goal; at this point, the applications that are 75 days old date back to the early periods of enrollment.
She stated that this is actually a pretty good ratio; she noted that she expects it to rise because there has been a
tremendous response from non-County patients to apply by phone.
For this month to date, there is an average of 458 applications per day. Approximately 300 applications are
sent to the State per day; last week it went up to 387 per day. The State’s Department of Human Services
(DHS) is processing between 150-175 applications per day, so there is a lag time. There have been issues with
DHS appropriately staffing-up and regarding their long training period, so some overtime has been authorized
to catch up with the backlog.
Ms. Greene stated that, beginning April 1st, there will be a two-month pilot project at Cermak Health Services,
to enroll detainees upon their release from the Cook County Department of Corrections, and to track to see
whether this may affect recidivism, particularly by opening or increasing access for those individuals to
services related to addiction treatment and behavioral health.
Director Michael inquired further regarding the applications that are denied or not approved. Ms. Greene
responded that the most common reason for denial is because the applicant’s income is higher than reported. If
this is not the reason for denial, CountyCare staff tries to keep working to get the applicant approved for
enrollment.
Chairman O’Donnell posed the following questions: once a patient is connected to a medical home, how is the
System managing the care? Are the patients able to schedule appointments easily? Ms. Greene responded that
this is evolving - when the patient selects a medical home, they are given the information and phone number of
the location for scheduling appointments. The following plan is not yet implemented, but when the application
is submitted, staff will be doing outreach to those high-risk applicants at that point, and then will make a
thorough determination of what their needs are, and make an appointment.
Ms. Greene noted that there is one contract that has not been executed regarding the medical homes, due to
some conversations that are ongoing with the State; otherwise the rest of the contracts related to the Waiver
have been executed, and the vendors are just submitting invoices now.
Chairman O’Donnell noted that Dr. Raju recently mentioned that the County was applying for a Managed Care
Community Network (MCCN) at the State level; she asked if he could provide an update on the subject. Dr.
Raju responded that there are a couple of things that are needed to be done. CountyCare is a demonstration
project - if the administration does nothing, it will expire December 31st. If CountyCare is to exist beyond
December 31st, it needs to be given some kind of identity. There are two ways to do this: 1) do it with an
MCCN; or 2) go with a full-fledged managed care plan. The MCCN will allow the System to keep the
Medicaid patients within the System. The future goal is not only regarding Medicaid patients, but to place the
System’s plan in the Health Exchange and to offer the plan to employees.

IV. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
B. Update on Section 1115 Medicaid Waiver Demonstration Project / CountyCare (continued)
The System has to go through the process of first getting the MCCN, because the last date for putting the
managed care plan into the Exchange is around the end of April; the exchange starts October 1st. There is not
enough time to do that, so what may happen is moving to a MCCN for the managed care and all of the
System’s Medicaid patients; this would be followed by setting up a managed care plan. He noted that he had
his first meeting on the subject with representatives from the Department of Insurance at the State; he will
continue to update the Committee on the matter.

V.

Report from System Director of Supply Chain Management (Attachment #7)
A. Report of emergency purchases
B. Report of procurement and non-procurement matters for
FY2013 – 1st Quarter
There were no emergency purchases to report at this time. Ms. Besenhofer presented the report of procurement
matters for FY2013 – 1st Quarter, for the Committee’s information.

VI. Report from Chief Financial Officer (Attachment #8)
Mr. Cookinham provided an overview of a presentation that he will be presenting at an upcoming Healthcare
Financial Management Association conference. The presentation included information on the following subjects:
Cook County Health and Hospitals System (CCHHS) Mission; CCHHS characteristics; Inpatient and Outpatient
Payer Mix; CCHHS Income Statement; Uncompensated Care; and Transformation. The Committee reviewed and
discussed the information.
During the discussion of the information contained on page five of the presentation, it was suggested that a
footnote be included regarding admissions, that explains the decrease relating to the transition of Oak Forest
Hospital from an inpatient facility to Oak Forest Health Center, and relating to the suspension of some services at
Oak Forest Hospital.
Dr. Raju referenced the amount of uncompensated care provided by the System for the past three years, as reflected
on page seven of the presentation; in 2012 alone, the System provided over ½ billion dollars in uncompensated
care – this amounts to over half of the System’s annual budget. Director Ramirez recommended that a yearly
report on uncompensated care that is provided in the region be prepared by the System and be widely distributed;
additionally, the information should be embedded into the Report from the System Chief Executive Officer that is
provided annually to the Board of Commissioners of Cook County. Dr. Raju agreed with that recommendation.

VII. Adjourn
As the agenda was exhausted, Chairman O’Donnell declared the meeting ADJOURNED.

Cook County Health and Hospital system
1900 W. Polk Suite 220

Chicago, IL 60612

Dear Dr. Ramanathan Raj u,

SEIU Local 73 and Doctor?s Council SEIU is eager to participate in CountyCare outreach efforts to ensure the
program?s success. As you may well know, SEIU has extensive experience in mobilizing large numbers of
people in short periods of time. We'haVe a long history of mobilizing our membership to participate in electoral
organizing, unionization drives, contract campaigns and legislative advocacy. With our strength as a mass
membership organization, we believe we can be a true partner of the Cook County Health and Hospital System
as it implements efforts to enroll thousands of uninsured and underinsured individuals into CountyCare. Not
only will CountyCare, as designed, strengthen the ?nancial state of the health system, but the new program
gives thousands of people access to health care and health insurance, a cause endorsed by our local and
international leadership bodies.

We have enclosed an attached proposal to leverage our strength and knowledge in outreach and
education efforts for the sake of CountyCare enrollment. We hope both you and the County Health and
Hospital System Board considers this proposal, requesting a budget of 125,000 to assist in facilitating between
6,000 and 10,000 individuals initiating applications for County Care by November 1, 2013 at a minimum. We
plan on doing so at a conservatively estimated cost of $10 to $20 dollars per referral, well below the $50 per-
referral historically given to outreach workers enrolling individuals into the All Kids CHIP program. We are
willing to work with and coordinate our efforts with outreach, education and enrollment contractors,
including Prairie Group Consulting, Automated Health Systems, the Purple Group, PCI Communications and
Jayne Agency. We therefore request that the board strongly consider this request to let us assist the
County in generating much needed revenue.

Sincerely, .

Subject: Lease Schedules under replacement Master Lease Agreement with Banc of America
Leasing Corp and Capital Corp., LLC

In August 2010, pursuant to the authorization by this Board, the entered into a replacement
Master Lease Agreement with Banc of America Leasing and Capital Corp., LLC (?Banc of America?) for the
purposes of leasing capital equipment beginning in 2010. Under the Master Lease the parties may enter
into Lease Schedules with respect to specific items of equipment to be leased.

Under the Master Lease, the interest rate for each Lease Schedule is based upon the three-year United
States Treasury Maturity SWAP rate. The amounts payable under each lease schedule may therefore vary
depending upon changes in this indicator.

We are requesting your authorization to enter into and execute additional lease schedules and related
agreements, as required, to permit to lease the equipment listed on the FY 2013 List of Proposed
Banc of America Equipment (Covered Equipment Attachment) attached to this memorandum.

The estimated maximum acquisition cost for the items on the Covered Equipment Attachment is
$1,253,132.05. This equipment will be leased pursuant to one or more lease schedules under the
replacement Master Lease Agreement. The lease schedules shall have terms of 60 months and
interest shall be based on the then?current SWAP rate. In the event Banc of America is required
to make certain interim payments to the manufacturer at the time of the purchase and equipment
delivery, a related agreement will be entered into with Banc of America, in addition to the
applicable Lease Schedule, or will be included in the amounts due under the applicable lease
schedule at the rate of PRIME minus 

Under the lease schedules, control and use of the equipment will rest entirely with the Health System.
The equipment is being acquired by Banc of America based on the Health stem?s specifications and

acquisition pricing secured by the Health System. APPROVED

 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
INTRODUCTION
This discussion and analysis provides the readers of the monthly unaudited financial
statements of the Cook County Health and Hospital System (CCHHS) with an overview
of the financial activities for the month ended February 28, 2013. This discussion
focuses on the significant financial issues and major financial activities during the current
month. It should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements of
the CCHHS.
The CCHHS includes the following entities: John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital (JSH), Oak
Forest Health Center (OFC) Provident Hospital (PHCC), the Department of Public Health
(DPH), the Ambulatory and Community Health Network (ACHN), the Bureau of Health
Services (BHS), CORE Center (for reporting purposes part of Stroger Hospital), and
Cermak Health Services (CHS). Starting this fiscal year 2013, we have added the 1115
Waiver. Collectively, these entities provide primary, intermediate, acute, and tertiary
medical care to patients, without regard to their ability to pay. The Bureau of Health
Services oversees the operational, planning, and policy activities of the CCHHS.
The CCHHS is included in the reporting entity of the Cook County, Illinois, as an
enterprise fund. As an enterprise fund, the CCHHS’ financial statements are prepared
using proprietary fund accounting that focuses on the determination of changes in net
assets, financial position, and cash flows in a manner similar to private sector businesses.
The financial statements are prepared on an accrual basis of accounting, which
recognizes revenue when earned and expenses when incurred.
In 2008 the Cook County Health and Hospital System Board was created by the Cook
County Board of Commissioners to provide independent oversight of health care
operations, and in 2010 the Cook County Board of Commissioners voted to make the
Cook County Health and Hospital System Board permanent.
In 2010 the Cook County Health and Hospital System Board and the Cook County Board
of Commissioners approved Vision 2015 Strategic Plan, which outlines, over five years,
restructuring CCHHS to deliver the best possible care for the vulnerable population of
Cook County within the constraints of dollar resources available to the health system.
This plan seeks to better allocate resources.
In 2012 the Cook County Health and Hospitals System and Cook County Board Officials
collaborated to cut Medicaid costs, help county taxpayers, and transform Cook County’s
hospital system by jump-starting national health care reform in Cook County. In October,
2012 the federal governmnent approved the 1115 Medicaid Waiver for Cook County,
allowing CCHHS to enroll more than 115,000 individuals who will be eligible for
Medicaid in 2014 into a Cook County network with no cost to the state of Illinois.
An 1115 Waiver allows the Cook County’s Health System to early enroll certain
uninsured patients into Medicaid. Specifically, these are patients who are not currently
5
Page 58 of 114

 eligible for Medicaid, but who will be eligible in 2014 under the Accountable Care Act.
Many of these individuals are patients who already are being treated by our system
without compensation. The Waiver is funded entirely by the federal government.

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS (IN THOUSANDS)
The Cook County Health and Hospitals System finished the three months with overall
revenue of $163,999 and overall expenses was $234,930.
Net Patient revenue for the three months was $95,109.
Net Patient revenue consists of all charges including automated contractual allowances
and bad debt adjustments. Write-off of Bad Debt is a CCHHS Board approved policy.
Other revenue was $1,074. Other revenue consists primarily of parking revenue.

Patient Accounts Receivable – BEPA System
General
As compared to November 30, 2012, Total Patient Accounts Receivable at the end of
February-2013 reduced by 19 to 103 days. Additionally, there was a 6 day decrease in
this figure, as compared to the previous month’s figure.
Days of Revenue Outstanding measures the average number of days charges remain in
accounts receivable after service has been rendered before collection activities have been
completed, including charity care and bad debt write-offs. Days of Revenue Outstanding
is measured in charges, not cash collections.
Days of Revenue Outstanding is a useful tool to measure collection efforts over time (i.e.,
whether this number is growing or decreasing). This number will be large due to the
large number of Self-Pay patients CCHHS services and the processes CCHHS must
complete before patient accounts are collected or written-off to bad debt. These
processes include, but are not limited to, the following:






Making an effort to attain third-party insurance coverage, including the 1115
waiver;
Processing charity care applications;
Sending three (3) monthly statements before accounts are turned over to
collections;
Placing accounts bi-monthly with the collection agency; and
Permitting patients to pay their account balances over time (time payment).

Total billed accounts fell by $10.157M (3.4%) as compared to the November-2012
balance. As compared to the previous month, this figure grew by $5.919M (2.1%), but
has declined in eleven (11) out of the last thirteen (13) months. The overall decline in
6
Page 59 of 114

 this figure indicates an increasing number of accounts are completing the collection
process, which includes charity care and bad debt write-offs.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts, as
Medicaid pays CCHHS claims on a per-diem and Medicare pays CCHHS on the
diagnosis, regardless of charges on the patient accounts. Additionally, charity care and
bad debt write-offs will not result in actual cash collections.
Inpatient Accounts Receivable – BEPA System Only
Discharged Not Final Billed
Inpatient discharged but not final billed accounts at the end of February-2013 increased
by $2.219M (25.1%) and by $1.422M (14.8%), as compared the November 30, 2012 and
the previous month’s balances, respectively. This indicates that fewer inpatient accounts
are moving to a “Billed” status, as compared to the previous month.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts, as
Medicaid pays CCHHS’ claims on a per-diem and Medicare pays CCHHS’ claims on the
diagnosis, regardless of charges on the patient accounts. Additionally, charity care and
bad debt write-offs are part of the collection process and will not result in actual cash
collections.
Billed Inpatient Accounts
Billed inpatient accounts at the end of February-2013 increased by $4.113M (2.6%) as
compared to the November 30, 2012 balance. This figure grew by $5.487M (3.5%)
compared to the previous month’s total.
The increase in this number indicates less accounts had the collection process completed
than in the previous month and that fewer accounts are being removed from active
accounts receivable. CCHHS’ collection process includes charity care and bad debt
write-offs.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts, as
Medicaid pays on a per-diem and Medicare pays on the diagnosis, regardless of charges
on the patient accounts. Additionally, charity care and bad debt write-offs will not result
in actual cash collections.
Outpatient Accounts Receivable – BEPA System
Unbilled Outpatient Accounts
The balance of unbilled outpatient accounts increased by $0.593M (3.4%) by the end of
February-2013, as compared to the level of unbilled accounts as of November 30, 2012.
This balance, as of the end of this month, was $1.505M (7.7%) smaller than the previous
month’s balance. This indicates that fewer outpatient accounts are moving to a “Billed”
status, as compared to the previous month.

7
Page 60 of 114

 The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts due
to Medicaid’s and Medicare’s reimbursement configuration.
Billed Outpatient Accounts
The billed outpatient accounts receivable at the end of February-2013 fell by $14.270M
(10.3%) over the balance as of November 30, 2012. This figure is $0.432M (0.3%)
greater than last month’s figure.
The growth in this figure indicates that fewer Out-Patient accounts had their collection
and write-off related activities completed, as compared to the prior month.
The reduction of internal bill-holds from 20 days to 6 days will tend to cause a growth in
the billed accounts receivable.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts due
to Medicaid and Medicare’s reimbursement configuration and to charity care and bad
debt write-offs.

Depreciation - $8.488M
Utilities - $1.221M
Insurance - $2.985M.

Page 61 of 114

 Nonoperating Revenue was $67.816M. The largest portions of this are attributed to sales
tax in the amount of $17.220M and property tax in the amount of $20.332M. Sales tax
revenues are recognized by CCHHS when earned; this occurs when the underlying sales
transactions occur. The amount recorded as Due from State of Illinois - Sales Tax
represents the amounts earned by CCHHS, however, the cash is not yet received from the
state. There is a 3 months lag from the time of the underlying sales transaction to the
receipt of funds.
Taxes collected for the Health to date have been fully credited to the Health Fund except
as mentioned in the previous paragraph.

OVERVIEW OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
This discussion and analysis are intended to serve as an introduction to the CCHHS
financial statements. CCHHS basic monthly unaudited financial statements are comprised
of fund financial statements.
A fund is a grouping of related accounts that is used to maintain control over resources
that have been segregated for specific activities or objectives. The CCHHS, like other
state and local governments, uses fund accounting to ensure and demonstrate compliance
with finance-related legal requirements.

The Medicaid fee-for-service revenue through the IGT covers the period beginning week ended 01/23/12 - 02/13/13 .
Vendor Payments From Revenue are payments out of revenue posted by the County Comptroller. Pharmacy Billing and Revenue Enhancement
payments are reductions to Medicaid revenue. Collection Agency payments are reductions to Self-Pay (Other) revenue. Physician Billing payments
include refunds processed by CCHHS. Included in the "Revenue Enhancement" totals are payments to the state for supplemental workers
hired to help clear the Medicaid backlog.
The Meaningful Use budget was spread over 12 months, as it was not known at the time the budget was created in which month this payment
will be received. Meaningful Use includes both the Medicare and Medicaid portions.

New Sources of Revenue
1115 Waiver – The System was granted a waiver for the early expansion of
Medicaid on November 1, 2012. The 1115 Waiver is a demonstration
project to show that a coordinated patient care model is less expensive than
the traditional fragmented episodic care of the past.

b.

The Waiver expands the number of patients in Cook County that are
eligible for Medicaid. It is estimated that almost 300,000 Cook County
residents

CCHHS will utilize a third party administrator for CountyCare to obtain
eligibility, pay claims, pre-authorize care, and communicate with the
members of CountyCare.
