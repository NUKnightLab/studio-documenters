APPROVAL OF COMMUNICATION NO. 254696, AS AMENDED. THE MOTION CARRIED.

SECTION 12
Your Committee has considered, for infonnational purposes, the Fiscal Year 2002 3rd Quarter report of
the County of Cook as submitted by the Bureau of Finance.
Chainnan Daley asked Thomas J. Glaser, Chief Financial Officer, to comment on the report.
Mr. Glaser advised that this report merely presents a snapshot of the County's fiscal condition at a
specific point in time, and should not be construed as a long tenn projection of either revenues or
expenditures. He stated that mid-year fluctuations are nonnal and expected, and he reiterated his belief
that the County will end its fiscal year at or near initial projections for both revenue and expenditures.
Commissioner Hansen asked ifthere has been a change with regard to projected fee revenue.
Mr. Glaser stated that yes, fee revenue from operations at the Recorder of Deeds Office is ahead of
projections by $44 million. This is largely due to low mortgage interest rates, which have encouraged
homeowners to refinance their mortgages in near-record numbers, which in tum increases both the
workload and fees received by the Recorder's Office. Mr. Glaser expects at least one more quarter of
favorable interest rates and a continued strong market for new home sales, but beyond that it is difficult to
predict.

R EQUEST). Transmitting a Communication from Deborah Sims, Chainnan, Finance Tax
Delinquency Subcommittee, submitting a request from Dr. Irene H. Brodie, Mayor, Village
of Robbins:
Re:

South Suburban Tax Reactivation-Village of Robbins

I am requesting your assistance on behalf of the residents of the Village of Robbins in
securing tax delinquent property on a no cash bid basis. The Village of Robbins has a history
of severe property tax delinquency, and most of our vacant parcels are seriously delinquent.
We would like to convert these vacant and delinquent parcels into revenue generating land.
The Village of Robbins is also on the verge of beginning some much needed sustai nable
commercial development. However the Village owns little land to provide to developers for
these projects. Acquiring these parcels will allow us to move forwa rd in the process of
securing development within the Village of Robbins.
