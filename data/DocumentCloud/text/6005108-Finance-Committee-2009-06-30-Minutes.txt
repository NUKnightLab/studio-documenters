Presentation of Year-to-Date Financials through April 2009
Dorothy Loving, Executive Director of Finance of the Cook County Health and Hospitals System,
presented the Year-to-Date Financials through March 2009 (Attachment #1).
During the discussion relating to revenue, it was reported that the total operating revenue is down from
what was budgeted. Director O’Donnell inquired as to the reason for this. Pitt Calkin, Interim Chief
Financial Officer of the Cook County Health and Hospitals System, responded that they are still
reviewing it. He referred to data contained in the reference materials that breaks out the payer source. He
pointed out that self pay has decreased to under 50%, but Medicare is down to 9%. Medicare is usually in
the 11-12% range; this is puzzling. It could be due to a decrease in volume. He added that this impacts
the graduate medical education program, which is reimbursed by Medicare. Acting Chairman Golden
requested that an update be provided on the drop in Medicare.
Director O’Donnell asked whether the financials are being filtered down to the departmental level. Mr.
Calkin stated that they were not; however, when the Lawson system is up and running, it will produce
these types of reports at a departmental level. He further explained that there are four modules that were
purchased for the Lawson system; one of the first modules going up is the general ledger system. With
that general ledger system, reports will be available at a department level that will drill-down and separate
out expenditures such as supplies and payroll, which are the two biggest expenses. He expects that it will
be up by January or February.
The Committee discussed operating expenses. Ms. Loving highlighted the area of utilities, and indicated
that they have come up with a better methodology of determining the utilities comparing the budget to the
actual amount. In 2008, they were using the general ledger figures – this poses a problem because it only
accounts for the bills that have hit the system, not for bills that are outstanding that have not hit the
system. However, in 2009, they are going by the bills, rather than the general ledger figures, which
provides a more accurate figure.
With regard to payer mix comparison, Acting Chairman Golden asked for last year’s percentages. Ms.
Loving responded that last year, self-pay was at 55% and Medicare was at 12%. Director O’Donnell
requested that a comparison be provided the next time that financials are presented.
Director O’Donnell asked whether the System is improving on the issue of coding and case mix. Mr.
Calkin responded that they are making some progress. He stated that it is a three-prong approach that
needs to be taken. First, the coding is important. He referenced the work MedAssets has done to improve
the coding, and added that an individual has been brought in through MedAssets to head-up the medical
information systems, which will make a big difference. Secondly, a clinical documentation system needs
to be put in place, which consists of having someone come in and run the physicians and the extenders
through this program. He should be coming back to the Finance Committee with a contract for it,
hopefully in August. The third part is case management. A case manager follows a patient and works
with the physicians; they can prompt the physician on some of the clinical documentation issues.
With regard to the information provided on eligibility vendor performance comparisons, Director
O’Donnell noted that it didn’t seem to be an “apples to apples” comparison. Mr. Calkin agreed, stating
that they would pull the report; they are currently working on a more meaningful report on that subject.

It was stated that an amendment was necessary for request number 29, to correct the contract extension
period.
The Committee reviewed and discussed the requests presented for their consideration.
With regard to the request for payment to TRE Reimbursement Consulting for the review and preparation
of the 2008 Medicare, Illinois Medicaid, and Blue Cross cost reports for Provident Hospital, Director
O’Donnell inquired whether the System has the same people going forward with the cost report. Mr.
Calkin responded that when the Finance Division was reorganized, they included the provision of a
System reimbursement director. As a result, all of the cost reports will be done at the System level; they
will not be using outside contractors for such services.
With regard to the request to extend the contract with Intercommunity Radiation Oncology for radiation
therapy services for Oak Forest Hospital, Director Greenspan asked for information on the volume of
treatments, whether the volume has changed, and whether it is a flat rate regardless of volume. Sylvia
Edwards, Chief Operating Officer of Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County, responded that the rate will
stay the same. She added that she would provide the information on the volumes.
With regard to the request to increase and extend the contract, as amended, with Carolyn Arnolds, for the
provision of consulting services in preparation for the annual Joint Commission site visit for Stroger
Hospital, Director O’Donnell inquired whether it was typical to hire a consultant for these services. Dr.
Maurice Lemon, Chief Medical Officer at John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County, responded that
they do not have an in-house staff member for such services. Acting Chairman Golden stated that it is her
experience that these types of consulting services are common; they are used at the University of Chicago
Medical Center. Mr. Foley added that it is common, even if there is in-house staff, to bring in an expert
for this type of specialty work.

 REPORT OF THE FINANCE COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE
COOK COUNTY HEALTH AND HOSPITALS SYSTEM
JUNE 30, 2009
PAGE 15

The Committee discussed an item relating to the IRIS system. Director O’Donnell requested information
on the mechanics of determining who participates in the IRIS system. Acting Chairman Golden requested
that a presentation be made on the subject by the Ambulatory and Community Health Network of Cook
County, at a future meeting.
Michael Bernard, Interim Chief Financial Officer at John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County,
provided information on the request to enter into and execute the contract with Healthy Advice
Communications, for patient handbooks.
With regard to the request relating to System Solutions, Inc., for software, information technology
networking and performance monitoring tools, Director Ramirez asked whether this would be compatible
with the Enterprise system. Mr. Calkin responded that he would provide the answer after speaking with
Steven Zeelau, Chief Information Officer for the System.
Director Greenspan asked for the unit cost of the pregnancy test kits under request number 40. Leslie
Duffy, Director of Procurement for the Cook County Health and Hospitals System, stated that she would
find out the answer. Director Greenspan requested that unit costs be provided for these type of requests in
the future.
Acting Chairman Golden, seconded by Director O’Donnell, moved the approval of the Contracts
and Procurement Approval Items, as amended. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
________________________________

Update on Contracting Issues
Ms. Duffy provided an update on contracting issues. She stated that there will be a full presentation at the
next Board meeting on group purchasing organization (GPO) efforts, and on the subject of moving
purchasing in-house by August 1st.
Ms. Duffy stated that they are on target and moving forward with the contract with Owens & Minor as a
primary medical/surgical distributor, as well as UHC/Novation. With regard to the contract with U.S.
Foods, she stated that they are in the negotiation stages. She has been working with the State’s
Attorney’s Office as far as payment terms.
________________________________

Discussion of Nurse Registry Usage
Martina Harrison, RN, MSN, Chief Nursing Officer of Provident Hospital of Cook County, presented a
report on nurse registry usage (Attachment #3).
Director O’Donnell inquired why Provident Hospital’s registry usage is almost as high as Stroger
Hospital’s usage. Ms. Harrison responded that at Provident Hospital, they first start with overtime, then
registry. Because they have a smaller pool from which to pull for overtime at Provident Hospital, and
because often they need specialized nurses, it makes it more likely that registry nurses will be used.

 REPORT OF THE FINANCE COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE
COOK COUNTY HEALTH AND HOSPITALS SYSTEM
JUNE 30, 2009
PAGE 16

Director O’Donnell asked which is less expensive – utilizing overtime or registry usage? Ms. Harrison
responded that registry usage costs more.
The Committee discussed vacancy rates and human relations issues relating to the subject. Ms. Harrison
stated that she believes the System needs nurse recruiters that actively understand what is necessary to
provide care, so they can go out and recruit. They had a nurse recruiter in the past, and their efforts were
successful, however the individual was laid off in 2007.
________________________________

Update on GME and Medicare Bad Debt project
Ross Biank, from Public Consulting Group, provided an update on the graduate medical education
(GME) and Medicare Bad Debt project (Attachment #4). He added that there will be a final presentation
to the Board on September 30th.
During the presentation, it was stated that there was an issue that they were working on in which more
than one institution was claiming the same resident for the same period of time. Director O’Donnell
asked how this will be resolved. Mr. Biank stated that they are going through all of the affiliation
agreements to review the data, and should be able to resolve that question after the review.
Director Greenspan stated that claiming happens on a monthly basis. He asked what happens if there is a
resident that works only a partial month. Mr. Ross stated that that question is also under review, and will
be addressed in the final presentation to the Board.
The Committee discussed the plan for Medicare Bad Debt. Mr. Calkin stated that Medicare has a strict
policy on the procedures necessary to claim Medicare Bad Debt. In some of the institutions, in some
instances, these procedures were not carried out. In order to claim Medicare Bad Debt for these years,
they will need to go back and re-issue some of these bills. He stressed that it is imperative that the
System Board and County Commissioners are informed of this issue, and are informed of what will be
necessary to be able to claim the Medicare Bad Debt.
Director O’Donnell requested clarification on the steps that would be necessary. She asked if they could
possibly go back as far as 2005 and bill for services rendered, if no bill had been previously sent. Mr.
Calkin responded affirmatively. It would have to go through a billing process, followed by a collection
process, in order to be able to claim the Medicare Bad Debt. He stated that this is a discussion that needs
to be held with the full System Board, to ensure that this is the direction they want to go, however, he
added that it could mean millions of dollars.
It was stated that the final report on September 30th will have the analysis and figures relating to the
opportunities that could be taken with regard to claiming the Medicare Bad Debt.

Follow-up on outstanding requests for information
Mr. Calkin stated that a report is expected to be given at the next Finance Committee meeting regarding
Nighthawk, a company with whom the System contracts temporary radiology services. He explained that
the report will be presented in response to a previous request for information made by Director
Greenspan, relating to why the System needs to contract out for these services.
Director O’Donnell noted that another outstanding request is that relating to the vendor analysis.
________________________________
Update on 2009 Budget – Adoption and Implementation

Mr. Calkin provided the Committee with an update on the subject of the County Board resolution
currently being drafted, which, if approved, will address the System’s current inability to intra-fund
transfers from the 100-Account Series (Salaries and Wages), by allowing for the ability to make intrafund transfers within all of the System’s accounts. It is expected that the resolution will be presented to
the County Board at their meeting on July 21, 2009 for their consideration and approval.
Mr. Calkin briefly informed the Committee that on July 15th, there will be a meeting of the senior teams
of the facilities and System administration to kick-off the FY2010 budget.

Review and discuss the Report of the Finance Committee

the report. Hearing none, she proceeded to the next item on the agenda.

Approve Amendment to MedAssets contract for Revenue Cycle
(Attachment #5)
David Small, Chief Operating Officer of the Cook County Health and Hospitals System, presented
information (Attachment #6) on the proposed Amendment to the MedAssets contract, and provided an
overview. It was negotiated to convert the contract from a contingency rate fee-based formula to one that
is a fixed monthly fee. Also, in recognition of the fact that this discussion was initially generated because
of rate changes by Medicaid, there is an adjustment to the monthly baseline of collected revenue from
which part of MedAssets’ performance is judged. It has been lowered to reflect the fact that
approximately a 50% rate reduction has been sustained by the System in its Medicaid rates. Also
included is a performance incentive bonus. At the conclusion of this contract, if the designated threshold
has been reached or exceeded, there will be an additional one-time payment of $2,500,000 made to
MedAssets.

 REPORT OF THE FINANCE COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE
COOK COUNTY HEALTH AND HOSPITALS SYSTEM
JUNE 30, 2009
PAGE 18

The net result of the amendment is that there is a reduction in the projected fees with this change, there is
an increase to the incentive, and it continues to allow the System to adjust both the incentive threshold
and the monthly baseline figures if there are any continued changes in Medicaid rates during the life of
the contract. Also included in the amendment is a re-statement of language around documentation
calculation and annual audits regarding baseline revenues, benefits, and fees paid. It does not change any
of the original scope of service, project work plans, or organizational structure for which they were
contracted.
Director O’Donnell inquired whether this amendment addresses the question of which vendor generated
which revenue, and whether it provides for benchmarks for what is expected under the contract. Mr.
Small responded that MedAssets will no longer be paid beyond the fixed monthly rate for the scope of
services described in the contract (and the possible performance incentive at the end of the contract).
With regard to benchmarks, he stated that there are activities that they are responsible for carrying out,
and some of those translate to metrics.
Director O’Donnell stated that she would like to see monthly revenue expectations and expense data, by
different payors and different facilities and departments. Mr. Small indicated that that information will
eventually be coming in two different ways: 1) through the ERP system, there are elements that will
allow them to drill-down income and expense at the departmental level; and 2) as the transition is
completed to a fully and robustly-used charge master list, and the System converts to procedures-based
billing and charging, that level of detail will be available.
Acting Chairman Golden added that along with that snapshot, she would like to see the staffing that
MedAssets has in place.
Acting Chairman Golden, seconded by O’Donnell, seconded by Director Golden, moved the
approval of the Amendment to the MedAssets contract for Revenue Cycle. THE MOTION
CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

 Summary
The Cook County Health and Hospitals System year to date financial
results finished the Fifth month of the fiscal year behind the budget by
$4,661,363. The overall revenue shortfall at the end of the Fifth month
was $14,590,355. Expenses were below budget by $9,928,993 or 2.3%
Note: The budgeted revenue and expenditure amounts used on this
financial statement are pending final publication of the FY 2009 Budget.

Operating Revenue
Fees at the end of April collected from patient services were below
budget year to date by $2,597,696 or 1.4%. The number of Medicare
visits is down this year compared to the same period last year.
Other Revenue at the end of April is below the budget by $615,117 or
20.8%. We accrued the Department of Health revenue.
FMAP and NetDSH are recognized on a accrual basis to Budget.
Total Operating Revenue at the end of the April was below budget year to
date by $3,212,812 or 1.6%.

Operating Expenses
Operating Expenses at the end of April were below budget by $9,928,993
or 2.3%. This favorable expense performance was due to positive
variances for Supplies, Purchased Services, and Utilities. Salaries and
Employee Benefits were under the budget year to date.
Salaries and Wages – $19,720,592 or 8.4%
Salaries and wages were below the budget at the end of April due to the
FY 2009 Budget not being approved until mid-February which resulted in
none of the new budgeted positions being recruited for.
This information is an integral part of the accompanying consolidated financial statements

 Benefits - $2,794,408 or 8.4%
The level of Benefit expense is directly related to salary and wage
expense. Benefits for employees are below the budget because salaries
and wages are also below the budget.

Supplies – $2,500,000 or 3.7%
Each of the System facilities supply expenses are below the budget year
to date. The System is using the accrual convention to estimate supply
expense based on the budgeted expenditures minus any documented
savings to date.
In comparison to the prior year, the estimated YTD April 30, 2008 supply
expense of $20,181,374 ($28,572,596 as of YTD April’09) was based on
actual expense taken from the Comptroller’s AA ledger of actual items
paid by the County. During the preparation of the prior year’s report,
there were no attempts to estimate an accrual for any missing expenses.

Purchased Services, Rental, and Other - $2,100,000 or 3.1%
The year to date level expenses for the System for this category continues
to be significantly below the budget. The method used to estimate
expense is the same for purchased services as is used for supplies.
Similar to supplies, the prior YTD April 30, 2008 estimated purchase
services, rental, and other expense amount of $24,117,613 ($17,821,966
as of YTD April’09) was based on expenses taken from the Comptroller’s
AA ledgers.

This information is an integral part of the accompanying consolidated financial statements

 Utilities - $1,230,509 or 13.8%
The estimated System year to date expense for utilities in total is below
budget. The accrual convention to estimate this expense is based on total
YTD bills, paid and unpaid, received by the Cook County Industrial
Engineer responsible for processing the utility bills for the County.
Similar to supplies, the prior YTD April 30, 2008 estimated utilities
expense of $4,196,584 ($4,264,967 as of YTD April ’09) was also taken
from the Comptroller’s AA ledgers.

budget is as follows:

areas throughout the Emergency Room. The relocation of the
pneumatic tube system in the newly renovated Emergency Room
area was necessary so that Emergency Room patients' specimens

Medicare Bad Debt Review:
Critical Issues
•   Is there an opportunity available for Medicare bad debt reimbursement?
•   Do bad debt policies and procedures from Fiscal Years 2005 - 2008 meet 

Medicare criteria for seeking Medicare bad debt reimbursement? 

•   Are there actions BHHS must take to bring collection efforts in compliance with
Medicare expectations?
•   For example, issue collection letters for dates of service in 2007

•   Is there precedent for retroactively sending out three letters?
•   Is there a desire to pursue issuance of three letters?
•   Public outreach will be necessary for retroactive issuance of collection letters for
dates of service from two years ago (May 2007 - September 2007)
•   Already moved to retroactively pursue accounts
•   Began issuing data mailers in April 2008 for dates of service from October 2007 and
forward

16

 6/29/2009 


Cook County Bureau of Health and Hospital Services

Medicare Bad Debt Review:
Critical Issues
•   Critical Date: September 30,2009
•   If PCG determines that issuance of collection letters is necessary to collect
Medicare bad debt reimbursement, PCG would like Board approval to move
forward with collection mailings by this date
•   Mailings would occur throughout the fall starting on November 1
•   3 mailings, 30 days apart

•   Delinquent accounts would be sent to a collection agency in February 2010
•   Timeline would allow for BHHS to recall accounts from collection agency during
FY2010 so accounts can by included on FY2010 cost report
•   Collection efforts must cease at the outside collection agency in same fiscal year
that bad debts are included on cost report

•   Critical Date: November 30, 2009
•   End of current fiscal year
•   What actions can be taken by BHHS immediately to include claim for Medicare
bad debt on FY2009 cost report?
•   Collection efforts must cease at the outside collection agency in same fiscal year
that bad debts are included on cost report
