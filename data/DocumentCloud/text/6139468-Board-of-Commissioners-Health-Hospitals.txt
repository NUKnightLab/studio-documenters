PROPOSED RESOLUTION
IN OPPOSITION TO THE RELOCATION OF THE
COOK COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH
TO THE OAK FOREST HOSPITAL OF COOK COUNTY CAMPUS
WHEREAS, the Cook County Department of Public Health has been located at its current
location at 1010 Lake Street in Oak Park, Illinois since 1992, having relocated from its
Maybrook County Courthouse facility for the purpose of providing additional courtrooms;
and
WHEREAS, the facility is centrally located in Cook County in downtown Oak Park,
accessible to the CTA Green Line and the Blue Line, the METRA railroad line and the
Eisenhower Expressway and numerous PACE and CTA bus lines; and
WHEREAS, the facility includes the Departmentâ€™s administration offices, various
educational programs, and public information resources, which are utilized by
municipalities, public and private schools, community groups, the press and the public;
and
WHEREAS, Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County is located in the far southwest section
of the County and is not nearly as accessible as the Oak Park location; and
WHEREAS, the Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County site requires the expenditure of
public funds, which far outweigh a long term rental of space in a central location; and
WHEREAS, the people of Cook County and their municipalities and schools are better
served in an accessible, central location, which has been utilized as such for the past
seventeen years.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and Board of
Commissioners direct that all efforts and expenditures planned for the relocation of the
Cook County Department of Public Health be terminated.
*Referred to the Committee on Health and Hospitals on 02-04-09.
