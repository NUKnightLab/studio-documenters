BUDGET ADMINISTRATION COMMITTEE
Agenda Item (3) 20I8 Audit Report

Mr. Carl Naso addressed the Board and stated that the 2018 external audit was completed and
resulted in a clean opinion. The audit states that our ?nancial statements are presented fairly in all
the material aSpects. An audit exit conference was held on June 17 and Director Ramsey was in
attendance. Mr. Naso noted that the auditors tested the Port?s internal accounting controls. While
the auditors don?t issue an opinion on the internal controls, no de?ciencies were found.

BUDGET ADMINISTRATION COMMITTEE
Agenda Item (3) May Financial Statement

 

Mr. Carl Naso addressed the Board and referred to pages 36-37 of the Agenda. He noted that
several projects were in the pipeline but some, like have pulled back. At this point
we?re not sure if they?ll come back or not. Mr. Friedman added that the Port remains engaged and
would like to see them return. Mr. Naso noted that the trend now is residential and mixed? use
projects. Developers have told us that it?s difficult to reach the 100% prevailing wage. Mr.
Friedman added that over the past 5 years the projects have been mostly residential and mixed?
use. and they?re smaller projects, which makes it dif?cult for contractors to meet the policy 100%.
Chair Roller stated she?d like to see developers accept that prevailing wage is the new way of
doing business in Cuyahoga County. Mr. Naso stated that in the past the Port has generated
approximately $1 million in revenue, if the current pace continues, the Port will need to ?nd other
sources of income. Mr. Friedman stated that management will need to make conservative
assumptions about the future. Management will need to focus on how to generate revenue
elsewhere and will have to closely monitor Spending. We can no longer count on a $3 million/year
bond financing projects.

BUDGET ADMINISTRATION COMMITTEE
Agenda Item 4 (C) (3 Key Performance Indicators

It was decided that the Port?s Key Performance Indicators will be presented at the next meeting.
