Mr. Foley provided an overview of the meeting’s agenda and explained the purpose of the meeting. He
stated that this meeting is to prepare the Board for the October 7th retreat. He then introduced John
Abendshien from Integrated Clinical Solutions, Inc.
Mr. Abendshien introduced his team and proceeded with the presentation (Attachment #1).
The Board reviewed and discussed the information.
One issue discussed was the provision of long-term care at Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County.
Questions were raised with regard to community needs and the reason why the System outsources these
services. Randall Mark, Director of Policy Analysis for the System, provided background information
relating to when these services were outsourced in 2007; a cost analysis done at the time indicated that
outsourcing would be more economical. Sylvia Edwards, Chief Operating Officer of Oak Forest Hospital
of Cook County, added that Oak Forest Hospital’s services for long-term care were based upon a hospital
model, which is what drove the costs up.
The Board discussed capital planning issues. Mr. Foley stated that he has recently met with the County’s
Department of Facilities Management and Office of Capital Planning and Policy regarding the old Cook
County Hospital Building. Additionally, he addressed two major capital priorities – Stroger Campus
parking and the Fantus Clinic.
Director Zopp inquired whether the System must go through the County for capital needs if they find the
funding for the projects themselves. John Morales, Chief Financial Officer of John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital
of Cook County, responded that the County’s Office of Capital Planning and Policy manages these projects
because they have the engineers, etc. on staff, and historically, the long-term bond money has been
controlled by Capital Planning. He stated that it wouldn’t be impossible for the System to break off and
manage their own projects, however, there would need to be an infrastructure in place at the System in
order to manage these projects. He added that it may be possible to meet with the Cook County Board to
address the possibility of the System getting moved up in the order of priority for capital projects.
The Board concluded by discussing key questions on major strategic issues. Mr. Abendshien stated that
this information would be helpful in preparing for the October 7th retreat, at which the Board will have an
extended discussion period on the subject.
