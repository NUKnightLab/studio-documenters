DATE OF COMPLETE APPLICATION: 09-23-2019
STAFF SITE VISIT: 09-25-2019

PREPARED BY: A. PHILLIPS

SCOPE: GENERAL REHABILITATON -- SIGNAGE & EXTERIOR PATIO
EXISTING CONDITIONS
The building located at 634 Selden Street is a 2-story commercial structure constructed ca. 1920 as a butter factory
and creamery for the Blue Valley Creamery. The steel structure is clad in variegated red brick and features cast stone
detailing. The south/front façade (Selden Street) of the building includes double hung divided light windows at the
first and second floors. The primary entrance to the building is located at the west edge of the front elevation. The
west/side façade of the building is not visible as it abuts the adjacent building. The east/side (Redmond Plaza)
currently has seven window openings of varying widths at the second floor only. The only existing masonry opening
at the first floor is a wide person door located toward the rear of the elevation. A parapet surrounds the flat roof of the
structure.

PROPOSAL
With the current proposal, the applicant is seeking the Commission’s approval to perform a general rehabilitation
of the building per the attached drawings and application. Included in the proposal are the following scope items:
• South/Front Elevation
o Signage
 24’ x 4’ building-mounted sign to be centered on the elevation between first and second floors. The
sign will be “reverse lit” channel letters on a black aluminum frame background.
 Blade sign to be located at the eastern edge of the elevation and mounted so the bottom of the sign
falls 13’ above grade. The sign is to be 10”-12”D x ~8’H x 18” – ~3’W and constructed of aluminum
per the attached drawings. The “CONDADO” portion of the sign will contain red push through letters
on a black aluminum background. The red letters will be internally illuminated and the perimeter of
the sign will contain a border of individual light bulbs. The “Tacos” portion of the sign will include

 digitally printed acrylic which will be internally illuminated. The red arrow portion of the sign will
include red acrylic faces and be internally illuminated.
• East/Plaza Side Elevation
o (1) New masonry opening (~7’W x 7’H) for pedestrian entrance and side light at south end of elevation
including:
 Black metal canopy/signage to finish 9’ above grade – Size: 8’-9”W x 1’-10”H x 3’-6”D
• Sign to be externally illuminated by (2) new black metal gooseneck lamps
• The lower portion of the sign will be internally illuminated.
 (2) new up/down light wall sconces located on either side of door/side light
 New black aluminum storefront door and side light window
 New 5’ x 5’ frost slab in front of door
o (2) New masonry openings (~16’ x 10’) for (2) new overhead doors with clear tempered glass panels and
black frames
o (1) New masonry opening (~3’W x 7’H) for second pedestrian entrance toward north end of elevation.
Similar to pedestrian door listed above, a new 5’ x 5’ frost slab is proposed in front of the door. The finish
of the door will match that of the pedestrian door listed above.
o New 10’W x 60’L concrete dining patio including:
 (4) 6” square black light posts (10’-4” in height) and associated concrete footings
 String lights (non-blinking, clear lamps @ 12” O.C.) around perimeter of patio between light posts
 3’ high black metal railing, graphic panels (logo), gate posts and gates around the perimeter of patio
and associated concrete footings.
 New patio furniture (tables and chairs)
STAFF OBSERVATIONS & RESEARCH
• The side yard (location of proposed patio) is visible from right-of-way
ISSUES
• The blade sign, as proposed, does not meet the Historic District Commission’s Signs and Awning
Guidelines—specifically as it relates to the illumination method(s), color, and material (acrylic).
RECOMMENDATION
It is staff’s opinion that the work, as proposed, does not destroy historic materials that characterize the historic
building, its site, and setting. Staff therefore recommends that the Commission approve a Certificate of
Appropriateness for the work as proposed as it meets the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation
9) New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials that
characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the
massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment.

(d)

The elements of design, as defined in Section 21-2-2 of this Code, are as follows:
(1)

Height. Single-family or small multi-unit residential structures range in height from 1½ to 2½ stories in
height. Apartment buildings typically range in height from two stories to four stories, often on high
basements; a majority of these buildings are three stories in height with high basements. The apartment
building at 70 West Alexandrine Avenue is eight stories in height. Commercial and other building types
typically range from one to two stories in height. The building at 444 West Willis Avenue, commonly
known as the Willys-Overland Building, is historically four stories in height and features a modern, set
back, fifth story addition. The building at 3933 Woodward Avenue, commonly known as the Garden

 Theater, is three stories in height. The building at 3901 Cass Avenue, commonly known as Cass Avenue
Methodist Church, features a sanctuary that is a tall, single story in height, a tower that is approximately
1½ times as tall as the sanctuary, and a two-story addition.
(2)

Proportion of buildings' front façades. Front façades of single-family or small multi-unit residential
structures are typically as tall as wide or slightly taller than wide. Front façades of apartment buildings
are commonly as tall as wide or slightly taller than wide, with the exception of broader buildings at 3761
Second Avenue, commonly known as the Coronado Apartments, 711 West Alexandrine Avenue, 495-497
West Willis Avenue, and 477 West Alexandrine Avenue, which are significantly wider than tall. Front
façades of single-story commercial buildings are significantly wider than tall, while multi-story
commercial buildings and other non-residential buildings tend to be slightly wider than tall. Buildings
often occupy most or all of deep lots, resulting in side elevations of buildings that are often substantially
wider than tall.

(3)

Proportion of openings within the façades. Openings typically amount to between 20 percent and 35
percent of the front façade. Commercial buildings often feature expansive storefront windows on their
first floors, though in many cases these windows have been covered with boards or closed with brick or
concrete block. Sash windows, taller than wide, predominate on all building types. On apartment
buildings, sash windows are sometimes arranged in groupings which, together, are square or wider than
tall. A significant minority of buildings feature arched, mullioned, semi-circular, casement, or dormer
windows appropriate to their respective architectural styles. Upper sashes and transoms are occasionally
subdivided into smaller panes. Casement windows are usually subdivided into smaller panes. Door
openings are typically slightly larger in scale than window openings. Primary entrance openings are
usually centered on the façades of commercial and apartment buildings, but are usually off-center on the
façades of smaller residential buildings.

(4)

Rhythm of solids to voids in front façades. Despite a variety of building types, the overall impression is
one of regular, repetitive openings arranged horizontally within façades. A repetitive flow of storefront
openings, where they exist, creates a rhythm along commercial frontage. Smaller residential buildings as
well as the building at 3901 Cass Avenue, commonly known as Cass Avenue Methodist Church, display
more varied, often asymmetrical, arrangements of openings, but the overall impression is still one of
regular, repetitive openings.

(5)

Rhythm of spacing of buildings on streets. Rhythm of spacing on streets is generally determined by
setbacks from side lot lines. The overall character of the district is one of densely clustered, yet visually
distinct, structures separate by narrow setbacks. Commercial buildings frequently abut adjacent
buildings, typically featured no setbacks from side lot lines, especially on Woodward Avenue where
evenly spaced storefronts create a regular spacing of buildings. There is a general regularity in the widths
of subdivision lots from one block to another, contributing to a regular rhythm of spacing of buildings on
streets.

(6)

Rhythm of entrance and/or porch projections. Porches on smaller residential buildings typically project
while those on other types of buildings usually do not. On residential buildings only, entrances are often
located several steps above grade to accommodate high basements. Doorways on smaller residential
buildings are often set beneath gable-roofed or arched openings, while doorways on other buildings are
typically centered on their façades. A regular rhythm of entrances is created by a row of similar
commercial buildings along Woodward Avenue.

(7)

Relationship of materials. A majority of buildings are faced with brick and feature stone or cast stone
trim. Single-family residential buildings are generally faced with brick and feature wooden brackets, bay

 windows, vergeboards, timbering, porch supports, dentils, entablature, or other Classically-inspired
elements, and other details depending upon style. A small number of single-family residential buildings
feature wood clapboard siding. Stone or stone facing defines the foundations of buildings at 643-647 and
748 West Alexandrine Avenue, 481 Brainard Avenue, 3957 and 4107 Cass Avenue, and 500 West Willis
Avenue, the lower levels of buildings at 4120 Cass Avenue, 3761 Second Avenue, 495-497 West Willis
Avenue, and the entire primary façade of buildings at 624 and 627 West Alexandrine Avenue and 3977
Cass Avenue. The buildings at 3901 Cass Avenue, commonly known as Cass Avenue Methodist Church,
3900 and 3977 Second Avenue, and 4100 Third Avenue are composed primarily of stone. Sash windows
are historically wood but, in many cases, have been replaced with windows of modern materials. Stone is
used for window sills on a majority of buildings within the district. While roofs within the district are
generally flat and not visible, pitched roofs typically feature visible slate or asphalt shingles. Buildings at
686 Selden and 711 West Alexandrine Avenue feature clay tile roofs. The building at 3901 Cass Avenue,
commonly known as Cass Avenue Methodist Church, features a copper roof on its tower.
(8)

Relationship of textures. On a majority of buildings within the district, the major textural effect is that of
brick with mortar joints juxtaposed with cast stone or limestone trim. Patterned brickwork is used to
create subtle detail on commercial and apartment buildings, such as spandrels and rectangular panels,
and more pronounced textural interest where it exists on the upper stories of buildings, such as at 461
West Alexandrine Avenue, and in an arcaded cornice on the building at 711 West Alexandrine Avenue.
Where they exist, detailed wooden vergeboards, gables, brackets, and dormers create considerable
textural interest on all single-family residential buildings in the district. Rough-cut stone with thick mortar
joints creates considerable textural interest on buildings where it exists, while other buildings feature
smooth stone with thin mortar joints. In general, asphalt-shingle roofs do not contribute to textural
interest.

(9)

Relationship of colors. Natural brick colors in shades of brown, red, and buff predominate on wall
surfaces, while natural stone colors in shades of gray, red, and brown also exist. Although most roofs are
flat and therefore not visible, sloped roofs typically feature gray asphalt, while some feature red or green
clay tile or slate in contrasting colors of gray, red, or green. Wooden architectural details are frequently
painted in bold colors, appropriate to the architectural style of the buildings, which contract markedly
with brick facing. Brick apartment buildings are generally unpainted, with gray stone trim contracting
with brown or buff brickwork. Brick on commercial buildings is frequently painted in shades of yellow or
orange. The original colors of any building, as determined by professional analysis, are always acceptable
for that building and may provide guidance for similar buildings.

(10)

Relationship of architectural details. Buildings in the district exemplify a broad range of architectural
styles, and their architectural details relate to their style. Pre-1880 residential buildings, as well as
commercial buildings on Woodward Avenue, are Italianate in style. Single-family residential buildings are
often Queen Anne or Stick/Eastlake in style. Romanesque Revival structures include the building at 3977
Second Avenue, commonly known as the Campbell-Symington House, and the building at 3901 Cass
Avenue, commonly known as the Cass Avenue Methodist Church. Larger apartment buildings include the
Spanish Medieval building at 624 West Alexandrine Avenue, commonly known as the El Moore Flats, and
several buildings in Beaux Arts and Colonial Revival styles. Also represented are the Jacobethan Revival,
Craftsman, Spanish Colonial, Late Gothic, and Neo-Georgian styles. Buildings range from vernacular to
high style in appearance, with the level of architectural detail varying greatly from one building to the
next.

(11)

Relationship of roof shapes. Most apartment buildings and all non-residential buildings have flat roofs

 that cannot be seen from the ground, with the exception of the building at 3901 Cass Avenue, commonly
known as Cass Avenue Methodist Church, with prominent cross gables defining its nave and transept and
a hip roof defining a two-story addition. Single-family residential buildings feature multiple roof shapes,
with steps, intersecting gables, dormers, towers, and tall chimneys creating dramatic silhouettes. Flatroofed apartment buildings often feature stepped or triangular parapet walls, occasionally with
crenellation or balustrades, which add interest to the building's roofline.
(12)

Walls of continuity. Setbacks of residential buildings tend to vary slightly from one buildings to the next,
but generally create a wall of continuity on all streets in the district, except where building demolition has
created vacant lots. The continuous façades of commercial buildings, where they exist in rows, create
significant walls of continuity in the district. Fencing, often modern steel units that resemble historic cast
or wrought iron fencing, exists at the front lot line of many properties and suggests an additional wall of
continuity. Mature trees and public lighting fixtures generally do not contribute to a wall of continuity due
to their irregular placement throughout the district.

(13)

Relationship of significant landscape features and surface treatments. The overall impression is that eastwest streetscapes are abundantly planted whereas north-south streetscapes are not. Typical treatment
of individual residential properties is a shallow, flat front lawn in grass turf, subdivided by a straight
concrete walk leading to the front entrance. Alleys provide access to the rear of a majority of lots in the
district; a small number of these lots contain garages in the rear accessed via the alley. Trees, hedges,
and other landscaping features are irregularly spaced. Trees in the front yards of buildings vary in size,
age, and species. Most commercial buildings, and a smaller number of apartment buildings, are built up
to the front lot line. Public sidewalks run alongside all streets in the district. Curbs, while historically
stone, have been replaced with concrete in a majority of the district. Public lighting is generally of the
modern, steel, pole-mounted variety, though wrought iron-style light fixtures exist on Woodward Avenue.

(14)

Relationship of open space to structures. Front and side yards range from shallow to non-existent, while
most smaller residential buildings feature rear yards. Other than public rights-of-way, large areas of open
space exist only where they have been created by building demolition; sometimes these spaces serve as
parking lots or are maintained as open lawns.

(15)

Scale of façades and façade elements. Single-family residential buildings are moderate to large in scale
relative to typical buildings from the period in which they were constructed. Apartment buildings range
from small to large in scale, with a small number of buildings, such as the building at 70 West
Alexandrine and the building at 3751-73 Second Avenue, commonly known as the Coronado Apartments,
being significantly larger in scale than the others. The building at 444 West Willis Avenue, commonly
known as the Willys-Overland building, is also large in scale. Elements within the façades are generally
small to medium in scale.

(16)

Directional expression of front elevations. Façades of single-family residential structures are generally
vertical in directional expression due to tall window and door openings and peaked rooflines. Apartment
buildings generally range from neutral to slightly vertical in directional expression, though a smaller
number are horizontal in directional expression. Commercial buildings, especially single-story ones, are
generally horizontal in directional expression due to broad storefront windows and, where they exist,
horizontal cornices.

(17)

Rhythm of building setbacks. A degree of irregularity is introduced by varying setbacks of front façades;
smaller residential buildings tend to be set back several feet from the public sidewalk, while larger
apartment buildings and other buildings often occupy their entire lots. While setbacks may vary slightly

 from one building to the next, the overall impression is one of a consistent rhythm of building setbacks.
Where building demolition has occurred, the original rhythmic progression of buildings has been
disrupted.
(18)

Relationship of lot coverages. Lot coverage within the district are generally high, but vary based on
building type. Single-family residential buildings and smaller apartment buildings often occupy between
20 percent and 40 percent of their lots, with much of the remaining space being devoted to rear yards.
Other building types range from 50 percent to 100 percent lot coverage. Large buildings may have light
courts or central courtyard spaces. Commercial buildings, in particular, often occupy a large percentage
of their lots.

(19)

Degree of complexity within the façades. The façades within the district range from simple to complex,
depending upon style. Overall, front façades tend to be simple in their massing and mostly regular in
their fenestration, though a variety of window and door shapes, materials, architectural elements, and
details of individual buildings increase the overall level of complexity of the district.

(20)

Orientation, vistas, overviews. Buildings generally face the streets and are entered from the front façades
by a single or double doorway. The tallest buildings within the district, such as the building at 70 West
Alexandrine Avenue, the building at 3901 Cass Avenue, commonly known as Cass Avenue Methodist
Church, the building at 3761 Second Avenue, commonly known as the Coronado Apartments, and the
building at 444 West Willis Avenue, commonly known as the Willys-Overland Building, constitute
landmarks that are clearly visible from several blocks away. The buildings on Woodward Avenue, visible
from a considerable distance up and down the street, are a significant component of a broader
streetscape.

(21)

Symmetric or asymmetric appearance. The appearance of front façades in the district, for the most part,
is symmetrical. Single-family residential buildings tend to display a modest degree of asymmetry in
massing and architectural detail.

(22)

General environmental character. The general character of the district is that of a medium-density,
mixed-use, urban neighborhood of small to large apartment buildings interspersed with other building
types. The district maintains a sense of vitality as a result of its mixture of uses and the correspondingly
diverse physical appearance of its buildings.

 REPORT

Signs & Awning Guidelines
“Signs often become so important to a community that they
are valued long after their role as commercial markers has
ceased. They become landmarks, loved because they have
been visible at certain street corners--or from many vantage
points across the city--for a long time. Such signs are valued
for their familiarity, their beauty, their humor, their size, or
even their grotesqueness. In these cases, signs transcend their
conventional role as vehicles of information, as identifiers of
something else. When signs reach this stage, they accumulate
rich layers of meaning. They no longer merely advertise, but
are valued in and of themselves. They become icons.”
Signs as Icons, “The Preservation of Historic Signs,” by Michael J. Auer. Preservation Brief, #25 (Technical
Preservation Services), National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior

The cultural significance of signs combined with their often transitory nature makes the preservation of
historic signs fraught with questions, problems, and paradoxes. If the common practice in every period
has been to change signs with regularity, when and how should historic signs be kept? If the business is
changing hands, how can historic signs be reused? The subject is an important one, and offers
opportunities to save elements that convey the texture of daily life from the past.

SIGNS
Objective
 To enhance the integrity of the buildings and
community by preserving and appropriately restoring
historic signs
Purpose of signage:
 To indicate the original occupants and the area’s past.
Even with a change in business, retaining historic
signage as part of the community memory is desirable
 To identify current businesses and stores
Guidelines
1. Preserve historic signage when possible
2. Restore signs only when the original has lost its visibility through age, damage, or
excessive/inappropriate cleaning
3. Create attractive commercial signs that promote business, both pedestrian and vehicular, but are
free of visual clutter
[1]

 

 4. Require that new signage compliment the historic integrity of the building and community.
Signs must relate to the building(s) they serve
5. Signs shall be restricted to those which identify the name of the establishment and/or the primary
business or service provided within.
6. Advertising related to businesses or services not provided on the premises shall be prohibited
unless, with the approval of the Commission, such advertising is deemed historically appropriate.
7. Signage should make an attempt to recognize the stylistic features and characteristics of the
historical districts in their materials and graphics
8. Signage should recognize the scale, massing, style, materials
and colors of the building and the district
Common elements of historic signage include:
 Painted facades and fascia signs
 Material inlaid into the buildings façade
 Hanging signs and older neon signs
 Gold leaf or gilded lettering in storefront windows
 

Signs Mounted on Buildings
Size
Signage must fit within the building design and its storefront and be historically compatible with the site
and context; must be compatible with building; and must not obscure architectural elements.
Shape
Shape of sign must be consistent with the character of the historic district in which the signage is
located.
Materials
 Material inlaid or carved into the buildings façade should be retained
 Sign materials should be compatible with the design theme and use of materials on the building
where the sign is to be placed.
 Painted wood and metal are preferred materials for the signs.
 Metal signs, wood signs, glass signs, and signs painted on masonry are permitted.
Position
 Locate signage above the storefront opening so that it does not conceal architectural details and
features
 Signs should be located where architectural features or details suggest a location, size, or shape
for the sign
 Signs should be placed on buildings consistent with sign location on adjacent buildings
 Limit the number of projecting signs
 In pedestrian areas, orient signs to sidewalk instead of motorists.
[2]

 

 



The bottom of hanging signs should maintain at least a 10 foot pedestrian clearance from the
sidewalk.
Signs on canopies should be twelve (12) inches away from the end edges of such canopies.
Maintain a physical separation between individual store signs so that it is clear that the sign
relates to a particular store below

Illumination
 Consider if the sign needs to be lighted
 Use external or halo lighting to illuminate building and/or storefront signage
 Lighting should fit within the building design and its storefront and be architecturally compatible
with the site and context
 With internally illuminated channel letters, limit raceways depth behind letter to five (5) inches
(2 inches when using LED light source)
Typeface/Legibility
 Use cast or fabricated metal dimensional graphics
– letters and logos – in lieu of plastic or vinyl
dimensional graphics
 Use a minimum of ½ deep metal dimensional
graphics – letters and logos.
 Selected materials should contribute to the
legibility of the sign
 Avoid faddish or bizarre typefaces
 Avoid hard to read typefaces and symbols
 Limit the number of lettering styles
Color
 Sign colors should complement the colors used on the structures and the project as a whole
 Sign colors should reflect the color system appropriate to the period of the building
 Limit the total number of colors used in any one sign
Signs not mounted on buildings (commercial development or multi-tenants identification) should
reference the following guidelines:
1. Use a ground or monumental sign not to exceed six-feet in height including the base
2. Provide a sign base of masonry, granite, or concrete with an architectural finish. A metal base on
grade is prohibited unless it is 12 inches above grade
3. Include landscaping around the base of ground and monument signs
4. Limit commercial development identification signage to a maximum of two signs (double face)
when development is on two major streets, not to exceed 150 square foot of signage
5. For pylon sings, limit height to a maximum of (12) twelve foot in height above grade including
its base and post. Limit post width to 12 inch face.
[3]

 

 6. Provide professionally made signage, including design, material, painting and construction.
7. Use signage materials that are architecturally appropriate to the historic character of the
neighborhood

AWNINGS\CANOPIES
Objective
 To enhance the integrity of the buildings and community by preserving and appropriately
restoring historic awnings and canopies
Purpose of awning
 Awnings and canopies provide protection form the elements, expand floor space, provide unity
of appearance, and create a decorative backdrop for identification.
Guidelines
1. Design awnings and canopies so as not to conceal building features such as pilasters or windows.
2. Use color schemes to coordinate with building façade colors
3. Use simple and triangular shape awnings with valance face not to exceed ten (10) inches
4. Install into mortar joints – no fastening into brick, stone or arch details.
Standards
1. Locate awnings, canopies and marquees and their supporting structure at a minimum of eight (8)
feet, six (6) inches above public sidewalk
2. Project awnings and canopies not more than one half the width of the sidewalk and not more
than 10 feet, six inches.
3. Project awnings and canopy material such as
metal, glass, or woven fabric.
4. Limit signage on awning to the valance area
(e.g., front fascia of the awning, not the sloped
area.) Include business name, address, logo, or
business “slogan,” but not to exceed 40% of
the awning valance surface area. Product
advertising is unacceptable.
5. Limit the signage area of awnings and
canopies to tat allowed per Section 61140292(5) of the City of Detroit Zoning
Ordinance.
6. Use external lighting to illuminate awnings. Internally illuminated awnings are unacceptable.

[4]

 

 7. Use awnings to define individual storefront openings. Continuous awnings along blank walls or
awnings located at upper floor windows are unacceptable.
8. Use exposed awning design with open ends and no ceiling.
Other
The awning may be attached either just below the storefront cornice or between the transom and display
windows (allowing light into the store while shading merchandise and pedestrians from the sun.)
The awning should fit within the storefront opening; i.e., should not cover the piers or space above the
cornice. Aluminum awnings or canopies generally detract from the historic character and should not be
erected.
New coverings for existing – previously approved – awnings may be administratively approved by the
coordinator if the colors, content, placement of printing and materials are appropriate.
".. . . signs (and awnings) convey the texture of daily life from the past."
Variance to the above guidelines may be granted by the Historic District Commission.
The Historic District Commission reserves all rights to amend and/or update this policy statement. Any
questions pertaining to this policy shall be directed to the Historic District Commission, 65 Cadillac
Square, Suite 1300, Detroit, Michigan 48226, telephone (313) 224-06536
