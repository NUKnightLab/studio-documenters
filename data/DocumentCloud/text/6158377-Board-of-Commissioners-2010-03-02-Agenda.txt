RESOLUTION continued
ITEM #2 cont’d
WHEREAS, Commissioner Hansen, the son of Danish immigrants, grew up in Chicago’s Humboldt Park
neighborhood during the Great Depression; and
WHEREAS, Commissioner Hansen graduated from Lane Tech High School and enlisted in the U.S.
Army in 1944, where he rose to the rank of 2nd lieutenant and was an officer of the United States High
Commission for Germany under then-General Dwight D. Eisenhower; and
WHEREAS, while overseas in the post-war period, Commissioner Hansen met his wife Christl in
Germany and was for the first and only time in his life rendered speechless for an entire hour, as he was
immediately smitten with her beauty, intelligence and grace; they married in Chicago in 1952; and
WHEREAS, Commissioner Hansen attended the University of Chicago’s graduate school where he
earned an MBA in 1954; he had a successful career in market research and started his own marketing,
management, and real estate consulting services firm in 1967; and
WHEREAS, Commissioner Hansen’s long career on the Cook County Board began in 1970 when, at the
age of 43, he was appointed to fill a ten-month vacancy created when a suburban representative died; he
subsequently ran and won election to the seat in 1974, and remained in office until 2006; and
WHEREAS, Commissioner Hansen’s appointment and subsequent election to the Cook County Board
was not his first venture into politics, as he served as Elk Grove Township Republican Committeeman
from 1962 to 2002, and was the campaign manager for the primary gubernatorial bid of Charles H. Percy
in 1962; and
WHEREAS, Commissioner Hansen’s sense of duty and responsibility to the taxpayers of Cook County
was widely known, and while he was a strong and vociferous advocate for the Northwest suburban area,
all of Cook County benefitted from his diligence and relentless commitment to and knowledge of many
issues, including those relating to pollution, water supply, flooding, waste disposal, public health, and
preservation of green space; and
WHEREAS, Commissioner Hansen did not shrink from debate even if he was the sole voice in
opposition; he had the ability to persuade one to his side of a debate with his thunderous ferocity or
conversely, through mellifluous, impassioned speeches on the floor; and
WHEREAS, one such issue in which Commissioner Hansen’s tenacity and determination greatly
impacted the residents of Cook County was in the blocking of the creation of a landfill at the Poplar
Creek Forest Preserves, which would have ruined six hundred acres of Forest Preserve land; this two-year
battle proved to be one of his proudest victories; and

ITEM #2 cont’d
WHEREAS, Commissioner Hansen’s extensive knowledge of history was evident, and he was a great
conversationalist on topics involving different ethnicities and cultures; his knowledge of and involvement
in his own Scandinavian community was not his only ethnic and cultural interest, rather, he enjoyed a
wide variety of multi-cultural relationships and attended events celebrating ethnic diversity, and was the
proud sponsor of the relationship formed in 2005 between the County of Cook and the Province of
Palermo in Sicily, Italy; and
WHEREAS, upon Commissioner Hansen’s retirement, many were amazed to find that he had kept every
County Board and Committee meeting document going back to 1970 in perfect order, complete with his
notes and backup material; this archive was donated, along with his other papers and correspondence
files, so that others could educate themselves and understand the intricacies of Cook County; and
WHEREAS, although Cook County was an important part of his life, there was nothing comparable in
importance to Commissioner Hansen than love and devotion to his family, which included his beloved
wife, Christl, who passed in 2007, son Lothar Ulrich and daughter-in-law Gudrun, cherished
granddaughter Christina, sisters Rita Scoon (deceased) and Marilyn Jackson, and sisters-in-law Iris
Draper and Uschi Choate; his commitment to family was unwavering, and his tenderness towards his wife
was palpable and inspirational to all those who have loved.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and the Cook County Board of
Commissioners, on behalf of the more than five million residents of Cook County, do hereby honor the
memory of Commissioner Carl R. Hansen, celebrate his extraordinary life, and hereby express the
gratitude of the residents of Cook County for his many years of distinguished service; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a suitable copy of this Resolution be presented to the family of
Commissioner Carl R. Hansen, as a token of our great esteem and acknowledgement of his rich legacy of
service and commitment to Cook County.

in the Consumer Price Index (CPI), with a minimum increase of 3% and a
maximum increase of 6%, which protects the Landlord from changes in the
marketplace. For the 3rd and 4th option periods, the rent will adjust to fair market
rent. In addition to the base rent, the Tenant pays directly all costs of
maintaining and operating the facility and the grounds.

Approval is recommended.
The Finance Committee of the Board of Directors of the Cook County Health & Hospitals System

ITEM #36 cont’d
1.

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
On January 22, 2010, it became apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of
funds in order to meet current obligations. At that time the balance in the account was $0, and 30
days prior to that the balance in the account was $0. The scanners reader printers were budgeted for
in FY 2010 in account 529-530, Office Furniture and Equipment. As scanners and printers are
computer equipment with a useful life of five years, the funds need to be transferred to the
appropriate account to provide for the purchase of this equipment. The fileprint printers being
replaced are repeatedly breaking down, have outlived their useful life and have recently become
obsolete. The new fileprint printers to be purchased were not budgeted for in FY 2010 as their
purchase was not anticipated at that time.

2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
Account 529-530, Office Furniture and Equipment was identified as the source of transferred funds
for the purchase of the scanners reader printers as the funds for purchasing these equipment were
budgeted for in FY 2010 in this account. Account 260, Professional and Managerial Services was
identified as the source of transferred funds for the purchase of the fileprint printers as this account
has sufficient funds to meet the needed amount. No other accounts were considered.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from Accounts 529-530 and 529-260.
None.

4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
The funds for the purchase of the scanners reader printers were budgeted in FY 2010 in account
530, Office furniture and Equipment. As the scanners reader printers should be categorized as
computer equipment, the budgeted funds need to be transferred to the computer equipment account
to provide for their purchase. As to the purchase of the fileprint printers, when account 260,
Professional and Managerial Services was budgeted for, expected and unexpected future
expenditures were considered.

requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners to transfer funds totaling $12,400.00 from and to the
accounts listed below to make Cook County residents aware of this service that has been provided for
their benefit to ultimately help combat property fraud.
Reason:

Office to make Cook County residents aware of this service that has been provided for their
benefit to ultimately help combat property fraud.

Advertising For a Specific Purpose

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
On December 31, 2009, it became apparent the Recorder of Deeds office needed to add a new
account to the Special Purpose Fund to advertise the Property Deeds Fraud Hot-Line number in
local newspapers and other media sources for Cook County Residents. The Recorder's Office did
not have the Advertising for a Specific Purpose in the 2010 budget. This account did not
exist thirty days prior to that.

2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.

TRANSFER OF FUNDS continued
ITEM #41 cont’d
Accounts 570-246, 570-355 and 571-246 were identified as the source of transfer because the
Recorder's office decided that these funds were no longer required due to the digital imaging of
microfilm records. The Property Fraud unit does not require Imaging of Records. Sufficient funds
are in the Document Storage account 527-246 Imaging of Records for this purpose.
3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from (570-246, 570-355 and 571-246 Accounts.
None.

4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
The Accounts 570-246, 570-355 and 571-246 were originally budgeted in this account because
there was a need for the Imaging of Records and Photographic/Reproduction Supplies. After the
new Property Fraud unit was established it was determined that the unit did not require the need for
Imaging of Records. Sufficient funds are budgeted in the Document Storage Account 527-246,

TRANSFER OF FUNDS continued
ITEM #54 cont’d
The account (211-260) used for transfer of funds was identified because it was previously used to
fund the obligation of psychological testing of Sheriff’s Office sworn personnel recruits. Due to the
need to fill existing vacant Correctional Officers positions and the order by the Federal Judge in the
Duran Consent Decree to hire 210 correctional officers this year, the occurrence of psychological
testing on potential recruits will increase from approximately 300 Correctional Officers to 800.
Therefore we are transferring all the funding into the Department of Corrections account to pay for
this increase of psychological testing of Correctional Officer recruits. The account (239-333) used
for transfer of funds was identified because a change in the specifications for mattresses for the
Department of Corrections led to the contract being awarded for significantly less than the previous
year’s cost, which is what had been budgeted for FY 2010.
3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from 211-260 and 239-333.
There is nothing that will be deferred, delayed, or cancelled as a result of the reduction in account
(211-260). There is nothing that will be deferred, delayed, or cancelled as a result of the reduction
in account (239-333).

4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
Account (211-260) does not have a surplus; the funds are being transferred in order for the contract
to be increased due to the need to fill existing vacant Correctional Officers positions and the order
by the Federal Judge in the Duran Consent Decree to hire an additional 210 Correctional Officers.
Account (239-333) has a surplus due to the mattress contract for the Department of Corrections
being awarded for significantly less than the previous year’s cost, which is what had been budgeted
for FY 2010.
