protection for land in Illinois, and is granted only to natural areas of regional and state-wide ecological
significance; and
WHEREAS, Jens Jensen Grassland and Woodland Land and Water Reserve is an approximately 220
acre, high quality portion of the larger Jens Jensen preserve also known as Deer Grove East located in
the Village of Palatine in northwest Cook County. The site consists of remnant mesic woodlands and
sedge meadows, along with reconstructed prairie and wetlands supporting 398 species of native plants
and 25 bird species recognized as species in greatest need of conservation; and

WHEREAS, extensive restoration has been underway at the site since 2007 in partnership with
Openlands as a part of an O’Hare Modernization Mitigation Account project, which provides mitigation
of off-site wetland impacts resulting from the O'Hare Modernization Program; and
WHEREAS, this large-scale habitat restoration initiative was undertaken in conjunction and in
cooperation with the Chicago District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Chicago Department
of Aviation; and

WHEREAS, storm water modeling that encompassed the Jens Jensen Grassland and Woodland Land
and Water Reserve has shown a significant increase in the amount of storm water staying on site because
of the previously mentioned hydrologic and plant community restoration activities; and
WHEREAS, Jens Jensen Grassland and Woodland Land and Water Reserve has also benefitted from
extensive long-term volunteer stewardship by the Deer Grove Natural Area Volunteers, whose countless
hours of service and dedication have helped make the site what it is today and will help it continue to
thrive into the future; and
WHEREAS, dedication of Jens Jensen Grassland and Woodland as a Land and Water Reserve advances
the goal set forward in the Next Century Conservation Plan to dedicate 20,000 acres as Illinois Nature
Preserve protected land by 2025.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of the Forest Preserves
of Cook County does hereby acknowledge this momentous dedication and the Forest Preserves' steadfast

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
RECOGNITION OF THE BIRD THE PRESERVES INITIATIVE, A SUCCESSFUL
COLLABORATION TO CONNECT PEOPLE WITH THE FOREST PRESERVES OF COOK
COUNTY
WHEREAS, the Forest Preserves of Cook County’s nearly 70,000 acres of natural lands are home to
some of the nation’s most biologically diverse flora and fauna, including nearly 300 types of resident and
migrant birds, both common and unusual, that depend on Forest Preserves’ habitat; and
WHEREAS, birding is one of the most popular recreational activities in America and can serve as a
gateway activity to a greater connection with the natural world, and is an excellent way to introduce
people to the forest preserves, providing a positive, healthy, and fun experience in nature; and
WHEREAS, Bird the Preserves is an initiative that connects diverse communities to the Preserves by
expanding birding programs and activities, celebrating the migration stories that people and birds share,
and establishing the Preserves as a premier birding destination in the Chicago Wilderness region; and
WHEREAS, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service through Chicago Wilderness provided federal funding to
the Preserves to launch the Bird the Preserves initiative in 2016; and
WHEREAS, over 17 partner organizations representing birding clubs, non-profits, and government
agencies worked together to successfully implement the Bird the Preserves initiative throughout 2016,
holding more than 220 bird walks and related events; and
WHEREAS, the Bird the Preserves initiative included a Big Year competition, a yearlong friendly
contest where teams from throughout Cook County adopted different preserves and competed to find the
most bird species and recruit the most new birders at that preserve. The Chicago Botanic Garden and
Brookfield Zoo also formed teams and promoted the initiative; and
WHEREAS, the Big Year was a resounding success and had 21 official teams that spotted a total of 253
species of birds and had an estimated 2,400 people participate in bird walks and events--35% of whom
were new birders, 35% had never birded in the forest preserves before, and over 190 unique zip codes
were represented; and
WHEREAS, the Bird the Preserves initiative has proven so successful at connecting people with the
Preserves, that the Preserves has sought and received additional funding from the Forest Preserve
Foundation to incorporate elements of the Bird the Preserves initiative into the Preserves’ permanent
program offerings; and
Page 6 of 30

 Journal of Proceedings
FPD Board of Commissioners

April 11, 2017

WHEREAS, the initiative’s successful communications and marketing campaign, led by the Preserves
and partners, resulted in Bird the Preserves stories featured in nearly 20 online and print publications,
on-air media coverage from FOX and WCIU’s You and Me This Morning, a 593% increase in page
views on the Preserves’ birding webpage, and a major social media presence utilizing the hashtag
#birdthepreserves; and
WHEREAS, Bird the Preserves is consistent with the goal of the Forest Preserves to increase
connections between people and nature.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that we, the Board of Commissioners of the Forest
Preserve District of Cook County, on behalf of ourselves and staff, do hereby congratulate the partners,
Big Year teams, field trip leaders, staff, funders, and participants of Bird the Preserves on their success in
launching a unique and influential initiative that can serve as a model for both the Forest Preserves and
others; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that this Resolution be spread upon the permanent Record of
Proceedings of the Board of Commissioners of the Forest Preserve District of Cook County, and that a

& Associates’ proposal the most responsive, with particular strengths in experience, expertise and
performance capacity as it related to the work as requested in the contract specifications.

Summary: MWRD, under an agreement with the United States Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) for
the design and
construction, proposes to repair, rehabilitate, and replace the Lyons Levee to protect against a 100-year
flood event. In April 2013, floodwater from the Des Plaines River overtopped the Lyons Levee and
flooded a portion of the Village of Forest View. The FPCC acquired the property containing the Lyons
Levee along the Des Plaines River from MWRD in 1950. The conveyance deed provided that the grantee
(the FPCC) would continue to maintain the existing or new levees. The proposed 11.21 acre permanent
easements and 1.05 acre temporary easement will provide access and right of entry to MWRD and the
Corps for the construction, operation and maintenance of the levee. The proposed agreement is subject to
final review and approval by the FPCC’s Legal Department.

Request: Authorization to apply for grant
Page 20 of 30

 Journal of Proceedings
FPD Board of Commissioners

April 11, 2017

Purpose: Authorization to apply for grant funds and match funds if awarded for the repair of an
underpass at 119th and LaGrange Road in Palos Park, IL.
Grant Amount: $200,000.00
Grant Period: Two (2) years from entering into formal agreement with Illinois Department of Natural
Resources
Fiscal Impact: $40,000.00
Accounts: Trail Accounts 51025-560063, 51026-560063, 51054-560063, 51055-560063,
51056-560063, 51057-560063, 51009-560063, and all future trail accounts
Concurrences: The Chief Financial Officer and Chief Attorney have approved this item.
District(s): 17
Summary: Approval of resolution authorizing the Preserves to apply for a grant and, if awarded, to
provide match funds and enter into an agreement with the Illinois Department of Natural Resources. The
RTP grant would provide funding primarily for the repair of an underpass at 119th and LaGrange in
Palos Park, Illinois. The underpass repairs and other related trail repairs would enhance the popular 8.1
mile loop trail that connects to the Sag Valley Trail System. The repair of this underpass would ensure
that visitors have a safe and convenient way to connect to the trail system and would contribute to the
overall enhancement of the trail system.
