Summary: Please accept this letter as the Village of Glenwood?s application to participate in the Cook
County No Cash Bid Program for the 2017 County Scavenger Sale for the parcels of property identi?ed.
In the event these parcels are not eligible for the No Cash Bid Program, the Village is alternatively
requesting that an Over-TheCounter- tax certi?cate be issued and assigned to the Village of Glenwood.
This request package is for the three (3) adjacent PINS listed above. The requested PTNs are contiguous
parcels that contain a vacant dilapidated abandoned commercial site that was previously occupied by a
restaurant that has been closed for three (3) years. At the time the property was abandoned, the Village
attempted to work with the business occupying the parcels to see if it could utilize available TIF
incentives to improve the structure so that the restaurant can continue to operate. Ultimately, the Village
concluded that the costs of rehabilitating this structure so that it could continue to be useable as a
restaurant was far more than the value of the entire site. The structure on this property has continued to
deteriorate and the Village believes that it is now in a dangerous condition. It is the Village of
Glenwood?s desire to obtain title to this property so that it can demolish the hazardous structure located
on this property so that the property can be redeveloped by a private entity,'returned to the property tax
rolls and create additional employment opportunities within the Village. This parcel is in the Village of
Glenwood?s Main Street Tax Increment Financing District. Accordingly, TIF incentives as allowed by
the Tax Increment Allocation Redevelopment Act would be available to incentivize the acquisition and
redevelopment of this parcel by a private entity.

In the event this application is approved, it is the Village?s intent to ?le the necessary documents that are
required to obtain a taxexempt? status for the property. The Village will continue to maintain this tax
exempt status for the property as long as the Village continues to own it. Please be advised that the
Village does not have any agreement to convey the perfected tax deed for the property to any developer,
organization or other private party. The Village also has not entered into any negotiations with any
developer, organization, or other entity pertaining to this property. The Village?s is not acting on behalf
of any third party requester.

In the event this application is approved, the Village has by resolution authorized me to proceed to obtain
the tax deed. It will be the Village?s responsibility to bear all legal and other costs that are necessary for
its acquisition of the property through the tax deed process. The Village understands and agrees that it
will need to comply with the reporting requirements of the County?s No Cash Bid Ordinance. This will
require the Village to submit No Cash Bid Reports on the status of the parcel for the later of either ?ve
(5) years or the completion of the development.

A motion was made by Commissioner Butler, seconded by Commissioner Moody, to recommend
for approval 17?2673. The motion carried by the following vote:

Ayes: Sims, Goslin, Butler, Moody and Tobolski (5)
