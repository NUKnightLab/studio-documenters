III. Action Items
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)
With regard to request number 9, Douglas Elwell, Chief Executive Officer of Finance and Strategy, provided
additional information. He stated that the vendor, Human Resources Development Institute, Inc. (HRDI), provides
services right next door to the Community Triage Center (CTC) and works with basically the same police departments
and the same offices, so it made more sense to combine it. They are going to provide additional services in the
building, including primary care and sexually transmitted infection services. The previous vendor is a very fine
company, but they have never really been located in that part of the community. For about the same cost, HRDI will
provide the two (2) additional services and will take over responsibility of collecting fees; the contract amount will be
reduced by a percentage of the fees they are able to collect. With regard to a question pertaining to referral patterns
and whether HRDI might be able to habitually self-refer, Mr. Elwell stated that the administration will be able to
monitor it in two (2) ways: 1) HRDI is part of the Behavioral Health Consortium and has certain obligations as a part
of that, to refer a person to someone who is close to that person’s home and has evidence-based practices; and 2)
CCHHS is going to take over the triage line. He noted that the triage line will now be staffed with clinical people,
instead of clerical people.
Chairman Estrada noted that his organization is involved in a major violence reduction and peace building effort in
Roseland. He offered to host a meeting there or at another place in Roseland; they can invite the Chicago Police
Department and the four (4) major players in the violence reduction initiative, so they can not only help with referrals
but also help with awareness of the program.
With regard to request number 11, Board Chairman Hammock inquired whether this contract includes providing
window washing services for the new Central Campus Health Center. Mr. Jones responded in the negative; he stated
that the contract will need to be amended and increased at a later date to include that building.
Director Reiter, seconded by Board Chairman Hammock, moved the approval of
request numbers 1 through 13, subject to completion of review by Contract
Compliance, where appropriate. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

C. Any items listed under Section III

IV. Report from Chief Procurement Officer
A. Report of emergency purchases
There was no report of emergency purchases made.

V.

Report from the Chief Financial Officer
Chairman Estrada provided an update on financial reports. He stated that, in the month of January, staff are in the
process of closing the books for the end of the fiscal year, so it is a challenge to get the November financials
finalized in time for the January Finance Committee Meeting.

V.

Report from the Chief Financial Officer
Mr. Elwell stated that the preliminary year-end financials are typically shared at the February meeting, as January
15th is the close-off date for recording invoices for the end of the year. Additionally, he stated that an outside
review of the Incurred But Not Reported claims for the health plan by Milliman is due today, so the timing of
getting that done is not conducive to presenting finalized reports in January. He expects to have some preliminary
information available in time for next week’s Board Meeting.
Board Chairman Hammock requested an update on the discussions held at the recent Cook County Finance
Committee Meeting regarding CCHHS accounts receivable. Ekerete Akpan, Chief Financial Officer, stated that
Commissioners Richard Boykin and John Daley had requested that CCHHS administration appear at this hearing
to discuss CCHHS billing and collection practices. He offered to share the slide deck of information that was
presented at that hearing. At the hearing, they reviewed the current process and made it clear that it is a complex
process that is very regulated. They also reviewed how to go about recovering a debt. They walked through the
following: revenue cycle process and the administration’s expectations as they build out capacity, patient
registration, coding, the chargemaster, and the direction that is in Strategic Plan regarding investing in new
processes. What really interested the Commissioners was regarding when a patient bill is sent out – how does that
bill look for different populations, and how does CCHHS go about collecting that bill?
Mr. Akpan stated that the administration has put out a Request for Proposals (RFP) to factor the debt. This means
that the administration will have interested parties come in to look at the patient account receivables and come up
with proposals. He noted that, at the hearing, one of the commissioners reminded the administration of the
challenges that come with factoring out patient account receivables. There is a potential exposure of the brand for
the hospital, Board and County whenever a receivable debt is factored out, and the administration will have to be
very deliberate with this. Mr. Elwell provided an example of a case in Illinois not long ago in which a few not-forprofit hospitals became very aggressive with collections and even foreclosed on some people’s houses; the
Attorney General actually stripped them of their not-for-profit status for a period of time and made them taxable.
He stated that that there is a big difference between “we can do better at collecting” and extraordinarily aggressive
activity, which can backfire.
Board Chairman Hammock inquired whether the RFP will be based on selling the receivables or on collecting a fee
for whatever they are able to collect. Mr. Akpan responded that either is possible. Mr. Elwell indicated that the
administration will evaluate it in terms of whether it makes financial sense, as well as whether it makes sense in
terms of the way people are treated in the collection efforts. Effectively, an organization does not raise money
when it is fee-based, as the organization is essentially just replacing its collection agency with another collection
agency. The only way the organization will get a cash bolus is by selling the receivables. Regardless of the
outcome of the RFP, the administration will share the results with the Finance Committee. Board Chairman
Hammock noted that this will be a factor in balancing the overall budget; if there is money to be had there, the
Finance Committee needs to know. He stated that the Committee also needs to know some historic record on the
percentage of collections from CCHHS’ current vendors and over time for comparison.
Board Chairman Hammock requested an update on the acquisition of new members from Aetna. Mr. Elwell stated
that the transaction closed on January 1, 2018. There was a drop in membership in December in the Aetna and
Family Health Network (FHN) populations; this was not unexpected, but it was a bit larger than what was
expected. Staff are monitoring this on a daily basis, to determine whether the drop was due to people making other
choices for their health plans or whether it was related to the State’s recent system snafu (the State accidentally
dropped 40,000 people from Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits during their system transition).
He noted that, for both Aetna and FHN, that drop in membership saved CCHHS money on the purchase price. In
January, there were no drops, so membership has stayed flat – if that works out, the organization will end up in a
significantly better position than anticipated.

Report from the Chief Financial Officer
Mr. Elwell stated that the administration has seen the State’s new algorithm for auto-assignment effective January
1st; CountyCare and Harmony are getting the most members, based on the structure that the State put together. At
the start, CountyCare is expected to get 27 ½ % of all members in Cook County who are autoassigned.
Additionally, the administration has also recently completed the final negotiation with the State on rates; while it is
expected that the State will review them in six (6) months, the administration is pleased with the rates that were set.
Mr. Elwell informed the Committee of another recent development. He stated that the organization has been trying
to get into Blue Cross HMOI; that suddenly moved forward very rapidly at the end of the year. The organization
met all the requirements and got in; they received 3,300 patients, which far exceeded what was anticipated. Staff
are making sure that the infrastructure is in place to handle that smoothly; they are pushing forward in a more rapid
manner.
Board Chairman Hammock requested an update in the near future on the new Central Campus Health Center
building. He is interested to know whether the costs have aligned with the budget, and whether the final amount
will come in near the original amount planned. Mr. Elwell responded that the Board will receive an update on that
as part of the Report from the Chief Executive Officer. Chairman Estrada requested that information also be
presented regarding compliance with the goals set for Minority and Women-Owned Business participation for the
project.
