Proposed Development: IAHI Phase II Stage 2
 The developer, Home First Illinois (HFI) received State funds to acquire 200 condo units in Cook
County, including 45 located in Chicago, to be retrofitted for wheelchair users transitioning out
of nursing homes. The Chicago units were acquired in 2 phases.
 Phase I, consisting of 20 units in two stages, was approved by the CHA Board in August 2012
and in May 2013. Phase I is fully leased.
 CHA Board approved Phase II Stage 1, consisting of 14 units, in July 2014. 8 of the 14 units are
now leased and leasing is underway for the other 6 units.
 At this, time HFI has acquired the remaining 11 units in the second and final stage of Phase II,
consisting of five studio and six one-bedroom apartments in six condominium buildings located
in five community areas.
 These units will count toward CHA’s 200-unit Section 811 commitment to the State.
Developer Background
 HFI, a subsidiary of IFF, was created to develop and own supportive housing for very lowincome people with disabilities.
 HFI received $11.5 million in Build Illinois Bonds funds from IHDA in 2013 to develop accessible
housing for households referred through the Money Follows the Person (MFP) program.
 All 20 units in Phase I and 8 units in Phase II are now under a PRA contract, with the other 6
pending HQS inspections.
 The units will be managed by Affordable Property Management Specialists, which has been in
business since 2006 and currently manages four LIHTC projects in 10 buildings totaling 275 units
in the City.
Developer Financing
 Build Illinois Bond Funds: $2.2M (for Phase II Stage 2)
 IFF First Mortgage: $330,000
Waiting List / Occupancy Process
The owner/manager of IAHI Phase II Stage 2 will lease all of the PRA-assisted units to physically
disabled applicants referred from the State of Illinois’ Money Follows the Person program. Any
applicants that are also on CHA’s waiting list will be given a priority preference.
Conclusion
The Board action recommended in this item complies in all material respects with all applicable
Chicago Housing Authority Board policies and all applicable federal laws.
The CEO/President recommends the approval to execute a HAP contract for Illinois Accessible Housing
Initiative Phase II Stage 2.
