Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Audit Committee of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County met pursuant to
notice on Tuesday, February 9, 2010 at the hour of 1:30 P.M. in the Board Room, Room 569,
County Building, 118 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois.
Chairman Daley called the meeting to order, and entered into the record a copy of a letter from
his office to the Clerk of the Circuit Court (Attachment A), and a copy of a letter to Cook County
Auditor Laura Burman, from Kurt F. Schmid, Executive Director of Chicago High Intensity Drug
Trafficking Area (Attachment B).
Jaye Morgan Williams, Chief Financial Officer, stated there were numerous improvements in
operating activities during Fiscal Year 2008, resulting in a net reduction in the number of control
deficiencies, significant deficiencies and material weaknesses identified by the auditors.
For example, in 2007 there were seventeen control deficiencies, nine significant deficiencies,
and four material weaknesses. For 2008, those figures dropped to thirteen, six, and three,
respectively. The audit took twelve months to complete, more than twice the length of time
recommended by auditing standards. This was due to transitioning activities and staff changes.

Furthermore, the added workload caused by the State’s Attorney’s investigation (concluded),
contributed to the delay.
The Bureau of Finance is planning a more aggressive audit timeframe this year and fully
expects the 2009 audit to be completed by the end of June.
Tracey Guidry, Audit Director, Deloitte & Touche, presented the Committee with an overview of
the 2008 audit process (Attachment C), including the scope of work, members of the team, and
summary of recommendations. Ms. Guidry also discussed various changes to the audit process
required by the Government Accounting Standards Board (GASB).
Ms. Guidry referenced a memo dated November 25, 2009, from the Chief Financial Officer
(Attachment D). This memo concluded that no evidence of inappropriate business practices
was found during a recent investigation of the County’s finances. Ms. Guidry affirmed that this
memo satisfied Deloitt’s requirement for third party assurance.
Chairman Daley stated his concern that all departments and agencies in county government
must cooperate fully, in a timely manner, with any request for information from any member of
the audit team. He directed Ms. Guidry to inform the Committee if any lack of cooperation
becomes apparent in the future.
Your Committee commenced consideration of the audits and report:

the supervisor assigned to the shift. The room is monitored by video camera 7 days a week and
24 hours a day. The food inventory is done weekly by the food service director, and a written
policy and procedure manual is in place to ensure compliance. A year-end inventory was
performed on January 8, 2010 for the 2009 year. This inventory was accurate, and reconciled
with the records to show the theft problem has been addressed.
Commissioner Peraica asked about inventory controls at the Department of Homeland Security
and Emergency Management.
David Ramos, Executive Director of the Department of Homeland Security and Emergency
Management, stated that a new asset tracking system is under development. He is working
