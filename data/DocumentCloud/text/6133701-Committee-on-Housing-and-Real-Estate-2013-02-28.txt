 CREATION AND PRESERVATION
OF AFFORDABLE RENTAL UNITS

Multifamily Rehab and New Construction
At the start of 2012, the Department projected commitments of over $288 million to support
more than 6,000 units of affordable rental housing using loans for new construction or rehab
along with rental subsidies.
For the full year, HED committed $202 million in resources to support 4,635 units. these
numbers represent 75% of the annual multifamily unit goal and 70% of the multifamily
resource allocation goal.

Shops and Lofts at 47
On October 31 the City Council approved a $45.6 million, mixed-use development featuring
96 rental units and a Wal-Mart Neighborhood Market in the Grand Boulevard community.
The project, Shops & Lofts at 47, will be located primarily on a vacant, City-owned site at
47th Street and Cottage Grove Avenue. It will consist of a new five-story mixed-use building
along with two new six-flats, a new nine-flat and a rehabilitated three-flat.
The $33.5 million residential component, to be developed by The Community Builders I
will contain 44 affordable, 28 public housing and 24 market-rate apartments. Public sector
support will include $11.4 million in TIOME loan, a $7.8 million
loan from the CHA, a total of $9.1 million in tax credits and up to $20 million in tax-exempt
bonds for construction financing.
The ground floor of the mixed-use building will
contain 55,000 square feet of retail space, of
which 41,000 square feet has been committed
for the Wal-Mart grocery store. An additional
14,000 square feet will be offered for leasing to
small retailers during the construction phase.
Ground-level parking on the site will provide
space for 66 vehicles.
Shops & Lofts is one of three major HEDassisted developments now moving ahead on the
47th Street corridor. Together, these projects will
create almost 350 new housing units and more
than 160,000 square feet of retail space.
A new Wal-Mart Neighborhood Market will anchor a three-acre, $46 million residential and commercial
development on the southwest corner of 47th Street and Cottage Grove Avenue in the 4th Ward.

 Dorchester Artist Housing
On December 13 the City approved a total of $1.1 million in tax credits for the creation of
a 32-unit, mixed-income artists’ colony through the rehabilitation of vacant CHA-owned
housing in the South Shore community. Dorchester Artist Housing will contain 13 two- and
19 three-bedroom units, along with an arts center. Eleven of the units will be reserved for
former public housing tenants and restricted to 50% AMI; 12 units will be at 60% AMI; and 9
units will be unrestricted. The buildings, formerly known as Dorchester/Dante Townhomes,
will be donated by CHA and the land leased for 99 years.
The two-story, red brick buildings on the site will be restored to their original modern design.
All major systems will be replaced, including HVAC, electric, plumbing, roofs, kitchens and
baths, along with new landscaping. The arts center, located in the center of the development,
will complement the residential buildings with a decorative glass façade, creating an open and
inviting atmosphere for performing, creating and displaying art.
The $11.8 million development, a joint venture of Brinshore Development and the
nonprofit Rebuild Foundation, is part of the CHA’s Plan for Transformation. The Rebuild
Foundation, whose mission includes providing arts programming for children, plans to provide
programming in the arts center, coordinating artists living on-site who will be required to
volunteer a minimum of five hours per week. This project will also be part of a larger network
of artists’ residences being established by the Foundation in six midwestern cities.

These vacant CHA apartments at 70th Street and Harper Avenue in the 5th Ward are among 32 two- and
three-bedroom units slated for redevelopment as artists’ residences.

 PROMOTION AND SUPPORT OF
HOMEOWNERSHIP
At the start of 2012, the Department projected commitments of over $62 million to help
almost 700 households achieve or sustain homeownership.
For the full year, HED committed over $62 million in resources to support 443 units.
These numbers represent 67% of the annual homeownership unit goal and 101% of the
homeownership resource allocation goal.

Troubled Building Condo Initiative to Continue
As Self-Funded Program
Building on the success of the TBI Multi-Family and Single-Family programs, the TBI
Condo program was initiated by HED in response to the mounting numbers of vacant
and dysfunctional condo buildings in Chicago during the mid-2000s. A combination of
unscrupulous developers and lax lending standards had caused a surge of foreclosures and
vacancies rippling through many converted condo buildings, while a tangle of ownership
issues deterred the sale and rehab of individual units. Using a three-year, $2.5 million federal
grant under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), HED contracted with
Community Initiatives, Inc. (CII) to acquire, assemble, manage, and sell these vacant units.
The program began in 2009 with the selection
of twelve condo buildings housing a total
of 80 vacant units. In 2010, several units
were acquired at lower than anticipated costs
through donations from banks or by court
order as a result of Illinois’s newly enacted
Distressed Condominium Act. These factors
enabled HED to expand the program and add
more buildings to the acquisition list. By the
end of the ARRA grant period in September
2012, 188 units had been acquired–more
than twice as many as originally projected.

This three-story building at 3550 W. Franklin in
the 27th Ward is being rehabbed under the TBI
Condo program.

HED’s intent is to continue operating the program supported exclusively by revenues
generated as buildings are sold. The program is now targeting twenty buildings containing
252 units in the communities of Albany Park, Avondale, Chatham, Chicago Lawn, Humboldt
Park, Logan Square, Rogers Park, Washington Park, West Ridge and Woodlawn. The first
five buildings have been sold, generating income of almost $360,000. In 2013 HED will
continue to partner with CII in identifying additional troubled condo buildings to bring into
the program, supported by anticipated program income of $1,025,000.

 IMPROVEMENT AND PRESERVATION
OF HOMES
At the start of 2012, the Department projected commitments of almost $15 million to help
2,000 households repair, modify or improve their homes.
For the full year, HE9 units.
These numbers represent 98% of the annual home improvement and preservation unit goal
and 77% of the resource allocation goal.

Homeownership Counseling to be Expanded
Under New IHDA Grant in 2013
HED’s direct support for homeownership counseling programs will be significantly boosted
in 2013 through a new $960,000 annual grant from the Illinois Housing Development
Authority (IHDA). The new grant, which more than doubles City counseling assistance
from $445,000 in previous years, will enable the Department to expand the number of Cityfunded agencies under the Homeownership Counseling Services (HCS) program from nine
to thirteen.
Through HCS, HUD-certified Housing Counseling Agencies provide foreclosure prevention
and homebuyer counseling services to current and prospective homeowners. The thirteen
agencies were selected through an RFP issued in November 2012.

EHAP Enhancements Approved for 2013
In December 2012, legislation was introduced to expand the Emergency Housing Assistance
Program (EHAP) by raising the income eligibility ceiling from 50% to 80% of AMI. Under
the change, approved by the City Council in January 2013, the maximum qualifying income
is now $58,900 for a family of four. This is the first such expansion of EHAP since its
inception in 1984.
Also, the Department revamped the intake process for EHAP to make it fairer and more
convenient for applicants. For the first time in 2013, open enrollment for the Roof and Porch
Repair/Replacement Program was rescheduled from the New Year's Day holiday to the
first business day of the year. During the new enrollment period, which ran from 9 a.m.
to 3 p.m. on January 2 through January 4, more than 2,500 interested residents called into
the City’s 311 Service Center to place their names on the list for roof or porch repairs.

 POLICY, LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS
AND OTHER ISSUES
Micro Market Recovery Program Update
The Micro Market Recovery Program (MMRP) was launched in August 2011 to combat
high foreclosure rates and stabilize property values in targeted neighborhoods throughout the
city. Through the program the City works to foster the reoccupation of vacant or foreclosed
properties in nine target areas (see map on p. 8) by coordinating multiple incentive programs,
not-for-profit intermediaries and for-profit capital sources, and by providing financing to
approved developers and end-users.
Since its inception, MMRP has leveraged the resources of the City and its non-profit and
community partners to assist over 1,700 units in more than 260 properties. Combined public
and private investments in MMRP properties now total $236.9 million, including $142.4
million through the City’s affordable housing programs. This funding supports a wide range
of services, including: foreclosure counseling; home repair assistance; enforcement, stabilization
and repair of distressed properties; and private financing for acquisition and rehab.
Key to this effort in each target area is the City’s Community Partner--an organization that
is taking the lead in identifying local solutions to the foreclosure crisis. Each Community
Partner assumes responsibility for a wide range of activities: surveying and reporting vacant
properties in their community; providing or facilitating foreclosure counseling, financial
literacy and credit counseling; assistance with insurance and property tax reduction options;
referrals for lending and homeowner counseling to prospective buyers; block clean-ups and
organizing; and other community engagement activities that help keep existing residents in
their homes and avoid further foreclosures and vacancies. The groups meet monthly to review
overall strategies, share best practices and get updates on the status of vacant properties.

The City continues on track to meet HUD’s upcoming deadlines for the expenditure of NSP
dollars. The first deadline requires all NSP2 funds to be spent by February 11, 2013; the final
date for NSP1 is March 27, 2013. Property acquisitions under NSP3 will continue during
2013; the deadline for drawdown of these funds is March 15, 2014.
Through the end of 2012, a total of 826 units in 173 properties have been acquired (or are
under contract to buy) using funds from Chicago’s three NSP grants. Rehab construction has
started on 667 units in 134 properties; 458 units (92 properties) have been finished or are
nearing completion. Sixty-six units (42 properties) have been sold to qualified homebuyers,
and several multifamily properties are partially occupied and in the lease-up process. A list of
all properties that have been assisted through NSP can be found in the Appendix. An updated
version of this list is always available at www.chicagonsp.org.

This blighted commercial building at 436 E. 47th Street
in the 3rd Ward will soon be reborn as Bronzeville Artist
Lofts with the assistance of $4.4 million in NSP2 grant funds.

NOTE: Gross rent limits for 50% and 65% AMI, the High HOME Rent, and the Fair Market Rent are published by HUD. All other rent limits are calculated assuming 1.5 occupants per bedroom and 1 occupant for an apartment with no
bedrooms.
* For HOME-funded developments, rents are the "lesser of" the Fair Market Rent for the unit size or the High HOME Rent for the unit size. In HOME-funded developments with 5 or more units, 20% of the HOME-assisted units must be
occupied by very-low income families whose rents do not exceed 30% of the annual income of a family whose income equals 50% of the area median. This is known as the "Low HOME Rent."
