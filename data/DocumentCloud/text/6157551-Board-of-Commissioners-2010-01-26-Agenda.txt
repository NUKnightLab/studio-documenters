JOAN PATRICIA MURPHY, County Commissioner
Co-Sponsored by
EARLEAN COLLINS and PETER N. SILVESTRI, County Commissioners
A RESOLUTION CALLING FOR THE COMPLETION OF AN ECONOMIC
IMPACT STUDY AND CONSIDERATION OF THE CONFERENCES OF GOVERNMENT
COMMENT BEFORE ADOPTION OF THE COOK COUNTY WATERSHED MANAGEMENT
ORDINANCE
WHEREAS, the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago (MWRD) assumed
authority for general supervision of stormwater management in Cook County pursuant to the passage of
Public Act 93-1049 (Act) by the Illinois State Legislature on November 17, 2004. The MWRD’s Board
of Commissioners adopted the Cook County Stormwater Management Plan (CCSMP) by ordinance on
February 15, 2007, as required per the Act as a first step in establishing the MWRD’s countywide
stormwater management program and the development of a stormwater management regulatory
ordinance; and
WHEREAS, the MWRD has proposed a Watershed Management Ordinance (WMO) which is intended
to protect Cook County citizens from increases in flooding, protect the county’s natural resources, and to
preserve and enhance water quality by fostering responsible development addressing stormwater
management; and
WHEREAS, our local governments are charged with planning for the future sustainability of the
community. Therefore, while the importance of proper storm water management is inherent, the
responsibility of local elected officials includes the protection of their residents and the protection of
opportunities for future economic development and redevelopment. Healthy, livable communities are
built and maintained with sustainable development activities which must include not only environmental
protection and enhancement but economic development and social benefits as well; and

COMMISSIONERS continued
RESOLUTION continued
ITEM #5 cont’d
WHEREAS, while the draft Watershed Management Ordinance addresses the environmental benefits, it
in no way addresses the economic or social impacts it mandates. The WMO as written could have
disastrous effects on suburban Cook County communities, especially those more disadvantaged than
others, where redevelopment is already stymied and for those communities that have little vacant land
available and redevelopment is their only hope of economic stimulus. The expertise of entities with
proven natural resource management capabilities and responsibilities, such as our municipalities and
watershed management organizations, must be utilized in the revision of the WMO; and
WHEREAS, it is imperative that the concerns of the Conferences of Governments (COGs) which include
the Southwest Municipal Conference (SMC), the South Suburban Mayors and Managers Association
(SSMMA), the Northwest Municipal Conference (NWMC), and the West Central Municipal Conference
(WCMC) be wholly addressed by the MWRD before the WMO is adopted. The following are the
recommendations and comments on the draft WMO shared by the COGs and the six Cook County
watershed planning councils: Lower Des Plaines, Poplar Creek, Upper Salt Creek, Little Calumet River,
Cal-Sag Channel, and the North Branch of the Chicago River.
1.

An economic impact study of the Watershed Management Ordinance should be
conducted.

2.

Review and permit authority should be delegated to qualified and willing municipalities.

3.

Establish permit review time benchmarks.

4.

Reexamine technical provisions of the draft WMO.

5.

Clearly delineate the responsibilities of co-applicants and examine the implications of the
WMO on them.

6.

Provide dual or multi-county municipalities with the option to adopt one ordinance.

7.

Revise and complete the Technical Guidance Manual to provide guidance on the
implementation of and compliance with the Watershed Management Ordinance.

8.

Include provisions that allow for a fee in lieu of detention.

9.

Provide a draft fee schedule for public review.

10.

Reexamine the absolute prohibition on stormwater detention facilities in the floodway.

11.

Revisit the definition of exempt projects related to “grandfathering” and local flood
control projects.

12.

Refrain from publishing or regulating by Detailed Watershed Plan (DWP) Inundation
Maps unless the District establishes administrative procedures and the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) adopts the information contained therein as
Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMS); and

COMMISSIONERS continued
RESOLUTION continued
ITEM #5 cont’d
WHEREAS, the sustainability of our communities mandates consideration of the economic effects of the
Cook County Watershed Management Ordinance as proposed. Cook County cannot have an ordinance
that pushes even more development to surrounding counties with better taxing structures. An economic
impact study that captures the benefits and costs of the Ordinance is necessary before the WMO is
adopted.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County does
hereby call upon the President and Commissioners of the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of
Greater Chicago to seriously consider the concerns of our local governments and conduct an economic
impact study before the Cook County Watershed Management Ordinance is adopted; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a suitable copy of this Resolution be tendered to the President and
Board of the MWRD and let it also be spread upon the official proceedings of this Honorable Body.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
FLEET MANAGEMENT PROGRAM
WHEREAS, Cook County has a fleet of approximately 2000 vehicles; and
WHEREAS, the implementation of a fleet management program using a car-sharing approach to county
vehicles on a cross-departmental basis could increase the efficiency of the county fleet, offering potential
cost-savings and decreasing the environmental impact of county vehicle usage; and
WHEREAS, there is technology and equipment available to manage public sector fleets, providing realtime data, including: vehicle demand, usage, reservations, drivers and maintenance; and
WHEREAS, this information can be used to help maximize fleet performance and achieve an average of
20 to 40 percent reduction in total vehicles; and

ITEM #6 cont’d
WHEREAS, the District of Columbia began a 6-month pilot program in a fleet management program in
October of 2009 with the goal of eliminating 150 vehicles from the city’s motor fleet; and
WHEREAS, at the end of the six-month pilot program, the District reduced the number of cars in its
passenger car fleet by 360 vehicles—17% of the original fleet—to yield an estimated savings of $6.6
million over five years; and
WHEREAS, following the pilot program, the District of Columbia continued with their new management
program, under which the District currently operates at a ratio of 15:1 drivers to vehicles, while most
counties and cities operate at driver ratios between 2:1 and 5:1 per vehicle; and
WHEREAS, combined with the District’s fleet reduction, the new fleet management program yields an
estimated reduction of 800-900 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions; and
WHEREAS, fleet management technology can also provide extensive reporting capabilities which can
identify safety risks and help ensure vehicle policies are followed by tracking the location and driver of
County vehicles at all times.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners requests
that the Bureau of Administration explore the use of an electronic fleet management system to manage
Cook County vehicles, where appropriate; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Bureau of Administration report back to the Cook County
Board of Commissioners to present their findings at their earliest possible convenience.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
CONSOLIDATION OF COOK COUNTY’S TECHNOLOGY
WHEREAS, Cook County has struggled for years to seek out the best approach to address the
technology requirements of all entities under the auspices of the County; and
WHEREAS, there has been resistance among some elected officials to consolidate into the County’s
main technology system due to concerns with privacy; and
WHEREAS, it has become evident that the County cannot continue financially to fund separate or
proprietary technology plans for different agencies and departments under the umbrella of the County;
and
WHEREAS, technology funding outside of the Bureau of Technology is significant: automation funding
is $30 million with 240 FTE’s; document storage costs are $26 million with 192 FTE’s; and technology
related to the 260 and 579 accounts is over $50 million annually; and
WHEREAS, it is clear that consolidation across all areas of technology will improve efficiencies and
save the County money, in 2010 the Bureau of Technology will save $700,000 by consolidating the
iSeries system into the mainframe and $450,000 by transitioning phone system maintenance to existing
staff; and
WHEREAS, of paramount importance in the consolidation process are privacy issues for independent
elected officials, and ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of important information. The Bureau of
Technology has already proven this can be accomplished as has been done in Maricopa, Los Angeles and
Miami Dade Counties in their IT consolidation programs; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board previously approved the consolidated approach to hardware,
software and technology related services, the County must now take the next step to consolidate all
technology investments, systems and applications.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Bureau of Technology will prepare to centralize
technology throughout the County by: preparing an Enterprise Architectural Plan for all County IT
operations; consolidate all IT spending including oversight of special purpose funds; continue to build a
disaster recovery site; convert historical paper records to electronic format along with other necessary
steps and present it to the President and Board of Commissioners prior to the 2011 budget process for
implementation into the 2011 budget.; and

Reason:

A regional Request for Proposal (RFP) was jointly developed by Cook, DuPage, Kane,
Kendall, Lake, McHenry and Will counties for the selection of a company to perform aerial
imagery for data acquisition and sharing at county borders. After the completion of the RFP
process, the regional GIS workgroup has recommended Merrick & Company based on its
ability to meet all technical specifications of the RFP.
Since Cook County has the largest, most complex territory in the region composing of dense
urban areas, airports and shore line environments, it is acting as the lead government project
manager for this initiative. Agencies which are able to contribute financially to this project
are Cook, DuPage, Kane, Kendall and Lake counties, the Metropolitan Agency for Planning
and the United States Geological Survey. Cook County beneficiaries of this project will be
Cook County municipalities which provide vital operations involving first responders,
emergency planners, remediation experts for homeland security, emergency management and
disaster preparedness.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $3,917,540.39 (FY2010 - $1,248,358.48; FY2011 - $1,304,492.88; and FY2012
- $1,364,689.03). Contract period: March 1, 2010 through February 28, 2013. (545-260 Account).

BRUCE WASHINGTON, Director, Office of Capital Planning and Policy
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to advertise for bids for the construction of the new
Residential Treatment Unit (RTU) - Reception Classification Diagnostic Center (RCDC) Building at the
Department of Corrections.
This project will provide a new facility to combine and house the Reception Classification Diagnostic
Center which processes admissions into the Department of Corrections (DOC), Cermak Health Services
of Cook County and the Residential Treatment Unit. The program includes new intake, holding, and
processing areas, clinics, medical services and associated administrative functions, dormitories and
auxiliary dormitory functions. In recent years, this system has had to respond to the demands of
increasing numbers of inmate admissions and mental health evaluations and treatment. The existing
RCDC and RTU facilities can no longer accommodate the volume of admissions, screenings and care
required. The facilities are overcrowded, basic amenities are inadequate, building systems are outdated
and in some cases non-functional.
The new facility will meet current ‘Essential Standards” set by the National Commission on Correctional
Health Care and the American Correctional Association and is required for maintaining accreditation and
will provide for an efficient and orderly intake process including, screening and provision of care.

CONTRACT
ITEM #34
APPROVED AS AMENDED
Transmitting a Communication, dated December 28, 2009 from
JAMES M. HOULIHAN, Cook County Assessor
by
JOHN M. FALLON, Special Assistant to the Assessor
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with Cook County Suburban
Publishers, Inc., Chicago, Illinois, for publication of the state mandated publications, as follows: proposed
assessed values for the 2010 real estate triennial assessment of the North Townships outside the city of
Chicago; revisions made to the 2010 triennial assessment in North Townships outside the city of Chicago,
after publication of the initial triennial assessment publication; 2010 triennial assessment list in additional
newspapers for additional public notification as directed by the Assessor's office; revisions made to the
2010 real estate non-triennial assessment of South Townships outside the city of Chicago; and revisions
made as a consequence of the change in assessment practices to the 2009 real estate assessment of North
and South townships outside the city of Chicago.
Reason:

Cook County Suburban Publishers, Inc. has been the sole-source vendor for the publication of

Suburban Publishers, Inc. was the only vendor to submit a response when the annual contract
was sent out to bid. State statutes (35ILCS 200/12-20 and 715 ILCS 10/1 et seq.) impose
strict guidelines as to who may publish the assessment list for Cook County's suburban
townships. Therefore, due to the timely nature of publishing the assessment list, the
Assessor's Office requests that this contract be sole-sourced to Cook County Suburban
Publishers, Inc.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $1,041,992.80. Contract period: May 1, 2010 through April 30 2011. (040240 Account). Requisition No. 00400008.
