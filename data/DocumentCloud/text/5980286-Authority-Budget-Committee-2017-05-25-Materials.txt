1. Minutes of the November 17, 2016, Budget Committee Meeting
Motion: Ms. Wolff moved to approve the minutes of the November 17, 2016, Budget
Committee Meeting. Ms. Paziotopoulos seconded the motion.
Ms. Wolff said Page 4 of the minutes indicated Ms. Hora had abstained from the motion
to approve recommended FFY15 Victim Assistance Discretionary Grant Training funds
to the Illinois Attorney General’s Office and that Page 5 of the minutes indicated Ms.
Greene had abstained from the motion to approve recommended FFY13, FFY15, and
FFY16 Violence Against Women Act funds that included recommended designations to
the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office and, in both instances, the term recused
should have been used in place of abstained to indicate that the decision not to vote was
based on potential conflicts of interest and not for any other reason.
The motion, including the amendments requested by Ms. Wolff described above, passed
by unanimous voice vote.

 2. Justice Assistance Grant Matching Funds Policy Discussion & Vote
Executive Director John Maki called attention to a memo dated February 24, 2017,
regarding a recommendation to no longer require matching funds from JAG program
grantees.
Authority General Counsel Weis described the Authority’s existing JAG match policy.
She said that the policy has many inconsistencies and she said that the federal
government does not require matching funds for JAG grants. She said the newly
established competitive grant process would effectively ensure the local buy-in that
matching funds were intended to encourage and, therefore, matching funds would no
longer be necessary. The elimination of matching funds would apply to all future
designations.
Motion: Ms. Wolff moved to approve the recommended elimination of the matching
funds requirement for JAG grants. Ms. Smith seconded the motion and the motion passed
by unanimous voice vote.
3.A. Justice Assistance Grant Designation Reductions
Associate Director Givens called attention to a memo dated February 24, 2017, regarding
FFY12 and FFY13 JAG Plan Adjustments. He called attention to the table in the memo
describing returned FFY12 and FFY13 funds and the staff recommendation to make
those funds available for reprogramming.
Motion: Ms. Wolff moved to approve the recommended FFY12 and FFY13 JAG
designation reductions. Ms. Paziotopoulos seconded the motion and the motion passed by
unanimous voice vote.
3.B. Justice Assistance Grants: Recommended Designations
Associate Director Givens called attention to a memo dated February 24, 2017, regarding
FFY14 JAG Plan Adjustments. He described a recommended designation of $98,862 in
FFY14 funds to St. Clair County pursuant to a solicitation of applications for funding to
support Illinois Partnerships to Reduce Violent Crime programs.
Motion: Ms. Paziotopoulos moved to approve the recommended FFY14 JAG
designation. Ms. Wolff seconded the motion and the motion passed by unanimous voice
vote.

 Associate Director Givens described a recommended designation of $331,569 in FFY14
funds to the Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC) to support substance abuse
treatment programming at an adult transition center.
Rick Krause, representing IDOC, said the funds would support treatment at a 50-bed
treatment center in conjunction with a work-release program.
Motion: Ms. Campanelli moved to approve the recommended FFY14 JAG designation
recommendation. Ms. Paziotopoulos seconded the motion and the motion passed by
unanimous voice vote.
3.C. Justice Assistance Grant Notices of Funding Opportunity
Associate Director Givens called attention to a memo dated February 24, 2017, regarding
JAG notices of funding opportunity. He called attention to a table on Page 1 of the memo
describing the planned release schedule. The schedule included:




A funding opportunity for Comprehensive Law Enforcement Responses to
Narcotics programming using $4.2 million in available FFY14, FFY15, and
FFY16 JAG funds. This initiative would support police-led diversion/deflection,
multi-jurisdictional large-scale narcotics trafficking enforcement, and multijurisdictional narcotics prosecution units.
A sole-source funding opportunity using $946,000 in available JAG funds to
support the Authority’s Research and Evaluation work.

A general discussion ensued regarding the merits of the proposed programming.
JAG Program Supervisor Greg Stevens said that the notices of funding opportunity would
be designed to maximize the use of available funds among the three recommended
programming areas:




Narcotics Enforcement.
Narcotics Prosecution.
Law Enforcement Diversion and Deflection.

Mr. Delfino said that a primary responsibility, with regard to the new competitive
awarding structure, is to ensure a degree of equity in allocating resources among law
enforcement, defense, and prosecution, as any significant imbalances would create their
own problems.

4. National Forensic Sciences Improvement Act
Associate Director Givens called attention to a memo dated February 24, 2017, regarding
FFY15 National Forensic Sciences Improvement Act Plan Adjustments. He called
attention to the table in the memo describing FFY15 funds recently returned to the

FFY14, FFY15, and FFY16 local-use funds that would be used to augment the funding
initiative.
Motion: Ms. Wolff moved to approve the recommended RSAT notice of funding
opportunity plan to use FFY14, FFY15, and FFY16 local-use funds and anticipated

voice vote.

MEMORANDUM
TO:

Budget Committee Members

FROM:

Kevin Givens, Associate Director, Federal & State Grants Unit

Date:

May 25, 2017

RE:

Federal Fiscal Year 2013 Justice Assistance Grants Plan Adjustment
Federal Fiscal Year 2014 Justice Assistance Grants Plan Adjustment
Federal Fiscal Year 2015 Justice Assistance Grants Plan Adjustment

Fund Reallocations
At the May 12, 2016, Budget Committee meeting, the Budget Committee set aside $1
million in FFY13 and FFY15 Justice Assistance Grant funding to support Information
Sharing Environment Coordination Investment Partnerships. Staff recommends
rescinding the funds from that set-aside because spending plans never materialized. Staff
recommends making the $453,781 in FFY13 funds and $546,219 in FFY15 funds
available for future reprogramming.
Recommended Designation
Staff recommends designating the $285,120 in FFY14 funds to the Illinois Department of
Corrections (IDOC) to support its Community-Based Residential Treatment for Female
Offenders Females in Transition (FIT) program.
In the FIT program, a team of state employees, contractual caseworkers, and local service
providers work to meet this population’s needs to help overcome barriers to re-entry.
Participants receive supportive services in the areas of affordable housing, treatment,
health care, childcare, legitimate income, and other areas, as needed.
The program strategy is to provide individualized support services, rather than funding a
pre-packaged or general program. Gender-responsive case management services are
available to program participants. Services provide a continuum of programming from
pre-release services in the facility through post-release programming in the community,
linking women to available service networks and community-based programs.
Staff will be at the Budget Committee meeting to answer any questions.

BUDGET COMMITTEE GRANT RECOMMENDATION REPORT
Program Name:

Community-Based Residential Treatment for Female Offenders Females in Transition

Program – Illinois Department of Corrections
Funding Source:

Federal Fiscal Year 2014 Justice Assistance Grant: $285,120; No Match

Program Description
The need for the community-based residential treatment for female offenders was identified at the Authority’s
2000 statewide planning summit. The program was first funded with Edward Byrne Memorial Anti-Drug Abuse
Act (ADAA) fund. The program has since been supported with Justice Assistance Grants.
Program Activities
Women returning to the community from prison face unique challenges. Many have significant histories of
victimization and substance abuse and have been separated from their children for lengthy periods. To increase
each woman’s chances for successful transition, specific needs are addressed before, during, and after release.
In the Females in Transition (FIT) program, a team of state employees, contractual caseworkers, and local
service providers work to meet this population’s needs to help overcome barriers to re-entry. Participants
receive supportive services in the areas of affordable housing, treatment, health care, childcare, legitimate
income, and other areas, as needed.
The program strategy is to provide individualized support services, rather than funding a pre-packaged or
general program. Gender-responsive case management services are available to program participants. Services
provide a continuum of programming from pre-release services in the facility through post-release
programming in the community, linking women to available service networks and community-based programs.
Priorities
This program addresses the corrections priority “to provide resources both to enhance the safety of correctional
facilities, victims and the public by supporting research informed or promising behavioral change
programming informed by proven risk assessment and also to service offenders with mental illness,
developmental disabilities and substance use disorders in order to reduce reoffending, with an emphasis on
programming that allows offenders to safely remain in their communities and to pay restitution to victims of
their crimes.”
Performance Assessment
The program continues to provide services to a large number of women on during both pre- and post-release
components of the program. Quarterly reporting is accurate and timely.

BUDGET COMMITTEE GRANT RECOMMENDATION REPORT
Program Name:

Chicago Survivors of Homicide Victims

Funding Source:

SFY18 Death Penalty Abolition Fund: $1,346,943

Program Description
Chicago Citizens for Change, doing business as Chicago Survivors, has been providing crisis response and
recovery services to family members of Chicago homicide victims since 2014. The program was initially funded
through a federal discretionary grant to the City of Chicago. The City of Chicago passed the funds through to
Thresholds, which subcontracted with Chicago Survivors for program implementation while providing fiscal
management and capacity building support. The Authority began supporting the program with Death Penalty
Abolition (DPA) funds at the expiration of the federal discretionary award in February 2017.
This project has been successful, serving all Chicago Police Districts since September 2015. Under a joint
protocol, the Chicago Police Department relies on Chicago Survivors to respond to homicide within four hours of
notification. Average response times are approximately one hour. During February and March 2017, the program
responded to 80 homicide notifications, providing liaisons with the police for 79 families, accompaniment to the
medical examiner’s office for 21 families, and services to 22 families with minors in crisis. During this period, 73
families signed service agreements for ongoing case management services. Family support specialists performed
16 assessments of daily functioning and PTSD after five months of case management services, eight of which
indicated a reduction of PTSD symptoms and an increase in daily functioning.
Public Act 725 ILCS 5/119(b) directed the transfer of all unobligated and unexpended monies remaining in the
Capital Litigation Trust Fund to the Death Penalty Abolition Fund, a special fund in the state treasury, to be
expended by the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority. The recommended designation will support
continued operation of this program from July 1, 2017, to June 30, 2018, and is contingent upon state
appropriation of DPA funds.
Chicago Survivor’s programmatic risk assessment indicates that it has developed sufficient administrative
capacity to receive and manage grant funds without assistance from Thresholds. A sole source notice of funding
opportunity identifying Chicago Citizens for Change as the only eligible applicant will be posted.
Program Activities
Through this funding opportunity, Chicago Survivors will provide crisis response services, including provision of
immediate, on-site crisis responders to assist with de-escalation of retaliatory action or suicidal responses, and
needs such as temporary relocation, emergency childcare, crime scene clean-up, assistance with victims’
compensation, and assistance dealing with media, police, and medical examiners.
In addition, Chicago Survivors will provide recovery support, including a “warm transfer” from the crisis
responder to a family support specialist who will provide ongoing, regular case management, funeral planning
assistance, accompaniment to court proceedings, and linkage to other support services, including mental health
care. Chicago Survivors will provide individual support to each survivor family.

13

 DPA SFY18
May 25, 2017

 
Chicago Survivors will conduct hands-on training to ensure the protocol is clear to all first responders such as
police, emergency medical personnel, medical examiners, hospital trauma center staff, and other pertinent entities,
such as prosecutors, school staff, and community-based social service providers. Trainings are designed to
promote a trauma-informed approach and provide insight on how to appropriately respond to victims
experiencing trauma and complicated grief.
In addition, Chicago Survivors provides systems advocacy, working with entities such as the Association of
Funeral Home Directors and the Attorney General’s office to address potential unfair practices, and other barriers
survivor families face following homicides.
Priorities
Public Act 725 ILCS 5/119(b) states the Death Penalty Abolition Fund shall be used for services for families of
victims of homicide or murder, and for training of law enforcement personnel.
Funding Prospectus
Ongoing funding is dependent on future appropriation by the General Assembly.

Program Assistant; 4 Crisis Responders; 7 Community Support Specialists; Community of
Survivors Manager; Community of Survivors Specialist; Youth Program Manager; 2 Youth

Description
NARIP provides assistance to states to improve the 
completeness, automation, and transmittal of records to 
state and federal systems used to conduct background 
checks. Such records include criminal history records, 
records of felony convictions, warrants, records 
of protective orders, convictions for misdemeanors 
involving domestic violence and stalking, records of mental 
health adjudications, and others that may disqualify an 
individual from possessing or receiving a firearm under 
federal law. Helping states to automate these records also 
reduces delays for law‐abiding gun purchasers.

3. RECOMMENDED DESIGNATIONS TO LEAD ENTITIES
On January 10 and 11, 2017, ICJIA convened the VSAHC to review past priorities and define
new ones for the use of VOCA funds. The VSAHC prioritized strengthening and expansion of
core services.
Funding of core services will be processed through a lead entity policy that established by ICJIA
in January 2017. This policy states that lead entities can be used to distribute funds to subgrantees to implement federal- and state-supported programs. When a lead entity is identified by
ICJIA, the entity is responsible for the fiscal oversight and quality assurance of its sub-grants.
Lead entities conduct structured monitoring and provide subject matter expertise and technical
assistance to sub-grantees. The Authority monitors its grant to a lead entity through periodic
progress reports.
The following designations for three lead entity programs are consistent with the priorities set
forth by the Victim Service Ad Hoc Committee.
A. Services to Victims of Domestic Violence
Illinois Coalition Against Domestic Violence (ICADV): ICADV is a statewide network of
service providers that provides direct services to victims to alleviate trauma and suffering
resulting from domestic violence. The program provides counseling, advocacy, outreach
services, training, and other support to victims of domestic violence in general and to child
victims of domestic violence. Staff recommends designating $17,300,000 in FFY15 funds to
ICADV. Please see the attached Grant Recommendation Report for more information.

B. Services to Victims of Sexual Assault
Illinois Coalition Against Sexual Assault (ICASA): ICASA is a statewide network of service
providers that provides direct services to victims to alleviate trauma and suffering resulting
from sexual assault. The program provides counseling, advocacy, outreach services, training,
and other support services to victims of sexual assault in general and to underserved sexual
assault victim populations. Staff recommends designating $16,300,000 in FFY15 funds to
ICASA. Please see the attached Grant Recommendation Report for more information.
C. Child Advocacy Center Services
Children’s Advocacy Centers of Illinois (CACI): CACI is a statewide association of child
advocacy centers that provides direct services to child victims to alleviate trauma and
suffering resulting from child abuse. Staff recommends designating $7.1 million in FFY16
funds to the Child Advocacy Centers of Illinois. Please see the attached Grant
Recommendation Report for more information.

Note - Assuming the Budget Committee approval of all recommendations described in this
memo, there will only be $6,846 (or approximately 0.008.8 percent of the original award to the
Authority) remaining undesignated out of the $77,586,941 FFY15 award.

Staff will be available at the meeting to answer any questions.

BUDGET COMMITTEE GRANT RECOMMENDATION REPORT
Program Name:

Comprehensive Legal Assistance Services

Funding Source:

Federal Fiscal Years 2015 and 1016 Victim of Crime Act: Amount, Match Amount
(if necessary)

Request Type:

Notice of State Award

Program Description
These recommended designations are intended to fund comprehensive legal assistance for victims of crime.
Legal assistance services must be reasonable and the need for such services must arise as a direct result of the
client’s victimization. These legal assistance services will serve at least one of the following victim populations:
victims of domestic violence; elder abuse; financial exploitation; human trafficking; and sexual violence.
Program Activities
These designations will support at least one of three types of legal assistance: emergency legal assistance;
victims’ rights enforcement; and civil legal assistance. Within each category there are specific types of legal
action.
Emergency Legal Assistance
● Filing for emergency restraining or protective orders
● Obtaining emergency custody orders and visitation rights
Victims’ Rights Enforcement
● Assisting victims in asserting their rights as victims or otherwise protecting their safety, privacy, or
other interests as victims, in a criminal proceeding directly related to the victimization
Civil Legal Assistance
● Proceedings for protective/restraining orders or campus administrative protection/stay-away orders
● Family, custody, support, or dependency matters
● Contract, housing, or employment matters
● Immigration assistance
● Intervention with creditors, law enforcement (e.g., to obtain police reports), and other entities
● Intervention with administrative agencies, schools/colleges, or tribal entities and other circumstances
where legal advice or intervention would assist in addressing the consequences of a person's
victimization
● Filing a motion to vacate or expunge a victim’s conviction, or similar action, based on his/her status of
being a victim, where permitted under Illinois law

23

 VOCA FFY15 and FFY16
May 25, 2017

Goals
The goal is to provide victims comprehensive legal assistance services. Applicants were required to project the
number of clients they plan to reach with each type of legal assistance proposed. Selected grantees will be
required to report on these measures.
Priorities
ICJIA’s statewide victim needs assessment identified a need for legal services during the crisis (0-3 months),
intermediate (3-6 months), and long-term (6-12 months) post-victimization phases. Of the victim service
providers who participated in ICJIA’s assessment, nearly one-third (32.5 percent) cited criminal justice
advocacy as a crisis need and nearly one in five (18.4 percent) identified civil legal assistance as a need during
that same phase. As victims transition to the intermediate phase, many victims still need criminal justice
advocacy (24.4 percent) and civil legal assistance. Even in the long-term post-victimization phase, a substantial
number of victims need criminal justice advocacy services (20.9 percent) or civil legal assistance (10.7 percent).
Funding Prospectus
Based on program performance and fund availability, ICJIA may recommend at a future date that any or all of
the programs listed below be designated funding to support an additional 24 months.
