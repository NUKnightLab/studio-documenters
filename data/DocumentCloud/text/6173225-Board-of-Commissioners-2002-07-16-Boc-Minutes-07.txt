There being a quorum present, the meeting duly convened and business was transacted as follows:
Chairperson Gilliam then introduced to the general public Ms. Lori Healey, the newly appointed
Commissioner. Per Chairperson Gilliam, on Wednesday, July 10th, Ms. Healey, was approved by
the City Council as Commissioner and Vice-Chair of the CHA’s Board of Commissioners. Ms.
Healey acts as the Managing Principal for architectural projects at Perkins & Will, a prominent
Chicago architecture and design firm. Prior to joining Perkins & Will, Ms. Healey served as the
First Deputy Commissioner of the City of Chicago’s Department of Planning and Development.
Ms. Healey has over 19 years of experience in real estate and economic development for private
and public enterprise. She has previously held the position of Executive Director of the Federation
of Women Contractors, Deputy Director of the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community
Affairs, and Special Assistant to former Kansas Governor, John Carlin. Ms. Healey serves on the
Board of Directors of the Chicago land Chamber of Commerce, Chicago Women in Government
Relations and the Women’s Business Development Center, to name but a few. Ms. Healey was a
founding member of the Illinois Executive Women in State Government and served as a board
member of the Illinois Development Finance Authority. Ms. Healey was welcomed with warm
applause from the audience.
Commissioner Healey graciously acknowledged the audience and indicated that she was looking
forward to working with fellow Commissioners, residents of the CHA, Terry Peterson and his
quality staff, many of whom she had had the opportunity to work with before. Per Commissioner
Healey, she looks forward to serving the City and residents of CHA to the best of her ability.
The Chairperson then announced that this meeting marks the second anniversary of Terry
Peterson’s second anniversary as Chief Executive Officer of the CHA. Mr. Peterson took the reins
one year after the Authority was returned to local control from its nearly five years of management
1

 by HUD. Mr. Peterson was charged with carrying out the “Plan For Transformation” which
provides for the redevelopment or rehabilitation of 25,000 dwelling units housing 135,000
residents. The $1.5 billion plan calls for the creation of 10 new mixed income communities, the
rehabilitation of 14 family developments, the rehabilitation of 9,500 senior units in 58 buildings
and the demolition of 22,000 units in 53 high rise buildings. To date, Terry has successfully
completed a number of major initiatives including: the privatization of all property management;
the transfer of education, social services and recreation programs to the appropriate city agencies
or departments; the implementation of the Service Connector System to link residents with
supportive services; the issuance of double A rated Capital Program Revenue Bonds backed by
HUD appropriations, the first ever such debt instrument in the nation.
On behalf of the Board of Commissioners, residents and staff, the Chairperson thanked Mr.
Peterson for his outstanding leadership and commitment.
The Chairperson then announced that the Chief Executive Officer would now be presenting his
monthly report at the beginning of the meeting rather than at the end of public commentary
session.
Per Mr. Peterson, the agenda to be presented for approval at today’s meeting requests a total of $63
million in rehab construction activity all designed under the Plan For Transformation. With the
sheer volume of activity, the Capital Program is pushing ahead on all fronts, both to improve the
quality of life for residents and to have a positive long-term impact on the communities. Mr.
Peterson continued by indicating that the management’s intention is to make the transition for
CHA children and families as secure and comfortable as possible. Each quarter, per Mr. Peterson,
staff is getting better at helping residents find new homes and adjust to new communities. Mr.
Peterson concluded his report by saluting the CHA Board, residents and staff for their efforts in
moving forward and continuously progressing in achieving the goals of the Plan For
Transformation.
The Chairperson then convened the Public Hearing portion of the meeting by inviting residents and
the public at large to address the Board.
Immediately following the Public Hearing portion of the meeting, a Motion was introduced and
seconded to adjourn to Executive Session. The Chairperson announced that pursuant to the Open
Meetings Act, 5 ILCS 120/2, the Board would adjourn for approximately one (1) hour to discuss
pending, probable or imminent litigation, collective negotiating matters, security and personnel
matters.

2002.
Commissioner Davis then introduced an Omnibus Motion for the adoption of Resolutions for
Items A1 through A5 discussed, voted and recommended for Board approval by the Finance and
Audit Committee.
(Item A1)
The Authority is required to submit for approval by the Board, a balanced annual Comprehensive
Budget detailing each of its funding sources. The resolution for Item A1 approves revision of the
2002 Comprehensive Budget which resulted in the following changes: total revenue and associated
expenditures increased by $3,801,230 for a fund total of $896.5 million due to the HUD approved
5

 subsidy; increase of $500,000 to the City/State grant funds for Maplewood Court; increase of $7.2
million of HOPE VI funds to support the relocation of tenants and increase of $1.3 million to grant
funds due to the award of the Ross Service Coordinators grant.
RESOLUTION NO. 2002-CHA-77
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board letter dated June 13, 2002,
entitled “Approval of the Revised 2002 Comprehensive Budget”;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners, hereby approves the attached budget amendments,
“Approval of the Revised 2002 Comprehensive Budget”, and finds with respect to
said Budget:
1.
2.

3.

THAT,

that the proposed expenditures are necessary for the efficient and
economical operation of the Chicago Housing Authority for the purpose of
serving low-income families;
that the financial plan is reasonable in that it indicates funding sources
adequate to cover all proposed expenditures, and does not provide for use of
Federal funding in excess of that payable under the provisions of the
applicable Federal regulations; and
that all proposed rental charges and expenditures will be consistent with
provisions of law and the Annual Contributions Contract in accordance with
the Moving To Work Demonstration Agreement of the Chicago Housing
Authority with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.

the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are authorized to execute
and forward to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development all
necessary budget documents and supporting information when applicable.

(Item A2)
In November 2000, an insurance broker was retained as a consultant by the Authority through
small purchase procurement. With the aid of the Broker, the CHA was able to obtain more
competitive quotes for healthcare benefits than had been received in previous years. Additionally,
the Broker’s services enabled the CHA to reduce premiums for Life, Accidental Death and
Dismemberment, and Long Term Disability insurance. Through the Broker’s consulting services,
new benefits such as Vision Care, Short Term Disability, Flexible Spending Account, College
Saving Plan and other voluntary plans have been added to the CHA’s employee benefit package.
In May 2002, a Request for Proposal was issued to competitively solicit qualified firms to provide
these brokerage services. Forty-three firms, including 10 MBE/WBE firms were directly solicited.
Two of the three respondents were found to be in the competitive range and were requested to
submit best and final offers. Based upon its competitiveness, its overall greater experience and
the highest rating given by the evaluation committee Asch and Associates was recommended for
award of contract. Accordingly, the resolution for Item A2 approves award of contract to Asch
and Associates.
RESOLUTION NO. 2002-CHA-78
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the
memorandum dated June 27, 2002 titled “Authorization to Enter Into a Contract
with Asch & Associates for Brokerage and Consulting Services for Healthcare and
Other Employee Benefits”.
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners hereby authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to enter into a contract with Asch and Associates for brokerage and
consulting services for healthcare and other employee benefits for a two-year term
for a total contract amount of $130,416.00, with three one (1) -year options, subject
to HUD and Board approval.

(Item A3)
HUD offers incentives to housing authorities that enter into Energy Services Agreements. These
incentives allow housing authorities to leverage additional capital through the financing of
qualified energy conservation measures under an energy loan. In February 2001, the Board
6

 authorized an increase in the Energy Service Agreement with the Citizens Conservation Services
from $15 million to $30 million. A portion of the increase was funded by a loan from the City of
Chicago. In April 2002, the Board approved a loan agreement and promissory note with the City
of Chicago in the amount of $2.5 million at a zero interest rate payable over eight years beginning
in 2003. CHA anticipates financing the remaining balance with a loan from Fannie Mae.
Accordingly, the Resolution for Item A3 approves a Loan Agreement with Fannie Mae. Both the
City and Fannie Mae loans will be repaid using the additional add-on subsidy from HUD, of
approximately $1.5 million per year, and a portion of the Authority’s utility budget.
RESOLUTION NO. 2002-CHA-79
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the
memorandum dated June 14, 2002, entitled “Authorization to Enter into a Loan
Agreement with the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae)”.
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Chief Executive Officer or his designee is authorized to execute and deliver, on
behalf of the Chicago Housing Authority, a loan agreement with the Federal
National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) in the amount of $12.5 million at an
approximate interest rate of 5.9%, payable over eleven years.

(Item A4)
In March 2002, the CHA issues an RFP seeking qualified vendors interested in marketing the
licensing, on CHA’s behalf, of CHA unsecured roof top space for equipment to extend fixed and
mobile communication networks. Seven firms were solicited directly, of which one was a certified
MBE/WBE firm. Three respondents were deemed responsive and based upon an evaluation of the
proposals, the evaluation committee selected SpectraSite Communications. SpectraSite’s
compensation shall consist of 25% of the revenue received by CHA.
RESOLUTION NO. 2002-CHA-80
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated April 28, 2002
titled “Authorization to enter into a Broker Contract for licensing unsecured rooftop
space”.
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his designee
to negotiate and enter into a contract with SpectraSite for broker services for
licensing unsecured CHA rooftop space for the two-year period beginning June 16,
2002 through June 15, 2004 with three one-year options subject to HUD and Board
approval.

(Item A5)
The resolution for Item A4 approves a modification to the existing contract with Digby’s
Detective & Security Agency. This modification is necessary due to the delay of the scheduled
sale and closure of the office at 4700 South State and stalled plans for the Occupancy and
Emergency Services units to vacate the Central Warehouse. Digby has agreed to provide the
mentioned services at the same rates offered through the original competitively solicited
procurement.
RESOLUTION NO. 2002-CHA-81
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the
memorandum dated July 8, 2002 titled “Authorization to execute Modification No.

Security Agency for security personnel services to increase the original not to

In order to achieve the goals set forth in the Plan for Transformation, it is necessary for CHA to
acquire privately-owned land for development. Currently, CHA does not have an internal process
in place for land acquisition and, therefore, would like to utilize the City’s existing process for land
acquisition. The Intergovernmental Agreement recommended for approval in the resolution for
Item B13 allows the City to use funds available to CHA to acquire properties that will be mutually
agreed upon by all parties to the Agreement as being necessary for the development of the mixedincome communities. Since the City had previously committed to assist CHA in its development
efforts, the Agreement also provides that the City will reimburse the CHA an amount equal to the
funds expended for acquisition and related costs starting in the year 2006 with full reimbursement
by year end of 2011. The City’s reimbursement of funds to the CHA will ensure the availability of
sufficient funds to develop and operate public housing units in the future.
RESOLUTION NO. 2002-CHA-94
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated June 28, 2002,
requesting approval of the Intergovernmental Agreement (“Agreement”) for Land

Through separate
intergovernmental agreements, CHA will ultimately become the owner of all of the land in the
proposed development site. Draper and Kramer, as the Lake Park Crescent developer, will build a
new, mixed-income development containing 490 total units. There will be 242 rental units and

(Item B15)
The resolution for Item B15 approves the submittal of a revised Mixed Finance Proposal and
Disposition Application to HUD and to enter into various agreements for the redevelopment of

increase the number of 3-bedroom units and reduce the density of units per acre. In addition the
revised proposal increases the percentage of family units from 33% to 39%. This will better

the existing seniors on the site. Market rate units, in the revised proposal, have been eliminated in
order to increase tax credit basis and close the funding gap in the development budget. Finally,
