Report from System Chief Quality Officer
A. Regulatory and Accreditation Updates
Dr. Krishna Das, System Chief Quality Officer, provided an update on regulatory and accreditation visits.
She stated that staff is awaiting visits from surveyors from The Joint Commission to the Ambulatory and
Community Health Network of Cook County (ACHN) and to Provident Hospital of Cook County. She
stated that, from a timing perspective, they are near the end of the window of time for the visit to ACHN, as
the last survey took place in April.

Report from System Chief Quality Officer
A. Regulatory and Accreditation Updates (continued)
The other matter relates to a for-cause survey by Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) staff that took
place in January, which was based on a patient complaint that was submitted to the Centers for Medicare
and Medicaid Services (CMS). The official report has been received on the survey; the hospital was found
to have no condition-level deficiencies in the report. She noted that, usually when they do a survey, they
leave it up to the hospital administration to provide a response, which is due within thirty days; a response
will be provided, with planned actions.

B. Publicly Reported Ratings
There were no updates to provide on this subject.
C. Quarterly Quality Report – 4th Quarter 2013 (Attachment #1)
Dr. Das provided an overview of the Quarterly Quality Report. The Committee reviewed and discussed the
information.
During the discussion of the information on slide 3 of the presentation, regarding Emergency Department
(ED) wait to be seen time, Dr. Das stated that the target is currently set at 120 minutes. Last year the target
was set at 150 minutes, but because the targets were being consistently exceeded, the targets were re-set one
year ago from 150 to 120 minutes. Chairman Collens inquired regarding the baseline for hospitals that are
comparable to Stroger Hospital. Dr. Das responded that CMS presents the national median, which is
approximately 30-45 minutes. Staff has tried to get a median figure for the safety-net hospitals; she noted
that the number will be higher than what is presented by CMS. Director Lerner recommended that staff
contact America’s Essential Hospitals (formerly the National Association of Public Hospitals and Health
Systems) or University HealthSystem Consortium (UHC) to see if they have any statistics in this area. He
noted that, even if one were to do a composite of all safety net hospitals in Chicago, there is such variability
that they would not be equivalent to Stroger Hospital. Dr. Das stated that she will contact them to get a
baseline. Director Lerner remarked that it would be beneficial if, at some point in the future, the Committee
can have a further discussion about the establishment of objective baselines1.
With regard to the indicators on slide 3 pertaining to inpatient operational efficiencies, it was noted that both
Stroger and Provident Hospitals have same targets. Director Lerner stated that, at some point in the future,
once the operations improvement teams have been operating in both places, the Committee should do a
deep dive on these issues to determine what is the realistic level to target in order to better treat patients,
while recognizing that there will be ED frequenters and people coming into the ED for shelter. Dr. Das
stated that she will provide a follow-up session on this subject2.
With regard to the information presented on patient satisfaction, Chairman Collens inquired whether there
are there one or two specific complaints that get mentioned in the surveys. Dr. Das stated that there are two
major groups of drivers: the first group is related to cleanliness/environment; and the second group seems to
be communication with nursing staff, along with several nursing-specific features. Dr. Das added that she
would be happy to do a more detailed presentation on patient satisfaction in the future, together with the
Chief Operating Officers3.

Report from System Chief Quality Officer
C. Quarterly Quality Report – 4th Quarter 2013 (continued)
Director Gugenheim inquired regarding the mechanisms in place to share this information with staff. Dr.
Das stated that, last year, the administration had an initiative that took place around mid-year where it was
shared with physician and nursing leadership at both hospitals; ACHN had a similar initiative where it was
also shared with their leadership. When presenting to those groups, the administration asked that the
information be shared with other groups, including the Executive Medical Staffs and within the
departments, so that the data could be pushed down to the front line level. She noted that the nursing units
actually post their nursing satisfaction data on every unit of the hospital, so employees can see where they
are and how they compare to the other nursing units, and can see what changes they have been able to make
over the year.
During the discussion of the indicator on slide 7 regarding the percentage of patients incarcerated whose
diabetes are being controlled (measure of diabetes controlled within target), there were several questions
posed regarding the reasons why the target and actual outcomes data appear to be low. Several factors that
influence the ability to control diabetes, including those specific to a jail setting, were mentioned, including
the factor that diabetes treatment is never a perfect science - every diabetic detainee is treated, but like any
other disease, the treatment is only effective to a certain degree.
Dr. Das stated that this is a fairly aggressive target for diabetes control; 43% is reasonable – it is probably
not ideal and should be better, but if one looks throughout the country, that is where the measures have been
set. It was noted that this indicator is mandated by the Department of Justice. Dr. Ram Raju, Chief
Executive Officer, provided additional comments. He stated that everyone is treated, but the question is
regarding the measurement of outcome - how many diabetic detainees do better with treatment is what is
being measured. Director Lerner remarked that this is exactly the kind of problem that he expects to see
with CountyCare patients who have, in the past, gone without consistent care. Setting quality indicators for
the CountyCare population will be critically important, but he stated that Chairman Collens brings up a
good point - Board Members have to 1) understand the sequelae; 2) understand the impact of the outcome;
and 3) understand the feasibility of achieving that outcome.
During the discussion of the outpatient services indicators relating to ACHN, Dr. Das noted that a more
detailed presentation can be made by representatives from ACHN on that subject in the future4.

D. 2013 Report on Infection Control (Attachment #2)
Dr. Sharon Welbel, System Chief of Infection Control, provided an overview of the 2013 Report on
Infection Control. Subjects contained in the report included the following: Surveillance; Device-Related
Infections; Surgical Site Infection; Multi-Drug Resistant Organisms; and Compliance Monitoring. The
Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
