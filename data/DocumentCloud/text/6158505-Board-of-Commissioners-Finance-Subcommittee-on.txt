As indicated in Resolution 2684, the City requests 47 parcels of the requested 56 to allow redevelopment
opportunities along our Dixie Highway Commercial Corridor and 154th Street in our Downtown Business
District, which is in close proximity to the Municipal Center.

In addition, the City has two (2) Third Party Requestors, EQ Illinois and Outreach Community Development
Corporation. EQ Illinois is requesting one (1) parcel of commercial property for the expansion of their business
in Harvey. Outreach Community Development Corporation is requesting eight (8) parcels of land to redevelop
residential properties to increase the housing within the City of Harvey.

Page 22 of 24

The City will retain legal counsel and pay all costs for tax deeds. The City will report as required to the Cook
County Bureau Economic Development annually from the date of sale on each parcel for ?ve (5) years or until
the development is completed. If a City of Harvey lien is cleared by the no cash bid, the City agrees to this in
that the future redevelopment is more valuable to the City than the cost of the municipal lien. If a Cook County
lien is on a parcel, the City agrees to reinstate the lien after the tax sale for the County with an intergovernmental
agreement to be recorded.

Summary: It is the intention of the City of Chicago Heights to convey all parcels to the Third Party Requestor,
Wilkins Son, LLC. Wilkins Son, LLC is currently leasing the land from the current owners and minimal
work is being conducted within the actual structure. Building upon recent growth and expansion, Wilkins 

Son has had a successful and longstanding presence in Chicago Heights resulting in growth and job expansion

for the community. As background, Wilkins Son, including Wilkins Rebuilders/Brook?eld Iron Metal, is a
metal scrapping company that dismantles all types of machinery and farms out parts to be reused or
remanufactured. Also, Wilkins has had two property expansions in the last two years, adding nearly 50 jobs.

This new land opportunity would allow operations to continue to expand with the creation of a trailer dismantling
center in addition to the opening of a rail facility that would utilize the onsite rail spur to transport scrap. With
this added mode of transportation Wilkins also could trans-load scrap for two publicly traded companies. A direct
result of this new expansion will be an increase of job opportunities in Chicago Heights. The redevelopment of
the parcels will return the property to a viable use bene?cial to the municipality. The redevelopment will also
return the properties to a tax producing status, thereby generating economic development for the municipality and
other taxing bodies.

The City of Chicago Heights will accept an assignment of all Tax Certi?cate of Purchase from Cook County and
will undertake such legal proceedings and tax search services as necessary to obtain a tax deed and will bear all
legal and other costs associated with the acquisition of the parcels. Also, the City of Chicago Heights agrees to
submit, to the Cook County Bureau of Economic Development, No Cash Bid Reports on the status of each
parcel for ?ve years or until development is complete, whichever occurs last, as required by the Cook County
No Cash Bid Ordinance. Finally, the City of Chicago Heights, if needed, will ?le for tax exempt status on all
parcels obtained and will retain such status until such time as the parcel is conveyed.
