RESOLUTION CALLING FOR A PUBLIC HEARING REGARDING THE IMPACT
OF UTILIZATION OF GROUP PURCHASING ORGANIZATIONS ON M/WBEs
(PROPOSED RESOLUTION). Submitting a Proposed Resolution sponsored by
Roberto Maldonado, County Commissioner; Co-sponsored by Peter N. Silvestri
and Joseph Mario Moreno, County Commissioners.
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, on April 9, 2009 the Cook County Health and Hospitals System
Board (“System Board”) adopted the Procurement Policy for the Cook County
Health and Hospitals System (“System”); and
WHEREAS, the System Board took this action pursuant to the Ordinance
Establishing the Cook County Health and Hospitals System (“Enabling
Ordinance”) which expressly provides that the System Board shall have the
authority over all procurement and contracts for the System, and further provides
that the System may exercise this authority, in whole or in part, pursuant to its
discretion; and
WHEREAS, as the System’s Interim Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), David R.
Small, stated in a letter to the Board of Commissioners dated April 20, 2009, the
System Board has stated that it is genuinely committed to the County’s policy to
promote equal opportunity in its procurement process and has expressly set forth
in the System’s new Procurement Policy that Protected Class Enterprises shall
participate in not less than 35 percent of the annual aggregate value of all
contracts awarded by the System; and

WHEREAS, in furtherance of its mission to ensure sound fiscal management of
all aspects of the System, the System has issued a Request for Proposal (“RFP”)
for the System’s participation in a Group Purchasing Organization (“GPO”), a
purchasing consortia that the Systems argues is in the best interest of the
System and its patients; and
WHEREAS, numerous local small business owners who are certified as Minority
and Women Owned Business Enterprises (“M/WBEs”) oppose the System’s use
of a GPO stating that it would eliminate their ability to do business with the
County because GPOs shut out small M/WBE businesses and offer opportunities
only to majority corporations who pay to participate in GPO contracts; and
WHEREAS, as an example of this exclusion, the M/WBE business owners allege
that a vendor currently supplying pharmaceuticals to the System through a
contract previously approved by the County Board has not met its M/WBE
participation goals as agreed to in its contract; and
WHEREAS, the System disputes this allegation, stating that the County Board
approved a reduced M/WBE participation goal of 3 percent due to the stringent
manufacture and delivery standards for the purchase of pharmaceuticals and the
vendor is satisfying this participation; and
WHEREAS, the Director of the Office of Contract Compliance states a different
finding in a Memorandum to the Chair of Contract Compliance, dated April 20,
2009, concluding that the pharmaceutical vendor’s 3% goal has not been met.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, in an effort to protect the integrity of
the M/WBE Ordinance and the impact utilization of GPOs will have on M/WBEs,
the Contract Compliance Committee of the Cook County Board will convene a
public hearing and will request to hear testimony from the following: Warren
Batts, Chairman, System Board; David R. Small, Interim System CEO; Leslie
Duffy, System Chief Procurement Officer; Betty Hancock Perry, Director of the
Office of Contract Compliance; and representatives from the M/WBE small
business community, as well as from other members of the public.
*Referred to the Contract Compliance Committee on 05-05-09.
