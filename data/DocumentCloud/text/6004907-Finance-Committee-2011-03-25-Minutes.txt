IV. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items (continued)
B. Presentation of Lawson Financial Statements through December 2010 (Attachment #4)
Dorothy Loving, Executive Director of Finance, presented the Lawson Financial Statements through December
2010. The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
It was noted that the Committee is receiving financial information from the first month of the fiscal year after
the end of the first quarter. Ms. Loving stated that, pending the approval of the County budget, there was a lot
of financial data for major pieces such as payroll and other expenses, to which the System did not have access.
Discussion took place on the subject of the current status of the Lawson System. Chairman Carvalho requested
that Mr. Ayres draft a letter from Chairman Carvalho and Board Chairman Batts to County administration, to
invite representatives from the County’s Finance and Information Technology Departments to a meeting of the
CCHHS Finance Committee, in order for them to observe the Committee’s challenges associated with
receiving and reacting to delayed financial information.
Director O’Donnell, seconded by Director Muñoz, moved to accept the Lawson Financial
Statements through December 2010. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
C. Notification of Emergency Purchases (Attachment #5)
In accordance with Part II, Section 2.8 of the Cook County Health and Hospitals System Procurement Policy
that states that emergency purchases be reported to the Finance Committee no later than at its next regularly
scheduled meeting, Ms. Stith notified the Committee that emergency purchases have been made. Also in
accordance with the Policy, a communication in writing was sent to Chairman Carvalho and Board Chairman
Batts on this matter.

V.

Report from System Chief Financial Officer (Attachment #6)
A. FY2011 Budget Update
B. Report of Paid Board Bills (Attachment #7)
Mr. Ayres provided an update on the following subjects: PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) Update –
Transformation Economic Plan, Transformation Benefits Dashboard and Physician Charge Capture and
Education; PwC Invoice Payment; Chamberlin Edmonds (CEA) Update – Eligibility Service Update for the
Month ending February 2011 and Interagency Agreement Status; Revenue Report – CCHHS Patient Cash
Summary and Medicaid Approved Account and Return Visits Study; and the 2011 Budget Update. The
Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
In response to Chairman Carvalho’s question regarding whether the System is expected to have a net revenue
increase as a result of implementation of physician billing, in terms of unbundled rates rather than having one
bundled rate, Mr. Ayres responded affirmatively; although he noted that Medicaid may be an exception to this
– due to the complexity around how Medicaid established the all-inclusive rate, it is uncertain whether there
will be a net revenue increase. He added that the subject of unbundling Medicaid rates will continue to be
explored. William Luallen, of PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), provided additional information on the subject.

V.

Report from System Chief Financial Officer (continued)
During the discussion of the CEA update, questions were raised regarding the status of the Amendment to the
Intergovernmental Agreement that was approved by the System Board last month, to address the issue
involving the State’s backlog in processing the System’s eligibility applications. The Amendment allows the
System to pay the State to fund positions that will process System eligibility applications. Mr. Ayres stated
that the Amendment has been signed by all parties; the next step is for the State to hire or transfer state
employees into the positions. Board Chairman Batts noted that, from the information provided by Mr. Ayres,
it appears that, of the $40 million anticipated to be collected by the System as a result of the State’s processing
of eligibility applications, the System may have lost potential revenues, due to expiring applications. Mr.
Ayres concurred; he stated that applications expire after one year. Also mentioned was the fact that the System
is experiencing a delay in receiving payments for those applicants deemed eligible; Chairman Carvalho noted
that, quite often when there is a new State Comptroller in office, it has been helpful to remind them that these
payments are not drawn from the State’s General Revenue Fund, as they are paid from federal dollars.
The Committee received an update on the FY2011 Budget, and reviewed the floor amendments affecting the
System that were approved by the Cook County Board at their meeting on February 25-26th. Information was
provided on a proposed amendment, that would allow the System to spend any additional revenues captured
during the year; this related to the potential of $40 million in revenue that could be realized as a result of the
State’s processing of eligibility applications. As noted above, the certainty of the State processing these
applications in order to fully realize these revenues, is tenuous. However, this proposed amendment would
have allowed the System to be able to use the revenues achieved from this for health care purposes; currently,
if additional revenues are realized, they are deposited into the County’s General Fund. However, instead of the
amendment as proposed, an amendment passed that turned the $40 million into “anticipated revenue” and the
County’s subsidy to the System was decreased by that amount.

VI. Closed Session Discussion/Information Item
A. Cook County Department of Public Health Grant Personnel Matter
Director O’Donnell, seconded by Director Muñoz, moved to recess the regular session
and convene into closed session, pursuant to the following exception to the Illinois Open
Meetings Act:
5 ILCS 120/2(c)(1), regarding “the appointment, employment,
compensation, discipline, performance, or dismissal of specific employees of the public
body or legal counsel for the public body, including hearing testimony on a complaint
lodged against an employee of the public body or against legal counsel for the public
body to determine its validity.”
On the motion to recess the regular session and convene into closed session, a roll call
was taken, the votes of yeas and nays being as follows:
Yeas:

Chairman Carvalho and Directors Muñoz and O’Donnell (3)

Nays:

None (0)

Absent:

Directors Golden and Ramirez (2)

THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY and the Committee convened into closed
session.
Chairman Carvalho declared that the closed session was adjourned. The Committee
reconvened into regular session.

PRIOR CONTRACT HISTORY:

Previously, each hospital contracted for Clinical Engineering (CE) Services through various contractors. Each
contract held varying contract termination dates. Based on the application of a leveraged contracting methodology, a
decision was reached to consolidate all of the CCHHS CE operating requirements into a single provider of services.
The existing CE agreements have expiration dates ranging from 03/20/2011 through 06/30/2011. To eliminate the
need to Extend and Increase each of these agreements, it is recommended that the CCHHS establish a bridge
arrangement to the system agreement which is targeted to begin on 07/01/2011. Accordingly, the CCHHS would roll
the expiring agreements into a Time and Material (T&M) arrangement with ARAMARK Healthcare until the new
CCHHS agreement is implemented. Time and Material will be based on parts and services required for the specific
equipment previously covered under the expiring contracts during the bridge arrangement period.
In addition, the current ARAMARK Healthcare agreement which covers CE and the Plant Operations Maintenance
Management Information System [POMMIS (a call center for plant operations)] at Stroger Hospital will expire on
03/31/2011 (please see schedule on page 2). As a result of the multi-service coverage under this agreement, it is
not recommended to move to a T&M arrangement during the bridge arrangerr ~mA_

The Department of Surgery is requesting this technology due to its unique tissue effect sensing technology for
precise energy delivery. The ESU produces tissue effects by concentrating high-frequency electric currents at the
target tissue, causing it to heat, and thereby altering the cellular structure.

PRIOR CONTRACT HISTORY:
O'Hare Record Retention currently stores a large number of Cook County Health and Hospitals System [CCHHS]
records; several affiliates have relatively small arrangements which will continue to remain in place for some or all of
the period prior to transition to the Cook County Hawthorne storage facility, which is expected to occur within the next
12-18 months.
NEW PROPOSAL JUSTIFICATION:

The CCHHS respectfully requests approval to enter into a contract with O'Hare Record Retention of Chicago, Illinois,
to provide interim off-site medical record indexing, storage and retrieval services for the CCHHS. A Request for
Proposal (RFP) was issued in late 2010 for an off-site medical records management contract; four proposals were
received. After reviewing these proposals and considering the best operating model for record storage, it was
determined that the CCHHS would bring this function in-house within the next few years to consolidate, store and
manage all of its medical records within a Cook County-owned property. This action will be combined with an
effective record retention schedule, which will permit scanning and/or destruction of medical records at appropriate
intervals, thus reducing the volumes of paper records remaining in storage. A more limited interim
contract will be required as a result of this strategy. For this purpose, O'H11m-J~•••n~IPI

 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
INTRODUCTION
In May 2008, the Cook County Board of Commissioners renamed the Cook County
Health Facilities as the Cook County Health and Hospital System (CCHHS).
This discussion and analysis provides the readers of the monthly unaudited financial
statements of the CCHHS with an overview of the financial activities and financial
activities for the month ended December 31, 2010. This discussion focuses on the
significant financial issues and major financial activities during the current month. It
should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements of the
CCHHS.
The CCHHS includes the following entities: John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital (JSH); Oak
Forest Hospital (OFH); Provident Hospital (PHCC); the Department of Public Health
(DPH); the Ambulatory and Community Health Network (ACHN); the Bureau of Health
Services (BHS); and Cermak Health Services (CHS). Collectively, these entities provide
primary, intermediate, acute, and tertiary medical care to patients, without regard to their
ability to pay. The Bureau of Health Services oversees the operational, planning, and
policy activities of the CCHHS.
The CCHHS is included in the reporting entity of the Cook County, Illinois, as an
enterprise fund. As an enterprise fund, the CCHHS’ financial statements are prepared
using proprietary fund accounting that focuses on the determination of changes in net
assets, financial position, and cash flows in a manner similar to private sector businesses.
The financial statements are prepared on an accrual basis of accounting, which
recognizes revenue when earned and expenses when incurred.
SUMMARY OF OPERATING AND FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS
The Cook County Health and Hospital Systems continues to undertake significant
restructuring with a focus on operational efficiency so that the system can better fulfill its
mission of serving the health care needs of the region. Effective in July, 2010 CCBHHS
engaged Price Waterhouse Coopers as its revenue cycle vendor to re-engineer the
revenue cycle process and to improve efficiencies within the expenditure process.
FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS (IN THOUSANDS)
The Cook County Health and Hospitals System finished the month with overall revenue
of $92,657 and overall expenses was $80,660.
Net Patient revenue for the month was $61,089.
Net Patient revenue consists of all charges including automated contractual allowances
and bad debt adjustments. Write-off of Bad Debt is a CCHHS Board approved policy.
Other revenue was $51. Other revenue consists primarily of parking and cafeteria
revenue.

 Accounts Receivable
In December the System implemented the new single billing platform patient accounting
system. The new system has been designated as BEPA (browser enabled patient
accounting). The new system replaces the three separate systems that were used by the
three system hospitals in the past. The use of a common system now eliminates the
differences between the three separate systems.
The implementation of the new system has had an impact on the level of outstanding
accounts receivable. The billing of patient accounts through the BEPA system was
suspended for the month of December to insure that everything was correct prior to the
resumption of billing. Accounts that were on the three legacy systems continued to be
billed in December from those systems. The billing from the BEPA system was resumed
in January. The delay in billing the BEPA accounts produced an increase in the total
outstanding accounts receivable at the end of December.
Accounts receivable at the end of December increased by approximately 21 million
dollars or 4% from the November month end amounts. In the future months this increase
in outstanding accounts receivable will be resolved as the accounts are billed, paid, and
posted to the systems. The legacy systems will continue to be used for the accounts with
dates of service prior to December 1, 2010, until the majority of the outstanding balances
have been collected or processed off the systems. The balances from the legacy systems
are not going to be moved to the BEPA system. The BEPA system will maintain the
account information for all three hospitals for accounts with a date of service after
December 1, 2010.
Operating Expenses at the end the month was $80,660 broken down as follows:
Salaries and Wages - $44,133
Benefits - $11,527
Supplies - $8,738
Purchased Services, Rental, and Other - $8,744
Depreciation - $3,034
Utilities - $24
Insurance - $4,460
Nonoperating Revenue was $31,517. The largest portions of this are attributed to sales
tax in the amount of $14,630 and property tax in the amount of $12,022.
Taxes collected for the Health to date have been fully credited to the Health Fund.
OVERVIEW OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Page 36 of 95

 This discussion and analysis are intended to serve as an introduction to the CCHHS
financial statements. CCHHS basic monthly unaudited financial statements are
comprised of fund financial statements.
A fund is a grouping of related accounts that is used to maintain control over resources
that have been segregated for specific activities or objectives. The CCHHS, like other
state and local governments, uses fund accounting to ensure and demonstrate compliance
with finance-related legal requirements.

PWC Update
Transformation Economic Plan

Exhibit 1 is the -- Transforming Our System through Growth and Ef?ciency
Performance Improvement Update through March 25, 2001. This material has been
prepared. by PWC as part of their reporting to the organization.

Slide 3 is the Transformation Economic Plan through February 28, 2011. The schedule
identi?es the seven primary work streams with two views -- 24 months or total project
and calendar 201 1. Each work stream shows the value proposition 24 months compared
to the actual benefits obtained through the reporting period and the budget for calendar
year 201 1 compared with the actual bene?ts achieved. Two of the work streams Public
Health and Cermak -- do not have any anticipated. value. The other live work streams,
however, are the primary focus of the projects efforts.

Through February, we have achieved approximately $75 million in bene?ts against the
project target of $313.8 million; for calendar 2011 the bene?t is $33.0 million against a
budget of $100 million. The majority of this benefit has been obtained. through. the
revenue cycle activity which has been the main point of emphasis throughout the
organization.

Transformation Benefits Dashboard

 

Slide 4 is the Transformation Benefits Dashboard and presents a different view of
the projects status. The gray bars for each initiative shows the anticipated 
bene?t while the arrows represent the actual bene?ts achieved to date. The Revenue
Cycle was anticipated to have $16.2 million in benefit through February but has achieved
$70 million. The green bar implies that there is $76.8 million of benefit achieved but
$6.8 million has not yet been confirmed. The Supply Chain was anticipated to have
achieved $21.4 million but by February had only accomplished $5 million which has not
yet been validated. The other work streams have active planning underway with
identi?ed areas of bene?t and are currently in the implementation stages.

Physician Charge Capture and Education

 

Exhibit 11 is the Physician Charge Capture and Education Initiative as of March 17, 2011.
The presentation summarizes where stands on registering physicians in the

Page 64 of 95

PECOS system, the status of the contract with McKesson for physician billing services
and the process being made in physician education and training.

PECOS Approval. Tracking

In order to bill Medicare, each physician must be enrolled in the PECOS database and
very few of the physicians had. active status with the program. In November
2010 an initiative was launched with applications for 818 physicians submitted to the
intermediary. As of March 18, 466 or 57% of the applications had been approved. In
addition, approximately 112 additional applications have been submitted for new
physicians joining medical staff. We continued to commit significant resource to
ensuring that there is appropriate follow-up with any questions asked from the approval
agency.

Physician Billing Model and Vendor Contracting Status

McKesson has been selected as the winning vendor from an RF process to identify the
apprOpriate resource for the physician billing services. This is an activity that cannot be
easily or efficiently performed by and needs to be outsourced in its entirety
including charge capture, coding, documentation, billing and follow collections. We are
currently in the ?nal process of negotiating the contract and obtaining the appropriate
clearances through the legal and corporate compliance and anticipate the contract will be
before Governance in its April cycle.

Physician Education and Training

PWC. has completed approximately 13 baseline training sessions within 
including approximately 314 physicians out of 824 who are anticipated to be eligible to
bill for their services. The baseline training will continue and then be augmented by the
Specific McKesson training once the contract is approved and implementation has begun.

Estimated Physician Fee Revenue

The calculation to determine the potential revenue to be generated from professional
services has been complicated by the absence of historical data showing the frequency
and type of services provided by attending physicians. This was the result of the
combined billing arrangements with Medicare and Medicaid, the complexity of
performing physician charge capture, documentation and billing activities and the belief
that since the majority of patients were self~pay the revenue would not be sufficient to
justify the effort. Over the last four months studies were performed to identify a baseline
of how much. revenue is potentially available with active physician billing. Based on the
?ndings, we estimate physician. revenue on current fee?for-service patients is
approximately $11.7 million per year. This assumes that we make no change in the
Medicare or Medicaid contractual agreements currently in effect. By converting
Medicare from the current cost formulas to fee-for-service schedules, it is estimated that
reimbursement would. increase by an additional $6.6 million to $18.2 million. The next

Page 65 of 95

step would be the conversion of our current fixed?price contract with Medicaid. to .fee-for~
service. While there is a very modest increase in the potential revenues, the estimates are
clouded by the complexity of the reimbursement formulas in the processes the state uses
to determine our cost. Furthermore, the changing relationship acquire significant
negotiations with the state.

We are currently working toward. the implementation of the billing system with
McKesson and immediately began billing under the existing fee?fonservice formulas.
Once this process have stabilized and then tested, we will reevaluate the bene?ts of
converting to fee-tbr-service with Medicare.

PWC Invoice Payment

Schedule A is the Revenue Cycle Benefit Summary identifying the PWC with
cumulative project cash received between August 17, 2010 and February 28, 2001. The
total benefit is $70.017 million. Applying the 16% payment ratio, PWC has 
million in fees. Today, PWC has been paid $7.5 million and have submitted invoices for
December and January totaling $5 million. Management proposes to pay the December
invoice based on the February cumulative bene?ts. If the March cumulative benefits
exceed $78.2 million we will process the January invoice.

Chamberlin Edmonds Update
Eligibility Services Update month ending February 2011

The February adjudicated accounts inventory grew by 350 claims of which 233 were
inpatient and 117 outpatient. The total unadjusted applications increased by 106 claims
to 14,180 with federal. claims decreasing by 24 and state increasing by 130. Accounts
approved and converted to cash improved to 16% in February compared to 8% in
January. The average remittance, however, decreased approximately $1,000 per claim in
February as a result of fewer payments of claims over $100,000. Total. remittance
increased to $7.5 million in February on higher remitted volumes.

The number of approved but unpaid accounts has increased each month from July 2010
and has now reached 1,819 accounts with the growth in the application inventory now
totaling 14,180. In addition to the growth in applications inventory we are starting to see
applications that have been unprocessed for over a year. Once this occurs, it is unlikely
that the state will process the application resulting in the anticipated revenue for that
period being lost. To compound the problem, the federal government is starting the
process of decreasing the match rate for Medicaid. payments which will decrease the net
reimbursement received by the health system. Based on the February claims inventory,
the decline in the FMAP on the net receivable is approximately $10.1 million. We will
keep you posted on the process of attempting have our application is approved, accounts
paid and the impact of the FMAP changes.

linteragencv Agreement Status

As of Tuesday, March 22, the interagency agreement had been approved by the County
Commission and signed by chairman Batts. As soon as it is signed by Pres. Preckwinkle
it will be given to the state for execution. Once agreed to, will immediately
authorized the use of overtime for state employees while the process of identifying,
training and locating the staff is underway.

. Revenue Report
Patient Cash Summary

Schedule is the Patient Cash Summary for the period ending February, 2011.
The decline in collections for November, December and January were the result of claims
submission. delays caused by the migration to the single Siemens platform on December
1, 2010. This change had a material impact on the speed with which claims could be
completed because each account required an independent review to ensure its compliance
and accuracy. 01] January 1, 2011, we implemented the price increase which delayed
claims submission for approximately 10 days to allow for claims correction. Revenues
from this period are not lost rather delay. The budget anticipated a sharp increase in
collections in February but did not anticipate the claims processing slowdown from
Medicaid (the largest payer) and continued delay in application approvals. Collections
begin to recover in February and March?s are in track to exceed budget. I will have
collections through March 23 for the Finance Committee meeting on Friday.

Medicaid Approved Account and Return Visits Studv

Schedule is an analysis of the repeat visits to a facility after a self-pay patient
qualifies for Medicaid. The analysis covers the approval and visits between January 2010
and February 2011. Of the 2,832 approved accounts, 52.2% returned to a 
facility for their first follow~up visit; 38.6% returned for a second repeat visit and 33.4%
returned for the third repeat visit. This data argues against previous assumption that
patients were not returning a system facility after they obtain their Medicaid benefits.
We are expanding the study to look at both location and clinical service provide.

2011 Budget Update

The County is still de?ning the Shutdown/furlough Day Program. We have submitted a
listing of the "essential positions" that would have to operate on a shutdown Day using
Christmas day for the staf?ng schedule. Subsequently, the County asked for all
employee?s that would be assigned to essential positions. As yet, we are uncertain as to
who is included in shutdown and furlough days and have been unable to calculate the
economic implications ofthc program.

Page 67 of 95

Based. on the final budget amendments, our anticipated 20] l. revenues have increased by
$39 million to $631 million. There were relatively minor changes in expense and we are
currently waiting for the impact of the shutdown/furlough. Day program to calculate our
final appropriations. During the budgeting process we identi?ed approximately $22
million worth of expense reductions that had not been allocated to out the system. Within
the next 30 days management will assign the reductions.

Our current challenge lies with the potential challenge in meeting the budget given delays
in the implementation of strategic plan and changes in Oak. Forest and Provident; delays
in the transformation work anticipated and the uncertainty of the recent CON Board
decision to delay approval of the restructuring at Oak Forest Hospital. Management is
actively developing plans to keep the budget within the approved parameters. We will
have a better understanding of the remedial actions required as there is clari?cation on

claims. There are opportunities to improve organizatiomwide accuracy in data capture and
processes.

There are systematic processes (hospital wide and county wide) that may delay the cash
collections cycle and impact the statement of an accurate Accounts Receivable. Recent analysis
estimates there are ?1041436 accounts for $41,692,810 in the AR that are uncollectable (greater
than 730 days/2 years) and remain unresolved. This congests workflow in efforts to collect the
mere viable accounts receivable.

Need to develop and enhance the caliber of PFS departmental management and staff via
reporting, quality and performance standards.

inhibited by aged union contracts.

Decentralized supply chain management functions throughout add
complexities and additional time required for strategic sourcing and materials
management operations.

Due to the ineffective launch of Taleo a significant amount of time was lost resulting
in the recruiting needs of the hospital not being met.

Currently over 25 vacant positions in revenue cycle directors and middle
