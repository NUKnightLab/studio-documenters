SIR [Standardized Infection Ratio] is a summary measure which compares the actual number of
Healthcare Associated Infections (Hill) in a facility with the baseline data for standard population.
SIR 1.0 indicates more Hills were observed than predicted, conversely 1.0 indicates that
fewer H?ils were observed than predicted.

Preliminary Data: March and April 2019
*Stage III or IV hospital acquired; O/E Ratio above 1.000 indicates performance worse than reference population

 Current Processes for VTE and HAPI prevention
• Quarterly Prevalence surveillance with action planning (Incidence surveillance
to be added in September)
• Braden Assessment and VTE(venous thromboembolism) Risk Assessment
• Inclusion of at risk patients and prevention strategies during hand off
• Optimization of mechanical devices such as sequential compression devices
(SCD) to prevent VTE
• Turning Clock and Turning Schedules
• Wound/Ostomy nurses serving as consultants to physicians and staff receiving
notification of all at risk patients

 Planned Interventions-VTE
Current State:
Future State:
*Inpatient units have sequential compression
*Evaluate use of sequential compression
devices for inpatients
devices for outpatients
*a risk assessment tool for VTE
undergoing procedures > 1 hour or
requiring anesthesia
*Create a standard VTE prevention plan
for all areas such as endoscopy

Identify all areas with
patients at risk for VTE

 Planned Interventions-Pressure Ulcer
Project aim: To recommend, develop and implement evidence-based practices relative to skin care
and pressure injury prevention and intervention at Cook County Health System
GOAL: Decrease HAPI by 15% by 11/2019
