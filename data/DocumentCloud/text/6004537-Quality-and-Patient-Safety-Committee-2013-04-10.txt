Report from System Interim Director of Quality and Patient Safety (Attachment #1)
Dr. John Jay Shannon, Chief of Clinical Integration, presented the April 2013 Quality Report from the
Ambulatory and Community Health Network of Cook County (ACHN). He introduced the following
individuals from ACHN, who provided an overview of the report: Dr. Stephen Stabile, Chair of the ACHN
Quality Council; and Irene Marks, APN, Interim Director of Quality and Accreditation for ACHN. Subjects
reviewed in the report included the following: ACHN Patients – data, demographics, prevalence of chronic
disease and financial class; ACHN Quality Council; Quality Committees; current Committee initiatives; Quality
monitoring; 2012 National Patient Safety Goals Compliance; strategy for improvement; Patient-Centered
Medical Home Initiative; and ACHN Quality Goals. The Committee discussed the information.
An error was noted on page 5 of the presentation. Ms. Marks indicated that the information should reflect that
56% of the ACHN patients are female, and 44% of the patients are male.

Report from System Interim Director of Quality and Patient Safety (continued)
Chairman Michael noted that 65% of the patients in 2012 were uninsured, according to the information
presented. He asked whether the administration knows what percentage of that 65% might be eligible for
CountyCare. Dr. Ram Raju, Chief Executive Officer, responded that, as reflected on page 5 of the presentation,
the patients between the ages of 25-64 (70%) and 19-24 (8%) would be eligible; the only exception to this
would be those undocumented residents included within the two groups. In response to Chairman Michael’s
question regarding the percentage of undocumented residents within those two groups, Dr. Raju stated that he
was unsure, but indicated that he would follow-up on the question1.
Chairman Michael inquired whether data is available regarding patient compliance with medications for those
patients being treated for hypertension. He stated that, as the System moves to a medical home model, it will be
important to be able to follow patients with chronic conditions and make sure they are taking their medications;
it is relatively inexpensive to prescribe hypertension medication – if the patient takes the medication, the
condition is able to be controlled, in a lot of cases. Dr. Enrique Martinez, Medical Director of Outpatient
Services, stated that this data should be available; he indicated that he will produce a report2.
Chairman Michael noted that the System will need to become more intensive in follow-up and tracking of
patients. He inquired regarding the status of the implementation of information technology strategies for this
purpose. Dr. Stabile responded that a care management application or patient registry is being built specifically
for the System by staff in the Information Technology (IT) Department. Chairman Michael asked whether this
application would allow for the ability to communicate directly with the patients. Dr. Stabile responded that
this application is an internal tool; it is not a patient portal. Chairman Michael inquired whether there is a text
messaging system that is linked to the day-of-care plan that can be used to remind patients to take their
medication, especially for those patients with chronic diseases and conditions. Dr. Stabile responded that this
concept is the next evolution that the IT Department is working on, in order to have better ways of connecting
with the patients. Dr. Shannon stated that this concept is one that is currently being tested in clinical trials. Dr.
Stabile noted that, with regard to the System’s specialty referral system, IRIS, patients get text messages and/or
emails to notify them of their appointments and reminders. Dr. David Barker, Chief Medical Officer of the
Ruth M. Rothstein CORE Center of Cook County, provided additional information regarding the subject. He
stated that having a patient portal is a Meaningful Use requirement; staff from Health Information Systems and
Cerner are working on creating a patient portal. He indicated that he is not sure whether text messaging will be
included as a feature, but he stated that it will have several features for patients to access, including health
education information and test results.
With regard to care management, Director Velasquez inquired whether community health workers are currently
part of the care management team. Dr. Stabile responded in the negative. Director Velasquez stated that
community health workers help to support change in the behavior of the patient; their services are integral to the
provision of primary care and the patient-centered medical home.
Chairman Michael stated that great improvements have been made to improve the ability to electronically order
medications and get them to the patient. He asked whether the percentage is known of those patients who fail to
get their prescription the first time it is ordered. Dr. Stabile responded that he believes the percentage is very
low, as the ability to address those types of issues is so much better now. Dr. Raju noted that, in the future, that
percentage should shrink even further, because the CountyCare patients will have a pharmacy benefit
management company; those patients will be able to get their prescriptions filled at their local pharmacy and
will not be limited to having to have their prescriptions filled at Stroger Hospital or at Oak Forest Health Center.

Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
A. Reports from the Medical Staff Executive Committees
i. Provident Hospital of Cook County
ii. John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County
Dr. Pierre Wakim, President of the Executive Medical Staff (EMS) of Provident Hospital of Cook County,
presented his report. The EMS met on Friday, April 5th; additionally the quarterly Medical Staff Dinner was
held yesterday. At the meetings, an information technology update was provided; there were no quality
issues presented. Dr. Wakim indicated that the Emergency Medicine yearly update is scheduled to be
presented at the Provident Joint Conference Committee Meeting scheduled for later that morning. He noted
that staff is trying to rejuvenate the working group committee that was previously in place for the purpose of
discussing the best way to utilize resources at Provident Hospital.
With regard to the Bylaws of the Medical Staff of Provident Hospital of Cook County, Dr. Wakim stated
that they are complete. They were sent to the State’s Attorney’s Office; EMS will need to convene one
more time; following that activity, it is expected that the complete changes will be brought to this
Committee for approval.
Dr. Ozuru Ukoha, President of the EMS of Stroger Hospital of Cook County, presented his report. He stated
that the EMS met yesterday. A report was received from the Medical Records Committee. He stated that
the goals of that Committee remain; the goals are to improve the documentation for the purpose of
communication, regulatory requirement, and now billing. He stated that avoiding delinquencies is an issue.
It is recognized that there is a need to somehow disseminate information regarding delinquencies well before
the chart becomes delinquent; this is an ongoing chronic issue, but it is recognized and efforts are being
made to address the issue.
