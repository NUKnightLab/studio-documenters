Delinquent Taxes - Lien - Notice - Force and Effect of Lien - Release

If any local services tax imposed by this Ordinance is not paid when due, the County Treasurer

the time of the filing, the amount set forth in the certificate also constitutes a lien upon all property of the
taxpayer then owned by him or thereafter acquired by him in the period before the expiration of the lien.
Such liens have the same force, effect and priority as a judgment lien and continue for 10 years from the
date of the recording unless sooner released or otherwise discharged. The County Treasurer may, at any
time, release all or any portion of the property subject to any lien provided for in this Ordinance or
subordinate the 1ien to other liens if he determines that the taxes are sufficiently secured by a lien on other
property of the taxpayer or that the release or subordination of the lien will not endanger or jeopardize the
collection of taxes.

*Deferred at the Personnel Compliance Committee Meeting of 10/ 10/00.

Chai rman Moran stated that letters were received from the Bureau of Health Services and the Bureau of
Human Resources and should be placed in the record.
Commissioner Hansen asked ifthere was a representati ve from the Bureau of Health Services?
Chairman Moran responded that there was no one present from the Bureau of Health Services.
Commissioner Hansen asked for a response from Mark Kilgallon regarding Ruth Rothstei n' s req uest that
the Board consider a provision that wo uld pennit the Bureau of Health Services to waive the res idency
requirement fo r categories of workers who are in short supply.
Mark Ki lgallon, Chief, Bureau of Human Resources, stated that he had spoken to Ruth Rot hstein and she
has asked that the waiver req uest be withdrawn.
Commissioner Hansen s uggested to the C hairman that Ruth Rothstein should put this new info rmation in
writing. He further said he favors the proposal s ponsored by Commissioner Sutker and he asked fo r the
deferral at the last meeting in order to receive more detailed information.
Mark Kilgall on stated that he wi ll get the request in writing.
Mark Kil gallon stated that the Bureau of Human Resources oversees approximately fifteen thousand of
the County's employees, which means that an add itional twelve thousand employees do not come under
the jurisdiction of the Bureau. He commented that his statements regardi ng Cook County hiri ng practices
only pertain to about sixty plus percent of the total number of employees. He further stated that elected
offi cial s have been notified of today's meeting and were asked to attend the meeting to address any
questions or concerns regard ing the proposed ordinance. He stated that he wanted to make it c lear that he
is only speaking for those departments under the President and the Bureau of Health Services, and not a
large part of the County that is not overseen by the Bureau of Human Resources.

11 9

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 5, 2000
Mr. Kilgallon stated that the Bureau of Human Resources surveyed a number of jurisdictions including
collar counties, and the majority of the counties do not have a residency ordinance. Will and McHenry
counties, however, do have ordinances.
Mr. Kilgallon further said the Bureau of Human Resources does not know what the impact the ordinance
will have on Cook County. He stated the Bureau will be able to do some analysis but because of the size
of the Cook County and its diversity, Human Resources cannot make the assumption that there will be
problems because some other jurisdictions are having problems. He continued by saying Human
Resources did a quantitative analysis on what impact the ordinance would have if everyone agreed to
move back into Cook County, and the assumption is there would not be an impact. However, if one
person does not move back into Cook County because of the residency requirement, then there still would
be a cost factor whether it means going to the second person on the eligibility list or whether it means
reposting and possibly doing more testing that would result in a fiscal impact to the county.
He stated that the fact of having county employees supporting county businesses, supporting county
schools, paying property taxes and living in the county, and benefits that have a financial gain to Cook
County.
Commissioner Hansen asked ifthere are articles or studies that have been done on the proposed residency
ordinance?
Mark Kilgallon responded that the Bureau of Human Resources is seeing some problems, which is one of
his concerns. He said the Bureau has not seen positive stories, and the county would have to look at other
jurisdictions that are having success with resindecy requirements.
Commissioner Hansen stated that a well-written aiticle will look at both sides of the matter-the cost
benefits and the cost disadvantages.
Mark Kilgallon stated he has one article he will distribute to the committee that addresses Commissioner
Hansen's request.
Commissioner Hansen asked what is the position of the administration on the residency ordinance?
Mark Kilgallon responded that the administration supports the ordinance.
Commissioner Carr stated that the residency ordinance will have an impact on the county, and it is tough
when someone makes his or her living in Cook County and pays taxes elsewhere. Personally, he stated
that the ordinance is not a bad thing.
Mark Kilgallon stated that anyone who applies for a position with the City of Chicago, must show that
they are a resident of the City of Chicago, which could limit recruitment. Mr. Kilgallon stated that the
State's Attorney's Office needs to look at the present language on the County's ordinance. He further
stated that he believes it would still allow the county to recruit from outside the county as long as they
have an established residency in Cook County by the time of employment. He continued by say ing that
occasionally a national search would need to be done for an expert and there currently is no stipulation in
the ordinance. The City of Chicago allows several months for new employees to establish residency
within the City after they are selected by a committee for specific positions. The residency ordinance
before the committee does not indicate those specifics and would be subject to interpretation on when it
actually goes into effect-whether by application or by employment.

120

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 5, 2000
Commissioner Hansen asked if there is language amending the ordinance to allow a period of time for an
employee to move into Cook County?
Mark Kilgallon stated that he can provide the committee with language, but the amendment has not been
discussed with the sponsor of the ordinance.
Commissioner Sutker stated that as sponsor of the ordinance, his intention was that residency would be
required upon employment and not upon application. He stated that Section 3 in the ordinance clearly
states the provision. He also said that Cook County wants a commitment from County employees as part
of their employment. Commissioner Sutker read portions of a Chicago Tribune newspaper article in
support of the proposed ordinance into the record.
Commissioner Butler stated he believes the reason for the proposed ordinance is because there are
employees who work for Cook County and live outside the county who are not paying property taxes. He
suggested a better idea would be to have a Cook County Employment Tax. He stated he finds it difficult
to tell people where they must li ve in order to be employed. He closed by saying that the ordinance is bad
policy and it destroys the concept of a regional form of government.
Commissioner Hansen restated his earlier requests. He concluded by saying that if the administration
believes the ordinance should include a contingency to allow employees a period of time to move into
Cook County, the commissioners should receive the suggested language before the board meeting.
Commissioner Moreno stated he agrees with Commissioner Butler, but he thinks the ordinance is not
necessary and believes the county can scrutinize employment applications no matter where the applicant
resides, provided they are qualified.
Commissioner Sims stated that the county should look at making exceptions and amendments if the
county begins to loose valuable employees or highly qualified applicants. The commissioner said she
believes the county should " leave the door open."

Commissioner Hansen moved approval of Item 235458, seconded by Commissioner Carr.
Commissioner Hansen called for a Roll Call, the votes of yeas and nays being as follows:

CITY OF BLUE ISLAND (NO CASH BID REQUEST). Transmitting a Communication,
dated June 13, 2000 from Deborah Sims, Chairman, Tax Delinquency Subcommittee,
submitting a request from Donald E. Peloquin, Mayor:
Re: City of Blue Island

123

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 5, 2000
I am writing to you on behalf of the residents of the City of Blue Island. We are requesting
your assistance in securing tax delinquent properties on a no cash bid basis from the county
scavenger sale. These properties have been an eyesore for the residents that live next to them
for years. Our building department has tried numerous times to contact the property owner to
no avail. Some of the lots will be used for single family housing and we have a contractor
interested in building on the lots. We are also trying to secure an abandoned restaurant/store
which is in need of repair. The city would be seeking a RFP in regards to selling or giving
this property to an entity. My staff and I believe that a small grocery/deli store would be the
most productive use of the property. Two additional lots adjacent to a local church, would be
used for both commuter and church parking.
The City of Blue Island will retain legal counsel to obtain the tax deed and will bear all legal
and other costs associated with acquisition of the parcels.

Re:

Bond Volume Cap Allocation for Mortgage Credit Certificates

Requesting approval of a Resolution to allocate portions of the County's 2000 Bond Volume Cap, in the
amount of $525,000.00 to the Illinois Housing Development Authority (IHDA) for the purpose of
administering a Mortgage Credit Certificate Program for suburban Cook County by December 31, 2000
in order to prevent a lapse in the bond cap authority for 2000. A lapse in bond cap authority would mean
the permanent loss of $525,000.00 to the County unless the bond cap is transferred to lHDA for the stated
purpose.
The Mortgage Credit Certificate (MCC) program allows first-time home buyers a federal income tax
credit of 25% to 50% (up to $2,000.00) of their mortgage interest a direct federal income tax credit every
year. The remaining mortgage interest may be deducted in the usual manner. A tax credit is a dollar-fordollar reduction in the tax due, not just a deduction from gross income. A MCC holder is allowed to take
tax credit each year, so long as the holder continues to live in the home for which the MCC was issued .
The MCC program eliminates the need to issue bonds and the large costs associated with such issuances.
The Department of Planning and Development coordinates and administers several housing programs.
The MCC is an opportunity to expand home ownership in coordination with the HOME Investment
Partnership Program activities, particularly to encourage new home construction in redevelopment areas.
The lllinois Housing Development Authority has administered the County's MCC program since 1994
using all of the County's allocation and addition !HOA allocations in suburban Cook at no administrative
cost to the County. The Mortgage Credit Certificate Program is available Countywide.
