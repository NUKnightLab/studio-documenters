PROJECTS
640 Temple Brownfield Redevelopment Plan
Mr. Vosburg presented the 640 Temple Brownfield Plan. PowerPoint slides provided
maps and renderings of the project. The development team provided additional
information regarding the project’s intended use and the history of the project site.
Project Introduction
Temple Group Holdings, LLC is the project developer (the “Developer”) for the Plan which
entails the redevelopment of the current 169,337-square foot commercial building located
at 640 Temple Street and the adjacent vacant lot. The redevelopment encompasses
several components including 100-room key boutique hotel and hotel auxiliary facilities,
a restaurant and banquet facility, 70 residential apartments and a lounge/night club.
The Property is located in Detroit’s Cass Park Historic District, on the west side of Detroit,
on the block bounded by Charlotte Street to the north, Second Avenue to the east, Temple
Street to the south and Third Avenue to the west.
The total investment is estimated to be $65 million. The Developer is requesting
$6,455,496.00 in TIF reimbursement, however only $5,100,380 in TIF Reimbursement is
projected to be captured for the life of the Plan.

 There will be 158 Temporary construction jobs and 80 FTE jobs. The 80 FTE are expected
to be created over a 3 year period, once construction begins. The FTE jobs will include
managerial positions, housekeeping and janitorial staff, wait staff and desk attendants.
Property Subject to the Plan
The eligible property (the “Property”) consists of four (4) parcels located at 640,650,660
and 674 Temple Street bounded by Charlotte Street to the north, Second Avenue to the
east, Temple Street to the south and Third Avenue to the west in Detroit’s Cass Park
Historic District.
Basis of Eligibility
The property is considered “eligible property” as defined by Act 381, Section 2 because
(a) the property was previously utilized for a commercial purpose; (b) it is located within
the City of Detroit, a qualified local governmental unit under Act 381; and (c) the Property
is determined to be a facility as defined by Act 381.
Eligible Activities and Projected Costs
The “eligible activities” that are intended to be carried out at the Property are considered
“eligible activities” as defined by Sec 2 of Act 381, because they include department
specific activities, site preparation, infrastructure improvements, demolition, lead and
asbestos abatement and development of a brownfield plan and work plan. The eligible
activities and budgeted costs are intended as part of the development of the Property and
will be financed solely by the Developer. The Authority is not responsible for any costs
of eligible activities and will incur no debt. The eligible activities are estimated to begin in
the spring/summer of 2018 and be completed within eighteen (18) months.
Tax Increment Financing (TIF) Capture
The Developer desires to be reimbursed for the costs of eligible activities. Tax increment
revenue generated by the Property will be captured by the DBRA and used to reimburse
the cost of the eligible activities completed on the Property after approval of this Plan
pursuant to the terms of a Reimbursement Agreement with the DBRA.
