Commissioner Karim opened the meeting at 6:00pm

The agenda was approved

The minutes of the March meeting were approved.

The commissioners reviewed the three responses to the RFP seeking an
event planner for the Summer Festival. We received submissions from
Artworks Chicago, Chicago Special Events and Command Attention. After a
discussion of pricing, experience and talent opportunities, the commissioners
chose Chicago Special Events to run the festival. Looking ahead, we will look
to hire an intern to assist with the process. We will also hold a debrie?ng
meeting in September, which will be the time we draft the RPF for the 2018
event. This should get us off to an earlier start.

The March statements are not yet available. We currently have over
$250,000 in the bank. We received $504,204 from the City, plus a $133,000
carryover from last year.

Con?ict of interest statements are due in May. The terms of three
commissioners, Kareem, Jackson and Hurt expire in April. They are expected
to be renewed in May.

The SSA #42 website was reviewed. Several wording and design elements
were revised and approved.

The murder of several people in the past few days shows we still have a
serious security issue. We still need to get Walgreens to clean up their act
and be more proactive in cleaning up their property. We will ask Allpoints if
varying their patrol times will help.

There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned at 7:07pm.
