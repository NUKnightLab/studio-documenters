Upon the timely request of any party to the proceeding, any person, who the
administrative law officer determines may reasonably be expected to provide testimony which is material
and which does not constitute a needless presentation of cumulative evidence, shall be made available for
cross-examination prior to a final determination of liability.
(k)
The record of all hearings before an administrative law officer shall include: (i) a record
of the testimony presented at the hearing, which may be made by tape recording or other appropriate

10

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 14, 2010
means; (ii) all documents presented at the hearing; (iii) a copy of the notice of violation or notice of
hearing; and (iv) a copy of the findings and decision of the administrative law officer.
(l)
Upon conclusion of a hearing, the administrative law officer shall issue a final
determination of liability, or no liability, or supervision. Upon issuing a final determination of liability the
administrative law officer may: (i) impose penalties and/or fines that are consistent with applicable
provisions of the County Code or a department's official fine schedule; (ii) issue orders that are consistent
with applicable provisions of the County Code; and/or (iii) assess costs reasonably related to instituting
the administrative adjudication proceeding; provided, however, that in no event shall the administrative
law officer have the authority to impose a penalty of imprisonment or, except in cases to enforce the
collection of any tax imposed and collected by the County, where this limitation shall not apply, impose a
fine in excess of that authorized by the Code, exclusive of costs of enforcement.
(m)
In the issuance of a final determination of liability, an administrative law officer shall
inform the respondent of his or her right to seek judicial review of the final determination.
(n)
Where the respondent stipulates to facts supporting the charge in the citation and agrees
to pay the fines, penalties, and costs provided by law, the hearing officer may defer both (i) further
proceedings and (ii) entry of a finding of liability, and enter an order for supervision of the respondent
where the hearing officer, after considering the circumstances of the offense, and the history, character
and condition of the offender, is of the opinion that:
(1)

The offender is not likely to commit further ordinance violations,

(2)

The defendant and the public would be best served if the defendant were not have a
record of liability, and

(3)

In the best interests of justice an order of supervision is more appropriate than a finding
of liability, permitted under this Code.

(o)
As a condition of supervision the hearing officer shall enter an order setting a period of
time, not to exceed six months, for the respondent to pay the fines, penalties, and costs provided by law.
Upon payment of the fines, penalties, and costs, the citation shall be dismissed with a finding of no
liability. If the respondent fails to make the payment, within the period set out in the order, a finding of
liability shall be entered against the respondent based on the respondent’s stipulation. Upon the finding of
liability, fines, penalties, and costs provided by law shall be assessed against the respondent.
Effective date: This Amended Ordinance shall be in effect immediately upon adoption.

exempt from any limitations on funds appropriated to the 100 accounts in the County’s Resolution and
Annual Appropriation Bill; and
WHEREAS, Section 38-83 of the Enabling Ordinance further provides that after approval of each

Health System to lease capital equipment through an operating lease as opposed to acquisition through
financing by a bond issuance by the County; and
WHEREAS, the Health System wishes to lease capital equipment for 2011 through its Master Lease

WHEREAS, the Health System receives funds from various granting agencies and wishes to continue to
approve new grants, renewals or amendments to existing grants and receive these grant funds without

Appropriation Bill for Fiscal Year 2011.

A RESOLUTION IN SUPPORT OF RESTORATION OF CLEAN WATER ACT PROTECTIONS
WHEREAS, as County officials we are tasked with protecting the health, safety, and welfare of our
citizens and see first-hand the importance of protecting clean water and healthy watersheds to ensure
clean and safe drinking water supplies and outdoor recreation; and to protect bridges, roads, hospitals,
treatment plants, and other critical infrastructure necessary for the future sustainability of our
communities; and
WHEREAS, the 1972 Clean Water Act has played a central role in maintaining and restoring clean water
and healthy watersheds, and for nearly thirty years virtually all natural surface waters were recognized as
“waters of the United States” and protected from pollution and destruction; and
WHEREAS, the effectiveness of the Clean Water Act is threatened by two recent Supreme Court
decisions, Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (SWANCC) in
2001 and Rapanos v. United States in 2006, where congressional intent was ignored and the scope of
waters covered by the Act was narrowly interpreted, putting in doubt pollution safeguards for many vital
wetlands, lakes and streams; and
WHEREAS, according to the National Wildlife Federation, at least 823 polluting facilities with pollution
controls established by Clean Water Act permits are located on at-risk Illinois streams; if these streams
lose Clean Water Act protections, federal permits will no longer be necessary and the facilities will be
able to pollute at will; and
WHEREAS, Cook County has already experienced significant damage from increased flooding, surface
water pollution and other problems caused by the lack of Clean Water Act enforcement; clean and safe
drinking water supplies are of particular concern; and

19

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 14, 2010
WHEREAS, the protection of our small streams and wetlands will reduce this flooding in our
communities, preserve essential fish and wildlife habitat which support Illinois’ recreation industry and
help restore and maintain the biological integrity of our watersheds.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that given the critical need to restore protections for our
nation’s waters, the Cook County Board of Commissioners joins the National Association of Counties
and our county colleagues across the country in support of restoring the protections of the Clean Water
Act to their status prior to the SWANCC decision; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board urges the Obama Administration to
restore and clarify Clean Water Act protections, including for so-called isolated wetlands, by proposing
for public comment and then finalizing a revised definition of “waters of the United States” that restores
and clarifies these protections in a manner that is consistent with both the law and the science; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a suitable copy of this Resolution be tendered to President Obama
and the Chair of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, Nancy Sutley and let it also be
spread upon the official proceedings of this Honorable Body.

OFFICE OF THE COUNTY ASSESSOR
PROPOSED CONTRACT
The following item was deferred at the November 16, 2010 Board Meeting:
Transmitting a Communication, dated November 9, 2010 from
JAMES M. HOULIHAN, Cook County Assessor
by
JOHN M. FALLON, Chief Deputy Assessor
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with Cook County Suburban
Publishers, Inc. Chicago, Illinois, for publication of the state mandated publications as follows; proposed
assessed values for the 2011 real estate triennial assessment of the South Townships outside the city of
Chicago; revisions made to the 2011 triennial assessment in South Townships outside the city of Chicago,
after publication of the initial triennial assessment publication; 2011 triennial assessment list in additional
newspapers for additional public notification as directed by the Assessor's Office; revisions made to the
2011 real estate non-triennial assessment of North Townships outside the city of Chicago; and revisions

77

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 14, 2010
made as a consequence of the change in assessment practices to the 2010 real estate assessment of North
townships outside the city of Chicago.
Reason:

Cook County Suburban Publishers, Inc. has been the sole-source vendor for the publication of
Cook County's suburban townships assessment list since 2002. Prior to 2002, this same
entity published the assessment list for many years. During this time, prior to 2002, Cook
County Suburban Publishers, Inc. was the only vendor to submit a response when the annual
contract was sent out to bid. State statutes (35ILCS 200/12-20 and 715 ILCS 10/1 et seq.)
impose strict guidelines as to who may publish the assessment list for Cook County's
suburban townships. Therefore, due to the timely nature of publishing the assessment list, the
Assessor's Office requests that this contract be sole-sourced to Cook County Suburban
Publishers, Inc.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $597,441.28. Contract period: May 1, 2011 through April 30, 2012. (040-240
Account). Requisition No. 10400003.
Approval of this item would commit Fiscal Year 2011 funds.

COOK COUNTY HEALTH & HOSPITALS SYSTEM
PROPOSED GRADE 24 SALARY ADJUSTMENTS
The following item was deferred at the December 1, 2010 Board Meeting:
Transmitting a Communication dated November 22, 2010

92

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 14, 2010
WARREN L. BATTS, Chairman, Cook County Health & Hospitals System Board
and
WILLIAM T. FOLEY, Chief Executive Officer, Cook County Health & Hospitals System
In light of the recognition of Resolution 10-R-03 approved and adopted December 1, 2009 by the Cook
County Board of Commissioners regarding the adjustment of any Grade 24 positions we are presenting
the following Grade 24 adjustments:
Oak Forest Hospital Deputy Director
Shirley Bomar-Cole
$125,313.76 - $131,579.44
Promotion: This equity adjustment was based on an assignment to Oak Forest Hospital in 2005. Ms.
Cole was part of an interim team and promised a raise if made permanent. The position was made
permanent but she never received the promised increase.
Oak Forest Hospital, Provident Hospital and ACHN Chief Financial Officer
John Cookinham
$125,000.00- $165,000.00
Error Adjustment: An error was made in the compensation when Mr. Cookinham was re-hired. This
adjustment moved him to the level he was paid when he left the hospital two years ago and also
reflects expanded System responsibilities.
Oak Forest Hospital Associate Administrator
Thomas Dohm
$88,949.12 - $114,093.00
Re-classification: This reflects a promotion to Associate Administrator and was part of the
realignment at Oak Forest Hospital. The new organizational structure at Oak Forest Hospital presents
a savings.
System Chief Psychologist
Rocco Domanico
$85,467.20 - $95,382.56
Promotion: This reflects a promotion to Vice Chair of the Department of Psychiatry, assisting the
Chair in the general oversight, direction, and management for the Department.
Oak Forest Hospital Chief Operating Officer
Sylvia Edwards
$156,526.24 - $161,120.96
Promotion: An equity adjustment was given based on a comparison between the position of Chief
Operating Officers at both Provident and Oak Forest Hospitals. It was determined that the Chief
Operating Officer at Oak Forest Hospital was performing the same job as the Chief Operating Officer
of Provident Hospital but at lower pay rate.
System Director of Talent Management
Gina Goodson-Allen
$100,000.00 - $120,000.00
Promotion: This individual applied for the position of System Director of Talent Management. She
was promoted from Nurse Recruiter to this new position with responsibility for all recruiting
including Taleo.
Ruth M. Rothstein Core Center Pharmacist Manager
Richard Grant
$129,538.24 - $134,706.00
Data base correction: This does not reflect a change in salary. There was a problem with the set-up
of their payroll which has been corrected.
The adjustments to the Grade 24 positions will be funded from the 110 Account. Pursuant to Resolution
09-R-526 the System Board has authority to transfer funds in and out of the 100 Services Accounts

93

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 14, 2010
