New Business/Other Comments
Campaign Finance Policy:
Discussion held regarding a policy proposal regarding the request of bank statements with
Campaign Finance filings. In accordance with ORC Title 35, the CCBOE must accept and
process all campaign finance filings pursuant to the rules and regulations defined in the ORC, the
Ohio Secretary of State, the Ohio Elections Commission, and other applicable law. To audit the
required filings in a more thorough and expeditious manner, the CCBOE will ask, but not
mandate, all entities filing campaign finance reports to include non-redacted bank statement(s)
with their required campaign finance filings. Director Perlatti stated the proposed policy would
be a uniform policy and that no one would be singled out. The Prosecutor’s office has reviewed
the proposed policy and is in agreement. Chairman Hastings stated he is in agreement with the
proposed policy and will have some amendments and thereafter will resend to all for final
review.
Director Perlatti stated all polls were open and ready at 6:30 am and currently we are expecting a
7% turnout.
