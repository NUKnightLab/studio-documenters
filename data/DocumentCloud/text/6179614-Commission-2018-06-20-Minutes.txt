A5 Branding Discussion
Poles for banners:
Brandon counted the poles but didn’t get Ashland portion.
Need count of new poles vs. old poles because of brackets needed.
Need 2 different size banners.
Need to cover secondary businesses including Gateway Center.
Paulina has completely different poles and may not be able to put up banners
on that street.
Bannerville is one of the providers for the banners.
City won’t approve new brackets for new poles but Bannerville might be able to
install padding under brackets.
Photography:
Husband & wife team were discussed.
Cynthia mailed existing Hello Howard photos to A5 if they wanted to use them.
A5 doesn’t think they fit with current branding direction.
1st shoot – June 27th, then July 11th, 13th or 14th.
Picked commissioner-related photo sites – need to cover others in next shoot.
Talk to Recyclery and Gale School.
Photo 6 sites each day for 2 days = 12 sites.

 Howard Street
Having problems with security of the cameras.
There are 3 sites – 4 cameras per site:
Lost Eras
Post Office
Currency Exchange
The cameras are costly but the % of the budget spent on security is minimal.
Should not sunset the security cameras since they have helped solve crimes,
etc. Should instead think about expanding the number of cameras.
Beautification:
The holiday lights have different costs depending on whether they are wrapped
/ unwrapped (to keep lights for next year) or cut down.
Have to jerryrig some lights since there are no close outlets but this is not the
safest.
Do we look at other alternatives?
Do we continue to match Evanston’s lights since they are not coordinating with
Howard St for the branding?
Lights do bring people out, help with security and have mostly positive
feedback from the community.
Final Budget:
Due on 7/13.
SSA Meeting is on 7/11 but need questions ASAP since don’t know when final
budget will be sent out for review.

Community Input
Paul – trees need trimming – call 311; trash receptacles – need more because
the garbage is ending up on the street.
We should consider an annual power wash of the streets.
There is a planter that was destroyed by a car 7 – 8 months ago and it needs to
be replaced.
Can we offer a community service project to help clean the park and
neighborhood? Reach out to Family Matters? Need to contact nearby schools.
The clock is being repaired – it was losing 5 minutes per hour.
