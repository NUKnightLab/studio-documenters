STAFF REPORT 7-10-2019 MEETING
APPLICATION NUMBER 19-6239
ADDRESS: 2542 SEMINOLE
HISTORIC DISTRICT: INDIAN VILLAGE
APPLICANT: JEFF KLEIN
DATE OF STAFF VISIT: 07-03-2019

PREPARED BY: B. CAGNEY

PROPOSAL
The Centennial Garden is located on the corner of Seminole and Charlevoix in the Indian Village Historic
District. It is owned by the Indian Village Historical Collections, a nonprofit owner of the three parcels of
once vacant land that the garden currently occupies. The garden is maintained and operated by the Indian
Village Men’s and Women’s Garden Club. The garden was dedicated in 1995 as the Centennial Garden to
celebrate 100 years of the Indian Village neighborhood. The Centennial garden space is bound by a
black wrought iron fence, with a gated entrance on Seminole street. The existing plan of the formal
garden is based on a High French or Italian Renaissance design: a symmetrical shape with strong axial
nodes and pathways. A focal point for the Centennial Garden is the central wrought-iron gazebo which
was added in 2007, replacing the original wood gazebo. The pathways are crushed gravel and bordered
by manicured hedges, separating the formal garden from open lawn space.
The applicant states that redesign is necessary because the “1995 design called for numerous beds of
annual plants, that cannot be maintained effectively. Also, the original lots were low lying and swampy,
which was not addressed in the original design, as a result the lawn floods and is unusable for most of
the spring despite many corrective actions attempted. Also, fundamentally this was a Victorian garden
design, in a historic neighborhood of arts and crafts or colonial design homes, built post 1900 and
mostly in the tens and twenties. It was an attempt to create something that never would have been
done when the neighborhood was new.”
With the current proposal, the applicant is seeking the Commission’s approval to complete the following
work associated with a new design for the garden as per the attached drawings:
Redesign of the existing non-historic garden:
• The proposed garden utilizes the existing perimeter fence, trellis and gazebo structures
• The plan adds 6 light poles, in the historic “bishop style” as used in Indian Village
• The garden will maintain formal planting areas, but utilize new materials and land forms to
create a more dynamic space
o Walkways will be poured concrete, retaining walls will be closely spaced boulders
• The proposal removes 5 existing trees (3 dead, 2 Norway Maples in poor condition)
• The proposal adds approximately 70 new trees
• The proposed garden layout will feature raised lawns and gardens to address drainage
• The proposed garden layout will add native vegetation that has been selected by a Landscape
Architect for reduced levels of maintenance

 ELEMENTS OF DESIGN- INDIAN VILLAGE
(13)

Relationship of significant landscape features and surface treatment. The typical treatment of individual
properties is a flat front lawn area in grass turf, often subdivided by a walk leading to the front entrance,
and sometimes with a walk at the side leading to the rear. Materials for such walks are concrete, brick, or
stone, or combinations of those materials. Some front yards have rectangular raised earthwork terraces
upon which the house stands. These unpaved terraces have sloping embankments or brick and/or stone
retaining walls at the change of grade. Foundation plantings, often of a deciduous character,
characteristic of the period 1895-1930, are present virtually without exception. Hedges between
properties, and ornamental front yard fences or hedges are not uncommon. The American elm is virtually
extinct in the district, though once the dominant tree. Replacement trees should be characteristic of the
area and period, though only a disease-resistant American elm would be a practical choice. Plantings of
new trees should be directed toward the restoration of the former straight-line rows of large trees on the
front yards and "tree lawns." Straight side driveways leading from the street to rear garages exist, but
alley-facing garages are common, particularly in the southern portion of the district. Where alley-facing
garages are common, the lack of driveways lends a unity to the succession of front lawns. Driveway
materials include concrete, brick and gravel. Side lots are not uncommon in the district, and a number of
these form a part of the original site plan for the residence. Such side lots are usually landscaped, often
fenced at or near the setback line, and very occasionally contain paved areas such as a tennis court. The
street right-of-way of eighty (80) feet combined with a pavement width of between twenty-four (24) and
twenty-nine (29) feet creates wide "tree lawns" or berm areas, which adds to the generous ambience of
the urban landscape of the district. Street pavements are now asphalt; cut stone curbs still exist in
portions of the district. Alleys are frequently paved with brick, particularly where alley facing garages are
common. Fencing ranges widely in type; fencing in public view was generally designed to compliment
the style, design material, and date of the residence.

(14)

Relationship of open space to structures. Open space in the district occurs in the form of vacant land, a
city park, school yards for the Waldorf and Nichols Schools, and side lots. Where an original or early
arrangement of a house and grounds included and still includes landscaped lots which form part of the
landscaping plan for the residence, such landscaped lots are significant landscape features.

(22)

General environmental character. The Indian Village District, with its long, straight streets, its hierarchy
of walls of continuity (lamps, trees, buildings) and its large, dignified homes, has an urban, substantial,
low density residential character.

RECOMMENDATION
The project is appropriate because it does not destroy any historic materials on site. There are aspects of this proposal
that conform to the elements of design for the neighborhood, such as materiality of the concrete walks and the design
of the proposed lighting. However, the elements of design for planting new trees and other proposed landscape
material is somewhat limited, as it states “Replacement trees should be characteristic of the area and period, though
only a disease-resistant American elm would be a practical choice. Plantings of new trees should be directed toward
the restoration of the former straight-line rows of large trees on the front yards and "tree lawns." The current proposal
varies from this element of design significantly, as many more species of trees are proposed for the garden. This
biodiversity is typically a positive aspect when planting trees, as it less likely all trees could die if one species gets a
disease.
It is staff’s opinion that this project is appropriate based on the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation
Number 9) New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials that
characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the
massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment.
