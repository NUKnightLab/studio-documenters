PROPOSED ORDINANCE
THE COOK COUNTY SOCIAL ENTERPRISE ORDINANCE
WHEREAS, nonprofit organizations serving the residents of Cook County and its environs are becoming
increasingly entrepreneurial, supplementing charitable donations and foundation and government grants
with revenue earned by the businesses they own and run, instrumentalities of mission in their own right;
and
WHEREAS, for-profit social-purpose businesses serving the residents of Cook County and its environs
are defining success in terms of both financial and social returns.

services to disadvantaged people or by employing disabled or disadvantaged people.
(b) The County finds that social enterprises use earned revenue strategies to generate income and
thus become more self-sustaining.

they are for-profit entities which are legally required to have a purpose of creating a general public benefit
and may also have the purpose of creating specific public benefits.
(d) The County finds that Illinois low-profit limited liability companies are social enterprises by virtue
of the fact that they are for-profit entities which must at all times significantly further the accomplishment
of one or more charitable or educational purposes as defined by the Internal Revenue Code.
