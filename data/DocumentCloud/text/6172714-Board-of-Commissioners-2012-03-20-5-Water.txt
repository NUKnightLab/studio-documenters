GENERAL BACKGROUND
Daniel Hudson Bumham Apartments (?Burnham Apartments?) is a 181-unit senior housing building
located at 1930 West Loyola in Chicago, Illinois. The building was constructed in 1984. Shortly after
construction, the building began to experience water in?ltration issues, and those issues have persisted
over the course of the building?s life. The CHA has contracted with a number of design and
construction ?rms over the years to eliminate the problems. While the problem has been mitigated by
these efforts, water in?ltration has not been completely eliminated.

In 2011, the CHA engaged the architectural ?rm of Holabird Root to investigate the in?ltration
issues. Through exploratory demolition of several exterior wall assemblies, including window
assemblies, the parties discovered areas around the window assemblies that lack suf?cient ?ashing, a
water-impermeable barrier that prevents moisture from entering the interior of the building.

Prior investigations had not uncovered this issue. The prior design and construction ?rms believed the
in?ltration problems centered on the building?s facade and air conditioner openings, While these
investigations did lead to a reduction in water in?ltration, problems still remained. These prior
investigations did not focus on the window assembly itself as did Holabird Root?s investigation.

Holabird Root, under the supervision of the CHA, designed a solution that includes additional
?ashing at the intersection of the window assembly and brick facade. The parties then conducted
extensive water spray testing to assess the solution?s effectiveness. The results indicate the solution
will eliminate any remaining water in?ltration.

The existing windows are at the end of their useful life. So, rather than removing the existing window
assemblies, implementing the solution, then reinstalling the current windows, CHA staff believes the
process should include the installation of new windows. The following is a comparison of the options:

'30 Option A
I Replace the window system in the entire building (windows, receptors, ?ashing and
caulking)

0 Advantages
0 New window system with a 15-year warranty
0 Quicker installation process
0 Less time consuming to demolish and replace than to demolish, salvage and reinstall
Easier and quicker to install a new window assembly
- Disadvantages
0 Higher construction cost: $1,700,000
0 Long lead time for new windows

6ft} Van Baron Sires-t- nan-sex 5.32 ~12 4915351? EEK-EM

 Option 
I Remove existing window assemblies
I Inject expandable foam to seal any holes in the ?ashing
Reinstall existing windows
I Apply new caulking
0 Advantages
0 Lower construction cost: $1,100,000
0 Disadvantages
0 Long installation time frame
0 Higher standard of care required at demolition to salvage, and reinstall existing
window assembly
0 Potential damage to existing window assembly
0 Added costs for new window replacement in the near future (next 1 to 2 years) 
approximately $1.4 

A third option of deferring action until the existing windows are further beyond their useful life would
likely lead to continuing in?ltration, and an inability to lease units with the problem, only to have to
replace the windows in the next two years at or above current construction pricing.

RECOMMENDATION

For these reasons, CHA staff recommends Option A below:

- Recommended engineering option to eliminate water in?ltration (see Holabird Root Water
In?ltration Investigation Report, dated 8/11/2011)
Quicker demolition and installation process
Minimize disturbance and inconvenience to the residents
Extend useful life of the building
Eliminate Slip Hazards
Increase the value of the property
Meets Plan for Transformation objective of introducing private sector real estate principles to
CHA projects

The work will include, but not be limited to the following:

removing all existing windows;

installing a new window system to include windows, receptors. ?ashing and caulking;
removing all existing air conditioning units;

re-installing existing air conditioning units using new shims, gaskets and sealants; and
restoring interior ?nishes damaged during demolition and construction.

The construction duration will be eight (8) months. It will be involve phasing but no relocation of the
residents. During phasing, the General Contractor will a) work in occupied units, b) work in tiers from
top to bottom, c) work on multiple tiers at a time, and d) perform the majority of the work from the
exterior of the building. The General Contractor will coordinate construction activities with the Private
Property Manager on a tier-by-tier basis to keep the residents aware of the work performed in their
units.

PROCUREMENT HISTORY
The CHA advertised Invitation for Bid (IFB) No. 11 - 00854 on December 5, 2011. The IFB was
advertised in the Chicago Sun-Times, the Chicago Defender, Extra, on the CHA website and on
BuySpeed Online. The Pre-Bid meeting and the Site Visit were held on December 13, 2011. One (1)
addendum was issued for this solicitation on December 23, 2011 to respond to Requests for
Information, and distribute several updated Bid Form pages. The CHA received and opened four (4)
bids on January 6, 2012.

After performing an initial review of the bid submittal materials, the Department of Procurement and
Contacts (Procurement) and the Capital Construction Department (CCD) held a pre-award
survey/clari?cation meeting with the apparent low bidder, Friedler Construction Co. The
representatives of that ?rm responded to questions on the thoroughness of their bid, how they
developed their Division Costs, the amount of work they planned to self-perform, the method they
would use to remove old windows and install new models, and how they would handle work in
occupied units. A Compliance Specialist reviewed the ?rm?s compliance materials in detail.

Friedler Construction Co.?s past experience includes satisfactory completion of general modi?cation
projects at Cabrini Row Homes and Phase 1 of Dearbom Homes. The total value of their business with
the CHA since 2007 is 44,226,592. In recent General Contractor (GC) Performance Evaluations,
Friedler earned a 2.0 on a 3.0 evaluation scale. This is a ?Satisfactory? evaluation score. Their
?nancial history shows an excellent Dun Bradstreet score with a healthy set of fmancials. The
contractor has committed to at least one (1) total Section 3 hire as an admin/?eld clerk and is
committed to working with the CI-IA to increase the number.

Having completed its review of the bid materials of the apparent low bidder, the staff of the Capital
Construction Department and Asset Management recommend that Friedler
Construction Co. be awarded a contract for this work. Procurement has completed its own review of
the bid materials and and recommendation and has determined that Friedler Construction
Co. is the lowest responsive and responsible bidder at $1,703,800.00.

CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, the CCD and AM recommend that the Board of Commissioners authorize the
Chief Executive Of?cer or his designee to enter into a contract with Friedler Construction Co. in the
amount of $1,703,800.00 for building envelope improvements to eliminate water in?ltration at Daniel
Hudson Bumham Apartments, a Senior housing development located at 1930 West Loyola Avenue in
Chicago, IL. Work is to be completed by no later than two hundred forty (240) calendar days from the
date set forth in the Notice to Proceed.

This award is subject to the Contractor?s compliance with the Section 3
resident hiring, and bonding and insurance requirements.
