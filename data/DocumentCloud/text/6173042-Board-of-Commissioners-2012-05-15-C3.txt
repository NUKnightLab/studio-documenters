Progr_a_m Histog
The impetus for the HOST program was based on lessons learned from the Chicago Family Case

Management Demonstration Project, which was a collaborative effort between CHA, Urban Institute
and other partners. In the demonstration, improvements were made on nearly every indicator
measured by the Urban Institute including, employment, perception of safety, anxiety, depression, and
engagement with a case manager. The data however, also suggested that the youth in vulnerable
families did not do as well as youth in families who made signi?cant improvements based on the
indicators measured by the original demonstration program. This suggests that speci?c and targeted
approaches for youth are needed in addition to, and separate from, family case management. As a
result, HOST is testing a two-generational model designed to improve famin outcomes for both
vulnerable adults and their children. At its core, HOST aims to address key barriers to economic
independence and self-sufficiency, poor physical and mental health, addiction, low literacy levels, and
a weak connection to the labor force, while simultaneously integrating services for youth that are
designed to break the inter-generational cycle of poverty. These services include clinical intervention
for youth and targeted services that are designed to improve school attendance, performance and social
behavior.

The enhanced services at Altgeld Gardens were initially funded for two (2) years through a $750,000
grant from The Urban Institute, which was awarded from the Open Society Foundation. In February
2011, the Board of Commissioners authorized CHA to accept the initial grant award and for CHA to
partner with its existing case management provider, UCAN, for enhanced case management services,
and Project Match to expand the continuum of youth services for the HOST target population.
Although services through the program at Altgeld Gardens did not begin until August 2011, CHA has
been satis?ed with the performance of both UCAN and Project Match under the HOST demonstration
program thus far.

Progr_am Model Bene?t to Participants
The target population at Altgeld includes a subset of 230 families whose Head of Household was not

working as of August 2011, when the demonstration commenced. The HOST program is designed to
increase literacy, education and employment levels in adults within the target population, and increase
school performance and attendance and improve social skills within the youth in these households.
Providing services tailored to the individual needs of each family member is a key component of the
program. The speci?c metrics that HOST utilizes to achieve these overarching goals includes, but is
not limited to, participants obtaining permanent unsubsidized jobs, participants obtaining their GEDs,
participating in clinical and mental health services, and engaging youth in age appropriate activities
Headstart/Pre-K, childcare, college prep activities, summer jobs, etc.). These metrics are being
monitored throughout the course of the demonstration by the Urban Institute and will be used to assess
the long-term bene?ts of program.

As part of the HOST program, UCAN has decreased the caseload ratio for the HOST participants and
implemented an interdisciplinary team approach focusing on coaching, employment and counseling.
Project Match?s role is to focus on youth services, including its Pathways to Rewards program,
wherein incentives are used to increase desired behavior. Access to early childhood development and
successful youth engagement in school and employment are critical to the success of the families
participating in HOST.

Contractor Bac und

UCAN has provided case management services for families at Altgeld Gardens since the inception of
amilyWorks case management program in 2008. FamilyWorks is comprehensive case
management program that utilizes identi?able outcomes with an intensive concentration on lease
compliance, employment preparation and employment retention. Through this existing relationship
with the families at Altgeld, UCAN has been able to enhance the FamilyWorks services for families on
the HOST caseload.

Project Match provides its incentive based program, Pathways to Rewards, for youth within the HOST
target population. Prior to HOST, in the summer of 2010, Project Match partnered with CHA to
provide developmental delay screenings for the 0-3 year old population at Altgeld Gardens and
referred this population for treatment if a delay in development was diagnosed.

Conclusion

Based upon the foregoing, it is in the best interest of CHA to authorize the Chief Executive Of?cer, or
his designee, to accept a new grant award and amend Grant Agreement No. 08609-000-05-CHA-01
with The Urban Institute in the amount of $287,000 and extend the term of the grant agreement
through April 1, 2014, and amend the sub-grant agreement, Contract No. 11054, with UCAN to
increase the sub-grant?s budget by $95,324 for a new amount not-to-exceed $564,700, and amend the
sub-grant agreement, Contract No. 11055, with Project Match to increase the budget by $191,674, for a
new amount not-to-exceed $462,300, and extend the term of both sub-grant agreements through
September 30, 2013 to continue the HOST demonstration program.
