The next item of business concerned decisions of the Administrative Law
Judge with respect to appeals to Board denials of occupational license

Mr. Johnson moved that the Board adopt the Report of the Administrative

Mr. Johnson seconded the motion. The Chairman called for the yeas and nays.
Leave was granted unanimously by voice vote.
The next order of business concerned the statutory interpretation of the
Riverboat Gambling Act as it related to the placement of a second riverboat in a
location other than a licensee's home docksite. The Chairman recognized Mr.
Gregory Perry representing JoDaviess Joint Venture.
Mr. Perry requested the Board favorably consider allowing licensees to
split licenses. He noted that JDJV wished to place their second vessel in the
City of Peru in LaSalle County. He stated that the statute clearly authorized
the holder of an owner's license to locate 1200 participants notwithstanding
location of the boat because the Board's powers allowed licensing owners but
limited the Board to approving the location of the boat. Mr. Perry said the
Board should approve the request to expand economic development and tourism in
other Illinois communities.
Mr. Michael Ficaro, attorney for Rock Island Boatworks appeared, and
requested favorable consideration to allow license holders to operated two
vessels from separate docksites. He stated that the Board had established a
precedent to split licenses when it approved the inter-governmental agreement
between the cities of East Peoria and Peoria. He noted that part of that
agreement allowed a second gaming vessel to dock permanently in Peoria. Mr.
Ficaro further stated that Rock Island Boatworks was considering seeking
approval to place a second gaming vessel in Decatur, Illinois on the Sangamon
River. Mr. Ficaro stated that it was his opinion that the Act clearly granted
authority to the Board to grant the request.
Mr. Thomas Moore, attorney for Greater Peoria Riverboat Corporation,
appeared and requested the Board deny the requested interpretation. He stated
that approval of the request which would allow JDJV to locate a second vessel in
Peru, Illinois would effect GPRC's plans to introduce a larger vessel. Mr.
Moore urged the Board to maintain the existing interpretation limiting the
number of licenses to ten.
Reverend Tom Grey appeared on behalf of JoDaviess Taxpayer's Association.
He urged the Board to deny the request. He stated that the Association
considered the request of JDJV to locate their second vessel in Peru, Illinois a
breach of promise; that JDJV should maximize their efforts on behalf of the
citizens of JoDaviess County. He said that there was no anticipation ever
expressed that ten licenses equated to twenty locations in Illinois. Mr. Grey
further stated that it appeared that the Board was becoming the "cheerleader"
for the industry.

 Members of the Board asked clarifying questions of the presenters. Mr.
Dennis Triggs, attorney for the City of East Peoria, appeared to clarify the
content of the Intergovernmental agreement between the cities of East Peoria and
Peoria. Reverend Grey suggested that the Board consider allowing an enterprise
move their operation only at license renewal time.
Donna More, responding for staff, told the Board that it was the belief of
staff that the statue did not contemplate owners operating vessels in two
distinct geographical locations. She said that a reading of the entire Act
would support the premise that an owner could have two vessels at the same
location and that specific provisions of the Act more clearly support the staff
position. She noted that the Act allowed a vessel to make intermittent stops
from the home dock of the enterprise when authorized to do so by the Board.
Mr. Johnson moved that the interpretation of
with respect to the Riverboat Gambling Act is that
License is authorized to operate up to 1200 gaming
geographic place, which would be determined as the

the holder of an Owner's
positions from a single
home dock of the licensee.

Under discussion of the motion, the Chairman noted the history of license
considerations. He stated that he agreed with the motion and that he believed
that the Act did not contemplate multiple docksites. Allowing an enterprise to
utilize a temporary docksite had been approved in the past by the Board, but
those actions should not be construed as approving more than one docksite. The
Chairman Kunkle suggested JDJV and Rock Island seek remedy from the General
Assembly. Mr. Johnson reviewed previous Board discussions on the matter as it
related to the four hour cruise limitation. There being no further discussion,
the Chairman called for the yeas and nays by oral roll call, to wit:

The motion was approved 3-0-1.
The next order of business concerned a request from Contract Building
Services to withdraw their application for a Supplier's License.
Mr. Johnson moved the Board grant leave for withdrawal. Mr. Vickrey
seconded the motion. The Chairman called for the yeas and nays.
The motion was approved unanimously by voice vote.
The next order of business concerned a disciplinary action.
Ms. Pyatt moved that the Complaint for Disciplinary Action, DC-93-2,
against Greater Peoria Riverboat Corporation, Paul-Son Dice and Card, Inc., Dale
Burklund, Jeffrey Goldstein, Robert Goldstein, Richard Goldstein and Arnold
Millan be issued. (Ms. Pyatt noted the statutory and regulatory violations
cited in the complaint.) Mr. Johnson seconded the motion.
Under discussion Ms. Pyatt stated that monetary fines were being sought in
the proceeding as follows:
Greater Peoria Riverboat Corporation:

The motion was approved 4-0. The Chairman instructed the Administrator to
issue the Complaint for Disciplinary Action, DC-93-2.
The next item of business concerned other business.
Mr. Johnson asked staff to study and report the impact of floods on the
Mississippi River on casinos. Mr. Friedman reported that while all four
licensees on the Mississippi were in operation, staff would examine the
question.
Mr. Vickrey asked the Administrator to take all steps necessary to protect
public safety during the floods. Mr. Friedman responded that the U.S. Coast
Guard was the proper authority for that purpose. Mr. Vickrey asked that staff
follow-up to make sure the public safety was assured.
Mr. Johnson asked questions about the staff analysis regarding insurance
requirements for licensees. Mr. Hutchison reported that a review of each of the
operators revealed that insurance coverages were either adequate or exceeded
adequate coverage levels as required by Board rules.
Mr. Johnson requested staff poll the members of the Board to set a date
for a Special Meeting during the third week of August to hear license
applications. The Chairman so ordered the staff.

There being no further business to come before the Board, Mr. Johnson
moved the Board stand adjourned. Without objection the Board adjourned at 12:30
P.M.
Respectfully submitted
