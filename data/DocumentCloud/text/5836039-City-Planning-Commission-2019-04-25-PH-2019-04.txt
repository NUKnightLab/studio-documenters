NOTICE OF PUBLIC HEARING

A public hearing will be held by the Detroit City Planning Commission in the Committee of the
Whole Room, 13th Floor, Coleman A. Young Municipal Center, 2 Woodward Avenue, Detroit,
Michigan 48226, on

THURSDAY, APRIL 25, 2019 AT 6:15 PM

to consider the request of Mr. Bernard Butris to amend Article XVII, District Map No. 19 of the
I984 Detroit City Code, Chapter 61, Zoning, by showing a P1 (Open Parking District) zoning
classi?cation where an R1 (Single-family Residential District) and B4 (General Business
District) zoning classi?cation currently exists on three (3) parcels, commonly identi?ed as 5701
E. Eight Mile Road, 20564 and 20576 Syracuse Avenue.

The location of the proposed rezoning is speci?cally indicated as the shaded area on the
accompanying map.

The proposed map amendment is being requested to allow for the expansion of an accessory
parking lot located at 5701 E. Eight Mile Road. The proposed open parking district would be
permitted on a by-right in the proposed P1 zoning classi?cation.

The pertinent zoning district classi?cations are described as follows:
R1 Single-family Residential District

This district is designed to protect and preserve quiet, low-density residential areas now
primarily developed and those areas which will be developed with single-family detached
dwellings and characterized by a high ratio of home ownership. The regulations for this
district are designed to stabilize and protect the essential characteristics of the district and
to promote and encourage a suitable environment for activities associated with family life.
To these ends, deveIOpment is limited to a relatively low concentration and uses permitted
by right are limited to single-family detached dwellings which provide homes for the
residents of the area. Additional residential uses such as religious institutions,
neighborhood centers, and utility uses necessary to serve the immediate area may be
permitted on a conditional basis.

B4 General Business District

The B4 General Business District provides for business and commercial uses of a
thoroughfare-oriented nature. In addition to these uses, other businesses, which may bene?t
by drawing part of their clientele ?'om passing traf?c are permitted. Additional uses, which
may be successfully blended with permitted by?right uses, are conditional.

P1 Open Parking District

This district is designed for off-street parking of private passenger vehicles on property
which abuts, or is separated by an alley or easement from, a non-residential district. The
regulations permit the establishment of parking facilities to serve the non-residential uses,
and at the same time do not permit the non?residential uses themselves to extend into
residential areas. The district will assist in reducing traffic congestion caused by non-
residential uses and at the same time will protect abutting residential areas from the
deleterious effects of adjacent vehicular parking areas.

A Zoning Ordinance map amendment requires approval of the City Council after a public hearing
and after receipt of a report and recommendation by the City Planning Commission. This Zoning
Ordinance map amendment request is being considered consistent with the provisions of Article
111, Division 3 of Chapter 61 of the 1984 Detroit City Code, the Detroit Zoning Ordinance.

You may present your views on this pr0posa1 by attending this hearing, by authorizing others to
represent you, or by writing to this of?ce prior to the hearing; 2 Woodward Avenue, Room 208,
Detroit, Michigan 48226 (FAX: 313-224-4336). Because it is possible that some who are affected
by this preposal may not have been noti?ed, it is suggested that you kindly inform your neighbors
so that they too may express their positions if they so desire.

With advance notice of seven calendar days, the City of Detroit will provide interpreter services
at public meetings, including language translation and reasonable ADA accommodations. Please
contact the Civil Rights, Inclusion and Opportunity Department at 313-224-4950, through the
TTY number 71 1, or email crio@detroitmi.gov to schedule these services.
