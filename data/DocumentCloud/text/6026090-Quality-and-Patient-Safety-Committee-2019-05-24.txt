 Understanding Diabetes

•

This means there is too much sugar in your blood. You may not have
enough of a hormone called insulin.

•

If you have Type 1 diabetes your body can no longer make insulin.

•

If you have Type 2 diabetes your body may still make insulin, but your
cells resist its effects or you cannot make enough insulin.

What are the Complications Associated with Diabetes?

Over time, high blood glucose damages your blood vessels, both large and small.
This damage can lead to complications that affect the whole body. By controlling
your blood glucose, blood pressure and cholesterol according to your treatment

plan, you can help reduce your risk of complications.

Diabetes in CCH in 2019:
•

Numberof diabetic patients: ~ 30,000 to 40,000 This number fluctuates in
different years

•

The number of Pre-Diabetes patients is twice bigger

•

Many have their medical home in ACHN

•

The rest are "orphan patients" using our ED and hospitals for medications and
bad complications

•

At any given moment, at least one third of admitted patient are diabetic

•

Many patients are well controlled but about one third of our patients are poorly
controlled (A1C>9%) with bad complications.

Significance of this study

What is already known about this subject?

Patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes usu-
ally harbor the disease for a few years before being
diagnosed. These patients occasionally present with
complications at the time of diagnosis.

What are the new findings?

In underinsured ethnic minority patients with newly
diagnosed type 2 diabetes, there is a much high-
er prevalence of complications when compared
with insured patients with newly diagnosed type 2
diabetes.

How might these results change the focus of

research or clinical practice?

The changing landscape of health insurance in the
USA may result in less coverage especially for mi-
nority populations resulting in higher risks of compli-
cations at the time of diagnosis of diabetes.

The Network Diabetes Program (NDP): Goal 1
Managing and educating complex patients with Diabetes
•

18 years in existence

•

The NDP teams: (endocrinologists, APNs, PA, Diabetes Educators, Psychologists, Pharm.D).

•

ADA recognized Diabetes Center on central campus and presence in many of the outpatient clinics (Oak Forest,
Prieto, Robbins, Near South, Cicero, Logon, Vista).

•

Special clinics:
• Type 1 groups visits clinic
• Insulin pump clinics
• Multi-disciplinary clinic for patients “failing everything” (MD,CDE, Psych,SW)

• Diabetes classes in English and Spanish
• The Lifestyle Centers (TLC) in main campus and in Oak Forest use a hands-on approach

•

To show and teach patients to improve eating habits, grocery, cooking, eating out, exercise. Results in weight loss that
enables more effective action of insulin and better diabetes control

 The Network Diabetes Program (NDP): Goal 2
Empowerment of primary care providers
• Improve diabetes management through the system
• through yearly updates
• periodic publications

• in-servicing rotations for MDs and Nurses
• diabetes collaboratives
• development of management guidelines on Cerner

• for the inpatient diabetes EMR-based protocols is fully implemented. The program is
supported and supervised electronically by APN-Endocrinologists teams(DQA).

  



Comprehensive Diabetes Care (CDC)

Assesses adults 18-75 years of age with diabetes (type 1 and type 2) who had each of the following:

. Hemoglobin A1c (HbAlc) testing.

. HbA1c poor control 

. HbA1c control 

- HbA1c control for a selected pOpulation. 
0 exam (retinal) performed.

a Medical attention for nephropathy.

- BP control 140f90 mm Hg).

?Additional exclusion criteria are required for this indicator, which will result in a different eligible
population from all other indicators. This indicator is only reported for the commercial and
COOK COUNTY Medicaid product lines.
