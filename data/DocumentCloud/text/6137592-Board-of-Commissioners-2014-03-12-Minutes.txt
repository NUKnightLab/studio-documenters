WHEREAS, Carl Edwin Davis, a man whose life was devoted to social justice, family and faith died February
10, leaving friends, family and a community profoundly enriched for having known him; and
WHEREAS, Carl Davis was a community leader who, as President of the Evanston National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) led voter registration drives, fought for equal employment
opportunity and created a weekly community forum entitled “Get in the Know” that brought together national,
state and local leaders to address issues of concern for the citizens of the region; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Davis freely and generously gave his time to his community, serving on the Evanston
Community Hospital Board, the Board of Trustees of the Second Baptist Church in addition to many others; and
WHEREAS, Carl Davis was a lifelong Evanston resident, attending Evanston public schools and graduating
from Evanston Township High School in 1955. He worked for the City of Evanston until he left to serve his
country in the United States Army in 1959; and
WHEREAS, Carl Davis returned to Evanston after his discharge and became the first black sales associate at
Henry C. Lytton Company and later forged new ground as the first black insurance agent on the North Shore
working with Prudential Insurance Company where he set sales records and was inducted into the Million Dollar
Round Table of the Prudential Insurance Company of America; and
WHEREAS, Carl Davis was a dedicated husband and father. He married Yvonne Nicholas and the two (2) were
the proud parents of two (2) sons, Karl Gregory Davis and Jared Nicholas Davis. He was a doting grandfather to

We Were,” a series of public speaking engagements that focused on the elements that provided Evanstonians of
all races a sense of pride in raising their families in such a diverse community. His grandson Nicholas was his
technical assistant and producer for the series that can still be found on DVD. The series was groundbreaking
and noteworthy not just for documenting “The Way We Were” but for its prescriptive component that pointed out
the way we ought to be.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County, on behalf of
the 5.2 million residents of Cook County commemorates the extraordinary life of Carl Edwin Davis, and herewith

they are situated.
a. A property may be deemed “qualified” for the purpose of the Amended Class 6a if:
i. The retail center with a grocery store component that occupies the premise or retail
development enterprise that will occupy the premise will generate sales tax revenue
through the Retail’s Occupation Tax, the Service Occupation Tax and/or the Use Tax;
and
ii. With regards to the retail center with a grocery store enterprise, the retail center with
a grocery store component that occupies the premises submits evidence of hardship
supporting a determination that the Amended Class 6a designation is necessary for the
retail center with a grocery store component to continue operations at its current location
and maintain its staff, and that without such designation the retail center with grocery

d. If the Ordinance or Resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the County Board is
required to validate such a finding that the property is deemed “qualified” for the purpose of the
Amended Class 6a, and a County Resolution to that effect shall be obtained. The applicant must
present the municipal enabling Ordinance or Resolution obtained in accordance with Section b to
the Board of Commissioners of Cook County prior to its determination as to whether it will
validate such a finding that the property is deemed “qualified” for the purpose of the Amended
Class 6a and provide a County Resolution to that effect. A certified copy of the County
Resolution validating such a finding that the property is deemed “qualified” for the purpose of the
Amended Class 6a need not be filed at the time of filing the Amended Class 6a application with
the Assessor, but must be filed with the Assessor no later than the date an assessment appeal is
filed to request the class change to Amended Class 6a.

Class 6a incentives granted as to the use of the property and the number of persons employed at
the Amended Class 6a site. In such reports, recipients shall be required to certify whether the
retail center with grocery store component or the retail development enterprise continues its
operations at that location. In addition, recipients of Amended Class 6a incentives shall be
required to report to the Assessor within 30 days if the retail center with grocery store component
or the retail development enterprise ceases operations at that location. A copy of such reports
will be forwarded by the Assessor’s Office to the Secretary of the County Board for distribution
to Members of the County Board from the affected districts. Failure to file such reports within
the time established by the Assessor’s rules shall result in loss of the incentive for the period
relating to the non-filing. Additionally, if the retail center with grocery store component or the
retail development enterprise ceases operations at that location, then the Amended Class 6a
incentive granted shall terminate.
f. Class 6a applications for newly constructed of substantially rehabilitated buildings and other
structures must be made to the Assessor within one (1) year prior to the commencement of such
new construction or substantial rehabilitation to qualify for a Class 6a incentive.
g. This classification will begin from date of the notice of approval regarding the retail center
with grocery store component or from the date of such new construction (excluding demolition, if
any) regarding the retail development enterprise and will continue for a period of 12 years or until
the retail center with grocery store component or the retail development enterprise ceases
operations at that location if that occurs sooner.
h. This incentive may be renewed during the last year a property is entitled to a ten percent
assessment level pursuant to Section 74-64(7), if the following requirements are met:
i. The property can continue to be deemed “qualified” for the purposes of the Class 6a;
ii. The applicant notifies the Assessor’s Office of intent to request renewal of the
incentive from the municipality or the County Board, if the real estate is located in an

the property continues to be deemed “qualified” for the purpose of the Amended Class 6a.
j. A copy of the request for renewal of the incentive will be forwarded by the Assessor’s Office
to the Secretary of the County Board for distribution to Members of the County Board from the
affected districts.
k. If no renewal is obtained, the incentive shall be phased out over the next 2 years, pursuant to
Section 74-64(7). After expiration of the last incentive period, the real estate shall revert to the
applicable classification under this Division.
l. The Assessor may adopt rules consistent with this subsection necessary to ensure proper
review of all factors relevant to determine eligibility for the benefits provided under Amended
Class 6a.
(7)(8) Class 6b. Real estate used primarily for industrial purposes, consisting of all newly
constructed buildings or other structures, including the land upon which they are situated; or abandoned
property, including the land upon which such property is situated; or all buildings and other structures
which are substantially rehabilitated to the extent such rehabilitation has added to their value, including
qualified land related to the rehabilitation. Land qualifies when the rehabilitation adds vertical or
horizontal square footage to the improvements. The amount of land eligible for the incentive shall be
in such proportion as the square footage added by the rehabilitation bears to the total square footage of
the improvements on the parcel.
a. An applicant must obtain from the municipality in which the real estate is located or the
County Board if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, an Ordinance or Resolution
expressly stating that the municipality or County Board, as the case may be, has determined that
the incentive provided by Class 6b is necessary for development to occur on that specific real
estate and that the municipality or County Board, as the case may be, supports and consents to the
Class 6b application to the Assessor. A certified copy of the Ordinance or Resolution need not
be filed at the time of filing the Class 6b eligibility application with the Assessor, but must be
filed with the Assessor no later than the date an assessment appeal is filed to request the class
change to Class 6b. If the Resolution is not filed at the time of the eligibility application, the
applicant shall instead file, at that time, a letter from the municipality or the County, as the case
may be, confirming that a Resolution or Ordinance supporting the incentive has been requested.
b. A copy of the Resolution or letter confirming that a Resolution has been requested, whichever
is filed with the application, will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the
County Board for distribution to the Members of the County Board from the affected districts.
c. Class 6b applications for newly constructed or substantially rehabilitated buildings and other
structures must be made to the Assessor within one year prior to the commencement of such new
construction or substantial rehabilitation to qualify for a Class 6b incentive. With respect to
abandoned property, the Class 6b application must be made to the Assessor prior to the
commencement of the reoccupation of the vacant and unused property.
d. In the instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as defined
herein, the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may still determine that special

 Board of Commissioners

Journal - Final

circumstances justify finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purpose of Class 6b,
unless:
1. There has been a purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have not been
vacant and unused prior to such purchase; or
2. There has been no purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have been vacant
and unused for less than 24 continuous months.
The finding of abandonment, along with the specification of the special circumstances, shall be
included in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and consenting to the Class 6b application.
If the Ordinance or Resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the County Board is
required to validate such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class
6b, and a County Resolution to that effect shall be obtained. The applicant must obtain the
municipal enabling Ordinance with the required finding of special circumstances and present such
municipal Ordinance to the Board of Commissioners of Cook County prior to its determination as
to whether it will validate such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of
Class 6b and provide a County Resolution to that effect. A certified copy of an Ordinance or
Resolution finding that special circumstances exist, as well as a certified copy of a County
Ordinance or Resolution validating such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for
purposes of Class 6b need not be filed at the time of filing the Class 6b eligibility application with
the Assessor, but must be filed with the Assessor no later than the date an assessment appeal is
filed to request the class change to Class 6b. If the Resolution is not filed at the time of the Class
6b eligibility application, the applicant shall instead file, at that time, a letter from the
municipality or the County as the case may be, confirming that a Resolution or Ordinance
regarding special circumstances has been requested.
Temporary Emergency Economic Recovery Modification (TEERM) Program: In the instance
where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as defined herein, the
municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may still determine that special
circumstances justify finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purpose of a Class 6b
under the TEERM Program if there has been no purchase for value and the buildings and other
structures have been vacant and unused for at least 12 continuous months. The finding of
abandonment, along with the specification of the special circumstances, shall be included in the
Resolution or Ordinance supporting and consenting to the Class 6b application under the TEERM
Program. If the Ordinance or Resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the County
Board is required to validate such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes
of Class 6b, and a County Resolution to that effect shall be obtained. The applicant must obtain
the municipal enabling Ordinance with the required finding of special circumstances and present
such municipal Ordinance to the Board of Commissioners of Cook County prior to its
determination as to whether it will validate such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned"
for purposes of Class 6b and provide a County Resolution to that effect. A certified copy of an
Ordinance or Resolution finding that special circumstances exist, as well as a certified copy of a
County Ordinance or Resolution validating such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned"
for purposes of Class 6b need not be filed at the time of filing the Class 6b application with the
Assessor, but must be filed with the Assessor no later than the date an assessment appeal is filed to
request the class change to Class 6b. If the Resolution is not filed at the time of the Class 6b
application, the applicant shall instead file, at that time, a letter from the municipality or the County

Sustainable Emergency Relief (SER) Program: In the instance where real estate does not meet the
definition of abandoned property as defined herein, the municipality or the County Board, as the
case may be, may still determine that special circumstances justify finding that the property is
deemed "qualified" for purpose of Class 6b under the SER Program if:
1.

The industrial enterprise that occupies the premises has been at the same location for a
minimum of ten (10) years prior to the date of application for the SER Program;

2.

The industrial enterprise that occupies the premises submits evidence of hardship supporting a
determination that participation in the SER Program is necessary for the industrial enterprise
to continue operations at its current location and maintain its staff, and that without such
designation the industrial enterprise would not be economically viable causing the property to
be in imminent risk of becoming vacant and unused; and

3.

The applicant is not receiving another Cook County property tax incentive for the same
property.

The finding that a property is qualified, along with the specification of the special circumstances,
and a determination that the applicant's participation in the SER Program is necessary for the
industrial enterprise to continue operations at its current location and maintain its staff, and that
without such designation the industrial enterprise would not be economically viable causing the
property to be in imminent risk of becoming vacant and unused, shall be included in the Resolution
or Ordinance supporting and consenting to the Class 6b application. If the Ordinance or
Resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the County Board is required to validate such a
finding that the property is deemed "qualified" for purposes of Class 6b, and a County Resolution
to that effect shall be obtained. The applicant must obtain the municipal enabling Ordinance with
the required finding of special circumstances and present such municipal Ordinance to the Board of
Commissioners of Cook County prior to its determination as to whether it will validate such a
finding that the property is deemed "qualified" for purposes of Class 6b and provide a County
Resolution to that effect. A certified copy of an Ordinance or Resolution finding that special
circumstances exist, as well as a certified copy of a County Ordinance or Resolution validating
such a finding that the property is deemed "qualified" for purposes of Class 6b need not be filed at
the time of filing the Class 6b application with the Assessor, but must be filed with the Assessor no
later than the date an assessment appeal is filed to request the class change to Class 6b. If the
Resolution is not filed at the time of the Class 6b application, the applicant shall instead file, at that
time, a letter from the municipality or the County as the case may be, confirming that a Resolution
or Ordinance regarding special circumstances has been requested.
Applications for the TEERM Program or SER Program under a Class 6b application must be
received by the Assessor's Office on or before November 30, 2018 to receive consideration. The
Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of annual reports by recipients of Class 6b incentives
granted pursuant to the SER Program as to the use of the property and the number of persons
employed at the Class 6b site. In such reports, recipients shall be required to certify whether the
industrial enterprise that occupied the premises at the time of the SER application continues its
operations at that location. In addition, recipients of Class 6b incentives granted pursuant to the
SER Program shall be required to report to the Assessor within 30 days if the industrial enterprise
that occupied the premises at the time of the SER application ceases operations at that location. A
copy of such reports will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the County
Board for distribution to members of the County Board from the affected districts. Failure to file
such reports within the time established by the Assessor's rules shall result in loss of the incentive
for the period relating to the non-filing. Additionally, if the industrial enterprise that occupied the

 Board of Commissioners

premises at the time of the SER application ceases operations at that location, then the Class 6b
incentive granted pursuant to the SER program shall terminate.
e.

This classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the date such new construction
(excluding demolition, if any) or such substantial rehabilitation was completed and initially
assessed, or in the case of abandoned property, from the date of substantial re-occupancy, or in the
case of incentives granted pursuant to the TEERM Program, from the date of the notice of
approval. In the case of incentives granted pursuant to the SER Program, this classification shall
continue for a period of 12 years from the date of the notice of approval, or until the industrial
enterprise that occupied the premises at the time of the SER application ceases operations at that
location if that occurs sooner.

f.

Unless a Class 6b granted pursuant to the TEERM Program or the SER Program, this incentive
may be renewed during the last year a property is entitled to a ten percent assessment level
pursuant to section 74-64(7), if the following requirements are met;
1.

The taxpayer notifies the Assessor's Office of intent to request renewal of the incentive from
the municipality or the County Board if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area;

2.

The municipality in which the real estate is located or the County Board, if the real estate is
located in an unincorporated area, adopts a Resolution expressly stating that the municipality
or the County Board, as the case may be, has determined that the industrial use of the property
is necessary and beneficial to the local economy, and supports and consents to renewal of the
Class 6b; and

3.

A copy of that Resolution and a completed renewal application are filed with the Assessor's
Office before the expiration of the ten-percent assessment level period.

g.

Class 6b incentives that are granted pursuant to the TEERM Program or SER Program are not
renewable. For all other Class 6b incentives, the number of renewal periods is not limited as long
as the property continues to apply and meet the requirements for Class 6b.

h.

A copy of the request for renewal of the incentive will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the
Secretary of the County Board for distribution to Members of the County Board from the affected
districts.

i.

If no renewal is obtained, the incentive shall be phased out over the next two years, pursuant to
Section 74-64(7). After expiration of the last incentive period, the real estate shall revert to the
applicable classification under this division.

j.

The Assessor may adopt rules consistent with this subsection necessary to ensure proper review of
all factors relevant to determine eligibility for the benefits provided under Class 6b.

k.

The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports by all Class 6b
recipients as to the use of the property and the number of persons employed at the Class 6b site. A
copy of such reports will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the County
Board for distribution to Members of the County Board from the affected districts. Failure to file
such reports within the time established by the Assessor's rules shall result in loss of the incentive

remediation and has received a "No Further Remediation Letter" from the site remediation program.
a.

To be eligible for a Class C classification an applicant must have received a "No Further
Remediation Letter" confirming achievement of the remediation objectives based on the industrial
or commercial use.

b.

The owner of the property is rendered ineligible for the Class C classification by having previously
owned or operated the site, directly or indirectly, or having been a partner or being associated
through a family or business relationship with anyone who has owned or operated the site, which
ownership or operation caused the contamination which was remediated pursuant to a site
remediation. A present owner who can successfully demonstrate that the owner was not
responsible for the contamination may be eligible for Class C classification.

c.

An applicant must obtain from the municipality in which the real estate is located or the County
Board if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, an ordinance or resolution expressly
stating that the municipality or County Board, as the case may be, has determined that the incentive
provided by Class C is necessary for development to occur on that specific real estate and that the
municipality or County Board, as the case may be, supports and consents to the Class C application
to the Assessor. A certified copy of the Ordinance or Resolution must be filed at the time of
application for the Class C classification. A copy of that Ordinance or Resolution, whichever is
submitted, will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the Board for distribution
to the Members of the County Board from the affected districts.

d.

To qualify for the Class C classification, an application for Class C classification must be made
within one year of the receipt of the "No Further Remediation Letter". Where an application for
Class C classification encompasses less than all of the contiguous property owned by the applicant
upon which remediation has been completed, the one year limitation will be waived for any
subsequent separate application for Class C classification for the remainder or for additional
portions of the property, provided that such subsequent application is made within seven years.

e.

Additionally, to qualify for the Class C classification, the estimated remediation costs, including
site investigation, testing, oversight, remediation and removal costs, monitoring, and engineering
and legal fees associated with the remediation process, must total at least $100,000.00, or
alternatively, must total at least 25 percent of the market value of the real estate as determined by
the Assessor's property record card in the year prior to the remediation, whichever is less.

f.

The initial Class C classification shall continue for a period of 12 years for both industrial and
commercial property. For industrial property, this incentive may be renewed during the last year a
property is entitled to a 16 percent assessment level, if the following requirements are met:
1.

The taxpayer notifies the Assessor's Office of the taxpayer's intent to request renewal of the
incentive from the municipality, or the County Board if the real estate is located in an
unincorporated area;

2.

The municipality in which the real estate is located or the County Board, if the real estate is
located in an unincorporated area, adopts a Resolution expressly stating that the municipality
or County Board, as the case may be, has determined that the industrial use of the property is
necessary and beneficial to the local economy, and supports and consents to renewal of the
Class C; and

A copy of that Resolution and a completed renewal application are filed with the Office of the
Assessor before the expiration of the 16 percent assessment level period.
The number of renewal periods is not limited as long as the property continues to apply and
qualify for Class C. Any property which applies for Class C treatment on or before the
adoption date of the Ordinance from which this Division is derived will be eligible for this
renewal term at the end of their original incentive period subject to the above requirements.
The notice of intent to request renewal which is filed with the Assessor's Office will be
forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the Board for distribution to Members
of the County Board from the effected districts.

g.

If, on November 23, 1999, a property is receiving Class C treatment, but the assessment level is
higher than 16 percent, that taxpayer may apply for renewal as outlined above and receive a 16
percent assessment level for the prescribed period beginning after the filing and approval of the
Resolution and renewal application. However, if, as of that effective date, the taxpayer's
assessment is higher than 16 percent and the taxpayer is granted a renewal of the incentive for
subsequent years, no reduction of the current assessment level based on renewal of the incentive
will be granted. If no renewal is obtained, the incentive shall be phased out over the next two (2)
years, pursuant to Section 74-64. After such ten (10) year period expiration of the last incentive
period, the real estate shall revert to the applicable classification under this Division.

h.

For commercial properties, once the original 12 year incentive period has expired, the commercial
Class C incentive will expire. The incentive classification will not be subject to renewal and the
real estate shall revert to the applicable classification under this Division.

i.The Assessor shall review the application and supporting documentation to determine eligibility for the
Class C classification. The Assessor may adopt rules consistent with the foregoing necessary
to ensure proper review of all factors relevant to determine initial and continued eligibility for
the benefits provided under the Class C classification.
j.

The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports by all Class C
recipients as to the use of the property and the number of persons employed at the Class C site.
Such reports shall be verified. Failure to file such reports within the time established by the
Assessor's rules shall result in loss of the incentive for the period relating to the non-filing.

(9)(10) Class 7a. Real estate used primarily for commercial purposes, comprising a qualified commercial
development project, as determined pursuant to Section 74-65(a), located in an area in need of
commercial development, where total development costs, exclusive of land, do not exceed

which they are situated; or abandoned property, as defined in this Division, including the land upon
which such property is situated; or all buildings and other structures which are substantially rehabilitated
to the extent such rehabilitation has added to their value, including qualified land related to the
rehabilitation. Land qualifies when the rehabilitation adds vertical or horizontal square footage to the
improvements. The amount of land eligible for the incentive shall be in such proportion as the square
footage added by the rehabilitation bears to the total square footage of the improvements on the parcel.
a.

In the instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as defined
herein, the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may still determine that special
circumstances justify that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 7a. The
finding of abandonment, along with the specification of the special circumstances, shall be
included in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and consenting to the Class 7a application.

vacant and unused prior to such purchase; or
B.

There has been no purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have been vacant
and unused for less than 24 continuous months.

Such Resolution or Ordinance must be filed with the eligibility application. If the Ordinance or

such real estate is consistent with an overall plan for the rehabilitation of the area; or

3.

Any one of the following five (5) townships: Bloom, Bremen, Calumet, Rich and Thornton.

In the instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as defined

(13)(14) Class S. Real estate otherwise entitled to Class 3 classification under this Division, consisting of
land and existing buildings and structures, which is has been subject to a Section 8 contract renewal.
The portion of the land and building eligible for the incentive shall be in such proportion as the number
of Section 8 units bears to the total number of units. The proportion shall be applied only to property
used for residential purposes, and not to portions of the property, if any, used for commercial purposes.
a.

Property qualifies for the Class S classification if its Section 8 contract has been renewed pursuant
to one of the following alternatives:
1.

HUD has approved renewal of the Section 8 contract under the mark up to market option, after
finding that:
i.

The property has received a physical inspection score of at least 60, in an inspection by
HUD's Real Estate Assessment Center, confirming that the property is decent, safe,
sanitary and in good repair with no uncorrected exigent health and safety (EHS)
violations;

ii.

The property does not have a low- and moderate-income use restriction that cannot be
eliminated by unilateral action by the owner. If, however, the current rent is lower than
the use restriction, HUD may use the mark up to market option to increase the rents to the
use restriction level, which would be a renewal qualifying for the S classification; and

iii. A rent comparability study conducted by HUD has demonstrated that comparable market
rents are above 100 percent of the HUD Fair Market Rent.
2.

HUD has approved a contract renewal for five (5) years of the Section 8 contract under the
mark up to market under HUD's discretionary authority, after finding that the property meets
at least one of the required criteria:
i.

A vulnerable population is affected;

ii.

There is a low vacancy rate in the area, which would make tenant based assistance
difficult to use, or a lack of comparable housing; or

iii. The project is a high priority for the local community, as demonstrated by a contribution
of state or local funds to the property.
3.

b.

HUD has approved renewal of a Section 8 contract for a not-for-profit corporation under any
available option under HUD's renewal procedures as described in HUD's Section 8 Renewal
Policy Guidelines.

Additional requirements for qualification for the S classification are:
1.

At least 20 percent of the living units must be Section 8 units for qualifying low-and
moderate-income persons.

2.

The owner must agree to retain at least the existing number of Section 8 units for at least five
(5) years after the expiration of the expiring or expired Section 8 contract.

3.

For the duration of the Class S classification period, applicant must file annually with the
Assessor, on or before a date determined by the Assessor, a sworn statement verifying
continuous compliance with the Class S provisions of this Division.

discretionary authority or a Section 8 contract that has been renewed by a not-for-profit corporation
under any available option under HUD's renewal procedures as described in HUD's Section 8
Renewal Policy Guidelines. The classification shall continue until the expiration or termination of
the Section 8 contract.

e.

The incentive may be renewed if the Section 8 contract is again renewed under any of the
following three options: 1) the mark up to market option; 2) the mark up to market option under
HUD's discretionary authority; or 3) by a not-for-profit corporation under any available option
under HUD's renewal procedures as described in HUD's Section 8 Renewal Policy Guidelines.

eligibility application must be made to the Assessor within one (1) year prior to the commencement
of substantial rehabilitation. After the substantial rehabilitation has been completed, the
preservation commission shall review the project to determine that it is eligible under subsection
(14) of this Section. The applicant must supplement the eligibility application with a copy of the
determination of the preservation commission prior to classification of the real estate as Class L.

g.

The initial Class L classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the date such
substantial rehabilitation was completed and initially assessed.

percent assessment level for the prescribed period beginning after the filing and approval of the
Resolution and renewal application. However, if as of the effective date, the taxpayer's
assessment is higher than 16 percent and the taxpayer is granted a renewal of the incentive for
subsequent years, no reduction of the current assessment level based on renewal of the incentive
will be granted. If no renewal is obtained, the incentive shall be phased out over the next two
years, pursuant to Section 74-64. After expiration of the last incentive period, the real estate shall
revert to the applicable classification under this Division.

j.

For commercial properties, once the original 12 year incentive period has expired, the commercial
Class L incentive will expire. The incentive classification will not be subject to renewal and the
real estate shall revert to the applicable classification under this Division.

k.

The Assessor shall adopt rules consistent with the foregoing necessary to ensure proper review of
all factors relevant to determine initial and continued eligibility for the benefits provided under
Class L.

l.

The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports by all Class L
recipients as to the continued landmark status of the property and the number of persons employed
at the Class L site. Failure to file such reports within the time established by the Assessor's rules
may result in loss of the incentive for the period relating to the non-filing.

Sec. 74-64. Market value percentages.
The Assessor shall assess, and the Board of Review shall review, assessments on real estate in the various
classes at the following percentages of market value:
(1) Class 1: 10 percent.
(2) Class 2: 10 percent.
(3) Class 3: 16 percent in tax year 2009, 13 percent in tax year 2010, 10 percent in tax year 2011, and
subsequent years.
(4) Class 4: 25 percent.
(5) Class 5a: 25 percent.
(6) Class 5b: 25 percent.

ten (10) year periods.

year 12.
Sec. 74-65. Qualifications for commercial development project status.
(a) To qualify as a commercial development project under Class 7a or 7b, it is necessary that the project be
located in an area in need of commercial development in that:
(1) The area is, or has been within the last ten (10) years, designated by Federal, State or local agency as a
conservation, blighted or renewal area or an area encompassing a rehabilitation or redevelopment plan
or project adopted under the Illinois Urban Renewal Consolidation Act of 1961, as amended, or the
Commercial Renewal Re-development Areas Act of 1967, as amended, or that the area is located in a
Federal Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community, as proposed and approved by the County Board
on June 22, 1994, or the Chicago City Council on May 18, 1994, or the Commercial District
Development Commission Ordinance of the City of Chicago or designation of like effect adopted under
any similar statute or Ordinance;
(2) Real estate taxes within the area, during the last six (6) years, have declined, remained stagnant or
potential real estate taxes are not being fully realized due to the depressed condition of the area;
(3) There is a reasonable expectation that the development, re-development or rehabilitation of the
commercial development project is viable and likely to go forward on a reasonably timely basis if
granted Class 7a or 7b designation and will therefore result in the economic enhancement of the area;

 Board of Commissioners

Journal - Final

March 12, 2014

(4) Certification of the commercial development project for Class 7a or 7b designation will materially assist
development, redevelopment or rehabilitation of the area and the commercial development project
would not go forward without the full incentive offered under Class 7a or 7b; and
(5) Certification of the commercial development project for Class 7a or 7b designation is reasonably
expected to ultimately result in an increase in real property tax revenue and employment opportunities
within the area.
(b) Prior to filing a Class 7a or 7b eligibility application with the Assessor, an applicant must obtain from the
municipality in which the real estate is located, or the County Board if the real estate is located in an
unincorporated area, an Ordinance or Resolution expressly stating that the municipality or County Board, as
the case may be, has determined that the conditions of Subsections (a)(1)-(a)(5) of this Section are present
and that the municipality or County Board, as the case may be, supports and consents to the Class 7a or 7b
application to the Assessor. A certified copy of such Ordinance or Resolution shall be included with the
Class 7a or 7b application at the time of filing the application with the Assessor. A copy of the Ordinance or
Resolution, whichever is submitted, will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the Board
for distribution to the Members of the County Board from the affected districts. The application shall
include any other information deemed necessary by the Assessor. The applicant must demonstrate that the
commercial development project qualifies for the Class 7a or 7b classification and shall bear the expense of
doing so.
(c) Inasmuch as the County desires to encourage economic development in the neighborhoods of the County,
support the increased use of the incentive by smaller projects and to limit the expense of such applications,
the Assessor shall liberally construe the requirements of Subsections (a)(1)-(a)(5) of this Section for Class 7a
applications.
(d) The Assessor shall adopt rules, including a provision to ensure a proper review of the application and
supporting data.
(e) Certification of a commercial development project shall not be denied by reason of insufficient size if it
otherwise qualifies hereunder. In determining what constitutes the "full incentive offered" as provided in
Subsection (a)(4) of this Section, consideration may be given to any lawful intergovernmental participation
agreements under which the project developer has agreed, as a precondition to Class 7a or 7b certification, to
share a portion of future profits with the appropriate taxing districts.
(f) For Class 7a applications, where the Assessor finds that the conditions of Subsections (a)(1)-(a)(5) of this
Section exist, the Assessor shall, within 60 days after receipt of the application and necessary supporting
data, certify the commercial development project eligible for Class 7a treatment under this Division.
(g) In order to determine Class 7b applications, upon receipt of the application and all the necessary supporting
data, the Assessor shall forward it to the Economic Development Advisory Committee of the County. The
Committee shall within 30 days return the application to the Assessor with a finding stating whether the
conditions of Subsections (a)(1)-(a)(5) of this Section are present. The Assessor shall review the
application, supporting data, findings of the Committee and other appropriate facts. Where the Assessor
finds the conditions of Subsections (a)(1)-(a)(5) of this Section exist, the Assessor shall, within 30 days of
the receipt of the Committee's findings, certify the commercial development project eligible for Class 7b
treatment under this Division.
(h) Class 7a and 7b certifications shall lapse within one year from the date of issuance unless new construction
or substantial rehabilitation, or in the case of abandoned property, reoccupation of the commercial
development project has commenced prior to its expiration.

To be certified as an area in need of substantial revitalization for purposes of Class 8 classification it is
necessary that:
(1) The municipality in which the area is located or, if an unincorporated area, the County determine by
lawful resolution that the area is in a state of economic depression and that it is not economically
feasible for private enterprise to accomplish the necessary modernization, rehabilitation, and
development of the area without public assistance and encouragement, or a determination of similar
import;
(2) The municipality or, if in an unincorporated area, the County apply to the Assessor for certification of
the area as one in need of substantial revitalization;
(3) Upon receiving an application to certify an area as in need of substantial revitalization, the Assessor
shall review the application, supporting data and other appropriate factors relevant to a determination of
the severity of the economic conditions of the area. In determining whether the "in need of substantial
revitalization" requirement is met, the Assessor shall give strong consideration and substantial weight to
the fact that an area is located in a Federal empowerment zone or enterprise community, as proposed
and approved by the County Board on June 22, 1994, or the Chicago City Council on May 18, 1994.

(j)

Upon finding that existing factors convincingly demonstrate that the area is in need of substantial
revitalization, as defined in this Division, the Assessor shall grant such certification to the area. In making
this determination statistical data relevant to the surrounding area as well as the specific area for which
certification is sought may be considered. The surrounding area for the City of Chicago shall be the
community area as defined in this division; for all other areas in the County it shall be, where applicable, the
municipality in which the area is located.

(k) If a municipality within an Enterprise Community, as proposed and approved by the County Board on June
22, 1994, or the Chicago City Council on May 18, 1994, determines by municipal Resolution that the area is
in a state of economic depression and that it is not economically feasible for private enterprise to accomplish
the necessary modernization, rehabilitation, and development of the area without public assistance and
encouragement, or a determination of similar import and submits a request for Class 8 certification, such
certification shall be automatic pursuant to this Division. However, each property eligible for a Class 8
incentive within the certified area must file an application in a timely manner.
(l)

Any Class 6a incentive that is still active can be renewed. The Class 6a incentive is defined in this Division.
The renewal procedures described in Section 74-63 apply to Class 6a as well.

Sec. 74-66. Property in two or more classes.
Where a single parcel of real estate is partially included in two or more of the above described classes, each
portion shall be assessed at the assessment level herein prescribed for that class.
Sec. 74-67. Assessor's status and progress report.
A written report on the status and progress of the implementation of this Division, or any amendments
thereto, and all rules promulgated by the Assessor hereunder, shall be submitted by the County Assessor to the
President and County Board annually on or before December 1.
Sec. 74-68. Classification system to apply with tax assessment year.
(a) The incentive provisions of this Division provided to qualifying parcels of real estate for Class 6a, Class 6b,
Class C, Class 7a, Class 7b and Class 8 shall expire on December 31, 2015, unless otherwise reviewed by

shall be entitled to receive such classification under such terms and conditions.
Sec. 74-69. Applicable assessment level.
The assessment level applicable to real estate classified under incentive Classes 6a, 6b, C, 7a, 7b, 8, 9 and L

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
RESOLUTION REGARDING IMPLEMENTATION OF A FLY QUIET PROGRAM AT O’HARE
INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT AND CREATION OF A FEDERAL FLY QUIET ACT
WHEREAS, the O’Hare Modernization Project includes Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) changes to
landing and take-off patterns, shifting airplane traffic previously arriving from many directions into landing and
take-offs from only two directions, east and west; and
WHEREAS, certain communities on the Northwest Side of the City of Chicago and nearby suburbs reside
underneath the key nighttime air routes, including five glide paths and two major take-off plates, which converge
over the community and are used after 10 p.m.; and
WHEREAS, these communities seek a solution to the nighttime sleep interruptions during the hours of 10 p.m.
and 7 a.m., including the shoulder hours; and
WHEREAS, this concentrated increase in airplane traffic will negatively impact the health and quality of life for
residents and businesses on the Northwest Side of Chicago and the Northwest Suburbs; and
WHEREAS, nearly all of these communities predate O’Hare’s conversion to a commercial airport in the 1950s.

having requested Bid Documents of any changes with respect to such conference or inspection no later than
at least 24 hours prior to the original scheduled date and no less than two business days prior to any newly
scheduled date for such conference or inspection.
(d) Communications with the County regarding competitive bidding process. From the time the Bid Notice is
issued until the successful Bidder has been recommended to the Board by the CPO, all communications to
the County relating to the Bid must be directed in writing (which may be electronic) only to the CPO, or as
otherwise specified in the Bid Documents. Upon receipt of such a request, the CPO will determine if a
response will be provided. Any such response shall be provided in an addendum to all Persons requesting the
Bid Documents. Notwithstanding the foregoing, communications may be made to the Office of Contract
Compliance in writing for the purpose of complying with Division 8, Minority and Women-Owned Business
Enterprise Program.
(e) No changes to Bids. No Bid may be changed, amended or supplemented in any way after the date and time

(f) Bid opening. All Bids shall be opened and a record of such Bids shall be made on the date, and at the time
and location as stated in the Bid Notice or as prescribed in an addendum issued by the CPO. All Bids shall be
opened, and the name of the Bidder and the Bid Price shall be read publicly. If it is determined that an error
was made in the public reading of the Bids, the CPO shall notify all Bidders of such error and reconvene the
Bid opening to correct the record as soon as reasonably possible. If the Bids are submitted electronically, no
public reading shall be required so long as a record of the Bids opened is publicly available immediately after
the Bids are opened.
(g) If only one Bid is received. If only one Bid has been submitted, the CPO will determine whether to open the
Bid or return the Bid to the Bidder via certified mail and reissue the Bid Notice or use a different method to
make the Procurement. If the Bid was submitted electronically, and is not opened, it shall be deleted from the
electronic procurement system.
(h) Evaluation of Bids. The CPO shall review, evaluate and tabulate Responsive Bids. In determining the
apparent low Bid, the CPO shall consider the Responsibility of the Bidder and all applicable preferences and
incentives provided in this Procurement Code. The CPO shall then direct the Bids along with the tabulation
to the Using Agency for review. Upon full review of the Bids and Bid tabulations, the Using Agency shall
notify the CPO in writing of its Procurement recommendation, with justification supporting such
recommendation. The CPO shall review the recommendation of the Using Agency, and shall post on the
County's website the CPO's recommended Bid for award.
(i)

Bid protest. Any Bidder who reasonably believes that the recommended Bidder is not the lowest Responsive
and Responsible Bidder, or has a complaint about the bid process, may submit a bid protest, in writing, and
directed to the CPO. For all Contracts requiring Board approval, any bid protest must be submitted no later
than three business days after the date upon which the CPO posts the recommended Bid for award. For all
Contracts which can be executed by the CPO, any bid protest must be submitted no later than three business
days after the date upon which the CPO posts the recommended Bid for execution. The bid protest must
specify why the protester believes the recommended Bidder is not the lowest Responsive and Responsible
Bidder, or why the protestor believes the bid procedure was unfair, including a statement of how the alleged
unfairness prejudiced the protesting Bidder and the action requested of the CPO. A bid protest based on an
issue which could have been clarified through a request for clarification or information pursuant to Section
34-136(d), Communications with the County regarding competitive bidding process, will not be considered if
the protesting Bidder failed to make such request. When a bid protest has been submitted, no further action

 Board of Commissioners

Journal - Final

March 12, 2014

shall be taken on the Procurement until the CPO makes a decision concerning the bid protest, unless the
Using Agency responds in writing and sufficiently demonstrates that (i) the item to be procured is urgently
required and (ii) failure to make the award promptly will unduly delay delivery or performance or cause
other undue harm.
The CPO shall issue a written decision on the bid protest to the protesting Bidder and to any other Bidder
affected by such decision as soon as reasonably practicable. If the bid protest is upheld based on a lack of
fairness in the bid procedure, the CPO shall re-bid the procurement. If the CPO determines that the
recommended Bidder was not Responsive and Responsible, that Bidder shall be disqualified and the CPO
may either recommend the lowest Responsive and Responsible Bidder or re-bid.
(j)

Board Action. Upon resolution of any bid protests, or expiration of the three-day protest period with no
protests, the CPO shall either execute the Contract if within his/her authority, or submit the Contract to the
Board, through its Finance Committee, for approval and authorization for the CPO to Execute the Contract.
Once the Contract has been approved by the Board, or executed by the CPO, the CPO shall post on the
CPO's website information regarding the Procurement.

(k) Right to reject Bids. The County shall have the right to reject any and all Bids. The CPO is authorized to
exercise this right on behalf of the Board. The CPO shall include a provision in the Bid Documents reserving
the right to reject any and all Bids.
(l)

Procurements Under $150,000.00. The competitive bidding process for procurements greater than $5,000.00
and less than $150,000.00 may consist of a solicitation posted on the CPO's website. The CPO shall
promulgate policies and procedures to implement such Procurements. The CPO is not required to read or
announce such Bids publicly. The CPO shall select the lowest Responsive Bid made by a Responsible
Person, and shall post on the CPO's website information regarding the Procurement.

Sec. 34-137. Small procurements.
Procurements of the same or similar supplies, goods, equipment or services by a Using Agency in an
aggregate amount from the same vendor of less than $5,000.00 in the same fiscal year do not require a
competitive method. The CPO shall promulgate policies and procedures to implement such Procurements.
Sec. 34-138. Requests for qualifications or proposals.
(a) Criteria for use of request for qualifications or proposals. The CPO in consultation with the Using Agency
may determine that it is in the best interest of the County to make a Procurement utilizing the Request for
Qualifications or Request for Proposals process. Examples of Procurements for which an RFQ or RFP
process is appropriate include, but are not limited to: Procurements involving services requiring a high
degree of professional skill where the ability or fitness of the Person plays an important part; Procurements
where the requirements are not clearly known; Procurements where quality rather than quantity is a primary
factor; and Procurements where it is not in the best interest of the County to make price a primary
determinative factor. An RFP process is a competitive process under this Procurement Code, and a Person
selected through an RFP process is not considered a "sole source."
(b) Content of RFQs and RFPs. The CPO shall determine what provisions RFQs and RFPs should contain in
consultation with the requesting Using Agency and will incorporate the necessary details, provisions and
requirements for the RFQ or RFP. RFQs and RFPs shall include a provision stating that the County may
negotiate a Procurement with one or more Respondents or Proposers.

(d) Opening of Responses. The Responses or Proposals shall be opened in the presence of one or more witnesses
after the designated date and time for submission. A representative of the Using Agency may be present at
the opening but shall not be required to attend the opening. The names of the Respondents or Proposers shall
be available to the public after the Procurement has been completed.
(e) Evaluation and Selection for Contract Negotiation. The CPO in coordination with the Using Agency shall
develop evaluation criteria which are included in the RFQ or RFP. These criteria may include, but are not
limited to, experience and qualifications of the Respondent or Proposer, the quality, content and
completeness of the Response or Proposal, the demonstrated willingness and ability of the Respondent or
Proposer to satisfy the requirements as described in the RFQ or RFP, and, if applicable, the cost proposal.
The evaluation shall be performed by a committee chaired by the CPO or a designee of the CPO with
representatives of the Using Agency and other persons designated by the CPO. Respondents or Proposers
shall be accorded fair treatment with regard to evaluation of their Responses or Proposals. Any or all
Respondents or Proposers may be requested to make presentations and/or submit clarifications or revisions to
their Responses or Proposals for the purpose of obtaining best and final Responses or Proposals. The Using
Agency shall document the results of the evaluation. The contents of the Responses or Proposals shall not be
disclosed to competing Respondents or Proposers during the evaluation process or any discussions.
(f) Contract negotiation, approval and Execution. The Using Agency may send its recommendation to the CPO,
setting forth the reasons for such recommendation, which shall be based upon the evaluation criteria. Board
approval is not required to negotiate a Contract. Negotiation of a Contract's terms shall take place between
the prospective Contractor(s) and representatives of the Purchasing Department and the Using Agency. After
a Contract is negotiated, the CPO shall either Execute the Contract, if within the CPO's authority, or forward
the Contract to the Board for approval and authorization for the CPO to execute the Contract. Such request
shall include the justification for the Contract and the selection of the Contractor.
(g) RFP or RFQ protest. Any interested party who has a complaint about the RFP or RFQ process may submit a
protest in writing and directed to the CPO. For all Contracts requiring Board approval, any protest must be
submitted no later than three business days after the date upon which the CPO posts the recommended
contract for award. For all Contracts which can be executed by the CPO, any protest must be submitted no
later than three business days after the date upon which the CPO posts the recommended Contract for
execution. The subject of the protest for any RFP or RFQ shall concern fraud, corruption or illegal acts
undermining the objectives and integrity of the procurement process. Any RFP or RFQ protest must be
submitted no later than three business days after the date upon which the CPO posts the recommended
Response or Proposal for award. The protest must contain a detailed statement of the factual and legal
grounds of the protest, including all relevant documents and exhibits that demonstrate fraud, corruption or
illegal acts having the effect of undermining the integrity of the procurement process and the action
requested of the CPO. A protest based on an issue which could have been clarified through a request for
clarification or information, will not be considered if the protestor failed to make such request. When a
protest has been submitted, no further action shall be taken on the Procurement until the CPO makes a
decision. The CPO shall issue a written decision on the protest to the protestor and to any other Respondent
or Proposer affected by such decision as soon as reasonably practicable. If the protest is upheld, the CPO
shall consult with the Using Agency, and may exercise any of the following remedies: cancel the
procurement; recommend commencing contractual negotiations to the next qualified Respondent or
Proposer, or re-issue the RFP or RFQ.
(h) Board or CPO related action. Upon resolution of any protests, or expiration of the three-day protest period

Contract. Once the Contract has been approved by the Board or executed by the CPO, the CPO shall post on
the CPO's website information regarding the Procurement.
Sec. 34-139. Sole source procurements.
Procurements of supplies, equipment, goods or services may be made without use of one of the competitive
processes if there is either only one source or there is a need for the unique or specialized skill, experience, or
ability possessed by a particular source. The Using Agency must submit a letter to the CPO justifying the sole
source Procurement, and provide any other documents or information required by the CPO.
Sec. 34-140. Comparable government procurement.
If a governmental agency has awarded a contract through a competitive method for the same or similar

vendor at a price or rate at least as favorable as that obtained by that government agency without utilizing a
competitive procurement method set forth in this Procurement Code.

loss or damage, (iii) to prevent or minimize serious disruption in County services, (iv) to ensure the integrity of
County records, or (v) in the reasonable opinion of the CPO, for the best interests of the County. If practicable

Sec. 34-144. Innovative procurement.
(a) The CPO may make a Procurement using innovative methods of procurement, including, but not limited to,
electronic procurement, reverse auctions, electronic bidding, electronic auctions, prequalification and pilot
procurement programs that have no cost to the County. In order to implement innovative methods of
procurement, either directly or through a service provider, the CPO must make a determination that such
process is competitive and in the best interest of the County.
(b) As an alternative or in addition to directly conducting procurement using innovative methods, the CPO may
make a Procurement of electronic procurement services for conducting reverse auctions, electronic auctions,
or provide an on-line or electronic forum for competitive Bids, Requests for Qualifications and Requests for
Proposals and other types of innovative methods of procurement on the County's behalf. The Contract for
such Procurement may contain such terms as the CPO deems necessary, including, but not limited to, terms

(b) The Person must be either an individual who is Socially and Economically Disadvantaged or 51 percent
Owned by one or more individuals who are Socially and Economically Disadvantaged.
(1) The Ownership by a Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Person must be real, substantial, and
continuing, going beyond pro forma ownership of the Person as reflected in Ownership documents.
(2) The contributions to acquire the Ownership interest must be real and substantial, and in accord with
generally accepted industry standards. If eExpertise is part of the contribution, the Expertise must be of
the requisite quality generally recognized in a specialized field, necessary to the Person's potential
success, specific to the type of work the Person performs and documented in the Person's records.
(c) The Person must be managed and cControlled by one or more Socially and Economically Disadvantaged
individual.
(1) There must not be any formal or informal restrictions that limit the customary discretion of the Socially
and Economically Disadvantaged individual(s). There can be no restrictions through corporate charter
provisions, by-law provisions, contracts or any other formal or informal devices that prevent the
Socially and Economically Disadvantaged individual(s), without the cooperation or vote of any
non-Socially and Economically Disadvantaged individuals, from making any business decision of the
Person, including the making of obligations or the dispersing of funds.
(2) The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged individual(s) must possess the power to direct or cause
the direction of the management and policies of the Person and to make day-to-day as well as long-term
decisions on management, policy, operations and work.
(3) The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged individual(s) may delegate various areas of the
management or daily operations of the Person to individuals [who] are not Socially and Economically
Disadvantaged. Such delegations of authority must be revocable, and the Socially and Economically
Disadvantaged individual(s) must retain the power to hire and fire any such Person. The Socially and
Economically Disadvantaged individual(s) must actually exercise control over the Person's operations,
work, management and policy.
(4) The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged individual(s) must have an overall understanding of, and
managerial and technical competence, experience and Expertise, directly related to the Person's

operations and work. The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged individual(s) must have the ability
to intelligently and critically evaluate information presented by other participants in the Person's
activities and to make independent decisions concerning the Person's daily operations, work,
management, and policymaking.
(5) If federal, state or local laws, regulations or statutes require a particular license or other credential to
own or control a certain type of Person, then the Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s)
must possess the license or credential. If state law, County ordinance or other law regulations or statute
does not require that the owner possess the license or credential, then the fact that the owner(s) lacks
such license or credential is a factor, but is not dispositive, in determining whether the Socially and
Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) actually controls the firm.
(6) A Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner cannot engage in outside employment or other
business interests that conflict with the management of the Person or prevent the owner from devoting
sufficient time and attention to manage and Control the Person's day to day activities.
(d) Only an independent Person may be certified as a MBE or WBE. An independent Person is one whose
viability does not depend on its relationship with another Person, and who has the capacity or ability to
successfully undertake and complete the relevant work. Recognition of an applicant as a separate entity for
tax or corporate purposes is not necessarily sufficient to demonstrate that a Person is independent. In
determining whether an applicant is an independent business, the CCD will:
(1) Scrutinize relationships with non-Certified Persons in such areas as personnel, facilities, equipment,
financial and/or bonding support, and other resources.
(2) Consider whether present or recent employer/employee relationships between the Socially and
Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) of the applicant and non-Certified Persons associated with
non-Certified Firms compromise the applicant's independence.
(3) Examine the applicant's relationships with non-Certified Persons to determine whether a pattern of
exclusive or primary dealings with non-Certified Persons compromises the applicant's independence.
(4) Consider the consistency of relationships between the applicant and non-Certified Persons with normal
industry practice.
(e) The Person The CCD shall certify only Persons that meet all the above criteria. An applicant shall be
Ccertified only for specific supplies, equipment, goods or services, or for types of work in which the Socially
and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) has the ability and Expertise to manage and Ccontrol the Person's
operations and work.
(f) The County shall certify the eligibility of Joint Ventures involving MBEs or WBEs and non-Certified Firms,
provided that the Joint Venture meets the criteria for certification as an MBE or WBE. To be considered an
eligible Joint Venture, at least one partner of the Joint Venture must be a Certified Firm, with a share in the
capital contribution, control, management, risks, and profits of the Joint Venture which is equal to its
ownership interest. Each Certified Firm partner must contribute property, capital, efforts, skill and
knowledge and be responsible for a distinct, clearly defined portion of the work of the contract. Joint
Ventures must have an agreement in writing specifying the terms and conditions of the relationships between
the partners and their relationship and responsibility to the contract.

entities, provided that Cook County’s requirements are met In lieu of conducting its own certifications, the
CCD by rule may accept formal certifications by other entities as meeting the requirements of the Program,

if the CCD determines that the certification standards of such entities are comparable to those set forth
herein.
(gh) The certification status of all MBEs and WBEs shall be reviewed periodically by the Office of Contract
Compliance. Failure of the Person to seek recertification by filing the necessary documentation with the
CCD as provided by rule may result in decertification.
(hi) It is the responsibility of the Certified PCE to notify the CCD of any change in its circumstances affecting its
continued eligibility for the Program. Failure to do so may result in the PCE's decertification.
(ij) The CCD shall decertify a PCE that does not continuously meet the eligibility criteria.
(k) Disqualification pursuant to Division 4 of the Procurement Code shall create a prima facie case for
decertification by the County. The challenged PCE shall have the burden of proving that its County
certification should be maintained.
(jl) Decertification by another agency shall create a prima facie case for decertification by the County. The
challenged PCE shall have the burden of proving that its County certification should be maintained.
(km) A Person that has been denied certification or recertification or has been decertified may protest the denial
or decertification as provided by rule. by submitting a petition for review in a proceeding made pursuant to
Part I, Chapter 2, Article IX, Administrative Hearings, and the Administrative Rules promulgated
thereunder.
(ln) A Person found to be ineligible may not apply for certification for six monthsone year after the effective date
of the final decision.
(mo) A third party may challenge the eligibility of an applicant for Certification or a Certified PCE pursuant to
procedures established by the CCD. Such challenges shall be signed and sworn by the individual challenging
the eligibility of an applicant for Certification or a Certified PCE. The burden of proof shall rest with the
complainant. Such challenges to eligibility shall be subject to an appeal. The CCD shall be the final arbiter of
all challenges. The presumption that the challenged PCE is eligible shall remain in effect until the CCD
renders a final decision.
Sec. 34-269. Utilization plan; commercially useful function.
(a) Utilization Plan required. The CPO shall include in Contract Documents for Contracts covered by this
Division, a requirement that a Utilization Plan be submitted which either: (i) commits to PCE participation
equal to or greater than the applicable Program Goals or Contract Specific Goals, or (ii) requests a waiver of
all or a portion of a Program Goal or Contract Specific Goal.
(1) The Utilization Plan shall be in such form and contain such information as is required by the CCD, and
may include such components as direct PCE participation, indirect PCE participation, and a mentoring
relationship with one or more PCEs.
(2) The Utilization Plan shall be due at the time the bid/proposal is due. Failure to include a Utilization Plan
will render the submission not Responsive.
(3) The CCD shall review and either approve or reject the Utilization Plan. For purposes of evaluation a
Utilization Plan, only PCEs which perform a Commercially Useful Function relative to the supplies,
equipment, goods, services, or types of work for which the PCE has been certified shall be considered.

(4) Once a Utilization Plan has been approved, the Contractor cannot make changes to the Utilization Plan,
including substituting PCEs named in the Utilization Plan, without the prior written approval of the
CCD, CPO and the Using Agency. The CCD shall promulgate procedures for changes to the Utilization
Plan.
(b) Commercially Useful Function. To be considered in meeting Goals, a PCE must perform a Commercially
Useful Function, as determined pursuant to this Subsection 34-269(b). "Commercially Useful Function"
means the performance of a distinct element of work required for the Procurement, with the requisite skill
and Expertise.
(1) In the case of a Procurement of goods or equipment, ordering from a manufacturer or distributor for
delivery directly to the Using Agency is not a Commercially Useful Function; provided, however, that
to the extent such practice is consistent with normal industry practices, a PCE subcontractor may enter
into second tier subcontracts. However, if a PCE Contractor or subcontractor subcontracts a
significantly greater portion of the work of the Contract than would be expected on the basis of normal
industry practices, the PCE shall be presumed not to be performing a Commercially Useful Function.
(2) In the case of a Procurement of services, a Person which subcontracts with another Person to perform
the services required does not perform a Commercially Useful Function unless such Person also
performs significant supervisory or management responsibilities. A Broker does not fulfill a
Commercially Useful Function. In the case of a Joint Venture partner, each Joint Venture partner must
perform a Commercially Useful Function.
(c 3) A PCE does not perform a Commercially Useful Function if its role is limited to that of an extra
participant in the Contract through which funds are passed in order to obtain the appearance of PCE
participation.
(d4) When a PCE is presumed not to be performing a Commercially Useful Function, the Certified PCE and
the Person seeking to include that PCE in its Utilization Plan, may present evidence to rebut this
presumption.
(e) Once a Utilization Plan has been approved, the Contractor cannot make changes to the Utilization Plan,
including substituting PCEs named in the Utilization Plan, without the prior written approval of the CCD,
CPO and the Using Agency. The CCD shall promulgate procedures for changes to the Utilization Plan.
Sec. 34-270. Methods to achieve goals and compliance.
A Person may achieve the applicable Contract Specific Goals in any one or more of the methods set forth
below. The same PCE, whether as a contractor, subcontractor or supplier, cannot be utilized as both a MBE and a
WBE on the same Contract.
(1) PCE as prime Contractor. An MBE or WBE may count its own participation toward the achievement of
the applicable MBE or WBE goal. Such PCE will be required to meet the other goals by another method
described herein. If a WBE is also a MBE, such WBE's participation may count toward either the MBE
or WBE Goal but not both.
(2) Joint Venture with one or more PCE. Where a Person engages in a Joint Venture with one or more
PCEs, the Utilization Plan shall include a written agreement at least the information set forth in
Subsection 34-384(ii)1 through 4 [(2)a. through d.] below. The CCD shall consider the following in
determining whether the proposed Utilization Plan satisfies the Program Goals based upon such written
Joint Venture agreement and the Utilization Plan.

Journal - Final

March 12, 2014

Each Joint Venture partner's initial capital investment;
The extent to which the PCE's proposed participation in the performance of the Contract constitutes
a Commercially Useful Function;
Whether the PCE's share in the risks and profits of the Joint Venture is proportional to their
ownership interest;
Whether the PCE will have duties, responsibilities, management Control and risk with respect to
the Joint Venture in proportion to its ownership interest;

(3) Subcontracting. A Person may achieve the Contract Specific Goals by means of subcontracting with, or
purchasing from one or more PCEs.
Sec. 34-271. Request for a total or partial waiver; good faith efforts.
(a) In reviewing a partial or total request for waiver of a Goal, the CCD shall determine whether a Person has
made good faith efforts to meet the applicable Goals and to what extent the waiver request should be granted.
In determining whether a Person has made Good faith efforts, the CCD will consider whether the Person has
taken the following actions:
(1) Review lists of PCEs maintained by the County and other State and local governments and agencies to
identify qualified PCEs for solicitation for Bids;
(2) Divide Procurement requirements into small tasks or quantities. This shall include, where appropriate,
breaking out Contract work items into economically feasible units, consistent with the availability of
PCEs, to facilitate PCE participation, even when the Contractor would otherwise prefer to perform these
work items with its own forces;
(3) Adjust any insurance requirements imposed by the Person seeking PCEs, or otherwise assist PCEs in
obtaining any required insurance, where economically feasible, to encourage participation by PCEs;
(4) Make timely attempts to contact PCEs providing the type of supplies, equipment, goods or services
required for the Procurement; and provide them with a convenient and timely opportunity to obtain and
review all information concerning the Procurement necessary to enable such PCE to respond;
(5) Follow up initial contacts of PCEs to determine if they are interested participating in the Procurement;
(6) Negotiate in good faith and on a timely basis with PCEs to enable them to participate in the
Procurement. Evidence of such negotiation includes the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of
PCEs that were contacted; a description of the information provided regarding the plans and
specifications for the work selected for subcontracting; and why agreements could not be reached. The
Contractor may not reject PCEs as being unqualified without sound reasons. That there may be some
additional costs involved in finding and using PCEs is not in itself sufficient reason for a Contractor's
failure to meet the Goals, as long as such costs are reasonable;
(7) Make efforts to assist interested PCEs in obtaining necessary equipment, supplies, materials, or related
assistance or services, where appropriate; provided, however, that such efforts shall not be inconsistent
with the requirement that the PCE be responsible for actually obtaining and paying for such items;
(8) Establish delivery schedules which will encourage participation by PCEs, where the requirements of the
Procurement permit;
(9) Use the services and assistance of the CCD's staff, the Small Business Administration, the Office of
Minority Business Enterprises of the U.S. Department of Commerce;

 Board of Commissioners

Journal - Final

March 12, 2014

(10) Timely notify appropriate community and minority and women's business organizations identified as
assist agencies of the opportunity for participation in the Procurement;
(11) Demonstrate to the CCD that no PCE exists with which a mentor/protege relationship could be
established, as described in Section 34-271
(b) In determining whether a Bidder or Respondent has made Good Faith Efforts, the levels of participation by
PCEs set forth in Utilization Plans submitted by other Persons for the same Procurement may be considered.
For example, if the apparent successful Bidder or Respondent fails to meet the Contract Specific Goals, but
meets or exceeds the average PCE participation obtained by other Bidders or Respondents, this may be
evidence that the apparent successful Bidder or Respondent made Good Faith Efforts.
(c) Where the County requires professional services, the County must be able to call upon those professionals
whose particular training and experience are most beneficial to the County.
(1) The County sets an annual "best efforts" goal of 35 percent PCE participation for the total professional
services and consulting services utilized by the County.
(2) A Utilization Plan shall be required, and if a waiver or partial waiver is requested, "good faith" efforts
shall be demonstrated as set forth in Section 34-271; provided, however, that such Persons shall not be
required to attempt to subcontract with PCEs if subcontractors would not typically be utilized for the
type of Procurement. In such cases, the Person shall document the reasons for not subcontracting in a
waiver request.
(32) The Contractor will endeavor to maximize use of PCEs for supplies, equipment, goods or services for
such Contractor's business operations not specifically for the Procurement.
(43) If such Person is required to have or has an affirmative action plan and goals, such plan and goals shall
be submitted with their Utilization Plan. The CCD shall compare such plan and goals with the Person's
actual affirmative action achievements and such achievements may be considered by the County in
future Procurements.
(d) Mentor/protege agreements. Where a Contractor enters into mentor/protege agreement with a PCE to
improve or develop certain aspects of the business of the PCE, the CCD shall evaluate the effect of such
agreement as a factor in determining good faith efforts. The mentor/protege agreement may provide for the
Contractor to assist the PCE in such areas as technical aspects of the PCE's business, improving financial
management, or providing on-the-job training. To constitute good faith efforts, the mentor/protege agreement
shall satisfy the following requirements.
(1) The PCE performs a Commercially Useful Function;
(2) The agreement shall be included in the Utilization Plan; and
(3) The agreement clearly defines the respective responsibilities of the Contractor and the PCE and includes
specific, measurable goals to be attained by both parties through the performance of the agreement. In
order to be a factor in establishing best efforts, the mentor/protege agreement must be for a reasonable
period of time.
(e) The CCD may grant a total or partial waiver based upon the following criteria:
(1) There are not sufficient PCEs capable of providing the supplies, equipment, goods or services required
for the Procurement;

 Board of Commissioners

Journal - Final

March 12, 2014

(2) The Procurement cannot reasonably be divided;
(3) The price required by potential PCEs is more than ten percent above competitive levels; and
(4) Any other factor relating to good faith efforts as set forth in the Person's Utilization Plan.
Sec. 34-272. Calculating PCE participation.
In calculating a PCE's participation, only dollar amounts commensurate with a PCE's performance of a
Commercially Useful Function may be counted.
(a) The dollar value of that portion of a Procurement that is performed by the PCEs' own forces shall be
counted, including the cost of supplies, materials and equipment furnished by the PCE for the
Procurement, whether purchased or leased (except to the extent purchased or leased from the Contractor
or the Contractor's Affiliate).
(b) The dollar amount of fees or commissions charged by a PCE for providing a bona fide service, such as
professional, technical, consultant, managerial, insurance brokerage or surety services, shall be counted,
provided the fee is reasonable and not excessive as compared with fees customarily charged for similar
services.
(c) When a PCE is a Joint Venture partner, only the dollar value of the distinct, clearly defined work
performed by the PCE with its own forces, shall be counted.
(d) Only the dollar value must be commensurate with the work the PCE actually performs.
(e) One hundred percent of the cost of the supplies, equipment or goods obtained from a PCE
Manufacturer, or Distributor, or Regular Dealer shall be counted.
(f) One hundred percent of the fees or transportation charges for the delivery of supplies, equipment,
materials or goods shall be counted only if the payment of such fees is a customary industry practice and
such fees are commensurate with fees customarily charged for similar services.
(g) If a PCE ceases to be Certified during its performance on a Procurement, the dollar value of work
performed under a Contract with that Person after it has ceased to be Certified shall not be counted.
(h) Only the dollar amount actually paid to the PCE shall be counted toward the participation of a PCE.
Sec. 34-273. Review of contract performance.
(a) Compliance with Utilization Plan. The CCD shall review the Contractor's compliance with its Utilization
Plan as necessary during the performance of the Contract. The CCD may establish such requirements for
periodic Contractor reporting on compliance with its Utilization Plan as the CCD determines appropriate and
necessary. A Contractor shall be required to provide any additional requested compliance documentation
within 14 days of request by the CCD.
(1) If the CCD determines that the Contractor has failed to comply with its Utilization Plan, the CCD shall
notify the CPO of such failure. The CPO shall then send notice of default to the Contractor, and the
Contractor shall have such time to cure the default as is provided in the Contract. If no such period is
provided, the Contractor shall have ten days to cure such default. For purposes of this section, providing
a plan for bringing the Contract into compliance with the Utilization Plan may constitute a cure, if

 Board of Commissioners

Journal - Final

March 12, 2014

compliance cannot reasonably be achieved within the applicable cure period, and if compliance is
achieved in accordance with such plan.
(2) If a Contractor fails to provide any documentation required by the CCD, the CCD shall notify the CPO
of such failure. The CPO shall then send notice of default to the Contractor, and the Contractor shall
have such time to cure the default as is provided in the Contract. If no such period is provided, the
Contractor shall have ten days to cure such default.
(b) Bid and target market programs. To address more specifically the barriers to PCE participation as prime
Contractors in County work, the CCD may recommend to the CPO to institute the following special PCE
bidding provisions, following determination of the appropriateness of such provisions.
(1) In connection with the award of a Contract subject to competitive bidding on which a PCE has bid and
where the PCE is bidding on the item in question for the first time; and has never successfully bid on a
Cook County purchasing contract, the Contract Compliance Director may, at the opening of the bids on
the item, compare the PCE Bid with the lowest Bid, and, if the PCE's Bid is closely competitive as
defined by guidelines to be established by the Contract Compliance Director with that of lowest actual
Bids, direct the CPO to declare the PCE the successful Bidder. A PCE may use this procedure only once
to become the successful Bidder on any particular item. Thereafter, the PCE must be totally competitive
in terms of price to be the successful Bidder.
(2) The Contract Compliance Director shall develop and coordinate a target market program as follows:
a.

The Contract Compliance Director shall review the availability of PCEs providing various goods
and services and shall identify for inclusion in a potential program for bidding, Requests for
Qualifications, and Requests for Proposals among PCE Persons certain commodity, goods or
services areas with sufficient PCE availability to ensure that the County receives a competitive
price. The Contract Compliance Director shall report his/her findings and recommendations to the
Contract Compliance Committee;

b.

Upon a determination by the CCD that such a program is advisable for any particular commodity,
goods or services procurement, the Contract Compliance Director will institute the following
procedures:
1.

The Contract Compliance Director will notify the CPO of identification of those commodity,
goods, services, or North American Industry Classification Standard (NAICS) codes
appropriate for a target market program;

2.

To the extent practicable, the CPO, with the aid of the Contract Compliance Director, shall
divide procurement in the designated commodity, goods or services areas into economically
feasible sizes to facilitate Bids, Requests for Qualifications, or Requests for Proposals or
offers from PCEs and shall designate contracts to be offered under the target market program;

3.

The CPO shall offer PCEs the opportunity to bid on such contracts, or submit responses or
proposals, in a limited competition;

4.

All standard County procurement rules for bidding, Requests for Qualifications, or Requests
for Proposals, will then become effective and, provided that at least three PCEs Bid or submit
responses or proposals make an offer on the contract, the lowest Responsive and Responsible
Bidder, Proposer, or Respondent among the PCEs will receive the contract;

 Board of Commissioners

In the event less than three PCEs Bid or submit responses or proposals pursuant to a Request
for Qualifications or Request for Proposalsmake an offer on the Contract, or in the event that
if there is no Responsive Bid or best and final Response or Proposal offer received from a
Responsible PCE, the CPO shall rebid the Contract or reissue the Request for Qualifications
or Request for Proposals not subject to the target market program.

Participation in the target market program shall be limited to Minority Business Enterprises,
Women's Business Enterprises and Joint Ventures consisting exclusively of Minority Business
Enterprises, Women's Business Enterprises or both. The PCE Contractor on a target market
Contract may subcontract up to 49 percent of the dollar value of the target market Contract to
subcontractors who are not Minority Business Enterprises or Women's Business Enterprises.

Sec. 34-274. Prompt payment of PCEs.
If an invoice from a Contractor includes payment for supplies, equipment, goods or services furnished by a
PCE, Contractor shall pay such PCE for such supplies, equipment, goods or services within 3015 days after
receipt of payment from the County. The CCD shall investigate any complaint or charge of excessive delay in
payment, and shall report the results of such investigations to the Contract Compliance Committee and to the
County Comptroller. Failure of Contractor to comply with this section 34-388 shall constitute a material breach of
the Contract.
Sec. 34-275. Reporting and review.
The CCD shall report to the Board on an annual basis with respect to the following:
(1) The percentage of the total dollar amount of Procurements for such year actually received by PCEs;
(2) The number of MBEs and WBEs available for participation in Procurements, by category;
(3) An evaluation of the effectiveness of this division in ensuring equitable participation by PCEs in
Procurements;
(4) An assessment of the continuing need for the Program;
(5) Identification of any enforcement problems; and
(6) Any recommendations with respect to modifying or improving the Program, including discontinuing or
modifying Program Goals in those cases where Minority Business Enterprises and Women's Business
Enterprises no longer are disadvantaged by the effects of discrimination in their participation in
Procurements.

WBE.

and continuing, going beyond pro forma ownership of the firm as reflected in ownership documents.
The owner(s) must enjoy the customary incidents of ownership and share in the risks and profits
commensurate with that ownership interest.
(2) The contributions of capital or Expertise by the Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) to
acquire the ownership interest must be real and substantial and in accord with generally accepted
industry standards. If Expertise is relied upon as part of a Socially and Economically Disadvantaged
owner's contribution to acquire ownership, the Expertise must be of the requisite quality generally
recognized in a specialized field, in areas critical to the firm's operations, indispensable to the firm's
potential success, specific to the type of work the firm performs and documented in the firm's records.
The individual whose Expertise is relied upon must have a commensurate financial investment in the
firm.
(c) Only a firm that is managed and controlled by a Socially and Economically Disadvantaged person(s) may be
certified as an MBE or WBE.
(1) A firm must not be subject to any formal or informal restrictions that limit the customary discretion of
the Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s). There can be no restrictions through corporate
charter provisions, by-law provisions, contracts or any other formal or informal devices that prevent the
Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s), without the cooperation or vote of any
non-Socially and Economically Disadvantaged person, from making any business decision of the firm,
including the making of obligations or the disbursing of funds.
(2) The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) must possess the power to direct or cause the
direction of the management and policies of the firm and to make day-to-day as well as long-term
decisions on management, policy, operations and work.

and work. The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) must have the ability to intelligently
and critically evaluate information presented by other participants in the firm's activities and to make
independent decisions concerning the firm's daily operations, work, management, and policymaking.
(5) If federal, state and/or local laws, regulations or statutes require the owner(s) to have a particular license
or other credential to own and/or control a certain type of firm, then the Socially and Economically
Disadvantaged owner(s) must possess the required license or credential. If state law, County ordinance
or other law regulations or statute does not require that the owner possess the license or credential, that
the owner(s) lacks such license or credential is a factor, but is not dispositive, in determining whether
the Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) actually controls the firm.
(6) A Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner cannot engage in outside employment or other
business interests that conflict with the management of the firm or prevent the owner from devoting
sufficient time and attention to the affairs of the firm to manage and control its day-to-day activities.

viability does not depend on its relationship with another firmPerson, and who has the capacity or ability to
successfully undertake and complete the relevant work. Recognition of an applicant as a separate entity for
tax or corporate purposes is not necessarily sufficient to demonstrate that a firm is independent and
non-Affiliated. In determining whether an applicant is an independent Business, the CC Director will:
(1) Scrutinize relationships with non-Certified Firms in such areas as personnel, facilities, equipment,
financial and/or bonding support, and other resources.
(2) Consider whether present or recent employer/employee relationships between the Socially and
Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) of the applicant and non-Certified Firms or persons associated
with non-Certified Firms compromise the applicant's independence.
(3) Examine the applicant's relationships with non-Certified Firms to determine whether a pattern of
exclusive or primary dealings with non-Certified Firm compromises the applicant's independence.
(4) Consider the consistency of relationships between the applicant and non-Certified Firms with normal
industry practice.
(e) The CCD shall certify only Persons that meet all the above criteria. An applicant shall be certified only for
specific types of work in which the Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) has the ability and
Expertise to manage and control the firmperson's operations and work.
(f) The County shall certify the eligibility of Joint Ventures involving MBEs or WBEs and non-Certified Firms,
provided that the Joint Venture meets the criteria for certification as an MBE or WBE. To be considered an
eligible Joint Venture, at least one partner of the Joint Venture must be a Certified Firm, with a share in the
capital contribution, control, management, risks, and profits of the Joint Venture which is equal to its
ownership interest. Each Certified Firm partner must contribute property, capital, efforts, skill and
knowledge and be responsible for a distinct, clearly defined portion of the work of the contract. Joint
Ventures must have an agreement in writing specifying the terms and conditions of the relationships between
the partners and their relationship and responsibility to the contract.

(kl)

presumption that the challenged firm is eligible shall remain in effect until the CC Director renders a final
decision.

Sec. 34-296. Counting MBE and WBE participation.
(a) The entire amount of that portion of a contract that is performed by the MBE's or WBE's own forces shall be
counted, including the cost of supplies and materials obtained by the MBE or WBE for the work on the
contract, and supplies purchased or equipment leased by the MBE or WBE (except supplies and equipment
the MBE or WBE purchases or leases from the prime Contractor or the prime Contractor's Affiliate).
(b) The entire amount of fees or commissions charged by an MBE or WBE for providing a bona fide service,
such as professional, technical, consultant or managerial services, or for providing bonds or insurance

 Board of Commissioners

Journal - Final

March 12, 2014

specifically required for the performance of a contract, shall be counted, provided the fee is reasonable and
not excessive as compared with fees customarily charged for similar services.
(c) When an MBE or WBE performs as a participant in a Joint Venture, only the portion of the total dollar value
of the contract equal to the distinct, clearly defined portion of the work of the Joint Venture's contract that is
performed by the MBE or WBE with its own forces and for which it is separately at risk, shall be counted.
(d) Only expenditures to an MBE or WBE that is performing a Commercially Useful Function shall be counted.
To determine whether an MBE or WBE is performing a Commercially Useful Function, the County will
evaluate the amount of work subcontracted, industry practices, whether the amount the MBE or WBE is to be
paid under the contract is commensurate with the work it is actually performing and other relevant factors.
To perform a Commercially Useful Function, the MBE or WBE must be responsible, with respect to
materials and supplies used on the contract, for negotiating price, determining quality and quantity, ordering
the material, installing (where applicable) and paying for the material itself. An MBE or WBE does not
perform a Commercially Useful Function if its role is limited to that of an extra participant in the contract
through which funds are passed in order to obtain the appearance of MBE or WBE participation. If an MBE
or WBE subcontracts a greater portion of the work of a contract than would be expected based on normal
industry practice, it is presumed not to perform a Commercially Useful Function. When an MBE or WBE is
presumed not to be performing a Commercially Useful Function, the Certified Firm may present evidence to
rebut this presumption.
(e) One hundred percent of the cost of the materials or supplies obtained from an MBE or WBE Manufacturer or
Regular Dealer shall be counted. One hundred percent of the fees or transportation charges for the delivery of
materials or supplies required on a job site shall be counted only if the payment of such fees is a customary
industry practice and are commensurate with fees customarily charged for similar services.
(f) One hundred percent of the cost of the supplies, equipment or goods obtained from a PCE Manufacturer shall
be counted.
(fg) Sixty percent of the cost of the supplies, equipment or goods obtained from a PCE Distributor or Regular
Dealer shall be counted.
(fh)If a firm ceases to be a Certified Firm for any other reason than graduation from the M/WBE Construction
Program during its performance on a contract, the dollar value of work performed under a contract with that
firm after it has ceased to be certified shall not be counted.
(gi) In determining achievement of Project Specific Goals, the participation of an MBE or WBE shall not be
counted until that amount has been paid to the MBE or WBE.
Sec. 34-297. Contract pre-award compliance procedures.
(a) For all solicitations, the bidder/proposer shall submit a Utilization Plan detailing all subcontractors from
which the Contractor solicited bids or quotations, and if Project Specific Goals have been established, its
achievement of the Goals or its Good Faith Efforts to do so. The Utilization Plan shall be due at the time the
bid/proposal is due.
(b) Any agreement between a Contractor and an MBE or WBE in which the Contractor requires that the MBE or
WBE not provide subcontracting quotations to other Contractors is prohibited.
(c) Where the Contractor cannot achieve the Project Specific Goal(s), the CC Director will determine whether
the Contractor has made Good Faith Efforts to meet the Goal(s). In making this determination, the Director
will consider, at a minimum, the Contractor's efforts to:

 Board of Commissioners

Journal - Final

March 12, 2014

(1) Solicit through all reasonable and available means (e.g., attendance at pre-bid meetings, advertising and
written notices) the interest of all MBEs and WBEs certified in the scopes of work of the contract. The
Contractor shall provide interested MBEs and WBEs with timely, adequate information about the plans,
specifications, and requirements of the contract to allow MBEs and WBEs to respond to the solicitation.
The Contractor must follow up initial solicitations with interested MBEs and WBEs.
(2) Select portions of the work to be performed by MBEs and WBEs in order to increase the likelihood that
the Project Specific Goals will be achieved. This includes, where appropriate, breaking out contract
work items into economically feasible units to facilitate MBE and WBE participation, even when the
Contractor would otherwise prefer to perform these work items with its own forces. It is the Contractor's
responsibility to make a portion of the work available to MBEs and WBEs and to select those portions
of the work or material needs consistent with the availability [of] MBEs and WBEs to facilitate their
participation.
(3) Negotiate in good faith with interested MBEs and WBEs. Evidence of such negotiation includes the
names, addresses, and telephone numbers of MBEs and WBEs that were contacted; a description of the
information provided regarding the plans and specifications for the work selected for subcontracting;
and why agreements could not be reached with MBEs and WBEs. The Contractor may not reject MBEs
and WBEs as being unqualified without sound reasons based on a thorough investigation of their
capabilities. That there may be some additional costs involved in finding and using MBEs and WBEs is
not in itself sufficient reason for a Contractor's failure to meet the Project Specific Goals, as long as
such costs are reasonable. The ability or desire of a Contractor to perform the work of a contract with its
own organization does not relieve it of the responsibility to make Good Faith Efforts on all scopes of
work that could be subcontracted.
(4) Make efforts to assist interested MBEs and WBEs in obtaining bonding, lines of credit, or insurance as
required by the County or the prime Contractor, where appropriate.
(5) Make efforts to assist interested MBEs and WBEs in obtaining necessary equipment, supplies,
materials, or related assistance or services, where appropriate.
(6) Use the services of the Office of Contract Compliance, available minority/women community
organizations, minority/women contractors' groups, government-sponsored minority/women business
assistance offices and other appropriate organizations to provide assistance in the recruitment and
placement of MBEs and WBEs.
(d) In determining whether a Contractor has made Good Faith Efforts, the performance of other Contractors in
meeting the Project Specific Goals may be considered. For example, when the apparent successful
Contractor fails to meet the Project Specific Goals but others meet it, it may be reasonably questioned
whether, with additional reasonable efforts, the apparent successful Contractor could have met the Project
Specific Goals. Similarly, if the apparent successful Contractor fails to meet the Project Specific Goals, but
meets or exceeds the average MBE or WBE participation obtained by other Contractors, this may be
evidence that the apparent successful Contractor made Good Faith Efforts.
(e) A signed letter of intent from each listed MBE or WBE, describing the work, materials, equipment or
services to be performed or provided by the MBE or WBE and the agreed upon dollar value shall be due at
the time of bid proposal or within three days after such submission.
(f) The CC Director shall timely review the Utilization Plan before award, including the scope of work and the
letters of intent from MBEs and WBEs. The CC Director may request clarification in writing of items listed

 Board of Commissioners

Journal - Final

March 12, 2014

in the Utilization Plan, provided such clarification shall not include the opportunity to augment listed
participation or Good Faith Efforts.
(g) If the CC Director determines that the Utilization Plan demonstrates that the Project Specific Goals have
been achieved or Good Faith Efforts made, with the concurrence of the User Department, the CC Director
and User Department shall recommend award to Purchasing Agent.
(h) If the CC Director finds that a Contractor did not make sufficient Good Faith Efforts, the CC Director shall
communicate this finding to the Purchasing Department and recommend that the bid/proposal be rejected. A
Contractor may protest this determination pursuant to the County's bid protest procedures.
Sec. 34-298. Contract administration procedures.
(a) Upon award of a contract by the County that includes Project Specific Goals, the Project Specific Goals
become covenants of performance by the Contractors and incorporated in the contract.
(b) The Contractor shall provide a listing of all subcontractors to be used in the performance of the contract, and
detailed subcontractor information to the County with each request for payment submitted to the County or
as otherwise directed by the County. The CC Director and the User Department shall monitor subcontractor
participation during the course of the contract. The County shall have full and timely access to the
Contractor's books and records, including, without limitation, payroll records, tax returns and records and
books of account, to determine the Contractor's compliance with its commitment to MBE and WBE
participation and the status of any MBE or WBE performing any portion of the contract. This provision shall
be in addition to, and not a substitute for, any other provision allowing inspection of the Contractor's records
by any officer or official of the County for any purpose.
(c) The Contractor cannot make changes to the Utilization Plan or substitute MBEs or WBEs named in the
Utilization Plan without the prior written approval of the CC Director, Purchasing Agent and the User

(5) If federal, state or local laws, regulations or statutes require a particular license or other credential to
own or control a certain type of Person, then the Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s)
must possess the license or credential. If state law, County ordinance or other law regulations or statute
does not require that the owner possess the license or credential, then the fact that the owner(s) lacks
such license or credential is a factor, but is not dispositive, in determining whether the Socially and
Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) actually controls the firm.
(6) A Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner cannot engage in outside employment or other
business interests that conflict with the management of the Person or prevent the owner from devoting
sufficient time and attention to manage and Control the Person's day to day activities.
(d) Only an independent Person may be certified as a MBE or WBE. An independent Person is one whose
viability does not depend on its relationship with another Person, and who has the capacity or ability to
successfully undertake and complete the relevant work. Recognition of an applicant as a separate entity for
tax or corporate purposes is not necessarily sufficient to demonstrate that a Person is independent. In
determining whether an applicant is an independent business, the CCD will:
(1) Scrutinize relationships with non-Certified Persons in such areas as personnel, facilities, equipment,
financial and/or bonding support, and other resources.
(2) Consider whether present or recent employer/employee relationships between the Socially and
Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) of the applicant and non-Certified Persons associated with
non-Certified Firms compromise the applicant's independence.
(3) Examine the applicant's relationships with non-Certified Persons to determine whether a pattern of
exclusive or primary dealings with non-Certified Persons compromises the applicant's independence.
(4) Consider the consistency of relationships between the applicant and non-Certified Persons with normal
industry practice.

Sec. 34-269. Utilization plan; commercially useful function.
(a) Utilization Plan required. The CPO shall include in Contract Documents for Contracts covered by this
Division, a requirement that a Utilization Plan be submitted which either: (i) commits to PCE participation
equal to or greater than the applicable Program Goals or Contract Specific Goals, or (ii) requests a waiver of
all or a portion of a Program Goal or Contract Specific Goal.
(1) The Utilization Plan shall be in such form and contain such information as is required by the CCD, and
may include such components as direct PCE participation, indirect PCE participation, and a mentoring
relationship with one or more PCEs.
(2) The Utilization Plan shall be due at the time the bid/proposal is due. Failure to include a Utilization Plan
will render the submission not Responsive.
(3) The CCD shall review and either approve or reject the Utilization Plan. For purposes of evaluation a
Utilization Plan, only PCEs which perform a Commercially Useful Function relative to the supplies,
equipment, goods, services, or types of work for which the PCE has been certified shall be considered.
(4) Once a Utilization Plan has been approved, the Contractor cannot make changes to the Utilization Plan,
including substituting PCEs named in the Utilization Plan, without the prior written approval of the
CCD, CPO and the Using Agency. The CCD shall promulgate procedures for changes to the Utilization
Plan.
(b) Commercially Useful Function. To be considered in meeting Goals, a PCE must perform a Commercially
Useful Function, as determined pursuant to this Subsection 34-269(b). "Commercially Useful Function"
means the performance of a distinct element of work required for the Procurement, with the requisite skill
and Expertise.
(1) In the case of a Procurement of supplies, equipment, or goods or equipment, placing an ordering from a
manufacturer or distributor for delivery directly to the Using Agency is not a Commercially Useful
Function; provided, however, that to the extent such practice is consistent with normal industry
practices, a PCE subcontractor may enter into second tier subcontracts. However, if a PCE Contractor or
subcontractor subcontracts a significantly greater portion of the work of the Contract than would be
expected on the basis of normal industry practices, the PCE shall be presumed not to be performing a
Commercially Useful Function.
(2) In the case of a Procurement of services, a Person which subcontracts with another Person to perform
the services required does not perform a Commercially Useful Function unless such Person also
performs significant supervisory or management responsibilities. A Broker does not fulfill a
Commercially Useful Function. In the case of a Joint Venture partner, each Joint Venture partner must
perform a Commercially Useful Function.
(c3)A PCE does not perform a Commercially Useful Function if its role is limited to that of an extra
participant in the Contract through which funds are passed in order to obtain the appearance of PCE
participation.
(d4)When a PCE is presumed not to be performing a Commercially Useful Function, the Certified PCE and
the Person seeking to include that PCE in its Utilization Plan, may present evidence to rebut this
presumption.

(e) Once a Utilization Plan has been approved, the Contractor cannot make changes to the Utilization Plan,
including substituting PCEs named in the Utilization Plan, without the prior written approval of the CCD,
CPO and the Using Agency. The CCD shall promulgate procedures for changes to the Utilization Plan.
Sec. 34-270. Methods to achieve goals and compliance.
A Person may achieve the applicable Contract Specific Goals in any one or more of the methods set forth
below. The same PCE, whether as a contractor, subcontractor or supplier, cannot be utilized as both a MBE and a
WBE on the same Contract.
(1) PCE as prime Contractor. An MBE or WBE may count its own participation toward the achievement of
the applicable MBE or WBE goal. Such PCE will be required to meet the other goals by another method
described herein. If a WBE is also a MBE, such WBE's participation may count toward either the MBE
or WBE Goal but not both.
(2) Joint Venture with one or more PCE. Where a Person engages in a Joint Venture with one or more
PCEs, the Utilization Plan shall include a written agreement at least the information set forth in
Subsection 34-384(ii)1 through 4 [(2)a. through d.] below. The CCD shall consider the following in
determining whether the proposed Utilization Plan satisfies the Program Goals based upon such written
Joint Venture agreement and the Utilization Plan.
a.
b.
c.
d.

Each Joint Venture partner's initial capital investment;
The extent to which the PCE's proposed participation in the performance of the Contract constitutes
a Commercially Useful Function;
Whether the PCE's share in the risks and profits of the Joint Venture is proportional to their
ownership interest;
Whether the PCE will have duties, responsibilities, management Control and risk with respect to
the Joint Venture in proportion to its ownership interest;

(3) Subcontracting. A Person may achieve the Contract Specific Goals by means of subcontracting with, or
purchasing from one or more PCEs.
Sec. 34-271. Request for a total or partial waiver; good faith efforts.
(a) In reviewing a partial or total request for waiver of a Goal, the CCD shall determine whether a Person has
made good faith efforts to meet the applicable Goals and to what extent the waiver request should be granted.
In determining whether a Person has made Good faith efforts, the CCD will consider whether the Person has
taken the following actions:
(1) Review lists of PCEs maintained by the County and other State and local governments and agencies to
identify qualified PCEs for solicitation for Bids;
(2) Divide Procurement requirements into small tasks or quantities. This shall include, where appropriate,
breaking out Contract work items into economically feasible units, consistent with the availability of
PCEs, to facilitate PCE participation, even when the Contractor would otherwise prefer to perform these
work items with its own forces;
(3) Adjust any insurance requirements imposed by the Person seeking PCEs, or otherwise assist PCEs in
obtaining any required insurance, where economically feasible, to encourage participation by PCEs;

 Board of Commissioners

Journal - Final

March 12, 2014

(4) Make timely attempts to contact PCEs providing the type of supplies, equipment, goods or services
required for the Procurement; and provide them with a convenient and timely opportunity to obtain and
review all information concerning the Procurement necessary to enable such PCE to respond;
(5) Follow up initial contacts of PCEs to determine if they are interested participating in the Procurement;
(6) Negotiate in good faith and on a timely basis with PCEs to enable them to participate in the
Procurement. Evidence of such negotiation includes the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of
PCEs that were contacted; a description of the information provided regarding the plans and
specifications for the work selected for subcontracting; and why agreements could not be reached. The
Contractor may not reject PCEs as being unqualified without sound reasons. That there may be some
additional costs involved in finding and using PCEs is not in itself sufficient reason for a Contractor's
failure to meet the Goals, as long as such costs are reasonable;
(7) Make efforts to assist interested PCEs in obtaining necessary equipment, supplies, materials, or related
assistance or services, where appropriate; provided, however, that such efforts shall not be inconsistent
with the requirement that the PCE be responsible for actually obtaining and paying for such items;
(8) Establish delivery schedules which will encourage participation by PCEs, where the requirements of the
Procurement permit;
(9) Use the services and assistance of the CCD's staff, the Small Business Administration, the Office of
Minority Business Enterprises of the U.S. Department of Commerce;
(10) Timely notify appropriate community and minority and women's business organizations identified as
assist agencies of the opportunity for participation in the Procurement;
(11) Demonstrate to the CCD that no PCE exists with which a mentor/protege relationship could be
established, as described in Section 34-271
(b) In determining whether a Bidder or Respondent has made Good Faith Efforts, the levels of participation by
PCEs set forth in Utilization Plans submitted by other Persons for the same Procurement may be considered.
For example, if the apparent successful Bidder or Respondent fails to meet the Contract Specific Goals, but
meets or exceeds the average PCE participation obtained by other Bidders or Respondents, this may be
evidence that the apparent successful Bidder or Respondent made Good Faith Efforts.
(c) Where the County requires professional services, the County must be able to call upon those professionals
whose particular training and experience are most beneficial to the County.
(1) The County sets an annual "best efforts" goal of 35 percent PCE participation for the total professional
services and consulting services utilized by the County.
(2) A Utilization Plan shall be required, and if a waiver or partial waiver is requested, "good faith" efforts
shall be demonstrated as set forth in Section 34-271; provided, however, that such Persons shall not be
required to attempt to subcontract with PCEs if subcontractors would not typically be utilized for the
type of Procurement. In such cases, the Person shall document the reasons for not subcontracting in a
waiver request.
(32) The Contractor will endeavor to maximize use of PCEs for supplies, equipment, goods or services for
such Contractor's business operations not specifically for the Procurement.

(43) If such Person is required to have or has an affirmative action plan and goals, such plan and goals shall
be submitted with their Utilization Plan. The CCD shall compare such plan and goals with the Person's
actual affirmative action achievements and such achievements may be considered by the County in
future Procurements.
(d) Mentor/protege agreements. Where a Contractor enters into mentor/protege agreement with a PCE to
improve or develop certain aspects of the business of the PCE, the CCD shall evaluate the effect of such
agreement as a factor in determining good faith efforts. The mentor/protege agreement may provide for the
Contractor to assist the PCE in such areas as technical aspects of the PCE's business, improving financial
management, or providing on-the-job training. To constitute good faith efforts, the mentor/protege agreement
shall satisfy the following requirements.
(1) The PCE performs a Commercially Useful Function;
(2) The agreement shall be included in the Utilization Plan; and
(3) The agreement clearly defines the respective responsibilities of the Contractor and the PCE and includes
specific, measurable goals to be attained by both parties through the performance of the agreement. In
order to be a factor in establishing best efforts, the mentor/protege agreement must be for a reasonable
period of time.
(e) The CCD may grant a total or partial waiver based upon the following criteria:
(1) There are not sufficient PCEs capable of providing the supplies, equipment, goods or services required
for the Procurement;
(2) The Procurement cannot reasonably be divided;
(3) The price required by potential PCEs is more than ten percent above competitive levels; and
(4) Any other factor relating to good faith efforts as set forth in the Person's Utilization Plan.
Sec. 34-272. Calculating PCE participation.
In calculating a PCE's participation, only dollar amounts commensurate with a PCE's performance of a
Commercially Useful Function may be counted.
(a) The dollar value of that portion of a Procurement that is performed by the PCEs' own forces shall be
counted, including the cost of supplies, materials and equipment furnished by the PCE for the
Procurement, whether purchased or leased (except to the extent purchased or leased from the Contractor
or the Contractor's Affiliate).
(b) The dollar amount of fees or commissions charged by a PCE for providing a bona fide service, such as
professional, technical, consultant, managerial, insurance brokerage or surety services, shall be counted,
provided the fee is reasonable and not excessive as compared with fees customarily charged for similar
services.
(c) When a PCE is a Joint Venture partner, only the dollar value of the distinct, clearly defined work
performed by the PCE with its own forces, shall be counted.
(d) Only the dollar value must be commensurate with the work the PCE actually performs.

 Board of Commissioners

Journal - Final

March 12, 2014

(e) One hundred percent of the cost of the supplies, equipment or goods obtained from a PCE
Manufacturer, or Distributor, or Regular Dealer shall be counted.
(f) One hundred percent of the fees or transportation charges for the delivery of supplies, equipment,
materials or goods shall be counted only if the payment of such fees is a customary industry practice and
such fees are commensurate with fees customarily charged for similar services.
(g) If a PCE ceases to be Certified during its performance on a Procurement, the dollar value of work
performed under a Contract with that Person after it has ceased to be Certified shall not be counted.
(h) Only the dollar amount actually paid to the PCE shall be counted toward the participation of a PCE.
Sec. 34-273. Review of contract performance.
(a) Compliance with Utilization Plan. The CCD shall review the Contractor's compliance with its Utilization
Plan as necessary during the performance of the Contract. The CCD may establish such requirements for
periodic Contractor reporting on compliance with its Utilization Plan as the CCD determines appropriate and
necessary. A Contractor shall be required to provide any additional requested compliance documentation
within 14 days of request by the CCD.
(1) If the CCD determines that the Contractor has failed to comply with its Utilization Plan, the CCD shall
notify the CPO of such failure. The CPO shall then send notice of default to the Contractor, and the
Contractor shall have such time to cure the default as is provided in the Contract. If no such period is
provided, the Contractor shall have ten days to cure such default. For purposes of this section, providing
a plan for bringing the Contract into compliance with the Utilization Plan may constitute a cure, if
compliance cannot reasonably be achieved within the applicable cure period, and if compliance is
achieved in accordance with such plan.
(2) If a Contractor fails to provide any documentation required by the CCD, the CCD shall notify the CPO
of such failure. The CPO shall then send notice of default to the Contractor, and the Contractor shall
have such time to cure the default as is provided in the Contract. If no such period is provided, the
Contractor shall have ten days to cure such default.
(b) Bid and target market programs. To address more specifically the barriers to PCE participation as prime
Contractors in County work, the CCD may recommend to the CPO to institute the following special PCE
bidding provisions, following determination of the appropriateness of such provisions.
(1) In connection with the award of a Contract subject to competitive bidding on which a PCE has bid and
where the PCE is bidding on the item in question for the first time; and has never successfully bid on a
Cook County purchasing contract, the Contract Compliance Director may, at the opening of the bids on
the item, compare the PCE Bid with the lowest Bid, and, if the PCE's Bid is closely competitive as
defined by guidelines to be established by the Contract Compliance Director with that of lowest actual
Bids, direct the CPO to declare the PCE the successful Bidder. A PCE may use this procedure only once
to become the successful Bidder on any particular item. Thereafter, the PCE must be totally competitive
in terms of price to be the successful Bidder.
(2) The Contract Compliance Director shall develop and coordinate a target market program as follows:
a.

The Contract Compliance Director shall review the availability of PCEs providing various goods
and services and shall identify for inclusion in a potential program for bidding among PCE Persons

Requests for Qualifications, and Requests for Proposals among PCE Persons. The Contract
Compliance Director shall report his/her findings and recommendations to the Contract Compliance
Committee;
b.

c.

Upon a determination by the CCD that such a program is advisable for any particular
commoditysupplies, equipment, goods or services procurement, the Contract Compliance Director
will institute the following procedures:
1.

The Contract Compliance Director will notify the CPO of identification of those
commoditysupplies, equipment, goods, services, or North American Industry Classification
Standard (NAICS) codes appropriate for a target market program;

2.

To the extent practicable, the CPO, with the aid of the Contract Compliance Director, shall
divide procurement in the designated commoditysupplies, equipment, goods or services areas
into economically feasible sizes to facilitate Bids, Requests for Qualifications, or Requests for
Proposals or offers from PCEs and shall designate contracts to be offered under the target
market program;

3.

The CPO shall offer PCEs the opportunity to bid on such contracts, or submit responses or
proposals, in a limited competition;

4.

All standard County procurement rules for bidding, Requests for Qualifications, or Requests
for Proposals, will then become effective and, provided that at least three PCEs Bid or submit
responses or proposals make an offer on the contract, the lowest Responsive and Responsible
Bidder, Proposer, or Respondent among the PCEs will receive the contract;

5.

In the event less than three PCEs Bid or submit responses or proposals pursuant to a Request
for Qualifications or Request for Proposalsmake an offer on the Contract, or in the event that
if there is no Responsive Bid or best and final Response or Proposal offer received from a
Responsible PCE, the CPO shall rebid the Contract or reissue the Request for Qualifications
or Request for Proposals not subject to the target market program.

Participation in the target market program shall be limited to Minority Business Enterprises,
Women's Business Enterprises and Joint Ventures consisting exclusively of Minority Business
Enterprises, Women's Business Enterprises or both. The PCE Contractor on a target market
Contract may subcontract up to 49 percent of the dollar value of the target market Contract to
subcontractors who are not Minority Business Enterprises or Women's Business Enterprises.

Sec. 34-274. Prompt payment of PCEs.
If an invoice from a Contractor includes payment for supplies, equipment, goods or services furnished by a
PCE, Contractor shall pay such PCE for such supplies, equipment, goods or services within 3015 days after
receipt of payment from the County. The CCD shall investigate any complaint or charge of excessive delay in
payment, and shall report the results of such investigations to the Contract Compliance Committee and to the

The owner(s) must enjoy the customary incidents of ownership and share in the risks and profits
commensurate with that ownership interest.
(2) The contributions of capital or Expertise by the Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) to
acquire the ownership interest must be real and substantial and in accord with generally accepted
industry standards. If Expertise is relied upon as part of a Socially and Economically Disadvantaged
owner's contribution to acquire ownership, the Expertise must be of the requisite quality generally
recognized in a specialized field, in areas critical to the firm's operations, indispensable to the firm's
potential success, specific to the type of work the firm performs and documented in the firm's records.
The individual whose Expertise is relied upon must have a commensurate financial investment in the
firm.
(c) Only a firm that is managed and controlled by a Socially and Economically Disadvantaged person(s) may be
certified as an MBE or WBE.
(1) A firm must not be subject to any formal or informal restrictions that limit the customary discretion of
the Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s). There can be no restrictions through corporate
charter provisions, by-law provisions, contracts or any other formal or informal devices that prevent the
Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s), without the cooperation or vote of any
non-Socially and Economically Disadvantaged person, from making any business decision of the firm,
including the making of obligations or the disbursing of funds.
(2) The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) must possess the power to direct or cause the
direction of the management and policies of the firm and to make day-to-day as well as long-term
decisions on management, policy, operations and work.

and critically evaluate information presented by other participants in the firm's activities and to make
independent decisions concerning the firm's daily operations, work, management, and policymaking.
(5) If federal, state and/or local laws, regulations or statutes require the owner(s) to have a particular license
or other credential to own and/or control a certain type of firm, then the Socially and Economically
Disadvantaged owner(s) must possess the required license or credential. If state law, County ordinance
or other law regulations or statute does not require that the owner possess the license or credential, that
the owner(s) lacks such license or credential is a factor, but is not dispositive, in determining whether
the Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) actually controls the firm.

business interests that conflict with the management of the firm or prevent the owner from devoting
sufficient time and attention to the affairs of the firm to manage and control its day-to-day activities.

viability does not depend on its relationship with another firmPerson, and who has the capacity or ability to
successfully undertake and complete the relevant work. Recognition of an applicant as a separate entity for

tax or corporate purposes is not necessarily sufficient to demonstrate that a firm is independent and
non-Affiliated. In determining whether an applicant is an independent Business, the CC Director will:
(1) Scrutinize relationships with non-Certified Firms in such areas as personnel, facilities, equipment,
financial and/or bonding support, and other resources.
(2) Consider whether present or recent employer/employee relationships between the Socially and
Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) of the applicant and non-Certified Firms or persons associated
with non-Certified Firms compromise the applicant's independence.
(3) Examine the applicant's relationships with non-Certified Firms to determine whether a pattern of
exclusive or primary dealings with non-Certified Firm compromises the applicant's independence.
(4) Consider the consistency of relationships between the applicant and non-Certified Firms with normal
industry practice.
(e) The CCD shall certify only Persons that meet all the above criteria. An applicant shall be certified only for
specific types of work in which the Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) has the ability and
Expertise to manage and control the firmperson's operations and work.
(f) The County shall certify the eligibility of Joint Ventures involving MBEs or WBEs and non-Certified Firms,
provided that the Joint Venture meets the criteria for certification as an MBE or WBE. To be considered an
eligible Joint Venture, at least one partner of the Joint Venture must be a Certified Firm, with a share in the
capital contribution, control, management, risks, and profits of the Joint Venture which is equal to its
ownership interest. Each Certified Firm partner must contribute property, capital, efforts, skill and
knowledge and be responsible for a distinct, clearly defined portion of the work of the contract. Joint
Ventures must have an agreement in writing specifying the terms and conditions of the relationships between
the partners and their relationship and responsibility to the contract.
(g) In lieu of conducting its own certifications, the CC Director by rule may accept formal certifications by other
entities as meeting the requirements of the Program, if the CC Director determines that the certification
standards of such entities are comparable to those of the County.
(h) The certification status of all MBEs and WBEs shall be reviewed periodically by the Office of Contract
Compliance. Failure of the firm to seek recertification by filing the necessary documentation with the CC
Director as provided by rule may result in decertification.
(i)

affecting its continued eligibility for the Program, including decertification by another agency. Failure to do
so may result in the firm's decertification.

(j)

The CC Director shall decertify a firm that does not continuously meet the eligibility criteria.

(k) Disqualification pursuant to Division 4 of the Procurement Code shall create a prima facie case for
decertification by the County. The challenged PCE shall have the burden of proving that its County
certification should be maintained.

anticipated subcontracting functions of the project and the County's utilization of MBEs and WBEs to date.
Sec. 34-296. Counting MBE and WBE participation.
(a) The entire amount of that portion of a contract that is performed by the MBE's or WBE's own forces shall be
counted, including the cost of supplies and materials obtained by the MBE or WBE for the work on the
contract, and supplies purchased or equipment leased by the MBE or WBE (except supplies and equipment
the MBE or WBE purchases or leases from the prime Contractor or the prime Contractor's Affiliate).
(b) The entire amount of fees or commissions charged by an MBE or WBE for providing a bona fide service,
such as professional, technical, consultant or managerial services, or for providing bonds or insurance
specifically required for the performance of a contract, shall be counted, provided the fee is reasonable and
not excessive as compared with fees customarily charged for similar services.
(c) When an MBE or WBE performs as a participant in a Joint Venture, only the portion of the total dollar value
of the contract equal to the distinct, clearly defined portion of the work of the Joint Venture's contract that is
performed by the MBE or WBE with its own forces and for which it is separately at risk, shall be counted.
(d) Only expenditures to an MBE or WBE that is performing a Commercially Useful Function shall be counted.
To determine whether an MBE or WBE is performing a Commercially Useful Function, the County will
evaluate the amount of work subcontracted, industry practices, whether the amount the MBE or WBE is to be
paid under the contract is commensurate with the work it is actually performing and other relevant factors.
To perform a Commercially Useful Function, the MBE or WBE must be responsible, with respect to
materials and supplies used on the contract, for negotiating price, determining quality and quantity, ordering
the material, installing (where applicable) and paying for the material itself. An MBE or WBE does not
perform a Commercially Useful Function if its role is limited to that of an extra participant in the contract
through which funds are passed in order to obtain the appearance of MBE or WBE participation. If an MBE
or WBE subcontracts a greater portion of the work of a contract than would be expected based on normal

industry practice, it is presumed not to perform a Commercially Useful Function. When an MBE or WBE is
presumed not to be performing a Commercially Useful Function, the Certified Firm may present evidence to
rebut this presumption.
(e) One hundred percent of the cost of the materials or supplies obtained from an MBE or WBE Manufacturer or
Regular Dealer shall be counted. One hundred percent of the fees or transportation charges for the delivery of
materials or supplies required on a job site shall be counted only if the payment of such fees is a customary
industry practice and are commensurate with fees customarily charged for similar services.
(f) One hundred percent of the cost of the supplies, equipment or goods obtained from a PCE Manufacturer shall
be counted.
(fg) Sixty percent of the cost of the supplies, equipment or goods obtained from a PCE Distributor or Regular
Dealer shall be counted.
(fh)If a firm ceases to be a Certified Firm for any other reason than graduation from the M/WBE Construction
Program during its performance on a contract, the dollar value of work performed under a contract with that
firm after it has ceased to be certified shall not be counted.
(gi) In determining achievement of Project Specific Goals, the participation of an MBE or WBE shall not be
counted until that amount has been paid to the MBE or WBE.
Sec. 34-297. Contract pre-award compliance procedures.
(a) For all solicitations, the bidder/proposer shall submit a Utilization Plan detailing all subcontractors from
which the Contractor solicited bids or quotations, and if Project Specific Goals have been established, its
achievement of the Goals or its Good Faith Efforts to do so. The Utilization Plan shall be due at the time the
bid/proposal is due.
(b) Any agreement between a Contractor and an MBE or WBE in which the Contractor requires that the MBE or
WBE not provide subcontracting quotations to other Contractors is prohibited.
(c) Where the Contractor cannot achieve the Project Specific Goal(s), the CC Director will determine whether
the Contractor has made Good Faith Efforts to meet the Goal(s). In making this determination, the Director
will consider, at a minimum, the Contractor's efforts to:
(1) Solicit through all reasonable and available means (e.g., attendance at pre-bid meetings, advertising and
written notices) the interest of all MBEs and WBEs certified in the scopes of work of the contract. The
Contractor shall provide interested MBEs and WBEs with timely, adequate information about the plans,
specifications, and requirements of the contract to allow MBEs and WBEs to respond to the solicitation.
The Contractor must follow up initial solicitations with interested MBEs and WBEs.
(2) Select portions of the work to be performed by MBEs and WBEs in order to increase the likelihood that
the Project Specific Goals will be achieved. This includes, where appropriate, breaking out contract
work items into economically feasible units to facilitate MBE and WBE participation, even when the
Contractor would otherwise prefer to perform these work items with its own forces. It is the Contractor's
responsibility to make a portion of the work available to MBEs and WBEs and to select those portions
of the work or material needs consistent with the availability [of] MBEs and WBEs to facilitate their
participation.

 Board of Commissioners

(3) Negotiate in good faith with interested MBEs and WBEs. Evidence of such negotiation includes the
names, addresses, and telephone numbers of MBEs and WBEs that were contacted; a description of the
information provided regarding the plans and specifications for the work selected for subcontracting;
and why agreements could not be reached with MBEs and WBEs. The Contractor may not reject MBEs
and WBEs as being unqualified without sound reasons based on a thorough investigation of their
capabilities. That there may be some additional costs involved in finding and using MBEs and WBEs is
not in itself sufficient reason for a Contractor's failure to meet the Project Specific Goals, as long as
such costs are reasonable. The ability or desire of a Contractor to perform the work of a contract with its
own organization does not relieve it of the responsibility to make Good Faith Efforts on all scopes of
work that could be subcontracted.
(4) Make efforts to assist interested MBEs and WBEs in obtaining bonding, lines of credit, or insurance as
required by the County or the prime Contractor, where appropriate.
(5) Make efforts to assist interested MBEs and WBEs in obtaining necessary equipment, supplies,
materials, or related assistance or services, where appropriate.
(6) Use the services of the Office of Contract Compliance, available minority/women community
organizations, minority/women contractors' groups, government-sponsored minority/women business
assistance offices and other appropriate organizations to provide assistance in the recruitment and
placement of MBEs and WBEs.
(d) In determining whether a Contractor has made Good Faith Efforts, the performance of other Contractors in
meeting the Project Specific Goals may be considered. For example, when the apparent successful
Contractor fails to meet the Project Specific Goals but others meet it, it may be reasonably questioned
whether, with additional reasonable efforts, the apparent successful Contractor could have met the Project
Specific Goals. Similarly, if the apparent successful Contractor fails to meet the Project Specific Goals, but
meets or exceeds the average MBE or WBE participation obtained by other Contractors, this may be
evidence that the apparent successful Contractor made Good Faith Efforts.
(e) A signed letter of intent from each listed MBE or WBE, describing the work, materials, equipment or
services to be performed or provided by the MBE or WBE and the agreed upon dollar value shall be due at
the time of bid proposal or within three days after such submission.
(f) The CC Director shall timely review the Utilization Plan before award, including the scope of work and the
letters of intent from MBEs and WBEs. The CC Director may request clarification in writing of items listed
in the Utilization Plan, provided such clarification shall not include the opportunity to augment listed
participation or Good Faith Efforts.
(g) If the CC Director determines that the Utilization Plan demonstrates that the Project Specific Goals have
been achieved or Good Faith Efforts made, with the concurrence of the User Department, the CC Director
and User Department shall recommend award to Purchasing Agent.
(h) If the CC Director finds that a Contractor did not make sufficient Good Faith Efforts, the CC Director shall
communicate this finding to the Purchasing Department and recommend that the bid/proposal be rejected. A
Contractor may protest this determination pursuant to the County's bid protest procedures.
Sec. 34-298. Contract administration procedures.

become covenants of performance by the Contractors and incorporated in the contract.

detailed subcontractor information to the County with each request for payment submitted to the County or
as otherwise directed by the County. The CC Director and the User Department shall monitor subcontractor
participation during the course of the contract. The County shall have full and timely access to the
Contractor's books and records, including, without limitation, payroll records, tax returns and records and
books of account, to determine the Contractor's compliance with its commitment to MBE and WBE
participation and the status of any MBE or WBE performing any portion of the contract. This provision shall
be in addition to, and not a substitute for, any other provision allowing inspection of the Contractor's records
by any officer or official of the County for any purpose.
(c) The Contractor cannot make changes to the Utilization Plan or substitute MBEs or WBEs named in the
Utilization Plan without the prior written approval of the CC Director, Purchasing Agent and the User
Department. Unauthorized changes or substitutions shall be a violation of this subdivision and a breach of
contract, and may constitute grounds for rejection of the bid or proposal or cause termination of the executed
contract for breach, the withholding of payment and/or subject the Contractor to contract penalties or other
sanctions.
(1) All requests for changes or substitutions of an MBE or WBE Subcontractor(s) named in the Utilization
Plan shall be made to the CC Director, Purchasing Agent and the User Department in writing, and shall
clearly and fully set forth the basis for the request. A Contractor shall not substitute an MBE or WBE
subcontractor or perform the work designated for an MBE or WBE subcontractor with its own forces
unless and until the CC Director, Purchasing Agent in consultation with the User Department, approves
such substitution in writing. A Contractor shall not allow a substituted subcontractor to begin work until
the Director, Purchasing Agent and the User Department have approved the substitution.
(2) The facts supporting the request must not have been known nor reasonably should have been known by
either party before the submission of the Utilization Plan. Bid shopping is prohibited. The Contractor
must negotiate with the MBE or WBE subcontractor to resolve the problem. Where there has been a
mistake or disagreement about the scope of work, the MBE or WBE can be substituted only where an
agreement cannot be reached for a reasonable price for the correct scope of work.
(3) Substitutions of the subcontractor shall be permitted only on the following bases:
(i)
(ii)
(iii)
(iv)
(v)

Unavailability after receipt of reasonable notice to proceed.
Failure of performance.
Financial incapacity.
Refusal by the subcontractor to honor the bid or proposal price.
Mistake of fact or law about the elements of the scope of work of a solicitation where agreement
upon a reasonable price cannot be reached.
(vi) Failure of the subcontractor to meet insurance, licensing or bonding requirements; or
(vii) The subcontractor's withdrawal of its bid or proposal.
(4) The final decision whether to permit or deny the proposed substitution, and the basis of any denial, shall
be communicated to the parties in writing by the CC Director.
(5) Where the Contractor has established the basis for the substitution to the satisfaction of the County, the

the protestor believes the bid procedure was unfair, including a statement of how the alleged unfairness prejudiced
the protesting Bidder and the action requested of the CPO. A bid protest based on an issue which could have
been clarified through a request for clarification or information pursuant to Section 34-136(d), Communications
with the County regarding competitive bidding process, will not be considered if the protesting Bidder failed to
make such request. When a bid protest has been submitted, no further action shall be taken on the Procurement

promptly will unduly delay delivery or performance or cause other undue harm.
The CPO shall issue a written decision on the bid protest to the protesting Bidder and to any other Bidder
affected by such decision as soon as reasonably practicable. If the bid protest is upheld based on a lack of
fairness in the bid procedure, the CPO shall re-bid the procurement. If the CPO determines that the

Sec. 34-138. Requests for qualifications or proposals.
(a)Criteria for use of request for qualifications or proposals. The CPO in consultation with the Using

appropriate include, but are not limited to: Procurements involving services requiring a high degree of
professional skill where the ability or fitness of the Person plays an important part; Procurements where the
requirements are not clearly known; Procurements where quality rather than quantity is a primary factor; and
Procurements where it is not in the best interest of the County to make price a primary determinative factor. An
RFP process is a competitive process under this Procurement Code, and a Person selected through an RFP process
is not considered a "sole source".
(b)Content of RFQs and RFPs. The CPO shall determine what provisions RFQs and RFPs should
contain in consultation with the requesting Using Agency and will incorporate the necessary details, provisions
and requirements for the RFQ or RFP. RFQs and RFPs shall include a provision stating that the County may

Proposers shall be available to the public after the Procurement has been completed.
(e)Evaluation and Selection for Contract Negotiation. The CPO in coordination with the Using Agency
shall develop evaluation criteria which are included in the RFQ or RFP. These criteria may include, but are not
limited to, experience and qualifications of the Respondent or Proposer, the quality, content and completeness of
the Response or Proposal, the demonstrated willingness and ability of the Respondent or Proposer to satisfy the
requirements as described in the RFQ or RFP, and, if applicable, the cost proposal. The evaluation shall be
performed by a committee chaired by the CPO or a designee of the CPO with representatives of the Using Agency
and other persons designated by the CPO. Respondents or Proposers shall be accorded fair treatment with regard

presentations and/or submit clarifications or revisions to their Responses or Proposals for the purpose of obtaining
best and final Responses or Proposals. The Using Agency shall document the results of the evaluation. The
contents of the Responses or Proposals shall not be disclosed to competing Respondents or Proposers during the
evaluation process or any discussions.
(f)Contract negotiation, approval and Execution. The Using Agency may send its recommendation to
the CPO, setting forth the reasons for such recommendation, which shall be based upon the evaluation criteria.
Board approval is not required to negotiate a Contract. Negotiation of a Contract's terms shall take place
between the prospective Contractor(s) and representatives of the Purchasing Department and the Using Agency.
After a Contract is negotiated, the CPO shall either Execute the Contract, if within the CPO's authority, or forward

submit a protest in writing and directed to the CPO. For all Contracts requiring Board approval, any protest must
be submitted no later than three business days after the date upon which the CPO posts the recommended contract
for award. For all Contracts which can be executed by the CPO, any protest must be submitted no later than
three business days after the date upon which the CPO posts the recommended Contract for execution. The
subject of the protest for any RFP or RFQ shall concern fraud, corruption or illegal acts undermining the
objectives and integrity of the procurement process. Any RFP or RFQ protest must be submitted no later than
three business days after the date upon which the CPO posts the recommended Response or Proposal for award.
The protest must contain a detailed statement of the factual and legal grounds of the protest, including all relevant
documents and exhibits that demonstrate fraud, corruption or illegal acts having the effect of undermining the
integrity of the procurement process and the action requested of the CPO. A protest based on an issue which
could have been clarified through a request for clarification or information, will not be considered if the protestor
failed to make such request. When a protest has been submitted, no further action shall be taken on the
Procurement until the CPO makes a decision. The CPO shall issue a written decision on the protest to the
protestor and to any other Respondent or Proposer affected by such decision as soon as reasonably practicable. If
the protest is upheld, the CPO shall consult with the Using Agency, and may exercise any of the following
remedies: cancel the procurement; recommend commencing contractual negotiations to the next qualified
Respondent or Proposer, or re-issue the RFP or RFQ.
(h) Board or CPO related action. Upon resolution of any protests, or expiration of the three-day protest
period with no protests, the CPO shall either execute the contract if within his/her authority, or submit the
Contract to the Board, through its Finance Committee, for approval and authorization for the CPO to Execute the
Contract. Once the Contract has been approved by the Board or executed by the CPO, the CPO shall post on the
CPO's website information regarding the Procurement.
Sec. 34-139. Sole source procurements.
Procurements of supplies, equipment, goods or services may be made without use of one of the
competitive processes if there is either only one source or there is a need for the unique or specialized skill,
experience, or ability possessed by a particular source. The Using Agency must submit a letter to the CPO
justifying the sole source Procurement, and provide any other documents or information required by the CPO.
Sec. 34-140. Comparable government procurement.
If a governmental agency has awarded a contract through a competitive method for the same or similar
supplies, equipment, goods or services as that sought by the County, the Procurement may be made from that
vendor at a price or rate at least as favorable as that obtained by that government agency without utilizing a
competitive procurement method set forth in this Procurement Code.

Sec. 34-261. Findings.
(a)The County has heretofore adopted a Minority Business Enterprise Ordinance to ensure that minority
and women's businesses are provided full and equal opportunity to participate in Contracts.
(f)The Supreme Court of the United States in City of Richmond v. Croson, 488 U.S. 469 (1989), has
enunciated certain standards which are necessary to maintain effective affirmative action programs in compliance
with constitutional requirements.
(g)The County is committed to implementing its affirmative action program in conformance with the
United States Supreme Court's decision in City of Richmond v. Croson.
(d)In furtherance of this commitment, and at the direction of the Board, County staff and consultants
conducted an investigation into the scope of any discrimination in County Procurements, and in the award of and
participation in contracts in the metropolitan Chicago economy, the extent to which such discrimination or the
effects thereof has denied and continues to deny minority and women's business enterprises equal opportunity to
participate in Procurements and to recommend the appropriate affirmative action steps to be taken to eliminate
any such discrimination and its continuing effects.
(e)Minority and women's businesses continue to be awarded prime contracts and subcontracts in dollar
amounts that are disproportionately lower than the availability of such businesses willing and able to perform
Contracts.
(f)The County's procurement practices in the past have contributed to the above identified underutilization
of minority and women's businesses on Contracts.
(g)Minority and women's businesses continue to be disadvantaged by discriminatory practices in the local
construction industry and economy when competing for Contracts and in seeking subcontracting opportunities on
such Contracts.
(h)The County was a passive participant in the discriminatory practices of businesses which discriminate
against minority and women's businesses by entering into contracts with such businesses.
(i)Despite its good faith efforts and implementation of previous affirmative action programs, minority and
women's businesses remain at a competitive disadvantage in competing for Contracts and subcontracts.
(j)Race and gender neutral measures or affirmative action programs without numerical goals have not and
are not likely to eliminate the competitive disadvantage of minority and women's businesses in participating in
Contracts due to discrimination in the local economy.
(k)The numerical goals for the participation of minority and women's businesses in Contracts are
commensurate with the availability of minority and women's businesses willing and able to perform County work.

regulations or statute does not require that the owner possess the license or credential, then the

viability does not depend on its relationship with another Person, and who has the capacity or ability to
successfully undertake and complete the relevant work. Recognition of an applicant as a separate entity for tax

whether an applicant is an independent business, the CCD will:
(1)

Scrutinize relationships with non-Certified Persons in such areas as personnel, facilities,
equipment, financial and/or bonding support, and other resources.

(2)

Consider whether present or recent employer/employee relationships between the Socially and
Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) of the applicant and non-Certified Persons associated with
non-Certified Firms compromise the applicant's independence.

(3)

Examine the applicant's relationships with non-Certified Persons to determine whether a pattern
of exclusive or primary dealings with non-Certified Persons compromises the applicant's
independence.

(4)

Consider the consistency of relationships between the applicant and non-Certified Persons with
normal industry practice.

(e)The Person The CCD shall certify only Persons that meet all the above criteria. An applicant shall be
Ccertified only for specific supplies, equipment, goods or services, or for types of work in which the Socially and
Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) has the ability and Expertise to manage and Ccontrol the Person's
operations and work.
(f)The County shall certify the eligibility of Joint Ventures involving MBEs or WBEs and non-Certified
Firms, provided that the Joint Venture meets the criteria for certification as an MBE or WBE. To be considered

(b)Commercially Useful Function. To be considered in meeting Goals, a PCE must perform a
Commercially Useful Function, as determined pursuant to this Subsection 34-269(b). "Commercially Useful
Function" means the performance of a distinct element of work required for the Procurement, with the requisite
skill and Expertise.
(1)

In the case of a Procurement of goods or equipment, ordering from a manufacturer or distributor
for delivery directly to the Using Agency is not a Commercially Useful Function; provided,
however, that to the extent such practice is consistent with normal industry practices, a PCE
subcontractor may enter into second tier subcontracts. However, if a PCE Contractor or
subcontractor subcontracts a significantly greater portion of the work of the Contract than would
be expected on the basis of normal industry practices, the PCE shall be presumed not to be
performing a Commercially Useful Function.

(2)

In the case of a Procurement of services, a Person which subcontracts with another Person to
perform the services required does not perform a Commercially Useful Function unless such
Person also performs significant supervisory or management responsibilities. A Broker does not
fulfill a Commercially Useful Function. In the case of a Joint Venture partner, each Joint
Venture partner must perform a Commercially Useful Function.

(c3)

A PCE does not perform a Commercially Useful Function if its role is limited to that of an extra
participant in the Contract through which funds are passed in order to obtain the appearance of
PCE participation.

(d4)

When a PCE is presumed not to be performing a Commercially Useful Function, the Certified
PCE and the Person seeking to include that PCE in its Utilization Plan, may present evidence to
rebut this presumption.

(e)Once a Utilization Plan has been approved, the Contractor cannot make changes to the Utilization Plan,
including substituting PCEs named in the Utilization Plan, without the prior written approval of the CCD,
CPO and the Using Agency. The CCD shall promulgate procedures for changes to the Utilization Plan.
Sec. 34-270. Methods to achieve goals and compliance.
A Person may achieve the applicable Contract Specific Goals in any one or more of the methods set forth
below. The same PCE, whether as a contractor, subcontractor or supplier, cannot be utilized as both a MBE and
a WBE on the same Contract.
(1)

PCE as prime Contractor. An MBE or WBE may count its own participation toward the
achievement of the applicable MBE or WBE goal. Such PCE will be required to meet the other
goals by another method described herein. If a WBE is also a MBE, such WBE's participation
may count toward either the MBE or WBE Goal but not both.

(2)

Joint Venture with one or more PCE. Where a Person engages in a Joint Venture with one or
more PCEs, the Utilization Plan shall include a written agreement at least the information set
forth in Subsection 34-384(ii)1 through 4 [(2)a. through d.] below. The CCD shall consider the
following in determining whether the proposed Utilization Plan satisfies the Program Goals based
upon such written Joint Venture agreement and the Utilization Plan.

Each Joint Venture partner's initial capital investment;
The extent to which the PCE's proposed participation in the performance of the Contract
constitutes a Commercially Useful Function;
Whether the PCE's share in the risks and profits of the Joint Venture is proportional to
their ownership interest; and
Whether the PCE will have duties, responsibilities, management Control and risk with
respect to the Joint Venture in proportion to its ownership interest.

Subcontracting. A Person may achieve the Contract Specific Goals by means of subcontracting
with, or purchasing from one or more PCEs.

Sec. 34-271. Request for a total or partial waiver; good faith efforts.
(a)In reviewing a partial or total request for waiver of a Goal, the CCD shall determine whether a Person
has made good faith efforts to meet the applicable Goals and to what extent the waiver request should be granted.
In determining whether a Person has made Good faith efforts, the CCD will consider whether the Person has
taken the following actions:
(1)

Review lists of PCEs maintained by the County and other State and local governments and
agencies to identify qualified PCEs for solicitation for Bids;

(2)

Divide Procurement requirements into small tasks or quantities. This shall include, where
appropriate, breaking out Contract work items into economically feasible units, consistent with
the availability of PCEs, to facilitate PCE participation, even when the Contractor would
otherwise prefer to perform these work items with its own forces;

(3)

Adjust any insurance requirements imposed by the Person seeking PCEs, or otherwise assist
PCEs in obtaining any required insurance, where economically feasible, to encourage
participation by PCEs;

(4)

Make timely attempts to contact PCEs providing the type of supplies, equipment, goods or
services required for the Procurement; and provide them with a convenient and timely
opportunity to obtain and review all information concerning the Procurement necessary to enable
such PCE to respond;

(5)

Follow up initial contacts of PCEs to determine if they are interested participating in the
Procurement;

(6)

Negotiate in good faith and on a timely basis with PCEs to enable them to participate in the
Procurement. Evidence of such negotiation includes the names, addresses, and telephone numbers
of PCEs that were contacted; a description of the information provided regarding the plans and
specifications for the work selected for subcontracting; and why agreements could not be reached.
The Contractor may not reject PCEs as being unqualified without sound reasons. That there may
be some additional costs involved in finding and using PCEs is not in itself sufficient reason for a
Contractor's failure to meet the Goals, as long as such costs are reasonable;

 Board of Commissioners

Journal - Final

March 12, 2014

(7)

Make efforts to assist interested PCEs in obtaining necessary equipment, supplies, materials, or
related assistance or services, where appropriate; provided, however, that such efforts shall not be
inconsistent with the requirement that the PCE be responsible for actually obtaining and paying
for such items;

(8)

Establish delivery schedules which will encourage participation by PCEs, where the requirements
of the Procurement permit;

(9)

Use the services and assistance of the CCD's staff, the Small Business Administration, the Office
of Minority Business Enterprises of the U.S. Department of Commerce;

(10)

Timely notify appropriate community and minority and women's business organizations
identified as assist agencies of the opportunity for participation in the Procurement; and

(11)

Demonstrate to the CCD that no PCE exists with which a mentor/protege relationship could be
established, as described in Section 34-271.

(b)In determining whether a Bidder or Respondent has made Good Faith Efforts, the levels of participation
by PCEs set forth in Utilization Plans submitted by other Persons for the same Procurement may be considered.
For example, if the apparent successful Bidder or Respondent fails to meet the Contract Specific Goals, but meets
or exceeds the average PCE participation obtained by other Bidders or Respondents, this may be evidence that the
apparent successful Bidder or Respondent made Good Faith Efforts.
(c)Where the County requires professional services, the County must be able to call upon those
professionals whose particular training and experience are most beneficial to the County.
(1)

The County sets an annual "best efforts" goal of 35 percent PCE participation for the total
professional services and consulting services utilized by the County.

(2)

A Utilization Plan shall be required, and if a waiver or partial waiver is requested, "good faith"
efforts shall be demonstrated as set forth in Section 34-271; provided, however, that such Persons
shall not be required to attempt to subcontract with PCEs if subcontractors would not typically be
utilized for the type of Procurement. In such cases, the Person shall document the reasons for
not subcontracting in a waiver request.

(32)

The Contractor will endeavor to maximize use of PCEs for supplies, equipment, goods or services
for such Contractor's business operations not specifically for the Procurement.

(43)

If such Person is required to have or has an affirmative action plan and goals, such plan and goals
shall be submitted with their Utilization Plan. The CCD shall compare such plan and goals with
the Person's actual affirmative action achievements and such achievements may be considered by
the County in future Procurements.

(d)Mentor/protege agreements. Where a Contractor enters into mentor/protege agreement with a PCE to
improve or develop certain aspects of the business of the PCE, the CCD shall evaluate the effect of such
agreement as a factor in determining good faith efforts. The mentor/protege agreement may provide for the
Contractor to assist the PCE in such areas as technical aspects of the PCE's business, improving financial
management, or providing on-the-job training. To constitute good faith efforts, the mentor/protege agreement
shall satisfy the following requirements.
(1) The PCE performs a Commercially Useful Function;
(2) The agreement shall be included in the Utilization Plan; and
(3) The agreement clearly defines the respective responsibilities of the Contractor and the PCE and includes
specific, measurable goals to be attained by both parties through the performance of the agreement. In
order to be a factor in establishing best efforts, the mentor/protege agreement must be for a reasonable
period of time.
(e) The CCD may grant a total or partial waiver based upon the following criteria:
(1) There are not sufficient PCEs capable of providing the supplies, equipment, goods or services required
for the Procurement;
(2) The Procurement cannot reasonably be divided;
(3) The price required by potential PCEs is more than ten percent above competitive levels; and
(4) Any other factor relating to good faith efforts as set forth in the Person's Utilization Plan.
Sec. 34-272. Calculating PCE participation.
In calculating a PCE's participation, only dollar amounts commensurate with a PCE's performance of a
Commercially Useful Function may be counted.
(a) The dollar value of that portion of a Procurement that is performed by the PCEs' own forces shall be
counted, including the cost of supplies, materials and equipment furnished by the PCE for the Procurement,
whether purchased or leased (except to the extent purchased or leased from the Contractor or the Contractor's
Affiliate).
(b) The dollar amount of fees or commissions charged by a PCE for providing a bona fide service, such as
professional, technical, consultant, managerial, insurance brokerage or surety services, shall be counted, provided
the fee is reasonable and not excessive as compared with fees customarily charged for similar services.
(c) When a PCE is a Joint Venture partner, only the dollar value of the distinct, clearly defined work performed
by the PCE with its own forces, shall be counted.
(d)

Only the dollar value must be commensurate with the work the PCE actually performs.

(e) One hundred percent of the cost of the supplies, equipment or goods obtained from a PCE Manufacturer, or
Distributor, or Regular Dealer shall be counted.

 Board of Commissioners

Journal - Final

March 12, 2014

(f) One hundred percent of the fees or transportation charges for the delivery of supplies, equipment, materials or
goods shall be counted only if the payment of such fees is a customary industry practice and such fees are
commensurate with fees customarily charged for similar services.
(g) If a PCE ceases to be Certified during its performance on a Procurement, the dollar value of work
performed under a Contract with that Person after it has ceased to be Certified shall not be counted.
(h)

Only the dollar amount actually paid to the PCE shall be counted toward the participation of a PCE.

Sec. 34-273. Review of contract performance.
(a) Compliance with Utilization Plan. The CCD shall review the Contractor's compliance with its Utilization
Plan as necessary during the performance of the Contract. The CCD may establish such requirements for
periodic Contractor reporting on compliance with its Utilization Plan as the CCD determines appropriate and
necessary. A Contractor shall be required to provide any additional requested compliance documentation within
14 days of request by the CCD.
(1) If the CCD determines that the Contractor has failed to comply with its Utilization Plan, the CCD shall
notify the CPO of such failure. The CPO shall then send notice of default to the Contractor, and the
Contractor shall have such time to cure the default as is provided in the Contract. If no such period is
provided, the Contractor shall have ten days to cure such default. For purposes of this section,
providing a plan for bringing the Contract into compliance with the Utilization Plan may constitute a
cure, if compliance cannot reasonably be achieved within the applicable cure period, and if compliance
is achieved in accordance with such plan.
(2) If a Contractor fails to provide any documentation required by the CCD, the CCD shall notify the CPO
of such failure. The CPO shall then send notice of default to the Contractor, and the Contractor shall
have such time to cure the default as is provided in the Contract. If no such period is provided, the
Contractor shall have ten days to cure such default.
(b) Bid and target market programs. To address more specifically the barriers to PCE participation as prime
Contractors in County work, the CCD may recommend to the CPO to institute the following special PCE
bidding provisions, following determination of the appropriateness of such provisions.
(1) In connection with the award of a Contract subject to competitive bidding on which a PCE has bid and
where the PCE is bidding on the item in question for the first time; and has never successfully bid on a
Cook County purchasing contract, the Contract Compliance Director may, at the opening of the bids on
the item, compare the PCE Bid with the lowest Bid, and, if the PCE's Bid is closely competitive as
defined by guidelines to be established by the Contract Compliance Director with that of lowest actual
Bids, direct the CPO to declare the PCE the successful Bidder. A PCE may use this procedure only
once to become the successful Bidder on any particular item. Thereafter, the PCE must be totally
competitive in terms of price to be the successful Bidder.
(2) The Contract Compliance Director shall develop and coordinate a target market program as follows:
a.

The Contract Compliance Director shall review the availability of PCEs providing various goods
and services and shall identify for inclusion in a potential program for bidding, Requests for
Qualifications, and Requests for Proposals among PCE Persons certain commodity, goods or
services areas with sufficient PCE availability to ensure that the County receives a competitive
price. The Contract Compliance Director shall report his/her findings and recommendations to the
Contract Compliance Committee;

goods or services procurement, the Contract Compliance Director will institute the following
procedures:
1.

The Contract Compliance Director will notify the CPO of identification of those commodity,
goods, services, or North American Industry Classification Standard (NAICS) codes
appropriate for a target market program;

2.

To the extent practicable, the CPO, with the aid of the Contract Compliance Director, shall
divide procurement in the designated commodity, goods or services areas into economically
feasible sizes to facilitate Bids, Requests for Qualifications, or Requests for Proposals or
offers from PCEs and shall designate contracts to be offered under the target market program;

3.

The CPO shall offer PCEs the opportunity to bid on such contracts, or submit responses or
proposals, in a limited competition;

4.

All standard County procurement rules for bidding, Requests for Qualifications, or Requests
for Proposals, will then become effective and, provided that at least three PCEs Bid or submit
responses or proposals make an offer on the contract, the lowest Responsive and Responsible
Bidder, Proposer, or Respondent among the PCEs will receive the contract; and

5.

In the event less than three PCEs Bid or submit responses or proposals pursuant to a Request
for Qualifications or Request for Proposalsmake an offer on the Contract, or in the event that
if there is no Responsive Bid or best and final Response or Proposal offer received from a
Responsible PCE, the CPO shall rebid the Contract or reissue the Request for Qualifications
or Request for Proposals not subject to the target market program.

Participation in the target market program shall be limited to Minority Business Enterprises,
Women's Business Enterprises and Joint Ventures consisting exclusively of Minority Business
Enterprises, Women's Business Enterprises or both. The PCE Contractor on a target market
Contract may subcontract up to 49 percent of the dollar value of the target market Contract to
subcontractors who are not Minority Business Enterprises or Women's Business Enterprises.

Sec. 34-274. Prompt payment of PCEs.
If an invoice from a Contractor includes payment for supplies, equipment, goods or services furnished by a
PCE, Contractor shall pay such PCE for such supplies, equipment, goods or services within 3015 days after
receipt of payment from the County. The CCD shall investigate any complaint or charge of excessive delay in
payment, and shall report the results of such investigations to the Contract Compliance Committee and to the
County Comptroller. Failure of Contractor to comply with this section 34-388 shall constitute a material breach of
the Contract.

and continuing, going beyond pro forma ownership of the firm as reflected in ownership documents.
The owner(s) must enjoy the customary incidents of ownership and share in the risks and profits
commensurate with that ownership interest.
(2) The contributions of capital or Expertise by the Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) to
acquire the ownership interest must be real and substantial and in accord with generally accepted
industry standards. If Expertise is relied upon as part of a Socially and Economically Disadvantaged
owner's contribution to acquire ownership, the Expertise must be of the requisite quality generally

Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s), without the cooperation or vote of any
non-Socially and Economically Disadvantaged person, from making any business decision of the firm,
including the making of obligations or the disbursing of funds.
(2) The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) must possess the power to direct or cause the
direction of the management and policies of the firm and to make day-to-day as well as long-term
decisions on management, policy, operations and work.
(3) The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) may delegate various areas of the management
or daily operations of the firm to persons who are not Socially and Economically Disadvantaged. Such
delegations of authority must be revocable, and the Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s)
must retain the power to hire and fire any such person. The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged
owner(s) must actually exercise control over the firm's operations, work, management and policy.
(4) The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) must have an overall understanding of, and
managerial and technical competence, experience and Expertise directly related to, the firm's operations

or other credential to own and/or control a certain type of firm, then the Socially and Economically
Disadvantaged owner(s) must possess the required license or credential. If state law, County ordinance
or other law regulations or statute does not require that the owner possess the license or credential, that
the owner(s) lacks such license or credential is a factor, but is not dispositive, in determining whether
the Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) actually controls the firm.

business interests that conflict with the management of the firm or prevent the owner from devoting
sufficient time and attention to the affairs of the firm to manage and control its day-to-day activities.
(d) Only an independent firm may be certified as an MBE or WBE. An independent firmPerson is one whose
viability does not depend on its relationship with another firmPerson, and who has the capacity or ability to
successfully undertake and complete the relevant work. Recognition of an applicant as a separate entity for
tax or corporate purposes is not necessarily sufficient to demonstrate that a firm is independent and
non-Affiliated. In determining whether an applicant is an independent Business, the CC Director will:
(1) Scrutinize relationships with non-Certified Firms in such areas as personnel, facilities, equipment,
financial and/or bonding support, and other resources.
(2) Consider whether present or recent employer/employee relationships between the Socially and
Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) of the applicant and non-Certified Firms or persons associated
with non-Certified Firms compromise the applicant's independence.
(3) Examine the applicant's relationships with non-Certified Firms to determine whether a pattern of
exclusive or primary dealings with non-Certified Firm compromises the applicant's independence.
(4) Consider the consistency of relationships between the applicant and non-Certified Firms with normal
industry practice.

(kl)
Decertification by another agency shall create a prima facie case for decertification by the County. The
challenged firm shall have the burden of proving that its County certification should be maintained.

Sec. 34-295. Project specific goals.
The CC Director, in consultation with the User Department, shall establish Project Specific Goals for
construction Contracts based upon the availability of at least three MBEs and three WBEs to perform the
anticipated subcontracting functions of the project and the County's utilization of MBEs and WBEs to date.
Sec. 34-296. Counting MBE and WBE participation.
(a) The entire amount of that portion of a contract that is performed by the MBE's or WBE's own forces shall
be counted, including the cost of supplies and materials obtained by the MBE or WBE for the work on the
contract, and supplies purchased or equipment leased by the MBE or WBE (except supplies and equipment the
MBE or WBE purchases or leases from the prime Contractor or the prime Contractor's Affiliate).
(b) The entire amount of fees or commissions charged by an MBE or WBE for providing a bona fide service,
such as professional, technical, consultant or managerial services, or for providing bonds or insurance specifically
required for the performance of a contract, shall be counted, provided the fee is reasonable and not excessive as
compared with fees customarily charged for similar services.
(c) When an MBE or WBE performs as a participant in a Joint Venture, only the portion of the total dollar
value of the contract equal to the distinct, clearly defined portion of the work of the Joint Venture's contract that is
performed by the MBE or WBE with its own forces and for which it is separately at risk, shall be counted.
(d) Only expenditures to an MBE or WBE that is performing a Commercially Useful Function shall be counted.
To determine whether an MBE or WBE is performing a Commercially Useful Function, the County will evaluate
the amount of work subcontracted, industry practices, whether the amount the MBE or WBE is to be paid under
the contract is commensurate with the work it is actually performing and other relevant factors. To perform a
Commercially Useful Function, the MBE or WBE must be responsible, with respect to materials and supplies
used on the contract, for negotiating price, determining quality and quantity, ordering the material, installing
(where applicable) and paying for the material itself. An MBE or WBE does not perform a Commercially Useful
Function if its role is limited to that of an extra participant in the contract through which funds are passed in order
to obtain the appearance of MBE or WBE participation. If an MBE or WBE subcontracts a greater portion of the
work of a contract than would be expected based on normal industry practice, it is presumed not to perform a
Commercially Useful Function. When an MBE or WBE is presumed not to be performing a Commercially
Useful Function, the Certified Firm may present evidence to rebut this presumption.
(e) One hundred percent of the cost of the materials or supplies obtained from an MBE or WBE Manufacturer
or Regular Dealer shall be counted. One hundred percent of the fees or transportation charges for the delivery of
materials or supplies required on a job site shall be counted only if the payment of such fees is a customary
industry practice and are commensurate with fees customarily charged for similar services.
(k) One hundred percent of the cost of the supplies, equipment or goods obtained from a PCE Manufacturer
shall be counted.
(fg) Sixty percent of the cost of the supplies, equipment or goods obtained from a PCE Distributor or Regular
Dealer shall be counted.
(fh)If a firm ceases to be a Certified Firm for any other reason than graduation from the M/WBE Construction
Program during its performance on a contract, the dollar value of work performed under a contract with that firm
after it has ceased to be certified shall not be counted.

(gi) In determining achievement of Project Specific Goals, the participation of an MBE or WBE shall not be
counted until that amount has been paid to the MBE or WBE.
Sec. 34-297. Contract pre-award compliance procedures.
(a) For all solicitations, the bidder/proposer shall submit a Utilization Plan detailing all subcontractors from
which the Contractor solicited bids or quotations, and if Project Specific Goals have been established, its
achievement of the Goals or its Good Faith Efforts to do so. The Utilization Plan shall be due at the time the
bid/proposal is due.
(b) Any agreement between a Contractor and an MBE or WBE in which the Contractor requires that the MBE
or WBE not provide subcontracting quotations to other Contractors is prohibited.

(c) Where the Contractor cannot achieve the Project Specific Goal(s), the CC Director will determine whether
the Contractor has made Good Faith Efforts to meet the Goal(s). In making this determination, the Director will
consider, at a minimum, the Contractor's efforts to:
(1) Solicit through all reasonable and available means (e.g., attendance at pre-bid meetings, advertising and
written notices) the interest of all MBEs and WBEs certified in the scopes of work of the contract. The
Contractor shall provide interested MBEs and WBEs with timely, adequate information about the plans,
specifications, and requirements of the contract to allow MBEs and WBEs to respond to the solicitation.
The Contractor must follow up initial solicitations with interested MBEs and WBEs.
(2) Select portions of the work to be performed by MBEs and WBEs in order to increase the likelihood that
the Project Specific Goals will be achieved. This includes, where appropriate, breaking out contract
work items into economically feasible units to facilitate MBE and WBE participation, even when the
Contractor would otherwise prefer to perform these work items with its own forces. It is the
Contractor's responsibility to make a portion of the work available to MBEs and WBEs and to select
those portions of the work or material needs consistent with the availability [of] MBEs and WBEs to
facilitate their participation.
(3) Negotiate in good faith with interested MBEs and WBEs. Evidence of such negotiation includes the
names, addresses, and telephone numbers of MBEs and WBEs that were contacted; a description of the
information provided regarding the plans and specifications for the work selected for subcontracting;
and why agreements could not be reached with MBEs and WBEs. The Contractor may not reject
MBEs and WBEs as being unqualified without sound reasons based on a thorough investigation of their
capabilities. That there may be some additional costs involved in finding and using MBEs and WBEs
is not in itself sufficient reason for a Contractor's failure to meet the Project Specific Goals, as long as
such costs are reasonable. The ability or desire of a Contractor to perform the work of a contract with its
own organization does not relieve it of the responsibility to make Good Faith Efforts on all scopes of
work that could be subcontracted.
(4) Make efforts to assist interested MBEs and WBEs in obtaining bonding, lines of credit, or insurance as
required by the County or the prime Contractor, where appropriate.
(5) Make efforts to assist interested MBEs and WBEs in obtaining necessary equipment, supplies,
materials, or related assistance or services, where appropriate.
(6) Use the services of the Office of Contract Compliance, available minority/women community
organizations, minority/women contractors' groups, government-sponsored minority/women business
assistance offices and other appropriate organizations to provide assistance in the recruitment and
placement of MBEs and WBEs.
(d) In determining whether a Contractor has made Good Faith Efforts, the performance of other Contractors in
meeting the Project Specific Goals may be considered. For example, when the apparent successful Contractor
fails to meet the Project Specific Goals but others meet it, it may be reasonably questioned whether, with
additional reasonable efforts, the apparent successful Contractor could have met the Project Specific Goals.
Similarly, if the apparent successful Contractor fails to meet the Project Specific Goals, but meets or exceeds the
average MBE or WBE participation obtained by other Contractors, this may be evidence that the apparent
successful Contractor made Good Faith Efforts.

(e) A signed letter of intent from each listed MBE or WBE, describing the work, materials, equipment or
services to be performed or provided by the MBE or WBE and the agreed upon dollar value shall be due at the
time of bid proposal or within three days after such submission.
(f) The CC Director shall timely review the Utilization Plan before award, including the scope of work and the
letters of intent from MBEs and WBEs. The CC Director may request clarification in writing of items listed in
the Utilization Plan, provided such clarification shall not include the opportunity to augment listed participation or
Good Faith Efforts.
(g) If the CC Director determines that the Utilization Plan demonstrates that the Project Specific Goals have
been achieved or Good Faith Efforts made, with the concurrence of the User Department, the CC Director and
User Department shall recommend award to Purchasing Agent.
(h) If the CC Director finds that a Contractor did not make sufficient Good Faith Efforts, the CC Director shall
communicate this finding to the Purchasing Department and recommend that the bid/proposal be rejected. A
Contractor may protest this determination pursuant to the County's bid protest procedures.
Sec. 34-298. Contract administration procedures.
(a) Upon award of a contract by the County that includes Project Specific Goals, the Project Specific Goals
become covenants of performance by the Contractors and incorporated in the contract.
(b) The Contractor shall provide a listing of all subcontractors to be used in the performance of the contract,
and detailed subcontractor information to the County with each request for payment submitted to the County or as
otherwise directed by the County. The CC Director and the User Department shall monitor subcontractor
participation during the course of the contract. The County shall have full and timely access to the Contractor's
books and records, including, without limitation, payroll records, tax returns and records and books of account, to
determine the Contractor's compliance with its commitment to MBE and WBE participation and the status of any
MBE or WBE performing any portion of the contract. This provision shall be in addition to, and not a substitute
for, any other provision allowing inspection of the Contractor's records by any officer or official of the County for
any purpose.
(c) The Contractor cannot make changes to the Utilization Plan or substitute MBEs or WBEs named in the
Utilization Plan without the prior written approval of the CC Director, Purchasing Agent and the User
Department. Unauthorized changes or substitutions shall be a violation of this subdivision and a breach of
contract, and may constitute grounds for rejection of the bid or proposal or cause termination of the executed
contract for breach, the withholding of payment and/or subject the Contractor to contract penalties or other
sanctions.
(1) All requests for changes or substitutions of an MBE or WBE Subcontractor(s) named in the Utilization
Plan shall be made to the CC Director, Purchasing Agent and the User Department in writing, and shall
clearly and fully set forth the basis for the request. A Contractor shall not substitute an MBE or WBE
subcontractor or perform the work designated for an MBE or WBE subcontractor with its own forces
unless and until the CC Director, Purchasing Agent in consultation with the User Department, approves
such substitution in writing. A Contractor shall not allow a substituted subcontractor to begin work
until the Director, Purchasing Agent and the User Department have approved the substitution.

(2) The facts supporting the request must not have been known nor reasonably should have been known by
either party before the submission of the Utilization Plan. Bid shopping is prohibited. The Contractor
must negotiate with the MBE or WBE subcontractor to resolve the problem. Where there has been a
mistake or disagreement about the scope of work, the MBE or WBE can be substituted only where an
agreement cannot be reached for a reasonable price for the correct scope of work.
(3) Substitutions of the subcontractor shall be permitted only on the following bases:

(vii) The subcontractor's withdrawal of its bid or proposal.
(4) The final decision whether to permit or deny the proposed substitution, and the basis of any denial, shall
be communicated to the parties in writing by the CC Director.
(5) Where the Contractor has established the basis for the substitution to the satisfaction of the County, the
Contractor shall make Good Faith Efforts to fulfill the Utilization Plan. The Contractor may seek the
assistance of the Office of Contract Compliance in obtaining a new MBE or WBE. If the Project
Specific Goal(s) cannot be reached and Good Faith Efforts have been made, the Contractor may
substitute with a non-Certified Firm.
(6) If the County requires the substitution of an MBE or WBE subcontractor listed in the Utilization Plan,
the Contractor shall undertake Good Faith Efforts to fulfill the Utilization Plan. The Contractor may
seek the assistance of the Office of Contract Compliance in obtaining a new MBE or WBE
subcontractor. If the Goal(s) cannot be reached and Good Faith Efforts have been made, the Contractor
may substitute with a non-Certified Firm.
(d) If a Contractor plans to hire a subcontractor on any scope of work that was not previously disclosed in the
Utilization Plan, the Contractor shall obtain the approval of the CC Director to modify the Utilization Plan and
must make Good Faith Efforts to ensure that MBEs and WBEs have a fair opportunity to bid on the new scope of
work.
(e) Changes to the scopes of work shall be documented by the User Department at the time they arise to
establish the reasons for the change and the effect on achievement of the MBE or WBE goal.
(f) Prior to contract closeout, the CC Director shall evaluate the Contractor's fulfillment of the contracted goals,
taking into account all approved substitutions, terminations and changes to the contract's scope of work. If the
County determines that Good Faith Efforts to meet the MBE or WBE commitments were not made, or that
fraudulent misrepresentations have been made, or any other breach of the contract or violation of this subdivision,
a remedy or sanction may be imposed, as provided in the contract.

Summary: This improvement, as proposed, will be milling and resurfacing the existing pavement and shall
include full depth patching and pavement widening to provide competent travel lanes, aggregate shoulders, curb
and gutter, pipe culvert replacement, drainage additions and adjustments, ditch regrading, traffic control and
protection, landscaping, pavement marking, engineering and other necessary highway appurtenances.
On 12/21/2005 your Honorable Body approved an Improvement Resolution appropriating $525,000.00 towards
completion of this improvement. At the time of this improvement resolution, the primary scope of the
improvement was limited to milling and resurfacing with full depth patching.
Subsequently, the inadequate pavement width necessitated a change in the scope of work to include pavement
widening. Additional funding is needed for pavement widening to provide competent travel lanes, aggregate
shoulders, curb and gutter, pipe culvert replacement and ditch regrading.

The City of Chicago, Bureau of Fire Protection issued notice in September 2008 to comply with the State of
Illinois rules for abandon and removal of the 5,000 gallon UST after an initial test conducted by Provident
Hospital (July 2008) failed the tank tightness test.
Cook County entered into contract with Clean World Engineering (CWE), LTD., for engineering services, for
removal and replacement of one (1) 5,000 gallon UST. Subsequently the Chicago Fire Department followed up
with the hospital in 2010 and restricted the usage of the second tank (15,000 gallon) due to corroded piping and
possible contamination. After receiving the notification, the County expanded the scope of work to include the
15,000 gallon UST to be removed and replaced.
This additional professional services scope resulted in an increase of $32,320.00 to the project.
