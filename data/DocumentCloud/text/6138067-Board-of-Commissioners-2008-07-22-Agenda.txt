APPROVED AS AMENDED
Transmitting a Communication from
JARESE A. WILSON, Director, Department of Budget and Management Services
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with City Tech, Inc., Chicago,
Illinois, for Phase II III of the budget request and amendment system. Phase II III will consist of
consulting and computer software services to provide continuing technical support and project leadership
for improvements to the existing system.
Reason:

Through a Request for Proposal (RFP) process City Tech, Inc. was selected. The existing
budget request system was originally developed in 1998 and this software is not compatible
with current systems and software used county-wide. This Phase II III enhancement of the
budget request system will give the systems administrator greater monitoring controls, link
several manual databases and interface with the County’s financial management information
system.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $139,100.00 ($69,550.00 per year) (FY 2008: $61,500.00; FY 2009:

Re:

Floodplain Ordinance Amendment

The Department requests your approval of the following Floodplain Ordinance Amendment. The Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) recently completed revisions to the countywide Flood
Insurance Study (FIS) and Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) for Cook County, Illinois and Incorporated
Areas. The Illinois Department of Natural Resources has informed us that to meet the requirements of the
National Flood Insurance Program, Cook County will need to amend Chapter 106, Section 106-5 (3) of
the Cook County Code. Previously, Ordinance Amendment 08-O-31 was approved by the County Board
on April 23, 2008 to reflect the new FIRM effective date of August 19, 2008. This FIS is codicil of the
FIRM and also needs to have the correct effective date of August 19, 2008 according to 44 C.F.R.
60.3(d).

Re:

Shield Complex, LLC Assumption request
Christian Vision Center, Inc. Project No. 07184300076

transmitted herewith is the recommended proposal for the assumption of the HOME Investment
Partnership (HOME) Program loan of Christian Vision Center, Inc. by Shields Complex, LLC. Under the
United States Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) HOME Program, in 2002, Cook
County committed HOME program funds in the amount of $1,179,796.00 for the construction of lowincome housing to serve the needs of formerly homeless individuals and families moving from
transitional housing within Chicago Heights and the surrounding south suburban communities into what
is known as “Woodson Complex” in Chicago Heights. The use of the funds was incorporated into the
County’s Annual Actual Plan to HUD.
The 16 unit, four (4) two-stories, project complied with the Cook County’s Consolidated Plan by
providing decent affordable housing within a suitable living environment and supported the development
of affordable permanent supportive housing for formerly homeless persons.
Christian Vision Center, Inc. is now defunct and Shields Complex, LLC, 100% member owned by
Community and Economic Development Association of Cook County, Inc. (CEDA) desires to assume the
loan and the property management of Christian Vision Center, Inc.
Assumption of the loan will prevent foreclosure by the first lien holder, Illinois Housing Development
Authority (IHDA), allows Cook County to remain in compliance with the twenty year HUD affordability
period, and meet our commitment entailed in the Cook County’s Consolidated Community Development
Plan to ensure decent and affordable rental housing to low and moderate income persons.
I respectfully request approval of the recommended assumption of Christian Vision Center, Inc. loan by
Shields Complex, LLC and I, or the Bureau Chief, Capital, Planning and Facilities Management, or his
designee, be authorized to execute, on behalf of the County of Cook, any and all documents necessary to
further the program approved herein, including, but not limited to, notes, mortgages, agreements, letters,

TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT
ITEM #67
APPROVED AS AMENDED
Transmitting a Communication, dated June 27, 2008 from
RAYMOND MULDOON, Director, Real Estate Management Division
requesting approval of the lease termination agreement between the County of Cook, as Landlord, and the
Cook County Sheriff, (“Tenant”) for office space used by the Child Support Division in the George West
W. Dunne Cook County Office Building located at 69 West Washington, Chicago, Illinois. The Dunne
Building Lease was renewed in 2006 for a five year term expiring June 30, 2011.
The Sheriff has determined that due to changes in operations, the function carried on in the Premises can
be more efficiently performed in a smaller space in a location outside of the central business district.
In the interest of increasing efficiency in the performance of governmental services and reducing
administrative costs, and in the spirit of intergovernmental cooperation, the Sheriff has requested that the
County terminate the Dunne Building Lease early.
Tenant has identified space at the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center currently occupied by another
Sheriff’s function, which can be converted to the use of the Child Support Division.
The relocation of Child Support Division provides for a centralized location for roll calls, easy access for
summon and warrant retrievals, and increased efficiency with the process of service and execution of
child support warrants. The new office space will reduce square footage to approximately 1,134 sq ft
from 6,392.
Approval recommended.
