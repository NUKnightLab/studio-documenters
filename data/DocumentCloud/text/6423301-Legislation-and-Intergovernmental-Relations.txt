or participated personally and substantially in the proceeding during his or her term of office or

(b) No former official or employee shall assist or represent any person in any business transaction
involving the County, if the official or employee participated personally and substantially in that transaction
during his or her term of office or employment.
(c) No former official or employee may, for a period of one year after the termination of his or her
term of office or employment, knowingly accept employment or receive compensation or fees for services
