Vote Result:

MOTION ADOPTED BY VOICE VOTE

b. Medicare Ineligible Cost Impact
Ms. Hawes then presented the recommendation from the Health Benefits Committee
(“HBC”) that in order to be covered by the Fund’s Health Plan, all members be required to
enroll in Medicare when they have attained the age of 65 even if they are ineligible for free
Medicare Part A. She stated that the Fund receives significant cost savings when members
are enrolled in Medicare. The Health Consultant provided analyses that showed the cost
efficiencies from mandating that all members over the age of 65 be enrolled in Medicare,
even if the Fund provides a modest premium credit for member ineligible for free Medicare
Part A. The credit would reduce the member’s CCPF premium and offset most of the cost of
buying Medicare.
It was moved by Trustee Fitzgerald and seconded by Trustee McFadden that the Board adopt
the recommendation made by the Health Benefits Committee at their meeting on September
20, 2018, that effective January 1, 2019, all future plan participants who are ineligible for
free Medicare Part A must purchase Medicare Part A and Part B in order to receive coverage
under the CCPF health plan. It is further moved that the Fund will provide a premium credit
of $123 per month to those members ineligible for free Medicare Part A who enroll in the
CCPF health plan.

 The Director of Health Benefits then reported that the HBC had considered eligibility
requirements for annuitants’ dependents who are enrolled in the health plan. The HBC was
specifically addressing coverage for the wards of an annuitant who had been appointed a

persons who were an annuitant’s biological or adopted children. Any dependents who had
been enrolled prior to January 1, 2019, would be allowed to continue coverage.

the recommendation made by the Health Benefits Committee at their meeting on September
20, 2018, to allow annuitants who were appointed guardians of minors who are currently
enrolled in the CCPF health plan and annuitants whose step children are currently enrolled in
the CCPF health plan to continue coverage for such wards and step children until the age of
26 and, effective January 1, 2019, for new enrollees to only allow coverage for annuitants’
biological or adopted children.

disabled adult on the Fund’s health plan, only if such disabled adult was the biological or
adopted child of the annuitant. Any disabled adult over the age of 26 who was a dependent
of the annuitant and enrolled in the health plan prior to January 1, 2019, would be able to
continue coverage. All such disabled adults would only be allowed to continue coverage so
long as the annuitant was also eligible for health benefits.
It was moved by Trustee Fitzgerald and seconded by Trustee McFadden that the Board adopt
the recommendation made by the Health Benefits Committee at their meeting on September
20, 2018, to allow annuitants who were appointed guardians of disabled adults who are

are currently enrolled in the CCPF health plan to continue coverage for such wards and step
children until the annuitant is no longer enrolled and for new enrollees, effective January 1,

benefits. The member has acknowledged in writing that the amount of $42,919.89 is
owed to the Fund and agreed that any annuity benefits be reduced by a monthly amount
of $1,500 until the amount due has been paid in full. Mr. LeDonne stated that the Fund

and authorize the deduction of $1,500 each month from the annuity payments until the
amount owed the Fund is paid in full.
It was moved by Trustee McFadden and seconded by Trustee Goode, after due
consideration of the application for annuity benefits made by the member identified by

6. Professional Services Procurement Update
a. PAS RFP Status Update
Stephen James of Linea Solutions stated that the Fund had conducted commercially
confidential meetings and site visits for the two respondents with the most favorable
responses to the RFP. He suggested that the next step would be to ask the respondents to
submit their best and final offers and possibly, because of the time commitment required by
Fund staff, to extend the time period for completing the deliverables.
The trustees discussed the need to retain legal representation with experience in negotiating a
contract for the delivery of a pension administration system, particularly so that the
requirements of the system and the responsibilities of the parties are clearly delineated in the
contract terms. The Interim Executive Director was asked to provide some referrals to retain
such counsel in November. The trustees requested that a contract signed by the successful
respondent be submitted to the Board.
