Commissioners:
PROPOSED ORDINANCE
An Ordinance Amending the Definition of Building Height
(Proposed Ordinance Amendment}

Whereas, the definition of building height in the Cook County Building Ordinance is
ambiguous and contradictory on the issue of measuring height in the absence of
curbs; and

Whereas, due to this oversight significant grade changes have become an ongoing
problem in unincorporated Cook County going forth relatively unfettered by County
Ordinance; and
Whereas, a small change in the definition of building height will address this
contradictory
language by clarifying the manner in which building height is measured when there is
no curb present;
NOW THEREFORE BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners
that the Cook County Building Code be amended as follows:
Building Code
Page 10A
Building Height: is the vertical distance measured from the curb level or its
equivalent opposite the center of the front of the building, to the highest point of the
under side of the ceiling beams in the case of a flat roof; to the deck line of a mansard
roof; and the mean level of the under side of the rafters between the eaves and the
ridge of a gable, hip, shed, gambrel, or any other pitched roof. Where no curb level
has been established the height of a building shall be measured from the mean
elevation of the finished existing lot grade at the front of the building.
