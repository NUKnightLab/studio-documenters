impacting several businesses abilities to operate and looking for relief. Mr. Bellant

7. Sarah Feldman of 3815 Grayton came before the Board to ask what steps are being

and quality water for all citizens.

board to discuss the following: a) how many shutoffs have been restored since

since 1975. In the mid-2000's when the wet weather treatment facilities were installed,
they separated the charge from the bill. The bill reflects a sewage charge and a
drainage charge. Over the last year this charge has been distributed equitably across
all customer classes. Every customer is charged based on their hard surfaces.
