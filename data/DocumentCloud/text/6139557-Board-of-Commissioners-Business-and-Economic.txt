a.
An applicant must obtain from the municipality in which the real estate is located or
the County Board if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, an Ordinance or
Resolution expressly stating that the municipality or County Board, as the case may be,
has determined that the incentive provided by Class 6b is necessary for development to
occur on that specific real estate and that the municipality or County Board, as the case
may be, supports and consents to the Class 6b application to the Assessor. A certified
copy of the Ordinance or Resolution need not be filed at the time of filing the Class 6b
eligibility application with the Assessor, but must be filed with the Assessor no later than
the date an assessment appeal is filed to request the class change to Class 6b. If the
Resolution is not filed at the time of the eligibility application, the applicant shall instead
file, at that time, a letter from the municipality or the County, as the case may be,
confirming that a Resolution or Ordinance supporting the incentive has been requested. If
the real estate is located within an Industrial Growth Zone, prior to filing a Class 6b
eligibility application with the Assessor and in lieu of an Ordinance or Resolution, an
applicant must obtain from an authorized officer of the municipality or an authorized
officer of the Cook County Bureau of Economic Development if the real estate is located
in an unincorporated area, a letter stating that the municipality or the County Board, as the
case may be, supports and consents to the filing of the Class 6b application with the
Assessor. A certified copy of the authorized officer letter shall be included with the Class
6b application at the time of filing the application with the Assessor. The application shall
include any other information deemed necessary by the Assessor. The applicant must
demonstrate that the industrial development project qualifies for the Class 6b
classification and shall bear the expense of doing so.
b. A copy of the Resolution, or letter confirming that a Resolution has been requested, or the
letter from an authorized officer if the real estate is in an Industrial Growth Zone,
whichever is filed with the application, will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the
Secretary of the County Board for distribution to the members of the County Board from
the affected districts.
c. Class 6b applications for newly constructed or substantially rehabilitated buildings and other
structures must be made to the Assessor within one year prior to the commencement of
such new construction or substantial rehabilitation to qualify for a Class 6b incentive.
With respect to abandoned property, the Class 6b application must be made to the

 Assessor prior to the commencement of the reoccupation of the vacant and unused
property.
d. In the instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as
defined herein, the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may still
determine that special circumstances justify finding that the property is deemed
"abandoned" for purpose of Class 6b, unless:
1.

There has been a purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have not
been vacant and unused prior to such purchase; or

2.

There has been no purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have
been vacant and unused for less than 24 continuous months.

The finding of abandonment, along with the specification of the special circumstances,
shall be included in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and consenting to the Class
6b application. If the Ordinance or Resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the
County Board is required to validate such a finding that the property is deemed
"abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b, and a County Resolution to that effect shall be
obtained. The applicant must obtain the municipal enabling Ordinance with the required
finding of special circumstances and present such municipal Ordinance to the Board of
Commissioners of Cook County prior to its determination as to whether it will validate
such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b and
provide a County Resolution to that effect. A certified copy of an Ordinance or Resolution
finding that special circumstances exist, as well as a certified copy of a County Ordinance
or Resolution validating such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for
purposes of Class 6b need not be filed at the time of filing the Class 6b eligibility
application with the Assessor, but must be filed with the Assessor no later than the date an
assessment appeal is filed to request the class change to Class 6b. If the Resolution is not
filed at the time of the Class 6b eligibility application, the applicant shall instead file, at
that time, a letter from the municipality or the County as the case may be, confirming that
a Resolution or Ordinance regarding special circumstances has been requested.
If the real estate is located within an Industrial Growth Zone, prior to filing a Class 6b
eligibility application with the Assessor and in lieu of an Ordinance or Resolution, an
applicant must obtain from an authorized officer of the municipality or an authorized
officer of the Cook County Bureau of Economic Development if the real estate is located
in an unincorporated area, a letter stating that the municipality or the County Board, as the
case may be, supports and consents to the filing of the Class 6b application with the
Assessor. A certified copy of the authorized officer letter shall be included with the Class
6b application at the time of filing the application with the Assessor. The application shall
include any other information deemed necessary by the Assessor. The applicant must
demonstrate that the industrial development project qualifies for the Class 6b
classification and shall bear the expense of doing so.
Temporary Emergency Economic Recovery Modification (TEERM) Program: In the
instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as defined

 herein, the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may still determine that
special circumstances justify finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purpose
of a Class 6b under the TEERM Program if there has been no purchase for value and the
buildings and other structures have been vacant and unused for at least 12 continuous
months. The finding of abandonment, along with the specification of the special
circumstances, shall be included in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and
consenting to the Class 6b application under the TEERM Program. If the Ordinance or
Resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the County Board is required to
validate such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b,
and a County Resolution to that effect shall be obtained. The applicant must obtain the
municipal enabling Ordinance with the required finding of special circumstances and
present such municipal Ordinance to the Board of Commissioners of Cook County prior to
its determination as to whether it will validate such a finding that the property is deemed
"abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b and provide a County Resolution to that effect. A
certified copy of an Ordinance or Resolution finding that special circumstances exist, as
well as a certified copy of a County Ordinance or Resolution validating such a finding that
the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b need not be filed at the time
of filing the Class 6b application with the Assessor, but must be filed with the Assessor no
later than the date an assessment appeal is filed to request the class change to Class 6b. If
the Resolution is not filed at the time of the Class 6b application, the applicant shall
instead file, at that time, a letter from the municipality or the County as the case may be,
confirming that a Resolution or Ordinance regarding special circumstances has been
requested.
Sustainable Emergency Relief (SER) Program: In the instance where real estate does not
meet the definition of abandoned property as defined herein, the municipality or the
County Board, as the case may be, may still determine that special circumstances justify
finding that the property is deemed "qualified" for purpose of Class 6b under the SER
Program if:
1.

The industrial enterprise that occupies the premises has been at the same location for
a minimum of ten years prior to the date of application for the SER Program; and

2.

The industrial enterprise that occupies the premises submits evidence of hardship
supporting a determination that participation in the SER Program is necessary for the
industrial enterprise to continue operations at its current location and maintain its
staff, and that without such designation the industrial enterprise would not be
economically viable causing the property to be in imminent risk of becoming vacant
and unused.

The finding that a property is qualified, along with the specification of the special
circumstances, and a determination that the applicant's participation in the SER Program is
necessary for the industrial enterprise to continue operations at its current location and
maintain its staff, and that without such designation the industrial enterprise would not be
economically viable causing the property to be in imminent risk of becoming vacant and
unused, shall be included in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and consenting to the
Class 6b application. If the Ordinance or Resolution is that of a municipality, the approval

 of the County Board is required to validate such a finding that the property is deemed
"qualified" for purposes of Class 6b, and a County Resolution to that effect shall be
obtained. The applicant must obtain the municipal enabling Ordinance with the required
finding of special circumstances and present such municipal Ordinance to the Board of
Commissioners of Cook County prior to its determination as to whether it will validate
such a finding that the property is deemed "qualified" for purposes of Class 6b and
provide a County Resolution to that effect. A certified copy of an Ordinance or Resolution
finding that special circumstances exist, as well as a certified copy of a County Ordinance
or Resolution validating such a finding that the property is deemed "qualified" for
purposes of Class 6b need not be filed at the time of filing the Class 6b application with
the Assessor, but must be filed with the Assessor no later than the date an assessment

appeal is filed to request the class change to Class 6b. If the Resolution is not filed at the
time of the Class 6b application, the applicant shall instead file, at that time, a letter from
the municipality or the County as the case may be, confirming that a Resolution or
Ordinance regarding special circumstances has been requested.
Applications for the TEERM Program or SER Program under a Class 6b application must
be received by the Assessor's Office on or before November 30, 2018 to receive
consideration.
The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of annual reports by recipients of Class
6b incentives granted pursuant to the SER Program as to the use of the property and the
number of persons employed at the Class 6b site. In such reports, recipients shall be
required to certify whether the industrial enterprise that occupied the premises at the time
of the SER application continues its operations at that location. In addition, recipients of
Class 6b incentives granted pursuant to the SER Program shall be required to report to the
Assessor within 30 days if the industrial enterprise that occupied the premises at the time
of the SER application ceases operations at that location. A copy of such reports will be
forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the County Board for distribution to
members of the County Board from the affected districts. Failure to file such reports
