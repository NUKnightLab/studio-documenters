?Other? category with a cumulative total that exceed the threshold amount of $250,000, including
amendments and/or modifications. The recipient must make reporting a requirement of all
sub-awards/loans. All procurement actions are reportable, not just that portion which exceeds
$250,000.

When completing the annual report, recipients are instructed to check the box titled ?annual" in section
13 of the form. For the final report, recipients are instructed to check the box titled ?annual? and the
box indicated for the ?last report? of the project in section 18 of the form. Annual reports are due by
October 30th of each year. Final reports are due by October 30th or 90 days after the end of the project
period, whichever comes first.

The reporting requirement is based on total procurements. Recipients with expended and/or budgeted
funds for procurement are required to report annually whether the planned procurements take place
during the reporting period or not. If no budgeted procurements take place during the reporting period,
the recipient should check the box in section SB when completing the form.

Based on review of the planned budget, this award meets the conditions above and is subject to
the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) Program reporting requirements. However, if the recipient
believes this award does not meet these conditions, it must provide a justification and budget detail
within 21 days of the award date clearly demonstrating that, based on the planned budget, this award is
not subject to the DBE reporting requirements to the Regional or Headquarters point of contact defined
in the correspondence condition, if applicable.

This provision represents an approved deviation from the reporting requirements as
described in 40 CFR, Part 33, Section 33.502; however, the other requirements outlined in 40 CFR Part
33 remain in effect, including the Good Faith Effort requirements as described in 40 CFR Part 33 Subpart
C, and Fair Share Objectives negotiation as described in 40 CFR Part 33 Subpart and explained below.

FAIR SHARE OBJECTIVES, 40 CFR, Part 33, Subpart 
A recipient must negotiate with the appropriate EPA award official, or his/her designee, fair share
objectives for MBE and WBE participation in procurement under the financial assistance agreements.

In accordance with 40 CFR, Section 33.411 some recipients may be exempt from the fair share
objectives requirements as described in 40 CFR, Part 33, Subpart D. Recipients should work with their
DBE coordinator, if they think their organization may qualify for an exemption.

Accepting the Fair Share Objectives/Goals of Another Recipient

The dollar amount of this assistance agreement, or the total dollar amount of all of the recipient?s
financial assistance agreements in the current federal fiscal year from EPA is $250,000, or more. The
recipient accepts the applicable fair share objectives/goals negotiated with EPA by the
Michigan Department Environment, Great Lakes and Energy (MI DEGLE) as follows:

MBE: 10% EQUIPMENT
WBE: 7.5% EQUIPMENT

By signing this financial assistance agreement, the recipient is accepting the fair share objectives/goals
stated above and attests to the fact that it is purchasing the same or similar construction, supplies,
services and equipment, in the same or similar relevant geographic buying market as Michigan
Department Environment, Great Lakes and Energy (MI DEGLE) .

Negotiating Fair Share Objectives/Goals, 40 CFR, Section 33.404

The recipient has the option to negotiate its own fair share objectives/goals. If the recipient
wishes to negotiate its own fair share objectives/goals, the recipient agrees to submit
proposed objectives/goals based on an availability analysis, or disparity study, of qualified
MBEs and WBEs in their relevant geographic buying market for construction, services, supplies and
equipment.

The submission of proposed fair share goals with the supporting analysis or disparity study means that
the recipient is not accepting the fair share objectives/goals of another recipient. The recipient agrees
to submit proposed fair share objectiVes/goals, together with the supporting availability analysis or
disparity study, to the Regional Coordinator within 120 days of its acceptance of the financial
assistance award. EPA will respond to the proposed fair share objective/goals within 30 days of
receiving the submission. If proposed fair share objective/goals are not received within the 120 day
time frame, the recipient may not expend its EPA funds for procurements until the proposed fair share
objective/goals are submitted.

Objective/Goals of Loan Recipients

As a recipient of an EPA financial assistance agreement to capitalize revolving loan funds, the recipient
agrees to either apply its own fair share objectives negotiated with EPA to identified loans using a
substantially similar relevant geographic market, or negotiate separate fair share objectives with its
identified loan recipients. These separate objectives/goals must be based on demonstrable evidence of
the availability of MBEs and WBEs in accordance with 40 CFR, Part 33, Subpart D.

The recipient agrees that if procurements will occur over more than one year, the recipient may choose

to apply the fair share objective in place either for the year in which the identified loan is awarded or
for the year in which the procurement action occurs. The recipient must specify this choice in the
financial assistance agreement, or incorporate it by reference therein.

SIX GOOD FAITH EFFORTS, 40 CFR, Part 33, Subpart 

Pursuant to 40 CFR, Section 33.301, the recipient agrees to make the following good faith efforts
whenever procuring construction, equipment, services and supplies under an EPA financial assistance
agreement, and to require that sub-recipients, loan recipients, and prime contractors also comply.
Records documenting compliance with the six good faith efforts shall be retained:

Ensure DBES are made aware of contracting opportunities to the fullest extent practicable
through outreach and recruitment activities. For Indian Tribal, State and Local and Government
recipients, this will include placing DBEs on solicitation lists and soliciting them whenever they
are potential sources.

Make information on forthcoming opportunities available to DBES and arrange time frames
for contracts and establish delivery schedules, where the requirements permit, in a way that
encourages and facilitates participation by DBES in the competitive process. This includes,
whenever possible, posting solicitations for bids or proposals for a minimum of 30 calendar
days before the bid or proposal closing date.

Consider in the contracting process whether firms competing for large contracts could
subcontract with DBEs. For Indian Tribal, State and local Government recipients, this will
include dividing total requirements when economically feasible into smaller tasks or quantities
to permit maximum participation by DBEs in the competitive process.

Encourage contracting with a consortium of DBES when a contract is too large for one of
these firms to handle individually.

Use the services and assistance of the SBA and the Minority Business Development Agency
of the Department of Commerce.

If the prime contractor awards subcontracts, require the prime contractor to take the steps
in paragraphs through of this section.

CONTRACT ADMINISTRATION PROVISIONS, 40 CFR, Section 33.302
The recipient agrees to comply with the contract administration provisions of 40 CFR, Section 33.302.

BIDDERS LIST, 40 CFR, Section 33.501(b) and 

Recipients of a Continuing Environmental Program Grant or other annual reporting grant, agree to
create and maintain a bidders list. Recipients of an EPA financial assistance agreement to capitalize a
revolving loan fund also agree to require entities receiving identified loans to create and maintain a
bidders list if the recipient of the loan is subject to, or chooses to follow, competitive bidding
requirements. Please see 40 CFR, Section 33.501 and for specific requirements and exemptions.

GRANT-SPECIFIC PROGRAMMATIC TERMS CONDITIONS

FY19 Assessment Cooperative Agreement
Terms and Conditions
Please note that these Terms and Conditions apply to Brownfield Assessment Cooperative

Agreements awarded under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability

Act (CERCLA) 104(k).

I. GENERAL FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS

NOTE: For the purposes of these Terms and Conditions, the term "assessment" includes eligible
activities under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act
(CERCLA) such as activities involving the inventory, characterization, assessment, and
planning relating to brownfield sites as described in the EPA-approved workplan.

A. Federal Policy and Guidance

1.

Cooperative Agreement Recipients: By awarding this cooperative agreement, the

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has approved the prOposal for the Cooperative Agreement
Recipient (CAR) submitted in the Fiscal Year 2019 competition for Brownfield Assessment
cooperative agreements.

 

In implementing this agreement, the CAR shall ensure that work done with cooperative agreement
funds complies with the requirements of CERCLA 104(k). The CAR shall also ensure that
assessment activities supported with cooperative agreement funding comply with all applicable
federal and state laws and regulations.

A term and condition or other legally binding provision shall be included in all subawards entered
into with the funds awarded under this agreement, or when funds awarded under this agreement
are used in combination with non?federal sources of funds, to ensure that the CAR complies with all
applicable federal and state laws and requirements. In addition to 104(k), federal
applicable laws and requirements include 2 CFR Part 200.

The CAR must comply with federal cross-cutting requirements. These requirements include, but are
not limited to, DBE requirements found at 40 CFR Part 33; OSHA Worker Health Safety Standard
29 CFR 1910.120; Uniform Relocation Act (40 USC 61); National Historic Preservation Act (16

Assessment activities generally do not involve construction, alteration, and repair within the
meaning of the Davis?Bacon Act. However, the recipient must contact the EPA Project Officer if
there are unique circumstances removal of an underground storage tank or another structure
and restoration of the site) which indicate that the Davis?Bacon Act applies to an activity the CAR
intends to carry out with funds provided under this agreement. EPA will provide guidance on
Davis-Bacon Act compliance if necessary.

II. SITE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS

A. Eligible Brownfield Site Determinations

1. The CAR must provide information to the EPA Project Officer about site -specific work prior to
incurring any costs under this cooperative agreement for sites that have not already been
pre-approved in the workplan by EPA. The information that must be provided includes
whether the site meets the definition of a brownfield site as defined in 101(39) of CERCLA, and

whether the CAR is the potentially responsible party under CERCLA 107, is exempt from CERCLA
liability and/or has defenses to CERCLA liability.

2. If the site is excluded from the general definition of a brownfield, but is eligible for a
property-specific funding determination, then the CAR may request a property-specific funding
determination from the EPA Project Officer. In its request, the CAR must provide information
sufficient for EPA to make a property-specific funding determination on how financial assistance will
protect human health and the environment, and either promote economic development or enable
the creation of, preservation of, or addition to parks, greenways, undeveloped property, other
recreational property, or other property used for nonprofit purposes. The CAR must not incur costs
for assessing sites requiring a property-specific funding determination by EPA until the EPA Project
Officer has advised the CAR that EPA has determined that the property is eligible.

3. Brownfield Sites Contaminated with Petroleum

a. For any petroleum?contaminated brownfield site that is not included in the 
EPA-approved workplan, the CAR shall provide sufficient documentation to EPA prior to
incurring costs under this cooperative agreement which documents that:

i. the State determines there is "no viable responsible party" for the site;

ii.the State determines that the person assessing or investigating the site is a person
who is not potentially liable for cleaning up the site; and

the site is not subject to any order issued under Section 9003(h) of the Solid Waste
Disposal Act.

This documentation must be prepared by the CAR or the State, following contact and

discussion with the appropriate state petroleum program official. Please contact the EPA
Project Officer for additional information.

b. Documentation must include:
i. the identity of the State program official contacted;
ii.the State official?s telephone number;
the date of the contact; and

iv. a summary of the discussion relating to the State's determination that there is no
viable responsible party and that the person assessing or investigating the site is not
potentially liable for cleaning up the site.

Other documentation provided by a State to the recipient relevant to any of the
determinations by the State must also be provided to the EPA Project Officer.

c. If the State chooses not to make the determinations described in Section II .A.3. above, the
CAR must contact the EPA Project Officer and provide the necessary information for EPA to
make the requisite determinations.

d. EPA will make all determinations on the eligibility of petroleum-contaminated brownfield
sites located on tribal lands reservation lands or lands otherwise in Indian country, as
defined at 18 U.S.C. 1151). Before incurring costs for these sites, the CAR must contact the
EPA Project Officer and provide the necessary information for EPA to make the
determinations described in Section Il.A.3.b. above.

Ill. GENERAL COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT
ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS

A. Sufficient Progress

1. This condition supplements the requirements of the Sufficient Progress Condition (No. 22) in the
General Terms and Conditions. If after 18 months from the date of award, EPA determines that the
CAR has not made sufficient progress in implementing its cooperative agreement, the CAR must
implement a corrective action plan concurred on by the EPA Project Officer and approved by the
Award Official or Grants Management Officer. Alternatively, EPA may terminate this agreement
under 2 CFR 200.339 for material non-compliance with its terms, or with the consent of the CAR
as provided at 2 CFR 200.339, depending on the circumstances. Sufficient progress is indicated
when 35% of funds have been drawn down and disbursed for eligible activities. For assessment
coalition cooperative agreements, sufficient progress is demonstrated when a solicitation for
services has been released, sites are prioritized or an inventory has been initiated (if necessary),
community involvement activities have been initiated and a Memorandum of Agreement is in place,
or other documented activities that demonstrate to satisfaction that the CAR will successfully
perform the cooperative agreement.

B. Substantial Involvement
1. EPA may be substantially involved in overseeing and monitoring this cooperative agreement.

a. Substantial involvement by EPA generally includes administrative activities by the EPA
Project Officer such as monitoring, reviewing project phases, and approving substantive

terms included in professional services contracts. EPA will not direct or recommend that
the CAR enter into a contract with a particular entity.

b. Substantial EPA involvement includes brownfield property-specific funding determinations
described in Section II.A.2. If the CAR awards a subaward for site assessment, the CAR
must obtain technical assistance from EPA on which sites qualify as a brownfield site and
determine whether the statutory prohibition found in applies.
This prohibition does not allow the subrecipient to use EPA cooperative agreement funds
to assess a site for which the subrecipient is potentially liable under 107 of CERCLA.

c. Substantial EPA involvement may include reviewing financial and program performance
reports, monitoring all reporting, record-keeping, and other program requirements.

d. EPA may waive any of the provisions in Section .B.1. with the exception of
property-specific funding determinations, at its own initiative or upon request by the CAR.
The EPA Project Officer will provide waivers in writing.

2. Effects of substantial involvement include:
a. review of any project phase, document, or cost incurred under this cooperative
agreement will not have any effect upon CERCLA 128 Eligible Response Site
determinations or rights, authorities, and actions under CERCLA or any federal statute.

b. The CAR remains responsible for ensuring that all assessments are protective of human
health and the environment and comply with all applicable federal and state laws.

c. The CAR and its subrecipients remain responsible for ensuring costs are allowable under 2
CFR Part 200, Subpart E.

C. Cooperative Agreement Recipient Roles and Responsibilities

1. The CAR must acquire the services of a Qualified Environmental Professional(s) as defined in 40 CFR
312.10 to coordinate, direct, and oversee the brownfield site assessment activities at a given site,
if it does not have such a professional on staff.

3. The CAR is responsible for ensuring that funding received under this cooperative agreement does
not exceed the statutory $200,000 funding limitation for an individual brownfield site. Waiver of
this funding limit for a brownfield site must be submitted to the EPA Project Officer and approved
prior to the expenditure of funding exceeding $200,000. In no case may funding for site-specific
assessment activities exceed $350,000 on a site receiving a waiver. CARs expending funding from a
Community-wide Assessment cooperative agreement must include this amount in any total funding
expended on the site.

4. Cybersecurity The recipient agrees that when collecting and managing environmental data under
this cooperative agreement, it will protect the data by following all applicable State or Tribal law
cybersecurity requirements.

a. EPA must ensure that any connections between the recipient?s network or information
system and EPA networks used by the recipient to transfer data under this agreement are
secure. For purposes of this section, a connection is defined as a dedicated persistent
interface between an Agency IT system and an external IT system for the purpose of

transferring information. Transitory, user-controlled connections such as website browsing
are excluded from this definition.

If the recipient?s connections as defined above do not go through the Environmental
Information Exchange Network or Central Data Exchange, the recipient agrees to
contact the EPA Project Officer (PO) no later than 90 days after the date of this award? for
Tribal and non-State recipients and work with the designated Regional/ Headquarters
Information Security Officer to ensure that the connections meet EPA security
requirements, including entering into Interconnection Service Agreements as appropriate.
This condition does not apply to manual entry of data by the recipient into systems
operated and used by regulatory programs for the submission of reporting and/or
compliance data.

b. The recipient agrees that any subawards it makes under this agreement will require the
subrecipient to comply with the requirements in Cybersecurity Section 3. above if the
subrecipient?s network or information system is connected to EPA networks to transfer
data to the Agency using systems other than the Environmental Information Exchange
Network or EPA's Central Data Exchange. The recipient will be in compliance with this
condition: by including this requirement in subaward agreements; and during subrecipient
monitoring deemed necessary by the recipient under 2 CFR by inquiring
whether the subrecipient has contacted the EPA Project Officer. Nothing in this condition
requires the recipient to contact the EPA Project Officer on behalf of a subrecipient or to be
involved in the negotiation of an Interconnection Service Agreement between the
subrecipient and EPA.

5. All geospatial data created must be consistent with Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC)
endorsed standards. Information on these standards may be found at dcgov.

impose additional QA requirements. Recipients implementing environmental programs within the
scope of the assistance agreement must submit to the EPA Project Officer an approvable Quality
Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) at least 30 days prior to the initiating of data collection or data
compilation. The Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) is the document that provides
comprehensive details about the quality assurance, quality control, and technical activities that
must be implemented to ensure that project objectives are met. Environmental programs include

direct measurements or data generation, environmental modeling, compilation of date from
literature or electronic media, and data supporting the design, construction, and operation of
environmental technology.

The QAPP should be prepared in accordance with EPA EPA Requirements for Quality
Assurance Project Plans.

No environmental data collection or data compilation may occur until the QAPP is approved by the
EPA Project Officer and Quality Assurance Regional Manager. When the recipient is delegating the

State Enabling Legislation Regarding Solid Waste Permit

Modi?cation Process

On August 12, 2019, Council Member Benson requested that the Legislative Policy Division
(LPD) and the Buildings, Safety Engineering and Environmental Department (BSEED) provide
reports describing legal standards and procedures applicable to the permit modi?cation process for
Republic Waste/Dinverno, Inc?s solid waste facility in the City of Detroit.

On September 24, 2019, BSEED issued their report in response to that referral, thoroughly
summarizing the process for review by the Solid Waste Facility Review Committee (SWERC).
Council Member Benson subsequently directed LPD to report regarding the applicable state
enabling legislation.

research identi?es the following statutes as the basic state enabling legislation for the permit
modi?cation process at issue:

a The Michigan Zoning Enabling Act, MCL 125.3201

125.3201 Regulation of land development and establishment of districts; provisions;
uniformity of regulations; designations; limitations.

Sec. 201. (1) A local unit of government may provide by zoning ordinance for the regulation of
land development and the establishment of or more districts within its zoning jurisdiction which
regulate the use of land and structures to meet the needs of the state's citizens for food, ?ber,

1

energy, and other natural resources, places of residence, recreation, industry, trade, service, and
other uses of land, to ensure that use of the land is situated in appropriate locations and
relationships, to limit the inappropriate overcrowding of land and congestion of population,
transportation systems, and other public facilities, to facilitate adequate and ef?cient provision for
transportation systems, sewage disposal, water, energy, education, recreation, and other public
service and facility requirements, and to promote public health, safety, and welfare.

(2) Except as otherwise provided under this act, the regulations shall be uniform for each class of
land or buildings, dwellings, and structures within a district.

(3) A local unit of government may provide under the zoning ordinance for the regulation of land
development and the establishment of districts which apply only to land areas and activities
involved in a special program to achieve speci?c land management objectives and avert or solve
speci?c land use problems, including the regulation of land development and the establishment of
districts in areas subject to damage from ?ooding or beach erosion.

(4) A local unit of government may adopt land development regulations under the zoning
ordinance designating or limiting the location, height, bulk, number of stories, uses, and size of
dwellings, buildings, and structures that may be erected or altered, including tents and recreational
vehicles.

History: 2006, Act 110, Eff. July 1, 2006.

I The Michigan Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act, Act 451 of 1994,
Section 115 Solid Waste Management, MCL 324.11508

324.11508 Solid waste management program; certi?cation.

Sec. 11508. A city, county, or district health department may be certi?ed by the department to
perform a solid waste management program. Certi?cation procedures shall be established by the
department by rule. The department may rescind certi?cation upon request of the certi?ed health
department or after reasonable notice and hearing if the department ?nds that a certi?ed health
department is not performing the program as required.

History: 1994, Act 451, Eff. Mar. 30, 1995.

The Zoning Enabling Act provides for public participation in the process as follows:
125.3103 Notice; publication; mail or personal delivery; requirements.

Sec. 103. (1) Except as otherwise provided under this act, if a local unit of government conducts a
public hearing required under this act, the local unit of government shall publish notice of the
hearing in a newspaper of general circulation in the local unit of government not less than 15 days
before the date of the hearing.

(2) Notice required under this act shall be given as provided under subsection (3) to the owners of
property that is the subject of the request. Notice shall also be given as provided under subsection
(3) to all persons to whom real property is assessed within 300 feet of the property that is the

subject of the request and to the occupants of all structures within 300 feet of the subject property
regardless of whether the property or structure is located in the zoning jurisdiction. Noti?cation
need not be given to more than 1 occupant of a structure, except that if a structure contains more
than 1 dwelling unit or spatial area owned or leased by different persons, 1 occupant of each unit
or spatial area shall be given notice. If a single structure contains more than 4 dwelling units or
other distinct spatial areas owned or leased by different persons, notice may be given to the
manager or owner of the structure, who shall be requested to post the notice at the primary entrance
to the structure.

(3) The notice under subsection (2) is considered to be given when personally delivered or when
deposited during normal business hours for delivery with the United States postal service or other
public or private delivery service. The notice shall be given not less than 15 days before the date
the request will be considered. If the name of the occupant is not known, the term "occupant" may
be used for the intended recipient of the notice.

(4) A notice under this section shall do all of the following:
Describe the nature of the request.
Indicate the property that is the subject of the request. The notice shall include a listing
of all existing street addresses within the property. Street addresses do not need to be
created and listed if no such addresses currently exist within the property. If there are no
street addresses, other means of identi?cation may be used.
(0) State when and where the request will be considered.
Indicate when and where written comments will be received concerning the request.
History: 2006, Act 110, Eff. July 1, 2006;%Am. 2008, Act 12, Imd. Eff. Feb. 29, 2008.

Depending on the particular issues involved in any individual facility or permit modi?cation, there
are myriad speci?c legal standards that may apply. The Zoning Enabling Act and the Solid Waste
Management Act collectively run to over 80 pages of dense, single-spaced text that address many
issues. Other constitutional, statutory, regulatory and common law provisions, such as rules
governing the creation and mitigation of a nuisance, may come into play. Depending on factual
developments any one or more other legal rules may prove decisive. If Council has any other
questions or concerns regarding this subject, LPD will be happy to provide further research and
analysis upon request.

and private parking locations.

If so, what were the results of said study?

Regarding parking is there a median price during no special event?

Regarding parking, is there a median price during a special event?

Can you give me a grid of the least expensive all the way to the highest price

during both options as described above? (Special event verses no special event

pricing)

both public and private spaces please attach to this response.
