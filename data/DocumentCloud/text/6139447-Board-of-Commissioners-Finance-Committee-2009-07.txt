CONSORTIUM AGREEMENT WITH THE CHICAGO METROPOLITAN AREA
FOR PLANNING (CMAP), LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND NON-PROFITS.
Transmitting a Communication, dated July 1, 2009 from Todd H. Stroger,
President, Cook County Board of Commissioners:
Re: Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP2)
I respectfully request approval for Cook County, Illinois to enter into a Consortium
Agreement with the Chicago Metropolitan Area for Planning (CMAP), local
governments and non-profits for the purpose of applying to the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for the competitive application round of
the Neighborhood Stabilization Program known as NSP2. This round of funding is
made available under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(ARRA).

 FINANCE AGENDA
JULY 21, 2009
PAGE 36
When the ARRA was enacted, CMAP convened a group of counties, municipalities
and non-profit organizations in the Chicago region to discuss the advantages of
applying for NSP2 funding on a regional basis. Out of these discussions, a number
of these local governments and non-profits have joined a consortium for the
purpose of developing a regional strategy for deployment of NSP2 funds. I
recommend that Cook County join this consortium, as it offers the strongest
possible application for these competitively awarded funds. The NSP2 funds will
be directed to stabilizing neighborhoods whose viability has been and continues to
be damaged by the economic effects of foreclosed and abandoned properties. I
recommend that Cook County join this consortium for purposes of joint application
and funding among the members, as it will make northeastern Illinois more
competitive for NSP2 dollars and will allow the region to create efficiencies and
build economies of scale when implementing the program. While CMAP will be the
lead agency when applying for NSP2 funds, program implementation will rest solely
with the County of Cook, relative to its geographical boundaries.
I respectfully request approval for the County to join the consortium in pursuing
these available federal funds and that I, or the Chief of the Bureau of Capital,
Planning and Facilities Management or his designee, is authorized to execute on
behalf of the County of Cook, the Consortium Agreement, to be effective as of July
13, 2009, and any and all additional documents necessary further the activity
approved herein. The approval of this agreement by this Honorable Body will
permit staff to execute the necessary documentation to move this application
forward.

Communication, dated June 30, 2009 from Joseph M. Fratto, Chief of Staff and
Interim Chief Financial Officer, Bureau of Finance:
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a professional
services agreement with Information Strategies, Inc., Washington, D.C. (in
partnership with Microsoft), to implement the Microsoft Stimulus 360 Solution to
properly track, monitor and report on the County’s programs funded under the
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA).
Reason:

ARRA funds are intended to be utilized “as quickly as possible
consistent with prudent management.” ARRA funds require very
stringent monitoring and reporting of expenditures and results. The
Microsoft Stimulus 360 Solution provides the most complete tracking
and reporting package for ARRA funds, and can be implemented
within 2 to 4 weeks of contract execution, due to the existing
relationship between Information Strategies, Inc. and Microsoft. This
package has been selected by the State of Illinois and the City of
Chicago, in addition to many other governmental entities nationwide for
the efficient and proper managing of ARRA funds, and using it will
enable the County to work more efficiently with the State to assure
compliance with federal requirements.
This contract is in accordance with the Cook County Procurement Joint
Purchasing Requirement. The City of Chicago obtained competitive
proposals from three firms and selected Information Strategies, Inc. as
offering the best combination of price and speed to implementation.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $30,000.00. Contract period: July 2, 2009 through July
