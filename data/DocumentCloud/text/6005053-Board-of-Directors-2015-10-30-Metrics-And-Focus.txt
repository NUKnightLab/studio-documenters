•

NCQA posts Health Insurance Plan
Rankings on 5-point scale, using
0.5 increments (1.0, 1.5, 2.0, etc.)
CAHPS survey calculates results on
a 3-point scale (1.0-3.0)
For comparison, converted
CountyCare’s 3-point scores to a 5point scale assuming equal
proportion
– E.g. Score 2.4/3 = 0.81*5 = 4.0; or
– 2.4 = 81% of 3; 4.0 = 81% of 5
