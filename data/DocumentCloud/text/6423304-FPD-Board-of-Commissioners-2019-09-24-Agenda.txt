immediately adjacent to land owned by the Forest Preserves and would add, and provide a buffer to, the
Forest Preserve’s holdings in the area.
Through negotiations, Lake Shore Country Club (the “Donor”) has agreed to donate the Property at no
charge to the Forest Preserve. The Forest Preserves shall pay for any direct costs associated with the
conveyance, including but not limited to closing costs. Following the closing, the Forest Preserve will
become vested with fee simple absolute title and the immediate right to possession of the Property.
Permission is now sought, upon satisfactory completion of all due diligence and negotiation of any and all
required documentation as determined by the Forest Preserve’s legal department, to accept the donation
of the Property and to expend funds in an amount not to exceed $10,000.00 to cover any closing costs
associated with the Property.
