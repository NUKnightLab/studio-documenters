 FY2020 Success Factors
• The FY2020 budget proposal aligns with the recently approved CCH strategic plan, IMPACT 2023,
however, success will depend on:
• The ability to meet the uncompensated care demand. Growth in uncompensated care is
unsustainable with current revenues. Public Charge rule may further impact uncompensated care.

• Partnerships with labor, working on efficiencies and process improvements, and patient-centered
focus
• Entering into strategic partnerships with other providers to drive volume, expand access and
enhance quality

• Stability of state and federal programs including the 340B prescription drug program, Affordable
Care Act and Medicaid including DSH (Disproportionate Share Hospital)
• Implementing identified revenue cycle improvements based on best practices
• Modest Medicaid membership growth and stable Medicaid rates

• CountyCare members’ use of CCH services
• Adapting to the dynamic larger healthcare environment

18

 Operational Realities
Reduced reliance on local taxpayer support despite significant budget growth.
• Annual growth in Correctional Health & Public Health beyond allocation.
• Salary and benefit increases related to Collective Bargaining Agreements.

• Like all health systems, CCH is subject to cost increases in pharmaceuticals, equipment and supplies.
• Reduction in local tax allocation has allowed Cook County to reallocate more than $2.5B since 2009.
No other County agency has done this.

Significant growth in demand for Charity Care (grew by more than $100M since 2017).
• CCH provides more than 50% of the charity care in Cook County.
• Growing patient care revenue is CCH’s only source to fund continued growth in charity care. To
generate these revenues requires CCH to compete with organizations that have considerably more
resources/amenities and may require limits on charity care.

19

 Uncompensated Care =
Bad Debt + Charity Care

 Uncompensated Care Trends in the US
Uncompensated care (bad debt + charity care) costs increased in 2016, for
the first time since the 2014 expansion of Medicaid. From 2015 to 2016,
uncompensated care costs increased by $2.3B (6.4%) from $36.1B to
$38.4B.

 How did CCH manage until now?
CountyCare contributions to CCH
• CountyCare has contributed more than $1B to CCH since 2014

Attracting and billing for more insured patients
• In 2014, the health system generated 853K bills versus 1.344 million in 2017
– a 58% increase in just three years.

Federal Funds:
• Benefits Improvement Protection Act (Federal)
• Disproportionate Share Hospital Payments (DSH)

29

 Where do we go from here to cover the gap*?
State & Federal Policy Options
• Universal coverage
• Requirements for private, non-profit hospitals to do more
Potential CCH Strategies
• Additional Federal funding
• Additional State funding
• Additional County funding
• Growth and increased capture of insured patient revenue.
• Limit charity care to BIPA+DSH

• Discontinue services and/or consolidate facilities

*Charity Care - BIPA+DSH = Gap
