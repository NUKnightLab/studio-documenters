of Commissioners:
Pursuant to the Cook County Inspector General Ordinance, I hereby appoint the Acting
Inspector General, Mr. JOSEPH PRICE, for a three (3) year tenn to serve as Cook County
Inspector General.
I submit this communication for your approval.
*Referred to the Committee on Legislation & Intergovernmental Relations on 5/18/04.

1706

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 3, 2004

Chairman Suffredin asked which Police Department is giving the Inspector General the police power.
Joseph Price, Acting Cook County Inspector General, stated that currently the police power is from the
Forest Preserve District Police Department.
Chairnrnn Suffredin asked what if any obligations does the Forest Preserve District Police Department
have on the Inspector General by giving you those police powers.
Mr. Price responded "none".
Chairman Suffredin asked how the police powers relate to the Inspector General ' s Ordinance powers as
Inspector General.
Mr. Price stated that the police power gives the Inspector General the ability to access confidential police
records and also gives him the power of arrests.
Chainnan Suffredin stated that he had asked Mr. Price to review the new Cook County Ethics Ordinance
that was passed by the Cook County Board. He asked how the Inspector General's responsibilities tie
into the issues raised in the Ethics Ordinance.
Mr. Price stated that in the Ordinance itself it is stated that all the reports are forwarded to President
Stroger are confidential and it is for the President to make any additional dissemination of those reports.
Further, Mr. Price stated that there is an annual report that is prepared by the Inspector General's Office
and forwarded both to President Stroger as well as to the Legislation and Intergovernmental Relations
Committee.
Chairman Suffredin stated that the committee has not received an annual report in some time, and that
he' s looking forward to receiving an annual report.
Chainnan Suffredin stated that the County Board passed the Whistle Blower Protection Ordinance which
encompasses State law; he asked Mr. Price how he views his responsibilities in relationship to that State
protection for workers.
Mr. Price responded that the Whistle Blower Protection Ordinance is a very important law and in many
incidences it is difficult to get people to come forward if they feel that there is a possibility that there will
be retaliation. Further, Mr. Price stated that this new law gives them the protection that they need to come
forward with items that nonnally would not be seen.
Commissioner Daley stated that the motion for Mr. Price's appointment should be amended to include the
three year tenn to which Joseph Price has been appointed.
Commissioner Daley asked if an Intergovernmental Agreement was necessary.
Patrick Driscoll, State' s Attorney's Office, stated that the Intergovernmental Agreement between the
Forest Preserve District and Cook County is something that needs to be reviewed.
Commissioner Daley requested that once the report is completed by the State' s Attorney's Office a copy
be forwarded to Chairman Suffredin.
Commissioner Sims asked the County to revisit the issue of Mr. Price getting his police powers back from
the Sheriff s Office.

1707

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 3, 2004

Mr. Price stated that both offices have the status of Peace Officers in the State of Illinois. Further, Mr.

Mr. Price stated that the position of the Deputy Inspector General has not been filled.
Chairman Suffredin asked how many investigators other than himself Mr. Price has working for him.
