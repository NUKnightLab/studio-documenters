Report from Chief of Human Resources (continued)
Director Velasquez inquired regarding information on the racial composition of those hired by the System, and on
those who leave or separate from the System. Ms. Lopez responded that she can generate that report1.
Board Chairman Carvalho stated that, approximately two or three years ago, Dr. Enrique Martinez made a
presentation on the racial and ethnic makeup of the organization as a whole. The Human Resources Committee
and Board have not received an update on the subject since then; it would be useful to get a status update on that
subject, along with information on the goals and objectives2.
The Committee discussed the subject of hiring employees who are fluent in other languages besides English.
Director Velasquez inquired whether the question of fluency in another language, especially Spanish, Polish and
Mandarin Chinese languages, is posed to all applicants. Ms. Lopez responded that, if fluency in another language
besides English is a requirement or preference for that position, then yes, this question would be posed at the time
the applicant applies through the Taleo System. During the discussion of the subject, Board Chairman Carvalho
noted that the System also has to have a mechanism for dealing with multiple languages within the facility that
goes beyond having individuals who speak those languages; the utilization of interpreters for these purposes
allows the facility to have other options to provide for the exchange of communication between the patient and
provider, rather than only having the option of a language match-up between the provider and patient. Director
Velasquez stated that communication is essential, and in health care it becomes critical. She understands the
massive challenges that the System faces, but at the same time, this institution should have the ability to address
some of the issues. Ms. Lopez noted that staff is working on addressing some of the issues. She provided an
example regarding medical assistants, who are in most of the clinics - those positions were posted with
requirements that were based on certain percentages of the positions that were required to be fluent in another
language, including Spanish, Polish and other languages.

IV.

Action Items
C. Proposed Collective Bargaining Agreement (continued)
Request for the number of individuals covered by this proposed agreement.
Request for information on the trainees and apprentices 1) how inclusive is the trainee program amongst all the minorities?
2) do individuals in the trainee program have priority status conferred upon them to fill vacancies?
3) how many individuals are in the trainee program?
Request for racial/ethnic breakdown of Engineers.
Request for information on duties and responsibilities of Operating Engineer IV position.
Request for information on licensing for trades.
Request for information on whether prospective external candidates need to already be a member of
whatever union in order to apply for the position.
Mr. Frey responded that he will provide the information to address the requests.
With regard to the subject of posting of vacant positions, Ms. Lopez stated that the Engineers are part of the
trades. The trades have provisions in their CBA that dictates how the posting is processed - usually it is posted
internally within the System first, then it is posted internally County-wide; this is unique, most of the System’s
other positions are posted internally for CCHHS, then are posted externally.
Board Chairman Carvalho inquired whether the mechanisms in place to prevent the hiring for these types of
positions from being done on a political basis are the same mechanisms that are in place for the other positions.
Ms. Lopez responded affirmatively. Sherrie Travis, representing the Office of the Cook County Shakman
Compliance Officer provided information relating to the Employment Plan. Additionally, she addressed the
question of whether prospective external candidates need to already be a member of whatever union in order to
apply for the position. She stated that, generally speaking, if the position is union-specific, if it is not filled
internally through whatever CBA process there is, it is open to the world in general – the only requirement is
that, if an individual is hired into a union-specific position, then that individual would need to become a
member of that union.
Director Hammock, seconded by Director Velasquez, moved to approve the proposed
Collective Bargaining Agreement with Local 399, Operating Engineers, for prevailing
wage rates. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
